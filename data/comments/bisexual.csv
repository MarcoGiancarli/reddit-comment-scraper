bisexual,3e3f0f,muhroads21,33,Tue Jul 21 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"You say that ""the government shouldn't be in the marriage business"". Well sorry to say, my bisexual comrade, but the government is the ONLY institution that should be in the marriage business. Marriage certainly has religious meaning for many (even most) people, but in the modern era marriage is an issue of taxation and benefits. It's a legal issue. Who controls legal issues? The government. Given the fact that they govern a nation of diverse ethnic and religious values, you cannot allow those cultures to define marriage for themselves (thus likely creating many, often contradictory and mutually exclusive, definitions of marriage) when ultimately it's the government who is responsible for officiating and keeping track of who is and isn't married. So you're just wrong on that count. One thing I'm especially curious about is what the 'right' way to bring about same-sex marriage would be.  The reason that people seem less accepting is because there's a history of oppression against the LGBT community. This has, unfortunately, created an ""us vs. them"" mentality against social conservatives for many people. That's not right, and it's not productive either, but that's the reality. When you look or talk like someone who opposes the removal of any number of oppressive cultural norms against the LGBT community, you make enemies.  You shouldn't feel scared to speak your mind, but I get it. People get hostile and it's not cool. But you SHOULD have the right to engage in reasonable discussion on these topics. Debates should be welcomed, because we can all learn something from different views. Unfortunately though, some people (maybe you're included in this, maybe not, I don't know you) are unwilling to accept any measure of error on their own parts and rather than growing as people they end up getting offended or hurt by the end of the conversation.  I don't support you feeling attacked or shunned. This community is supposed to be about acceptance. I wish there could be more dialogue on both sides."

bisexual,3e3f0f,EightEx,3,Tue Jul 21 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"Yea marriage is federal business, they are the ones that recognize the marriage.   Yea, it drives me crazy when people say that the government shouldn't be in marriage at all because it shows a fundamental lack of understanding about the fallout it would cause.  So what, when two people get married in a church they should apply for next-of-kin benefits, tax benefits, and such individually?  You'd have to pay a lawyer a few thousand dollars to draw up the immense amount of paperwork for all of this because it would essentially be a complex power of attorney situation, and then you'd have to cart around a binder of information everywhere you go to prove that you have PoA with this other person at the bank, hospitals, with your tax accountant, everywhere you go for some sort of official recognition.  Marriage exists to simplify this."
bisexual,3e3f0f,hypnofed,2,Tue Jul 21 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"Just to play devil's advocate, the reply is that marriage shouldn't give you tax benefits or other rights. It's usually a Libertarian standpoint, so they think you should just deal with that through legal contracts and such, without the government.  I'm not behind that viewpoint, but the argument is not that ""marriage is religious"", the argument is more than ""marriage shouldn't be about benefits and taxes"""
bisexual,3e3f0f,ottawadeveloper,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:29 2015 UTC,"This is my idea. The institution is wrong, but until such a time as it can be removed, I won't let anyone be denied the associated privileges on grounds of their sexual or gender identity.  As for it being a libertarian stance, I'd say it's just as much an anti-authoritarian stance. I generally don't want the state to monopolize anything but that's not synonymous with me wanting corporations (or organizations, religious or otherwise) to."

bisexual,3e3f0f,SmaragdineSon,7,Tue Jul 21 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"The reason that religion gets bashed on here is because the vast majority of opposition to LGBT causes is from religious groups.  Atheists tend not to have any reason to be against us.  Now, there is a great mass of moderate religious people who have no problems with LGBT stuff, and that's great, but the simple fact is that statistically, the more religious one is, the more likely they are to oppose LGBT rights of any kind.  Conservative Christians and Muslims have declared themselves to be our enemy, so it stands to reason that we're not big fans of them.  I absolutely agree that conservatively religious folks shouldn't be welcomed as friends without question.  The unfortunate side is that the many moderate Christians and Muslims, or even economically conservative folks are not our enemies yet they still get treated as such.  It think its a case of ""better safe than sorry"", LGBT members have been burned by reactionaries and conservatives far too many times to not be apprehensive.  Also, if I may ask, what are your controversial views about transgender issues?"

That's just more of the No True Scotsman fallacy.  The fact is that the religions were made over a long period of time and constantly contradict themselves.  You could similarly make the argument that ISIS and Al Qaeda are the truest members of Islam and that abortion-clinic-bombers and Westboro Baptist Church are the truest Christians.  Different people just follow different parts of the holy books.  Some people skip the love, some people skip the hate, but it's all there."

That's not racist; it's rational.  The thing is, religious extremists are not arguing from a place of rationality, but from overzealous emotion.  People who bomb abortion clinics are clearly ignoring the ""thou shalt not kill"" part.  But somehow, because their killings are a ""righteous attempt to right a wrong"" in God's eyes, that they insist that they will be forgiven.  Or see themselves as a martyr.  Until members of a group are criticized or ostracized by the group at large, crazies will take the silent majority as either a vote to continue their cause or the silence of the weak-hearted that don't have the ""strength to do what needs to be done."""

They know this, but they don't know I'm bi. They still think gays = pedophiles. I had a conversation about how the reason the gay community wants to be involved in the boy scouts is because they want to molest them. Seriously.  But I dodge all that because I'm closeted. So even though it hurts deeply, I can avoid making it affect me directly and personally...at least on the surface. A lot of people don't have that luxury. That said, I know what you mean.

As a bi woman, my biggest fears are (1) Falling in love with another woman and breaking my monogamous cis male partner's heart; or (2) him breaking up with me because he can't deal with a bisexual partner. That also extends to being afraid of dating; I can't tell you how often I've been rejected by lesbians looking for that goddam ""gold star."" The trick is to find someone who is supportive of you as a person, bisexuality and all. It sounds like your former gf was emphatically not. Well, fuck her, too.  Supportive partners are out there.

Let bisexuality be a freedom to express attraction to both sexes or genders, not some kind of confining mental prison. As for support, you don't need the support from the bi, gay, or straight communities. Look to the friends and family who will support TY1DN9, not an internet board of people who don't know you.

That was my first thought when I read your post. Of course, he might not be open (hehe) to that, but you'll never know if you don't ask."
bisexual,3e1fwg,dunno21,13,Tue Jul 21 05:40:33 2015 UTC,"If you want to sleep with other people without your boyfriend around, then it's time to dump your boyfriend. Don't be an asshole and start being a cheater. It doesn't matter if it's with guys or girls, the point is you want to explore."
bisexual,3e1fwg,subdep,3,Tue Jul 21 05:50:48 2015 UTC,"I think you need to break up in all honesty. Take it from somebody who was in exactly the same boat (except the threesome). I feel I haven't explored my sexuality enough and now that I'm newly single I feel much lighter. I probably would have cheated with a girl in fact I nearly did and you don't want that added pressure of the guilt as well as doing it in the first place. It's one of those things that you need to get out of your system. I hope it all goes well, if you need to pm me then go ahead :D"
bisexual,3e1fwg,jewgram,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I are open to me exploring my sexuality with other women, without him needing to be present. This is something we agreed to and he is absolutely comfortable with. If he is at all hesitant, I don't move forward with it, period.  If your boyfriend is not prepared for this to happen, that is absolutely fine (I cannot blame him for being uncomfortable), but you have to evaluate whether your need to explore is more important than your relationship. There is no ""right"" answer for this; it depends on which means more to you.  I know for myself, if my guy was not comfortable, I can spend the rest of my life without ever dating or kissing or fucking a girl, and I'll be happy with him. We've been together for several years; I'm not willing to throw that away.   But your situation and your relationship is different. You've got to make the decision based on your own needs and preferences, and what's important to you. (Just don't cheat. There's no excuse for that.)"
bisexual,3e1b1u,kleptoclarence,4,Tue Jul 21 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"I am the husband of a bisexual wife who is just now realizing just how deep her orientation is and is getting over the guilt from a childhood growing up in the church. I am the one coaxing her out of her guilt spiral because I love her for who she is and don't want her to feel like she has to repress anything. I want to spend my life with this woman and I would rather be right by her side as she figures herself out than be in the midst of a bitter divorce years down the road.  In other words, it's always best to have very clear and open conversations with your partner about your feelings. I really hope for your sake that he is an understanding person who will welcome your honesty. In my experience it has brought us even closer together and I haven't even for a second doubted her commitment to me. It gets difficult when you try to handle your deeper feelings alone and shut the other person out. That will lead to becoming closed off and possibly bitter from what I've seen elsewhere.   My wife has never been with a woman but I can tell that she probably will need to based on her reactions to things during our conversations. I've already told her that if it is something she needs to explore that she may, as long as she doesn't ever hide anything from me."

I know too many gay and bi people, myself included, who screwed up their lives trying to be straight; it didn't work because I'm not straight.  People can be born bisexual just like being gay.  And if I've learned anything from reading this sub, it's that we do have our own unique struggles and experiences that define us.  Which is a lot more than just a label."
bisexual,3e271h,ou_tis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean by it being a form of erasure. You feel its diminishing to just say everyone is bisexual even though they didn't go through the things some of us went through. But I believe the intention is open up understanding about human sexuality. We are all sexual creatures and most all of us are capable of expressing that sexuality with any gender. Theres some good research by Dr. James Hicks that found a lot of straight people are more open to same-sex experiences than not. Even though they may not struggle with understanding their sexuality, even though they haven't yet experienced those attractions, it would be a form of erasure not to acknowledge that they could.   At the end of the day we are justsexual, most of the reasons people struggle with sexuality is because we think we're different. What if everyone else was like us? What if we just squashed the sexuality thing all together and let everyone just be?"
bisexual,3e271h,Gallifreyan_fez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:17 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this concept.   If I'm 100% honest, I believe in fluid sexuality. I think that people pick labels that fit closest, but that with the right circumstances and right person, things can change. I've read tons of stories on reddit and elsewhere where someone says ""I've been straight all my life but I have sexual feelings for my same sex friend!"" Or ""I've always been gay but now I've fallen for this opposite sex person!""  HOWEVER. This notion really plays into that ugly thing that bigots like to say to lesbians ""you just haven't found the right man yet"". I don't think EVERYONE experiences fluid sexuality. I think more people do than people admit though.   Some people find labels important. I've heard people say before that everyone is bi whether they admit it or not, and I think this is as ignorant as saying ""no one is really gay"" like religious fundamentalists do. I have my own feelings and theories on human sexuality, but I think the most important thing is to let everyone self-label.   Some people oppose this notion. I read a reddit thread where a guy was saying that his wife came out as a lesbian, but that she didn't want to dump him and that their sex life was good. People were saying ""she's not a lesbian, she's bi"". And I can certainly see where that comes from. But it's not my job to tell her she picked the wrong label. I also don't know her life, and just because he says certain things doesn't mean they happen exactly as he said them. I caught a lot of flack for saying she should pick her own label, but I stand by it.   I do wish that more people allowed themselves more flexibility and that our society didn't cling to labels so tightly, but it's not my job to define the experiences of others. So it isn't right to say ""everyone is bi"" or ""everyone is flexible in the right circumstance"". I believe in allowing flexibility for others if they claim it. If someone tells me they are a lesbian but there's just this ONE guy who works for them, I don't slap their wrists and call them a bad lesbian. If a straight guy falls for ONE guy, I don't tell them they have to call themselves gay or bi now. I simply believe in choosing the label that feels most right, even if it isn't perfect. And I believe in people doing that for themselves."
bisexual,3e271h,Gallifreyan_fez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with what everything you said although I would like to get to the point where we move past labels, self and otherwise as a whole. The thing is sex is a basic human need, but we've somehow inflated into our sense of identity, Foucault talks about this. We don't identify ourselves by how we carry out any of our other basic needs, and we certainly don't have identity crises if we choose to add or remove a category of food from our diet. Why is it so for sex?  If people want to identify as one thing or another thats fine. I live with a guy that identifies as straight but has said he's not afraid of falling in love with a man. He also is someone who agrees people are probably innately bisexual. It's that kind of thinking that keeps people from existential crises when they fall in love with their friends and at the very least would make it easier for everyone to come to terms with their attractions."

And during that week I was absolutely exclusively attracted to guys. I wasn't at all into the idea of women. But that was mostly because this recent self revelation had just messed with my identity a lot and I wasn't in a good place.  Then after I calmed down I realized that my attraction to women hadn't simply disappeared and it was always there and always will be, just like my attraction to men has always been there but I simply hadn't noticed it.

Not to say that there isn't a chance that you are gay and are very repressed or something, just food for thought."
bisexual,3dzbu1,Harry4a2,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"You can't be aroused passively by something for a decade and suddenly have it evaporate in a puff of smoke. If the feelings were real and your attractions to women were a strong driving force in your teenage years then they'll likely always be with you in some form. They may hibernate at times but they can always come back with a vengeance.  Similarly your attractions to men probably hibernated for quite some time until you started exploring them more and allowing them to roam freely in your mind more.  Different people go different directions. Some get to 50-50 and stay around there. Some do a 180 gradually over time in their orientation--their feelings can be genuine at all points but they shift from being mostly straight towards liking the same sex a good amount more (not exclusively though). For some, they continue to see female beauty for instance, but stop associating it with sexual desire like they did in their teens. It becomes beauty like a painting, basically. That can happen. (Same for women who see male beauty but shift towards being mostly interested in women)."
bisexual,3dzbu1,Vatnos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible. Loads of lesbians take a long time to realize that they're gay because they don't actually know what arousal or attraction feel like. Once you open yourself up to the possibility of attraction to someone other than the default, you may realize that you haven't really been experiencing the real thing.  But you may also be overthinking it. Try not to worry about it and just take it as it comes."

bisexual,3dzbu1,Ildri4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:27 2015 UTC,"The fact that you are questioning whether youve ever found girls attractive, while stating that youve experienced biological responses to females is a pretty good indicator that you might be bi, and do in fact like girls.  I can relate a bit, to back when I started to experiment with men. I had always been attracted to women and never questioned my heterosexuality. I hadnt ever had a girlfriend or been with a girl other than some kissing, and I was into that. My first sexual experience happened just after high school, and it was with a guy 10 years older than me. It kind of happened because I wanted some actual sexual experience and found it was easy talking to guys online. So, I made it happen. I was confused because I liked it. Did this mean that I was gay? Had I always just thought that I was straight? But, I still had a crush on a girl... but, I was still open to doing that again with a guy...   Its confusing, but theres not a good reason to believe that your past attractions werent real. Even if you never found another girl attractive, there is nothing to be gained from denying how you once felt. It took some time for me to figure out that its okay to like both. I had been with some more guys, and at the same time I still liked girls."

bisexual,3dy76u,shadowhunter920,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:22 2015 UTC,there's a case to be made that what truly distinguishes a psychologically healthy bisexual from a homosexual or heterosexual is that we don't let some  intellectual category limit who we are sexually aroused by.  Just live and let live. If you get a boner (or wet) great: the system is working.  The next step is the real hurdle: making sure anything you do is enthusiastically consensual.

bisexual,3dynep,MatticusVP,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I are both bi, and in the swinging lifestyle. Sadly, not too many swingers are looking for single men, especially because theyre easy to find when they are. Other than some swing sites, we occasionally use craigslist, especially when we're just looking for a single guy.  If you go this route I'll give you a few tips... always write an actual response stating you stats, what youre into (in and out of the bedroom), what youre looking for, and how you can help accomplish what they are looking for.   Whenever we put up an ad looking for singles guys we'll easily get upwards of 100 responses, but clearly we only need one guy. This means any response that isnt fairly detailed will be rejected immediately. Can't be bothered to tell us about you? Well, we can't be bothered to give you a shot, because another response will come from someone else in a few minutes.  Photos help. Real photos. Dick pics are far less important than face or body pics. I dont care if you have a nice dick, if the rest of you is unappealing you won't get a response."

bisexual,3dx8v9,sagelobu,3,Mon Jul 20 08:28:17 2015 UTC,"Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of Unicorn :      Colloquial; Synonym for hot bi babe or HBB, often derogatory, condescending, or ironic. A bisexual person, usually though not always female, who is willing to join an existing couple, often with the presumption that this person will date and become sexually involved with both members of that couple, and not demand anything or do anything which might cause problems or inconvenience to that couple.  The term is often used to be dismissive of a couple seen to be only superficially polyamorous. Because of the demands that this type of couple places on the woman (that she be single and not take on any additional partners, and become involved with both members of the couple equally, and often ""complete"" their family as a surrogate mother and housekeeper and/or breadwinner and not do anything that may threaten or disrupt the existing couple), many in the poly community call this type of woman a ""unicorn"", as in mythical and not likely to be found, even though there are plenty of bipoly women around.  Sometimes the unicorn is expected to not develop any emotional attachment and is strictly there for a sexual relationship (equally distributed to both members of the dyad) and/or is prescripted as a secondary. This term is used as a reminder that bipoly women are people with their own desires, needs, and pre-existing lives, and not fantasy figures or pets. See related prescriptive vs. descriptive.     John wants a single, attractive woman who will love and have sex equally with him and his wife, but not interfere with their marriage, move in together, help raise their kids but not have any of her own, and not have any other partners. He's looking for something that doesn't exist - he's looking for a unicorn!    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"
bisexual,3dx8v9,autourbanbot,2,Mon Jul 20 08:28:23 2015 UTC,That sounds less like a sexual orientation and more like a selfish fantasy. Which I'm guessing is the point.

And you're not ""faking it"" if you genuinely believe you could be bi. Even if it does turn out to be a phase that's fine, your experience is valid, and people who try to use your experience to perpetuate stereotypes are in the wrong not you.   Personally I feel it would probably better if you don't use the term heteroflexible though since it's often just used to add to the erasure of bi people. It'd be better off to say you're bi with a preference"

When I'm out an about on the street I check out men as much as women, and although I find both attractive I have a greater desire to have sex with a woman. I have other bi friends, but it seems like they're the opposite of me (more into guys than girls) so it makes me feel ""not bi enough"" based on what I've read on this sub I would say try not to nitpick your sexuality so much. Just do what you need to do in terms of being comfortable with yourself, then the label will come as well. I've been trying it and it seems to be working so far, so hopefully it'll work for you too.

bisexual,3dtwpg,Justice_Prince,24,Sun Jul 19 23:30:12 2015 UTC,"In some ways, I almost think these articles are more important than including bi people to begin with.   Well, no. Obviously it would be awesome if bi-erasure wasn't a problem and bi people were included to begin with. But, since bi-erasure is a problem, I appreciate articles that take the time to specifically highlight it and acknowledge that it is a concept which requires additional forethought. I think that's a big step in the right direction, since many people are not even aware of the many ways they erase bi people and other groups (similar to the way most people using binary gender language aren't even aware that they're excluding non-binary trans people).   And yes, I think this is a fantastic apology. None of this ""sorry you were offended"" bullshit, but straight up ""I messed up, sorry. I'll work to be better in the future"". It's very gracious and concise."
bisexual,3dtwpg,keakealani,18,Sun Jul 19 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate the writer's apology, I honestly don't think that this is a big deal.   As a bisexual person, I'm definitely not okay with bi erasure. But to me, this doesn't really fit the bill for what offends me. When people tell me that bi people are just confused and not actually bi, or that we have it easier than lesbian and gay people, I feel like that's bi erasure. But forgetting to specifically include bisexual people in an article about LGBT issues while the author of the article specifically uses the acronym LGBT? That's not something I feel is necessary to be up in arms about. That's just my opinion though."
bisexual,3dtwpg,Ellebogen,4,Sun Jul 19 19:59:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. Also saying ""finally now bisexuals can get married"" is false. We could get married before the ruling, we just couldn't get married to someone of the same gender.  It is awkward to say ""Now gay, lesbian and bisexual couples can get a married to someone of the same gender"", as if you say ""Now gay, lesbian and bisexual couples can get a married"" it is inaccurate.   Bisexual erasure is when there is a rumor that someone hooked up with someone of the same gender and everyone immediately says they must be homosexual, especially when that person has been in heterosexual relationships in the past.  But not including the word bisexual in this is not erasure."
bisexual,3dtwpg,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,3,Mon Jul 20 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was either. Because it isn't actually ""gay and lesbian marriage"", it's ""same sex marriage"" or ""different sex marriage"". Regardless of our attraction, we're still going to fall into one category or the other.  There's no escaping it (aside from the very few who are intersex and for whatever reason haven't claimed one sex or the other)."

That's not bi erasure, that's just biphobia. Erasure is a specific aspect of biphobia where bisexuality is excluded as an option, or   In my experiences, a lot of the time, people use ""LGBT"" and ""lesbian and gay"" interchangeably, and to me, it always gives the vibe that they're not thinking about me. They're thinking about the LG part, and using the acronym doesn't automatically make it inclusive if you're not acknowledging half of it. And I've see passionate ""LGBT activists"" talking about how trans women are really just men, and ""bihets"" aren't welcome in LGBT communities, so personally I feel like using the acronym and specifically acknowledging bi (or trans) people are very different. Plus, even if the author was thinking about the entire LGBT community, there's a lot of people who were just celebrating gay and lesbian people without thinking about the others, so acknowledging the others doesn't hurt, y'know?   Anyway, that's just my perspective and why i feel differently to you :)"

If a guy is into you they tend to be persistent.

I usually come across as straight when I go out and a lot of other men are into that. Are you more of a dominant persona, do you pursue someone or do you like others to take the lead? Either way you'll find out pretty fast if people are into you.  Most of all relax.

If I could ask, what are you looking for exactly? Because I don't see a fwb being so different from a girlfriend. You'd hang out as friends presumably going to dinner or the movies or whatever you'd do on a date and you'd have sex. So what's the difference?

I assumed the friends in friends with benefits meant you'd also have a friendship not just hook up. I guess just talk to him and see what he thinks the whole thing should look like. How would he be most comfortable, what are his expectations and talk about yours. Good luck."

What I can say is that having lots of talks about the exactchanges in your relationship could be very important. What your husband considers the difference between a friend with benefits and a girlfriend is something that you should make him clear about. If he is ok with you having sex with someone, but not ok with you spending the night with them, make sure you know. I think you should approach it as a conversation about what you both are ok with and make sure he knows what you need. It's really hard to do with someone you trully love, and its scary, but it is also worth it."

Sometimes close friends do wander into touchy territory, but I wouldn't call that an indication of his (or your) bisexuality. As for your bisexuality, only you can really know that. It can take a long time to figure out (I've been thinking about it for two years so far).   Also, especially if you're socially inexperienced (like me), it can be hard to distinguish getting close to a friend from a getting feelings for someone/ a crush. But, I'm not in your head. If you think you're genuinely developing feelings for this guy, you probably are.   TL;DR: Don't jump to conclusions. You might just be getting to be close friends with this guy...However, take my advice with a grain of salt, I'm not there with you, and I'm not in either of your heads. Good luck, though!"
bisexual,3dwfiu,Mondonodo,3,Mon Jul 20 03:24:29 2015 UTC,"In my humble experience.... The fact he jokes about being a couple and similar it's not a sign of being interested in you, and is in fact a totally common thing among straight guys who are confortable and secure of their heterosexuality. Those feelings you have for him could be just the normal feelings between two really close best friends, or not. Don't read to much into it, buddy!

For many people they are, but not for everyone.  I (a lady) personally don't know if my interest in women is purely sexual, or also romantic. I know I'm attracted to men in both sexual and romantic ways, but my attraction to women might only be sexually. I only accepted my bisexuality recently, and so I'm still in the process of figuring out what this means to me and what (if anything) I'll do about it.  I've never dated or fucked another girl, but I'd like to, so I talked with my boyfriend about it. So, he and I have a semi-open relationship, so I can explore my sexuality with his knowledge and without breaking our trust and commitment to each other. (I can also date other men and he other women, but neither of us has taken advantage of this freedom yet. Hence why I said ""semi"" open.) My goal is to go on at least one date with another girl, if only I could figure out how. I'm clueless when it comes to attracting mates, regardless of their gender.  Maybe you're in a relationship that can be opened up or made not strictly monogamous. Maybe he's open to threesomes, or you and another lady putting on a show for him. Or maybe you stay in your relationship as it is and enjoy the fun, kinky sex you share together. It's up to you to decide if you'd like to discuss having other sexual partners, or if you're happy with your current relationship as it is."

bisexual,3dw3oa,Owlboy63,2,Mon Jul 20 00:46:18 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents, but as there are more than two genders it can be useful to say ""all genders"" or ""more than one gender"" instead of ""both genders"" or ""opposite genders."" And yeah, while a lot of bi people are sexually and romantically attracted to more than one gender in the same ways, it'd be great if more people understood that there are more nuances to attraction!"
bisexual,3dw3oa,rab0t,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:45 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to only include male and females in my post I was just referring to the bi part of bi sexual as opposed to pansexual. I apologize.
bisexual,3dw3oa,rab0t,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:52:28 2015 UTC,"No worries! Just thought I'd give you some alternative language to think about. :) FWIW, some bi people (myself included) take the ""bi"" to mean that you can be attracted to your own gender as well as other genders. However you define that is up to you, though! Definitely not trying to be the identity police or anything."
bisexual,3dw3oa,Knightsdawn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely. Romance and sex are different things that different people want from different other people with different genders.  I myself would never want to be in a relationship with the same gender (completely unappealing), but the physical attraction is still there."

Please list in inappropriate detail what/when/where/who you have done and to what degree, so that I can decide your sexuality for you, kthx"" and back then I wasn't assertive enough to just tell them off. Something like this was exactly what I needed back then so I love that she put it out there.  As an adult I'm very involved in local (Denmark) LGBT events but I generally don't talk about my sexuality because there isn't any less judgement there I'm afraid. Especially as I'm currently in a monogamous longterm relationship with a man. The video just made me wanna hug her, it made me feel all kinds of happy. Been a longtime subscriber of her and it's just really nice to see this conversation taking place."

bisexual,3duj6j,hbonnie,3,Sun Jul 19 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't come out to others until you're sure yourself how you identify. I can't really tell you what you are, but if you are attracted to woman and enjoyed the sex then I doubt you are straight. Try the Kinsey scale and see where you lie. It may help you to see it more concrete. Bisexuality is a spectrum and you could just be more attracted to men but still also attracted to women. Good Luck!"

Just continue to explore if you want. If it turns out that bisexuality isn't for you,then that's perfectly fine. Who knows? You may end up pansexual, or something else! :)"
bisexual,3duj6j,bleachblondebabe,2,Sun Jul 19 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Hi, 21 yo bi male here. I agree on the fact that you should wait to come out, until you're sure about how you feel. Only once that is clear I would worry about coming out. About that: I don't know your relationship with your friends, but from my experience I can tell you: don't underestimate your friends. I started coming out to my closest friends this year. I was really sceptical about coming out to one of my best friends, who is kinda close minded. Had to come out twice to him because the first time he didn't believe me. But in the end he was supportive, even though he struggles to understand how I ""became"" bi (as he likes to say), since I have dated girls my entire life. And another thing, don't let labels put to much pressure on you. Putting a label on something so personal like sexual orientation may often feel a little oppressing. It does not matter what you call yourself, if you're bi or whatever. What's important is what you like, and knowing what you like. Then if you are comfortable calling that with a name, like bi or whatever else, go for it. If not it's really not important to how you feel. It just might get a little more verbose to explain to people when talking!"
bisexual,3duj6j,BrokenDesires,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"I have known that I have a certain attraction to women for years but decided not to define my sexuality to other people.  Honestly now it seems to be very acceptable to not force a label on yourself, and besides finding community it doesn't seem necessary either.  Having a different kind of attraction to women than you have to men isn't out of the ordinary.  I had sex with a girl very recently and wondered the same thing... realized that it was something I wanted to do and not let any qualms about it define my identity.  If you need someone to talk to don't be afraid to reach out to me :)"

bisexual,3dtxc6,Unicorn_Tea_Party,6,Sun Jul 19 12:50:06 2015 UTC,"Please, take everything I say with a grain of salt, because this is definitely not my area of expertise.  The thing about pansexual vs. bisexual is that pansexual essentially just means gender/sexual identity doesn't matter to you.  You don't really go with the whole binary gender thing; as in, there's not just girls and guys, end of story.  However, bisexual usually implies that you do stick to the notion of just girls and guys.  It doesn't mean that you can't date a transwoman or anything like that; it just means the way you identify her is different based on whatever your outlook is.  ( I hope I did this justice, and if not, please tell me; sexuality is not something I'm incredibly familiar with, though I'd love to be.)  As for being afraid of being told you're not a real lesbian, or that you're seeking attention, sadly you're probably going to get that if you are anything but straight.  I had a girlfriend of seven years who I was going to marry who said that I wasn't actually bisexual, and that I was just really horny.  That kind of dismissal can come from anywhere, sadly."
bisexual,3dtxc6,sophus00,4,Sun Jul 19 12:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hello :) I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I consider myself pansexual because at the end of the day I like all brain/genital combinations. I am potentially attracted to any human, and I find something to like about every aforementioned combination. I love cis people, trans, and any degree of androgyny on the spectrum.   OP, if there's one thing I've learned it's that you can't get hung up on labels and splitting hairs, even as everyone's waving their pride flags. If you feel a connection with someone and you want to pursue it, let that be the end of the debate in your mind. Do what makes you happy."
bisexual,3dtxc6,Unicorn_Tea_Party,3,Sun Jul 19 13:34:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, I have a bit more understanding of it now.  That's what I understood pansexuality to be at it's core; sort of a ""I don't care what you are"" sort of mentality, because as you said, you're able to be attracted to any person.   If you feel a connection with someone and you want to pursue it, let that be the end of the debate in your mind.   Couldn't have said that any better."
bisexual,3dtxc6,Unicorn_Tea_Party,3,Sun Jul 19 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"""If you feel a connection with someone and you want to pursue it, let that be the end of the debate in your mind.""   That's a fucking good point. Excuse my language. :)"
bisexual,3dtxc6,ou_tis,3,Sun Jul 19 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding. I've wondered about whether or not I'm actually pansexual for a while. What matters to me more than anything is if someone has a good sense of humor. I tend to have a sarcastic sense of humor. I've met people of various genders who have the same sense of humor as I do. I've dated women online, and I've chatted with a few in person at college. Sexuality can be a pretty confusing and exhausting subject to discuss. But thanks again for the reply. :)"
bisexual,3duaje,megatron1812,4,Sun Jul 19 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"There’s a possibility that your more wrapped around the axel of your preferences than your sexuality.  All of us have preferences towards different appearances. For example, butch or fem, blond or brunette, skinny or built, etc… . Your “sexuality” (at least in my opinion) lies a bit more centered in the plumbing underneath. Are you excited by the thought of being up-close/personal with both males and females and all of the extremities that come with? If you answer yes to that (and don’t feel compelled to answer me here), that could be a good clue you’ve found the right neighborhood in this sub. If you prefer that they are of a masculine persuasion, I feel that’s more of a preference.      TBP"
bisexual,3duaje,typeBpositive,2,Sun Jul 19 16:28:28 2015 UTC,I'd look up pictures of masculine or androgynous women and see if you find yourself sexually attracted to anything you find. That may help you to figure out if you're bisexual or heterosexual.
bisexual,3duaje,amethyst_specter,2,Sun Jul 19 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"so let's say I am attracted to their appearance, then what?"
bisexual,3duaje,amethyst_specter,2,Sun Jul 19 16:05:12 2015 UTC,Then I'd consider you bisexual unless it's something so androgynous to where you'd think it was a guy if you didn't search for it. I'm a guy who only likes feminine looking guys but they don't need to fool me into thinking they're girls so I consider myself bisexual.
bisexual,3duaje,youre_a_poozer,2,Sun Jul 19 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"Have you ever pursued a relationship with a female crush? You may feel more into the idea of the sex part of the relationship once you are romantically involved. It may be something where you aren't the kind of person to just hook up with random people but more of a person that requires a real connection. Also, I know you're looking for a label, but do know that you don't have to have one. Just be you and date and kiss and sex up ;) whoever you are into and try not to worry too much about what it all means. You'll figure out what you like."

bisexual,3duaje,mypussytastelikecola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:29:53 2015 UTC,I've never been asked and I'm 37. You only need to explain to a person if you're dating them. If someone else asks I'd just say I like a little bit of everything or I'm open to all types of relationships or it's complicated. Most likely if someone asks it's because they want to date you or are trying to see if it's something you'd be open to and in that case you can answer according to how you feel about them.

So the whole thing is of course a bit scary for him. I have two kids and was married before. So of course I'm scared as well! But, after 3 years and lots of strong communication we think we are ready for this! so..... sorry for the long story. We were talking about how it is important to keep the communication, trust,honesty, and to be faithful. Then I had a though, and told him. I said it is going to be kind of sad to think I will never get to have sex with a woman again. Of course he makes jokes about how if I get a girlfriend then he can do this and that. I and  told him as much as finding a woman would be fun it just makes things complicated. Been there done that. And then you start having trust issues.

If I find love, and if that love is the same gender as me, then everyone else will just have to deal with it. Until then ima keep being me. If there's any advice I can give, you have to be at peace with yourself, (I think that maybe deep down you might think that being bi is not okay, it is) like you said sexuality doesn't define you, so dont let it.

Recently after reading all the comments in this sub where men say they wear panties and seeing some F/F porn where the woman was wearing briefs, I bought some women's boyfriend breifs. They're colors like red with white trim and cut for a woman's body so cuter than tighty whities lol. I'm not sure how sexy my straight husband finds them, but they're more for me and I have tons of traditionally sexy women's underwear to wear for him ;). I guess my point is, I feel really aroused when I wear them. My attraction to women is a secret from most and wearing the breifs under my regular clothes feels the same. It's just for me."

bisexual,3dt97r,youre_a_poozer,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:20 2015 UTC,I can totally see that from your point of view. I have always been a tomboy and never been super girly so I found the term to be off putting for me personally. I could see how it would be more sexy to use from other people's point of view though. I am still not very feminine and prefer a slightly masculine while still clearly female look.
bisexual,3dt97r,youre_a_poozer,2,Sun Jul 19 16:46:54 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense. I'm just the polar opposite. The only reason I would caution you from using terms like ""women's underwear"" is that it implies it's not for men. While true, the designer didn't have a man in mind for most panties, a designer likewise didn't have women in mind when making blue jeans until recently. It just confirms gender norms that make little things in life, like people such as me that would be happier if I was judged based off my underwear of choice, more difficult to overcome socially. (That isn't to say that I think you were judging me, but many people would openly do so.)"

bisexual,3drxzb,tryune,4,Sat Jul 18 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"Have you flirted at all with them? I'd say it's the best way to feel it out. If they flirt back and aren't put off by you flirting with them, being that they are already in a relationship, then I'd stick with that for awhile. When you're sure the attraction is mutual you could kind of float the idea or ask a ""hypothetical"" question about their thoughts on open relationship."
bisexual,3drxzb,youre_a_poozer,2,Sat Jul 18 22:26:23 2015 UTC,Absolutely love this idea. Thanks for the insight!
bisexual,3drxzb,avapoet,3,Sun Jul 19 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, came here to say basically the same thing as /u/youre_a_poozer:  ""So - quick question, and feel free to say 'none of your business' if I'm being too nosy: but are you two strictly monogamous?""  I'm a big fan of asking what I actually want to know (but without being offensive or impolite by hitting on somebody who really wouldn't appreciate it: some tact is good, too). That opening question gives you all the flirting-permission you need. Next, assuming you get anything other than a cold shoulder or a firm ""yeah, we're monogamous"", all you need is ""How would you feel about the three of us fooling around sometime?"" Then give them space to think about it: couples sometimes like to talk privately before inviting a third into their bed!  Good luck!"
bisexual,3dsi7i,Ian47,10,Sun Jul 19 01:01:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, depending on how you think it, does it really matter?  The end result was the same, it's not like you're not officially ""part of the club"" ordon'tgetthecooljacketsweallhave   Seriously, though, I think regardless of how you got to where you are, if it's what makes you yourself, then it doesn't matter.  It's what you want, then more power to you for attaining it.    I, for one, don't care how or why you're bi.  I really don't care what you are at all, because you're you, and that's the best thing you could be."

bisexual,3dsi7i,Broaway9993,5,Tue Jul 21 11:45:48 2015 UTC,"But to this day i dont know if I was always going to be bi or if I consciously shifted the course of my sexual development.   As other people have noted, maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but it doesn't matter. However...you can do this. Sexuality is not nearly a set in stone as people like to pretend it is. Situational sexual behaviours arise in populations that are atypical of the general population (prisons, all-boys schools, all-girls schools, etc). Also, nurture is a huge add on to our sexuality. Nature took care of part of the deal, but nurture and how we interact with the world around us has a huge part in shaping our sexual identity, both our orientation, our sexual role, our kinks and fetishes, the very way we look at sex, it's all a constant low-hum of feedback from the environment around us. So, if you did consciously shift the course of your sexuality, all you did was have a pre-determined sexual orientation that was open to exploration and feedback of that kind. You didn't do anything wrong, and in fact cases like yours would be an interesting case study, since we still know comparatively little about how our brains react to sexual thoughts and compulsions. We know a lot about how our physical bodies react, but researchers are still divided on something as base as where fetishes come from."
bisexual,3dsi7i,TheLonelySamurai,2,Sun Jul 19 15:31:05 2015 UTC,sexuality is fluid and can change so its not necessarily something you did at all
bisexual,3dsi7i,TheTristanator1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't actually matter either way, because people should have the choice, regardless.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing your sexuality.  But with all the time and effort you spent thinking about it, to me it sounds more like you pretended to yourself that you  didn't feel attraction, until you finally accepted it."
bisexual,3dt8ge,confusedaboutcock,2,Sun Jul 19 05:54:01 2015 UTC,"This is really similar to how I feel about women (I'm female). Purely sexual attraction, no interest in dating just sex. Can't quite differentiate between only wanting a sexual relationship because I'm not romantically attracted to women, or only wanting a sexual relationship because of social stigma and my own bi-phobia. Like what you're saying about it plaguing you - what if I mess around, decide it's not my deal, but then still have to put up with the unfortunate side effects of our shitty society's non-hetero-phobia? Your identity is your own to define, but if it helps, I finally just said fuck it, I'm going with bi. It's only a label, and I don't fit neatly into any of the given boxes. I do also want to experiment - used to be kind of obsessed with ""needing to"" although mostly any more i feel like screw that, I knew I wanted to bone dudes before I ever even kissed a boy and experimenting is just trying to prove something to myself. That I don't need to prove. But hey, if I want to, I'm allowed to experiment however I want to experiment (in a consensual way of course), I'm allowed to change and grow, and if I have sexytimes with ladies now and later I decide I don't want to, then that's 1000% fine and anyone who can't wrap their head around it can go fall in a well. I don't even have to come out if I don't feel like it. The only thing about it that might plague me are my own prejudices and I need to face those sooner or later anyways."
bisexual,3dt8ge,sweetbuttons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think that's a really good point, where it could be my own prejudices confusing me. I'm Australian, grew up in a very conservative area and come from a very conservative family. I've since moved, and have never shared my family's conservative views. But it's pretty ingrained. Thank you for taking the time to share your story, I really appreciate it."
bisexual,3dt8ge,sweetbuttons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:39:09 2015 UTC,"No problem. My family isn't even conservative like yours, in fact my sister is gay and my parents are heavily involved in PFLAG, but still if I think about it, about how it makes me feel if I imagine myself dating a lady, there's no denying that dealing with coming out and ""explaining"" and facing the world's bi-phobia really makes me cringe. Many of my friends and family wouldn't even flinch, but for example in the state where I work I could be legally fired for ""condoning a homosexual lifestyle"". Probably would never happen, I know plenty of LGBT people employed where I am, but makes my stomach turn. Sneakily experimenting doesn't carry that burden. But I'm in a very happy hereto relationship right now, with an amazing guy who is also fluid and not only open to experimenting but encourages it! Now if only we could find the kinda people you're talking about. Safe, clean, trustworthy, and totally dtf...haha. Fingers crossed for you dude. You'll figure it out. :)"
bisexual,3dt8ge,Goodlfe210,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way as you guys. I'm 21 and starting to try and accept that I have a an attraction for other men and it's purely sexual. I'm only interested in being romantically involved with women, but I occasionally find other masculine sexy. I don't feel as if I'd ever come out to my conservative family. I'm black and in the black community homophobia is extremely high. Since its only sexual I don't feel it's necessary information for me to divulge to anyone in my inner circle. If I wanted to ever have a relationship with another man I would feel it more necessary to come out but my attraction to men is only out of arousal. I'm attracted to sexy people male, female, and even transgendered."
bisexual,3dt8ge,sweetbuttons,2,Sun Jul 19 12:27:24 2015 UTC,"*Transgender is the pc term, no ""ed"" at the end. Just so ya know :) I feel the same way about coming out. It seems like as long as it's purely sexual then coming out is the same difference as telling someone about a kink I have. But I did tell my closest friends and my gay sister, because it's helpful to have people to talk to. For example at pride with my sister I heard someone going off on that same old bull about ""bi people are so selfish, why can't they just pick a gender!"" And it was nice to be able to tell my sister how furious that made me. Or even watching a movie, it's nice to be able to admit to my buddies when I find a lady attractive. Not necessary, but nice. Also nice to tell my boyfriend, fun how that plays out, haha."
bisexual,3dt8ge,Goodlfe210,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"You described it perfectly I feel like my attraction to other men is only out sexual desire and not an emotional connection with men. I find masculine men very sexy but with women it different. It's hard to explain but I like a girl it's not just about looks. I like to be around women and get to know more about them and build real relationships. As for men I usually see a big muscular guy and I'm like he's hot, I'd let him fuck me. There's no desire to know the person just fuck em."

bisexual,3dt8ge,youre_a_poozer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:52 2015 UTC,"I've experimented 1 time with a guy and I actually didn't really enjoy it. Masculinity is what attracts me to other men. I am 100 masculine, with girls I love the dominant role but with another male I'd like to try the submissive role in bed. I'm not into bdsm or anything but I'd like to be dominated to a certain extent. I want a guy to take control but not beat me up while fucking. I want a guy who slaps ass while fucking,pulls me around and positions me how he wants me, choke me while im laying on my back and taking it and dirty talks about how good it feels but whose also passionate at the same time. A guy whose into foreplay and making out while having a good fuck session.  Anyways the guy I met through a craigslist add was nothing like what I just described, even though he claimed to be. His dick was small and skinny. He'd sent a pic of a dick which looked like his but in person was way smaller. I wanted to give another man a nice long blowjob before getting fucked but he said he didn't care for bjs (WTF). He wanted to get right to the sex. It didn't last long at all maybe 12 min in 1 position  (zzzzz). I could tell he was pumping but I couldn't really feel much. He also asked to take the condom off multiple times after I thought I'd made it clear that I was only will to play safe.  So I don't think I enjoyed it mainly because I wasn't turned on by the partner I choose. I'm still interested in hooking up with men but it's hard to find someone I actually like because I'm on the dl. The guys that I find that do most of my preferences are either only looking for raw sex, physically unattractive, or way too far away."

I can tell you from my experience that you thinking someone is cute or pretty does not mean everyone does and it doesn't make you a douche for liking pretty/cute girls because it's just what you like. In my mind what would make you a douche is if you look at a someone and judge them because of they're body/looks and not for who they are as a whole or if you don't even give someone a chance just because they aren't your type.

My husband and I did decide to open our relationship so I could try to find a woman to have a relationship like that with, but it's proving harder than I thought it'd be (though I knew it wouldn't be ""easy"").  Closer to what you're saying though, I do find my attractions to be pretty fluid. There were a few years when I hardly even though about women, then the attraction came back with a vengeance, and now I rarely find myself attracted to men other than my husband.   Regardless, the only thing that indicates whether you are bi, gay, or something else is what you feel in your heart. Identity can only come from within.

You're under no obligation to come out to anyone you're not intimate with, let alone people like this, even if they are your parents.  Your are legitimately scared to tell someone who birthed you and took complete care of you for years about a core facet of yourself.  That speaks volumes.   Add that to the fact that you're currently living with them, and you have one nasty situation.   I know it's tough, wanting to tell but having fear of being reprimanded.  I'm going through the same thing.     As for your father, I think you should seriously consider coming out to him.   It'd take a huge load off your shoulders and you're already pretty sure that he won't mind much.   Taking the plunge might be worth it there.   That being said, I'm glad you have such a wonderful fiance, and I hope you keep that wonderful man close.  It's difficult finding someone who accepts you for who you are.

But yeah, when i'm at home, I have to like, pretend to agree with all of their homophobic shit. I usually just walk away or don't say anything. Or I play devil's advocate by going ""not that its right or wrong or anything, but people on the internet say ____"" which gets me out of trouble while still giving my point of view...   I'll probably tell my mom once I'm married.... idk. It's just a mixture of guilt and fear."

Having to pretend to agree with things or at least not give them a passing glance is the worst.  In fact, I've had to do it before, and now that I'm ready to come out, I'm waiting for one of those moments so that I can really flip the conversation on them by making it about me.    But, as I said, I understand the guilt and fear, and it really sucks that you have to feel guilty and fearful of something that really defines you."
bisexual,3dre5c,ccellofleming,2,Sun Jul 19 12:37:05 2015 UTC,"Your story is similar to mine. I have been married to a man for 6 years (been together for 10) so to the outside world, I'm straight. I, too, was confused about whether I should ever bother coming out as Bi when for all intents and purposes, it didn't ""matter"".    My husband was the first to know. He has always supported me, and similar to you he told me that if I want to date women, that's fine. Then I branched out to a couple close friends that I trusted. It helped that one was lesbian, and one was bi, so the conversation opening was always sort of there.  The next step came about a year and a half ago when I actually started dating a woman. Before then I never really felt I was hiding anything from people by not telling them I was Bi, but it felt weird to try to hide someone I was dating. So I told my mom, because her and I are very close. Although she had worries about the relationship affecting my marriage, she was very supportive, and completely non-judgmental. I followed by telling my brother because, again, I knew he would not care, and would support me. However, I will never ever ever tell my dad. He is extremely conservative, born again Christian with completely different lifestyle and views from me. Absolutely nothing good would come from me telling him.   So I guess all that to say, you don't have to do anything you don't want to. If you decide to come out, great, if not, that's fine too. I think it's a very personal preference."
bisexual,3dre5c,youre_a_poozer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:39:57 2015 UTC,"For me, I came out to about 5 friends in 10th grade. Four of them were awesome. One, my boyfriend (now ex) told me it was weird and said i was gonna cheat on him with a girl and freaked out and we ultimately ended up ending things obviously. But because of his reaction, I kept it hidden for YEARS. Even from people I knew were bi/gay.   I just kinda hinted that I'm unopposed to threesomes, but I wouldn't say out loud that I'm bi.   I started to be comfortable saying it right before my fiance proposed. He was the first one I re-came out to. Then I stopped ""coming out"" and I just let people know if it came up. It was very much a ""need to know"" basis...  But recently idk... I feel like I'm hiding part of myself. I never understood the appeal of coming out but now I'm starting to. I can see how liberated I would feel if people knew.   I'll probably tell my sister and my dad... then once i'm married and out tell my mom... dont plan on telling my stepdad. He and I aren't close at all as it is..."
bisexual,3dre5c,youre_a_poozer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:42 2015 UTC,"Short answer...come out to your half sister first. This seems obvious to me. Doesn't even really matter how close you are. It's a good starting point for you. Practice so to speak  ;) You know she is at the very least open to non-straight relationships. She can be an ally for you when it's time to tell Dad.  Long answer...as much as you may want to be honest, these aren't the type of people to tell especially while you live with them. If it goes well with the sister tell your dad. That may be all you need to tell. I told my bi brother. It went amazingly well, but I knew it would. I thought I'd also tell my grandma who's a huge LGBT supporter & we are really close. I told her and it went fine, she was great. But I was left feeling like why did I even tell her. I kinda feel weird about it. I'm 37(f) married & monogamous (my husband's always known) so I felt like telling people was just like me being like ""here's what I fantasize about"", not that I said that lol. It felt weird. Idk I guess what I'm saying is that maybe after telling a couple of people who you know will be ok with it you might feel differently about telling your mom or anyone else for that matter. Also, if you tell your mom WAIT! Wait until you don't live there and it'll definitely be easier on all involved."

For instance, some of the hottest dudes I can think of don't come from actual gay animes. (Why yes, I will totally bang you Makoto and Haru Too bad they're already totally gay for one another.)  Now...gay manga? You might have better luck. If you want to avoid all the stereotypical pretty boy waif type characters you find in yaoi, I suggest trying out some of Mentaiko Itto's works. He's got an incredible art style, and his sex scenes are always scorching, with a lazy sensuality that really appeals to me. You can see what I mean with this NSFW pic here. His work is considered ""bara"", but he's more like ""bara lite"". If you want recommendations for more like that, I suggest asking /r/Bara for some more ""light"" bara artists.

I wonder a little if what you first learn to get off to is like a sign post on what you'll like, porn-wise.   I discovered my gay side around when I discovered sexuality in puberty (and about a year before we got our first dial-up modem)... Couldn't really tell anyone at that age back then so porn was how I could explore it. Didn't watch much straight porn cause I got enough exploration with friends haha.   But, professional porn on both sides is usually pretty cringe-worthy. I generally only like properly amateur stuff, but don't sweat it if you don't get up to it."

Certainly the type of porn you get off to is a real early indicator of your sexuality, but not all the time. But it's a little harder to determine if you watched straight porn like I did.  Then again, I realized my like of dicks only recently myself. And learned to accept it even more recently.  Though I have to agree that I can't stand to watch professional porn. It's too long, too produced, and just isn't as...real as amateur stuff. Besides, most amateur porn is free anyways and far more satisfying."

Nothing wrong with the latter, but I would suggest looking for bi porn with actual bi actors or actresses. You can just tell when it's only acting versus acting and fun. I'd say this applies to all porn - some people just seem like they're genuinely having fun while filming it (even if they are overacting a bit on top of it)."

bisexual,3dozbv,Munrowon,2,Sat Jul 18 02:07:37 2015 UTC,Did you doubt yourself before that?
bisexual,3dozbv,Munrowon,2,Sat Jul 18 02:18:04 2015 UTC,"Oh god yes;   I spent the better part of the year before I admitted it to myself questioning my interests. My thought process until that point hadn't even considered bisexuality; IE: I'm a guy -> I like girls -> Therefore I'm straight. It took a lot of downtime a self-reflection to acknowledge that I liked a lot more than just women.    The night I finally confirmed it wasn't even planned; I just got really, really drunk with a guy friend and admitted it. He turned out to be bi bi as well; something I hadn't realized before hand. We went far enough physically that I had my confirmation."
bisexual,3dozbv,Munrowon,2,Sat Jul 18 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"Lucky you had a friend in the same boat as you then :) If you don't mind me asking, do you feel differently between men and women? I can tell pretty early if I like a guy and if I want to flirt with him, even if I'm not very sexually attracted to him - whereas I mainly just feel a sort of.. raw sexual attraction toward sexy women, and less of an overall attraction to them. Does that make sense?"
bisexual,3dozbv,Munrowon,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"No question I lucked out; it's only upon reflection and reading other people story's have a realized how lucky I was. To your question my specific attraction to various sexes is something I've struggled a bit to understand myself; much less articulate properly to others.   The best I description I can offer is that I tend to relate on interest/emotional level more frequently to other guys. That's not to say I haven't found women I can relate to, but it tends to be rarer. Also the longest-running (and most romantic? maybe?) attractions I had were to men (generally unrequited unfortunately).      When it comes to physical attraction (and general masturbation fantasies) I more frequently favour women; although it sometimes changes as frequently as the weather."
bisexual,3dozbv,Munrowon,2,Sat Jul 18 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! Think this may have helped a bit in making me understand myself more. I don't have any bisexual friends (that I'm close to and know about), so generally I feel like the view I always get are either from straight or gay perspectives. Maybe that's contributing to this insecurity. Maybe it's more straight cut for them? Anyway, thank you for your insights :)"
bisexual,3doxfu,trashcan68696,6,Sat Jul 18 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"My first experience with a guy was in the 9th grade. I'd had a few girlfriends before then but this was something intriguing to me, though I'd never admit it then. I didn't lose my virginity to a girl until a few months later.       One night I was at a friend's house, doing what we usually did; play music, burn stuff, play video games, this and that. At some point we decided to raid his parent's liquor cabinet, which is as cliche as it gets. About an hour or two later he decides he's horny and just has to watch some porn. So I decide I could go for some too. We devise this plan to build this wall between us so boundaries aren't crossed.       So we take this amp cabinet panel and place it between us and throw some covers over it. Both of us can see the monitor we had the porn on and we start going at it. At some point in the porn, to our surprise, one guy starts stroking another. It doesn't phase either of us and we keep going. Eventually, I decided to reach over across the panel and start stroking him with some lube and he immediately gives in, leaning back in his seat and thoroughly enjoying himself. His dick is long, soft and uncut and so very thick. After about 5 minutes he pushes the barrier away in between us and gets on his knees and starts sucking me. After a good 5 minutes I pull him up and start stroking and sucking him as best as I can (I'm still inexperienced at this point) until he shoots his hot cum all over me. I'm hooked after this. He then pushes me on the bed and begins to stroke me with long and tight strokes until I can't take it anymore and I shoot so much cum out, all over my stomach. He then proceeds to lick it all off.       We go to the bathroom and clean ourselves off and carry out with the rest of the night, not saying a word about it. This happened a few more times until he moved a way a year or two later. Still one of my most nostalgic memories and makes me rock hard to this day."
bisexual,3doxfu,LinThizzy66,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:11 2015 UTC,"I can't completely answer your question since I haven't gone beyond oral, but I've gotten to similar levels on intimacy with both genders so it may help.  My first romantic relationship (although I wasn't ready to acknowledge at the time) was with a guy. It ultimately turned out to be unrequited, and only recognizable after the fact.     My first sexual experience was with a woman; it was typically hormonal and alcohol-fueled with little thought put into a long-term relationship. It was memorable; if not completely satisfying.   My first was experience with a man came years later (similarly alcohol fueled) but with more for thought put into the lead up. It was undeniably awkward, but served satisfactorily as a confirmation of my bisexuality.       So depending on whether your referring to romance or sexual things they came with different genders first for me."
bisexual,3doxfu,Munrowon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, If this helps. My first sexual experience was technically at 11/12 but I don't really count it because it was pretty much just fondling, with another boy. My first sexual experience with a woman was when I was 16, I then lost my virginity to another girl the year after. I was pretty insecure about my sexuality at that point though, Because of how we're raised with black & white notions and whatever. But I got over it and I admitted to myself I was Bisexual. I didn't have my first sexual experience with another man until I was 21 (I'm 24 now). It was pretty much a confirmation of my sexuality. I was on vacation on a cruise, One night I was hanging out with a bunch of people and got pretty drunk. People started to go to bed, and few of us remained late at night. It was pretty much me , 2 other guys and one girl. The girl was engaged so I didn't try to pursue her (though one of the other guys did try). I was pretty wasted at this point, as was this other guy I had just met, we left the other guy try to hit on the engaged girl  (with no results, as expected). Anyways, it's 4 am at this point and we're standing by the railing of the boat, talking gibberish. When these two gay guys (they were a married couple) commented on how we made a nice couple. It was awkward because that wasn't the case at all. After they left, we kinda joked about it like ""uhh naw...haha"". Until he said he didn't see a problem with that idea, I agreed and said that there was nothing wrong with that. awkward pause He then asked me if I wanted to fancy the idea and try for one night what it would be like, And I had not objections. Went to one of the public restrooms, entered the stalls. He goes down on me, it feels like he's done this before even though he denies it. I go down on him (first time doing oral on a guy). We both came, left a huge mess in the stall. We fooled around a couple of more times, I tried topping him, It was awkward and didn't really feel so good for either of us (bathroom stalls aren't comfortable I assume). Finished cruise, and went home, never saw him again. That's it. Oh and to this point I've still haven't kissed a guy, which is an odd thought considering.  Hopes this helps? It's fun to try new things, Like being sexually awakened again I guess. I am openly Bisexual now with close friends, so it helped by making me feel more confident about my sexuality."

bisexual,3do87k,Threw-away9999,6,Fri Jul 17 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"It has to do with you overthinking things and wanting to identify a particular way rather than being yourself, living your life, and coming to a determination through experience. Don't worry about labels and be attracted to whomever you find attractive. Go out with who you want to and eventually you'll figure things out. I was 18 when I started desiring other men and it wasnt until I was 22 that I came to the conclusion that I bisexual. Life is short, live it and dont worry about labels. Eventually you'll figure it out, dont rush it."

bisexual,3do87k,BeesorBees,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be 50/50 (or even only be attracted to people w/binary genders!) in order to be bi. And you don't necessarily need to label it either, although it can help to feel less alone. If you've had sexual fantasies about more than one gender, then it's up to you how you define that sexual attraction."
bisexual,3dmes6,Raeginglamb,5,Fri Jul 17 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"Although Cara herself says in NYT that she didn't find the Vogue article to be malicious, it's really a shame that when a bisexual talks openly and sincerely about their attraction to both genders, things like this can happen. I'm really surprised that multiple editors looked at this article and didn't see anything offensive about how the interviewer handled her sexuality."
bisexual,3dmw1p,artichokess,8,Fri Jul 17 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with a lot of what you said, just because someone doesn't know everything and actually doesn't want to inflict harm, doesn't mean they can't do harm. People can inflict harm just by going by stereotypes, because it takes away the human aspect of the group. That person might not know they're doing it, and might have no ill will towards that person, but it doesn't mean they didn't hurt anyone.  I'm still hurt by people being stupid or ignorant, even if they don't mean to be that way."
bisexual,3dmw1p,whoopsidied,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"that's exactly what i said in the last sentence...   there's a difference between not understanding someone and being prejudice against them. both can be painful, but..."
bisexual,3dmw1p,SweetZoJe,2,Sat Jul 18 07:49:26 2015 UTC,"Yup. Particularly online it's easy to get caught up in an idealogical camp when dealing with such issues, which leads to anyone who doesn't align exactly with us being pushed away. (""fucking monosexuals, etc"")  I don't think anyone gets to choose not to be misunderstood or erased for some aspect of their life. But we all get a choice how to deal with it. We'd set the best example by just being cool as fuck."
bisexual,3dmw1p,bluedaem0n,3,Sat Jul 18 10:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  Would I expect a random person on the street to go ""OH GROSS GET IT AWAY"" when presented with a bisexual person? No.  Would I expect a random straight guy on the street to go ""Hurr durr threesome"" when presented with a bisexual woman? Kinda.  Would I expect the typical straight woman on OkCupid to have serious doubts about dating a man who lists his orientation as bisexual? Absolutely.  There is a lot of prejudice masquerading as 'common knowledge' about bisexuals, and I don't think it really matters why the misconceptions are perpetuated or what you call the driving force behind them. The problem isn't the misconceptions, it's that both straight and gay communities as a whole don't really care that they're perpetuating them.    The 'monosexual' communities are in general behind 'the rest of us' in terms of gender spectrums, and I'd argue a lot of our perceived biphobia isn't actually biphobia, but a strong aversion to 'men' who aren't 'masculine' and 'women' who aren't 'feminine'."
bisexual,3dmw1p,bluedaem0n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:58 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with someone not wanting to date anyone. There's definitively nothing wrong with people only wanting to date people typical of their gender.
bisexual,3dmw1p,bluedaem0n,5,Fri Jul 17 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't understand what point you're making. It's biphobic to not want to date someone solely because they use the bisexual label, and it's biphobic to 'gender-cast' someone based solely on their bisexuality. It's absolutely not biphobic to have a preference for one 'zone' of the gender spectrum.  That being said, I have yet to meet a single person who said they 'wouldn't date a bi guy' and thought 'oh, that's too bad, you're such a wonderful person.'"
bisexual,3dmw1p,BI19940657,3,Fri Jul 17 21:19:43 2015 UTC,Why is it biphobic not to want to date someone bisexual? People are allowed to have preferences.
bisexual,3dmw1p,cbrachyrhynchos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:23:18 2015 UTC,"'Someone bisexual' tells you literally nothing about the person besides their ability to be attracted to both men and women.    ""I don't date black women.""  ""Why? Never thought a black woman was hot?""  ""Nope, I know some really fine black women, I just don't date them.""  ""What the fuck? Why?""  ""I dunno, I just don't think they're dating material. I'm allowed to have preferences!""    Please tell me you're not going to defend that.  Replace 'black' with 'bisexual'.  ...now 'it's just a preference' is okay? What changed?"
bisexual,3dmw1p,cbrachyrhynchos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:25 2015 UTC,"i will absolutely defend that. what's the matter with not finding a certain culture appealing as a dating prospect? bi people are part of the lgbt culture, they have a certain set of issues that they deal with, and they are attracted to more than one gender - for some people, one of more of those things is a turn off, and there's absolutely nothing the matter with that as long as it doesn't involve hate."
bisexual,3dmpnk,bisexta,3,Fri Jul 17 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm no psychologist, but I'd guess your feelings of shame/grossed out-ness (and lack thereof, depending on the circumstances) originate from your perception of what society deems acceptable and not acceptable.   Humans are like sponges; we soak up all sorts of things around us, and we don't really get to choose what.   Even if you're perfectly okay with yourself (which is awesome by the way), a part of you might feel bad/gross/guilt because you know that those feelings are looked down upon in some places.   Case in point, my ex wasn't all too great about my bisexuality.   She accepted me for it (so she said), but oftentimes didn't want to know anything about it and even confided in my best friend that she thought it was a phase and that I just didn't know what I wanted.   I knew that being bi was okay, but I'd still get feelings of shame and disgust from time to time.   I think with some time, you'll start to lose those thoughts somewhat and they won't bother you anymore."
bisexual,3dmpnk,Unicorn_Tea_Party,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"You should be a psychologist haha. Thanks for that. The whole sponge thing makes alot of sense too, I guess somewhere in the back of my mind I just get turned off by the whole idea of being attracted to a man. I forgot to mention that I was raised and still being raised in a Mormon househole where I hear anti gay slur day in and day out. That's probably it."
bisexual,3dmpnk,diagoro1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit similar, minus the shame/disgust. I chalk it up to just being a part of our bisexuality. Not that it's inner turmoil or a fight between our dual selves. More like a fluctuating attraction. For myself, I'm more hetero-romantic and bi-sexual, and maybe once had anything near feelings for another guy (which was probably more a result of him bein very well equiped and rocking my world). But generally I will gravitate back and forth, based on my mood and whatever is going on with my life.  You're really young, and wont really figure yourself out in any meaningful way for at least a few years. Just take it slow, and don't beat yourself up over any of it."
bisexual,3dmpnk,Harry4a2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"Shit, I'm the same way. I've just had to accept that my interest will fluctuate day to day. And I'm working on the shame as well. Literally all I'm doing is, every time I feel guilty or gross or whatever, I shut my eyes and just tell myself ""you don't have to feel bad, you don't have to feel bad, you don't have to feel bad."" It's working surprisingly well. Just gotta drill it into your brain that it's ok!   Idk if that exact technique would work for many other people, but something as simple as that helped me accept my bisexuality and eventually helped me come out. Might be worth a shot!"

By then I was in a long term relationship with my current boyfriend. Most days I feel bisexual (and very attracted to my boyfriend) but sometimes I feel like im just into girls... I feel really bad because of my boyfriend but sometimes the thought of penis just makes me so dammed uncomfortable. :( I personally think it's because I didn't explore the girl - liking side of me enough.  Perhaps you're still not really sure about your sexuality? You're still young so I take it you haven't explored too much? I think that over time you'll become more comfortable with your sexually as you get to know yourself more. Good luck :)"

My first girlfriend was gay, and she didn't care at all that I also liked guys. My best friend is also gay, and she along with her girlfriend and friends, are all great.  I have had an awful experience with a gay girl, though. She was talking about her girlfriend, so I was excited to come out to her and talk about our queerness. The next thing I knew, she was slamming bisexuals, and cursing herself for 'trusting' one, while calling us liars. That was a fun experience.  With straight people, it's been mixed. I've gotten pretty bad experiences, with people flat out telling me they knew more about my sexuality than I did, and people who were loving and cool.  I also live in a privileged area, though, so that may explain a lot."
bisexual,3dl9h3,whoopsidied,3,Fri Jul 17 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing. I love the attitude from some gay people that bisexuals can't be trusted because we can't make up our mind or because we want to nail everything that moves or something along those lines. It really genuinely cracks me up now that I've learned how to not be put down by those opinions.  Also spot on about straight people knowing more about our sexuality as bisexuals than we do. If you don't understand, just force people into whatever box you imagine for them I guess!  Being bisexual has taught me to NEVER make a single assumption about somebody's lifestyle, sexual role, likes and dislikes, anything like that. It is genuinely sad when people believe that every single other person in the world exactly fits into one or two lifestyle templates that are correct in their mind."

In my experience gay people are very understanding of bi people and can't be compared at all to straight people. I am not in any way invalidating your experiences but I think it's a massive misstep to equate the way gay people treat us to the way straight people have treated us (and all queers) for centuries
bisexual,3dl9h3,namelessuser,3,Fri Jul 17 11:36:14 2015 UTC,"Huh. I live in the SF Bay Area and I haven't faced any sort of backlash for being bi. Not from gay guys or straight girls, so far.   Is this something you have experienced more from the younger crowd?  I moved here at age 27 so I may have missed out on some bullshit. Before that I wasn't really openly bi."
bisexual,3dl9h3,TheHatThatTalks,3,Fri Jul 17 12:11:20 2015 UTC,"Policing of bisexuality that I've experienced (e.g. ""You're just straight and pretending to be special"", ""I've only seen you with guys/girls so you must be straight/gay"") is more prevalent with straight people I know, but definitely more jarring coming from someone who is gay or lesbian  I think when it comes from people who are gay or lesbian, it comes from a place of defensiveness, that their identity is sacred to them and anyone who does it in a seemingly half-assed way (e.g. bisexual, doesn't ""look gay enough""/look butch) makes them feel like their space is being perturbed by people who don't belong there. Kind of like ""I worked hard to gain the rights that I have, and I don't want anyone to intrude on my identity"". It's understandable from what I've seen of it, but it doesn't make it less ugly and it certainly doesn't justify biphobia."

I've heard some gay acquaintances make the offhand remark that they don't think bisexuality is real, but I've also heard bi people say that they think everyone is secretly bi, so I think that's just a common type of projection of people's own feelings. I've never encountered any hostility though."
bisexual,3dl9h3,picklesitter,2,Fri Jul 17 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"I've had mixed experiences with both.   In the queer community, I've met mostly nice people. The one thing that IS super common is (lesbian) women who insult straight men, which is invariably frustrating because I actually really liked some of my past boyfriends. I usually just smile and move on with those people; none of my friends are like that.   As for the straight world, people tend to accept me but not really understand what I'm going through.   I think I've had a better experience because I'm trans, so people who aren't okay with that kind of take themselves out of my life. And the number of people who will accept a trans woman but not a bisexual woman is pretty low."

I've been pretty lucky, as most of my non-straight friends are either bi or pan, so they know what's up. I've been pretty lucky in the straight department too, since no one has really said anything stupid. I think it's mainly because even before I was officially out, I was pretty obvious and people just always assumed, so no one's ever had a reason to make me feel weird. One of my friends just recently came out as gay, and she and I had pretty similar experiences about coming out and what led up to it, and she seems pretty cool with people of all orientations. She has more of a ""we need to stick together"" mentality rather than ""uh, well, you like guys too so what do you know?"""

His marriage came to an end yeeears ago and he has a boyfriend now.  His daughter surprised us with a girlfriend some time ago and identified as lesbian for some time. She has a stable boyfriend now. Some friends told me that another cousin (20+ female and younger than me) apparently has experienced with males and females a lot of times and in public. I don't know how these three relatives identify themselves, but they are not straight apparently. Then, another cousin from my mother's side of the family (20+ male) isn't straight either, but I don't know much about his life or how he identifies. All this got me thinking that maybe, there is a genetic link or something like that (the way we all got raised is different so that's out of the equation).

In my experience, just saying, ""I like attractive people of whatever gender"" works to make people ""get it"" even if you have to repeat it a few times. You're welcome to share your feelings/experiences about specific people in your romantic life to elaborate, but you're not obligated to.  I actually think you can be ""super bi"" if you're biromantic as well as bisexual. I've even said I am ""bi as fuck"" because I could date, love, and marry a person of any gender with no slight leaning either way.   As to ""why is that?"" - welcome to being a bi woman, where you're only ""doing it for attention"" (belittling, wrong, and sexist to boot because the only reason you're kissing that girl is for male attention!). Bi men are often assumed to be gay, and bi women are assumed to be straight, but maybe down for threesomes. It's very frustrating."

bisexual,3dkyzc,TheHatThatTalks,4,Fri Jul 17 03:08:21 2015 UTC,"I think people also have to realize that our world is centered around straight people, and women especially usually have to go up against familial pressure to be with a man. That doesn't mean that bi people can't have happy opposite-gender relationships or that they're necessarily forced at all, but that the world generally coaxes bi women or makes it more socially easier to be with a man than a woman."

Since he's got a big role to play in that part of your life (presumably, anyway) and he's going to be your closest companion and partner for the rest of your life (hopefully!), it may be very important for you to have his support and acceptance.

bisexual,3djdc6,abyssinicum,2,Thu Jul 16 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the exact same way, and it only makes my problems worse.  I'm in similar shoes as you, except I'm not engaged yet (my boyfriend is going to propose soon, I just don't know when/how). A couple years ago I had my first crush on another girl, and I told him about it.  He laughed, not in an insulting way, but in a way that showed that he thinks my crush is adorable. I basically reverted to a shy teenager, and he thought that's the cutest thing. He liked seeing me that way, because I hadn't acted like that since he and I started seeing each other several years earlier.  I never did pursue the girl: She has a boyfriend, so I don't know if she's into girls or if she is in a nonmonogamous relationship. But I didn't want to put her in a weird position, so I kept my feelings from her. But this crush helped me eventually realize that I am in fact bi, and that my boyfriend is open to my exploring this side of my sexuality. Hell, he's fine with my dating other men, as long as it's within certain limits and with his knowledge.  So it ended up being really valuable for me to be open and honest with him. Now we're in a semi-open relationship. He knew that my crush had no way of competing against our relationship (even if I did end up dating her), and I had someone I can trust to talk about this with."

It's normal when you first start internally thinking of yourself as bi to go through a phase of hyperawareness about your attractions, where you ruminate about this quite heavily. It can seem like you're trapped on a rollercoaster and it may feel unpleasant. I promise, it'll calm down a bit and it'll all feel like another day at the office, in 6 months to a year.  I've found there are several different types of 'moods' I can get. I've actually categorized them and kept track of them. You may recognize some of these.  -Neutral, asexual - not horny, not interested in anything really.   -Bisexual, hypersexual - very very horny, males/females both turn me on heavily, in all ways. I feel like nothing can truly satisfy me when I'm in this state, and I tend to have the greatest interest in seeking out new experiences.  -Gay, sporadic - a brief, but extremely strong gay mood. ""Fuck, I need a dick right now this instant"". Goes away as soon as I masturbate to it/fuck a dude.  -Straight, sporadic, cis - a brief, but extremely strong straight mood. ""I just want to DOMINATE a woman. I want to show her what being dicked truly means"".  -Straight, sporadic, trans - a strong desire to become a woman. The attraction to women manifests as envy. Goes away as soon as I masturbate to it/get fucked by someone.  -Bi-leaning-Gay, persistent, sexual - a longer-lasting Kinsey 4.5-ish mood, usually lasting 2-3 weeks to a month. Sex drive is strong and I feel like I need to masturbate more (even in a relationship).   -Gay, persistent, asexual - a longer-lasting gay mood, again 2-3 weeks to a month. My sex drive lowers significantly and I don't masturbate much or feel horny. My opposite-sex attraction mostly hibernates during these. I only get this kind of mood when I'm in a relationship with a guy.  -Straight, persistent, sexual - a longer-lasting straight mood. 2-3 weeks to a month. Pretty much the same deal with my attraction to men hibernating, but these are always sexual moods. This usually happens when I'm dating a girl, but it can appear at other times occasionally."

I suppose what might fluctuate is whether I'm looking for physical attention or emotional support, which might push me one way or another, but not enough that I think my orientations have changed."

I do find that if I'm immersing myself in some kind of queer community (e.g. this subreddit!) my attractions seem to balance out more, probably because I start feeling more comfortable being attracted to people who aren't cis guys. :)"

Although I think the reason I freak out is because I originally thought I was just gay and then discovered I was bi afterwards. And you have to understand that, for me, just realizing I was gay was hard enough and something that I was in denial about for a long time. So whenever my sexuality drifts back to the predominantly gay side I start to worry that I'm sinking back into denial and that I've been lying to myself for years all over again. Not fun. =("

I liked the Flexuality test better: it's a bit more subtle, and measures more than just your interest in each gender.  (It splits out romantic vs. sexual attraction, and measures a few other things.)  It also understands that not everyone has had sexual experiences with both genders (shocking!). https://flexuality.wordpress.com/take-the-test/  Keep in mind, like any test, the results are still dependent on your own self assessment, so it can still be fooled if you're dead set on viewing yourself through a faulty lens.  It also doesn't seem to recognize the ace spectrum.  Oh, and they use the words ""polyamorous"" and ""flexamourous"" to refer to what most people would call biromanticism (the capacity to be emotionally interested in all genders); that confused me for a bit, lol."

I was honestly surprised at how intuitively it came (ba dum tss) to me. Basically, I just thought about the types of touch I have enjoyed from previous partners/myself and tried to do that. If that doesn't work out for you, just ask for some guidance! Good luck!"
bisexual,3dgekj,pennywhistlesolo,4,Thu Jul 16 04:36:27 2015 UTC,"Kind of echoing what the others have said--I also recently started seriously dating another woman (who primarily identifies as a lesbian) after a long stretch of just being with men. It can be hard, not just when you're unfamiliar with the landscape, but when you feel like you're up against all her other, maybe more experienced partners. Or that may just be my own anxiety, hah.  Anyway, yeah, the best thing you can do is tell her that you haven't really done this before, and make sure she's comfortable giving you some guidance (because some people aren't, and consent is hot, etc.) because you're into her and wanna make her feel good (which, again, is hot to hear). Just because you're working with similar parts doesn't automatically make you an expert, and I promise you that no one expects you to be one--let yourself make mistakes, play around with different things that you like or that she says she likes, and have fun. If you're especially worried, maybe go through some of the guides on r/sex, but don't try to do anything fancy your first time out."

And then from 8th grade, to now (just going into 12th) I've shifted from a 1 to a 5 on the Kinsey scale.   Looking back, I definitely did have some same sex crushes that I just didn't realize at the time. But even now that I can confidently say I'm like 95% for the same sex, I can't denounce my past 'hetero' crushes and relationships. They are a very real part of me. And there's no easy way to explain that to people. There's no way to explain that my past, and my present have equal legitmacy. And so it's hard for me to choose the one label over the other."
bisexual,3deu7k,GizmoMachine,10,Wed Jul 15 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but how do you identify now? I feel like I can really relate to this post. I have seriously been attracted to boys/men when I was a teen but now (as a 23 year old) since accepting my attraction to the same sex I have become like 90-95% attracted to the same sex and 5-10% attracted to opposite sex. I feel too gay to identify as bi and too bi to identify as gay and it's really distressing."
bisexual,3deu7k,raggedydoc,10,Wed Jul 15 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"I kind of avoid identifying, just so that I don't have to commit to a term. Sometimes people will use gay or lesbian in reference to me, and I don't ""correct"" them. Same for when they refer to me as bi. When I do have to refer to myself, I make it as casual as possible. Eg: ""well I'm a queer, so."" On the occasion that someone directly asks me if I'm gay I'll say ""something like that."" I've gotten pretty good at deflecting. Most people feel awkward enough when asking the first question that they won't press more. Lately homoflexible fits me best, but saying it out loud make me feel like the special flower type."

People say that labels don't matter, but I think if we gave everyone who was in that fuzzy borderline area something concrete to hang onto and define themselves with more confidence, they might feel a lot better than having to round up or down and deal with either limiting themselves to 1 or committing to put more effort into a gender than they have the appetite for. This may be another thread of mine."

He said he had no hangups, no qualms the whole time, and just followed where his fantasies took him, and that's where he ended up.  My own attractions have shifted as well, though not as dramatically as that. But I can see how I could end up somewhere completely different from where I am now in the vast amount of time my life affords, and although I intend to identify as bisexual regardless (for me, it's a political identity as well as a sexual one), I feel that if I were to change my mind about that as well, it wouldn't negate the many years that I was equally attracted to both sexes, or the decade before that that I was totally a ladies man."

bisexual,3deu7k,four2thefloor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"Great! Good luck with it!  But a point-of-order: don't say that you're ""reverse"" bicurious. Just like bisexual people who say that they're ""a bit gay"", defining ourselves in terms of the statistically-most-common sexuality is heteronormative and that undermines people's experience: people like you!  As you'll no-doubt appreciate, it can be hard to consider identifying as bisexual, but it can be even harder if you've previously identified as gay. Why is that? Because people assume that heterosexuality is the default position from which everybody 'starts' and then may or may not find their way elsewhere. But that's only the case because people say it's the case! It's only social conditioning that makes us see the straight majority as the norm from which we 'deviate', and that attitude makes it harder for people to come out as their actual identity. Just to pick a common example: you often hear people ask when people knew that they were gay (or bi!), but you never hear anybody ask when somebody knew that they were straight!  We can challenge these norms, and we can do so in a gentle way: by using language that befits the world we'd like to see. A world in which everybody is free to declare - or not declare - their sexuality to whomever they want and whenever they want, and not be defined by it any more than they define themselves, nor be ""locked in"" to it or else feel like their inconsistency is a character flaw if they later decide that their sexuality is different than what they announced previously (shocker: people change their minds; double-shocker: people change).  So I hereby declare you as bicurious, in my mind. There's no such thing as reverse-bicurious. Now go forth! Know thyself! Do whatever research you need to (either in your mind or out in the world) to determine what your bicuriosity means to you, and may it bring you happiness and joy, no matter what identity you define yourself by today, tomorrow, next year, or in thirty years time."

Our response to, 'bi now, gay later' can't be, 'it doesn't happen', because it does.  It would be quite rude, if someone ordered a panini and side salad at a cafe, for the waiter to loudly proclaim that he once knew someone who didn't eat the side salad, that he'll only bring the panini.  Further, it's important not to forget that people misreport their sexual orientation all the time. Many gays have claimed they're bi, but equally, many bisexuals have claimed they're gay.  If someone's in the closet, probably best to give them space to figure it out by themselves, m'kay."

The problem is not that people change their labels it's that other people will use that as an excuse to doubt someone's label.  Even if a significant percentage of people who carry the bi label end up dropping it, that does not justify a witch hunt, and the people who are subject to that witch hunt are very miserable having to endure that, regardless of whether they really are bi or not (or whether they are going to stay bi or not)."

However, I've known people who were bi at one time in their lives but now identify as exclusively gay or straight. I can't estimate how often it happens relative to just staying bi, but it's not rare.   I am agnostic about how much of this is biologically determined, versus learned behavior or just personal development. I am who I am and I love who I love. Explaining the causes is secondary to that fact. Even if the mouth-breathers are right and it's entirely a matter of personal choice (which I don't believe), that's still all right by me and I wouldn't change, and it's no reason to harass and persecute people.  I think of it like houses. Some people live their whole lives in the house they were born in, and others move around.

Im glad it didn't work out because I was in denial about my sexuality for years. I'm not now. I feel liberated. I'd like to date more women in the future but for right now im having fun! Ideally id like to meet a bisexual female. Im definitely more sexually attracted to women. At this point, im not sure if I can date a female who is straight. Bisexuality is only as complicated as you make it out to be. I'm just starting to realize that."

I guarantee that they'll give you some good tips!   I was always more afraid of approaching women than men for some reason...I think it's because when I've approached a lesbian woman, I wasn't taken seriously and seen as not someone they could consider dating long term. I've always had trouble finding bi girls. Best of luck!"

Sexually I feel almost exclusively dran towards men. I often develop crushes on men, I think their bodies and facial features are gorgeous, I get turned on by their deep voices, etc. But romantically I more or less only feel drawn towards women. I've only ever been in love with women and all relationships I tried to have with men ended more or less quickly because that romantical attraction wasn't there and I had a hard time connecting to them emotionally.   I've talked about this with some of my friends who are also bi and this seems to be kind of a common issue (romantical attraction towards one gender and sexual attraction towards the other)."
bisexual,3dh2gy,LeilaBluex,3,Thu Jul 16 10:10:15 2015 UTC,"I can relate. When I was younger, I only really felt a sexual attraction to girls, but could only really see myself in a romantic relationship with a guy. Eventually I did have romantic & sexual relationships with guys, and in the past few years my sexual attraction to men increased significantly, but only after being with guys for a number of years. May not be the same for you, just wanted to share my experience.  Also, open relationships and polyamory are things. If you think your preferences may persist and that worries you, it may be worth at least looking into and learning about those options. Maybe you'd be happiest with a wife and also being able to explore with guys on the side. It can be more difficult to find partners open to this but it's totally possible."

One thing I've learned is that what we watch in porn or enjoy as fantasies doesn't necessarily equal what we are in real life. I know quite a few straight girls who watch lesbian porn, but would never date or have sex with a girl because they're straight. I absolutely love reading about bloodplay, but I would probably pass out if I ever participated in it.   You're the only one who can really decide what you are. My advice is to not stress and take time to figure out more of what you do and don't like. Sexuality is complicated and confusing, so don't feel like you have to rush to figure everything out all at once."
bisexual,3dgod1,whoopsidied,2,Thu Jul 16 04:18:04 2015 UTC,its okay to not know right now you are still young. dont get to caught up in the name tags just yet and do what feels right to you. if you become attracted to a guy then proceed with the next step of the plan and ask him out. this also applies to the girls that you are attracted too. latter down the line when the lines become less blurred i would say that you should pick a side.  When i say pick a side not meaning that we are against each other. what im saying is that is when you will know what you are and then you should come out/ get your pride on lolz
bisexual,3dgod1,techn0path,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:32:55 2015 UTC,"The porn that someone likes doesn't always link to their sexual orientation.  Also, people can like two genders yet prefer one over the other, you don't have to like both men and women equally in order to be bisexual.  I have also been confused about my sexual orientation for a while (I knew I liked guys but wasn't sure about girls, I'm a girl) and have learnt that rushing to figure it out or stressing about it will not help, instead, don't worry too much about a label and do what feels right."
bisexual,3deu5e,rodarolla,2,Wed Jul 15 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"trying to categorise yourself can be worthwhile, but it's of limited use.  some people feel the need to have a label to try and call themselves something, or to name something they're struggling with (which makes it easier to face and deal with); and it can also help you find people with similar experiences to talk to, which can be helpful.       what i'll say is that you seem to have some intimacy issues beyond lack of interest, but you also have an interest in sex.  I'm probably a little biased (hence being here) but worrying about the sex or gender of people you are into doesnt look likely to help you to me, but I can't speak with much authority there.      my advice will be this - find someone to talk to about the intimacy.  To make your sexual fantasies real, what conditions do you need?  Are they about who your'e with re: gender?  Do they require a certain degree of connection (beyond your high school gfs?).  Finding out more about your own interest in sex will at least remove a variable and make it easier to answer other questions.  You can talk to close friends about this, or counsellors.  (Your Uni will probably have some counselling services, and if this is causing you distress or low mood, then it's worth talking to them)."
bisexual,3deu5e,uisge-beatha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:35:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I started seeing a counsellor for my SA but then it turned out I also had ADHD so we've been working on that for a while. My next appt isn't for 2 weeks but I really want to bring it up. Every day it just bothers me even more and I felt like if I didn't try something like posting here I might just lose it before the 2 weeks.  I'm occasionally concerned about the genders I'm into because where I live can be really homophobic, and even though I've always thought I thought of everyone the same no matter their orientation, my initial reaction to myself probably being gay was self-hate >_>.  I really like your second suggestion. I've really been thinking the same thing like I said.  I even keep saying if I break down enough I could go find a prostitute but, damn, even just thinking about it scares me lol. Thanks for the advice."

To me the whole concept of virginity is bullshit and you're being way too hard on yourself!    You're not in a worse position than you were before you fucked because you've learned something about yourself. When you meet the right person and make love to them it will still feel just as special. You can choose what significance to give the fuck!"

Your virginity? What is virginity and what does it even mean? In effect the main thing you've lost is the fantasy of your first time but to me you should have never had that fantasy in the first place!    If you feel like reading up on why there's even a concept of virginity/first time this page on Wikipedia is probably a good starting point, hopefully you'll also think it's a load of shit too :). Sex has the significance we choose to give it; sometimes a fuck is just a fuck that satisfies an animal craving and sometimes it's an expression of love. You surely talk and communicate all the time, does that diminish the words 'I love you' when you say, write, read or hear them?"

What about 80/20? So it's left up to a person's choice. If you don't feel like you're bi then use gay. Just because your attraction isn't exactly, strictly, only for people of your own gender doesn't mean you have to use bi. And if someone else insists that you are bi despite that then they are wrong."
bisexual,3dg4mv,ganderso,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"There's no clear dividing line between ""not entirely gay"" and bi. Is 90/10 not entirely gay? What about 80/20? So it's left up to a person's choice.    Yes, but the language we use is confusing- a person who is 90/10 can be both bisexual or gay- dependent on how they experience attraction, but nevertheless they fall under the 'bisexual umbrella' in either case.   My premise is that we need a different words for the umbrella meaning of bisexual, and for the actual bisexual orientation, because they are really distinct -it is not about numbers, and yet it gets treated as such.   I've had a lesbian woman insist to me that ""95% gay isbisexual - because this is  frequently the use of the term. When in reality it can mean bisexual, but it can also mean gay.   It's like calling all non-red and non-blue colours ""green""- it does not really make sense."
bisexual,3dg4mv,doombybbr,2,Thu Jul 16 08:53:49 2015 UTC,the use of the term is pretty much up to the individual.
bisexual,3dg4mv,sooneday,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:42 2015 UTC,I'd consider someone 90/10 not bi. I think the idea of a 100/0 person is a myth.
bisexual,3dg4mv,whoopsidied,6,Thu Jul 16 12:24:14 2015 UTC,Homo-flexible and hetero-flexible are words that could be used. Queer also.
bisexual,3dg4mv,LauraKy,3,Thu Jul 16 04:26:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe people outside of the bi-community or not very aware of the bi-community do this, but as someone very active in the bi-community I can assure you that we are very insistent on people defining themselves. We're totally cool when people prefer to call themselves bisexual rather than homo- or heteroflexible or the other way around. There are plenty of straight men for instance who hugely enjoy sucking a guys dick. I even read one guy who liked it immensely, but he didn't want to have to look at the guy he was doing because then it would be an immediate turn off. He also did not want to be touched or touch any other part, he just wanted to suck dick. I don't see any need to call these people bisexual if they don't want to. Fact is, sexuality is a spectrum. Hetero- and homosexuality is a spectrum too: they are not attracted to all the different sorts within their preferred gender either. Some men like girly women, other like very feminine women, others like ladylike women, yet again others like the more androgynous women. You could say that's a spectrum too. So if you're into androgynous women and there is ONE man that you come across that is so on the androgynous side that you are attracted to him, does that make you bisexual? Nah, that just shows that you are on a spectrum too. The thing we dó have an issue with is 'ugh, I don't need a label' because that is usually connected to biphobia: I'd rather not belong to a group at all than belong to the group 'bisexual'."
bisexual,3dg4mv,Turisan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I think what you're trying to say is, ""bi isn't anything besides gay or straight"".  While that's true, it's best to leave personal labels to the persons they are referring to. If you're not comfortable using bi as an identifier or label, don't.   Personally, for the description you used for yourself, I'd use something like homo-flexible. Sounds silly, but is accurate.   Bi is an orientation, and it does encompass a large area between gay and straight, but not all of it. However, each individual picks the label that best fits them.   For instance, I'm somewhere around a Kinsey 2, but I still identify as bi, because that's what fits to me."
bisexual,3dg4mv,Turisan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"Homoflexible fits me- and but the issue I am addressing here is that both homoflexible and heteroflexible fall under the 'bisexual umbrella' - they are seen as a ""type of bisexual""- which to me completely does not make sense. A homosexual or straight person with some flexibility is not the same as a bisexual person with preference- both will have a different innate experience of their sexuality.   When ""bisexual"" is used to describe non-bisexual orientations, simply because they are somewhere on the sexuality continuum, that is not gay or straight, and when we define the sexuality spectrum as ""bisexual spectrum"", what happens the difference between 'bisexual' as a valid orientation, and other valid orientations disappears- everybody who is not completely straight or gay falls under the umbrella, even when their orientation is not actually bisexual as such."

bisexual,3dg4mv,NappyWarrior,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:29:22 2015 UTC,It is different because 'gay and lesbian' does not claim the entirety of  the sexuality spectrum.  eg you don't become 'automatically gay' -if you are not 100% straight.

I dunno, that's not really a lot to go off of, and it sounds like you don't even have enough experience to know yourself.     How do i know until i kiss a girl   That's an incredibly unfair and biased way of looking at the situation, and sadly, seems to be the way the general populace looks upon this kind of situation.  I've never kissed a guy, and the one time I was with one, I was utterly unimpressed and wrote it off as a no-go.  Here I am, though, years later, confident in my bisexuality.  As a counter argument to that logic, how do straight people know they're straight without ever having sex to begin with?  It follows the same line of logic, yet no one will doubt that off the bat.  You're attracted to women, and you're wanting women.  As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry about what to call yourself, but rather what you want to do for yourself.

I had similar reactions to taste and smell (and kissing the same sex) in my teenage years, and I found the male body physically uninteresting. Not repulsive though, and I had fetishes for being penetrated by a man. Those fetishes gradually grew and fleshed out into a full-blown orientation over like... a decade. As my attractions grew they began overriding those initial reactions to taste and smell. Now the taste/smell of semen turns me on, the physical 'chunkiness' of the male body turns me on. The saltiness is fairly neutral. Also, the taste of a woman's vulva is still intoxicating as before.  It's interesting because it's a different sort of 'flavor' of turn-on for men compared to women. It's like comparing sweet to savory. The female body is like a brownie fudge ice cream sunday, and the male body is like a filet mignon. A different part of my brain is satiated with each."

I've talked about this in this sub before--basically, sociopathic personality types will generally have the capacity for bisexuality/gender indifference due to their disregard for societal norms and acknowledgement of the power of sex/intimacy. So from day 1 I had a tacit understanding that Frank was probably bisexual. The author of ""Confessions of a Sociopath"" refers to it as gender indifference rather than bisexuality, but my point stands.  Then, it's spelled out almost explicitly during his conversations with his old army friend when they got wasted (at the library that was being opened in his name)."

bisexual,3db2qw,hybbprqag,12,Wed Jul 15 10:34:42 2015 UTC,"Overall, pretty good article on bi erasure in the media. I did have a problem with this, though:   If you’re a woman having sex with women regularly, you are not “one hundred percent straight” — you’re one hundred percent bad at math.   I'm of the belief that you can be straight and fool around with the same sex. It's how straight people can enjoy threesomes, and it's how some of them figure out that they're not bi or gay, and it's how some of them get off when they wanna get off quickly and NSA.  It does no one any good to say someone can't identify how they want. And it does no one any good to insist on rigid definitions for labels.  If a straight guy goes and gets head from his neighbor every now and then, but has zero interest in anything romantic or in his neighbor at all, and all he wants is a bj, must he call himself bisexual? I think insisting that yes, he does is just as silly as insisting that we all need to pick a side."
bisexual,3db2qw,InfinitelyThirsting,6,Wed Jul 15 12:41:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I don't think we should use terms like 'bisexual' or 'homosexual' like taxonomy terms. These words are meant to be empowering and to allow us to express how we view ourselves and our identities. If someone identifies as lesbian, but felt attraction to men at some point, far be it from me to tell her what that means about her identity.  Plus, if we define people by the actions they've taken sexually and not their inner views, then anyone who hasn't had sex yet would technically be asexual."
bisexual,3db2qw,thatoneguy54,9,Wed Jul 15 15:28:18 2015 UTC,"You can be straight and still fool around--but you aren't one hundred percent straight. You're straight enough that straight is accurate, maybe. But there's also a difference between experimenting once or twice and deciding you are 100% straight, and regularly and continuously for a long period of time having homosexual sex that you enjoy, while still trying to pretend you are 100% straight. Maybe 100% heteroromantic, sure, but not heterosexual.  Labels are meaningless if they don't have any definition. And while enjoying the occasional threesome or past experimentation isn't ""enough"" to make me think someone is ridiculous for not calling themselves bisexual, having an active sex life with both sexes is, especially when they're happily shoving their face into the genitals they claim they don't like."
bisexual,3db2qw,InfinitelyThirsting,4,Wed Jul 15 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but I think the quantifier ""100%"" is completely useless and just serves to erode people's identities, especially since 100% has a connotation of ""full"" or ""real"".  Imagine if someone said that about bisexuals. ""In order to be 100% bisexual you need to like men and women exactly equally and have an even number of romantic and sexual interactions with every gender!"" It's ridiculous, and it's just as ridiculous to say the same for straight or gay people (or asexual, or pansexual, or whatever.)  I think people are far too rigid with the word straight. All labels, not just bisexual, need to be thought of as umbrella terms for all the different permutations of sexuality that exist in the world."

bisexual,3db2qw,Azusanga,22,Wed Jul 15 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"Ostensibly, I disagree, but I recognize this may be unpopular. First, I do not think a show needs to say the word ""bisexual"" for it to acknowledge bisexuality and give it at least some justice as it does a variety of diverse sexualities. Some of the examples in the article itself could be used in any other article arguing the antithesis: the show commonly does draw attention to bisexuality and some of the struggles they face understanding themselves and dealing with society (e.g. Piper mentioning a spectrum, ""I like hot people"", she constantly struggles to express her sexuality (that's huge!), Piper's sexuality gets ""erased"" by other characters, Cal's line about people wanting things to be labeled something, and so on and so on).   Indeed, Piper is not a strong character and does not put forth a strong protagonist for combatting bisexual erasure literally within the show. Its unfortunate that such a weak character is considered the only bisexual in the show apparently.  But I simply cannot get behind the idea that the creators of BY FAR one of the best shows for issues of sexuality, race, inequality, transphobia, prison, etc., are allowing bi-erasure ""from the fabric of the show itself"".  I actually find Piper's struggle to deal with the other characters to be realistic (as the article mentions) and a nuanced way of demonstrating the difficulties of bisexuals in real life. I don't need a longer soap box speech about ""the spectrum"" than they already gave. (Ostentatious) heavy handedness in the pop culture in regards to often ignored spaces (bisexuality) will get you nowhere - that is what I think the writers understand. Also, Piper does not fight those who make erasing comments because that would be totally out of her character - it is, after all, a TV show and those things need to be taken into consideration. And in terms of other characters: 1) Cal generally understands and has stood up for ""non-binary"" sexualities throughout the show 2) not all characters get away with bi-erasure - some of the worst portrayed, self-centered characters (Piper's husband) get shade for not understanding the diverse sexualities present in the show.   In short, I think there are examples to the contrary of this article. And at the end the of day I am going to put OINTB in the ""win"" category. I am OK with seeing a bisexual struggle on screen because maybe I feel like there are people who understand the struggle - It was nice to see that I am not the only one who has messed up relationships because I have difficulty explaining my sexuality with the language we are given. Not to mention, when Piper gets explicit about explaining her beliefs it often gets cringey (see her rant about atheism when talking to Pennsatucky... its just awkward)."
bisexual,3db2qw,sproo,6,Wed Jul 15 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"I would have to disagree. Frequently, she refers to herself as either a lesbian or straight, and never anything in between. Orientation is brought up quite often, so there is ample opportunity for explanations. At one point, Alex mentions the Kinsey scale- so it isn't like they're completely ignorant to all of the ""in between"". If I remember the quote correctly, she says ""You fall further down on the Kinsey scale than I do"" (in reference to seducing the baby-faced guard).  She's also absolutely not the only bisexual- were we watching the same show? What about Lorna? All of the women who have men on the outside who ""get theirs"" while in the prison?"

I just don't think further explanation of her sexuality is necessarily justified in the show. But we can agree to disagree.  However, in reference to your last point (""She's absolutely not the only bisexual..."") - I actually agree. It definitely wasn't very clear on my part looking back but I said ""only bisexual in the show APPARENTLY,"" in reference to other comments (and the article) making it seem like she is the only one."

bisexual,3db2qw,zygocactus,2,Wed Jul 15 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"I think people, in general, don't want to admit bisexuality exists because they would likely come to the conclusion that they aren't a 0 or 6 on the Kinsey scale. It's okay, for most straight people especially, for there to be a ""kink"" in social norms, so long as they are not the ones perpetrating it. Likewise, gay people would have to admit they they are hiding from the ""norm"" of society. We just acknowledge that the social norm is an absurd concept and that we can just be sexual, loving, honest creatures. Whether that involves a penis or vagina is inconsequential, and gays/straights are ready to admit it."
bisexual,3dcq5d,abigail08,13,Wed Jul 15 06:23:26 2015 UTC,"Did you need to start dating guys to know that your attraction to them is real and valid? If you didn't, then think of girls the same way: You don't need experience to validate your feelings. They're just as real and valid even without ""evidence"" of it.  You don't need to date one to ""prove"" anything to anybody. Do what makes you happy, within the realm of what won't totally hurt the people you care about. So if you ever feel inclined to date women, it is possible to open up your and your fiancé's relationship a bit, so your commitment to each other doesn't change, but you can still explore your interest in women. But do this only if you want to, not to prove a point to others that you're a ""real"" bisexual. Your sexual identity doesn't require experience; it just requires that you accept yourself.  It's normal to feel like you have to prove something, but your preferences don't need that. You can choose to -- or not to -- express your sexuality in whatever manner makes you comfortable."
bisexual,3dcq5d,abyssinicum,9,Wed Jul 15 07:00:36 2015 UTC,"Orientation is based on attractions, not actions, and the labels we have for it are self-applied. You are bisexual. Why? Because you are attracted to both men and women and so choose to identify as such. You are bisexual. It doesn't matter that you've never been with another woman, you don't need to have been to know. You know. Some people might try to challenge that or take it away from you. Don't let them. They don't have your attractions and they aren't in your head. There's no bisexuality entrance exam or ""you must have boned this many genders"" sign. Do you feel attractions, even varied and unequal, towards both genders? You are bisexual. And now you've found love, and that's great for you."
bisexual,3dcq5d,runBAMrunfaster,2,Wed Jul 15 07:04:09 2015 UTC,"Others have answered the other questions already, so I just want to answer your final question... yes it's normal to have desires but not necessarily act on them, and yes it's normal to worry about it, and yes you do not need to prove or justify anything to anyone. Your sexuality is ultimately only something you need to be content with in yourself, it's got nothing to do with anyone else's opinion (although it's good that you can talk to your fiance about it).  You're fine :)"
bisexual,3dcq5d,BrokenDesires,2,Wed Jul 15 13:11:58 2015 UTC,"Your story really speaks to me because I have found myself in a similar situation. I was only ever with girls back when I was a teen, but I have had sexually curious thoughts about girls and boys my entire life in the same way and amount. I struggled for a long time about whether or not I was ""really bi"" because I had been with like 5x as many men as women, but I've realized that actions aside the thoughts and feelings have always been there.  I guess all I'm trying to say is that yes, it seems like a normal thing to me. Being bisexual is so confusing because it's...just one big grey area we have to find our place in, and I'd say that most if not all bisexuals still have a preference one way or another at times. I have gone through the same feelings as you so far in my life(I'm 23) but I've just had to realize that sexuality is what it is and if you're lucky you can find a label that suits it later. I always felt I didn't have anything to ""back it up"" because I lacked the amount of tangible experiences, but the intangible ones should count as evidence in their own."

Coming out is hard, but feelings can also get hurt the longer you're in a relationship with someone without being totally honest with them. It probably doesn't change your relationship in any way, but coming out to your fiance now as opposed to ten years down the line mostly like helped save him some hurt feelings.   Congratulations on your wedding. :)"

They'll just accept your identity for what it is and love and support you just like they always did. I will tolerate questions about my sexuality because that's a person wanting to understand my experience, but demands for proof? Fuck that. You are what you are and you feel what you feel. No need to justify it and it's totally ok to tell people that you won't justify yourself. In regards to whether or not your experience is normal, that I couldn't say. But it's very similar to mine, and that's not the first time I've said that on this sub, so you're not alone."
bisexual,3dbmh9,jogam,12,Wed Jul 15 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"I heard about this a while ago. I was hesitant to watch it when I first saw a link today because I get anxious watching things like this about topics that affect me personally, but overall I thought it was a great talk. My one critique is I'm wondering why she did not mention pansexuality, which seems to encompass her cutesy pisexuality but is an already existing term. The pi/circle/pie/pan thing could have been played up for cutesiness, also, if she wanted."
bisexual,3dbmh9,trans-sister,3,Wed Jul 15 05:02:41 2015 UTC,"There's little I disagree with this, but it wasn't primarily about bisexuality. recognition of non binary gender is not a sexuality. Not only that, but it implies that you are bad if your sexuality supports binary gender. Say someone likes only manly men. Are they bad for it? No. That's their preference"
bisexual,3dbmh9,ImmortalOsiris,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was gonna comment on this too; when did bisexuality stop being a sexuality to become a philosophy? I mean, I'm bi, and I know there's transgender people and genderqueer and all the RGB spectrum on the rainbow, but I'm not attracted to them. I'm sexually attracted to cis males, cis females, and romantically attracted to cis females. And I don't deny them their identities; I just don't feel that way about them. So why should I change my whole sexual identity just to make some people I don't even know happy? Really, I have nothing against non-binary people, but it's not really my thing to stop and give a twenty-minutes-long rant on my views on sexual identity every time people ask me why I'm checking out a guy."

But, I caution you against using porn to decide what you like and don't like sexually.   There are lots of things in porn that I enjoy watching, but don't enjoy doing. On the flip side, there are things in porn that I find boring to watch, but love in real life.   Porn is fantasy, and fantasy is healthy and wonderful, but fantasy will not always mimic what works in real life. Basically, don't watch porn, get turned on, and assume that that is automatically what you will like in actual sex.   When you get around to actually having sex with guys, go with your gut and go with what feels good. Don't just assume that ""well I like hard fucking in porn so I definitely want to be fucked that way"". You might like it one day, you also might want to build up to it.   You don't have to jump in the deep end immediately. Explore with porn, but don't let it be a guide for your actual sex life, with women or with men."

Anyway I watch a lot of bi and gay porn. Personally I love MMF (two males, one female) threesomes, especially if the guy bottoming is fucking a girl or she's giving him head, stuff like that. Also double vaginal DP gets me hot because they even do it outside of bi porn so two ""straight"" guys are touching cocks inside one girl. FYFF which means fuck yeah friendly fire refers to when guys cum on each other while double teaming a girl.  As far as gay porn goes, well you have a lot of different stuff out there. I wouldn't say I'm into twinks so much cute boys, but the videos by Helix Studios (which are very easy to find on pornhub) feature very young attractive guys. Often that open with something like throwing a football around then one of them tackles the other. It's just adorable.   I said twinks before, those are like your really youthful, slender, and usually white boys come in.   Daddy refers to like an older gentleman, think 40 up, who plays like a dominant role to a usually younger boy.   Bears are your really thick, burly and hairy fellows.   It really depends on your taste just think of buzz words. Stud is a really good one for your amateur straight porn where all you can see is the guys' ass as he's just plowing his girl.   I hope I've shed some light."

bisexual,3ddsr9,bithrowaway17,5,Wed Jul 15 14:13:11 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by this: by CD you mean cross dresser, yes?  But you keep referring to this person as ""she"". Was this a trans woman, or a cross dresser? These terms are not equivalent. A trans woman is a woman who may or may not have a penis (depending on whether or not she has had bottom surgery). A cross dresser is a man who gets off on dressing like a woman, and may pretend to be a woman for sexual purposes but is in fact a man.   If you slept with a trans woman and couldn't get aroused, there could be any number of reasons for that, but sleeping with a trans woman doesn't make you gay or bisexual. A trans woman is a woman. If you are a dude, that is still straight sex, even if she has a penis. Maybe you aren't into penis. That's fine.   If you slept with a cross dresser there again could be any number of reasons for why you weren't turned on. Maybe it was the fact that your partner was male or maybe you just aren't into this particular male.   One bad sexual experience doesn't make or break your sexuality. If you are attracted to men and women, bisexual is a good label. If you are only attracted to men or women exclusively, then perhaps it's not a good label. Regardless, this one encounter does not define you."
bisexual,3ddsr9,Gallifreyan_fez,2,Wed Jul 15 16:47:09 2015 UTC,At least in certain spaces it's common to refer to cross dressers by the pronoun that matches their character as long as they are in character.
bisexual,3ddsr9,ganderso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"It is.  It's also common to use 'gurl' as a description.   And I think that makes sense because cross-dressing is not the same is being transexual. There is some overlap and can be used as a segue, but some men 'play' as women. It is a different thing really."

I know, a long time to not tell someone something like that, but I only recently accepted it, myself. I didn't like that there was this aspect of myself she knew nothing about.  I brought the subject up because I remembered my gf had talked about wanting to sort of experiment with a girl, so I got to wondering if maybe she was a little bi-curious. (It's not really something we'd ever seriously talked about.) So I asked a couple really dumb questions about how she felt about her sexuality, and after a while of that, she asked if I felt any attraction towards men. I told her yes, and that I'd been with other males before, but that I have a strong preference for women. And women are the only people I've had strong romantic feelings for. We spoke more in depth for a while, but I'll spare any further details.  As I said before, I was really awkward and nervous, and kinda refused to believe that it was really ok. But today's a new day, and I'm feeling happier than I have in a long time."

I'm bisexual, my boyfriend is straight, and we both came to the decision that we happy in nonmonogamy. We're about your age. I suggest you be you without caring too much about adding to a perceived stereotype. If someone asks you about it, just repeat that you being bisexual doesn't have anything to do with your decision to be nonmonogamous with your partner (if that's what you decide to do), and you're golden on the ""fighting stereotypes"" front. If we decided to live our lives according to how other people would perceive us, this subreddit community might not even exist!  Perhaps (total speculation), this became a stereotype because people willing to identify as bisexual (a sexuality sometimes marginalized even in the LG community) are also willing to explore nontraditional relationships? I don't think being bisexual makes you nonmonogamous by any means, but perhaps there is a correlation due to an exploratory personality that accepts many facets of relationships and gender attraction?

The only people who have any business about what you do in your bedroom are those you invite into it.

bisexual,3dbzg9,avapoet,2,Wed Jul 15 09:39:55 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of bisexual folks being monogamous. I'm one of them. There have always been bisexual people being monogamous, and the stereotype ignores them because those people don't want to see it. It doesn't fit a bigots narrative, and they're just trying to be harmful to LGB folk and find errors with their wiring-- because sex is considered a problem to so many people. (Not including the T because there are other harmful stereotypes-- promiscuity isn't one that specifically gets put on T folk.) Straight people also choose polyamory or open relationships or swinging which is a perfectly fine choice to make, and these people are also seen as weird or bad or damaged or quirky or whatever.  Honestly, I'm surprised queer activists would argue for ""assimilation politics"" which monogamy could fall into. In my area, gay rights activists might do this-- the ""We need gay marriage above anything else/ once we look and act like suburbanites, we will be considered real people."" crowd. The activists specifically using the term queer tend to argue for the recognition of polyamory as a viable, worthy and not-damaged way of living. They would extend this to say that bisexual people should not feel that they are ""damaging a movement"" or something because they also should freely choose if they want to do this.  OP- You do you. I'm so happy with my partner, but this has nothing to do with you! You aren't wrong or bad or a pest or anything because you are curious about and/or interested in polyamory. This is your choice to make, and you aren't ""damaging our movement."" You aren't making bisexuals look bad. You and I could stand next to one another, and the person who wants to see bisexuals as greedy will literally ignore my existence (or label me ""straight"") and argue 100% of bisexuals are greedy based on their sample size of 1 OR their sample size of 2 because, ""Don't worry- in time that greedy foxandflora will cheat on their beau."" There's no winning with people like that, and you don't need to politically make a statement and restrict yourself and your choices."

To point out: the people we're enjoying sex WITH obviously don't have a problem with this! :) :) :)"
bisexual,3dbzg9,airwaveraid87,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:46 2015 UTC,"There's so much middle ground.  For a start, when people talk about monogamy, they don't mean the same thing that was meant by the term a hundred years ago. Nowadays, people mean serial monogamy. Some people want to find somebody to be in a monogamous relationship for for the rest of their life, but even among those people, the likelyhood is (for any given relationship) that they won't. And plenty of other people set more-moderate goals, e.g. that they'd like to be in a relationship and that it should last as long as it's satisfying for them both, and that while they hope that will be a long time - perhaps the rest of their lives - they accept that it may well not be and that's fine: a relationship isn't a failure if it's not death that ends it!  And then there's the monogamish: people who perhaps have the ocassional three-way, or for whom ocassional negotiated nonmonogamy might be okay, or those who practice e.g. ""zipcode monogamy"". There are a huge number of options in the middle, and the first step is to decide what it is you're looking for (with the proviso that you might change your mind: everybody might!).  Working your way along the scale, you find the swingers, the polyamorists, the relationship anarchists... folks who fully embrace the fact that they're going to want relationships (perhaps sexual, perhaps romantic...) with other people. Sometimes people in relationships will limit this by gender (e.g. One Penis Policies, ick), others in different ways. The key thing is honesty and communication.  As for me: I'm in an polyamorous relationship that's nominally open, but finding time to date is challenging for any trio with a 1-year-old kid, never mind one that's involved in as many different bits of voluntary work etc. as we are! But the fact that we're only theoretically-open is in many ways 'enough'. I know that there are people out there of my gender and people of other genders who are potentially 'available' to me, and that is for the most part sufficient.  tl;dr: There are many options. Consider what your ideal situation would be. Then aim for that (but consider also what compromises you would be willing to make to get close to it)."
bisexual,3dbzg9,onahotelbed,0,Sun Jul 19 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"I get so frustrated with this sentiment. Monogamy is not an identity: it's a set of choices and behaviours. The same goes for polyamory. Everyone is capable of being monogamous if they're willing to make the compromises necessary to do so, just as everyone is capable of getting a post-secondary degree. It takes work and it's not always comfortable, but it's about a commitment and not about feeling dandy 100% of the time.   When I hear people say they could never be monogamous, all I hear is them saying how they could never go beyond themselves to compromise for, and commit to, another person. And the reverse is true, too. Polyamory takes work and commitment and compromise. Nobody is absolutely incapable of either, they're just afraid to do the work."
bisexual,3dbzg9,airwaveraid87,9,Wed Jul 15 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"Afraid to do the work and not wanting to do the work aren't necessarily the same thing. Some people honestly don't want to commit to another person, for reasons beyond being afraid."
bisexual,3dbuaf,Bethfy,7,Wed Jul 15 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"The definition I've heard most trans people use is ""identifying with a gender other than the gender you were assigned at birth."" Some other definitions can be problematic, like endorsing the idea that sex and gender are binary.  This is a good list for terminology. /r/asktransgender would also be a good place to ask. Although we have lots of trans folk in this sub, I always encourage people to guarantee that they're getting their definitions from the community itself."

I read one trans person say it makes them feel like the person using it stopped educating themselves about trans issues back in the 80s, lol. Since it originated in the medical field, it has some pathologizing baggage. But some choose to reclaim the word, so if someone explicitly refers to themselves as transsexual, that's the only time I would use it. Otherwise ""transgender"" works just fine."

I'd personally rephrase that as ""Someone who identifies as a gender other than the one that they were assigned at or near birth."" There are two subtle differences in my phrasing than yours:  (a) firstly, my definition acknowledges that gender is not binary, and  (b) it also observes that somebody's biological sex is not necessarily the same as that which they are assigned when they are born: some individuals are mis-assigned (either because they were born intersex into a community that did not interpret this as acceptable, or for other reasons) - for example, there have been individuals whose biological sex and eventual gender identity are in-sync, but that neither were the sex they were assigned and/or raised as.  Also worth bearing in mind that XX and XY are not the only two configurations of the sex chromosones.  Just my tuppenceworth!   (see also /u/xotacoxo's comment, here, for basically the same thing)"

He completely respects my sexuality and is fine if I have casual sexual relationships with other women, even if it is on the rare occasion. I am more romantically attracted to men and sexually to women.   We have also discussed exploring open relationship possibilities for him although we haven't really reached a point where he feels comfortable to do that.   I guess my advice would be, when you find a partner let them know your sexuality upfront. Don't keep it hidden. I told my S.O in the first week we started dating. That way you can talk about what you are comfortable with and not comfortable with in your relationship. It's about communication and respect. What works for me and my S.O might not work for everyone.   Good luck, have fun, and be safe. You'd be surprised how many people are open minded these days! :)"

As someone who is now 31, that was in the dating scene 5-8 years ago, I ran into plenty of women on dating sites that were interested in me right up until I told them I was bi, and then theyd disappear. Expect some people not to accept it. It will turn some women off. But, eventually, you'll meet someone who can accept you and your sexuality."
bisexual,3d8uh6,missafine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, I can empathize with that. It is definitely more culturally acceptable for women to be bisexual than men. The thing that really sucks about being bisexual, is you are ALWAYS coming out. There is not one defining moment where you ""came out"" because with every new partner, and every new conversation with a new person, there is an opportunity to come out.   Unfortunately, there is no concrete way to solve your internal dilemma. Dating is a trial by error. Some people you date are going to be turned off by the fact you like the opposite sex. It has happened to me with a girl before. She did not like the fact that I was bisexual and not a lesbian. But that's why we are not together anymore.   When you meet an open-minded lady or man who respects you and shares the same values as yourself, that's where a successful relationship can blossom.   Personally, if I were not in a relationship with a straight man I would love to be with a fellow bisexual. Maybe you can seek out a particular community that fits with your lifestyle!"

To answer your question honestly, I just enjoyed being with my last girlfriend.  Whether we were studying together, watching TV together, cleaning together, hiking together...just being with her was much more important than having an orgasm.  Don't get me wrong, we were intimate...maybe an average of 1-2 times a week, but it was just spending time with her that made it all worthwhile.  So, it was never an issue.  When we were dating, I never once looked at a guy, or another girl, in either a romantic or sexual way.  Even when masturbating, I was thinking of her, not watching porn."

Our relationship is perfect because I love her very very much and she loves me, and I couldn't possibly fall in love with somebody else. Here's the part where things get awesome.  My wife has always wanted to do an MMF, and I've always wanted to see her with another guy.  So with a little bit of luck, we were able to find another guy to participate in sexy fun time. Having sex with a 3rd party from time to time is super hot and has made our relationship closer.  So it's very possible for you to find a female that you love that will not only love you (yay), but also peg you (yay), and also share the mutual love and participation and trust that enables you to still have sex with the guys."

My advice for now would be to imagine yourself in a romantic relationship; if it seems like that's something you'd like to do, then go for it. If it seems like it's not something you're interested in, or if it's something you want just to fulfill a societal obligation, then you might be aromantic.

It might be that you're too open towards women about your sexuality for it to work for you. In my experience, women might be more likely to shun a bisexual man if they know about it at the outset. My rule is to tell women after we've actually hooked up, and I've never gotten an ""EEEEWWWWW GET AWAY"" kind of response (sometimes quite the opposite, actually). I don't see it as wrong.  ""But I feel more comfortable chatting up and flirting with men than I do women, partially because I know women are often objectified by a lot of guys, so I try not to blatantly check them out or hit on them and be seen as creepy.""  I've had a lot more success with women since I let go of a lot of that attitude and being ""creepy."" Obviously don't persist when a woman's clearly uninterested or uncomfortable, but women like attention, they like sex, and you're no creepier than any other man who likes to sleep with women--probably a lot less."

I'm not looking for a hookup, but someone who holds the same values as me. I appreciate your reply though."
bisexual,3d7sem,throwaway18367,8,Tue Jul 14 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"I can still see myself being in a relationship with both sexes   I think you have already answered your own question OP, and that's all that matters. The notion that you can't be 95% gay, because even being 5% straight makes you bi simply promotes the binary concepts of sexuality. The fact is, it's not. Sexuality is a scale, or a spectrum. That's why we have the Kinsey scale. On one end we have the heterosexual extreme and over the other end we have the homosexual extreme, only in rare cases does anyone ever falls squarely into these extremes. Because even a totally straight (but not narrow) person can appreciate the beauty of the same gendered person, perhaps in some special circumstances, might even be aroused by the idea of being sexually active with the person. [I don't know for sure] But perhaps that's why prison sexuality exist, in given circumstances same sex inmates might find each other for sexual and emotional intimacy. So sexuality is not something that squarely falls into the category of ""straight"", ""bi"" or ""gay"" as most people make it out to be.  Tell you what OP, I am a monogamous person who has no interest in polyamory or open relationships, and doesn't like the idea of casual sex without a relationship, and still it makes perfect sense to me to call myself a bisexual, even if the attraction to either sex (or all sexes) are not at all that equal. Bisexuality simply means possibility of attraction to either sexes, not promiscuity. Once again, that's how I choose to define it. And I'm happy and proud with the label.  At the end of the day the person who should define your sexuality is you, so if you feel like you are bisexual, then you should call yourself one. The same thing also goes to how you define how you want your relationship with other sexes to be. So if you feel like that an element of a relationship with either a male or a female is missing, and you don't want to pursue it, then certainly the relationship is doomed. But if you value one element over the other, and truly love the person you are with, then I'm sure you will both find a way to work it.  Have fun exploring your sexuality OP :)"
bisexual,3d7sem,SarcSense,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice :) I'm not saying I see myself with both - that was just an example. And I don't think bisexual people are promiscuous at all; I just know that some bisexual people who feel like they would be missing out if they didn't get to experience both genders find a way to incorporate that into a relationship, through polyamory or having an open relationship. Other bisexual people just accept that once they settle down they probably won't be with the other sex again, and let it be.   I don't know if I'm bisexual. As a girl, I don't really have strong feelings towards guys. I used to think I had tiny crushes on them in middle school and elementary school, but looking back, I don't think I actually did. I don't get butterflies around guys. At most, when I see a really sweet guy, I feel a strong sense of affection/admiration, but more like I would feel for a family member. I don't know. I know I can care about a guy as a friend, which makes me feel like making the leap to romance wouldn't be that much of a stretch. I can appreciate when a guy is attractive, and while I don't see myself actively initiating sex with guys, the idea doesn't sound absolutely horrible/repulsive to me (which is something a lot of gay people seem to say - that the idea of it is disgusting to them). I might even try it at some point in my life, I don't know. Even though these 'attractions' are just sort of weak or partially there, I just don't know if that makes me bisexual or gay."

I don't really ""like"" the male body - I don't like certain secondary sex characteristics like body hair. But I don't have a problem with penises at all, and a lot of lesbians seem to say that's the basic requirement for being one (usually the same lesbians who say using any sort of phallic-looking object makes you bisexual). I admire male qualities like the male figure and a deep voice, but I just don't know if I'm attracted to them. Either way, I've never really had any strong feelings towards a guy."

bisexual,3d7sem,raggedydoc,2,Tue Jul 14 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"I guess the real purpose of a label is to let other people know what you're interested in. It's a shorthand for explaining your sexuality in one or two words. You can use the word ""mostly"" before a label. You can tell different people different things. You don't have to decide on one thing and tattoo it on your forehead. You don't even need to use a label at all if you want, you can just explain your sexuality the long way.   A lot of people take their label as an identity, because they want to belong to a community. So many people ignore part of their sexuality just so they can feel like they fit in with other people."

bisexual,3d7sem,zygocactus,2,Wed Jul 15 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"I (F) had thought myself straight when I got married to my straight husband even though I have some same-sex experience. At the time, I figured that since the FF experience wasn't compelling, I could chalk it up to experimentation. We talked about it and set it aside. And for many people, that would be the end of it.  Ten years later, I realized that was not the end of it. Was I still attracted to my husband? Yes. Or was I a lesbian and just kidding myself? After much internal turmoil, I decided no, but I accepted that I was not a Kinsey 0, either. At that point, I still thought bisexuality to be a 50-50 thing.  Sometime between then and now, I figured it out. I stopped sweating the labels and  repressing the FF attraction. I am monogamous and in an opposite-sex marriage but still not straight."
bisexual,3d7sem,sceptical_unicorn,2,Tue Jul 14 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say that you don't have to have ""zero"" attraction to the opposite sex to consider yourself gay- a lot of gay people fall under the 5 on the Kinsey scale. Then some bisexual people also fall under 5 on the Kinsey scale- it all depends on how your attraction works.   The Kinsey scale is open to interpretation. Eg. ""Kinsey 5"" is technically either 'bisexual' or 'predominantly homosexual'- and for various people it takes on those separate meanings.   The majority of Kinsey 5 people use the ""gay"" label- simply because this is probably how their attraction works- it has to do with the quality of the attraction.  In fact the proportion of gay-identified people who are are a Kinsey 5 is probably around 40% of all gay people.   They have probably decided that the attraction to the opposite sex is not strong enough/ sexual enough etc for them to act on it, so they stick to the label which describes their sexual and romantic orientation better- 'only wants to be with the same sex, and not capable of being with the opposite sex'   Then there are those Kinsey 5 people who fall on the scale not because of the quality of their attraction, but the quantity- eg they very infrequently experience attraction to the opposite sex- but when they do, the quality of it is still strong enough for them to consider acting on it in some way. They are the ones who choose the 'bi' label- because they feel they are capable of being with both.   You absolutely can be a 95%-5% in your attraction and be bisexual- because you can see yourself with both, or even 99%- 1%. You don't have to be 50%- 50%.  But you can  also be  95%-5% and be gay- because you cannot see yourself with both, and/or a significant component/attraction is missing for you for the opposite gender- and you will never feel like you can be with both.    There is also the label homoflexible- which I kind of like."

Certainly you don't have any reason to beat yourself up about her not being able to have consented to sex, seeing as how nothing truly sexual happened.    Although it is kinda weird she went from trying to make out with you to crying on your husband's lap, I suppose.   I think also it was because the alcohol numbed me.   What do you mean?  Are you indirectly saying that you were an equal participant in this kiss you now regret?   I also feel like I was a bit used.    Why in particular?"
bisexual,3d5uxz,Coidzor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding... part of me did want the kiss. She was cute and I was inexperienced but I knew I was probably barking up the wrong tree.  Yeah I guess it was non-sexual with me, but she put her hand down hubs' pants... I'm thinking she was trying something, albeit sloppy  I feel a bit used because she drank my booze and went overboard."

bisexual,3d3fcg,BrainMagMo,4,Mon Jul 13 07:57:31 2015 UTC,"Wow...I thought I was reading what MY MOM has done to me since I came out. Ill give a little background:  Came out 1.5 years ago. My dad was chill and took it well, mom said she was supportive but it ""was so unexpected"" and acted like I had cancer. She seemed very similar to yours and acted quite selfishly: will you have grand kids still... What will my family and others think of me... What can I tell them... Etc. Basically she was concerned with herself and didn't give a rats ass about me. She came across as passively homophobic to be honest; She claimed she was okay and cool with everything but avoids talking about anything lgbt, my bf, etc and takes no interest in them. It's been incredibly hurtful for her to act like this as her putting on a false affect toward me is almost as bad as disowning me.  It's been 1.5 years and she STILL hasn't changed a bit even though she said she would. She says she loves me but doesn't care at all about my happiness (and still says she says this is ""so new still""). So since she was still being passively homophobic and really hurtful I asked her point blank.   Now my mom is very emotional and doesn't like these conversations...as she'll get depressed and anxious but it was a ""damned if I do, damned if I don't"". As a frank an honest person I said I care about you but it pains me to see her act this way toward me an take no interest in my bf...and if she continue to make me unhappy I'd move out (l live 10 minutes from my grad school).   Don't let this fester and just talk to her. If she loves you she WILL come around. As for mine she thought she was doing an okay job but I made her realize she isn't... And now has a very more realistic picture of myself besides her disillusioned mental projections. While it was hard for her, I put our relationship on the table and on the line and she listened when I made something she cares about in trouble. Old habits die HARD, and your mom grew up in a different time and has different engrained views.   Best of luck, PM me if you want."
bisexual,3d3fcg,OhhCanadia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:11:55 2015 UTC,"It sounds as though your mother has three concerns: embarrassment / public shame, fear for your safety, fear for your future.  It's worth - and I realise this might be tough - seeing it from her perspective. The point of this is just to help you help her to make your life better.  With regards to embarrassment, she is likely to perceive bisexuality as both very embarrassing because it's unusual, and a particular form of sexual deviancy distinct from homosexuality. She's also likely to fail to understand why you need to identify as non-straight, ""You have a girlfriend and everything!"".  Explain to her what bisexuality is. Pick some bisexual figures your mother can relate to, and talk about their lives, and their relationships. Explain to her that you're monogamous (if you are), and that being bisexual doesn't mean you get up to anything unusual in bed. Explain to her that most queer people are bisexual. Finally, explain to her why it's important to you to be honest about yourself.  With regards to fear for your safety, just explain that the best thing she can do to protect your safety is to accept you for who you are. The biggest two risks to queer youth are parental rejection leading to homelessness, and parental rejection leading to self-harm or suicide. If she wants what's best for you, she has to accept you for who you are.  She probably thinks that by trying to avoid your gay side, she's doing what's best for you. You need to show her that she's wrong.  Finally, fear for your future. You are going to have to just be honest here. Tell her how you feel about having kids with a woman*, and how you feel about adopting kids with a man. If you want kids, tell her you can't have her in their lives if she can't accept you.  *Maybe this isn't the best time to explain to her that not all women have wombs."

It's kind of sad really- I moved hundreds of miles away. I sent a message home to mom saying I was skipping this year's family reunions because the family is too homophobic, and I can't take listening to them talk about ""diseased and confused deviants in need of psychological help"" in front of me. She lied to my siblings who are very supportive about why I wasn't coming. But I did talk to both my siblings individually about the real reason. Mom says she's supportive, but she's just so damn afraid of being embarrassed. I don't get it. I don't understand it at all. I definitely agree with the user who said to dig around for bi role models to show her that it isn't something embarrassing or shameful. The songwriter for The Oakridge Boys just recently had a documentary made about him- Jimbeau Hinson. Not only was he the first out bisexual man in the country music industry, but he's also been faithful to his wife for decades. I'm sure you could make a list of good bisexual men who are faithful to their women and make good contributions to society."

No it's wasn't intended to be an excuse, it is human emotion in response to someone trying to tell their sex life stuff to them all the while destroying the moms dreams of how she envisioned her life. She is entitled to them just like the OP is entitled to theirs.

The worst part is saying anything bad against the gay community gets us labeled as bigots, 'cause we're ""breaking solidarity"" and or ""stealing from actual gays"". Overall we're seen as the ""lesser gays"" and it sucks."

I've definitely dated girls that were super-jealous and assumed that I was going to leave them for a guy because I was actually gay and bi was just a transition. Not everyone is like that though.

bisexual,3d125j,erasureshmeerasure,17,Sun Jul 12 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"The fashion chic idea that a lesbian doesn't want anyone who has touched a penis doesn't hold up when you see how many lesbians have had sex with men in their past while they were finding their identity. It's also prejudice towards men, but nobody care about that (hypocrites).  If you have a man who is insecure about your bisexuality, that is their problem. I suggest you find a more confident and open minded person to be with.  You might also find plenty of men who would be happy to date a bisexual women. You can expect to find a lot of the proverbial ""let's have a threesome /can I watch"" guy.  If you could find a compatible bisexual woman or man I would entertain the idea that that would be the ideal. The misconception is that bisexuals just want the best of both worlds, the reality is that though there may be some perks to being bisexual, there are ugly sides to it as well. That's life.  Just be who you are, don't rely to heavily of others for acceptance and be proud of who you are. Don't let others insecurities, and prejudices hold you back."

Genitalia =/= gender.   I'm not saying every lesbian has to be attracted to trans women, ofc that's not the case.

And yes, I do feel that pansexuals are elitist bisexuals because I saw the term cone from people not wanting to be seen as transphobic based on gay people telling us what being bisexual meant. Don't get me wrong, I accept that it isn't defined that way, but I've yet to know or come across a pansexual who doesn't somehow bring up a preference of gender to how they are attracted to others, which is against the definition of regardless of gender, or brings up how they are pansexual because they aren't transphobic. It's sad, but it's my experience and what I see, and honestly, it gets worse when so many trans and non-binary people think they have to be pansexual to be trans or non-binary.   Bottom line, I'm also tired of being told who I am attracted to or that my sexuality is based on my partner, especially being trans masculine and bisexual."
bisexual,3d125j,airwaveraid87,22,Sun Jul 12 21:37:30 2015 UTC,I think it's even more transphobic to say that you have to have a special sexuality to be attracted to trans people. It further presents a divided between trans and sis people by making it seem like somebody with a more conventional sexuality could never be attracted to them. I think it was created in attempt to be more inclusive but I actually find it is more othering.
bisexual,3d125j,ahatmadeofshoes12,11,Mon Jul 13 00:28:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially when you consider that there isn't a similar word for straight/gay people.   A straight guy who is with a trans woman is still called straight, right? I'm pretty sure that trans women would argue if you called the guy gay for it.   But there's no pan-straight word. Same thing with a gay guy who is with a trans man. So why are we expected to abandon our label?"
bisexual,3d125j,vvelox,10,Mon Jul 13 01:37:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly gay and straight people can be attracted to trans people and it doesn't change their orientation, why is it that bisexual people need to change their orientation to designate that they aren't transphobic?

bisexual,3d125j,Mutual_Death,2,Mon Jul 13 23:06:47 2015 UTC,"From their sidebar:    Self-identified pansexuals may refer to themselves as gender-blind—that gender and sex are insignificant or irrelevant in determining whether they will be sexually attracted to others. Pansexuality encompasses all kinds of sexuality; not limited or inhibited in sexual choice with regards to gender or activity. Pansexuality can also mean the attraction to a person's personality, rather than their physical appearance or gender.   'Genderblind' sounds very close to the whole 'colourblind' thing that is inherently racist. Cis, trans, or non-binary, our gender identity is as much a part of who we are and what makes our experiences what they are so being blind to that is saying it doesn't matter when it will always matter.   The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the gender binary, the idea that there are only two genders, as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.   There's the whole ""we're not transphobic, see!"" As if bisexuals could care less about trans or non-binary people. How 'progressive' this sounds, only it doesn't.    You see, we're interested in the tea, not the cup!    I don't even know what to make of this analogy.  EDIT: I looked at some posts and one person keeps enforcing the ""bi means two"" bullshit and even when someone corrected them, says ""well I can admit you add trans people in there"" as if that isn't making trans people out to not be men or women just like cis people. Seriously, that person is transphobic as hell."

I gave it to you because more people need to say what you've said. We don't get support from the LG** community.  Rant incoming...  In my personal experience, I've received so much blatant, in-my-face prejudice from gay and lesbian people that I don't feel welcome any of those communities' spaces. Beyond that, I don't feel comfortable talking about my own orientation in most groups for fear of the legitimacy immediately being called into question in various ways by gay, straight and queer people, liberals and conservatives alike. I came out as bisexual when I was 15, and since then I've seen misunderstanding from all sides. I often qualify my orientation by saying that back then ""bisexual"" was the only word I had available to describe what I am, and that I just never adjusted to the term ""pansexual"". I feel like I need to say things like this now to appease the pc crowd and be inclusive of everyone, but the truth is, I'm usually attracted to feminine women and masculine men, and I don't fully understand why I've come to be ashamed of that. I can say that in the time I've been out as bisexual: I've been the brunt of jokes, I've been treated like I was available to have sex with anyone as if my choice and consent was irrelevant because of my orientation, I've had rednecks tell me I'm a lesbian and I've had lesbians tell me I'm straight. I've had lesbians refuse to date or even be friends with me solely because I'm bi, despite genuine interest before I told them that. I've had straight female friends grab me and start making out with me while out on the town only to get attention from some guys in the bar. It often feels like I just don't fit in anywhere - which is all the more disappointing because through high school and college I heard many promises of a safe space where people would accept people just like me, only to get there and find that acceptance is only available to people who fit some monosexual ideal. Oh and also I can't ""legitimately"" be a woman who is attracted to other women unless I dress like a man or am attracted to those who do. WTF?"

To me it seems very strange that we need a separate sexuality to be attracted to trans people. It just seems like it makes them other more than just saying that they can be attractive two people who identify as bisexual. Besides I've always seen bisexual to mean attraction to the same gender and people of a different gender which to me can potentially include the whole spectrum.

I do find we tend to talk about more gay-related things but when I have a girlfriend, there's no rude jokes or chastising.  I think this is just a case of 90% of people being jerks, not LGBT folks. Yes, gay people specifically should know better but most people, regardless of their orientation, are capable of being selfish, oblivious or unable to extrapolate their experiences to others in the form of empathy.  People who don't think it exists aren't worth my time, but I wouldn't discount a whole group just because a bunch of their members are jerks."

I don't know if I want to live in this world."
bisexual,3d125j,JarheadPilot,4,Sun Jul 12 22:02:54 2015 UTC,I feel like popular acceptance of homosexual attraction has been pitched as a 'we should accept them because the poor unfortunate souls have no choice' kind of thing.

Are my experiences more or less valid than a person who always felt they were exclusively gay from a young age? No.   The difference is that those people tend to try to erase experiences like mine, while I am very respectful...

bisexual,3d125j,dsalad,3,Mon Jul 13 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize biphobia was so prevalent.   As a recently out (but not proud) bisexual male, I decided to move beyond Grindr hookups and actually try for a relationship with another man. Tldr I found a guy, went on a few dates, and had sex, before I ran into some problems.   We were getting high in my bedroom so I don't really remember what led to him asking me ""when did you realize you were gay?""  Me: ""What are you talking about? I told you on our first date that I'm bisexual.""  Him: ""Yeah, but everyone says that when they're first coming out. It makes it easier for them to process the change. Trust me, you're gay.""  ""No, I'm bisexual. I'm still attracted to women. I masturbated to Mia Khalifa this afternoon when I woke up.""  Then he got really jealous, asking me about all the girls that I used to date who were still on campus. He wanted me to find them and tell them that I was dating him. He said that it would be a ""catharsis"".   Currently debating whether or not I should try and convince him of his bigotry or if it's just a lost cause. Based on what I've read of others' experience on this thread, I'm inclined to just break it off."
bisexual,3d125j,IBlameHisMother,2,Tue Jul 14 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"I would confront him on his biphobia. That kind of crap can ruin a relationship because he probably won't give up harassing you which just makes for unnecessary tension.

Everybody I knew before, straight, gay, or bi, treats me exactly as they did before.   I went off to uni ready to fight tooth and nail to be included, since it seemed that every single discussion of bisexuality on the internet talked about biphobia from lesbians and gay people. This assumption was actually backed up when I went to my first LGBT event and ran into a biphobic lesbian who made comments about how ""straight people shouldn't be allowed to come to these things"", looking pointedly at me until I clarified that I wasn't actually straight (gotta love that femme invisibility) and later in the night asked how I could possibly know that I was attracted to women if I'd never been with one before.  The thing is though, she was one, singular asshole. In the time between that event and now I haven't run into a single incidence of biphobia from that LGBT community. I was on the LGBT committee of my uni for a year, and half the people on said committee were also bisexual. I'm reading these stories of biphobia and prejudice from the LG part of the community with a sort of shocked disbelief that this kind of attitude is still prevalent."

bisexual,3d125j,sapphicninja,4,Tue Jul 14 09:17:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry you feel that way. Personally, those who I care about have never really given me any shit for being bisexual. Yeah I get the random social issue of family forgetting I'm bisexual and basing my sexuality on my partner, but I don't fault them when, if I say something, they acknowledge they were wrong and corrected themselves.   I might get lots of shit from the LG and sometimes the T (especially if their pansexual and tell me I'm transphobic for somehow invalidating trans and non-binary people while they ignore that I am trans) but that doesn't mean everyone will be that way.   As a community, bisexuals are becoming louder and prouder and not letting biphobia keep us back anymore. I also think that our support of trans issues is helping to deal with the biggest misconception that bisexuals are somehow transphobic when that's pretty much pansexuals at this point."
bisexual,3d125j,cheese93007,2,Tue Jul 14 08:07:16 2015 UTC,It just goes to show how widespread conformance pressure really is. Such a waste of energy.
bisexual,3d125j,sapphicninja,3,Tue Jul 14 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"I'm confused what you're responding to. Who's saying bisexuality reinforces the gender binary? The argument I've seen is that the term does, not the orientation. And the people most vocal about that argument are people who call themselves pansexual, so that's not the L G or strictly T.  As for cis preference, that's often born out of a lot of transphobic nonsense. Not being attracted to trans people isn't shameful but if it's stemming out of transphobia then recognizing that is something to work on. Again who's arguing this with bi people specifically, gay and straight people get told this just as much.  No disagreement on the rest"
bisexual,3d125j,cheese93007,8,Sun Jul 12 21:45:22 2015 UTC,"While I would definitely say that not being attracted to trans individuals is nearly always a result of transphobia, it's pretty hard to say that bisexuality as a term is inherently transphobic when trans inclusive definitions have been floating around since at least 1990. Hell the only way to even come to the conclusion that bisexuality is transphobic is either if you think that a special orientation is required to be attracted to trans people, or that not being attracted to non-binary people is transphobic. The former of which is pretty transphobic in and of itself, and the latter of which is not a standard we hold to monosexuals (and even then I'd bet most bi people would dig a non-binary person).    What's funny about all of this is lesbians in particular are God fucking awful at being trans friendly as a whole, and could easily be held responsible for some of the transphobic nonsense that came out if the Reagan administration and still affects trans people to this day. Yet NO ONE ever says lesbianism is inherently transphobic, despite lesbians being responsible for (from my pov) the majority of the transphobia within the LGBT community. Yet for some reason bi people are often the target when it comes to transphobia in the LGBT community. It's fucking frustrating"
bisexual,3d125j,sapphicninja,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"Again, who's actually arguing this. You just moved seamlessly from the term to the orientation, and I can't tell if I've been living under a rock and haven't seen any of these people arguing bisexuality is transphobic or if it's what it seems to me, which is that this is a use/mention error and people are confusing arguments over what the terminology implies with the orientation itself. And I say this as a trans woman who calls herself bisexual so obviously I don't think very much of those arguments over the terminology being transphobic.  And again, I've only seen that coming from pansexuals. So it's rather bizarre to include this as something that's making the OP not feel included within lgbt spaces because pansexuals are part of the B so that's an intra community fight.

And I have seen cis pansexuals claim they aren't transphobic so they must be pan or trans/non-binary people who claim that being trans/NB who aren't strictly attracted to one gender means they have to be pan because of biphobia like above or that any other sexuality would invalidate themselves."

It talks about the gay/straight washing though. For example, we're like 99% certain that Eleanor Roosevelt was bisexual. Another good read for historical figures getting straight/gay-washed that I'm admittedly in the middle of and haven't finished is ""A Queer History of the United States"" by Michael Bronski. The author is gay, but refuses to label individuals from the past as either bisexual or ""gay but hiding behind a wife and kids"". He says that only the individuals in question would've known which they are, so he will just state the facts and not assume (unless the person themself outright said something to indicate opposite sex attractions along with their same sex attractions).   Half Price Books stores actually can be a great place to find books on bisexuality. I'm a student at Wright State, and I went to our university library to look for bi books. I found a floor to ceiling shelf each for lesbian, gay, and transgender issues. I found two books on bisexuality... tucked in with books on pedophilia and beastiality :(  Our GLBTQA resource room had more books, but half price books had just as many, which was shocking because this is a somewhat conservative area in the American Midwest.

That doesn't mean that they don't face discrimination - and documenting that is important. It also means they face an uphill struggle to assert an identity that feels as authentically queer as they are. In some cases, the struggle to assert a non-queer identity in the face of those undermining it. In others, they struggle to assert a queer identity in the face of those undermining it.

bisexual,3d1kr2,Glarks,6,Mon Jul 13 03:10:27 2015 UTC,Name of the site is www.pride.com. You'll see the content ranges from click-baity to more serious. This is the last article I wrote and would like to continue writing more pieces along these lines:  http://www.pride.com/coming-out/2015/7/08/9-things-i-wish-i-knew-while-questioning-my-sexuality
bisexual,3d1kr2,HeadBandHalo,7,Mon Jul 13 12:17:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen too many relationships showing bi trans individuals with bi cis individuals. It's usually framed as a trans person coming out to their straight partner, or in more rare situations coming out to their gay or lesbian partner."
bisexual,3d1kr2,savbers,6,Mon Jul 13 03:46:50 2015 UTC,Bisexuals argue less about their sexuality with other bisexuals.
bisexual,3d1kr2,alicevirgo,10,Mon Jul 13 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"Bi people can be in a polyamorous or monogamous relationships.  Maybe the relationship between bisexual and asexual? A lot of people think they are opposite each other and therefore always clash.  Also, romantic orientation vs. sexual orientation (and their non-existent relation to gender identity)."
bisexual,3d1kr2,bunnylover726,2,Mon Jul 13 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"My brother is asexual and I'm bisexual, so we've talked about this. We came up with an idea- rather than draw the Kinsey Scale as 0-6 and X, we draw it as an x-y Cartesian coordinate plane. We put attraction to men or women on the x axis and level of sexuality on the y axis. So on the top of the y-axis would be really sexual people like myself, in the middle would be demisexuals, and at the bottom would be asexuals. It's a very imperfect tool, but we've used it to get the point across to people that asexuality vs. demisexuality vs. the rest of us is a spectrum, not a bunch of neat little boxes. This graphic is also pretty helpful."
bisexual,3d1kr2,bunnylover726,5,Mon Jul 13 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"How so many of us fear that we ""aren't really bi"". I repressed it for a long time, and my family is very homophobic, so I don't have a ton of experience with women (I'm a woman). Of course, people (and the nagging doubts in my mind) love to tell me that that means that I must be straight. I'm dating a bi guy, and he outright said ""I'm not sure if I really qualify as bisexual or if I'm just so hypersexual that the gender of my partner doesn't matter to me."" This is a guy who has history with men and women and whose dating profile had said he was looking for either a man or a woman or a non-binary person.   I wish I had the time and platform to write an essay myself, but I'll give you a writing prompt that you don't have to feel compelled to use. There's something called the ""No true Scotsman"" logical fallacy. Here's a youtube video that explains it a little more clearly than the wiki article.   You could practically call it (or an essay on the topic) ""The no true bisexual fallacy"". Basically it works like this- someone says ""bisexuals must be sexually and romantically attracted equally to men and women."" Someone tells them ""my friend is bisexual but she prefers men"", and the original person retorts ""then they're not a true bisexual.""   Think of all the qualifiers people put on us to ""prove"" our orientation. I think it's because they're afraid that they might be bi, so they impose a bunch of qualifications to reassure themselves that they can't possibly be bisexual. On that note, you could also (for a serious/difficult piece, definitely not required) dig into the reasons why people seem to think that all bi men are actually gay, and the self-fulfilling prophecy that it has created. (Bi men who lean straight afraid to come out for fear of women not dating them, so people see fewer bi men who end up with women.)   Hope that helps and isn't too tough to dig into- I look forward to reading your stuff! :D"
bisexual,3d1kr2,girlboygirlboy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"I love this so much. Thank you for sharing. I know all these feelings too well and was terrified I wasn't a ""true"" bisexual whenever my attraction to women started to wane. (I thought I was just gay). I will absolute write about this!"
bisexual,3d1kr2,keshanu,6,Tue Jul 14 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned the concept of sexual fluidity yet. Understanding that there can be times when you feel more attracted to the same gender and times when you feel more attracted to the opposite gender helped me quite a lot with coming to terms that I'm bi. It doesn't indicate that being bi is ""just a transition"" or ""curiosity"" or stuff like that. It's pretty normal and that is great :D"
bisexual,3d1kr2,turtles172002,2,Mon Jul 13 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"So much this! The fluid nature of my sexuality is a big reason it took me so long to come to terms with my bisexuality. I was so afraid of confirming the stereotype of ""women who say they are bi are just straight women who want attention"", that I freaked out every time my interest in women waned, thinking that I was actually straight and was unintentionally trying to get attention. Which is odd in hindsight, considering how I didn't dare tell anyone about my attraction to other women back then."
bisexual,3d1kr2,keshanu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"My husband has known about my bisexuality for about 13 years. Within the last couple years I told him that I don't really think I'm bi. Now, it's a complete 180. Until recently, I had no idea that it was normal to change over time. I basically had to come out to him again. And now I realize, this is who I am, who I always have been and who I always will be. My attractions may vary over time, and that's ok."
bisexual,3d1kr2,techn0path,0,Tue Jul 14 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear that you learned to accept it. It is so important, but it took me a while to learn that too."
bisexual,3d1kr2,Bethfy,2,Tue Jul 14 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"How about some articles on the determination of the people in the bi community to change their self or the community. Like kids who were told they wouldn't amount to anything and turned out to make something of themself.  Coming out stories would be cool, I'd like an ask question,but on a fun side maybe like a how do you show your pride, what did you learn today or what a bout the bi of the month (award to someone of the bi community who either shows  off their pride really well or some one who has overcome a traumatic event and still stayed positive.  One more idea what if you had an anonymous poster who talked about the bi lifestyle. Topics ranging from all over the place. One could be nightlife, dinning , dating, sex, shopping,dressing,ect the list goes on forever."
bisexual,3d1kr2,purpleblossom,2,Mon Jul 13 14:31:58 2015 UTC,Add some positive/quirky articles/events to brighten everyone's day. There is an understandable amount of negativity due to our struggles as a minority group. Some optimism would help ease the struggles.
bisexual,3d3x8a,FSRALGBTQI,3,Mon Jul 13 09:16:04 2015 UTC,"Done!  I feel like there were one or two typos there, by the way."
bisexual,3d3x8a,Cpnths,3,Mon Jul 13 13:49:03 2015 UTC,"Here they are specifically:  First page- asks about after I came out to my family. I’m not out to my whole family, so I feel that should have a “not applicable” or “not out to family” option to ensure accurate data. My brother and sister are very supportive of my orientation, but the one parent that I am out to is not. The parent that I am out to and the rest of the extended family (not out to them either) are not, so I answered for the majority.   On the “social connectedness” page, it says “I catch myself loosing a sense of connectedness with society.” It should be “I catch myself losing a sense of connectedness with society.”  On the “Social Behavior Inventory – Self-Esteem” page, the statement “I am a good mixer” isn’t perfectly clear. I took it to mean “I am good at mingling with other people”, but it could be more clear in a future survey. (Or maybe it's just me).  On the “Social Wellbeing” page, it felt a little odd that some of the statements switched between a first person and second person subject. Not sure if that was intentional, I have no expertise in psychology whatsoever. (Engineer here)  On the “Social Wellbeing” page, it says “You see society as continually involving” and I’m guessing it should say “You see society as continually evolving.”  EDIT: From one researcher to another, I wish you the best of luck with collecting good data :D"
bisexual,3d3x8a,bunnylover726,2,Mon Jul 13 15:47:12 2015 UTC,Upvote for helpful patience.
bisexual,3d3x8a,Cpnths,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"Done, but I do have a few questions.  Are there base metrics which you compare the survey data against?  What were the criteria for putting extra focus on certain categories of questions (i.e. self-esteem vs. Quality of life)?  Why did only a few question sets have a neutral answer option?  Finally, will this be broken down individually by sexual orientation, by gender, by location, or a combination?"
bisexual,3d1n1v,hybbprqag,7,Sun Jul 12 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"I totally get this post lol. I mean I have queer friends, but we're not all in some big squad or anything. When people around here say ""the LGBT community"" I think about my university's Rainbow Alliance (a club), since that's the closest thing I've experienced to an LGBT community. I stopped participating in it fairly quickly though, it was way too cliquey for me."
bisexual,3d1n1v,OutOfTine,3,Mon Jul 13 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"One of the better things my mentor (psych research focused on LGBTQ individuals) has suggested that I've definitely taken to heart is the idea that ""LGBTQ communities"" is probably a more accurate label for how LGBTQ folks come together in the US, particularly on the monosexual ends of the spectrum.   That being stated, when I think of the ""LGBTQ community"", like /u/OutOfTine, I think of my University's queer student center, as well as pride, drag events, and LGBTQ folks coming together to rally behind social issues that we either hold in common or are sympathetic to given our own statuses as sexual/gender minority people (despite the incredibly frustrating infighting that goes in our ""community"" at large)."
bisexual,3d1n1v,Phandango92,3,Mon Jul 13 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"It's a weird misnomer. It refers to one of four things.  1) Any particular group of queer people. E.g., the phrase, ""the LGBT community benefits from laws that legalise same-sex marriage"".  It is, as you note, weird to refer to this as 'a community', because it's really a set of communities, or even just individuals. I tend to reply to replace this phrase with ""many LGBT+ people"", as in, ""Many queer people benefit from laws that legalise same-sex marriage"".  2) All queer people. E.g., the phrase, ""the LGBT community suffers from homophobia"".  Again, this is a bit of a weird construction. It's not a single community, and it's not homogeneous. I tend to say, ""all queer people"" or ""almost all queer people"" if it's actually an experience which is fairly homogeneous over all queer people. ""Almost all queer people experience homophobia"".  3) An actual community, which is usually described as the 'gay community'. E.g., ""night clubs, like the ones on Canal Street in Manchester, are an important social venue for the LGBT community"".  This is another weird construction, although probably the least weird usage of the term in existence. I think it implies that this community is more welcoming than many of us have experiences of. Even so, this at least makes sense.  4) LGBT rights organisations. E.g., ""The LGBT community has welcomed an ending on the ban on MSMs donating blood"".  This is another weird construction, because it implies all queer people support our activist class. Firstly, not all women are feminists, and whilst I think they should be, it's actually quite rude to assume they are. Equally, not all queer people are supports of queer liberation, and it's rude to assume they are. Secondly, because even if we support the general concept of queer liberation, we don't necessarily support each group people.  I would replace this phrase with 'LGBT rights organisations'."
bisexual,3d1n1v,djb_thirteen,3,Mon Jul 13 11:28:26 2015 UTC,"Umm I believe we/ they refer to organizations, set up or lgbtqp as a mass."
bisexual,3d1lmz,glasgowstudent2,14,Sun Jul 12 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer the question, being a guy, but I would (and have) dated a trans gay man.  I don't really see any problem with it. One thing I've noticed about dating trans people as a bisexual person is that, if it's early in the person's transition, they might worry about how I see them (which gender) Essentially wanting to be loved for the right thing."
bisexual,3d1lmz,VDRawr,5,Sun Jul 12 22:22:41 2015 UTC,Yeah same here. I am very very early
bisexual,3d1lmz,VDRawr,7,Sun Jul 12 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would assume it's a pretty common insecurity. It kind of makes sense.  For what it's worth, while I can't talk for every bi person out there, I can safely say that for me, that's never been an issue. If someone tells me which gender they are, even if it mismatches a bit with some things I see, they're still the gender they said, and that's the part I care about. Maybe it comes with just not caring that much about my partner ls gender. Since it doesn't matter to me much, I can accept whatever they say as true."
bisexual,3d1lmz,ahatmadeofshoes12,4,Sun Jul 12 22:47:01 2015 UTC,Aww that is cute. I am hoping to transition fully though
bisexual,3d1lmz,frellingaround,6,Sun Jul 12 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"My attraction is more based on the individual than it is on anything else. If she was attractive to me and have a cool personality I wouldn't really care if she were cis or trans. None of that really makes a difference. I'm pretty flexible when it comes to genitals too and wouldn't really care if my partner had genitals that matched her orientation or not.  I'm just attracted to sexy people, that includes people of different genders and sis or trans doesn't really matter.  I think the only thing that would give me pause is if she were early on in transition and were dealing with crippling insecurity as a result of the major life changes. I have a lot of trans friends and many of them go through a stage kind of like this. I don't know if I could deal with that kind of insecurity, but that is not unique to trans people. I don't think I could date a cis person who was dealing with major insecurity either. I have been attracted to trans people who are past that stage though and I would date somebody who was secure with themselves whether they were cis or trans"
bisexual,3d1lmz,HeadBandHalo,6,Mon Jul 13 00:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course, if we were interested in each other and otherwise compatible.  I have trouble grasping the non-bisexual perspective on this topic.  I can respect that other people feel differently than I do, of course, but I honestly can't imagine what it would feel like to have a problem with this."
bisexual,3d1lmz,Ta2d_Kate,5,Mon Jul 13 01:23:34 2015 UTC,I'm a bi-trans girl and I would date another bi/trans girl or a bi/straight trans guy for that matter. Just no straight girls or gay guys because that would demean my identity
bisexual,3d1lmz,ThatKaylaPerson,4,Mon Jul 13 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"I mean....probably...It would depend on the person.  Personally, I try not to judge people on external stuff.  I know that sounds pretentious as hell, but I feel it's about what's on the inside."
bisexual,3d1lmz,alicevirgo,4,Sun Jul 12 21:18:03 2015 UTC,Thank you
bisexual,3d1lmz,TheLonelySamurai,3,Sun Jul 12 21:42:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bisexual girl here, and honestly, I would say that what matters the most to me is if we get along, same likes, personality, that sort of thing. Their gender has little do with it. Some might like it, it's all up to that person's preference of course. They're allowed to like and not like some things. But honestly, I would like to think that a good amount of people within the LGBT community, at least heavier in the female side of that, would be open minded to it.   But to answer the second question, yes, I would date a transgender lesbian. Honestly, as long as they were able to put up my dorky attitude and weird shit, then I would be up for it.   Have no fear. It's hard to follow that advice, but really, there is always someone for someone."

Trans lesbians are the most attractive in my opinion (though I do have feelings for any combination of cis/trans people).  I would date a trans lesbian if I was single.  Edit: forgot to mention if I would date. :P
bisexual,3d1lmz,TheLonelySamurai,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"Bi cis woman here. I would certainly date a trans lesbian.

bisexual,3d1lmz,PoseidonOfTheSea,5,Wed Jul 15 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"Cis lesbian here. I get turned off by male genetalia penises, so I would highly prefer not to. If they were especially awesome personality wise and outright told me they were trans then I might be willing to work with them. However if they purposely withheld from telling me and I found out the hard way by getting a face full of noodles when I wanted tacos then I'd probably never want to speak to them again.  So just be honest :)  Edit: You wanted an answer as to why not, you got one, and you're downvoting me for it. This is why nobody likes to answer questions like this.  Edit 2: Weeew back in the positives! Thank you for respecting a point of view from the other side."
bisexual,3d1lmz,cheese93007,7,Mon Jul 13 00:55:55 2015 UTC,Wouldn't trans lesbian mean that they're now a lesbian? Therefore female?

bisexual,3d1lmz,Adezu,7,Mon Jul 13 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up that ""male genitalia"" is a cissexist term. If a trans woman has a penis that is her genitalia, not a man's."
bisexual,3d1lmz,Esoterria,3,Mon Jul 13 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the biological sexes, not genders. I am turned off by biologically male genitalia."
bisexual,3d1lmz,Adezu,13,Mon Jul 13 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"It's a distinction that is really shitty for trans people. How would you feel if you had a dick but otherwise lived and was recognised as a woman, and someone came along and was all ""oh I don't like male genitalia""  You could've simply said ""I'm not really into penis"", and left out associating that with cis men."
bisexual,3d1lmz,VDRawr,4,Mon Jul 13 02:26:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't care because I know they're not saying it with malicious intent. I get called a guy all the time and I honestly couldn't care less. It's not like they're telling me to go kill myself. Mistakes happen.    The whole trans cis drama is still a fairly new thing and we're all still trying to learn all the new terms and distinctions that do and don't offend people. It's a real minefield. I'm doing my best to try and get my point across without offending anyone but it's really difficult sometimes. I apologise if anyone got offended, but I thought it was obvious I had no offensive intentions."
bisexual,3d1lmz,TheLonelySamurai,10,Mon Jul 13 02:36:41 2015 UTC,It's not really new...  I appreciate that you're trying to learn but maybe the best way to do that is to listen when people point out less-than-great things that you're saying instead of justifying what you said.
bisexual,3d1lmz,PassionPitTime,-3,Mon Jul 13 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's new to me. I'm not about to fall to the ground grovelling and apologising and begging forgiveness for light-heartedly saying something that some people might take offence from. I'm justifying it because it because I thought this was supposed to be a discussion where we back up our thoughts and decisions with reasons. There weren't any answers against dating trans lesbians so I gave my point of view. I have no ill intent, it's your choice to be offended by what I say."
bisexual,3d1lmz,PassionPitTime,2,Mon Jul 13 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"You're obviously allowed your own aesthestic preferences, but you should probably keep in mind that what's on a cis guy, and what's on a trans woman are two different things.  I actually dated some straight women before I transitioned, and they were really confused when I told them to stop.  Its kind of why I started dating men instead.  I can at least tell them what they're doing wrong.  A cis woman, is most likely, going to have a LOT of terrible, inaccurate distortions of how it works, get way too rough, and make me want to stab myself in the eyes, and jump out the window.  So yeah, not the same at all really - aesthetic preferences aside.  Just saying.  Edit:  You can downvote if you want to, but that doesn't make it any less true.  On a neurobiological level, trans women's brains are wires completely differently than cis guy's.  That also affects THAT as well.  Of course, that's not why most Cis lesbians have a problem with trans women, usually.  That has more to do with promoting such lovely notions as cock = oppression and rape.  You promote sexist, patriarchal definitions of abuse as absolute - villifying people for their body parts in the process.  It's also why when old women rape & abuse male toddlers, no one cares.  The kid ""just got lucky and probably wanted it."" - while the female perpetrator gets no jail time, and the kid gets blamed for it.  The lesbian community is mired in the same hateful logic, that makes things like that a reality.  So hey - I understand your prejudice and misconceptions.  Its fine.  Just try to look past your learned hatred, to realize that trans women and Cis men are wired completel  differently on a biological level.  That's all I'm saying really."
bisexual,3d1lmz,bubblypink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:44:59 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I mostly fully agree with you, except for one thing. While it is true that men and women exhibit different brain patterns/configurations/whatever, the difference between a cis man and a cis woman is still relatively minor. Calling it ""completely different"" would be a gross exaggeration.  Furthermore, while trans men show the exact same brain configurations as cis men, the reverse is not true. Trans women are wired in a way that is closer to a cis women than a cis man, but is still measurably different.  Now, modern science does not know what impact these differences have, so this in no way means anything as to the validity of being trans or whatever, but it does make the statement ""Trans women and Cis men are wired completely differently on a biological level"" false, or at the very least, a gross exaggeration.  Not sure what the point of this post is, just correcting factually incorrect statements I guess. Don't mind me."

We are just too complex to fit a label or be just one thing on the spectrum of variations.  It would be good to tell your partner about your feelings and that might allow you or or you both to experiment and see how it feels for you to be with a woman or for you both to be in a 3some with a women. But the main thing is just be you.  You get one shot at life (at least that is what I believe) so give it your best effort at being who you are"

It sounds quite clear that you're some variety of bi, and you're currently happy with your partner.  No more information is needed!  In answer to a few of your points:   Is that ok? Is it ok to date a man and fantasize about a women pleasuring me with him watching?   Of course!  There is no rule book: if your bf is happy, and you're happy, who cares?   Im also worried that one day I will become totally gay and have to break up with my bf or even husband and I really really don't want to have to do that.   Unlikely.  People who like blondes and brunettes don't worry that they'll spontaneously stop liking blondes someday.  Too many bisexuals worry that their urges are going to morph and take over and destroy their relationships in some hypothetical future, like some kind of internal Hulk.  We're not mindless animals, with bodies just waiting to betray us.  Our situation is no different than a straight person wondering if they'll fall in love with someone new someday, or a happily childless person worrying that they'll want kids someday.  All of these are possible, but unlikely, and we all have to make choices based on the information at hand.  We've been given a gift, that we can love regardless of gender; panicking that it will spontaneously disappear is like a kid receiving a toy firetruck on Christmas, and all they do with it is worry that it will get broken.   I am utterly happy in this relationship, but I dont understand how thats possible if I am more turned on by women than men? (thats not to say that I dont find men attractive though!), because I am not fitting what the label says I should be.   Being more attracted to one gender than the other doesn't mean you can't be happy with your ""less preferred"" gender.  A 10/90 split on men vs. women doesn't mean you're barely compatible with all men, and super compatible with all women.  It means that you're fully compatible with only a few men, and fully compatible with a lot of women.  It's no different from having a preference for blondes, and meeting a brunette who rocks your world.  Male, female, whatever: you've met someone awesome, and you'd love them no matter their gender.  That's a good thing!  I think you're overthinking this, but I understand the desire to do so.  If it helps, I've heard attraction broken into 4 separate categories, and understanding the differences helped me a lot:   Emotional (who you want to talk/connect to) Sexual (who you want to have sex with) Sensual (who you want to kiss and caress) Aesthetic (who you want to look at)"
bisexual,3d2rgc,hyzenthlay1701,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"I am utterly happy in this relationship, but I dont understand how thats possible if I am more turned on by women than men?   From what I've read, there have actually been studies on women being aroused by different things. I believe there was one study where a bunch of women, who identified as mostly straight, were turned on by pictures of women, lesbian sex, and even monkey sex - but they were not turned on by pictures of naked dudes.  Personally, I think it's the media's way of hypersexualizing women that has programmed our subconscious to immediately connect a woman's body with erotic pleasure, so we become aroused when we see a hot lady on a commercial, music video, in a club, or wherever.   I get the same way too and although I prefer men over women in general, I am okay with acknowledging that I find women sexy and I even have wet dreams about them some times. But, and here's the big but - I am in love with my boyfriend and his personality, his touch, his voice, his smile, and his laugh and (obviously) his member all turn me on when we're having sexytime.   Sexuality isn't entirely based on arousal - it's based on so many other plateaus of attraction, and just because those plateaus aren't as obvious as sexual arousal, that doesn't mean they aren't just as important. Tell your boyfriend how you feel and reassure him he's the dude you want to be with."

However, coming out to your friend represents a certain level of trust in him and in the strength of your friendship. Making yourself vulnerable by sharing this side of yourself gives him the opportunity to show his friendship and acceptance of you, if he takes it. And being open with him creates the opportunity for a deeper friendship between the two of you.   I would just try to frame it as 'Hey, I want you to know this about me because I trust you and you're my friend, so I want to be myself around you.'   Then just answer any questions he has that you're comfortable answering. Good luck!"

bisexual,3cz7rl,RoachPowder,13,Sun Jul 12 15:56:58 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. Well, I see the flag simply being the total opposite of the colorful gay flag just as heterosexuality is seen as the total opposite of homosexuality. The monochrome subtext being negative makes sense, but seeing how many people think of alternative orientations as complicated/devious/weird/etc. I can see how the ""mundane"" and ""simple"" can be seen as positive. It is the safe default.   Also, I don't have much knowledge about LGBT stuff but if I'm not mistaken the hetero pride flag (or most straight pride stuff) is used as a response/opposition to gay pride mostly by conservative groups (there's a chance the designer was one as well), so It wouldn't be very insane to think being ""ordinary"" is seen as something good by them (think of it like corporation/office/law culture, where uniformity and the like is seen as good. Conversely, the same culture is seen by artists as dull and oppressive).  English is not my first language so I hope that text made sense."

I get that others actually believe this and it's their right and choice to do so. But it's extremely annoying to have someone else define my sexuality for me.   Also, that line of thinking is pretty insulting to many trans people. If they believe that bisexuality excludes trans people based on the concept of gender binary then they're saying that trans people don't fit into the gender binary when many of them absolutely do. Of course, there are people who are genderfluid or genderless but the gender binary itself allows for a wide range of characteristics at both ends, especially now. Being a ""woman"" today doesn't mean what it did 100, 50 or even 20 years ago. Are they insinuating that a trans woman doesn't have a place in the gender binary? Because I personally know several that most definitely do. And that was their goal in the first place.  Maybe this is wrong but it's what I think of every time someone brings that up."

Second is that biphobia is also perpetuated by pansexuals, queers, non bisexual trans and non-binary people, so how exactly does it effect those groups? The author did good pointing out bisexual trans and non-binary people being effected though.   Third, talking about gay and straight people's misconceptions of bisexuals being it's own point made no sense when it was touched upon in 3 other points, especially when they aren't effected by biphobia but perpetuate it more than any other groups.

Gay cis on trans guy is my favourite (so much good porn out there if you're willing to pay a bit unfff), no surprise since I am a bisexual trans guy. :) I also enjoy straight trans girl on trans guy porn where the girl is doing the penetrating, it reminds me of my current fwb situation (plus it's just hot). Trans girl on cis girl porn is awesome too.

I can stare at muscled young guys forever and love myself some gay-porn.   I have come to the conclusion of myself that I prefer men in a physical way, and I can enjoy their bodies more than women's. Mostly because it's easier to achieve the level of my desires in physical aspects for men (lower standards) than for women. That's mostly because the physical things I really enjoy (abs, muscles and face) are more frequently seen as I like in guys than in girls.   But in the end, I can only see myself having a relationship with a girl. I am attracted to girls' behavior, their attitude. Also their physique, but less than with men.

I like this division because when I'm intimate with someone, I don't tend to have images from porn pop into my thoughts, so I am more in the moment.

I love the idea of MMF threesomes, and here is a place where you'll see a lot of them but I just find that overall most of them just leave me cold. I've seen a few really hot ones over the years though.   This would never happen but I'd love to see a lot more bi play in regular mainstream porn.

bisexual,3d00r6,DLL72,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:47:42 2015 UTC,Tend to lean towards gay porn. I'm a bit more into girls than guys and I just tend to find more stuff that I like when viewing girl/girl porn. A lot of hetero porn seems to focus on male pleasure which is totally hot and all but for me it's easier to get off on something I can relate to the feeling of. if that makes sense.

I may be an oddity here, because until 2 years ago I completely identified as straight. The shift in my orientation happened rather suddenly (from about a 0.5 on the Kinsey scale to 2-2.5 over the course of a few months), and I'm still exploring and incorporating this new facet into my self-identity.  Porn was where I first noticed the shift happening. I have a hotwife/cuckold fetish, so it wasn't uncommon to stumble across a bit of guy-on-guy contact in my normal porn consumption, but I suddenly switched from being vaguely put off by it to intrigued to actively seeking it out. Then I began adding gay porn to my day to day porn consumption. Once I started actually having sex with guys IRL I was hooked.  I still lean primarily toward women, and my porn watching reflects this. I'd say probably half of what I watch is either straight or lesbian porn, 30% involves some amount of male bisexuality, and 20% is just men. My tastes seem to vary from day to day (some days I just want to stroke to hot women, and some days I'm all about cock), but that's a pretty good breakdown.  Something I've noticed is that my attraction to men is very context-dependent. Men in a non-sexual context don't catch my eye as easily as women do, but in an explicitly sexual situation (porn or IRL) the difference diminishes."

Why are they portraying a Latin-American looking woman as having a ""gender variant culture destroyed by colonists""? That's bullshit, the gender roles were strict as fuck!

He treated bisexuality in women like a pig to hopped up on porn would. He tweeted a long time ago about a specific, recent event demonstrating his homophobia, then later backpedaled, said he was bi, and apparently this was done to make up for his previous misstep. His wife cheated on him with multiple people at once and when he was asked he claimed an open relationship, but then later complained about not sealing the deal with anyone so it appears as if he has no intention of handling his situation.

I agree with his viewpoints on ""arbitrary"" diversity in a way, although it sounds like while he is good at explaining why it's okay, his actual follow-through isn't (treating bisexual women like a pig hopped up on porn would is just perpetuating the same tired stereotype that bisexual people are greedy). Having a character be gay simply to have them be gay isn't a bad thing. I think Kung Jin from Mortal Kombat portrays that well. He doesn't even explicitly say he's gay, you just figure it out through some unsubtle context clues (Liu Kang is homophobic, who would have guessed? :P), but he's an important character because he shows you don't need to focus on homosexuality in order to include it.  However, this guy seems to to conflate tokenism and arbitary representation, which are two different things. Not to mention it sounds like his home life is fucked up. :/"

He has ""completely"" transitioned, because he has the money to do it. He doesn't consider poorer trans men as completely transitioned because they don't have the money for surgeries.   The point is that he doesn't care about poor LGBT. It's the character being an asshole, not the author.  The gender variant culture one was definitely stupid (Although I don't actually know what culture they are referencing, I could be wrong).   The races are all different aren't they?

In my opinion, the person talking about welfare is black because 1) she's dark-skinned and has dreadlocks and 2) it's a common stereotype in the US that black people, especially black women, do things like have kids to abuse the system and make money while doing nothing. The woman who's tired of people assuming that she's  in the sex industry is most likely black or Asian because those are the two races most commonly stereotyped as being sex workers; she could even be trans because many trans women of color are profiled as sex workers. I already said why the third woman could be Native American, but she's probably Latin American because Latin Americans, especially Mexicans, are often accused of ""stealing"" American jobs. The last woman is probably black because 1) the hair! and 2) the war on drugs and the school-to-prison pipeline are issues that directly affect the black American population and contribute to the disproportionate number of black people in prison.

I addressed this in another comment, but my point is this: as a person of color, the fact that I don't know the specific race/ethnicity of each doesn't mean that I don't empathize with the different kinds of racism that other women of color have to face. Would I like it if there were black women on all of my favorite TV shows? Of course I would. But that's probably never going to happen.

But I will say this: I'm not saying that you don't what it feels like to be marginalized in general. I'm saying that you don't know what it's like to deal with being marginalized as a racial minority, as a non-white person. And of course I don't think that racial problems are the only problems that matter! But you're privileged. So am I. I'm privileged because I'm an American, am middle class, am in college, am cisgender, am able-bodied, come from a Christian family, etc. I'm marginalized because I'm black, I'm a woman, I'm bisexual, etc. You're marginalized because you're ""a financially poor, queer disabled trans guy who takes care of a mentally disabled younger sibling.""

But within the LGBT+ community, a marginalized group, the most privileged group of people are white, middle-to-upper-class able-bodied people because being LGBT is their only ""big worry (big worries being things like racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, etc.)."" Those people, just like the rest of us, have to deal with the fact that although they are marginalized in some aspects, they're still privileged in others.           You don't advocate by spitting on people, period, and that is what this comic is doing. It's basically singling out people who in all likelihood have felt extreme prejudice and pain due to being who they were (maybe one half of the gay couple was kicked out of his conservative Christian family for being gay, maybe the trans man was told he would never be a ""real"" man, maybe the lesbian was raped to ""correct"" her into being straight), and acting like these people are somehow in a position of extreme social power.           But all the people in this comic have felt extreme prejudice or pain for being LGBT! It's just that the non-white people have also felt pain for being LGBT and non-white, the poor person felt pain for being LGBT and living in poverty, and the disabled person felt pain for being LGBT and disabled. Relative to the non-white LGBT people, the disabled LGBT person and the poor LGBT person, the white, able-bodied, and middle-class LGBT people do have more social power.             A comic where all of these characters had been saying things like ""It's important to use my voice to help my brothers and sisters in the LGBT whose voice isn't nearly as heard as it should be!"" it should be about unity instead of drawing a line in the sand between people.           That's the whole point of this comic. The voices of the non-white, poor, and disabled LGBT are the voices that aren't heard nearly as much as they should be. The comic is supposed to serve as a cautionary tale: hearing people that are less fortunate than you talk about their problems and telling them to be quiet so you can live a happy and successful life is a bad thing, and we as the audience are supposed to read the comic and understand that we should listen to people if we're more privileged than them in some way.            Where did I ever state it was only white well-off people that made sacrifices? That's kind of my point.            You assumed that the white, middle-class, and able-bodied people were the only LGBT characters, and assumed that the the non-white, disabled, and poor people were all straight, and that the comic was made for straight people to ""spit on"" LGBT people.           I'm part of those ""further from equal"" people and I still hate this comic. It's not a reminder, it's presumptuous and hurtful. I'm not any of those people in the first three boxes, but I know people like that, and reducing them to a stereotype is like a snake eating his own tail.          Why is it presumptuous to remind privileged people that they have privilege? And the characters at the bottom are supposed to serve as examples of struggles that white, middle-class, able-bodied LGBT people don't have to face, not stereotypes that put all non-white, poor, and disabled people into specific boxes that they have to fill to be ""properly"" marginalized.           I don't want to be part of a movement that eats its own young the moment it judges they have some slim margin of vague ""privilege"".           Being privileged doesn't make you (the general ""you"") a bad person. You become a bad person when you hear people talking about what it's like to be marginalized and, when they ask you to listen, try to understand, and help them, tell them that they're ""whining"" or being ""too sensitive"" so you can stay comfortable. Again, that's what this comic and I are trying to say.              You just shit on me for that a couple lines above. Which is it? Either you accept me as a counter-voice and accept the fact that I fit the very definition of what a ""marginalized person"" is to you, or you don't.              You implied before that the dissenting voices in the comic were people who reveled in being outside the norm, and were ""spitting on"" the white, middle-class, and able-bodied LGBT people because the latter wanted to be normal. I said that they were dissenting because they felt like their problems (racism, ableism, classism) weren't being addressed adequately enough. Again, I say it can't be either-or: you're marginalized because you're poor, disabled, trans, etc, and you're privileged because you're a white man. You're both."
bisexual,3d0ch7,throwawaygonebi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"I addressed this in another comment, but my point is this: as a person of color, the fact that I don't know the specific race/ethnicity of each doesn't mean that I don't empathize with the different kinds of racism that other women of color have to face. Would I like it if there were black women on all of my favorite TV shows? Of course I would. But that's probably never going to happen. What's more important is having non-white characters that are realistic (i.e., not one-dimensional stereotypes), dynamic and interesting, and central to the story. The one-dimensional and one-sided representations of people of color are pervasive throughout our media and in our ideas about non-white people, and I'm happy that this comic at least makes an effort to address these issues and the things that contribute to them.   While I agree with you (actually bringing up black people in media, I just realized the other day that I cannot think of one black male bisexual character on TV, that bothered me, I wish there was a positive portrayal out there for bisexual men of African-American descent), most of my friends who fit into the ""racial minority"" field say overwhelmingly they would prefer seeing characters of their own ethnicity. Of course, I feel like the solution is to greatly diversify media, but I also know that is an extremely hard thing to implement from the bottom up, so unless cis, white, straight people get the hint, it ain't gonna happen. I just think being able to readily identify the people she's trying to portray would probably be nice for those who are aching for people to recognize them as more than stereotypes.   That's fair, I don't know what your economic situation is, but I included issues of classism and ableism because 1) they pertained to the comic, and 2) I knew that you were disabled, but I didn't know if you were middle-class or not. That being said, I put ""white"" first because you are white, and I was trying to point out that your comments were coming from a place of racial privilege.    I mean, with me it's kind of a sticky grey area if we're talking about privilege as it pertains to race. I look a bit like this guy, except the eyebrows are even more bushy. I'm definitely not like ""average white guy"", and people almost never assume I'm ""white"". Even if we disregard the very recent history of Italian people being marginalized racially in America, people don't assume I'm Italian (sometimes the Italian-American accent gives it away, as does the random Italian cursing, I will admit that, but unless someone happens to come across me in a store having an Italian Freakout, nobody looks at me as Italian). I'm in a very grey area, and I'm one of those people who tests each individual's perceptions of what ""white"" means to them. While I would never claim I'm racially profiled like say, an African-American person is, I have felt the racism of those who believe I'm Arab-American, or Pakistani-American, or the product of a white/Middle Easten union.  So, I can't honestly tell you if the average person would consider me racially privileged or not. I've certainly dealt with my fair share of people thinking I'm not the race I am, but I don't know how that translates directly or indirectly into getting shit for being correctly identified as the race you are. :/   But I will say this: I'm not saying that you don't what it feels like to be marginalized in general. I'm saying that you don't know what it's like to deal with being marginalized as a racial minority, as a non-white person. And of course I don't think that racial problems are the only problems that matter! But you're privileged. So am I. I'm privileged because I'm an American, am middle class, am in college, am cisgender, am able-bodied, come from a Christian family, etc. I'm marginalized because I'm black, I'm a woman, I'm bisexual, etc. You're marginalized because you're ""a financially poor, queer disabled trans guy who takes care of a mentally disabled younger sibling."" You're privileged because you're a white American man.   Ehh, again, see above. I don't know if people mis-identifying me falls into racism, or some sort of weird racism-by-proxy scenario, but I do think I've gotten a taste of what it is like to be profiled because people assume I'm non-white. Mediterranean people are a touchy issue for a reason amongst some people, a lot of us are extremely racially ambiguous, and we can end up looking Latino/Latina, Arab-American, and at the extreme end of the scale some of us end up even looking like we're mixed race/African-American. I find that a lot of people have a very narrow view of what ""Italian-American"" looks like."

So, I can't honestly tell you if the average person would consider me racially privileged or not. I've certainly dealt with my fair share of people thinking I'm not the race I am, but I don't know how that translates directly or indirectly into getting shit for being correctly identified as the race you are.            Let's look at it this way: say we have you, an Italian-American who ""passes"" for an Arab-American, and a half-black, half-white person who ""passes"" for white. Say a group of people regards you with suspicion because they believe that you're Arab. They ask you what your ethnicity is, and when you say that you're Italian they look surprised and relieved. They say, ""Oh, I thought you were Middle Eastern!"", laugh, and maybe even apologize. They're friendlier to you afterwards. In the biracial person's case, someone from that same group will ask they what their ethnicity is and they'll say, ""Oh, I'm Danish on my dad's side and my mom is  black."" That same group might stop and say, ""Oh...you're black? You didn't tell me and act like they've been deceived. They might still friendly with the biracial person, but the relationship will be more distant than it was before. My point is, the racism that you encounter is racism-by-proxy because people are reacting to a race that they think you are, not the race that you actually are. They're not reacting negatively to the identity that you have personally. You can say that you're Italian-American and all that negativity will go away. You can still identify as white whenever you're asked the ""race question"" on any form and not be ""deceitful."" If a policeman racially profiles you, you can pull out your driver's license or state ID card and when they look at your name, they'll be relieved that you're not what they thought you were and send you on your way. That's what it means to have racial privilege, and you have it."

I'm happy when gay characters are on TV, even though I'm not gay. I'm happy when lesbian characters are on TV even though I am neither a woman nor a lesbian. I'm happy to see when characters are diverse racially. But, like I mentioned before, like my friends, I'm overwhelmingly happy when I find characters that speak to a core part of my identity. I actually cried when I found a well-written romance novel featuring a gay cis man and a bisexual trans man. I freaked the fuck out. It was amazing, from having the cis man be gay (there are people who argue that only bisexual people are willing to date pre-/non-op trans men, and I think that's bullshit), to having the trans guy being bisexual and non-op, I loved it. I can only imagine that other marginalized people feel the same way I did when I discovered that, and that makes me push for distinct representation in media, instead of just ""ambiguous brown people"" or ""ambiguously not straight"".   You can still identify as white whenever you're asked the ""race question"" on any form and not be ""deceitful.""

I've never felt ""white"", I always answer ""other"" on forms, and I know a lot of other people of Mediterranean descent who do as well. If you speak to a lot of Italian-Americans, we're not fully over the racial divide barrier yet, even though some people think we are. Contrary to what you seem to think, Italian-Americans do get shit on. Once I have correctly identified myself, people don't automatically wipe their brow and go ""phew!"", I've gotten sneers and heard shit like ""Oh, so you're not a terrorist you're a wop instead"". A facet of white privilege is tied to what people think you are, and how others perceive you. I can tell people I'm of Mediterranean descent all day and even though it might be considered a ""sub-section"" of ""white"", there are plenty of people who feel that it's a division worth noting, both for the good and the bad. I've never identified with dominant ""white culture"", and my racial identity is extremely tied up in what it means to be a Italian-American from southern Italian origins. While I would never say I experience racism in quite the same way as a black person, or a true Arab-American, etc, I definitely don't feel much ""privilege"" with concerns to race."

bisexual,3d0ch7,throwawaygonebi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:18:17 2015 UTC,"PART 2 (Yeah I had to split it up, I apologize, I went over the Reddit max character limit.)   Like I said, everyone has a mixture of privileges and marginalizations. But within the LGBT+ community, a marginalized group, the most privileged group of people are white, middle-to-upper-class able-bodied people because being LGBT is their only ""big worry (big worries being things like racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, etc.)."" Those people, just like the rest of us, have to deal with the fact that although they are marginalized in some aspects, they're still privileged in others.    I agree with this.   But all the people in this comic have felt extreme prejudice or pain for being LGBT! It's just that the non-white people have also felt pain for being LGBT and non-white, the poor person felt pain for being LGBT and living in poverty, and the disabled person felt pain for being LGBT and disabled. Relative to the non-white LGBT people, the disabled LGBT person and the poor LGBT person, the white, able-bodied, and middle-class LGBT people do have more social power.    I also agree with this. Like I said in the other comment, it's not about the underlying message, it's about how they got it across. Painting white, middle-class LGBT people as the ""villain"" of the comic was a poor choice in my opinion. Comics about issues like this should have no ""villain"", especially when you're dealing with people who are all relatively low on the social-power ladder. Saying to a cis white gay woman ""you have privilege"" may not mean an awful lot if that woman still faces crap daily for being who she is. I feel like this comic has an overly optimistic view of how gay and lesbian people are viewed in American society. :/   That's the whole point of this comic. The voices of the non-white, poor, and disabled LGBT are the voices that aren't heard nearly as much as they should be. The comic is supposed to serve as a cautionary tale: hearing people that are less fortunate than you talk about their problems and telling them to be quiet so you can live a happy and successful life is a bad thing, and we as the audience are supposed to read the comic and understand that we should listen to people if we're more privileged than them in some way.    I agree, but again, it's mainly the tone of the comic I take issue with, not the underlying message.   You assumed that the white, middle-class, and able-bodied people were the only LGBT characters, and assumed that the the non-white, disabled, and poor people were all straight, and that the comic was made for straight people to ""spit on"" LGBT people.    Wait, what? Maybe I worded something wrong. I didn't assume the only people who are LGBT were the white, middle-class, able-bodied people. Two of the people are stating issues that pretty much only affect marginalized LGBT people (being kicked out of homeless shelters for your sexuality, queer women of colour being accused of wanting to adopt children for welfare reasons). No, the ""spitting on"" I feel is being done by two different marginalized peoples caught on the bottom two rungs of the social power ladder. I feel like the comic is pitting people who are marginalized in general against one another.   Why is it presumptuous to remind privileged people that they have privilege? And the characters at the bottom are supposed to serve as examples of struggles that white, middle-class, able-bodied LGBT people don't have to face, not stereotypes that put all non-white, poor, and disabled people into specific boxes that they have to fill to be ""properly"" marginalized.    I mean...I don't know, I guess I'd feel funny looking at a middle-class cis gay white dude and being like ""Just so you know, you have more social power than I do."" It feels strange to bring 'privilege' into a conversation where everyone is feeling the effects of oppression. It's the same uncomfortable feeling I get when trans women and trans men get into fights about ""who has it worse"". Nobody really has it ""worse"" in the end because it's all very subjective and we face very different problems that can't be quantified into a check/minus system. That's how I feel about stuff like this.  And I guess I feel this artist doesn't do a very good job at making people 'examples' instead of stereotypes. They've done other comics I'm not into either. I just don't like their bristly way of explaining things.   Being privileged doesn't make you (the general ""you"") a bad person. You become a bad person when you hear people talking about what it's like to be marginalized and, when they ask you to listen, try to understand, and help them, tell them that they're ""whining"" or being ""too sensitive"" so you can stay comfortable. Again, that's what this comic and I are trying to say.    Again, I do agree with this, I just feel like this comic doesn't go about things the right way.   You implied before that the dissenting voices in the comic were people who reveled in being outside the norm, and were ""spitting on"" the white, middle-class, and able-bodied LGBT people because the latter wanted to be normal. I said that they were dissenting because they felt like their problems (racism, ableism, classism) weren't being addressed adequately enough. Again, I say it can't be either-or: you're marginalized because you're poor, disabled, trans, etc, and you're privileged because you're a white man. You're both.   What I meant by ""counter-culture"" was that the artist deliberately drew all of the ""extra marginalized"" people in a very...distinct way. The shaved undercut. The piercings. The dyed hair. The punk look. The hippie look. It's all very ""I'm visibly not like other people"" counter-culture. That's what I meant, not that someone would personally revel in being marginalized or considered 'not normal'.  Again, I'm not so positive about the ""white"" part, but I suppose you could say I'm privileged because I am a man. Although that's dubious too. I ""pass"", but I'm very open about being trans, so my privilege as a man is dependent entirely upon me keeping my mouth shut. I'm privileged in other ways though, and I'll readily admit that. I've got a mother and grandmother who love me, who were supportive both of my bisexuality and transsexuality. I'm not homeless. I have a roof over my head. I have enough money for things like internet connection, small hobbies, etc. There are also other ways in which I'm marginalized, as a childhood sexual abuse survivor, as the child of a single mother, etc. Everyone's life is most definitely a system of being privileged in some areas and marginalized in others. I think listening to others would solve about 90% of our problems though. I think racism and classism and sexism are things we absolutely need to talk about, both ways, but I think buckling down and being serious and courteous is the way to go when talking about these things, and I just don't feel like this artist does that."

Trans man privilege is about as fragile as a Faberge egg, because it concerns being ""male"" in a society that is very quick to call me out about not being a real one. The privilege rung would go ""cis male>cis female>trans male>trans female"". A very large part of society bases manhood on genitals, of which mine don't fit the bill. Other people consider even completely post-op trans people as ""living a lie"". If you ask trans women, they usually feel much the same way.

White trans women may be marginalized because they're trans and women, but that doesn't make them any less white. They still have racial privilege.

The ""Latin-American looking woman"" is probably Native American. Latin American countries were populated by Native Americans before they were mostly killed by white Spanish conquistadors, who brought in Christian, patriarchal gender norms. I'm not sure how many Native American groups had more than two genders, but a good amount of them did.             I say that as a bisexual trans man who is medically disabled.

Quite a fucking lot, shit if you ever heard of Dia de los Muertos it's heavily stooped in indigenous tradition. Many Latino people have indigenous ancestry.   Oh and before you go ""my appropriation"" modern society has been the result of cultural exchange for milennia, and to claim that this is bad would be tantamount to calling mankind and  all its interactions an error.

But the term ""mestizo"" itself was made to fit into a racial hierarchy that existed after Latin America became racially mixed: white people at the top, white-and-native people in the middle (the mostly-white ""castizos"" closer to the top and biracial/mostly native ""mestizos"" closer to the bottom), then Native Americans, then multiracial people who had black ancestors, then black people. So even that word has a racist past. And I know that a lot of traditions come from indigenous culture. Indigenous people are part of their countries - that's why their families are indigenous to the region. The reason I assumed that one of the people was Native American was because she was talking about ""colonists,"" and who would be more affected by colonists than an indigenous person?          And by the way, I don't believe that cultural exchange is bad in and of itself. It gets bad when a dominant, more powerful group (ex: white Americans) takes cultural elements from a less powerful group (ex: non-white Americans) and uses it in a way that's disrespectful, without regard to where that element comes from, and/or at the less powerful group's expense.

I'm presuming the disabled guy/girl/androgynous person is some form of queer, but for the most part I think they were pretty much hammering home ""a different marginalization per person"". I can't be sure, but we're also working with extremely limited information, and I don't have access to the artist's notes telling me that the guy in the wheelchair is disabled, Asian-American, is gay and poor, or that the trans woman is a black trans woman of colour who is also a lesbian.   What's so idealized or impossible about expecting people to care about issues that don't directly affect them?   Because this comic is presenting equal marriage as this weird ""perfect world"" ideal, when in reality it is far from it. No one is saying people shouldn't care about issues that don't directly affect them, but this isn't the way to do it."
bisexual,3d0ch7,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:54:09 2015 UTC,"It feels like a cheap shot when taken in context with the rest of the comic. It feels like playing minority bingo, and yeah, sorry I guess maybe that's a ""white"" thing to say but as someone who genuinely cares about marginalized groups I don't like feeling like it's okay for a comic artist to use difference ethnicities to hammer her point home as long as it's a ""positive"" message. A stereotype is a stereotype. It also feels like this comic is stripping nuance from extremely complicated subjects.           Stereotypes of a particular group aren't all the same. To use women, as an example, all women's sexuality is limited by our society but not all women have the same limits: white women are stereotyped as either the ""girl next door"" who's ""innocent,"" or the ""party girl"" who has sex but isn't respected; black women are stereotyped as being ""party girls"" by nature because blackness is associated with savagery; and Asian-American women are stereotyped as being demure, mysterious, and submissive because Asian-Americans aren't seen as ""real"" Americans, and Asians in general are seen as very feminine, weak, and cerebral in our society. The stereotypes and their effects on various women might be different, but they all come from the same place: misogyny and racism.            It also feels like this comic is stripping nuance from extremely complicated subjects. (Also, I would argue that racial privilege doesn't mean much when you're a visibly trans woman. Last I checked it was more of an issue of ""than ""man"" is trying to become a woman!"")            What's more nuanced than saying, ""There are hierarchies even within marginalized groups,"" or ""You can be marginalized in one aspect of your life and privileged in another?"" This is still true even when it comes to trans women: for example, around the same time that Leelah Alcorn's suicide was discussed in national news outlets, multiple trans women of color who worked as sex workers (this isn't true. Please see my edit!) had been murdered, and the only talk of it was online. I would never dream of saying that Leelah Alcorn's suicide was unimportant or that discussion of it should never take place, but it was seen as being more important/""marketable"" than the murders of trans WoC for a reason.            I still have no idea what this person is. If I were part of the group she was trying to represent I'm sure I would have enjoyed being able to readily identify myself.          On some level that's true, but at least the concerns of LGBT women of color are being addressed in some way. At least the author is still trying to tell the audience that people can face multiple kinds of problems, and that a true community would try to address them to the best of its ability. It's not perfect, but it's not a one-dimensional stereotype and it speaks to me as a non-white person.           Eh, it all depends on your definition of ""white"". I'm not stereotypically white-passing as my family comes from southern Italy, with the olive skintone and the prominent features typical of Mediterranean people. People usually think I'm the product of some sort of Middle Eastern mix with my dark bushy eyebrows and facial structure.           Ok, so you have a hint of what it's like to be a non-white person, but that's not the whole picture. People may ask you ""what you are,"" but  as soon as you say ""I'm Italian!"" they most likely go ""Oh, okay,"" and that's the end of it. In other words, you get Othered for a little while, but as soon as you can affirm that you're white you're back in the dominant group again.           Still, I don't quite know why that would matter. My ethnicity, even if people thought I was a blonde, blue-eyed Swedish guy, doesn't cancel out all the other shit. How do I not know that the protesters aren't gay and lesbian?

Ok, to tell you why I know all the people in this comic are queer I'm going to have to tell you what this comic is about. Please note that here, I'm trying to be thorough, not condescending: 1) The title is ""How Saying 'We're Just Like You' Works Against the Queer Community. This comic is focusing on the queer community as a whole. 2) Who is the ""you"" in ""We're just like you""? The people who create our ideas of what's ""normal"": rich/middle-class straight white people. The LGBT people at the top of the comic are the queer equivalent of the American Dream: they're middle-class and white. The people who don't fit into this Dream - people who are non-white, poor, disabled, etc. - can't access this dream, and are asking to be considered important even if they can't be ""normal."" 3) The white, middle-class, and able-bodied people stomping on the dissenting voices are saying that now that they've achieved their American Dream, they don't want to take the time to help other, less privileged people do the same. It's a signal to the people reading this comic that they shouldn't be so selfish, that they should care about things that don't directly affect them and help others even when it's not to their direct benefit. That's why it matters that you're white: it may not cancel out everything else that you have to deal with, but it still gives you help that someone else might not have access to.              EDIT: I'd like to apologize for some things that I said earlier: I believed that the trans woman who were murdered were sex workers. I'd misread an article that was criticizing a journalist for speculating that a trans woman who'd been murdered was a sex worker, and although my intentions were good I ended up doing the same thing as the journalist and being the kind of person that one of the dissenting voices in this very comic was talking about. I apologize to everyone that read my earlier comments."

The stereotypes and their effects on various women might be different, but they all come from the same place: misogyny and racism.    I do agree that there are things unique to each subsection of marginalized people, I guess I just don't think that comics like these are the way to go about it. In my experience people shut down when they think you are trying to better yourself by taking a pot-shot at them, and I can imagine there are a lot of white, middle class gay and lesbian people who feel like they've been picked at because of that comic. (Also, for the record I don't agree at all with the artist including a straight trans man--I feel the ""man"" bit was deliberate too instead of it being, say, a straight trans woman, feminists have a bit of a shitty history of ignoring the fact that trans men face a lot of very specific problems due to being trans men.) I think the issues that face minorities and marginalized people are extremely important, but they're also extremely nuanced, and not something you can tackle with a short comic like this. I say this mainly because I understand how a lot of marginalized people feel. A very dear friend of mine (ex-fwb, we would probably have ended up in a serious romantic relationship, but he had to move for his job) is an Asian guy. One of our biggest topics of conversations is how racist the gay community is towards Asian men. He didn't fit into any of the stereotypes laid out for him. He was 5'9'', he hit the gym regularly, he had a close-cropped beard (i.e. he wasn't a fem), he was a top and not a bottom, he wasn't all that knowledgeable about his Japanese ancestry or the history/language of Japan. So, these are issues that affect people close to me, and I feel it. I just don't think the answer is to divide and conquer.   What's more nuanced than saying, ""There are hierarchies even within marginalized groups,"" or ""You can be marginalized in one aspect of your life and privileged in another?"" This is still true even when it comes to trans women: for example, around the same time that Leelah Alcorn's suicide was discussed in national news outlets, multiple trans women of color who worked as sex workers had been murdered, and the only talk of it was online. I would never dream of saying that Leelah Alcorn's suicide was unimportant or that discussion of it should never take place, but it was seen as being more important/""marketable"" than the murders of trans WoC for a reason.    This I actually disagree with. I don't think it was racism, I think it was classism. There's a reason why you never hear of white trans women who are sex workers and murdered being national news either. It's because trans sex workers in general are seen as the lowest of the low. But Leelah was a young girl whose cries for help resonated with people because it showed how vulnerable these young trans kids are. Blake Brockington, a black trans boy, had much the same reaction/coverage. He was a stunningly charming young man, attractive, prom king, people thought he was going somewhere bright...until depression got the best of him.   On some level that's true, but at least the concerns of LGBT women of color are being addressed in some way. At least the author is still trying to tell the audience that people can face multiple kinds of problems, and that a true community would try to address them to the best of its ability. It's not perfect, but it's not a one-dimensional stereotype and it speaks to me as a non-white person.    I guess. I mean, I think my main issue is with the overall derisive tone of the piece. Allies are an extremely important part of activism, and that doesn't change when the allies you're seeking out are marginalized in some way themselves. That's what bothers me. I wish the comic had been done in a more unifying way, because I don't think we should split ourselves up like that.   Ok, so you have a hint of what it's like to be a non-white person, but that's not the whole picture. People may ask you ""what you are,"" but as soon as you say ""I'm Italian!"" they most likely go ""Oh, okay,"" and that's the end of it. In other words, you get Othered for a little while, but as soon as you can affirm that you're white you're back in the dominant group again.    Maybe I don't hang out with people that care or something, because I can honestly say I've never felt ""othered"", even when friends have told me months down the line ""Wait, you're Italian? I thought you were like, half Arab or something."" The times I feel most othered are actually around strangers, which is what I imagine being non-white feels like. When people stare at you, that is when I feel othered. But most people are self-aware enough not to ask me five seconds after we meet ""So, what ethnicity are you?"", so I can say I haven't really experienced much of the above exchange of people sorting me mentally into different categories.   It's a signal to the people reading this comic that they shouldn't be so selfish, that they should care about things that don't directly affect them and help others even when it's not to their direct benefit. That's why it matters that you're white: it may not cancel out everything else that you have to deal with, but it still gives you help that someone else might not have access to.   Again, I agree completely with the underlying message, my main issue is how they chose to get that message across. I'm not fond of the tone of the comic. Lie I said, I think allies are important. It's why I don't deal with trans people who think ""down with cis"" is cute, or why I don't befriend people who think it's okay to be racist against white people, or people who think ""male tears"" is funny. I'm not into bettering myself by downing others, and I feel like portraying mainstream LGBT folks as oppressors is the wrong way to try and get this point across, and it just makes me sad because there is a valid point buried under there."
bisexual,3d0ch7,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, fair enough. At this point I'm just going to have to agree to disagree: I'm not trans, and I don't know enough about the nuances of trans issues to argue except to say that race and class can be extremely tied together, and I think that the mistreatment of trans women of color still has a lot to do with the ""worth"" assigned to non-white people in general. But I will ask: what exactly do you think marginalized LGBT people should do?"
bisexual,3d0ch7,throwawaygonebi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not trans, and I don't know enough about the nuances of trans issues to argue except to say that race and class can be extremely tied together   I do want to point out that trans and class can often be extremely tied too. Trans people of all races have trouble getting and keeping jobs, especially trans women. Trans issues are a huge area of intersecting issues, and yes, race can be one of them.   and I think that the mistreatment of trans women of color still has a lot to do with the ""worth"" assigned to non-white people in general   I'm not trying to be an asshole here, I'm actually really curious about this because I do think racism is still a problem: Is there a specific backlash against trans women of colour? I've only ever really seen transphobia in it's pure form, it never really seemed to single people out for being ""black and trans"" or ""latino and trans"". The race was never the issue, it was the fact that the person dared to be trans. I fully say that I could simply have not seen this which is why I'm asking.   But I will ask: what exactly do you think marginalized LGBT people should do?   I think you're mistaking my dislike of this comic with a dislike for the subject matter. I think marginalized LGBT people can continue to speak on the subject of the inequalities they face. I just don't agree with painting things in broad strokes like this. Alienating others is not how you get yourself heard. (For instance: The trans lady at the white house conference recently. Hard cringe. Was her underlying message sound? Yes, absolutely. Was the way she went about it the right way to do so? No.)"

bisexual,3d0ch7,throwawaygonebi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part with all of these articles. Being trans is a sticky web of intersectional privilege and oppression. For instance, trans men and trans women have very different problems. Trans women are more likely to face violence for being trans. Trans men are more likely to commit suicide. Trans women have the benefit of a huge media push in their favour, with visible trans superstars like Laverne Cox and Janet Mock. While trans men by contrast have barely any media coverage, and young trans men often don't even realize trans men exist until their late teens to early twenties, so they wallow in a dysphoric hell until they finally do a fateful internet search. Trans men are more likely to have their rapes disregarded, and labeled as male on female violence, with the trans man being the ""female"" in the equation. Trans men are privileged sometimes in the dating world, because trans women are heavily fetishized, to the point that ""trans"" to the average cis person means ""woman with a penis"". Trans men have a really big problem with erasure, so much so that we often have to fight within the trans community to have our voices heard.  So, I'm not really going anywhere with this, just trying to show anyone who happens to read this how much ""being trans"" encompasses a myriad of issues."

Now that they've gotten their assimilationist respectability of marriage and military service the rest of us can go to hell.  (To clarify, I have nothing against marriage or military service, if that's what you truly want from life. I just don't believe that queer activism should stop with assimilationist goals.)  If you're going to support any queer movement org, throw a few bucks or some time towards GetEqual. They work on queer and trans* immigrant issues, including asylum and detention abuses.

bisexual,3cxdf4,techn0path,27,Sat Jul 11 21:06:23 2015 UTC,"I struggle to understand it to. Not in a ""wow, how could you not be bi, it's so open minded!"" kind of way, but just that I don't understand it because I've never experienced it. I've run into issues discussing sexuality with people (particularly when talking about attraction to trans people, as there are plenty of ""I like trans women so I must be gay!"" guys out there) because I can't really grasp the experience of only being attracted to one gender. I try not to be judgmental, cause it's just as stupid as judging bisexuality. But no, you're definitely not alone!"
bisexual,3cxdf4,theaxolotlgod,14,Sat Jul 11 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't mean to imply any sort of 'enlightenment' or whatnot. It's just as I've become more mature and closer with more mature straight and lesbian/gay people, I realized that most people, regardless of orientation experience their sexuality both in terms of an attraction and some sort of non-attraction based on gender.  I never had really thought of the non-attraction part before."

I never had really thought of the non-attraction part before.   Yeah this is pretty much true for me.  I am somewhere near the gay end of the sexuality spectrum. I do experience some forms of attraction to people regardless of gender/sex- and at others their male sex/gender pushes me away.   I like the gender- neutral part of people, I am attracted to femininity and at times put-off by masculinity and maleness. In the past I could 'put up with it' if  I liked the person in other ways-but I was never attracted to it.  That is why I don't identify as bisexual."

bisexual,3cxdf4,SmaragdineSon,12,Sat Jul 11 21:51:04 2015 UTC,"When most straight people think of gay sex, they think of fat, hairy, middle-aged men. That's my experience.  Plus people are just biased. I had a friend who was openly gay though a certain group (they smoked, and not just tobacco, and did balloons - might give you an idea of what I mean) somehow failed to notice. He wasn't exactly hiding it. When they found out, their descriptions indicated they thought that he would see them as, and I quote, ""assholes on legs"". They were right, ironically, but not in the way that they meant."

bisexual,3cxdf4,vin_edgar,15,Sat Jul 11 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"as a hetero cis man, i think i can explain it (forgive me, some people in this thread seem to be earnestly saying they don't get it).  i learned the most about my sexuality while i was wondering ""hey, why aren't i bi?  i bet there are a lot of dudes that i could be interested in.""  the first hurdle is just the sex: the idea of being with a man, having anal sex, oral sex, even kissing, just doesn't feel right.  i have a natural flinch, the idea just feels uncomfortable.  i imagine it isn't too different from people who just aren't into kinks, for example.  like, i'm not into scat play, or BSDM; that's just not my thing.  but this doesn't explain why i have never had romantic feelings for a man.  i generally don't notice people in terms of their sexual attractiveness, they just have that ""butterflies in your stomach"" quality about them.  it just so happens that i only have that feeling when i look at women.  and at a certain point, i wondered ""why?"" and i would try to actively remind myself to notice men.  so on buses, in public situations, i would look at men and notice... nothing.  the same thing when i look at people who are much older than me: it doesn't matter their gender, they're just people, minus any potential for me to have feelings for them.  i can notice when they are well dressed and look sharp, but they don't have a romantic effect on me.  i'm still holding out hope on androgenous/non-binary people though."

I grew up in a really conservative home and wasn't introduced to the concept of bisexuality until late in high school.   For the longest time I just thought everyone found everyone beautiful but only had relationships with the opposite sex because family and babies and stuff. That's just how it is, right?   Then I found out that whole way of thinking was backwards.  Then I realised that some people are really and genuinely only attracted to the opposite sex.  I think I just came to a place, for the first time, where I really understand that I'm ultimately and truly different front heterosexuals.  Crazy.  Edit: so thank you for posting! :)"

Weird"
bisexual,3cxdf4,amethyst_specter,3,Sun Jul 12 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand any sort of sexuality. I couldn't articulate what it is that I like about boobs, I just see it as you're attracted to what you're attracted to. Just take any one person you're not attracted to and that's how monosexuals feel about a gender. It's really hard to understand anything related to attraction, you can say what you're attracted to but you can never really say why."
bisexual,3cxdf4,jchaosrs,3,Sun Jul 12 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"I was just talking about this very subject this morning. I had a  sudden realization that I do not really understand monosexuality or how it feels. But now I know how my straight and gay friends feel about being bisexual and why they don't really get it.  I honestly think that most straight people have a better understanding of homosexuality than bisexuality/pansexuality. Which could explain why its such an up hill struggle to get people to understand and accept that bisexuality/pansexuality is real and not ""just a phase""."
bisexual,3cxdf4,Blackbelt54,5,Sun Jul 12 02:04:02 2015 UTC,"I think for a question like this, monosexuality is a dangerous lens through which to analyse. This is because we live in a heteronormative society that gives a platform for different gender desires and represses same gender desires. So while I have a hard time believing that all straight people are straight, I have much less trouble believing someone is gay, since their desires are not allowed by our social structures"
bisexual,3cxdf4,greyspatter,7,Sat Jul 11 22:21:34 2015 UTC,"Straight/gay/bi are all completely valid sexual orientations. However I don't think anyone can truly be 100% only attracted to one sex with zero exceptions ever under any circumstances. Maybe 99.99995% attracted to guys, but there's always an exception no matter how tiny IMO. People are obviously able to identify however they want and that's valid though."

My brain always says ""That... that doesn't sound so gay to me.""  Obviously, I never say that, because what the fuck do I know. Who am I to say someone is classifying themselves in a way that doesn't make sense to me. That's even worse than people who say ""You spell your name wrong"". But it never fails to bemuse me."

Basically most people fall between either sides of bisexuality (straight or gay) even most bisexuals will tell you that, most people do not fall on any of the extremes. So, yes it's hard to believe that everyone is completely straight or gay."
bisexual,3cxdf4,zygocactus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"But not falling completely on any of the extremes, doesn't imply bisexuality either. Some people might have some flexibility in their attraction, but they are simply not wired to connect sexuality to people of one gender. As the woman in the thread on r/sex said of experimenting with women- 'it doesn't' feel like sex'- and I presume this will be the experience of monosexual people who have sex with those outside of their orientation- and many gay people who come out later after being in straight marriages also will probably also relate to that."
bisexual,3cxdf4,aoeui-dhtns,0,Sat Jul 11 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"Why do you need to understand it? Straight and gay and ace people don't understand us, but we can all still believe in each other.   I also think ""monosexual"" is not a good term. Gay and straight people don't identify as that, it's just what we call them to put them in a box together. And they are not really similar to one another; just ask them. Also, it creates this false binary between bi and mono people and leaves out aces and gender fluid people and so on… it's just such an arbitrary term."
bisexual,3cxdf4,zygocactus,-7,Sun Jul 12 09:02:52 2015 UTC,"haha-I am mostly gay and I don't really 'understand' heterosexuality- for me 'it makes sense for people to be gay or bi- but not just straight, because, well I don't think heterosexual relationships are good for anyone and it does not feel 'natural' to be in a monogamous sexual relationship that carries the perpetual risk of pregnancy OR requires invasive contraception, and is built on gender roles where one partner has to be active, and the other passive.   But this is how people are and this is my prejudice.   I am also partially prejudiced against bisexuality- because evidently being with a same sex person is different to being with an opposite sex person and yet bisexual people seem to be blind to it- gay relationships are more equal- and in straight relationships one partner is permanently under the threat of the other making them pregnant and forever changing the course of their life.   So I find it difficult to understand how people can not see the difference and claim 'love is love= its all the same'!   Similarly to me,  you sound prejudiced against monosexuality.  I don't 'understand' heterosexuality or even bisexuality (even though I am somewhere on the spectrum) that well but I don't need to- I just accept that they have the right to exist, and I think so should you with regards of your lack of understanding  of  monosexuality."
bisexual,3cxdf4,nagCopaleen,3,Sat Jul 11 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"I know I'm prejudiced against monosexuality, which is partially why I'm asking this question.    It's not as much that love is love and it's all the same for me as that different genders have very different types of attraction to me.  I'm attracted to a guy in a very different way from a girl as a very different way from a trans man or trans woman or any other gender expression.  Part of the reason I don't identify as pansexual is that the different gender expressions I see are distinct to me.  (This is getting off topic, but I'd almost prefer to identify as tri-sexual or n-sexual to capture that)."

bisexual,3cz4no,duotastic,8,Sun Jul 12 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"Adding onto that, if we're going to be literal with prefixes, ""hetero"" means different and ""homo"" means same.

Is he bi too? If not, what makes him such an expert? You are the one who defines your identity. Maybe link to some bi orgs that use that definition? Bisexual Resource Center and Bisexual.org are two examples."
bisexual,3cz4no,xotacoxo,3,Sun Jul 12 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"No he is straight. Basically what I told him was that words change, and vast numbers of bi people are using the ""same gender and different genders"" definition, so the word has now changed to mean that.  Where it really got rocky was when I tried to explain how he, a straight person, is privileged and is a member of a group that has been defining LGBT people for centuries, so now that the word is changing, him defining it is not valid.  That really got bad because he thought that I was saying because he is straight his view doesn't matter, where I was really trying to get him to engage with the fact that him telling me ""admit you could be wrong"" about my own identity has an implicit power differential there that isn't ok."
bisexual,3cz4no,ChollaIsNotDildo,3,Sun Jul 12 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Your friend's fixation with one interpretation of the prefix ""bi-"" doesn't really matter. English isn't rational, and your friend's ignorant attempt to force it to be, according to his narrow definition, won't make it be.  But it's also true that nobody owns the ""right"" to define a word. It's defined by its common usage. That might change over time but we bisexuals don't own it."
bisexual,3cz4no,LauraKy,2,Sun Jul 12 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"I agree.  And while it's true that we don't own the word, I think some people (especially straight people) get ruffled when I try to explain why their view on it doesn't affect how actual bi people will use the word, and therefore the eventual meaning of it in the community."
bisexual,3cz4no,LauraKy,3,Sun Jul 12 17:17:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, there is no bisexual organization that uses a binary definition of bisexuality. Most use something like 'sexual and/or romantic attraction to more than one gender'. Maybe he only follows tumblr where the young people wage wars because bi=2 and pan means everything and is so much better. We oldies know better. Secondly, prefixes are not always what they say they are. Eggplants do not grow real eggs do they? Yes, they may LOOK like eggs, but then it should have been called lookslikeeggplant or something like that. You can't always go by the prefix to determine the meaning of the whole word. Thirdly, how dare he tell you how to use your own word for your orientation. Who knows more about that, you or him?"
bisexual,3cz4no,Ottergeek,2,Sun Jul 12 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"I think he was saying something like ""It would be more accurate for you to say pansexual"" but what it really is is that he doesn't understand what I'm saying about the bi definition, and so wanted me to admit that I ""could be incorrect"" about my own sexuality.  He pressed me to admit that I COULD be wrong, but it isn't about right or wrong. It's about how you identify."

You were actually making a similar statement as him though, and overall all I was trying to say is that if a bi person view the definition as something, it is their choice to label themselves as such, and not a non-bi person's job (like my friend from the original post) to tell them they're not right about it.  Especially since the same/different definition is so prevalent.  The reason I don't say pan is because I'm not attracted to people regardless of gender, theres just more than one that I know of that I like.  So I say the same, and different, and bi."
bisexual,3cz4no,youre_a_poozer,2,Sun Jul 12 17:05:46 2015 UTC,"I hope you can see that my statement comes from a place of never having heard of this definition before and I'd suspect he hadn't either.

Queer, pan, poly, whatever you think is your own special label is, you are still represented by this subreddit.  You are the member that makes everyone else like you fit in here as well.  If you like penis and vagina, you fit the bisexual label and forum.  Welcome."
bisexual,3cz2cd,kill-if-you-will,2,Sun Jul 12 17:55:34 2015 UTC,That makes two of us.  I'm still confused and not very comfortable with my bi self and I don't feel like I can express my doubts and insecurities without coming off as wrong or insulting.

bisexual,3cyx67,Anniejo9,7,Sun Jul 12 01:18:19 2015 UTC,"First, don't feel bad that you've waited this long. Ellen Degeneres was in her 40's when she came out as gay, and Chaz Bono was also in his 40's when he came out as trans... Shit, Caitlyn Jenner is 65! you're over a decade ahead of some of the most influential LGBT people of our time.   As far as acting on your bisexuality goes, I would suggest seeking women outside of the bisexual spectrum if you haven't already. Depending on where you live, a person can be far more likely to either identify as a lesbian.   Don't give up with OkCupid either! There are tons of dating websites out there. I would recommend you stay away from sites like Tinder and seek lesbian/bi specific dating apps, such as HER or SCISSR, though you'll find that most websites you go on are much more focused lesbians than bi/pan/poly/etc. women, unfortunately. Still, though, they're women.  Your husband sounds very sweet and supportive of what you're feeling and I hope you find what you're looking for. :)"

bisexual,3cyebi,thetrexx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly with internet dating no matter what you use there WILL be some weeding out to be done but that is just like dating irl anyways, it just comes and goes quicker when you are doing it online. For me though Adam4Adam has been useful as well as Craigslist and Fetlife, with CL though you do encounter more dudes who are just looking for a quick hook up or that need to be weeded out to find the good ones.  Anyways yeah just be patient and you will find who you are looking for, trust me if you are a genuine nice guy you are bound to find one looking for the same. There are not as many as I/we would like out there so when one meets you just be cool and they will jump at the chance to meet you."

bisexual,3cyebi,Doctor_Crumb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"Grindr people seem really superficial and I don't want my first time to be with someone on Grindr. Is there a better app? Plus the folks I have seen on Grindr seem really dirty like they don't exfoliate. The problem with online dating is that people have an inflated sense of self-worth. This is a huge turn off. In Europe (especially Continental EU) and most of the world, online dating is very limited and is rarely used by people. People know where they are on the attractiveness scale and act accordingly depending on the situation. Also, back home it is easier to talk and reach a comfort level. It is really hard meeting people and making friends in the States unless you are in NY, Miami or someplace like that."
bisexual,3cyebi,Doctor_Crumb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"I can only speak from experience. I was in your position last year. Curious (to say the least) and finally giving in to a repressed ""craving"". I started out with a random grindr hookup. It was a spur of the moment thing and I was about as scared as you can get.   First time was not the revelation I expected. It felt more like a slight relief. As in ""why the fuck did I wait 2 decades to try this side of our sexual buffet?""It did however help tear down the walls of shame I spent 24 years erecting.   My tip: choose your own method/partner and dont deny  yourself based on fear.  Edit: if this made no sense or if you want to speak to someone who used to be in your positron PM me  Good luck"

You can ask me more questions if you feel I haven't given enough information yet.    I think you sound bicurious at the very least. You find the male form arousing. The idea of being anally penetrated by a male is arousing to you. It sounds like there is an interest?  I mean, in the end only you are going to be able to define yourself, how much of this is strictly fantasy, what you would like to experience in real life, etc.  But put a strike under ""bicurious/possibly bisexual"" from me."

I'm glad that you finally figured out this aspect of your personality, and that you can now continuing growing as a person (and as an adult).  I recently learned of the term ""demisexual"" and feel like its the best adjective to describe my sexuality.  I never heard of it before last week (32M, here) and its nice to realize that other people feel the same (or similarly) about sex as I do.  It helps to feel a little less alone. :)"

When I read comments like, ""Oh, I just met this guy on Grindr and I'm going over to his house so he can suck my dick"" or ""Our first date went really well; we ended up back at her place where we had tons of sex"" and I think: WHY?  They don't even know the person.  It seems disingenuous at best and extremely uncomfortable at worst.  But, I try not to judge.  We all have to live our lives the way we see fit.  Truth be told, I'm a little jealous.  There are times when the thought of a one night stand to release some sexual frustration is very appealing, but I know that when it comes down to it, I wouldn't be able to actually do it.  Anyway, thanks for listening to me rant.  :)  (Its a little payback for your wall of text above. ;) )"

""Tony"" looks like a woman with pasted on beard fuzzies and makeup. I was extremely uncomfortable with the entire portrayal, especially because the actress tried to act like the most butch lesbian she could portraying him, and it was just...blech. If you know any actual trans guys, you'll see the difference. One of the first things we lose is that 'feminine' look to our faces, we end up looking like teenage boys for the first couple months of our transition. :P"

I'm all about supporting real trans people who don't look their gender yet, but people acting in trans roles who don't look like a real trans person? Hm. :/   Oh I agree completely. The issue here with this is that she seemed to be trying to portray a trans man that is post-HRT and top-surgery. When you still look like a lady playing dress-up with a fake beard, it sends a message. She found the limit of her admittedly impressive range with ""Tony the trans guy"" I'm afraid."

Delphine in her coming out speech (of sorts) says that sexuality is a spectrum, and though she's never considered bisexuality for herself, she can't deny the attraction. Cosima, on the other hand, is all but confirmed to be a lesbian at this point.

bisexual,3cv5e6,hellohellomyfriends,4,Sat Jul 11 21:33:55 2015 UTC,I'm pretty confident in labeling Illana as bi. Her bisexuality has been there since the show was just a webshow. She's always wanted to fuck Abby and in the Broad City show it's explicit.

bisexual,3cv5e6,zay1414,4,Sat Jul 11 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"It's by no means perfect but ""lost girl"" has a bisexual/ pansexual lead character (not sure if they ever define her sexuality) who has ongoing meaningful romantic relationships with both male and female characters. She does fall into the  ""promiscuous"" category, but she is a succubus ..... So really that's a result of her magical powers/ being a sex vampire not her orientation. It's not perfect by any means but it's fun ( just avoid episode 1 of season 3 it's a smelly pile of transphobic garbage)."
bisexual,3cv5e6,zay1414,2,Sat Jul 11 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I've heard that Lost Girl is a good shitty show to watch from a couple people lol. The fact that you used the term ""sex vampire"" has me hooked already, minus the transphobia of course. I'll definitely check it out, thanks!"
bisexual,3cv5e6,sydsaysnothing,5,Sat Jul 11 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"I will forever love Bob Belcher's cannon Bi-ness FOREVER - I'm not even a dude but I appreciate it when I see bi men in hetero-marriages where he's also ok with his attraction to dudes and it isn't played like a joke.  Skyfall is interesting because James Bond even admits ""It wouldn't be his first time"" - since he's a spy by trade it could mean he was fine with doing a 'honeypot' mission. Seducing someone to get information/a lead ect or that he did experiment as a lot of men do. This I think also has a lot to do with Daniel Craig (who I think ID's as hetero) being all 'This role could be queer just as easily as this role could he hetero' because he knows that even if he isn't that doesn't mean that the characters he plays would by default be.  One of my favorite films at the moment is Appropriate Behavior - the main is openly bi and working through her previous rocky relationship with a woman. I also love this because she is a Persian urbanite and as a 'woman of colour' (goddamn do i hate that phrase but it works here) city dweller I see a lot of my own life through it than say if this were set in a farm or a rural setting."
bisexual,3cv5e6,QotNuite,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, even though Bob isn't openly bisexual or anything I just love how genuine his sexual ambiguity is compared to other comedies that use it only as a running joke. (Family Guy, Always Sunny, etc.)  I don't mind it that much when characters use their sexuality in a strategic way, it's just the stereotype of ""sexy manipulation"" that comes with bi-ness in particular. I do like that Daniel Craig has that attitude towards the subject though, props to him for being comfortable enough to deviate away from his own orientation.   And thank you for your wonderful suggestion, Appropriate Behavior looks great! Brownie points for the WOC too. Surprised I've never heard of it before."

I notice every month when I'm ovulating that im more horny for both genders and then a week or two later not so much. That could be a factor in your fluctuating sex drive. Also, it sounds like you're Bi, but there's no rush when it comes to putting a label on it. Take your time and see what you're comfortable with. Also, if the sex drive is an issue you may want to see a dr."
bisexual,3cvhmb,youre_a_poozer,2,Sun Jul 12 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"You sound like you're bisexual since you say you find both sexes attractive. I identify I bisexual and heteroromantic because I am sexually attracted to both genders, but only want a relationship and am romantically attracted to men, which is what you sound like. Sexuality is fluid, I wouldn't worry about rushing to put a label on your sexuality. As for being asexual, I don't have experience in that, but maybe you just have a lower sex drive and there's nothing wrong with that. Maybe your sex drive will go up and you won't identify as asexual and maybe you will, but I would wait a few months or so and see what you feel like before labeling it. That's what I did when I was confused!"

I find that my attractions fluctuate daily too and it seems to me to be a normal aspect of bisexuality. Or any sexuality, really. Crushes/attractions of any kind are never permanent. These changing attractions don't necessarily mean you are one thing or the other. As other have said, sexuality is fluid and your preferences may change over time. That's okay :)!  Most of the straight women/girls I know don't exactly like the look of penises or aren't particularly... enamoured with them, yet they are still sexually attracted to their boyfriends.  I can't tell you whether you are asexual or not. I might hazard a guess that perhaps you have little experience (?) and your home environment might have made you apprehensive of sex, but perhaps I am just using my own life to describe yours. All I can say is that you're not alone in your experiences and feelings.  I'm sorry if that wasn't very helpful but I hope you figure things out."
bisexual,3cvhmb,knlight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:22:05 2015 UTC,"Separate your problems.    Are you still into your boyfriend, regardless of anyone else? If yes, OK. If no, OK. But your chosen orientation label doesn't determine whether you like him, it just describes what kinds of people you like. So you don't have to worry about leaving him just because you like lady butts.  Do you like men? Women? Both? Neither? Just look at who you've been attracted to in your lifetime. If both, congrats, you're bi! No need to have sex just to figure it out. Maybe someday you can get with women, but enjoy the relationship you have.  Do you like the same kinds of people all the time, or change periodically? You might be sexually fluid. It happens and it doesn't have to break you up from your boyfriend."

I like them both in different ways. I feel differently about both, its definitely sexual for both. Often I think what really turns me on is imagning Im a guy being turned on by a woman. What does that mean? I change periodically. I often change tastes. I have changed fashion tastes, food, tastes, alcohol tastes, etc. Im constantly changing, which worries me. How can I remain happy in a monogomous relationship (which I very much want) when one year I like exclusively white blonde guys, then the next year Im into black guys wtih nice butts and women?"
bisexual,3cvhmb,blul,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:25:34 2015 UTC,I just posted about my own story realising that I was bi. I had a panic attack just like you when my feelings became way too strong for me to handle. What I suggest you is to take time for yourself. Find the time to really understand what you are feeling. It took me 7 months to figure mine out. I hope this helps! :)
bisexual,3cvhmb,blul,2,Sat Jul 11 10:11:06 2015 UTC,It does help! Im just happy to know Im not the only one who had an attack. Did the overwhelming feeling of attraction towards women and the panic involved in it eventually subside?
bisexual,3cvhmb,blul,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"(I'm a guy by the way... haha) I had the attack because whether I like it or not I can get really anxious. That day, I was so confused about my attractions + everything else in my life that I suffocated. The overwhelming feeling of attraction towards men did not subside, but it became less of a threat. I was scared of being gay (I had no idea what ""bi"" was back then) but when I accepted that I do have an attraction towards men it started to not bother me as much. I have never had a panic attack since as well, whenever I feel overwhelmed by anything I grab my running shoes and go for a run. My best advice is to accept it, take some time for your self. I don't recommend breaking up with your boyfriend (I broke up with my girlfriend to figure myself out) but you should definitely tell him that you're going through some tough stuff."

bisexual,3cvhmb,jupiter78,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:11:10 2015 UTC,"Haha! This is going to be an extremely long answer. In an extremely condensed version of my 7 months of accepting myself the process was pointing out the facts. I told myself that I liked girls, and also liked guys. I finally did not deny that attraction towards men and began to ease myself into it. I knew I couldn't be straight because I've developed feelings for a guy once, and I knew I couldn't be gay because I liked (even loved) my past girlfriends. Hence, from finally being happy with who I am, that I am able to love both genders, and if that makes me bi? So be it :) It's going to take time but it's not the most important thing in the world to label yourself. PM me if you have any more questions, I'd love to help :)"

I think he attractive overall, but little things have startde to bother me. Mostly that all of his clothing is stained and while he showers his toenails are gross with dirt under them. It bothers me because I always try to take care of things like that to look good. Its genuinly starting to affect m y attraction to him. He has also lost wieght becuase he lost his job and couldn't afford to go to the gym, however I definitely do not fault him for that and he just got a new job and started working out again so its only a matter of time.

bisexual,3ct376,umacilar,16,Fri Jul 10 19:47:08 2015 UTC,"What I understood from Shane's video, was that their relationship was already strained due to Shane being stressed out and depressed from all the emotional stuff he was going through, and he just needed a break. Sometimes there are just too many confusing emotions, and even when the SO is supportive, some people just need to be single for a while until they can process all their feelings and figure out what they want in life, especially when they've gone through something that can basically amount to an identity crisis which could call into question every step they took in life beforehand. Sometimes it's because they love the person so much, that they decide they need to take a step back to figure themselves out. If the personal issues aren't dealt with in an emotionally healthy way, then a person could end up not just harming themselves, but also harming their SO (e.g. unresolved issues causing someone to lash out at the wrong people because they haven't worked through it and developed better coping skills yet). Sometimes it's better to just step back and fix oneself first, instead of continuing a relationship with personal issues that you know will just cause undeserved stress to your partner."

It's entirely possible that you fall pretty close to ""straight"" on the Kinsey scale, but with some weak feelings of attraction toward the same sex. It happens. I'm about 25% attracted to the same sex and 75% attracted to the opposite. It doesn't have to be 50/50.  Second: even if you're bi 90/10 in favor of women, that doesn't have to be earth-shattering. I'm married to someone of the opposite sex even though I'm bi, and have very little interest in experimenting or doing anything with the same sex.  Since you seem to have had very good sexy times with women, I highly doubt you're gay. Bi, maybe, but it certainly sounds like you favor women.  It's also possible you're straight and just a bit paranoid.  Bottom line: relax. You're fine. You like women. You might kinda sorta like some guys. Cool. No problem."

When I relax and look at it with a rational mind, I don't notice any strong attraction.   What I am thinking about is that there is like a 1% of attraction to that, even though I have normally been completely straight my whole life. Up until 19 years old, being gay, or bi never even crossed my mind, even as a joke. This leads me to believe that my problem is simply normal thoughts anyone has in which sometimes unusual thoughts are mixed in with, along with a case of OCD.

There's a possibility that you might be bisexual, but since you say you're not attracted to guys, that's probably not the case either.  It's possible to be straight and still consider someone of the same sex to be attractive without being attracted to them, if that makes any sense.  Most straight people are not 100% straight, but more like 98 or 99%, meaning that there could be a few exceptions, maybe a few guys you think are hot, but if you're not interested in being with a guy it doesn't really matter that much.  Mostly, just calm down.  Even if you are bi, that's not a bad thing.  Take your time figuring things out, and don't overthink everything.  The worst that can happen is you have a larger pool of attractive people to choose from when it comes to dating, and that's actually a pretty good thing."

If she knew you were bi she probably wouldn't be surprised you like different kinds of bodies.   Why are you bringing up cheating though? There wasn't anybody else right?
bisexual,3cuynb,Jeredward,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not out to anyone and I have seen no reason to tell my sexuality.  I want her as my life partner.  I bring up cheating because a lot of posts here seem to talk about it pulling someone out of a relationship, but that is not the case for me.  Have not ever cheated, nor will I."
bisexual,3cuynb,EVILGR33NRNGR,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"My only criticism is that, while you may not consider porn as ""cheating"", some people do.

bisexual,3csas9,stupidselfishthrow,21,Fri Jul 10 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"Being transgender is a thing.  I found myself, truly found myself the first time I had sex as a man with another man after I had been on hormone therapy. When I realized he looked into my eyes and saw a man there, not a woman playing dress up.  It's worth it to transition if it is something you want. It's so, so worth it."

bisexual,3csas9,schrodingerorgsm,2,Fri Jul 10 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"I...really want to question you about this. And apologies if this seems probing. To be honest, I'm still trying to understand some facets of what it means to be trans, even though it's not something that affects me personally. I see a lot of discrimination towards them, and also am coming to realize some of my own views are not so great either. I'm sure you can dig through my comment history discussions to see how I'm learning a lot of stuff I'm wrong about.  ANYWAYS, I'm here to learn my errors, SO. Uhm, I have to ask. The common perception of being trans is that it's a factor of sexual dysphoria. Is there a large number of transgender people who don't get the anxiety from their natural body, but still feel more ""alive"" I guess when they go on HRT and the like?  It's something I want to understand, as I found out someone I used to be close to is trans now, but she never expressed any interest in it while we were dating. This made me realize my understanding was flawed. Anyways, we had a falling out years before this happened, so I can't exactly ask her(Him now I guess? Sorry how do you address pronouns when speaking in past tense...?). I would really like to understand this, because it's something my experience is limited in.  And I'm asking this in a purely non-hostile way, so sorry if I sound offensive or skeptical or anything, I just always try to understand everything on every level, which comes across as skeptical even if I'm not judging or have any problems with it."
bisexual,3csas9,aoeui-dhtns,5,Sat Jul 11 00:09:06 2015 UTC,"To be trans, you don't have to be dysphoric and you don't have to transition and you don't have to want to transition. There are plenty of us of all varieties. For instance, I'm nonbinary and I don't want to transition. I see my body and my gender as separate things. Others in my place would want to transition to a more androgynous form. We are all trans though.   I hear /r/asktransgender is helpful."
bisexual,3csas9,schrodingerorgsm,2,Sat Jul 11 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"May look into that. TBH I learn better by just lurking on subreddits like this and LGBT. Cause I'll never think to ask things like this until I see them come up in conversation. Still, thanks for the swift answer. ;)"
bisexual,3csas9,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"ANYWAYS, I'm here to learn my errors, SO. Uhm, I have to ask. The common perception of being trans is that it's a factor of sexual dysphoria.   Hmnn, okay so are what you trying to say is kind of like ""is it a fetish""? Is that what you mean by sexual dysphoria?  If so, it's ""yes and no"" type thing. I'm a trans guy. I don't personally have much dysphoria about my genitals. I'm cool with being a ""cuntboy"" or whatever the equivalent to ""chick with a dick"" is. My biggest issues were social and body dysphoria. Sometimes hearing myself talk was enough to set me off. I never had a very feminine voice, but hearing myself laugh and hearing a husky but very female voice? I hated it. I hated that people would ""m'am"" me over the phone or in public. I hated knowing people saw a woman and not a man. Part of that was dating and sex. Dating as a woman always felt wrong. When I was a teen, I had this weird obsession/jealousy going on with gay and bisexual guys. (Apparently it's pretty common for gay/bi FtM guys to feel this way, as I've talked with other guys on Reddit who feel this way too.) I always felt like I should have been born a guy. I wanted to be regarded as a man, dating another man. My actual role hasn't changed in the bedroom. I'm very much happy as a ""double bottom"" as I tell people I date. It wasn't about becoming the stereotypically masculine ""penetrator"", it was about becoming a guy. So it really was about how others saw me, and how I saw myself.  But to answer your question: Essentially, no. Even if someone told me that me being trans would render me incapable of dating anyone, I would have still done it. I needed society to acknowledge the person I really am.   Is there a large number of transgender people who don't get the anxiety from their natural body, but still feel more ""alive"" I guess when they go on HRT and the like?   Ehhhh...no? I mean, it depends on what you mean by ""anxiety. Dysphoria is a sometimes insidious beast. I never hated my body, but I never loved it or felt connected to it either. I always felt pressured to be ""feminine"" in a purely female way that didn't sit well with me. One of the first things I did was grow out my armpit hair. It sounds silly, but that was so freeing! Cutting my hair short, letting my armpit hair grow, not worrying about my hairy arms (Italian, I was destined to be a hairy guy, I was a hairy girl)...all of it felt like a revelation to me. But I've never met a trans person who could say with certainty that they loved their body beforehand.  Does this help at all? I'm afraid I'm not 100% positive of what you mean by your questions. As for you being hostile/offensive/skeptical, nah, don't worry about it. I'm always happy to answer questions, even the hard ones, the NSFW ones, the ""not politically correct"" ones, as long as the person asking is truly willing to learn from the experience. So, any questions you have, feel free to ask here or PM me."
bisexual,3csas9,schrodingerorgsm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not even sure what I was asking. I just wanted a perspective, you know? And you answered that request marvelously. Its hard to know these things without talking to someone who has intimate knowledge of what it really means. Christ, some of that shit I can actually relate to...Ive always had some jealousy as a man of the fact that women have SO many more options in clothing and style. They can present in more ways. But I'm not saying I'm trans, just that I can relate. I'm pretty comfortable being a dude, but I can understand some aspects of that. Then again, when I came out as bi to my good friends, one of them said ""well to be honest that's not very surprising. You're pretty dainty"". Lol...  Meh. Back on point, I don't think I can really ever understand what it means to be trans, but having gained these perspectives in a way I can sort of relate to? That helps. A lot. It also means I can defend trans people to my Christian friends a lot easier. Haha. Anyways, thanks for taking the time to explain all of this. I might take you up on your offer for questions, but in truth you answered so well I can't think of any."

bisexual,3ct7jv,throwaway-070,3,Fri Jul 10 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"You do not sound even SLIGHTLY pathetic! You sound like you're going through what a LOT of us deal with when we come out--first to ourselves, and then to others, if and when we feel comfortable and safe doing so. I will say that it's pretty darn hard to date people of the same gender without coming out. You may be able to find safe spaces where you live to meet/date/hook up with other guys who don't want to be out publicly, or you may run into another guy who is willing to date you more quietly. No matter what, just make sure to be honest with yourself and your partners (and always practice safer sex!!!)     Let me address coming out first. YOU are the only one who gets to decide how, when, where, and why you come out. If you don't feel comfortable, safe, and confident doing so, there's nothing wrong with keeping your sexuality to yourself. There are a lot of benefits to coming out--more visibility for the queer community, a personal feeling of accomplishment and peace, feeling free from hiding who you are--but you get to make that choice. I was pressured into coming out to my parents before I was ready by my girlfriend at the time, and it was a bad move all around. I hope you can find even more supportive and trusting people to help you come out in the way that works best for you!     As far as religion is concerned, you'd be amazed at how many people are queer and also devoted Christians. Check out /r/openchristian here on Reddit! There are hundreds of thousands of us, so you are definitely not alone in trying to reconcile your faith and sexuality. Heck, check out any Pride parade in a major city, and you'll see DOZENS of religious organizations coming out to support us!"
bisexual,3ct7jv,rab0t,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words. And haha yeah, my first thought was 'oh, I can just meet someone at a club' but I tend to go out with the same people, and they would definitely notice if I went anywhere with a guy...  Yeah... in retrospect I totally regret telling them. Although if ever I have a steady boyfriend, I guess it saves that shock factor haha.  And wow, there really is a subreddit for everything <3 thank you so much for the link, I will explore it further."

My 'rents and I still fight and they still don't ""get"" my sexuality, but we've made MASSIVE strides since I came out. Our relationship is pretty healthy now, and we will never stop loving each other, which is the main thing. I hope you and your folks can reach a similar (or even better!) place."
bisexual,3ct7jv,Jeredward,2,Fri Jul 10 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"Hi.  I don't have any answers because I'm kind of in the same place you are.  (Although, I'm agnostic, so I don't have to reconcile any religious teachings.)  If its wrong to not be confident in coming out, then I'm wrong, too.  But, I don't feel like I want to do it right now, and I'm okay with that.  I wish I knew how to find guys without being ""out"", so I could finally move out of the ""bi-curious"" area and into either the ""straight"" or ""bisexual"" area.    Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone, and you have people (e.g. me) you can talk to about it (even if I have no answers, I can listen and nod sympathetically)."
bisexual,3ct7jv,therealtwocones,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in a similar situation! (Bi female) I'm out to my friends and my sister who I'm very close to. I've told a few of my open-minded and liberal cousins who I've sworn to secrecy. But the rest of my family doesn't know, especially my parents. Unfortunately I can pretty much guarantee that telling them I'm anything but a full-on straight would drive a HUGE wedge in our relationship. (Sidenote: When my sister came out to them many years ago, they disowned her for about 10 years...)  So no, it's TOTALLY normal to not be comfortable outing yourself to everyone! If you can't count on people to be supportive, then you don't need to inflict stress and suffering on yourself. I feel like there's a real push lately by the LGBT+ community for everyone to be ALL OUT ALL THE TIME which works for some, but not for everyone! You don't owe it to anyone to out yourself all the way if that's not what's best for YOU.  As for trying to find guys, I would suggest OKCupid because it's a good intermediary between showing up at a gay bar/club and thus openly outing yourself and just sort of waiting around to meet a rando gay guy that you're into in your regular life routine. That has worked pretty well for me as a woman, anyway. Hope this helps at all!"

bisexual,3cr405,alwaysanonymous,4,Fri Jul 10 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"Can confirm as a bi guy that these sorts of things come up.  Easiest example is how in the ""gay culture"" (quotation marks because it's not exactly an accurate term) there'll be a question of who's the ""top"" or the ""bottom"".  That doesn't happen in the ""straight culture"" - instead you get archtypes of either the guy being more dominant ""as he should be"", or him being more passive and ""hen-pecked"". Or people feel like they fall into a guy-dominant gendered relationship naturally just cause that's how popular media portrays it."
bisexual,3cr405,ToanDaxland,6,Fri Jul 10 13:08:30 2015 UTC,"I've had both experiences. In my first serious gay relationship, she was very much the 'dominant' role. She was a fair bit older than me, and had the money really, so it was almost natural for our dynamic to fall that way. She courted me, dined and wined, etc etc.  On the other end of the scale, I dated someone for a year who was the same age as me, into the same things, and pretty much as mellow as I am. We never really had a power dynamic at all, that I could tell... we were just comfortable. Both happy initiating activities, initiating sex, making general decisions..."
bisexual,3cr405,BrokenDesires,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yup! Pretty much everything /user/ToanDaxland and /user/BrokenDesires mentioned.  My boyfriends have all been older than me. Most with jobs. Subconsciously I felt... well, like I was being the ""woman."" Younger and jobless (I'm searching!)  This girl I'm currently dating has job, car, and is 4 years younger than me... she told me she likes being treated like ""a girl"" and that was a ""gender-shock"" for me. I'm not sure how to make girls feel like girls (because I don't like being treated femininely, so I dunno :s) but I've been trying!  Buuuut she also told me she didn't feel any gender role pressure or anything, so I guess everything is alright in the end."
bisexual,3cr405,rab0t,7,Sat Jul 11 06:24:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't found most women I've been with to give a toss about gender roles--mostly that's come up with guys. I think it depends on your area, the queer (and straight) culture that surrounds you, and the person in question. Don't think of that attitude as a fixed thing, because it's definitely not! It varies from person to person and place to place.   Congrats on your date! It sounds like you're on the path to a lot of learning and, hopefully, a lot of fun. :) Piece of advice though: don't let anybody pressure you into coming out, not even this girl you like. You may also want to be a little wary of her BFF--if she's ""best friends"" with someone who's ""really homophobic,"" she might be dealing with some internalized homophobia herself. Not saying you should back out because of it, but it's something to be aware of.  Happy dating! :D"

I dunno, they've been best friends for years and she said she is worried how more serious he is going to get about his religion, that they might not be friends anymore.   From what she's told me, she is pretty comfortable being out as lesbian, but that'd still be a good topic to carefully bring up."

bisexual,3ctcw9,madi_28z,3,Fri Jul 10 16:47:23 2015 UTC,"As a bisexual woman in her 20s from California, there are a few things I feel should be mentioned here, for the sake of your experience and your well-being.  The only experiences that would be fair barometers of your sexuality would be those in which you are potentially attracted to the other person, whether that be physically, emotionally, whatever. If you had put up this post looking for a guy, any guy, to test whether you like guys, what happens if you have absolutely ZERO connection with him whatsoever? Does that mean you don't like guys? No, it means you don't like THAT guy. Point is, the only thing this will test is whether you like going out on a date with the specific person who turns up. You'd be much better off joining a meetup group of people your age in San Fran and finding someone who you think is cute/kind/whatever. Or, if you are going to college, participating in some LGBT activities and just meeting people in that kind of an environment.   Now for the less interesting, but arguably more important insight: The age of consent in California is 18. Someone who is overage can still go to jail for molesting a child, which, depending on the circumstance and type of kiss, can include kissing. I'm not saying that to baby you or suggest you'd end up in bed with this person, but to point out that the TYPE OF PERSON who is overage who would agree to an arrangement like this is NOT someone who you would want to be meeting. There is just no reason someone who is 21 should be actively seeking out a date/makeout sesh with a 17 year old over the internet, period.  If you are looking to do something like this in San Francisco, my advice would be to track down some LGBT youth resources. It's summer, so there are probably different activities where you could meet some age-appropriate folks.  Just remember that there is no rush to figure out your sexuality. It is something that unfolds with time, as you have more experiences. It's great that you are interested in exploring these things-just make sure you are giving yourself a fair and safe chance to do so. Good luck! :)"
bisexual,3crb37,mightythor84,12,Fri Jul 10 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"Well I was always asked this same thing when I was in a long-term committed relationship but ""claimed to be bi"". I always explained that a persons sexuality is not who they chose to be with, but rather it's apart of who they are.  Plus I was fed up with people trash talking bisexuality. Claiming it was made up or just a phase. I wanted the people around me to understand that we are real, we exist."
bisexual,3crb37,jchaosrs,7,Fri Jul 10 05:49:27 2015 UTC,"You don't have to identify or be out if you don't want to.

I just wasn't really aware of the existence of bisexuality as a real possibility. Then I was talking to a friend, a married woman, and she casually mentioned her bisexuality and it blew my mind. I thought bisexuality was just something rock stars made up, I never thought someone as boring as me could be bisexual. A few weeks later I finally figured it all out and my whole world changed.   Everybody who is visible makes a tiny bit of difference, whether you ever find out or not. I never told this woman what effect it had on me. It's also about being true to yourself and not keeping secrets. To just ignore part of yourself is never a good idea."

Whether that's getting the bisexual pride flag painted across your house or never telling anybody else ever, it's all up to you, and it is ALL valid.  Many find that coming out as bi and claiming their identity, even if they're in a relationship that seems ""straight"" by the standards of others, can help with feelings of frustration, loneliness, and cognitive dissonance (keeping one set of facts/truths inside your head, and knowing everybody else is unaware of them). It may help you feel more free, more true to yourself, and more honest to start exploring your identity. You might find yourself enjoying your queerness instead of carrying like burden or something you're ""doing wrong."" Alternatively, you may find that it isn't worth it to you to come out more publicly, seek out support groups for bi people, etc. I want to stress that it's totally okay to have that response. I totally understand feeling like you're not a ""real bisexual"" because of your current relationship (see my last post, yo), but YOU are the only person who gets to make that judgement.

Not that they had guessed wrong or thought you looked older, just that someone somewhere misread your birthday and it stuck, and now everyone calls you 35.  It's no big deal and it doesn't actually affect anything, but it would feel weird, right?  When your next birthday roles around and someone says, ""Happy 36th!"", would you cringe awkwardly and say nothing, or would you laugh and say, ""31st!"""

While coming out is great for visibility and the community at large, the final decision-making factor (for me at least) was my own personal comfort. I found that it added substantial quality to my life to be 'out', and I didn't feel like I was hiding any part of myself from the people in my life. I never had any big 'coming out' moment, I just stopped censoring my inner dialogue about my attractions to the same sex, and let things work themselves out from there.

bisexual,3crb37,youre_a_poozer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:41 2015 UTC,"Same exact situation here. Right down to just figuring it out a few weeks ago. I wish I had had the opportunity to try being with women before I got married but it didn't work out that way & I am completely happy & fulfilled in my marriage. I feel the same way about coming out & right now my husband is the only one who knows. I've never told anyone else that I'm attracted to women because it's none of their business & now that I identify as Bi so late in the game I don't know if there's a point in telling anyone. I know I won't tell my parents & step parents because they are religious and I don't give a shit if they know. I'm happy with my identity and I don't care what they think. I'm thinking I'll only come out to my one brother, who is also Bi, and my grandmother, who is a huge supporter of the LGBT community. Mostly because I'm happy about it and want to tell someone and I know they'll be positive, but ultimately it's no ones business besides me and my husband."
bisexual,3crb37,nashife,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:59:18 2015 UTC,"Your story is my story.  I don't have an answer, and I go back and forth all the time between wanting to be more ""out"" as bi and thinking there isn't a lot of a point to it.  On the one hand, I think it's important especially for young people to see that anyone, even your relatively vanilla-looking normal english teacher can be queer and that there's nothing wrong with it, and I'd like to do my part to make society see that we're just a normal part of society rather than a fringe or special interest group...  But on the other hand... I'm like you. In a committed opposite sex relationship with a cis straight man, and never identified with the queer community other than being an outspoken ally, like you describe yourself.    I don't really know where I'm going with this post other than to just say that you're not alone in feeling that way."

They are only romantically attracted to women but are sexually much more into men. I actually have the opposite problem you have. I'm a bi man who's homo-romantic.

I'd just start out talking to her about normal stuff like something school related. Then once you've talked you could could just say hi in passing or stop and chat for a few seconds when you see her around. Hopefully getting a feel for what she's into. If there's a movie or band she's into you could eventually casually say ""Hey I'm going to see ___this weekend. You wanna come?"" Or casually during a stop and chat ask if she wants to go get a cup of coffee or a drink depending on the time of day. I'd say just letting it come up casually is more natural and less awkward pressure on both of you than it would be if you came up out of the blue and asked if she'd like to go on a date. Good luck! Let us know how it goes."

Any time I meet new people I don't tell them, I just keep it to myself but I'm a socially awkward guy so my way of communicating is constant humor and the jokes about me sucking dick or something always go down well (going down well is one of my specialties) . every time without fail if I tell someone that doesn't know they say something like ""you don't seem bi"" or ""I never would have guessed"".

Going back to your question, I think I can somewhat relate to you. I'm not very feminine (I would say I'm a normal guy), but I used to (and still do a bit) joke about being gay and joke about acting gay. For me, I think, it was(is) a sort of defense in case I inadvertently did/said something that may have sounded gay. In that case, people would have simply thought I was joking as usual. This to the point that I think that my few friends who I told once I'm bi, probably think that my ""coming out"" was also a joke.  I don't know if I'm good at hiding it. In HS for sure not, but that was a weird environment. I also guess someone (my family?) think I'm gay since I haven't had any serious relationship with a girl."

I know that not having a relationship always casts doubt, which is something that I don't like.  As for your jokes, I know the feeling about that, as well.

So all the faking and joking is just a sign of my insecurities. I wonder if this is actually also your case. You say that a lot of things you do sound gay, but maybe it's just your impression.  I'm quite sure that some people in my family think that I'm gay and a friend recently told me (jokingly, but maybe not too much) ""I would still love you even if you're gay"". Sometimes I actually wonder if I'm actually homoromantic since, with the benefit of hindsight, my ""bromantic"" relationships were much more true than the short ones with girls.

I never told more than two colleagues about previous relationships with women, although one once mentioned the possibility of my being bisexual in passing. I guess I'm ok with it too - my boyfriend knows, my brother knows, the women I've slept with who are still my friends know, and there's only one person who I wished knew, because I was majorly crushing on her for two years and I'm still clinging onto some strand of false hope despite her being straight, but we're not close enough for me to tell her."

They eventually got over it, once they got to know him and see how happy he makes me, and he and I are now talking about marriage. He's going to pop the question soon -- I know it's coming, I just don't know when. So it did all work out.  But over the last few months, I've leaned to accept that I'm bi. My boyfriend and a few close friends are the only people who know this about me. And since he and I have a semi-open relationship (""semi"" because neither of us has ventured out and dated anyone else yet), I'm free to explore my sexuality without it hurting him. Obviously, my parents are unaware of any of this, and I don't intend on ever telling them.  Basically, I'm a bunch of things an Indian-American girl isn't supposed to be."

bisexual,3cr00i,throwaway-070,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"Came out to my family a few weeks ago. Being from a Christian upbringing, they completely freaked out. It didn't help that I phoned them rather than being face-to-face (was not at home in the foreseeable future), but yeah.  Things still aren't finished unfortunately- my father is uncomfortable around me (you can see it in everything he does), and my mother sat me down to say how she thinks I am being 'far too hasty' and that in time I will 'sort myself out'. She even said how 'in the real world' people will look down on me for not being straight, and urged me to tell noone about my sexuality. Which I mean, wasn't really the support I was looking for.  So I guess in that respect I can totally relate to you. I really hope that things sort themselves out for you- I mean, you are who you are, and they should be able to love you and respect your decisions no matter what."

bisexual,3cph34,MatticusVP,10,Thu Jul 9 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, no throwaway, if you ever read this baby, love you! I told her earlier this year. I was feeling incredibly ""unwell"" by not being honest with her about it. I had tried really hard to tell her several times but chickened out. After we got married I felt a building pressure to tell her. The arguments in my head were “what is the point, I'm committed to monogamy” vs. “she doesn’t actually know who I am deep down”.   It lead me to feel pretty unconfident and just altogether ‘wrong’. She eventually got it out of me one night, after I had spent that day warring between telling her and not. I had chickened out again and we were going to bed but she could tell how distraught I was about something and with enough gentle pressure got me to tell her.   My wording was “honey I have never told anyone this, but I have never considered myself 100% straight. I very much prefer women, but I know I’m not straight”.  Her reaction straight away was to kind of nod and get teared up and hug me. She then complained how unfair it was that society made it so hard for us to be ourselves etc. I think she was trying to find something to say at that point but I was just so relieved she didn’t run a mile. We chatted a bit about how it was for me when I was growing up etc. and I was feeling incredibly relieved and peaceful. Her reaction 2 days later was a bit more what I had been expecting. This was when she cried a little bit and asked for more detail, why had I never told her this, what did I expect her to do with this information etc. She wasn’t ‘unaccepting me’ but I think she was just trying to figure out what the hell I’d just told her and what it meant (quite rightly). We chatted about it and I spent some time apologising for the deceit. I also spent a lot of time reassuring her how much I wanted her and that I had made the choice a long time ago that she was for me. I knew that her reaction was going to come at some point and she deserved the answers. I still don’t regret telling her for a second, best thing she ever made me do lol. These days we don’t really discuss it much, the odd comment now and then but it’s pretty much just added to part of who I am."

I'm glad that you're able to show her that being bisexual doesn't mean you need to have both. (No harm to need both, but it's a stereotype I'm glad to see being phased out since it does a lot of harm to people who don't feel that way.) I've had a hard time explaining to some of the people in my life that while my capacity for attraction is bisexual, I'm pretty much 'relationshipssexual'. I don't need for anything outside of a monogamous relationship."
bisexual,3cph34,TheLonelySamurai,4,Fri Jul 10 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"I told my wife when we first started chatting. She is very accepting, although she sometimes gets a bit insecure with how quickly I am attracted to other people. I keep telling her that I can't help that I am that way, but that I am choosing to be with her. She is not very confident with how she looks (she is very fat due to wrong medicines and now she can't get rid of it anymore) and because of previous experiences. So I can understand that. All I can do is keep telling her that I am a monogamous person and that I have no need to look further because she makes me perfectly happy :)"
bisexual,3cph34,LauraKy,3,Thu Jul 9 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"I figured out I'm bi out after being married to my husband for almost a decade.  He started noticing that we play rp games differently (the kind where you can romance npcs), and that tiny nudge was the first domino, the thing that made me first start asking myself honest questions.  He was there every step of the way figuring it out over the next year, so that was great.  (Yeah, I know: rp games.  Very frivolous start.  Whatever works.)  Now he has great fun asking if I find various actresses or pictures attractive.  Anytime I start getting mad about something in a game or in the news, he pulls up a photo of a hot naked woman on his computer and waits for me to notice; it's very difficult to maintain a coherent line of thought while you're giggling/turned on.  (We're totally monogamous, though: that was a non-negotiable part of our relationship, for both of us.  I'm very happy for other couples that make that work, but he and I are just not wired for polyamory.  NOPE NOPE NOPE.)"

He was like ""that's cool"" but beyond that it doesn't really come up. I think he's the kind of person that doesn't think much about whether he's attracted to someone if it's hypothetical. So he shows a lot of interest in me, but almost none in celebrities for example. Because of that, we don't often do things like pointing out who's attractive on a show or anything."

I would leave him for a girl 2. People would find out his wife is not normal. He knew that about me from the start. My current husband is quite opposite. He loves that I am bi. Its one of the things about me he fell in love with.   My ex knew because I broke off a fling I had with a girl when I started dating him. But we never actually talked about it. If we had I would have realized much sooner that he was not ok with it and saved myself a lot of hurt over it.   My rule now is to always be up front about that.

Her and I had broken up for a short while and I made the best of it and spent some quality time with a male friend. . .a few times. Those were my first real MM activity besides dinky stuff in middle school. A little while after we got back together we were having sex and she asked a few open ended questions kinda leading me to tell her about those MM times. Aparently, she suspected I was Bi and knew that if I did do anything she knew who it would be with so none of it was a surprise. She wasn't mad since we were broken up at the time. I was glad to tell her because I had never told anyone except the guy I had been with that I was bi. She was fine with it and a few years later we had a few bi MMF threesomes. Recently, she has told me that I am free to fulfill my male on male urges as long as I keep her informed and play safe.

Just make sure that if you do include someone else, that you are not turning them (or yourself) into a kind of male-fantasy prop for your boyfriend.

I'm not really interested in men much but I have a male partner.  I'm incredibly interested in HIM, but other men not so much, just him and women really.    But missing sex with women is much less of a big deal when you aren't prohibited from it.  I haven't been with a women in awhile because I broke up with my previous partner (got sick of her jealousy and double standards of us supporting her in her other relationships and the fact that she freaked out when we began talking to another woman despite that fact that we had been through multiple discussions regarding the fact the relationship was not exclusive).  My partner and I did try to start a new relationship a few months back but she realized that her bi-curiously was less bi then she thought (she and I are still friends, she's FWBs with my male partner).  I don't know, its probably one of the reasons I'm not monogamous along with the fact I prefer to show love by sharing and I've never really understood or experienced sexual possessiveness in relationships."

I am attracted to guys about 70% of the time but mostly only in a sexual manner. The guy % tends to move up and down depending on my mood. I am also aware that I do feel I could have an emotional connection as well as physical with a guy in the right circumstance. Only been there once in my life so far but have fallen in love with women often.  The most basic test would be: 1. Do you ever find yourself attracted to women? 2. Do you ever find yourself attracted to men?  If you answer yes to both of those, you are bisexual and fall somewhere on the bisexual scale. Just my $.02.  That is how I feel about it."

There's also a difference between romantic and sexual attraction, where you may feel varying levels of attraction as well. Very few bi people are equally attracted to all genders, and most bi people go through what you're going through right now.   That doesn't necessarily mean you're bi, though. It's all about self-identification, and labels aren't for everyone (although they do help a lot of people feel like they're not broken).  As for the homophobia when you were younger, that is normal growing up in a heteronormative society. I grew up in a small town, and I was told when I was little that being gay was bad. It's even worse when you're LGBTQQIA+; a lot of us tend to overcompensate for the hatred in order to hide ourselves better. I hid my sexuality for many years, and only came out when I was leaving the town. I'm not fully out yet; it's a long process for most people. Just know that you have all the time in the world, and you have a community to support you no matter what you discover about yourself."

You could even just find one <gender> here and be <them> sexual but really only attracted to <opposite gender> here.

bisexual,3cpf74,fail_nerd,3,Thu Jul 9 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are bisexual. Bisexual means that you are sexually and/or romantically attracted to more than one gender. Bisexuality is basically a range of a number of attractions: - from being attracted to just men and women to being attracted to all the different kinds of genders; - from sexual and romantic attraction being the same to sexual and romantic attraction being completely different; - from gender expression is important for your attraction to it plays no role at all; - from it it has been this way your whole life to it changes all the time. As you see, there are many different ways to be bisexual. There are as many different ways of being bisexual as there are bisexual people, I think. Being confused is very understandable. But no need for panic :) Just take a deep breath and see this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself."
bisexual,3cpf74,LauraKy,2,Thu Jul 9 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"You could be bi or pan, but labels aren't always all they're cracked up to be. They can help if you're feeling broken or lost and confused, but you need to figure out what you like and who you are. I don't know your gender or what your experiences have been, but your therapist should definitely be someone you can talk to and at least help you feel calmer about how you're feeling. As for your parents, you haven't mentioned how accepting of LGBTQ+ people they are. You don't have to come out to them right now. Get yourself figured out first, whether you use a label or not.  No matter what happens, you will always be you, and there will always be people who will be there for you, even if it's just to listen. I don't know what your irl friend situation is like, but you're posting on a forum dedicated to a strong community that will be here for you in this questioning time. I know the folks at /r/questioning are even more eager to help, that's what they're all about. Just stay strong and don't let anyone tarnish your shine, no matter what happens."
bisexual,3cpf74,BeesorBees,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't panic.  You have your whole life to figure out how you identify.  Take your time, reflect on what you like about different kinds of people.  You don't have to call yourself anything, though you are welcome to call yourself bi or pansexual if you find that you like people of multiple genders.    As long as your therapist is even halfway decent, that would be a great person to start discussing this with.  If they give you any shit or insist that you are definitely gay or definitely straight, then respectfully tell them you are going to find a better therapist."

Remember that heterosexuals find more people attractive than just their partner. So what is it that you want? Do you want an open relationship, or a polyamorous one, or just want to have threesomes? You'll obviously need to talk with your girlfriend, but that conversation needs to be about how you'd like to redefine/expand your relationship, and not just about your bisexuality. Good luck!"
bisexual,3conv7,SquareBottle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"I think part of my stress in the situation is feeling uncertain if I really am bi if I've never put myself into that situation, and that this would change how I see myself compared to other LGBT people. I don't want to seem like some hetero poser who suddenly decided he's LGBT and now gets to speak for the community or get involved. A lot of people have known me as straight for a long time. Thanks for the support, and I'll definitely go more in depth with my girl friend about this."
bisexual,3conv7,SquareBottle,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"I don't want to seem like some hetero poser who suddenly decided he's LGBT and now gets to speak for the community or get involved.   One of the saddest things is when people treat activism like it's a clique or a hobby. The right kind of activism is the one that's about helping make positive change happen, invites everybody to be an activist, and celebrates all acts of activism in proportion to the amount of positive effect that they have. The wrong kind of activism is the kind that's about impressing people, excludes constituents and pushes away allies, and discourages helpful acts of activism by conducting witchhunts for posers.  For the record, straight people can and should get involved. They shouldn't speak over the voices of LGBTQ people when it comes to things like talking about what it's like to be LGBTQ or deciding what should or shouldn't be important to that community. But if a straight person can help by doing the right kind of activism, then great. In fact, one simple way that they can start is by not making it a point to declare their straightness. (They shouldn't lie about it either. The goal is to leave it unknown unless/until asked, and make clear that they don't see any reason to be offended if people think you're LGBTQ).  So for you, whether you decide that you are straight or bi, you should feel encouraged to be a part of the LGBTQ activism community. :)"
bisexual,3conv7,CapriciousSon,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:07 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about what people think!  I didn't really come out to myself until I had a supportive girlfriend either, and I had never considered bottoming until she gently kept suggesting it.  If you've never tried anal play, I highly recommend it! Just start very slow, and remember that if it hurts, ease off and relax...no need to shove a giant dildo in there, just a finger (nails clipped!)  And remember, you can be TOTALLY straight and still be into butt stuff.  Straight guys don't like to admit it, but it's way more common than most people think."

It can work just fine if you're genuinely happy with the person you're with. Being in a committed relationship is about deciding to stop looking because you're happy, and in my case, that just means I've decided to stay with this one person regardless of never having same-sex experience because I am in love and care more about maintaining that than about broadening my experience - there are plenty of other types of opposite sex people I haven't had experience with, either.

I've never even come close to being in a relationship with a woman, and tbh I'm sort of overwhelmed and scared when I think about the possibility.

bisexual,3cn1pu,LadyMuffington,6,Fri Jul 10 03:28:35 2015 UTC,"I think I can explain why you don't get that 'fluttery' feeling when you see a pretty woman on the street.  Because we are in a hetero normative society, you'll look at a man and a part of you just assumes he is straight, and thus he is someone you can ""allow"" yourself to check out.  Whereas you look at other women and also think they're straight and thus there is no point in you entertaining any fantasies about her, even if she is smoking hot. It's a way of saving yourself from rejection.  But if you read a few articles on 'how to hit on girls' etc you may slowly to be able to teach yourself that anyone could be gay/bi . So you find yourself looking at women in a whole different light, and if it turns out they're straight and you've hit on them, well you've just brightened their day with a massive compliment.  This happened to me and now I perv on EVERYONE. Not sure if that's a good thing but I'm enjoying it!"

I love that you said, ""queerness is really scary,"" because it TOTALLY IS, and it's nice to be reminded that it's okay to struggle through your queerness.  I hope the process of coming out (again, and again...) goes as easily for you as such things can. It can be so exhausting! I think you're the brave one for going through all that for somebody you love. :)"

bisexual,3cl49t,Unicorn_Tea_Party,7,Wed Jul 8 22:55:13 2015 UTC,Just remember that's alot for some one take in and two it may make him feel like he isn't cutting it for her any more he is most likely just using humor as a deflection from how he actually feels about this. Especially if he was put on the spot with it. I highly doubt he did it just for the sake of humor.
bisexual,3cl49t,lambda26,2,Thu Jul 9 03:47:47 2015 UTC,I so agree how about you tell him that you want to peg him first..... That assmunch grrr...but I feel for you we're here for you if you wanna talk
bisexual,3cl49t,techn0path,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:32:29 2015 UTC,"How you respond depends on how he is normally. Is he normally like this? Does he go for abrasive jokes to cope, or does he genuinely not care for you that much. Reddit can't offer advice, only theories.  I will say personally, I'm only out to close friends and nobody really gives a shit. There are jokes sometimes, yes, but we joked about each others sexuality before cause that's what ""friends"" do. Haha. Anyways, some people will be dicks, but most people will probably just be like ""huh"" and move on. Your biggest concern is, unfortunately, being fetishized as threesome material. Just be careful with that. You may be targeted by guys for that reason. That said, lots of good guys may still find your bisexuality attractive without it being a disrespectful thing.  Its really not that bad."
bisexual,3cl49t,schrodingerorgsm,44,Thu Jul 9 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"Hell, I've gotten better responses from extremely conservative religious people. Maybe it's time to dump his ass and find someone who respects you."
bisexual,3cl49t,PyroMechanical,11,Wed Jul 8 21:50:29 2015 UTC,"If they do, they'll have to prepare for all the shit he's going to talk. That tends to be common, even when the person is heterosexual, but in this case I can imagine the guy going on a tirade about how he knew they'd break up because  she wanted to get with a girl. I going to agree with the general consensus though. That guy sounds like an asshat."

bisexual,3cl49t,MatticusVP,13,Wed Jul 8 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"While I don't condone his response, he might just be insecure.  He may be thinking you like a girl and are going to brake up with Him to explore this side of yourself, and he's attempting to defuse that with bad humor.  I'm not saying this is the case, but its possible. I can't say without knowing the guy myself."
bisexual,3cl49t,bluegreenwookie,7,Thu Jul 9 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, he was insensitive. But on the other hand, he doesn't seem to think it's a big deal, like, at all. To you that might feel like he's doubting you, and sure, maybe he is, but it's obvious he considers the possibility that you are bisexual to be a perfectly benign possibility. He's not horrified, he's not disgusted, he's not shunning you. He's just being kind of a jerk. Well fine. But don't let that stop you from coming out. Some people may be jerks about it but whatever. You can take it. And there are people like us who will take you seriously. But people can't surprise you unless you give them a chance."
bisexual,3cl49t,dallasdarling,3,Thu Jul 9 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with what a few of the other posters have said and that he didn't mean to sound like a douche. Whenever I'm in a serious conversation, I tend to make lame jokes as well. He could have been nervous and trying to tell you ""It's not big deal. See? I'm making awful jokes about it!""  This is all just speculation of course and if it offends you, make sure you tell him that. Over and over again because guys are dumb and sometime people need to hit us over the head with information. :P"

I enjoy doing stuff with men, but it's fairly limited in that respect, compared to what I enjoy doing with women.

As long as you still want to be with him, im sure he was just playing around. Don't listen to reddit, everyone always wants you to dump your bf on here! Sure we can be supportive, but just cause he made a bad joke and you were sensitive doesn't mean you should dump him.  Anyway good luck! Being bi is no big deal... people are way more accepting of women being bi. Double standard i know. Sorry if it is a huge thing for you, it does get better. :)"
bisexual,3cn18q,disc-overer-Pic-c,4,Thu Jul 9 04:23:49 2015 UTC,I havent come out twice... or really once for that matter but only because I dont really think its anyone elses business. I know you probably feel embarassed but I dont think you should. Everybody does things that they think other people will dwell on forever when in actuality they dont. Just go with the flow and mind your own. There are times when I feel almost completely straight and other times when I feel closer to completely Gay. It fluctuates with me so much I just dont even bother to explain it to people haha so you're in good company. Im sure you're fine.
bisexual,3cn18q,SanDiegoans,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:34:25 2015 UTC,"Sexuality fluctuates in a lot of people. It's perfectly possible that you were completely gay at one point, but that isn't true any more. The good news is that Coming OutTM isn't a one-time thing, It's a process of telling everyone you meet in life at whatever point you feel comfortable telling them and then doing it over and over again for the next person, and the one after that. This means that people from now on can know you're bi and that your sexuality is more fluid. You can own that just as much as people own being squarely in one box and never changing."
bisexual,3cn39z,GrundleFudge,7,Thu Jul 9 04:43:15 2015 UTC,Initiative I think. You see some of us have just come out of our shells and ya we may look good but dating the same sex is new and we get flustered. Also when I first started I didn't know how to go about it. On the other hand some of us older outs are also very shy. I get so nervous I say the wrong words all the time.

It's far from uncommon and may be a lot more common than people realize. Porn is fantasy. People love to watch porn of things that they don't do (and don't even really want to try) in real life.

bisexual,3cjwu2,Hatless,2,Thu Jul 9 01:12:22 2015 UTC,"Not to sound redundant, but... And I have read the comments that say, the demographics are granulated, and that people watch gay porn and jack off/ have sex to it but are still ""straight"" (eye rolling) but you have to cut the percentage of people who have same sex attraction 1%-3% or even 10% and cut those numbers in half in order to account for the separate male and female genders. That means that .5% - 1.5% or 5% of either males or females were effective in launching same sex porn (MM and FF) to the top ten genres of porn according to popularity for each gender.    To me you can say your fantasies involve same sex contact between males (or females) and that you enjoy pornographic material of that nature but would never participate in same-sex contact and that's fine, but it still puts you on the spectrum as far as I'm concerned. You can say your 100% straight but I might debate that not to be the case.   I would think that either openly gay and bisexual individuals may be consuming a monolith quantity of porn (seems unlikely) or people are WAY more fluid than we are aware of, and just too chickenshit to admit it on a grander scale. It's sad because it leads to a lot of homophobia and self-loathing.  The assumption that someone is inherently lesser, weaker, or going to hell (whatever) for being anything other than 100% straight is a exhausting trap, that keeps us in this closeted mentality. It just seems like we could be more honest with ourselves and others without fear of losing face if SO MANY people actually had this kind of bisexual (or whatever) potential, and the ridiculous witch-hunt would be obsolete."
bisexual,3cjwu2,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,2,Thu Jul 9 02:09:06 2015 UTC,I wonder if there are more women who watch gay porn than men who watch gay porn?  If this is the case I wonder if we will eventually see unrealistic gay sex that is akin to the lesbian porn that is made for men.  Also they categorize put all gay porn in one category. If the separated gay porn into categories like the do with the rest of porn you would see it much much lower.
bisexual,3cjwu2,Internetimal,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:03 2015 UTC,"Unsure if stating the obvious, but yaoi is literally that."
bisexual,3cjwu2,mjigs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I would expect it to be Much lower. So much in fact that I wouldn't have expected to see it in the top 10 in the first place."
bisexual,3cjwu2,beccabug,2,Thu Jul 9 02:45:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt take any porn site survey to conclude that, some woman like to watch gay porn, others would also enjoy lesbian porn, but that wouldn't make them bi, could be just fantasy or curiosity, as males like to watch hetero couples or lesbian but not gay, maybe just out of curiosity or because they're closet. But gay man would never watch any porn with any female...you see where im going."
bisexual,3cjwu2,beccabug,2,Thu Jul 9 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is, a lot of women actually DO watch gay porn. Just do a google. search in order to bring it up. Or you could go to the pornhub website and see how many female viewers actually comment on the MM videos.   I think that you're right to say that some people might check out the MM videos just out of curiosity, but I wouldn't speculate that it would be enough of a contribution to make it a top ten.   In my mind, if a guy is ""bi-curious"" but identifies more as straight, that's fine and I don't have a problem with that label, but I still see him on the spectrum between the binaries. Maybe a kinsey 1 or .5 if you will."
bisexual,3cjwu2,Vatnos,2,Thu Jul 9 12:22:15 2015 UTC,"People's porn habits are pretty indicative of someone's preferences imo, not always but pretty often. And while I'm sure there are more bisexuals out there than most people think, I also think people can label themselves however they want. If they feel they are straight, or mostly straight, then I'm okay with that bc that's what feels comfortable to them. They'll come to terms with it on their own time, or maybe they won't. Maybe they're just curious or adventurous. And maybe by us being more vocal, people can be more comfortable with non-binary sexual identities. And maybe more people will be okay with calling themselves bi.  I have a friend who I talk about hot girls with, who has had multiple sexy times with other women, and who is married to a man and has had plenty of man sexy times as well. I would call her bisexual, but she identifies as mostly straight. That's how she feels comfortable, and I think that's okay."
bisexual,3cjwu2,Vatnos,2,Thu Jul 9 05:44:07 2015 UTC,"I think that viewing habits are pretty indicative of preferences as well. I would definitly acknowledge that some viewing might be out of curiosity, though. Just not enough to really launch a genre to a top ten spot.   People can identify however they want though. It just seems like someone who identifies as straight yet has stated that they've enjoyed sex with people of the same gender leaves me kinda frustrated. It just doesn't seem to be entirely true. If you say you're bisexual people think you like both genders to the same degree, in the same way, at the same time. If you gravitate towards mostly straight there is a tendency to withhold divulging the bisexuality more. I know how embarrassing, and even dangerous it can be to talk about such things, and I wouldn't tell anybody to talk about it if it put them in a hostile situation, but at the same time, not talking about it and outright denying it kinda promotes the idea that there's inherently something wrong with it which I don't think there is."
bisexual,3cmswa,Super_Sloppy,3,Thu Jul 9 03:08:15 2015 UTC,I've started groups before. The biggest thing I'd suggest is too  think about what you need out of the group and cater to that. You have to be interested and passionate about it to keep putting energy into it.

I mean, it even says in the sidebar:    ""Rule 1: No homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, racism, serophobia, or misogyny of any kind.""   Is there any particular comment that's brought this on? You could try reporting it to the mods of the subreddit in question. :)"
bisexual,3cmnjg,elevatorfairy,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:14 2015 UTC,I would suggest having an honest conversation with your girlfriend about the reason you are losing your attraction to her. I'm sure your fights are playing a part in this as well.  Try not to judge yourself. You feel what you feel. You are one of those bisexual people who do need to have multiple genders in their life in order to be sexually fulfilled.

bisexual,3clkxa,laserlord,6,Wed Jul 8 21:19:49 2015 UTC,"This all really depends on how you feel about it. After all you're (presumably) happily married, so for all intents and purposes it means absolutely nothing to anyone but you and your wife. I agree that it sucks to not tell people, but she's right that it's not worth telling anyone. It's none of their business who you're ok with getting in bed with, much less so if you're married."
bisexual,3clkxa,PyroMechanical,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:33 2015 UTC,Thanks you guys may be right. I'm having a hard time here. I told her and have been talking to people on here with the intent to be fully out eventually. I feel like if I keep it to myself I'm lying to people in a way. Another closeted bisexual. This stuff is depressing as hell. Why do i have to be like this
bisexual,3clkxa,PyroMechanical,8,Wed Jul 8 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"Don't think of it that way, dude.  If you care so much about the label then maybe there's a bigger issue here. You're allowed to be vocal about liking guys (i.e. pointing out hot dudes to your wife to see what she thinks) it's pretty normal and if anyone asks if you're gay, then you can explain it to them. Otherwise, keep on keeping on, live your life the way you want to live it, not the way you want others to see it. I know exactly how you feel about the whole lying thing, but that's more of a behavioral issue than one of actually lying to them. If you feel that way, you're likely lying to yourself by trying to control something that people might perceive as a gay stereotype. You don't need to care what other people think, do it (unless it's cheating on your wife, then don't)! Just do you. Not what someone else thinks you should be, or what you think people want you to be/perceive you to be, just straight up you."
bisexual,3clkxa,PyroMechanical,3,Wed Jul 8 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I needed to hear this."
bisexual,3clkxa,PyroMechanical,3,Wed Jul 8 23:38:54 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I can't be open so I express myself in little victories, like calling out my parents on homophobic things they say, as well as  here, online. It's really helped the past week to be able to express myself to someone and know I won't be judged, so welcome to the club!"
bisexual,3clkxa,Maxeus86,3,Thu Jul 9 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've always been pretty vocal against homophobia myself, having parents that are phobes can be really difficult, because you want to tell them that they are saying horrible things about people like us, their own kids. I'm going to take that as a lesson in raising my own children."
bisexual,3clkxa,entropoid,2,Thu Jul 9 01:13:30 2015 UTC,"I hope to as well, if I ever have them! Tolerance and acceptance should be important, and it really shows how backwards people can be when religions that preach love and acceptance have some of the most hateful people of all."
bisexual,3clkxa,Maxeus86,3,Thu Jul 9 02:10:03 2015 UTC,"The label is for you, not so that acquaintances know how to categorize you. I came out to my wife and that was the end of it for me. At this point it just isn't anyone else's business. If I was single I would probably come out publicly, but as a married man my sexuality is between me and my wife."
bisexual,3clkxa,Maxeus86,2,Thu Jul 9 01:45:21 2015 UTC,"Similar, but I've told several others one by one so that they're people I can talk to. It's probably no coincidence that only one of them is a straight guy -- in my view the most likely group for the downsides to outweigh the upsides -- and that one I knew up front would have no trouble and indeed said he was honored and I believe him. Point being, I agree that there should be a good reason."
bisexual,3clkxa,cripplesmith,2,Thu Jul 9 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, there are a few people that I have told because I felt that either it would help them to know (like a friend who is struggling with his feelings for men) or because I needed someone to talk to."
bisexual,3clkxa,Unicorn_Tea_Party,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:29:30 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons this is an issue at all is because bisexual men are underrepresented. I love my wife, and respect her opinion. That doesn't make this easier for me because she is completely straight."
bisexual,3clkxa,BlueBerryJazz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that bisexual men are tragically under represented, but in my situation the fallout from coming out would far outweigh the benefits.

My recommendation from experience: don't do it. Not worth it.   If you want to stay married but also want to explore your bisexuality, you need to talk to her about it. Tell about what you're feeling and desiring. There's a chance she would be in to letting you explore that side of yourself, or maybe even explore it with you. There's also a chance she would be completely against the idea.  The important thing is that you talk to her about it. Bottling these feelings up is going to hurt your marriage one way or another.  Just don't do anything behind her back. If you love her (which I'm assuming you do because you married her) the pleasure and release you get from an affair won't even hold a candle to the pain of knowing that you're betraying someone who's trusted their entire life to you."

bisexual,3cl329,rab0t,7,Wed Jul 8 19:33:02 2015 UTC,"You've got to talk to  her. Your only option is to frankly (and gently, and kindly) discuss your feelings, your needs and desires, and try to find a way to meet her in the middle. She might be more open than you'd think to bringing someone else into the bedroom, or getting involved with swingers, or just opening your relationship within the confines of guidelines that make her feel comfortable and trusted.   You also have to be prepared for the fact that she may not want anything to do with this, and may feel betrayed anyway. But as an adult, and as someone who purportedly cares about her enough to have married her and fathered her child, it's your responsibility to take her feelings and her trust into account.   I hope you manage to work with your wife so that you are both satisfied in your relationship!"
bisexual,3cl329,rab0t,3,Wed Jul 8 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! I know talking to her is the right thing to do, rather than betraying her.   There was a point in our relationship where we'd dirty talk and even sometimes talk seriously about brining another guy in the bedroom, however it was not for me, it was for her since it was a fantasy of mine to have a 3some with her.  I think that helped open up the door for the ""bi"" discussion, and perhaps would be best brought up while ""dirty talking"", that way she doesn't immediately take it serious. Who knows, it might turn her on...   Thoughts?"
bisexual,3cl329,cripplesmith,4,Wed Jul 8 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great plan, and a MUCH better idea than sneaking around behind her back (for your sanity as well)! Please do  make sure that you're respecting her needs and desires too, and that you don't lose sight of her feelings in your quest to get your own needs met. I know firsthand how overwhelming sexual desire can be, but it's imperative to bring her into that part of your life, too, as the woman you're married to. It sounds like there's a way to keep honoring your commitment to her without denying your sexuality, especially if you broach this topic by making it clear that you want her to fully enjoy her own sexuality, and your own, as well. Make sure to include her as much as you can in this part of your life so she feels valued and respected.   Not sure if this is TMI, but you might also consider some genderplay in the bedroom to satisfy some of your desires. Strapons are a thing, is all I'm saying."
bisexual,3cl329,biq-mo,7,Wed Jul 8 19:42:59 2015 UTC,Being bi is not a free pass to be unfaithful.  Think about that.  You'll work out how best to handle this and be true to you - all of you.
bisexual,3cl329,biq-mo,3,Wed Jul 8 23:16:12 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you are from SLC based on your username. Are you Mormon? That might play into your anxieties as well. I am from a similar area and I have recently come out to my wife. I'm ex-Mormon so there was a lot of self discovery when I left the Mormon church and that is when I finally admitted to myself that I was bi. Just sit her down and talk to her and tell her your feelings. But do not cheat on your  wife. It will not make you feel any better in fact it will cause your anxieties to go through the roof.
bisexual,3cl329,Atheyna,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"I live in SLC Utah yes, but not Mormon. Nor is she. She is pretty open and can be kinky in bed when in the right mood... I recently came out to her about my foot fetish... More like she caught me looking at pics that were consistent with foot/feet shots. Female feet that is!   At first she thought it was weird and was mad, but now that she knows it's what I'm into, she helps make sure that she helps with those cravings by throwing in a foot job here and there, etc. haha   Maybe she would be open to it.  Maybe I just need to get her in the mood, pull out our box of dildos and see what happens next, hoping she suggests I put one inside of me.  Hopefully from there she'll consider eventually bringing another bi male into the bedroom to pleasure us both... Even though it doesn't seem likely.   I can get away with being pegged either, nothing the same as a real set of cock, balls, and a nice ass hole on a guy. The smell, feel, and taste... A dildo can't do that for me."

On the flip side, though, a lot of Supernatural fans actually love the cutesy winks at the audience, possibly even more than they would an actual romance. The writers really are giving many fans exactly what they want.   It was interesting in Xena, because they went the direction of strongly implying it, even though they didn't officially show it until the last couple episodes. If I recall, it wasn't so silly an cutesy, and it felt more respectful to the characters.  I always prefer it when a show either officially shows them as a couple (Santana & Brittany), or shows them as being in deep platonic love (JD & Tucker)."

Sometimes i forget that some people have real problems with this. Its sad because i wouldnt want to stop being bi for the world but others would trade anything to be straight
bisexual,3cj171,Antaeus663,4,Wed Jul 8 10:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people feel the same way as this guy. I don't think many women would have an interest in me if I told them I was bi. It's hard enough when they think you're straight.   However I'm inclined to think that more people are bi than actually account and identify as bisexual.   A pornhub survey shows that man to man porn was 7th most popular for male viewers. It's odd given that many reports show that only 1-3% of people have any same sex attractions.   Other studies show that homopohobes are more likely to be concealing same sex attractions. One report showed that 80% of homophobes and 30% of non-homophobes showed physical arousal to man on man pornographic material despite their denial of such. It's strange to think of that when, in my experience, see that most people seem to be homophobic, and then extrapolate those numbers to the population.  the 1-3% stats don't make sense in light of all this other information.  A lack of knowledge of the spectrum of sexuality and the stigma of society simply keeps us closeted."
bisexual,3cj171,CapriciousSon,3,Wed Jul 8 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"I think this is why there are almost no bi male role models (even Bowie won't REALLY come out) so all these men feel totally isolated.  I didn't feel comfortable until I met a bisexual girl who helped guide me through my anxieties.

bisexual,3cgca1,animatedradio,22,Wed Jul 8 19:55:31 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of Shane.  I've never been offended by his material but its never been my sort of humor.  However this is probably the best coming out explanation I've ever heard.  He was more relatable than most about it.  Especially his goal to not make it his entire identity hit home.  I feel most Youtubers who come out use it to their advantage afterwards and it doesn't sound like he'll be doing that.  Really glad to see him figuring this stuff out!  :)
bisexual,3cgca1,theimpossiblesoul,6,Wed Jul 8 06:02:14 2015 UTC,Holy shit this hit home. All of those feels...   I hope he inspires others to be more comfortable with who they are.

I remember him always seeming to be a genuinely nice, down to earth guy and he gives me the same impression now. I don't recall him ever saying anything outrageously offensive, but even if he did he just never struck me as the kind of guy who would mean any of it-that's just his brand of humor. I could be wrong though, I haven't followed him in ages. Regardless of that, I'm glad to see him doing well and coming to terms with these feelings. I think I may go back to watching his videos now."

Like another person said earlier in this thread this is mostly a win maybe for white bisexuals, but Shane Dawson has shown many times to be awfully racist. And that's suppose to be looked past because he happens to be a part of the LGBT community?"
bisexual,3cgca1,plsanswerme18,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:20 2015 UTC,"Some people in this thread need to learn about intersectionality. Race, class, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc all matter in how people are treated and perceived.  Not here to start up the oppression Olympics, but racist or otherwise offensive behavior from a famous person is worth discussing no matter how happy we are that they are our same orientation.  Example: Azealia Banks. Outspoken bisexual who in my opinion has good music, but has used LGBT slurs unapolpgetically. I'm not a fan of cis white male gays representing the whole community (which I think was the point she has tried to make) but being an asshole doesn't get you anywhere.  That being said: I'm glad Shane is on his way to figuring out who he is. And if he has used the backlash from that behavior to grow as a person, stop beating a dead horse."

bisexual,3cgca1,OutOfTine,15,Tue Jul 7 21:33:01 2015 UTC,we ain't talking about the cure for cancer tho.  we're talking about the fact that I'm supposed  to not be upset and to forget the fact that he used my skin color as a costume for entertainment and for YouTube money to celebrate him coming out.  I don't care how passionate the video was/is but I'm not gonna forget that fact because he's bi. doesn't excuse him at all.  everyone else can eat that up but I sure as hell won't.

No. His video is about coming to terms with sexuality and there's not a single off-color joke in it. What it is with you people who don't know how to compartmentalize shit?  There's a professor at my university who's rather famous for his literature denying a certain genocide in the last century. Students here like a decade ago tried to get him fired, and they failed. Because my school realizes that his opinions on race and history have nothing fucking to do with the classes he teaches. They go to his class, learn electrical engineering, and guess what? They don't come out out of the class as Nazis.  People need to learn to attack ideas, not people."

I'd like to direct you to this study that shows a a link between hostile humor (rape jokes) and aggression (victim blaming). Or this study that showed people who held bigoted beliefs became more aggressive towards people of that group after being exposed to jokes about them.   In other words, when we consider groups that most people discriminate against, and feel they are justified in doing so, disparaging humor towards that group does not foster discriminatory acts against them. On the other hand, for groups for whom the prejudice norm is shifting, and there is still no consensus not to discriminated against (women, gays, Muslims and so on), if you hold negative views against one of these groups, hearing disparaging jokes about them ""releases"" inhibitions you might have, and you feel it's ok to discriminate against them.   As for ""it's just a joke"", that's a lazy excuse for any off-brand humor. Comedy is meant for an audience, and making people feel uncomfortable is bad business as a person who relies on asses in seats (or subscribers/followers/views). I'm an entertainer, and my goal is to not alienate my audience. I make jokes about race, sexuality, gender...but I don't tell jokes that put down an entire group of people. I focus on irony and satire. Because as this study shows, I might not think that I'm bigoted for my joke, but those who hear it will think I am racist/homophobic/etc.  tl;dr: There's dark humor, and then there's bigotry. It's not fine because he's a comedian. Jokes do hurt people. These jokes do make you appear to be sexist, racist, homophobic, etc., even if you think you aren't."

He has a big audience so he is helping a lot of people figuring it out and at the same time he is helping bisexuals to get more awareness. I might be biased because I have watched him for years but I think we all agree that this video is awesome 😊"

Yeah, I forced myself to believe Shane's video about coming out as a bi but I just can't. Im afraid to say that its starting to be a trend and this is really upsets me cause your sexual orientation is not a thing for brag or prove that you are unique. My thoughts abput Shane is not positive, like he is doing this for his fame and no one should do this. This is serious. If he is really telling the truth IM SORRY, I REALLY AM but I just cant be sure if he is honest or not."
bisexual,3cgca1,plsanswerme18,30,Tue Jul 7 22:05:31 2015 UTC,"Now, as much as I dislike Shane, I don't think he's being insincere. Sexuality is most definitely not a trend, and you're doing more harm than good by claiming it could be, you know? Coming out as anything, especially bisexual, especially as a male, is fucking difficult. Do I think the recent coming out videos provided him with a good opportunity for doing so himself? Most definitely, but I think they provided him more so with encouragement, than you know, a good video idea."

He's already an established youtuber so he doesn't need the extra attention. This won't make people subscribe but it will make them unsubscribe. If he would have said he was gay then you wouldn't have second guessed him. I don't even like him bc he's super unfunny imo but God does it make me mad when people say that bi people are lying about being bi.

bisexual,3cgca1,umacilar,-1,Tue Jul 7 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"before they broke up he mentions he was very depressed and needed a break, so maybe lisa was just trying to be supportive?"
bisexual,3cgca1,ariana_mcclair,8,Tue Jul 7 23:07:41 2015 UTC,Right he was depressed. Which is common with bisexuality. What does that have to do with you thinking he's doing this for attention?
bisexual,3cgca1,umacilar,-6,Tue Jul 7 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"Listen, Im not saying that ""Im sure he is lying"". In the past he did tons of stuff for more attention, even racism. If he really is honest then good for him, accepting youself is a hard thing to do and coming out in front of thousands people is way harder that I cant imagine. I am just not sure about his honesty, its just it. Nothing else."

bisexual,3cimgp,IUPACnerd,3,Wed Jul 8 05:03:01 2015 UTC,"I really love making close and deep connections and friendships with males    This leads me to think you are very much an intellectual/emotional romantic, someone who needs to form a connection with the mind before the body reciprocates. In our fast paced world that can be difficult to allow time for those feelings to develop and many people (especially men, speaking as a man) will expect things to progress physically quicker than you are ready? That is really difficult. My only suggestion would be to try and form those deep connections/friendships with women and see if that leads anywhere? IE you can see the beauty in a woman’s physical form, perhaps let go of your ideas about traditional relationships and see if you can find a girl to connect with."
bisexual,3cimgp,TuskenCam,2,Wed Jul 8 05:24:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I am unfortunately VERY aware of our fast pace world. The second male that I kissed was this year, and when he pressured me to go further, I tried to explain my feelings (before I even had words for them) causing him to mistake my lack of sexual desire for abstinence and causing me to be being dropped like a hot potato (that was no longer hot to him..) I'll definitely look into your suggestion in regards to female connections, but in the past, they haven't proved to be too informative. Although the vast majority of my friends have been male, during high school I had one incredibly close female friend, but I was never able to see her as anything beyond a sister figure (possibly due to the fear of new identification, or maybe social pressures to find the perfect PRINCE charming) I will definitely give it more thought though! Thanks!!"
bisexual,3cimgp,BeesorBees,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"I can identify with the infrequent sexual urges, and I identify as demi, because when I am sexually attracted to someone I have an emotional attachment to them. But grey-ace makes sense to me too because it has happened very infrequently. Grey-ace is a good middle ground if you know you are capable of sexual attraction but it has happened so infrequently that you're not sure of who you're attracted to. Strong platonic feelings for men may be a sign of potential (grey)aromanticism, since you said you feel uncomfortable once these men confess attraction to you.  I don't have all the answers, but what I do know is that labels aren't for everybody. You have every right to identify however you want to (or not identify at all), and there's nothing wrong if you never have a label or if your labels change as you gain more experience."

bisexual,3cimgp,schrodingerorgsm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"I...dont want to be that guy, but screw it, everyone else here said the things regarding your question better. But I want to say something in a non-judgmental way. That shutting those guys out the instant they showed attraction to you can kind of fuck people up in the head. If you were that close to them, I think you should at least try to send them a message of explanation or something. If not, whatever. It might've been years ago and I ain't judging. But if it was recent, you should try to at least offer an explanation that its not them, its your own approach(or lack thereof, I suppose) to sexuality. It might not seem like much, but it could serious help their self esteem if they're not confident. Just my un-asked for two cents...  Edit: And one more thing. Believe it or not, most people can have a friendship without it turning into a whinefest over the ""friend zone"". Just means being honest and not disrespectful. I mention this because you make it sound like they were close friends. And I also speak from experience having dealt with both kinds of rejection. The girls who said ""sorry but I'm not interested"" I wound up having more respect for because they were polite about it, and I moved on. The ones who did what you did I kind of lost respect for and started to resent. It just hurts a lot. Sorry, not trying to be an emotional twat, it just stuck out sorry."

I plan on telling my mom at some point because I know she'll love me regardless, and eventually I will tell my father because it's the only way he will learn about who we are and why we matter."
bisexual,3ch202,Mutual_Death,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"That's how I play it as well. I be myself and if it comes up, it comes up. If not, then oh well. I never hide it and I never feel the need to explain myself."

bisexual,3ch202,rab0t,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Initially I discussed it with the one other person who I knew was bi via a series of letters (she was my ""lightbulb moment"" for putting a name to what I was feeling!), and then I think I told the boy I was dating at the time, who was happily super chill about it. I believe I told my little brother next, then friends I trusted (and one cousin) as the years progressed. I think I told all of them during face to face conversations (nerve wracking!). When I was 19 I came out to my parents at the insistence of the person I was dating at the time. Bad move haha. Since then, I've mostly let folks know if I trust them and it comes up in conversation."
bisexual,3ch202,Definetelynottom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:49:20 2015 UTC,"Four of my friends with texting. The first guy was kind of surprised, second took it in his stride, third didn't care either and came out as bi/pan himself, fourth didn't know what to say. All up, everyone was supportive. Then I told my parents. They were supportive but pretty much believe it's a phase.  Next up... Everyone else."
bisexual,3cgb8m,throwawayfastsyoucan,4,Tue Jul 7 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"The first question I would ask is do you WANT to explore?  For some people, it's very important, for others, it's like realizing you could have been happy with a blonde or a brunette: having the capacity for both doesn't mean you need to try both to be a complete person; it just means that you would love the person you're with regardless of their gender.  Try not to pay too much attention when people tell you that being bisexual means you will feel an inescapable desire for something someday: it's insulting to tell a woman who's childfree and wants to stay that way that she'll obviously change her mind.  Ask what YOU want.  Do you want to try relationships with men?  Do you just want to try sex with men, but without sacrificing your current relationship?  Or are you happy with the way things are right now?  There's no wrong answer, as long as you're honest.  Everyone is wired differently, and what's crucial to one person may mean nothing to another: it's okay to be happy exactly as you are."
bisexual,3cgb8m,hyzenthlay1701,2,Tue Jul 7 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"I would like to try a relationship with a guy, but I don't think I could at the expense of my current relationship.   Thanks for the advice. It really helps just to have somebody tell me this."
bisexual,3cgb8m,abyssinicum,4,Wed Jul 8 02:10:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other comment: You have to decide for yourself if exploring your interest in men is important to you, or if you'd be just as happy if you didn't do that.  I (a lady) am in a semi-open relationship with my boyfriend already, so I can explore my interest in other women without it affecting this relationship or hurting my bf. But not every relationship is the same way; pure monogamy is just as valid, too.  The way you proceed will depend on whether your relationship will be able to open up a bit, and if not (meaning if it stays monogamous), how important exploring your same-sex interests are to you.  Good luck, dude."
bisexual,3cgb8m,Jeredward,4,Tue Jul 7 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"I think the previous comments are valid; no one here can tell you what's best for you.  I am a 32yo male and have had two serious girlfriends, but have never done anything with a guy.  (But I like gay porn, so there must be something there.)  My last relationship ended about a year ago, but when I was with her, I was committed to her.  I wasn't even interested in anyone else (male or female); she was all I wanted.  Now that we're broken up, my curiosity is growing and--if the opportunity presents itself to date a guy--I will take it and explore that part of me.  But I would never have done it when we were together.  ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"", so to speak.  And she was a great girlfriend; I wouldn't want anything to jeopardize that.  But that's just me."
bisexual,3cghru,SpecialSauceSal,7,Tue Jul 7 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""split attractions"" model (wherein sexual and romantic attractions, sometimes as well as aesthetic, platonic, etc. attractions are all distinguished) makes a lot of sense for a lot of people, especially many bisexuals. (ETA: And asexuals, as /u/BeesorBees points out. This idea is very common in the ace community, since there are lots of allosexual aromantics and alloromantic asexuals.) I know some people don't like it because it makes it easy to justify internalized homophobia (""sure, I can fuck dudes, but I'd never want to like, hold hands or anything gay like that..."") and it can make it seem like people who avoid distinguishing their attraction this way are only interested in sex. (If I identify as bisexual, but you identify as a bisexual heteroromantic, then it sounds like I'm just forgetting about romance and am just a sex-having caricature of a queer.) But if it works for you, I say go for it and keep thinking about it that way, at least as it pertains to your own life and experiences. Sounds like you're still bisexual either way (or bisexual biromantic, if you want to split it up that way) but with leanings in opposite directions on either axis, which is totally a thing."
bisexual,3cghru,JustusGS,6,Tue Jul 7 19:27:46 2015 UTC,It makes sense for me coming from an ace spec perspective. A lot of people on the ace spec (and the bi and pan specs) have different sexual and romantic orientations.
bisexual,3cghru,BeesorBees,7,Tue Jul 7 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"i'm exactly the same way! in general, i'm so much more aroused by women than men, but once in a while there will be a guy i'm super into. romantically, i'm far more likely to fall for a guy, but once in a while there's a girl i'll be gaga for. it doesn't really matter in the end though, because the people that i'm into both romantically and sexually do exist, though they are few."
bisexual,3cghru,artichokess,4,Tue Jul 7 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"I like the notion of romantic and sexual relations being different.  Not having had any gay experiences (romantic or sexual), I guess its hard for me to say for certain.  However, I would say that I'm more likely to be romantically attracted to women (two girlfriends/zero boyfriends) and sexually attracted to men (at least, I prefer gay porn to straight porn, and really don't get off to lesbian porn at all).  But, that doesn't exclude men entirely from a romantic relationship, nor does it exclude women entirely from a sexual relationship (although, I've never had a sexual relationship; I've only been comfortable having sex with someone I know very well)."
bisexual,3cghru,Jeredward,5,Tue Jul 7 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the exact opposite of you,  OP. I like girls sexually more most days, but I just love love being in a relationship with a guy way more. Quite a paradox to square mentally. It's like a mind fu€king catch 22 for me anyway."
bisexual,3cghru,thejoker4059,2,Wed Jul 8 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"Most of my sex dreams and sexual thoughts are about women, but I am much more likely to get into relationships with men (I wouldn't say I can't get into them with women, but that just isn't the way my personal life has worked since I didn't realize I was into some of my high school best friends that way)  On a general level I find women more attractive, but I have formed really strong romantic and sexual bonds with men, including my current partner, who I love more than anyone. The bisexual girls I have wanted to date are with men and one chose a dude over me. Le sigh.   I self identify as bisexual biromantic with a het slant in practice."

With a woman, I'm deep-voiced and authoritative, generally. I didn't used to be, but I've had enough requests from girls that I be aggressive that  it's become almost second-nature."

Opposite of what I initially thought: I start low but then go a little higher at the end with girls and stay low (bottoming) with guys. My voice doesn't really go very high though.

As for whether or not you're bisexual, I would definitely say that you're not 100% straight.  You're also definitely not 100% gay.  Past that, it's really hard to say.  I wouldn't worry too much about whether or not you're gay or bisexual or straight.  I'd focus my efforts just on figuring out what I like and how my mind and body work.  Once you get a start on understanding yourself, things become a lot easier and a lot more apparent."
bisexual,3chb8o,Unicorn_Tea_Party,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"There is a such thing as being fluid in your sexuality, as well as only discovering you aren't straight relatively late compared to everyone else. I love the saying 'Labels are for soup cans,' since it really illustrates how superficial it is to feel pressured to use a specific term to describe your sexuality. Using Bi for me is just a convenient way to tell people that I like both, and you can do the same if you decide to come out to anyone. That said, if you're okay with it, experiment! try things and see if you like them, and if you do or don't you'll be learning more about yourself! So long as you're safe about it, it should be really good for you to figure your secuality out! You do you!"

Honestly, I don't understand why these people cannot understand the idea that maybe God doesn't actually give a shit about people's sexuality, especially considering that he made us how we are etc and that if he hates us for how he made us, maybe he isn't all that worthy of our worship after all.  For clarification, my position on God is basically that he probably exists, but I see no reason as to why that should govern my life."

But with guys, I just put down what I want to say."
bisexual,3cdqeg,TheTrashBin22,2,Tue Jul 7 15:24:11 2015 UTC,It depends on the person. With bigger guys I get hyper-submissive and feminine. I tend to be more submissive I general though. I take my cues from the other person but I prefer submission. Its specific to the individual.

bisexual,3ccgsv,Amorine,4,Tue Jul 7 00:34:08 2015 UTC,It can also mean that those who are bi are more reluctant to be honest with physicians or counselors and in turn can't get the full range of help.  There is also less of a community support as those who are bi are not always welcomed in the GLBT community.
bisexual,3ccgsv,schrodingerorgsm,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:17:04 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point, actually.  Any sexuality not accepted in the mainstream is more likely to face prejudice or misunderstanding. Not that being bi is wrong or is discriminated against heavily, but it is not as accepted as straight up gayness.

bisexual,3ccgsv,punkist1984,2,Tue Jul 7 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so there are a few things here that have to be teased apart.   First, the health is self-reported. So, it is entirely possible that Bis are no less healthy than anyone else, but perhaps depression makes them see themselves as less healthy. Perhaps rather than higher rates of poor health overall, this study actually indicates a higher rate of pessimism and self loathing among bi people.  Either way, I would guess either the lower rates of over all health or the higher rates of depression may be a product of not coming out, the confusion of not being able to say ""gay"" or ""straight"", not fitting in anywhere really (even in the LGBT community), not being trusted by gays or straights, treated like fucktoys for people who want threesomes, treated like we are oversexed people who do nothing but fuck constantly by the media, or treated like we don't actually exist at all and are just a bunch of liars by basically everyone.   One also has to wonder if a family's financial situation and health has any effect on their offspring or potential offspring. That might explain some of these differences as well.   All of this is well worth testing and I'm glad that Bi people aren't simply being lumped in with everyone else, which greatly skews the data."

bisexual,3ce67m,Mutual_Death,4,Tue Jul 7 06:46:05 2015 UTC,Labels can be convenient though. It's easier to say a label then to go into what you like and what you don't if sexual orientation is brought up in casual conversation.
bisexual,3ce67m,amethyst_specter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. It helps to ""dumb it down"" for people who don't understand.

bisexual,3cfhk5,hyzenthlay1701,2,Tue Jul 7 14:49:42 2015 UTC,"I think to the extent that those differences can be useful, they can be described in open-ended qualitative language rather than trying to pin us down to one or more scales like an online personality quiz."

You've got the kinsey scale measuring attractiveness to binary genders, you've got the romantic/sexual attraction dichotomy, the ace spectrum, fluidity, attraction to androgyny vs. hyperfeminine/hypermasculine, attraction to genital anatomy vs. real gender, poly vs. mono, etc, etc, etc...  Any measure that helps encourage more discussion is a good thing, though, and I'm always glad to see someone putting thought into it."
bisexual,3cfhk5,abyssinicum,2,Tue Jul 7 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Good points and very reasoned response. No one has to deal with new labels, it's just that bisexual doesn't really say a whole lot, so further simplifying language is always nice.

bisexual,3cfhk5,CourierOfTheWastes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, I would not find this subset useful.  For me, bisexual means that I'm attracted to more than one gender. That's it.

bisexual,3cdx6j,BrokenDesires,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:50 2015 UTC,"Try sweaters whose sleeves cover half of your hands, like this. It's subtle but (IMO) it gives a delicate-graceful-cute vibe once You focus on the hands.  Trench coats come to mind as well. They are worn by men a lot, yet they tend to create a hourglass silhouette.  I'm simmilar to You though it doesn't have to do with my attraction to others. I've gotten aware I like to have a bith of both in my appearance (but not to the point I confuse the hell out of everybody/appear transgender), which is funny, since my face IS a mix of both."

And under jeans makes my butt look good) then I find straight leg jeans that fit not too tight not too small check out the rear to make sure the assets are still there. Then I find a top that's kind long (reaches to my pockets) and fits. I have a naruto shirt I love doing this with. Button on shirt are good for this look too"

Dating apps are kind of an interesting story for me. I tend to approach dating apps like ""window shopping"" in that I don't usually try to contact anyone, but like to occasionally browse when I'm feeling curious. I tend to use more gay-oriented apps in general like grindr, but when I use apps like tinder that include both sexes I almost always ignore all they guys and focus on the women.

bisexual,3calu1,Antaeus663,22,Mon Jul 6 12:15:27 2015 UTC,Straight people don't get to decide if calling someone a faggot is offensive or not. Biphobes don't get to decide that they're not biphobic. Racists don't get to decide if what they say is racist or not.  The effected marginalized group does. But I'm much more worried about Dan's savage transphobia.
bisexual,3calu1,UseMe4yourFleshlight,4,Mon Jul 6 13:14:33 2015 UTC,I didn't realize he was transphobic. That's interesting. I'll have to explore that.
bisexual,3calu1,OutOfTine,3,Mon Jul 6 14:44:23 2015 UTC,He said some stupid shit like 500 years ago but has since changed his views and has a different attitude. He isn't transphobic today afaik.
bisexual,3calu1,UseMe4yourFleshlight,4,Mon Jul 6 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"No he's repeatedly ""said stupid shit"" over years, even much more recently. He's also harassed a trans college student and done a bunch of other evil shit."
bisexual,3calu1,raptoricus,4,Mon Jul 6 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"What did he do? Are you talking about when the discussion he had during a (private) panel about trans-people potentially reclaiming the word ""tranny""?"
bisexual,3calu1,UseMe4yourFleshlight,2,Tue Jul 7 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"No. Although that wasn't a private panel but a public lecture(learn facts to). I'm speaking about that time last fucking year where he dead named, identified, and stalked a transperson who called him out on his transphobia in a smaller local paper."
bisexual,3calu1,raptoricus,2,Tue Jul 7 12:42:12 2015 UTC,"I realize now that it was unclear what I meant by ""private"". I was referring to the IOP's off-the-record policy (i.e. no one blogs/writes/tweets/etc. about what was discussed inside), which was clearly violated in this case. The internet is a little unclear as to the difference between a seminar and panel (I thought it had to do with the number of speakers, but apparently it has to do with the diversity of the subject matter); it appears that ""seminar"" was a better word to use than panel.   The inaccuracy of my language aside, I was really wanting somewhere to read up about his transphobia - Wikipedia didn't mention the incident."
bisexual,3calu1,cbrachyrhynchos,14,Tue Jul 7 17:55:24 2015 UTC,"Savage seems to have a chip on his shoulder about the issue, and goes out of his way to inject comments that bi activists are going to hate him into largely unrelated issues.   But for the most part, I stopped caring what he thought a while ago."
bisexual,3calu1,Vatnos,2,Mon Jul 6 13:55:37 2015 UTC,I won't deny that he has a chip on his shoulder. It's interesting to see how much clout he has lost with so many people. Thanks for your comment. :)
bisexual,3calu1,Mutual_Death,10,Mon Jul 6 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"Dan and others often bring up the 2005 Northwestern study  that couldn't find bisexual arousal patterns, saying those guys were gay... but I think that's a load of bull.  It's conveniently overlooked that a third of the bi men had straight arousal patterns(people keep saying they were ALL gay), and that 100% of the men responded somewhat to both types of porn, it just wasn't even. I personally think it was experience that made the difference between the first and second Northwestern study. They screened for bi guys who had concrete experience with both sexes the second time. I think the guys in the first one were less experienced with their attractions. They may have been bisexual but they may  have had much more experience with one sex that the other, and they were physically more easily aroused by that one. Whichever way they were leaning that day was the way they responded.  When I was first coming out, I was eager to use my ""new powers"". I was much more interested in same sex stuff. If you'd strapped me to a plethysmograph I might've looked gay as well. But then I had my straight moods, and if you'd tested me again a week later I might've looked straight--or at any point in the years leading up to my coming out."
bisexual,3calu1,Vatnos,8,Mon Jul 6 16:18:52 2015 UTC,"That's a great point. It's a common assumption that bisexuals are equally attracted to both sexes at the same time. That might be true of some individuals, but it is more commonly not the case. It's good to keep in mind that bisexuality is a potential be physically and/or emotionally attracted to both genders, though not necessarily to the same degree, the same time, in the same way, or for the same reasons. It's too subjective to the individual and varies widely between and within individuals. The lack of comprehension of this keeps people confused or in denial about bisexuality."
bisexual,3calu1,entropoid,4,Mon Jul 6 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! You've said it better than I could have.   People think of it as a superficial sexual attraction (and it may be for some, obviously) but it is just like any other attraction. For example, we can be attracted to a personality, no matter who it is attached to. At least, that's how I try to explain it to my straight pals."
bisexual,3calu1,The_Big_Ouchy,2,Mon Jul 6 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think it would be interesting to see a proper study looking at arousal over time. Not just on one day but on many days, to demonstrate how much it can change in a person.  Also, something Dan Savage will never point out... they show M/M and F/F porn in these studies instead of F/M porn because most gay guys show arousal to F/M porn--for many just as strongly as M/M porn. You don't see us going around calling them liars though do you? Personally I don't watch F/F porn much because I like penetration in my porn. If I want to look at the female body I just look at nude singles usually. I feel like having different arousal levels to M/M and F/F porn doesn't mean all that much. You really need to show a lot of other things to get a better picture of someone's automatic responses.  They also did a study looking at MRI patters for bisexual women, proving they had a different neurological response. A comparable study was never done on men and we really could use it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S5Z-nIH3kA  J Michael Bailey showing fMRI results from a bisexual man."
bisexual,3calu1,bluedaem0n,6,Mon Jul 6 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"As if porn were the very definition of sexual interest, anyway. I continue to find sex with women of more personal interest (by degree, of course) but like you I don't think much of F/F porn because, well, I prefer dicks in porn because dicks are neat. When having sex I can contribute one so all's well. Point being, which porn does it for me is not very indickative (ha, sorry) of my preferred behavior. Related, sure, but not the same. (Never mind indicative of actual experience, of course.)"
bisexual,3calu1,UseMe4yourFleshlight,4,Mon Jul 6 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is that the researchers picked what was shown and who's to say that they have any taste? :P         The whole study was reductionist, flawed, incomplete, and every level of biased and awful from a scientific standpoint that I am shocked that it was published in the first place. Even more-so that it was published in such an influential journal. How it passed the peer review process with anything more than a flat rejection is beyond me."
bisexual,3calu1,bluedaem0n,5,Mon Jul 6 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the post OP. Some of the comments here are a little embarrassing.  I don't cuss out my grandparents for saying stupid things about black people. We shouldn't cuss out Dan for acknowledging that some/many ""old gays"" didn't/don't think of bisexuality as an orientation, but a way to be at least partially out without suffering all of the social backlash at once. It was shittier to be gay back then than it is now.  He even ends the video by saying gay men should stop using our label as a stepping stone, and he adds on a bit at the end encouraging all bisexual people to come out, including those in opposite-sex relationships.  Why waste the indignant anger on friendly fire?"
bisexual,3calu1,Gallifreyan_fez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"Three things: * Dan Savage has harmed a lot of actual people. Not just with his words but with his hate mobbish following. Your grandparents likely haven't participated in actions that drove others to suicide, led to people having their whole lives unravel, become the victim of violence, etc. And if they did, and you haven't called them out on it, you're as bad as they are. But when you have the ears of hundreds of ravenous people that you can stir to real world action, and then you use it to target those that you dislike? Whelp, you might be Adam Baldwin or Dan Savage. * Maybe Hillary can change her mind on Gay Marriage. Maybe Dan Savage can change his mind on bisexuality. Does either really matter when they have done terrible things, and never apologized or noticing those, and hold backwards views that are also terrible? * He's hurt actual people, not just bi/pan folk but agender, transgender, nonbinary, asexuals, etc. I'm not willing to believe he's changed until he actually apologizes to people he has harmed and then to the groups. Then take down all the websites that he still has up preaching the various *phobias he's engaged in."
bisexual,3calu1,Gallifreyan_fez,0,Wed Jul 8 16:22:18 2015 UTC,"I had a hard time finding the actions or the websites you're talking about. He's used the word 'tranny' in the past, but as of 2011 he's stopped using the word as a slur. I'd argue that 'tranny' has not always been treated as much of a slur as it is today.  There are a lot of references to his appearance with Laverne Cox at University of Chicago. If anything, I'd be offended with Laverne allegedly misgendering the student without seeming to care.  Here's a good summary of the 'two sides' to that incident.  http://feminspire.com/a-letter-to-activist-dan-savage-who-continues-to-bully-my-trans-sibling/  http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/06/07/about-that-hate-crime-i-committed-at-university-of-chicago  His rhetoric is abrasive and callous and he's said some offensive shit in the past, but given everything he's said in support of the trans* community, it's just stupid to call him transphobic."

bisexual,3calu1,Gallifreyan_fez,2,Mon Jul 6 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to a large extent. There was a time where I resented him for his eye rolling attitude towards bisexuals, however the fact that he is not stagnant in his attitude and opinions is admirable."

bisexual,3ca43z,cyuun,2,Mon Jul 6 08:02:24 2015 UTC,"Bisexual is a broad term. If you have feelings for another person of the same sex you may be bi. In my experience I've found that few people are even 50\50 into male female and this could change. You don't necessarily have to take on a label but it's not a bad thing to try and figure these things out young. It could be that he is just your type, or that you have a crush or any number of things. The only person that can truly know how you feel about your orientation is you!"
bisexual,3ca43z,laserlord,2,Mon Jul 6 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"Just making out might not provide answers because if you don't have any special feelings for them, it still may not feel right.

bisexual,3ca43z,thetrexx,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think that kissing a random bi/gay male that you're not attracted to will help you to figure this out.  I think that sexual attraction is one thing, and then romantic attraction (which can include the desire to do sexual or affectionate things like kissing, hugging, spooning, etc) is something else entirely.  I can get a serious boner for someone I think is gorgeous and I can imagine doing sexual things with that person, even if they are a complete stranger, and that can be a turn-on.  Whether they are male or female, it is somewhat random for me.    I had a very intense physical sexual relationship with a girl when I was your age (I am also a girl - I know my use of ""boner"" probably was confusing).  She was my best friend, and we spent nearly all our time together.  I was very emotionally involved with her in addition to having great sexual chemistry.  She wasn't someone I would have looked at on the street, as a stranger, and thought ""wow, I'd like to have sex with her.""  I was her friend first, and our feelings developed into something more.  Then it didn't matter what she looked like, she was beautiful and sexy to me and I wanted to be with her.   So I would say do not rely on random same-sex encounters to determine if you are bisexual or not."
bisexual,3ca43z,green_carbon07,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"Just talk to him about it. The worst he'll say is no and then at least you'll have an answer. Labeling things never did anyone any good, just go with what you feel is right."
bisexual,3ca43z,Mutual_Death,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"I would suggest not forcing yourself to kiss someone just to ""find out"" but hey, who am I to judge?  Fitting your sexual orientation into a neat category shouldn't be a priority for you. You're so young and have much to experience. Just let your feelings unfold naturally and see what happens. Don't try to force it...and that goes with any relationship. And if you feel comfortable with yourself and your friend's reaction, tell him what you are feeling. It may work out and if it doesn't, at least you have another person to speak about your feelings face to face."
bisexual,3c9gus,1throw1away123,12,Mon Jul 6 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"It may be fulfilling a need but its still another human being that you have a level of care for. Its not meaningless - you get what you want, they get what they want, you share a connection regardless :) I have a FWB, he's my friend, I'm not going to have a bf/gf relationship with him, but I enjoy sex, he enjoys sex so we enjoy it as friends together without it being anything more. Its not meaningless though."
bisexual,3c9gus,StarCraftGirl,7,Mon Jul 6 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"If a couple got married, stayed together for 40 years without ever having children, then divorced, would their time together be meaningless? Just because something is temporary doesn't mean it can't be important or meaningful."

bisexual,3c9gus,Autumn-Moonlight,2,Mon Jul 6 07:16:13 2015 UTC,"The real kicker is you just need to find other people who see it from your point of view.  Are you looking for one-time only sex partners, or are you open to finding a playmate for the two of you who you'd play with more than once?  If the latter, do you become friends so you can do other things besides fuck?  Do the two of you possibly date her?  Are you nonmonogamous now or just experimenting sexually?  These are all things to consider.  Once you know where you're at, you can find someone who also wants that level of a relationship with you and your partner.  That perfect meshing of wants/needs is what keeps someone from feeling used."
bisexual,3c9gus,thaneofpain,2,Mon Jul 6 17:36:00 2015 UTC,Everyone has different feelings towards sex. Personally I do view sex with someone that I don't view as a partner as meaningless. But that is likely due to the fact that I have a relatively low sex drive.  But that doesn't mean that the same thing is meaningless for you.
bisexual,3c9gus,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,2,Mon Jul 6 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"People have sex with different people for different reasons - I think people who are monogamous centered tend to forget some people have sex with friends. It's not necessarily just to get off, I guess, but I can't find a good way to explain how a non romantic relationship can benefit from intimacy.  I'm the third for a couple right now. I was originally just looking for a girl to get more girl on girl experience with but we became good friends and I like her boyfriend too. Sex with them is really fulfilling because I admire them as a couple and as individuals.  I guess you would have to find a way to explain how friends with benefits is about more than just getting off."
bisexual,3c9gus,RoseSobriquet,2,Mon Jul 6 21:37:39 2015 UTC,"Well I guess there are 2 aspects to this  1)- having a genuine sexual connection with somebody & I guess this is what you are  trying to express - that you can have a genuine connection with somebody, regardless if it is temporary or permanent.  2) -liking somebody- and this is where the 'meaningless' part comes in- basically I am guessing your friends thought process is ""if you really liked this person, you'd want to see them again, rather than just having sex with them once"". So basically even if the sexual connection is genuine, it becomes 'meaningless' because it does not translate into other areas of life."
bisexual,3c9gus,bity-bite,2,Mon Jul 6 23:35:52 2015 UTC,"we like threesomes.  They are a) fun b) positive.  If you're bi - and we both are - we do both mmf and mff, and always with a bi ""third"".

bisexual,3c9gus,cripplesmith,2,Tue Jul 7 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"If fulfilling needs and desires is meaningless than isn't all sex between partners meaningless?  This is stupid.  The only leg your friend has to stand on is if that other woman is solely in your bed because she's a woman, and not because you like her, are friends with her, want to have her in your life. ALSO, importantly, what about that woman's agency? What if she likes you, wants to be with you, wants to share sexual intimacy with you and your partner. How is that invalid just because you all aren't primary partners?  Your friend lacks an imagination."

In addition, no matter where you live, there are LGBT resources and if you have not discussed the situation with them, you are missing a lot of potential help. Since you're being monitored so closely, go in person and conceal your calls.

There is however a time and place for everything, and it sounds like your situation might be really ideal, but it's a lot to have to navigate in a small chunk of time. My advice would be to try to slow things down a bit if you can. Especially when there's some potential New Relationship Energy going on, it can feel like you want to just jump head first into things, but that is when we often forget to communicate fully what we are feeling and what we are expecting to one another, and feelings can get hurt. Slow things down and keep communication open and honest. You might get the feeling like you're losing a little bit of the passion and spontaneity, but at least you won't be ruining friendships."

bisexual,3c8r0g,xthrowawayl0v3,6,Sun Jul 5 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"I think your boyfriend has a right to know. He might be ok with it if he knows about it, especially if you can set guidelines (maybe he's comfortable with talking and flirting but nothing else, whatever). If only for the sake of honesty, it's best to tell him. I'm a 19 year old bi girl too, so I definitely understand the feeling of wanting to be with a girl and missing that experience. But going behind someone's back can never go well, you know?"
bisexual,3c8r0g,theaxolotlgod,2,Sun Jul 5 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"What did you do in your situation (if you had a boyfriend etc)? I know he has a right to know and I will tell him eventually it's just bringing it up, what to say, when is the right time, etc!"
bisexual,3c8r0g,theaxolotlgod,2,Mon Jul 6 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't been in your exact situation, but I have talked to my boyfriend about my bisexuality and what it entails. For me, I talked about things like how my attraction is and what I want in a relationship in general (so, I'm generally more attracted to women than men, but it's all really individual, that I am happy with monogamy but would also be open to other kinds of relationships, etc) and said what I'd be comfortable with as far as indulging both sides of my attraction (personally, I could do anything up to and including an open relationship).  Then I asked my boyfriend how he felt about it (generally that he would be ok with one-off makeouts and/or threesomes, but that we would have to talk about it and address it on a case-by-case basis).  Then basically we talked about compromises, what was important and what wasn't (I'm personally not picky about specifics if there's some opening for me to fool around a bit, so I was fine with what he's comfortable with).  So in your case, I'd:   explain what's been going on (""I've been realizing I may be attracted to women, and to sort of explore that side I've been talking to women on tinder. I haven't done anything physical, just flirting and talking"" or whatever fits your situation most accurately, and of course apologize for not discussing it sooner) If you haven't already talked about your sexuality in general, this could be a good time! (So talking about what might interest you, how recent these feelings are, how they affect you, etc.) This gives him more insight into why you've been talking to girls on tinder, and why you want to do these things. It can be hard for people who have never questioned their sexuality to understand the process and how it feels, so explaining it is very important! If he's never wondered about being with a guy, he probably doesn't have a frame of reference to compare to your experience. say what you'd like (""I'm interested in the possibility of exploring this side of my sexuality by potentially [kissing a girl, hooking up, trying a relationship with a woman, what have you]"") Ask for his views (""How do you feel about all this? What kinds of boundaries would you like in the relationship, and what kinds of things are acceptable or not acceptable to you?"") Work it out together. Talk about what you can compromise on, what you need, what you and him are each comfortable with. Hopefully, you can find some compatibilities and figure out a dynamic that works for you!   Hopefully that was helpful, I'm no expert but I've discussed my bisexuality with a few different long-term partners and we've all worked out different things (surprisingly, the bi girl I dated was most rigid, while the straight guy I'm with now is a lot more flexible!) and I've found that it mostly just comes down to communicating how you feel, what you want, and how much you can compromise. If you have any more questions feel free to ask, otherwise good luck!"
bisexual,3c8r0g,techn0path,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I do appreciate your reply and that seems like a really straightforward way of going about it. Definitely need to give it a think over though, until then I won't be talking to any girls until I'm comfortable in my own mind with how I want to share my feelings. Thank you again!"
bisexual,3c8r0g,ToanDaxland,0,Mon Jul 6 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.. I'm a guy who feels like he missed out, it doesn't matter if you're talking to another girl or guy it's still another person. I would try talking to him about it don't give up too many details but enough to see how he feels. It's not completely cheating just flirting."
bisexual,3c8r0g,ToanDaxland,9,Mon Jul 6 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Biggest concern is that you're doing this and he has no idea.  It doesn't matter that it's a girl you're talking with, it's still another person. Unless you're into polyamory and so is he, you should really talk about it with him.  And yes, you should talk to him before you actually do something, not the other way around. It'll save you trouble later, and heartache and so on.  (On a side note, what is ""right""? Philosophical question for sure, but I'm not entirely sure I understand what is ""right"" to you.)  Probably just talk to him. Depending on how cheeky you want to go, you could bring up threesomes jokingly. Or just straight up tell him that you're bi-curious, and that you have needs, and go from there. I suggest the latter, but that's because I might be irresponsibly blunt."
bisexual,3c8r0g,jaynebshea,2,Sun Jul 5 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"I know you're right. It's just a confusing situation to be in because I don't want him to react badly, I want him to understand and be okay with it, but the thought of him saying he's okay when he isn't really hurts me :( but hopefully he would be honest.   I don't know what you mean by the ""right"" thing. Surely me being on Tinder and chatting to girls is wrong because it's without his knowledge, but I don't think it's as bad as going out and doing something behind his back, which I haven't and I wouldn't.   Those ideas are definitely good ones! I'll think it over and when the time is right see what kind of thing feels right. I reckon it'll be in a blunt matter though, he knows which kind of porn I watch so that's a starting point I guess! :')"

I came out to my partner on our second date and we have been together for 7 years now. After two years, we decided to date women together, since he recognized that I needed to do so in order to be my full and true self and express my sexuality as a whole. As far as how to bring it up to him, do you know his stance on bi/homosexuality in general? It would definitely be helpful to know that before you discuss yourself. Using a ""friend"" who is going through a similar situation often works well to gauge his feelings on your particular situation before you reveal it to him can help as well, if you don't want to just go for it."
bisexual,3c8r0g,Drake5271,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"Try talking to him. A surprising amount of people will be understanding. And if he isn't cool with it then you can always take a break from your relationship and experiment, because it sounds like that is what you want to do anyway.  Being curious is not wrong, it's the not telling him that is."

bisexual,3c6lyp,sirblastalot,2,Sun Jul 5 17:25:28 2015 UTC,Amazon reviews seem to cut it up pretty bad as just rants and diary entries while the author tries too hard to be PC and sounds immature. How accurate is this?
bisexual,3c6lyp,oryomai1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:52:00 2015 UTC,"Are you looking at a different amazon? It says that 58% of the reviews are 5-star reviews. And I don't think I've sent in a review myself.  I could see why someone wouldn't like this book for being ""too PC,"" but it is clear when reading that she is not trying to be ""PC"" as much as she has very solid personal principles for why she writes what she does.   I also don't understand why she ""sounds immature."""
bisexual,3c6lyp,sirblastalot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:34:05 2015 UTC,"The first chapter has a little tinge of that; the author goes out of her way to, for example, list all the ways in which she is privileged.  And, the author advocates completely dismantling certain social systems, rather than working to change them.  That stuff seems confined to the introduction, though.  The 2nd chapter has just been a really solid historical and scientific overview of different definitions of bisexuality, including some that I hadn't heard before, and whose connotations I really like."
bisexual,3c6lyp,oryomai1,2,Mon Jul 6 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that the book does take a very radical political stance, but I went into the book disagreeing with most of those political stances. I think it is worth reading even if you disagree on the outset because the arguments are interesting, compelling, and well supported. I don't agree that she ignores ""lived experiences"" though. If anything, she leans on ""lived experiences"" too much I think.  Also, though I would agree that this is no light reading, it's certainly not as ""academic"" as many people suggest. Compared to the stuff I read in college, this is both easy and interesting and not dry nor needlessly complex. Yes, the book is well-researched and a step deeper than say The Bisexual's Guide to the Universe or one of the bisexual anthologies, but for me that just makes this book more special.   Also, I'm not sure how much I sympathize with her being ""mean"" to you. I don't use tumblr, but I follow her on facebook. She is curt with people sometimes, but it's usually for good reasons. If you are genuinely and forthrightly curious, then she will be extremely persuasive and informative. If you are not, then she has no reason to spend the time helping you understand.   As for the ""witch-hunt"" thing, I really need more details (and a link preferably). Because--I'm going to be straight with you--I don't think I really believe you."
bisexual,3c6lyp,sirblastalot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I started this book, but I'm not in love with it yet. The beginning seems just so vocabulary heavy that I'm not sure it will get interesting. Does it?"
bisexual,3c6lyp,HedronCat,2,Mon Jul 6 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"The first chapter is a little meh.  I'm part way through the second chapter, and it's very empowering and insightful."
bisexual,3c6lyp,madame_mayhem,2,Sun Jul 5 18:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know. The vocabulary of the book isn't actually that wide, but she does front-load a lot of it. I would recommend googling words you don't know that aren't defined in the book. You probably won't have to google anything after the first chapter. Or you could try skipping those words--you'll probably understand them via context later anyway.   And I strongly agree with sirblastalot. If you can hold out until the second chapter, that is when the empowering, insightful stuff really starting hitting hard."
bisexual,3c6lyp,bernardryefield,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've run into any words I was totally unfamiliar with yet, but it almost felt like an entry-level gender studies textbook at the beginning?

Kinsey only had about 2,500k males who engaged in same and opposite sex activity in his entire sample, and fewer who would rate at a 2-4 on his scale."

It's from people who want to help, who recognize we're a minority within a minority and want to show others that we -do- face stigma and -don't- have privilege, compared to gays. This is a good thing to see and you all shouldn't interpret it as an attack.  Our mental health is worse on average. That's not because of our sexuality but because we go through the same turmoil having to come out, having to reconcile our with our sexuality, and when we come out there isn't a big happy welcoming community unrolling a red carpet for us. There isn't a support network and our sexuality isn't seen with the same level of legitimacy in the media. And because we frequently date people with different orientations, we frequently come into contact with negative opinions. The increased drug use and depression is caused by this, and it's not surprising in the slightest."

bisexual,3c5ryu,BlerptheDamnCookie,11,Sun Jul 5 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"Really, truly, the first thing you should do is stop worrying about and overthinking all of this so much. I wasted years of my life overanalyzing my sexuality, and I would love to have that time and energy back (for something like, say, exploring my sexuality -- or literally any other hobby or interest or thing I enjoyed). Based on my own experience, I recommend working hard in school and going to college in a big city away from where you grew up. That will give you the space you need to enjoy finding out who you are. Don't torture yourself; the best revenge you can have on your bullies is not caring at all about them and whatever they've done. Forget it if you can. Forgive them their ignorance, if you're having a really great day. You're fine, and they don't deserve you in their lives.  I think you should make that infographic you mentioned, because it'll give you an outlet for your thoughts about all of this. You may learn some uplifting things in making it that'll help you feel less alone. :)  And yes, I absolutely struggled to tell whether I wanted to be, befriend, or be sexual with the people I liked. Attraction is attraction; trust me that you'll figure out how you want to pursue a given situation with experience and attentiveness to yourself. You certainly don't need to come up with a bunch of rules right now. If nothing else, I can promise you that you're not done growing and changing, nor will you ever be. Try to relax and enjoy the ride."
bisexual,3c5ryu,HedronCat,5,Sun Jul 5 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"Yes this, OP! Being bi isn't quite as easy as being gay or straight - I mean that tongue in cheek: as a sexuality bi is much more a combination of varied inclinations than it is a particular set of characteristics.   If you like the identifier bi, use it. If not, you don't have to. Instead of identifying as bi I used to just leave myself implied straight, but it did feel wrong using the term so I tried not to use any terms until I figured out how I felt.   Now I identify as bi. It's complicated but it fluctuates enough that I know monosexuality isn't my thing. I've felt like a stereotype before, but what helps is finding others that feel the same way and realizing this isn't a phase or a trend for you, and other bi people totally get it.  As far as ""am I really attracted to this person?"" being bi doesn't have much to do with it. I've always struggled with that distinction with people of both genders, it's very different when you find someone you really want to be close to.  As far as bullies I can't really help, but hiding my thoughts and feelings is very hard for me, so it's up to you to know what really matters in how you think and act, and who is in your life and if they deserve it."
bisexual,3c5ryu,helloily,2,Sun Jul 5 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"How can I identify other bi people? There are no Bi spaces here where I am and probably there is some LGBT stuff but I won't go there since I feel I could see/get seen by someone and they won't care enough to ask why I'm there,  just spread the word.

Sometimes helpful, others downright exhausting.  Can I still hang around here, labelled or not? I like the relaxed atmosphere and I think You guys are more understanding-relatable that completely straight/gay subs. If not, that's okay as well, I enjoyed the visit.  Do Yoy have any tips to relax while being secretive?. I don't have anyone to talk about this (thought of someone but a conversation about a certain guy came up recently and I'm back to zero. I said ""Oh I thought he confessed being bisexual"" and she said ""Nah, He's gay and trying to cover it up. He get's a 'girlfriend' then breaks up with her 3 days after or so. He should own it""... then ""Gay people deserve respect like other people. I mean. What is that bisexuality thing anyway? It just seems dirtier than the other"".

bisexual,3c5ryu,ADigitalWinter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"You've got my extreme sympathy there. Are you familiar with mindfulness techniques? Recognizing when you're overthinking takes practice, but it becomes much easier to handle once you can notice and stop yourself. (""I don't need to think about this right now."") This could be a good goal to work towards to help occupy your mind.  I'd be happy to have you here, but man, you don't need my or anyone else's permission. Check out the sidebar, and I'm fairly confident you'll see ""everyone is welcome."" Labels can be helpful, but you don't need them to participate in a community. If you think you belong here, you probably do. :)  You're already practicing my first suggestion: reach out online, read about and talk to like-minded, supportive folks. We are definitely here, even if you can't find us easily where you live. It sounds like your friend means well but just doesn't know about other sexualities; however, it's not on you to teach her or put yourself at risk if you're not ready. Try not to resent her, as odds are good she'll learn eventually. (Respecting gay people is a good first step, and one many in my childhood community couldn't seem to take.) You might reach out to the guy in question, but if you don't know him well otherwise, I'm not sure I'd give someone my secret based on a rumor about him.  My other suggestions for getting comfortable with your secrets: make jokes about them to yourself. I've been in many stressful situations in my life, but I haven't yet found one that laughter didn't improve. Do other things to help build your confidence. What are your talents, hobbies, other interests? Spend time on those. Remember that one day, you will share your secret with someone who thinks it's great; work on being the best you that you can be -- including confident and happy -- so you're ready to meet that person."

I think I'll stay then :)  See, here's the funny thing. This friend is a 46 year old religious woman (she could be my mother). She's my neighbour and her daughter and I are good friends as well but I mostly talk with the mom. When such subjects come up, You can sense by her change in tone of voice that she doesn't really want to know about it in depth. It becomes ""too much"" and she tries to drive the convo somewhere else.  It's pretty much ""I admire gays and how they are so gorgeous and dress magnificently"" and ""gays are people and I don't like when people mock them. I taught my daughter to not do that, to love their friends"" but that's it. Being that age, I srsly won't try to correct her, You know how adults become set in their ways at some point and whatnot.  Funny her daughter (17) told me a few months ago she gets somewhat curious about other girls from time to time but to keep it as a secret (which I do).  Oh god no hahah. That guy is a mess (it's a friend of the daughter). Gay, bi or whatever, He's very gossip-oriented and we really don't have anything in common so it would be pointless, or potentially harmful to me.

Want to be friends? haha  Anyways, questions, were they meant to be answered? I'm answering them.  1) That's... shit, it's the same that happens to me, but to my understanding, some people feel actual sexual attraction- ""I would fuck him/her even if I haven't heard them say a word/ they're assholes but they're hot"" kind of way... huh. that didn't answer much, did it? I'm moving on to the next one.  2) For what I've seen here and in other bi communities around the web, it is common among bisexuals at least. (I could be wrong) I doubt it's a dissorder, probably just jealousy and striving to be/feel attractive to both others and to like oneself?   3) Possibly, I mean, we all want attention on some way or another. I've been getting that currently now that I moved countries and am alone and some girls want to be friends and I have to consciously remind myself that they're straight, and that I can't afford fuck up in this small-ass city. What I mean is that yeah, it happens. One (misinterpretates? is that a word? you know what I mean) things when we lack them for a while.  4)Probably depends on the woman, I wouldn't know enough to give generalizations.I would guess maybe they might be more open to it, though.  5)skipping this one.  6) Would like it very much, yeah!  7) Everyone has their own way to deal with things, man. Mine, if it isn't obvious, is over-analizing everything. Feeling like a walking stereotype is no fun haha. If you can't tell anyone in real life, this community is pretty nice, or the internet in general. At the end of the day, people are the result of their enviroment, you know? it isn't your fault, it is not wrong to be something outside the lines, even if the people around us disagree, even if we have to keep it sealed in a box, it is not ""crazy"" and it is not something we can blame ourselves for.

bisexual,3c45ws,aromatic_everything,17,Sun Jul 5 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think asking him to read this Cracked article may be a good place to start?  I'd also suggest that, just because there are other minority groups having a worse time, it doesn't make another minority group's suffering any less real or meaningful.  There are always people having a worse day/week/life than you.  It shouldn't invalidate your feelings about your own experiences.  Everything is subjective.  There are people who have a terrible time out there thinking trans people have nothing to complain about, too.  It doesn't give them license to dismiss their suffering."
bisexual,3c45ws,petiteneko,13,Sat Jul 4 19:46:05 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Suffering isn't a pissing contest to see who has it worse; it's about what matters to each of us individually and our ability to care about each other, even if we cannot fully empathize with one another's suffering.  I'm a bi brown girl, but that doesn't mean I should trivialize an LGBT white person because I've had to deal with racial problems on top of coming to terms with my sexuality. Nor does it mean someone in a worse environment (I'm still in California which is a super welcoming place for all races/sexualities/genders) should trivialize my fight.  We all have our own fights, and it's important to foster understanding and compassion regardless."

My mom accepted that I wanted to be masculine and that it was a thing right off the bat.   But honestly, it hurts me more inside to hear that I don't exist than that I should be [insert horrible acts of violence here]. My parents didn't (and possibly still don't) believe that who I love is even a thing and that was ""confused"" and ""going through a phase"". The things I hear about trans people are concrete threats. I can see them and so can other people. I have support through those. But the emotional consequences of erasure go unnoticed by others who aren't directly affected until I'm literally crying in front of them.   I know that anecdotal evidence =/= data but erasure is a very real, insidious, thing. Tell your boyfriend I think he's being a jackass for me :)"

A lot of my friends were a bit skeptical at first but easily accepted it. Not to mention - I personally am a FtM transman who also happens to be bisexual. I had to fight for my bisexuality and now I will need to fight for my gender. And yes both ARE fights. Fights for different reasons and of different ways, but one fight doesn't mean the other is invalid because one is harder or different."

Since he's Trans* he thinks that bi-erasure isn't a big deal in comparison to people literally killing transgender people after they come out. Which, obviously, it isn't. But it still is real and it hurts my feelings that he just brushes my identity away like that?"
bisexual,3c45ws,whompalicious,29,Sat Jul 4 18:10:48 2015 UTC,So basically his suffering means that you don't suffer in your own way? You need to tell him kindly that being bi has its own set of problems and that by denying them he is doing what others do to trans folk. I really recommend approaching this kindly and to make sure you validate his problems as well.
bisexual,3c45ws,laserlord,5,Sat Jul 4 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah. I'm not going to just yell at him because he's hurt my feelings. I wouldn't ever intentionally not approach a situation in a kind manner. I know he has problems, it's just really annoying because he's really negative about people and LGBT topics and I just don't know how to go about being like ""Hey, I don't have the same opinion as you please don't look at me differently"" You know?"
bisexual,3c45ws,namelessuser,12,Sat Jul 4 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"Why not start with that? If you cant communicate honestly you are allowing yourself to be bullied into silence, and that is the wrong relationship for you.   You NEED to figure out a method to speak your truth or just fucking leave. Simple as that. Otherwise youre enabling habits that will slowly destroy you.   So, sit him down and be like ""k you have strong opinions and thats cool. But I have strong opinions too and I need to be able to state them without you reacting negatively. Yes?""  Then explain that the very fact hes denying bisexuals have problems is a proof of bisexual erasure. Yes transexuals have it tough but this isnt a pissing contest. People can have it tough in Somalia without negating the suffering in North Korea. And both of those places have it way tougher than anyone in the western world so by his logic he cant complain either. Bring out your list of statistics about bisexual mental health, and a few self-declared bisexual celeberties that were declared gay by the media.   Then talk it out like adults."

We massaged each other lots and cuddled aswell. Well, after a bit I found I had a crush on him, and I couldn't keep it a secret. He was a bit surprised, told me he really really likes me and all but just didn't love me that way. It was though, but we ended up talking about it and sexuality in general and our whole lifes. We actually talked through the whole night. Talking about it helps so much.  We, or I, decided that we didn't want to stop our cuddling sessions and kept it going :)  I suggest taking at least an hour or two for you two, tell him and tell him about your fears and that you don't want him to feel strange about it. Just talk about it. It really helps.  You can't keep it a secret forever anyways if you two are that close. Better to tell him yourself in a controlled and calm environment."

bisexual,3c4baf,Allabear,3,Sat Jul 4 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"My other thought is: what if I'm not really bi? Like, what if I end up putting myself through all this trouble, when I'm really not 100% sure yet. How did you get to the point where you knew?  Also, is it normal for straight guys to do that sort of thing. Like, I guess what I'm trying to say is, do I have reasonable suspicion that he might be not entirely hetero also?"
bisexual,3c4baf,BiThrownFarAway,6,Sat Jul 4 20:26:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that there ever will come a time when you 'know', at some point you just have to trust. Sexuality is a spectrum, and bi is just a label to describe where you think you are on that spectrum right now. From what you describe, it sounds like it's a label that fits pretty accurately. Also, just because the thought of having sex with one guy turns you on, doesn't mean that all sexual experiences with guys will necessarily be positive ones.  As for the second part, I really have no idea what counts as 'normal', and it can vary by culture anyway, but I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that he could be completely straight. You won't know if he has interest in you, though, unless you ask."
bisexual,3c4baf,BiThrownFarAway,2,Sat Jul 4 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think I'd still have those doubts if I thought about it too much. Truth is, it doesn't matter what label you want to put on yourself. You love who you love and it doesn't matter what gender they are. Just be yourself.   And even if you don't want to tell him straight "" i am bi"", just say you are interested in woman and men but still have to figure things out to be sure. There's no pressure, you can talk to him just like with me. He will be accepting I'm sure."

I knew for sure when I was able to say it out loud and it didn't make me feel uncomfortable. I came out to a few random friends when I was 16, and hearing it out loud made me feel uncomfortable, so I never said anything after that until I was 27, when I finally felt comfortable saying it out loud. Like someone pointed out, maybe you don't have to put a label on it for now, you could just say that you're kinda interested in both men and women and that's that."

bisexual,3c1zqq,Zhuangzifreak,18,Sat Jul 4 00:48:23 2015 UTC,"I feel like Haskell's words were a bit misrepresented.  Delevingne said that if she ever were to fall in love with a man, then she would want to marry him and have children, but that she is scared to ever admit that because she sees it as crazy.  Haskell told her that she should just ""trust a man."" She was only saying that Delevingne shouldn't be afraid to share who she is with somebody she loves. She wasn't saying ""you can't do that with a woman"", she was responding to Cara's own comments on how she feels about her hetero relationships.  And when they even mention the word phase, they say that her parents believed it was a phase, and Haskell merely said that they might be right.  I know for a fact that there are people who at one point in their lives identified as bisexual, and then later began to identify as heterosexual. I've met some of them. They went through a sexually explorative phase, and then realized it wasn't really who they were.  The problem is that people are so unwilling to accept that ""phases"" are okay.  If somebody experimented with the same sex throughout college (or any other time- college is just a common time for this), then realized it wasn't for them, then they're straight. They're not bisexual just because they acted bisexually for a period of time.  To me, from this short snippet, it does seem that Cara is bisexual, but probably closer to heteroromantic than biromantic, because she directly addresses that she would one day like to settle down with a man.  It's not that she is worth any less if it's a phase. After her and Annie Clark split, she might never date a girl again, and start to identify as straight. And that would be fine.  But a sizeable portion of our community still gets so worked up whenever anybody mentions the word phase, as if somebody else's exploration somehow invalidates their own attraction."
bisexual,3c1zqq,student_of_bokonon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"I happen to know one of these people you mention, a bisexual who identifies as homosexual. No, it's not a phase, but we are so obsessed with labels and honesty that a lot of people feel a ""bisexual"" is innately a lie, because whether you are gay or straight is defined by your current or most recent romantic (or sexual) involvements.  So my friend publicly identifies as homosexual because he is currently in a mostly-monogamous relationship with another male, and he prefers men to women. I certainly don't fault him for how he chooses to represent himself, it's his choice if he wants to present as gay or bisexual, especially given that he likes women more as ""an idea,"" at least as he's put it to me.  But when the mainstream decides that it's meaningful to note that someone who identifies as bisexual has parents who think it's just a phase, ""and they may be right"" they are (intentionally or not) participating in erasure. So long as the person in question identifies as bisexual, it is nobody else's place to question if they are just in an experimental phase or anything of the sort.  I am bisexual, and I know the sting of people who say things like this, like the love I can have for a man is purely lust, or (paraphrasing as best I remember it): ""Well, it's normal to love men and women, but they're different sorts of love."" For as long as I still identify as bisexual, it is nobody's job to question if I am in a ""phase"" or ""period"" or ""mood"" about it, they need to just accept that right now, I am bisexual.  I may change how I identify at some point, but even then, I think it's up to me to decide how my time spent identifying as bisexual is labeled: Was I truly bisexual for these years of my life, or do I view it as just a ""phase"" I went through? I can't answer that until that change comes, and I don't think anybody else can either.  My complaint is not the idea that some people have phases of their life with different sexual and romantic attractions: Kinsey showed at least the bare basics of that to be true years ago. My objection to this article is trying to suggest that how she labels herself now is wrong just because she might label herself differently in the future.  Who knows, maybe she'll settle down with Annie Clark and just find a man to help her realize her dream of having babies, without ever finding a man she trusts enough to share the same love she has with Annie Clark. That won't make her a lesbian, though, unless she chooses to use that label for herself.  I just want to re-iterate one thing: I'm not saying there is no mis-representation here, but simply trying to explain that trying to label a ""phase in process"" is a form of erasure, as it suggests and implies an outcome that may not happen -- in this case, that Delevingne may change her label in the future from bisexual to straight, and that doing so would invalidate her current time spent identifying herself as bisexual."

I said that sometimes, it is a phase, but that we shouldn't treat phases as innately bad. I understand why you feel like the idea of ""phases"" is erasure, but I myself disagree. I think that people are meant to explore their sexuality, and if they at one point in their life they experience one type of attraction, but then later on no longer feel that attraction, it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing."

Another problem is that he actually identifies as straight..

Now this week he let me give him head for the first time, and while it felt weird for him he enjoyed it so much that we did it twice again the next day. Now he's gone though..

He knew I liked him, and he liked me back, but we lived in two different countries so it wouldn't work out.   He was my first (18m) and I can't get him out of mind. We'll probably never see each other again, cause we're moving to different countries for Uni, and knowing that kinda makes it worse.  So the day we finally kissed was amazing and I loved it. It was great because he liked me and I him and we were there and it was finally happening.   He was only here for a week on vacation and has now left, and I've been up crying a couple of times already. I really don't know why I cried so much. I mean, its def because I wasn't going to see him anymore, but there was something else, something more about it.   The way I see it as of now, and seeing this is still pretty fresh it might change, is im sad because I know for certain that if we'd only had more time or had met under different circumstances, we could of been great. And the thing that really gets me is, I think he knows that too.   but we can never talk about it. That'd just be weird. He's a good freind above all. One of my very few. So, we have to act friendly over fb or skype or whatever and not nostalgic and ""love-drunk"".   I think what im trying to say is; in my case, I cried because i felt like the universe conspired against us. That, had we only met earlier or lived closer, things would of been so much better. but instead, I'm just cursed with the knowledge that there could of been something amazing there... and that now, there never will be.   Perhaps maybe thats what you felt too... And if thats the case, you're not alone.   I'm sure it gets better eventually. I'll tell you about it if it does :P"

""well maybe its just a phase, I don't know"" still ashamed of that, I know its not a phase He was quiet for the rest of the car ride. About ten minutes we pull up into the driveway and I try to get out of the car as quick as I can but he sais.  ""I'm glad you told me. You didn't have to and I'm glad you did. I love guys in a friendly sort of way, like, I love Ron no matter how much he pisses me off, but I don't love him romantically. You're a good kid, a good young man, and your mom and I will always love you. I don't get it, and I don't know how to talk to you about it, but I'm gonna work on that.""

I didn't seek it out, but I didn't reject the idea, either.    I guess I never really thought anything of it because I didn't want to seek it out.

Now, I've got a few friends that are ""non-identifiers"", that is they don't identify as heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual they're 'just sexual'. A few weeks ago I was visiting them (a guy and girl) and long story short we ended up having a threesome. I'm really into the guy and he's really into her and she's really into me perfect love triangle. Anyway he ends up finishing in her and I couldn't wait to eat it out of her and lick it off his cock. It was ridiculously carnal and enjoyed every moment of it.  If theres something you want to do sexually go for it. Be upfront with the people you're with, but don't be ashamed or apprehensive about exploring your sexuality dude. We are all just human."

bisexual,3c0dv7,burgundy_snake,2,Fri Jul 3 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"People saying homophobia is bad but then saying ""ew gay"" or ""no homo"" or any of that is still homophobia, it's just coming from people that don't want to be labeled as homophobes.  They care more about seeming like a nice person and not a bigot than checking their actual homophobia.  You not wanting bisexuality to ""become a huge part of your identity"" seems to be coming more from your fear about their potential (inappropriate and immature) reactions than from a careful consideration of what is healthy for you.  I'm not saying you have to be in everyone's face about it, but wanting to downplay a part of yourself for potentially negative people is a reflection of how they're shitty, not anything wrong with you.  Unless you feel that you will be in physical danger, you should come out when you feel ready to.  When you do I am sure that it will become apparent to those around you that a man can be both bisexual and just another guy."
bisexual,3c0dv7,ConsideratelyYours,2,Fri Jul 3 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"So, I have a unique perspective in that I grew up with a homophobic family like the one you describe, but people immediately started cutting that bullshit out as soon as I came out to them.   It's almost as if their ""Ew, keep gays away from me!"" attitude was just an act that they were putting on because it was something that they thought was expected of them. That is: I don't think they legitimately believed what they were saying --- they were just following a script.  So, yes, perhaps they need a close friend/acquaintance to come out to them (or at the very least to tell them to grow up/cut it out i.e. because you found out a close relative is gay, for example) for them to kill that habit.   Hopefully maintaining your friendship is more important to them than maintaining their homophobic front."

It's another thing to bring it up at any possible time and never let people forget this aspect of you above everything else that makes you. If you're worried people will treat you differently, the people that do are not the people you want to be around anyway.   Edit: May I ask how old you are?

It's something you ought to do so much earlier in life, I think.  I have so many established relationships with so many people who think I'm straight that I have exact same anxiety when it comes to declaring myself bi.  Weird because I have gay friends and my parents are the most understanding people around. I keep it to myself for now, but in my head I made the commitment to tell if asked.  Nobody does, however."

""...No actually, and there's a special word for that brand of stupidity), he's fine with it and we're still the same as we always were.   I've also told women I've been involved with (though my rule is to do that AFTER we got involved cough) and very, very rarely gotten a negative response--sometimes quite the opposite, in fact. One girl reacted almost like she'd slept with a celebrity!  I think the casual homophobia that you mention kind of gets obliterated when people suddenly realize that a person they know and love as a friend is actually one of the ""other"" and not some stereotypical prancing queen they can giggle at.

bisexual,3c0gap,worcs,10,Fri Jul 3 17:17:08 2015 UTC,"Bi male Tinder user here.  I think, legitimately, guys are less picky, or at least guys are more comfortable as being seen as less picky. It fits into the social narrative of men being the ones who chase people and girls being the ones who want to find ""The One"" and settle down... Which doesn't translate to my own experience, in that if I choose my top five male and female friends, the guys I know are all pining over someone to date and the girls are all Imperator Furiosa'ing it down the Fury Road of drunk debauchery.   It's always difficult to posit whether society has dictated this stance, or whether natural differences between men and women has translated into this stereotype, but there's definitely a demographic skew with things like this."
bisexual,3c0gap,Saguine,2,Fri Jul 3 18:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm Bi, I am a guy, I sort-of use Tinder.   I 'play the game' in the sense that I do the whole 'swipe left swipe right get matches' thing but I never talk to anyone I match with. I use tinder more to 'see who's out there' I guess but I have no intention of going in for an attempt at a relationship or even a cheap hookup.  As for the rest of the question, yeah I think guys are less picky. In general. That's not always the case with everyone. I find I myself am less picky when it comes to other guys but with girls I am more certain about what I look for (I think it's because I'm more used to being all 'oh but guys are for friends girls are for relationships' BS that was drummed into me before I realized I was bi and societal norms are full of shit).  I also find I match with a lot more guys than I do girls on Tinder and with the guys it seems pretty random whereas the girls I match with are always the ones who I go for similar personality vibes from the description and similar likes, etc. Which leads me to believe it all depends on the types of people who you interact with, who use tinder, and for what purpose they use tinder."
bisexual,3c0gap,SirLlamaTheGrad,2,Fri Jul 3 21:35:10 2015 UTC,I think it's possibly that guys are just much more forward when it comes to casual sex. I'm a girl who's tried looking for casual sex on tinder with girls and it really doesn't go well.

Us dudes have a tendency to be more upfront about what we want (not saying the gals can't/aren't like this as well), thus with dating sites, there are more likely to be men on there than women. In my experience, during single's night at the local pub I tend to see more men there than women. They don't have ""free drinks for ladies"" night for no reason. Gotta attract the women folk.

You have a really long way to go before you are going to know exactly what you want and like and until you get to that point years from now, it doesn't matter what you call yourself as long as you are being safe and doing what makes you happy.   You might find you lose an attraction to one gender over the years or maybe you just want to date one and be intimate with the other. It really doesn't matter. Whether you are pansexual, bisexual, asexual, gay or whatever, just do whatever it is that makes you happy.   Dont spend your childhood worrying about what label to use. Labels are pointless things that people use to make other people feel bad. If you wanna kiss a boy, kiss a boy. if you wanna kiss a girl, kiss a girl. Maybe you won't like one, maybe you will like both. You don't have to figure it out just yet though.   Be happy, be safe, and enjoy your childhood. Good luck!"
bisexual,3bzo34,-atheos,5,Fri Jul 3 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"I concur! I first realised that I was bisexual when I was 13 too but it didn't really matter til I got older anyway. There was a chance I'd lose attraction to one gender and I did become more attracted to girls than guys at first. Eventually it evened out and now I'm split right in the middle. But that's just me, it's different for everyone! Keep it in mind but don't fuss too much over it. If you want to ask specific questions, go ahead and ask. If you want to research everything about bisexuality to understand it better, do that! Do what feels right for you."

Don't lose hope and wait for the self-identified bisexual redditors.  However, knowing Your age I want You to make sure You take care of yourself. Depending on where You live, high shool can be a place where people take something that is part of You and use it to tear You apart, bit by bit and screw you long term. Orientation is often part of that something and suicide rates on young people are critical during adolescence so not matter what You decide to do, consider your environment and your well-being first.  I'd say You could go without a label (without denying/suppressig your feelings) for now and give it time. You're just starting to ""build yourself"" so to say, transitioning from child to adult. Don't rush it and don't let anyone force any label on You, that is something You will have to decide on your own.  Good luck buddy."

bisexual,3bzo34,dallasdarling,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:29 2015 UTC,There is no deadline that you have to decide by.  And be careful using the word gender instead of sex. They do not always mean the same thing.
bisexual,3bzo34,mangocherry-tse,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"True, although I think attraction has more to do with the way someone presents than the gender they identify as internally.  Like, if a straight girl dates a guy who is actually a closeted trans woman, I wouldn't really consider her not straight because of that."

Which my dad was thoughtful enough to ask me about.  He asked whether he should be careful not to mention it to her until I say so, or if I cared (I told him I don't mind if he mentions it. Honestly means one less conversation that I have to instigate).  I love him :) In hindsight, I can't believe I was so terrified to tell him!"

Also, they are all extremely picky and shoot down lots of options for one reason or another.  I guess the advice I have is to get out of your comfort zone.  Also, be calm, don't feel like if you don't find a girl in a month you're a loser, it takes time.  Also, don't shy away from casual hookups with either gender.  I've had multi year relationships that started with a drunken lay."

Let them know of your interests, because everyone knows someone who knows someone.   And don't set your standards too high, everyone is a human being, and porn or Nicholas Sparks or whatever usually has us at a high expectation for relationships or sex. Ignore all that.   Again though, have fun with it, flirt with everyone, and make yourself happy.

You may be attracted to the fact your partner is bisexual. You may be attracted to many things and you can't be placed in a certain box. You don't know him enough to really know what to think.   What's great is you are young and have everything ahead of you- bi or not, sexual or not, have fun with your friend and don't place either of yourselves in a box, especially if you've never met in person! Speaking from experience as an insecure chick when I was younger - don't put yourself in ANY box... They tend to be rather stifling and REALLY boring! 😏"

bisexual,3bzdtu,cristalmighty,7,Fri Jul 3 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"No. I would disagree with that.   How come Ancient Greeks, for instance, were mostly bisexual?   Do you have a source for this?"
bisexual,3bzdtu,Feyle,5,Fri Jul 3 12:15:46 2015 UTC,"Not really, just what I've heard. Most Greek men would marry women, but also pursue relationships with other men outside of marriage. I just consider that weird, seeing as how, obviously, these days most people are only attracted to the opposite sex, or at least seemingly so.  As for me...the chances of me ever feeling attracted to another male are fractional at best."
bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,5,Fri Jul 3 12:18:41 2015 UTC,"It's not really comparable although you might have trouble seeing my point. In our time, we focus a lot the sex m/f of people in a relationship: opposite-sex = straight, same-sex = gay. But back then, they focused on who was dominant and who was submissive. If you were a guy and as long as you were dominant, the sex of your partner didn't really matter."
bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,4,Fri Jul 3 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what I've heard as well. But it still confuses me, because no amount of femininity on his part could ever convince me to fuck a dude."

bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,2,Fri Jul 3 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"Situational sexual behavior:       Situational sexual behavior is sexual behavior that is different from that which the person normally exhibits, due to a social environment that in some way permits, encourages, or compels the behavior. This can also include situations where a person's usual sexual behavior may not be possible, so rather than not engaging in sexual activity at all, they may engage in different sexual behaviors.  One example of situational sexual behavior includes when people might not have sex with prostitutes in their home countries, but may do so when they visit other countries, where such activities are legal or ignored by authorities. Another example is when individuals or members of a community might engage in homosexual behaviors but identify as heterosexual otherwise, such as some people in prison, the military, single sex boarding schools, or other sex-segregated communities.  Many people change their sexual behavior depending on the situation or at different points in their life.  For example, men and women in a university may engage in bisexual activities, but only in that environment. Experimentation of this sort is more common among adolescents (or just after), both male and female. Some colloquialisms for this trend include ""heteroflexible"",  ""BUG"" (Bisexual Until Graduation), or ""LUG"" (Lesbian Until Graduation).   A possibly common and transient example of situational sexuality is the person who, while self-identifying as heterosexual, will sexually interact with a member of the same sex (or a gay or lesbian self-identified person sexually interacting with a member of the opposite sex).

bisexual,3bzdtu,Feyle,2,Fri Jul 3 13:31:54 2015 UTC,"The point is that social setting affects people sexually. You're exclusively heterosexual here and now from the sounds of it but that mightn't be the case in ancient times.  I thinks as out own society gets more and more accepting of non-heterosexuality, actual bisexuality will become more and more common because people will care less and less."
bisexual,3bzdtu,agentfantabulous,2,Fri Jul 3 13:36:56 2015 UTC,"It's very possible, but I think that the fact that a majority of the population is wired to mate with the opposite sex is evident.

bisexual,3bzdtu,aoeui-dhtns,3,Fri Jul 3 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I might not be. Either way, bisexuality was condoned among Greek troops because the generals thought it increased the sense of unity."
bisexual,3bzdtu,aoeui-dhtns,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:21:38 2015 UTC,"Nope. An Athenian man who was penetrated anally was ineligible for citizenship or fighting. If he couldn't even protect his own ass, how could he be expected to protect Athens?  You're probably thinking of the the Sacred Band of Thebes, which was made up entirely of pederastic couples. In a pederastic relationship, there was not necessarily sex at all, and the accepted form of sex was intercrural, between the thighs. (Not that anal sex didn't occur, but if the boy's father found out about it and went public, there were really really nasty consequences for the man. The boy would be ineligible for citizenship.) Pederasty was a relationship built on mentorship more than sex.   Of course, all of this only applies to citizens, not foreigners and slaves.   The Greco-Roman view of sex was not ""two people do a thing together"", it was penetrator v. penetrated. Strong v. weak."
bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,2,Fri Jul 3 15:04:36 2015 UTC,"Still, it's weird to me that there was so much sexual fluidity back then. As I said in an earlier comment, for me, no matter how ""feminine"" the guy might be, I wouldn't be able to sleep with him, or any guy, ever. I've never found men attractive, and while I mainly hang out with dudes, I only ever notice the ladies...the reason I hang out with dudes is because I often end up daydreaming about kissing female friends.   I don't know. I know bi people who claim everyone is a little bi, and to be honest I strongly disagree. I do agree some ""straight"" people don't examine their sexualities, but I'm here to tell you actual monosexuals absolutely do exist."
bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,3,Fri Jul 3 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"I think most bisexuals would agree that monosexuality exists. It's why we use words like ""bisexual"" to describe ourselves.   The concept of sexual orientation itself is pretty modern. You can't really compare modern concepts of sexuality to Greco-Roman culture, because in those cultures, sex was not generally about mutual affection, it was often about power.   I do think that there are probably more people who experience occasional same-sex attraction than talk about it, but it's far from ""everyone""."
bisexual,3bzdtu,ArgyleMK,3,Fri Jul 3 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"I do think that there are probably more people who experience occasional same-sex attraction than talk about it, but it's far from ""everyone"".   Look in the Republican Party, haha. But in all seriousness, I agree with you."
bisexual,3bzdtu,djb_thirteen,4,Fri Jul 3 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it, it's probably a skewed normal distribution like this, where the left is ""more straight"" and the right is ""more gay"", and the height is the number (if you choose to look at bisexuality as somewhere in-between), since that matches other biological things- usually they're either a regular bell curve or a skewed normal distribution.  That is, most people are nearly 100% striaght, but not quite, and it tapers off from there. So yes, but to a very small degree, enough to tell whether someone is attractive or not but not much more."

Yeah, many straights have never examined their sexuality, but gays know they're not attracted to the opposite sex, and asexuals know they're not attracted to anybody.   You know bi erasure?

bisexual,3bxwdj,VenomousJackalope,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"Nope! I can't recall this ever happening to me as a child. By kindergarten I was already interested in boys (and curious about girls/women as well).  I had a ""boyfriend"" in kindergarten and second grade. In fourth-fifth grade I was obsessed with this one boy who just wasn't interested in girls yet, which I thought (then) that was totally weird and I even questioned if he might be gay. Of course now I know that was just my younger self being ignorant and drawing a conclusion out of disappointment that he didn't like me. I honestly thought that everyone had crushes on other kids. It was the norm for me, so I took it for the norm for everyone else. I have a distinct memory from when I was probably 4-5 of looking down a womans shirt out of what I suppose now was curiosity.  I think that I've always been really interested and curious about special relationships with others.  Although in highschool after a really bad breakup, I was convinced I was a lesbian. I just thought men were ""gross"". I just really was not attracted to the thought of being near a penis at all. I still can be that way, since I've never been in proximity of a naked penis, so it's just really foreign to me. I think that now, my ""ew, cooties"" phase is coming to light. Just out of my inexperience with cis-men in general. Not because I'm not attracted to them/want nothing to do with them."

bisexual,3bxy9d,ScorpionBite20,7,Fri Jul 3 06:00:00 2015 UTC,It really is that easy.
bisexual,3bxy9d,DILFchaser,2,Fri Jul 3 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience it's not that easy at all. That's a great way to make friends, not pursue lovers/romantic interests. We all have different experiences, obviously, but if you're in a space that's specifically geared toward this kind of thing (as okcupid is) you should just be forward. Ask a guy out on a date! Fortune favours the brave and you've got nothing to lose."
bisexual,3bxy9d,onahotelbed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I concur. I have no problem talking to the ladies, but I actually find it much easier to talk to guys. Just talk to them like you would to any guy you'd want to hang out with."
bisexual,3bxy9d,kinsey3,3,Fri Jul 3 07:57:47 2015 UTC,"Talk to them like a normal person. I mean it's how you make normal friends but drop some hints. I always ""jokingly non joke"" to test the waters. Also feel their opinion on bi, had a few gay guys just say ""nope, your not gay"". Well no shit, that's what bi means. Also true of the other side. Bi ""bigotry"" (more or less disbelief) will be your biggest obstacle once you get your introduction techniques down. I found lying works well...unless you get caught in a really bad way. Some girls have a mental breakdown when they find out, it's not pretty."
bisexual,3bxy9d,homfri,2,Fri Jul 3 18:33:00 2015 UTC,"First, you're not crazy.  Second, (and this might sound strange) I think queer men in North America tend to be a little shy in general. Even if a guy is interested, he might not show it. I'm not sure why, but it seems like there's a lot of fear of rejection out there. That has been my experience at least. I think that if you're interested in a guy, you should just ask him out. Treat the situation the same way you would with a woman.   This could also be part of the fact that you're inexperienced with dating in general. It's a set of skills and it does take practice. The way to learn is to do it."

bisexual,3bxy9d,Turisan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"I know how that goes, friend. You're not crazy, at least not for this. :P You pretty much described me, but I'm not on any dating sites. I considered myself straight until I encountered transgender pornography around age 14, and things sort of progressed from there. I've always been interested mainly in femininity, but then I find certain men make me weak in the knees. I saw Charlie Hunnam peel a white t-shirt off in SoA and my jaw dropped - I had to watch it over and over. As all my romantic and sexual experiences have been with women, I find I don't know where to start, either. It's terrifying and exciting at the same time."
bisexual,3bxy9d,sophus00,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:56:42 2015 UTC,"Wow.  The OP describes me very well.  I, too, have known for a while that I'm physically attracted to both men and women, but have only had M-F relationships (and even then, its only been 2).  Recently, I've had a growing urge to at least attempt a M-M relationship (to see if the attraction is more than just physical), but am having an extremely hard time making that transition.  (In my defense, I have an extremely hard time meeting girls, too.)    Keep in mind, I don't know what I'm talking about.  But, the easiest way for me to start a M-F relationship is to get to know the girl as a friend first (with no sexual tension adding more stress), and then start dating.  I imagine starting an M-M relationship the same way can be just as effective.  My problem is finding the guy in the first place."
bisexual,3by7e3,laserlord,8,Fri Jul 3 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"Attraction definitely feels different (while maintaining the same intensity) depending on gender for me too. I think it's totally reasonable to want to be dominant with one gender and submissive with the other, or to want different things from your sexual encounters depending on which gender you're dealing with. This doesn't sound like fetish at all, it sounds like normal attraction/sexuality stuff!  And I mean it's totally possible that you could be pansexual since you seem attracted to people outside the gender binary too, but it also seems like the gender of the person in question influences how you feel about them, sexually or romantically. Which sounds a lot more like bisexuality. I wouldn't stress too much about finding the exact label right away!"
bisexual,3by7e3,therealtwocones,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:19:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply it means allot to me. I'm not really all that stressed out about labeling myself but I don't want to appear to be unauthentic either if that makes sense.
bisexual,3by7e3,therealtwocones,2,Fri Jul 3 11:52:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm so glad! I definitely feel a lot of the same struggles that I think you are right now. I sometimes also have doubts about the nature/correct label of my sexuality, but we're totally allowed to let it evolve and to change the label if it no longer fits. I understand how important it can be to find the right word(s) to describe yourself."
bisexual,3by7e3,GPcouple07,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"First off fuck ""normal"". What is it really anyways? I think that if everyone was comfortable just being themselves and not so worried about being normal the world would be a better place."
bisexual,3by7e3,GPcouple07,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"I think that is true also, but the weight of society's standards affects us all in some way or another doesn't it?   I'm just trying to get the closest possible label I can before coming out to my family. Some of them are phobic, and my orientation doesn't really have anything to do with them, but I still want to do it because I shouldn't have to hide how I feel.  It's like I've had this secret my whole life, and I have felt ashamed of it. Seeing how normal it is has made me feel so much better about myself."
bisexual,3bx1gl,Iamaforeignconcept,9,Thu Jul 2 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"Don't sacrifice what you hold dear to make room for others, because you'll end up resenting them for it.  You're better off to take a stand early for what you want rather than give in and look selfish and bitchy later.  Also, don't worry about what some people say, because honestly, when you're on your deathbed, you're not going to give two fucks about them.

bisexual,3bx1gl,Unicorn_Tea_Party,4,Thu Jul 2 22:10:22 2015 UTC,"I'm really sorry you feel that way. I feel really scared about judgement too. I really want to explore the poly side of me, but I'm afraid of people thinking I have no morals, even though that's completely ridiculous. Have you checked out the bipoly subreddit? That might be helpful also."
bisexual,3bx1gl,whoopsidied,3,Thu Jul 2 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't, but I will.   I generally keep my love life private except to my partners because it's so socially unacceptable. And it is always the morals argument. People associate being poly with infidelity, I suppose? It's 100% not the same thing as cheating."
bisexual,3bx1gl,abyssinicum,5,Thu Jul 2 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"I just want you to know that you aren't alone. I've been with a guy for over 7 years, and we've opened up the relationship a boy so I can explore my bisexuality. But I don't know where or how to meet girls, so I'm lost in this new world.  Most of my relatives don't even know I'm in a relationship -- it's a huge deal for an Indian girl like me to date, let alone date a white boy -- so obviously they don't even know I'm bi or that I'm looking for a lady to date while I'm still in a relationship. As far as they're concerned, I'm a single straight girl. And most of my friends think I'm simply straight, and in a totally monogamous relationship. Only like five or six people know that I like girls.  I'd feel a lot better if I didn't have to hide everything about myself. But everything about me is frowned upon, even things that most other Americans take for granted (the fact that I've kissed a boy is a big fucking deal), so I'm kind of lost and alone.  You and I might have different journeys and different expectations, but I can relate to the feeling of being left out and unsure of where to go."

Good on you for doing it!"
bisexual,3bv1a1,Kokopod,2,Thu Jul 2 11:40:10 2015 UTC,"same. It's like a lot of relationships... The longer you wait, the harder it seems to bring up.   I also haven't brought it up because I was afraid it'd become the focus of treatment. I had an annoying interaction with a health clinic worker that implied my experimentation with the same sex had something to do with my mental health."
bisexual,3bv1a1,sane-ish,3,Thu Jul 2 15:19:48 2015 UTC,"As a bisexual who is working toward my MA in clinical mental health, I am so upset that a therapist you went to see made you feel as if such an important part of you is pathological. I am someone who works so hard to help clients who feel marginalized feel more confident in their skin. I hope you find someone else that can make you feel like you can open up to them."
bisexual,3bv1a1,kellinmurphy,2,Fri Jul 3 02:36:17 2015 UTC,"I should have been more specific. It was at an std clinic. I made a stupid risky decision and I was scared. She made a comment after going through my medical history that ""it makes sense that I'd have depression considering my sexual interests..."" or something to that effect.   No, my depression was not really related. I was nervous and uncomfortable because I had to divulge my entire sexual history and have a pin stuck down my ureththra. :/"
bisexual,3bv1a1,sane-ish,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:46:39 2015 UTC,That sounds like an awful experience to have to have. :/ you definitely made a brave choice in going to the clinic though as hard as it might have been.

Also, there's a market out there that exploits people's anxieties. I was quoted $500 for a private clinic before going to the FREE clinic. The worker there was honest enough to explain how long results would take, which gave me enough time to speak with a friend."

Same here, except my boyfriend and I just celebrated our 6-year anniversary (erhm, not that the length matters... just saying I'm in a similar situation so I can empathize). You're not alone! Welcome!"
bisexual,3by2v7,shitsgonewrong,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:23 2015 UTC,"I guess it is a question of overcoming your ingrained beliefs. Perhaps you were raised to believe that sex between same sex people was wrong. Just question these beliefs and realize that they come from an outside system and that you have internalized them and that you want to try something outside of them. There may still be a fear of judgement from others that you can address by not being public about your sex life. It may be weird at first but you may like it, don't let imposed moral structures rule your life."

bisexual,3bye2z,FormerLioness,8,Fri Jul 3 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"Honey, you need to let this one go.  Depending on what state you're in, you may not be of legal age to consent to sex at all, let alone to sex with someone at least six years older than you. A relationship with him, whether or not you're actually having sex, could potentially expose him to sex crime charges. Be safe and don't do it.  There is also a world of difference between a 22+ year old man, and a 16 year old teenager. Think about the differences in life experience, and what you would both want out of such a relationship. You are not on a level playing field here. That does not bode well for a healthy relationship.  For both of your sakes, let this one go. If you guys feel this way once you turn 18, that's your business, but for now, let it go."
bisexual,3bye2z,BiGuyWA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"Be patient, you have plenty of time and plenty of good people to meet. You're going to change a lot between now and when you're this guy's age, in some ways that will surprise you too. Everyone does.  I know it's hard to let someone go, but it's part of growing up. You'll come away from this more mature and with a better knowledge of yourself than before. Just be open to the lesson.  Good luck. I'm really happy for you that you are this young and so comfortable identifying as bi. When I was 16 I was trying to bury all my urges because I was scared of what would happen if people found out. Kudos buddy."

bisexual,3bw9jz,Steve_the_Scout,2,Thu Jul 2 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's something called sexual fluidity. Some people have it stronger than others. Basically, your sexual attraction just shifts around over time for apparently no reason, but usually it ""cycles"" (at least from what I can tell from my own experience and what I've heard from others). It sounds like he's still romantically attracted to you, but sexually neutral. If you give it time he'll probably start feeling more sexual attraction, and even he says he's got it on something of a cycle.  I wouldn't worry too much about losing him if I were you, but if you need some sort of sexual release, you may want to work something out with him, if you're up to it. It might be better for the relationship to do that instead of letting it build up and stress you (and him) out, but that's up for you two to decide."

Just go with what feels natural to you at the time.   I have days where all I want to do is blow a guy, and others where I'd rather sleep with a girl.   It doesn't make you any less of a gay/bi/straight what you like, as long as you're comfortable."

It took me a while to feel comfortable coming out to them as bi, but they were very accepting and I learned that many of them were also ""closet"" bi women in this lesbian-labeled group. Also if bars and dancing are your scene, be sure to check out your local gay lady nights. Also PM me if you want to chat. I'm in Southern Central Coast CA."
bisexual,3btt8p,clair3abelle,3,Thu Jul 2 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"I should do that, I haven't used my meet up app in a while. I think I'll be the same way. But I'm glad there's a lot of us out there! Well dancing is, drinking not so much hehe so I'll try that too. And I'll definitely PM you :)"
bisexual,3btt8p,femmefolly,2,Thu Jul 2 07:35:07 2015 UTC,Hi! New with being open/honest about my sexuality over here. What are these meetup groups/how can I find one in NYC???? My mind is blown.
bisexual,3btt8p,clair3abelle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:30:16 2015 UTC,Check out meetup.com to find local groups based on interest. LGBT is an overarching category but there are many different interests you can search out groups on. Luckily NYC is a great big diverse place so it looks like there's a lot to choose from on there!
bisexual,3btt8p,artichokess,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:21:17 2015 UTC,I for sure will be checking that out! It sounds awesome! Thank you!

bisexual,3btt8p,Kokopod,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"You can turn on the straight people filter, which will make your profile invisible to people who aren't queer."
bisexual,3btt8p,Kokopod,2,Fri Jul 3 15:37:53 2015 UTC,There's a social networking app for queer women called 'her'. Might be worth a look-in in case there are other Southern Californians on there?
bisexual,3btt8p,femmefolly,2,Thu Jul 2 11:43:33 2015 UTC,Oh my gosh thank you! I will totally check that out. Cause I think it'll be a lot better than Okcupid. Thank you again so much :)

bisexual,3bt2kd,Raven_Arabian,5,Wed Jul 1 22:35:11 2015 UTC,"I usually get 'dates' from places like Tinder or OkCupid, where you can declare your sexuality openly. I usually don't mention it much, unless it comes up or I feel a weird vibe from them, in which case I mention something LGBT to test the waters and go from there."

bisexual,3bt2kd,mad_queen,3,Thu Jul 2 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"Any bi coming-out, to a date or not, is often tricky--our sexuality is usually presumed straight or gay from the start, and finding ways to make it clear that we are neither without out of the blue saying ""I'm bisexual!"" is tougher than, say, the gay person who casually mentions their same-sex significant other to their coworker and has now fully leapt out of the closet. Sometimes the universe gifts you with the perfect lead-in, and sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, you have to create those opportunities for yourself, which can be hard, but not impossible, if you're committed. Being confident and casual, not as if you're about to drop a deal-breaking bombshell, is ideal (and if they do find it a deal-breaker, well, that's a deal-breaker). Such as: your date is going well, the evening is going long and you're starting to talk more honestly and openly. She asks you about your childhood and growing up; in the course of your description of your hometown culture and teenage angst, you can mention how high school was made tougher by realizing you were bi. (This is just a random example. My point is, if you can find places to work it in as information about yourself, that's great.)"
bisexual,3bt2kd,light_sky,3,Thu Jul 2 06:39:57 2015 UTC,"Im a guy and my thoughts are this. I tell anyone I intend to sleep with. Only fair for them to know, some people have freaked out so be prepared for that, but I told the woman I'm with now on the first date and she was fine with it."
bisexual,3bt2kd,Talamakara,3,Thu Jul 2 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"I came out to my now wife after we'd been dating for 3 months. Unless I met someone through a site that allowed that to be expressed, I probably wouldn't come out to someone unless I knew them for a while. I have friends that don't know, most do."
bisexual,3bt2kd,sophakinggood,3,Thu Jul 2 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a very straightforward person, so this approach definitely isn't for everyone.  When I was single I'd sometimes just say something like, ""So, there are some things about me that not everyone is cool with in a partner.  If you're not, that's fine, I'd just rather know now than waste either of our time.""  Not everyone likes this level of openness (but then that'd probably mean they're not for me anyway)."
bisexual,3bt2kd,Ildri4,2,Thu Jul 2 21:06:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I said to my girlfriend when we first started dating. I forget the actual context in which lead to the conversation, but it was exactly as straightforward as this."

bisexual,3bt2kd,MatticusVP,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"That's nice and a very considerate way to express one part of who you are with a potencial partner.

No one can make the social movement more than you"
bisexual,3bt2kd,ggreturnvoid,3,Sun Jul 5 05:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a woman, so my experience is likely different.  I never intentionally tell anyone. Maybe I'll mention having sex with a woman and explain it to those who look confused. Why do you feel the need to tell them?"
bisexual,3bt2kd,CopyRogueLeader,6,Wed Jul 1 23:51:17 2015 UTC,To weed out the bad ones. A surprising number of people have an issue with male bisexuality.

bisexual,3btyxu,entropoid,4,Thu Jul 2 03:29:14 2015 UTC,"Flirt with everyone you see that isn't taken or horribly unattractive for whatever reason like I do, duuuh. (Clearly an acceptable substitute for spouting about how bi one is.)  But really. Find someone who understands that you're gonna be maybe a little overbearing and overexcited and stick with them for most of it. At least, that's what happened for me. Some people were surprised, some people were... congratulatory (?) [""I didn't think you had the courage to be bi"" - whatever that means, though she meant well.], and some people were expectant [""I swear, I thougt you were totally gay when I first saw you! And then I heard from my bf that you had a history of 5 ex-gfs and was like ""whaaat, no way""""].  End of the day, as boring as it sounds, the ""novelty"" will probably wear off, but until then, enjoy it with someone who doesn't mind you being a little uppity sometimes.   Besides, there are some really, really hot people floating around. And some days I'm just like ""shakes self-identifies-as-probably-asexual friend LOOK. LOOK AT THEM"", even though they don't care and just laugh, look and humour me.  Tl;dr, it's normal, it'll probably go away somewhat, and you're human. Humans like sharing stories. Or maybe that's just me. I love talking so that's a thing."

bisexual,3btyxu,CurlyQ2,2,Thu Jul 2 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"I constantly think about it, instead of talking. I've found that being out to more people, though this may not be viable, relieves some of my desire to just spew everything about boys, girls, and my sexuality"
bisexual,3bs55z,rexuniversorum,3,Wed Jul 1 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, so I don't know what I can offer other than my empathy, and my appreciation of your situation.  I've never had serious homosexual contact but as I've been finally opening up to my homosexual feelings over the last couple years it's started to feel as if there is a psychological imperative to explore them, like it would be the key to unlocking various aspects of my personality which I've been grappling with my whole life.  I have the same guilt cycles; the thought of hurting my wife really bothers me.  She knows I now identify as bisexual but she is freaked out by it, because she says its a need she can never fulfill.  I still make a point of mentioning my progress in processing my bi feelings to her, because I feel like it's also not right to keep this whole aspect of myself hidden from the person I should be closest to.  I haven't outright asked about threesomes or swinging type situations, but I don't think she'd dig.  I am much kinkier than she is and my sex drive is much higher.  My game plan right now is just to continue being open, honest and respectful as possible and having faith that the situation will work itself out."
bisexual,3bs55z,pioughd80,2,Thu Jul 2 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I completely understand this. I have never been with anyone besides my boyfriend, and I don't plan on that ever changing. I just can't help but think what it would be like to date/have sex with another girl. I also feel really bad because my boyfriend is transgender, so I don't know what it's like to have sex with a cis-man, and I really wish I had that knowledge/experience.  I feel so badly about thinking these things because I do love him tremendously and would never want to hurt his feelings over this.  Edit: I also have thought about pursuing a polyamorous lifestyle, but i know he is completely against that. So I'm out of ideas to help get rid of these feelings."
bisexual,3bs55z,bifem221,2,Sat Jul 4 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"You could try to include her. A MMF threesome could be fun for everyone. She may get off on watching you with another guy.  You could also see if she'd be into pegging you. It's not quite the same as a real cock, but if you get the right dildo it can feel pretty real in your mouth, and someone else controlling the thrusting can hit all the right spots if you want anal. The role reversal may be fun for her too."

bisexual,3bs55z,MatticusVP,3,Thu Jul 2 02:01:43 2015 UTC,"It looks like the best thing you could do is approach your partner with your feelings and express your desire to explore your sexuality. This isnt something that works for all couples, but if approached properly can certainly help alleviate any resentment your feeling. Im a bi guy myself, and I let my girlfriend know when we started dating and then found out that she was as well. Early on we turned to the swinging lifestyle as a way for the both of us to continue fulfilling our desires together while still maintaining monogamous relationship. Its worked out well for us and has honestly been the best, most fulfilling relationship Ive ever had.   Your first step is to communicate your feelings to her, even if it never goes anywhere beyond that. Where you both take it after that is up to the two of you, but you'll never even get a start if you can't tell her how youre feeling."

bisexual,3bq9lj,Zhuangzifreak,30,Wed Jul 1 07:29:20 2015 UTC,I use it because it saves me time from going into an in-depth conversation with people who I don’t owe any explanations to.   That's the best explanation of why we use labels I've seen yet. It's quick and gets the idea across that labels can only scratch surfaces.
bisexual,3bq9lj,thatoneguy54,9,Wed Jul 1 12:23:15 2015 UTC,"Gosh yea.  I think most of us can agree with that, and it makes me real tired of  all the label bashing."
bisexual,3bq9lj,maleia,9,Wed Jul 1 14:11:05 2015 UTC,"Labels should be used to include people:   ""I know that Maria identifies as lesbian, but I heard she goes on dates with guys once in a while.  Maybe she's homoflexible, but she finds lesbian to be the closest fit for her.  That works for me, it's close enough.""   rather than to exclude people, eg:   ""Maria isn't a real lesbian.  She still goes on dates with guys sometimes!""   or:   ""Emily describes herself as a latina, but her skin is pretty light and she usually passes for white.  I'm not sure she understands our experiences, I would rather she didn't help to organize this group.""   Identity policing sucks.  Sometimes it's legitimately necessary, when it's clear that someone is abusing the system (eg. Rachel Doleza).  But often identity policing is harmful."
bisexual,3bq9lj,interiot,4,Wed Jul 1 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"But why would you identify as a lesbian if you're ""occasionally"" in to guys as well?"

bisexual,3bq9lj,CopyRogueLeader,2,Wed Jul 1 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to matter, I'm still interested."
bisexual,3bq9lj,Tuosma,3,Wed Jul 1 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"If someone is a Kinsey 5.9 (ie. 98% gay), they would probably identify as lesbian.  So where's the cutoff?  5.8?  5.5?  There isn't really a black-and-white cutoff."
bisexual,3bq9lj,interiot,2,Wed Jul 1 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"Do people actually take the kinsey scale seriously? If you'd define things based on that thing, then like 60% of people would be bi."
bisexual,3bq9lj,Tuosma,2,Thu Jul 2 00:27:12 2015 UTC,I think to some degree that is probably accurate.
bisexual,3bq9lj,stoopidemu,2,Thu Jul 2 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"Kenji Yoshino defines bisexual as Kinsey scale 2-4 or ""more than an incidental attraction to more than one gender.""  That being said, I agree with you."
bisexual,3bq9lj,stoopidemu,4,Thu Jul 2 01:36:46 2015 UTC,And generally label-bashing is only aimed at bisexuals/pansexuals/other non-monosexuals. Who tells gay people that they shouldn't use a label?

bisexual,3bq9lj,femmefolly,5,Wed Jul 1 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"I am bisexual and in a monogamish relationship.  Since I have never been happy, like truly happy before, my boyfriend assumes that if we break up, I'll end up with a man.  He takes care of me, I submit to him; we totally have a D/s thing going on.  And since I'm attracted to sweet girls he just knows I won't be happy with out a man.  I need someone to take charge, and I'm not generally attracted to take charge women so he concludes I need a man.    However, he isn't worried about me cheating, he's honestly trying to make sure I end up happy even if we break up. But it is so frustrating that he thinks I couldn't be happy with a woman, even if he is coming from a good place about it.   My sister has a girlfriend and she identifies as pan I think (not to get into labels, hah) and my boyfriend has this idea that she can't really be bisexual if she's never had a dick inside her. It's like. Dude! You are dating a bisexual woman, how can you still think that?   Of course my bisexuality is attractive to him; it's why he messaged me on the interwebs in the first place.  And so maybe some of this is going on with your boyfriend, he thinks because you are in this relationship with him, you need a man to be happy... Or that if you cheated with a girl it wouldn't be serious...  As to looking at other women, my guy and I will get hot and bothered over me looking at a girl, or is looking at the same girl.    I occasionally am attracted to men in the lusty kind of way, but it happens more with women, and he doesn't mind that either.  You can't help that feeling after all. He thinks it's hot because he knows who I am going home with.  But your guy might even think it's attractive when you look at girls. I don't think it's necessarily bad for him to be turned on by that and turned off by you checking out guys, but I agree with some other comments, this looks like it had the potential to become a bad situation, so I would watch it and BE HONEST with him. You can see how he responds to you and go from there.  Thanks for sharing."
bisexual,3bq9lj,loxxyhasmoxxy,5,Wed Jul 1 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"So much yes. I've (F) always gotten the, ""Don't go looking at men but you can mess around women as long as I get to watch WINK WINK ;)"" or most mildly, ""Men make me really jealous but women aren't a big deal, go have fun and tell me all the details later!"" I always felt like if a man I was dating was truly so ""unthreatened"" by the thought of me with a woman, then he must come to terms with the real possibility that I could fall in love with one and all of the non-monogamy that could come with that. So I'd always say, ""You're not really 'okay' with me 'acting on my attraction to women' unless you're also okay with me dating one while dating you."""
bisexual,3bq9lj,mattbluesman,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"So true! I struggled with this from both female and male partners... they considered any attraction I had to men or women (respectively) to be ""different"" than my feelings for them.  But the man I'm with now is different and totally accepting! I realized he understood my bisexuality when he made it clear that he considers the idea of me with another woman AS off-putting as the idea of me with a man. It's kind of a weird way of explaining it, but it's proven that he understands that my feelings for women could be as emotionally/physically deep as those for men."
bisexual,3bq9lj,artichokess,3,Wed Jul 1 16:22:22 2015 UTC,I'm pan and I really don't see an issue here I think she's looking into it too much. To me it wouldn't be the same if my wife had sex with a woman as it would be with a man. A man means she could get pregnant and I might not know if it was mine or not. With a woman there is no risk. Of course I'm for an open relationship though so that would explain some of my feelings I guess.
bisexual,3bq9lj,maleia,4,Wed Jul 1 16:28:46 2015 UTC,he is mainly concerned with her looking at other men or cheating with other men because he is a man. he can't compete with a woman because he isn't one - it's outside the game. just because she doesn't take gender into account when she compares her SO to other people doesn't mean that her SO doesn't take gender into account when comparing people to himself.
bisexual,3bq9lj,artichokess,14,Wed Jul 1 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"It is still him not recognizing that it would be cheating to her.  Because to her she can still have that relationship, that affair.

bisexual,3bq9lj,maleia,2,Wed Jul 1 14:14:04 2015 UTC,"It would be cheating as far as she's concerned but not as far as he's concerned. Just like one partner might consider it cheating if the other kisses someone, but the other doesn't"

bisexual,3brz4d,entropoid,6,Wed Jul 1 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"The idea that there's some threshold over which someone isn't truly bisexual is pretty much the most self-destructive thing in my life. Talking to others, I'm not the only one. I know a guy who literally turned down hookups because he felt the need to have precise gender alternation. What. The. Fuck.  But it's not his fault. Society is constantly questioning our sexuality. It's constantly telling us that if we don't police our own sexualities, someone else will.  Bullshit. Bisexuality is that you are attracted to more than one gender. Maybe not in the same way. Maybe not all the time.  We need more Kinsey 1/2 or 4/5 to publicly identify as bi in order to publicly call bullshit on this. The more people who identify as bi, the better.  Are you sincerely attracted to more than one gender? Great. You're in. Don't worry about not being bi enough. No-one should.  My only request (and it is request, not a demand) is that you be willing to advocate for your sexuality. Not all the time, but occasionally. ""Gay until graduation"" is only a problem because people aren't willing to advocate for it."
bisexual,3brz4d,djb_thirteen,4,Wed Jul 1 23:23:33 2015 UTC,"As for not feeling bi enough, I've been there too. I found this definition of bisexuality really helped me ease into being bi, when I realised my attraction to women was more than just a mostly-straight-but-sometimes-like-women thing: ""the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."" From what you've described you fit this definition of bisexual.  Another term (that I've actually never heard anyone use, apart from me) for attraction to more than one gender is polysexuality.   Technically, I could identify as polysexual as I'm attracted to genderqueer people. However I personally choose to identify as bisexual because being attracted to men and women dominates my sexuality. My understanding is that polysexuality as an identity, on the other hand, emphasises the fact that someone is attracted to people outside the traditional male/female dichotomy."
bisexual,3brz4d,Kokopod,2,Wed Jul 1 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"Polysexuality:       Polysexuality is the attraction to multiple genders and/or sexes. A polysexual person is one ""encompassing or characterized by many different kinds of sexuality.""  Authors Linda Garnets and Douglas Kimmel state that polysexual is a sexual identity ""used by people who recognize that the term bisexual reifies the gender dichotomy that underlies the distinction between heterosexuality and homosexuality, implying that bisexuality is nothing more than a hybrid combination of these gender and sexual dichotomies.""

It's okay to be you. As for your acquaintance, the worst thing he can do is tell people part of who you are. I'n feeling a lot of shame, too. That doesn't mean that you are identifying yourself improperly, it just means societal norms are burdening you. It's best to be open, but if you aren't ready, just be okay with yourself in the closet for a bit longer and work through your emotions. When the worst thing a person can say about you is that you are a unique individual with your own personal preferences, there is no power their. Maybe jealousy, maybe confusion, but certainly no power. This cloud hanging over your head, pardon the metaphor, really should be a rainbow."

bisexual,3bqcvn,entropoid,4,Wed Jul 1 09:05:23 2015 UTC,"It's funny how a person who comes from a group of people who claim that bisexuals ""reinforce the binary"", yet emphasize their desire that you conform to the binary by adhering to the gay end of the binary. Many mono-sexuals act as though they are authorities on the matter of orientation (gays and straights, alike). People who are going through shame imposed on them through culture have a hard time appreciating who they are enough without the added pressure of others acting like they ""know your sexual orientation better than you.    Your friend might have a point in that many 62% of gay men initially identify as bisexual initially, only to identify as gay later, and turn around and condemn bisexuality as if their experience is true of everyone. But it's interesting to note that 58% of men who men who may have identified as gay have changed their identification to bisexual.   Northwestern University did a study that proved bisexuality existed in men in 2011. Here's the link with interview with the researcher   http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/why-do-gay-people-hate-bisexuals-/51bb554c2b8c2a1bd8000110   Sexuality is dynamic and fluid, whether your friend gets it or not. Don't let him invalidate or dictate your sexuality.   I'm sorry you have such a close-minded friend.   If you ever need some relief from people's antiquated reasoning and evidence of how men (or anyone for that matter) can't be bisexual, I suggest that you check out the following podcasts on itunes that delve into the matter.

I'm accepted, in my opinion, because my (christian, homophobic) parents see me as half straight, and I have a bf. My friends and siblings are accepting. Being proud of my sexuality has helped me escape fear, but i understand some people are in a situation where they can't come out. It's okay. Just identify within yourself. Tell it to the mirror, whisper it under your breath, tell yourself that you're bisexual (if you are, if you think you are) If it feels right, then it is."
bisexual,3bmjd0,darqine13,11,Tue Jun 30 15:04:31 2015 UTC,This is just my opinion but I feel more accepted because i identify as heteromatic bisexual. So people see that I will date women and see me as more straight then gay. Which I don't really like but it what it is.
bisexual,3bmjd0,FluffyOreo,20,Tue Jun 30 16:03:33 2015 UTC,"This is why I am bisexual not just biologically, but politically. It's not enough to live a bi life under the table. More people need to stick their necks out and live it openly, and own it, and make it their thing. I'm fed up with the folks who play coy with labels. Same sex marriage is the law of the land. The gays got their say. Now it's our turn. Creating a social environment where bisexuality is seen with the same legitimacy as hetero and homosexuality, and where there is no more stigma for identifying as bi openly should be the 'next step' for us as a society.  There are many people who live in pain and fear, who limit themselves and wish they didn't have to. There are kids who commit suicide because they're coming to terms with their sexuality, and they're getting bullied, and when they seek counciling their councilor says their sexuality isn't real. We should be angry about that and we should fight to stop that."

bisexual,3bmjd0,thejoker4059,13,Tue Jun 30 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"The harsh reality according to me- It's hard to think that either side will really ever accept us (on average). It's hard to imagine monosexuals ever not feeling at least somewhat threatened by us. It seems like the only area that gives is female bisexuals with straight men. From my standpoint (male), I can't imagine, on average, straight women or gay males ever fully accepting it tbh. The thing is, I get it and might even feel the same way if in their shoes. We appear to threaten the mono way of life, even if that wouldn't happen in reality. If a given person can find another mono, then why take on the extra risk we present (in theory). So while I think discussion is helpful amongst us bisexuals, I don't believe there is some mystery to be solved through greater exposure that will make monosexuals think oh, now I get it. I think that's selling the monosexuals short; they get it, they just try to mitigate the theoretical risks we bring to the table, even if it is just in theory. I think the only thing we can do, as a group, is show potential SOs that we aren't a risk on an individual level. Ok depressing and pessimistic outlook ends here."

Now they're awesome people and I love them but they just don't get it. That's why we need a bisexual community, because we get it and understand you don't have to choose. Of course you can of you want, that's the beauty of bisexuality, but it's not compulsory."
bisexual,3bmjd0,Internetimal,2,Tue Jun 30 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"Well, hey, SSM seemed like a long shot, too.  Substitute 'gay' for 'bi' and 'straight' for 'mono' into much of everything you said and .. visibility apparently worked, as a long game.  The exception, and I'm seeing this over in the trans community too, is mistaking 'getting a date' for 'acceptance.'  I don't exactly want to minimize that but I'd love to be living in a world where that was the only concern."
bisexual,3bmjd0,thejoker4059,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:28:49 2015 UTC,Good point. Regarding substituting gay for bi and monosexual with straight-First point- straight people are included with monosexual. Second- A distinction might be that gay and straight folks don't mingle together (relationships or sexually) like bi folks do with both the gay and straight population.

If bisexuality as a movement gained more traction, it's likely a whole lot more gay sex would start happening. We're talking kinsey sized amounts. If just the exclusive gays do it, and they stay in their corner, it doesn't affect straight homophobes much but with bisexuality... watch out! It represents a much greater challenge to the status quo and to relationship dynamics and gender roles."

When people already think that almost a third of the population is up for it, yet self-reporting is maybe around 2-3% LGB and [very roughly] 10% tried-something-but-don't-identify-as.. then it probably only has the chance to become as prevalent as people already think it is.  Weird, huh?  That said I don't have a problem thinking there are biological underpinnings to a lot of this - straight, gay, bi, fluid, surprised midway through life with a flip, the whole lot - in the weird and complicated way that biology actually works.  After all, all evolution has favored the whole time is ending up with enough individuals who are inclined to reproduce and carry on the species (and even those only have to be hetero-inclined enough)."

Its very hard to explain to someone who isn't bisexual what your sexuality is, or what your definition of sexuality means to you. But I've found some helpful videos about erasure and identification of bisexuality by a woman who identifies as bisexual.

bisexual,3bmjd0,MissSwissy,3,Tue Jun 30 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of amazing things about being bi, and all the bad things are heaped on us by society--bi erasure, biphobia, etc. Those bad things, especially the erasure, form a feedback loop: society says bisexuality isn't real, and points to the fact that there's no bisexual community (in the way that there is a gay community) to prove it; concurrently, a lot of bisexuals don't come out or identify publicly as such because it seems like bisexuality isn't real and there's no one to validate them, and there's no bisexual community to step out into the way there is for gay people. But the truth is, there are actually more bisexuals than gay people out there! We could and should have a community and culture just as vibrant as gay culture--it's the societal erasure and biphobia that keeps us from getting there. Battling these ingrained attitudes can feel like trying to swim against a strong current, but hey, look at how amazingly far the gay rights movement has come, and the number 1 reason for their progress was people coming out. I have faith that as we come out and identify ourselves as bisexuals we'll turn that negative feedback loop into a positive one--more out bisexuals = more community, less erasure/biphobia = more people happy to come out as bi."
bisexual,3bmjd0,Beautifulgenotype,2,Tue Jun 30 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"As somebody who identifies as bi, but also on the asexual spectrum, the emphasis on bisexuality being about ""who can get us off"" makes me a little uncomfortable honestly... I think it's better to say ""the genders we're attracted to"". Plus it kinda makes bisexuality seem like it's all about sex, which is one of the reasons people use to discredit bisexuality.  Anyway, I dont disagree with your reasoning - I think you pretty much summed up the reason bi people often feel more comfortable within bi communities vs any other communities :)"
bisexual,3bpk5z,clair3abelle,4,Wed Jul 1 03:04:08 2015 UTC,I should add (I'm on mobile and can't figure out how to edit my post) that a big thing I worry about is other people seeing my how my coworker does- as a straight girl who likes sometimes making out with other girls.

bisexual,3bn8ji,gwynfshae,11,Tue Jun 30 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"Well, there are 318.9 million people in the US.  1.8% of that population would be 5.74 million.   And then consider that is simply the number of people who currently identify as bisexual. It doesnt account for those that are curious or questioning, or identify as pansexual. Add the 5.42 million that identify as gay and we get 11.16 million.  Still think we're really so few?"
bisexual,3bn8ji,MatticusVP,18,Tue Jun 30 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"Not to mention a lot of us aren't exactly open with our bisexuality, which skews numbers even further.  Take me for instance. I made an alt account just so I can talk openly about my sexuality, something I'm not willing to do irl or even with my main reddit username (that is tied to my irl identity that my family and work can see).  If I was surveyed, I'd probably answer ""straight"" if the survey was done in person or over the phone. Only in the last few weeks/months have I accepted I'm bi, so even online/anonymously I would've put ""straight"" until recently.  Edit: Also, this is my first comment. Hello everyone!"
bisexual,3bn8ji,abyssinicum,2,Tue Jun 30 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a tiny number. Just because there are millions doesn't mean that in context it's that many. My life experience, while anecdotal, completely disagrees with the assertions in the article. I realize that it is subjective, but question their methods if they came to such a small number."
bisexual,3bn8ji,rotabagge,3,Tue Jun 30 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"Most polls do find higher numbers (around 3-4% iirc), but demographics has a lot to do with it. LGBT identity is strongly associated with age; the rates are radically different between those under 30 and those over 50. Also, I believe in excess of 10% of Americans have had same-sex experiences."
bisexual,3bn8ji,Antaeus663,8,Wed Jul 1 00:07:56 2015 UTC,"If you google : 'homophobic aroused by gay porn' you will find that there are many studies that show that homophobic men are more commonly correlated with becoming physically aroused with gay porn (man to man). My favorite studies that I remember was done in 1996  1996 and published in The Journal of Abnormal Psychology. In the study non-homophobic men and homophobic men had there sexual arousal levels measured by devices that measured engorgement and found that of the two groups 80% of homophobic men and 30% of non-homophobic men did register physical arousal by man to man porn despite their denial.   The list of similar studies and findings go on and on. Again: just google the topic.   What I'm getting at is that there are a lot more people who are sexually fluid that either are conscious of it, or rail against it through homophobia in order to cover for themselves not being straight.   Out bisexuals, like us, are just the few that acknowledge our true sexuality. Most would prefer to live in denial, in the closet, or simply keep hoping their sexuality will go away from anything other than what is considered straight.   A big problem that contributes to this is that there is a lack of education about the spectrum of sexuality, and people think in terms of fixed gay/straight binaries.   The fact that anything other than straight is so discouraged, and the is a lack of education is that people fall into a panic like ""I'm Not Gay!!!"" and try like hell to be and appear straight despite the reality of their sexuality.     Anyway, If you look at all the significant statistical results that show that homophobes and non-homophobes (80% and 30% in this instance) and you consider just how many people you run into who are homophobic, you start to wonder just how many people are on the spectrum between the two extremes that are just fighting it or unaware of it as opposed to embracing it, like ourselves. It would have to be a lot more than 1.8% of the population, I would imagine. They just don't verbally admit to any of it."
bisexual,3bn8ji,BananasAboutYou,5,Tue Jun 30 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that's fascinating! It seems many of the really outspoken homophobes have major gay scandals, I wonder how many aren't actually gay but bi"
bisexual,3bn8ji,Antaeus663,2,Tue Jun 30 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I honestly think a lot of people who say being gay is a choice must actually be bi, and they have that opinion because they personally have felt some measure of attraction to people of the same gender but been able to ignore it and say, nope, I'm just going for the opposite gender. But while that's understandable when you first start to realize it, you can't do that forever without some serious cognitive dissonance, or a complete lack of self awareness."
bisexual,3bn8ji,Antaeus663,3,Wed Jul 1 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"Also, because anything other than being straight is seen as disgusting by SO many people, there are a lot of people who lie in the middle of the continuum, they feel a lot of shame, and that causes a lot of people to fight their same sex attractions through reaction formation, and lash out of those who remind them of what they hate about themselves. If the stigma were dropped, and more people were educated and comfortable with the sexual continuum we could live in a much more enlightened era and a lot of the homo/bi-phobia would be eliminated.   Unfortunately, people tend to fall on the ""gay or straight"" point of view and see there bisexual nature as a battle to be fought in themselves (and others) not be gay,  as opposed to accepting their sexuality for what it is."
bisexual,3bn8ji,Antaeus663,2,Wed Jul 1 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think that there is a definite possibility that they are bisexual (or gay) and are just fighting their same sex attractions. A lot of these really religious types, view those attractions as a temptation that they are fighting off.   Again, the conception that people are either straight or gay keeps people identifying as straight rather than bisexual because of stigma. This stigma affects men more.   There are stats that show that only 12% of bisexual men are open about it, while 70% of gay men are out. I don't know   how that would change up the overall percentage rates for bisexuals, but I would expect them to be a lot higher if 100% were out. This just takes those who acknowledge their bisexuality.   When considering how many straight homophobic  men, and non-homophobic men show physical arousal to man to man porn, yet deny any kind of arousal, I think it would be staggering how many people you would be able to classify as bisexual.   There were many cultures that practiced commonplace bisexuality before the spread of Christianity, including: Ancient Greece, Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, South American. There was more bisexuality practiced in the United States, prior to the depression-era, and the moral conservative 50-60's period.   I could give the sources, but if you just google any of this stuff, the information is there.   I think that there are A LOT more people on the spectrum between straight and gay, who are so influenced by cultural influence and stigma that they are left corralled into mono-sexual labels."
bisexual,3bn8ji,Antaeus663,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:07:01 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that Catholic Church's pro-gay standing for centuries, etc...  I don't necessarily think that arousal is 100% accurate to determine sexuality, since in high school guys might be walking boners but they're not necessarily aroused by lockers and books. But I definitely think the numbers are much higher if you take into account the unsure and the in denial."

Personally I think it's likely that there are a lot more bisexuals than 1.8 %. Most of them think they're straight their whole lives, never questioning, never realizing. When I think about my life... change one or two things at an early age and I might not have ever realized or come out, and I'm pretty damn bisexual. And I was always a super progressive, open-minded fellow. I'm sure a more conservative person with my genes would've never considered they were anything other than straight."

bisexual,3boklp,awoldotz,2,Tue Jun 30 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not qualified to offer any comments regarding gender questioning, since it's something I've never experienced myself, but I have often had the nagging feeling that I'm not ""really"" bisexual.  No matter how many times I look at men and women and say, ""yes, I am attracted to both"", or how much I know that I'd be willing to try a relationship with both, those strange doubts show up.  I think what's going on in my head is something like this:  First 30 years of my life: Everyone tells me I'm straight, so I assume that I'm straight, and assume that how I feel is how a straight person feels.  Therefore, how a bi person feels MUST be different than what I feel.  I finally accept that I'm bi...and I still feel just like I did before because I've always been bi...but my brain still thinks that how a bi person feels is different from how I feel...and therefore my brain says I can't be bi.  It's a totally illogical loop, but there it is.  Confusion and doubt is normal.  The fact remains that no matter what our confused brains tell us, the definition of being bi is being attracted to both: if you meet that definition, you can identify as bi.  You're not an impostor!  If you haven't already crossposted to one of the transgender or genderqueer forums, you might try there.  They might have some encouraging words as well."

I was raised religious, so I was convinced I was straight for a long time -- anytime I would be attracted to a woman (I'm a cis woman), I would be convinced that it was just because ""women are sexy to everyone"" and made other doublethink type excuses. It took a while for me to come out to myself, to accept that this is not something I'm thinking myself into... I'm still in my process of acceptance and pride, slowly working on coming out to people, but I have a lot of shame I still haven't completely worked through. What I've learned through all this is that I'm truest to myself when I stop thinking and just feel out my desires. I would say try not to figure out a label right now, and let yourself explore and understand your gender/sexuality orientation, and then, when you feel sure, you can pick whatever identity rings true for you. And, you can always change your mind if you realize your identity doesn't feel right anymore. Don't put to much weight on words or labels just yet. Hope this helps :)"

bisexual,3bnjpm,TheDammitCat,6,Tue Jun 30 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation a couple of years ago, only I dreaded telling my mom more than my dad. My dad and I are so much alike personality-wise, it's not even funny. Even though I knew he was fairly conservative, and it might take him some time to adjust, I knew he'd be okay with me.  Mom, on the other hand, has always been terribly concerned about keeping up appearances and having the approval of everyone. I knew that her main concern around all of it wouldn't be ""is my son happy?"" but ""what will the neighbors think?""  I told them when I went to visit them for Christmas one year. I'd planned on doing it several times before, but always lost my nerve, so before I got to their place, I texted my dad and basically said ""Just so you know, I need to talk with you and Mom about some things while I'm down. Nothing bad, just some kinda big news.""  My dad actually asked me about it over breakfast the next morning (he and I are both morning people, so it was just the two of us). I told him, he was super-supportive (it turned out he'd suspected for years), we hugged, then he asked if I still wanted to go deer hunting after the holidays. No big deal at all.  I brought it up to my mom later that day, and it went just about as bad as I expected, if not worse. At the end of the day, though, she knew, and I was able to move forward.   What helped me more than anything was understanding the reason why I was telling her. It wasn't so I could get her to approve of me or accept my ""lifestyle,"" it was so I could give her the opportunity to do so. Whether she actually does or not is entirely on her, but she's unable to at all if she doesn't know.  I know that's a long damn post, but I hope it helps. One other thing to consider: let a friend or two know that you're going to tell your dad before you do. In the event that it goes badly, it really helps to have someone awesome to vent to. :)"

bisexual,3bnjpm,biguy86,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:22 2015 UTC,Have you spoken to your mum about this again? I'd start by being really open with her and explaining your fears. The thing I've learnt is that people (especially men) have a public persona and a private persona we only expose to our SO. In the case of macho men a lot of their opinions are bravado and possibly not a true reflection. Explain to your mum that he scoffed when you said you were going to Pride and ask her whether he truly feels that way or whether she thinks he is going to be accepting.   I personally think you should rip the band-aid and then see where the cards fall and go from there. If I was your dad and I learnt this via your brother (or one of his friends) I'd be hurt and it wouldn't be the best platform to start communicating with him from. The best way to make him understand is to hear it in your own words from you. Have your mum there if you think that will help calm him?
bisexual,3bnjpm,TuskenCam,2,Tue Jun 30 19:46:22 2015 UTC,My mom and I have spoken extensively about it. She knows it's not easy but honestly doesn't know how he's going to react.

bisexual,3bnjpm,schrodingerorgsm,2,Tue Jun 30 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe I can offer a different perspective for a moment. I'm socially uber-liberal, but read a mix of conservative and liberal news cause I'm kind of a libertarian. The interesting thing I've noticed just by ducking all over is that theres a not-so-subtle difference in how pride is covered between the left and right. Now I've never been to pride myself, but I have a couple friends who go pretty regularly. But even if the articles themselves cover pride in a neutral or positive light, the right wing media sources often choose the least palatable pictures for their coverage, while the left chooses extremely positive pictures.  Its a subtle dehumanization tactic used to make pridegoers look like extreme weirdos. Its possible he may have been influenced subconsciously to view pride as a freak show when its not. The reason I say this is that, while I am not out to my family, I am out to my closest friends. Some of them are diehard conservatives and against gay marriage(even still), but they accepted me with open arms. Its absurd I know, but often people will view ""the gays"" as a different group, while viewing friends and family who happen to be gay or bi as ""my friend/brother, who also happens to be gay/bi"". I can't offer much certainty, but I can say people will sometimes surprise you how they can say one thing and act differently.  Ask yourself if you believe your father is a good person. Does he go out of his way to help people, or is he kind of a dick. If the former, his beliefs will follow his conscience. If the latter, his beliefs will be whatever benefits him most. It sounds from your post that he is the former.  Either way, I wish you luck. That sounds so scary. :/"

Everyone in a long relationship in some point feel bored of your sexual  but in a bisexual mind the attraction of a gender different than your partner must be more difficult..."
bisexual,3bp8tj,entropoid,2,Wed Jul 1 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"I've been married for 25 years and the closest I got to ""bored"" was in the first year.  I'm comfortable and happy with it.  Admitting to my bisexuality has not changed that, except that now I don't get all furtive about thinking Matt Damon is hotter than the sun.  I don't see why being bi makes monogamy any harder or easier.  It's not like it's all about the number of people in the world you could conceivably be sleeping with."

bisexual,3bkqru,stillhere1,3,Tue Jun 30 10:53:13 2015 UTC,"Congrat! I know how it feels to be open and honest with people about it. I am in your bucket, too, since I have one family member who knows and three friends who know. Most people wouldn't guess it since I am married and that makes them automatically assume straight. I feel bad that I let them assume that and watch what I say to not change their minds on it. My problem is they are mostly acquaintances or work friends so they are easy to run off or cause work issues. I really do wish I could know what it is like to just be open with everyone or at least not feel you are hiding it.  It is all stuff that I am continually learning as I go along. Things change in life that at times make it harder and sometimes easier. THe hardest was able to be comfortable with it in college and then jumping into a corporate position that was absolute straightsville.   My mother suspects but is afraid to ask. She is convinced that bisexuals are the most dangerous thing on the planet, trying to sleep with everyone, all the time. I just want to scream that just because I CAN be attracted to guys or girls doesn't mean that I am attracted to ALL of them! I am pretty sure she feels I argue with her too much about those kinds of issues to not have some kind of stake in the game.  :)  Keep on your path, good luck with always finding the right direction and to keep going forward!

bisexual,3bm7vk,rolyatetak,5,Tue Jun 30 10:19:12 2015 UTC,"Ugh this always annoys me when I see girls feeling that being into something makes them not a feminist.  Let me lay my biases out here. I'm a male bisexual submissive into bdsm, who dislikes modern feminism but considers himself an egalitarian and takes consent very seriously. Just throwing this out here because I feel like I should let you see my biases before I make some statements.  The whole point of feminism done correctly is not about always being powerful or empowered. Its about giving people the freedom to choose who they want to be. Moreover, what someone does in the bedroom does not reflect on their character in the rest of their life(unless they violate consent). I'm constantly seeing posts ij various places online by feminists who feel guilty about being into types of sexuality that might be considered degrading or demeaning. But you know what? You don't have to answer to anyone for anything.  Its a sort of a weird slut shaming you see from some groups where being sexually submissive is viewed as a sign of weakness. Its not. A healthy relationship is based on mutual respect, trust, and EQUALITY. Its not demeaning if you approach as equals, then one chooses to lower them self, because the important point is the submissve is choosing. They are making the choice as an individual. I can think of few things more powerful than being able to choose your way of expressing your sexuality with someone you care for.  I realize this is only addressing one part of your post, but its something I feel strongly about and relate to. Regardless, whatever you're into, no matter how ""degrading"" or ""wrong"", it is perfectly fine as long as all parties can consent and are of clear mind."
bisexual,3bm7vk,schrodingerorgsm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"that was really the least of my problems in this point, not to mention i addressed my reconciliation of that, and i know that sexual preferences do not equal feminism. i am very aware of consent and i am very loud about consent being important, both in my public life and my sex life. trust that i don't feel guilty about what i am into that maybe is not considered ""feminist"" only that i'm trying to work through being into things not considered ""feminist"" with only one of the multiple genders i'm into, which is strange territory on many counts. i've always been in healthy relationships where i have trust in my partners and i've been an equal. i have always chosen the things i am into, no matter how they are viewed by society, and while those views sometimes make me wonder some things, i have never been coerced into doing them on behalf of someone else's pleasure. i do not, and will never, need to be lectured about that, i promise you.  frankly i don't need men telling me how to feminist. i've been a feminist longer than i've identified as bisexual. and maybe i should have just left that part out so that i didn't have to deal with this. because the main issue of my problem is dealing with different kinds of attraction to different genders. and yes, one part of that is reconciling that one of those attractions is ostensibly ""more feminist"" than another, but that i will get over. it's the sorting out of multiple genders at once that i need the most help with which i thought i emphasized."
bisexual,3bm7vk,schrodingerorgsm,3,Tue Jun 30 19:42:14 2015 UTC,"i don't need men telling me how to feminist   Men can be feminists too...  Anyways, multiple types of attraction happen. I know its confusing as all fuck, believe me. Unfortunately, in my own soul searching I found very little on differing attractions between genders. The only thing I found was ""yeah that exists"". Ultimately, you need to accept that you're who you are, and different levels and types or attraction are actually fairly normal, believe it or not. Many just opt to focus on one gender, while others just take whoever they meet who is ""the one"" first, and then stay monogamous and loyal. Some go for swinging, polyamory, hookups, threesomes. My point is you have options, and you can find support here, but defining and answering your question is something only you can do.  And in the future, may I suggest proofreading your posts and taking a slightly less hostile tone? Its kind of hard to follow and I do want to help since this is supposed to be a safe space, but people are more likely to respond to a better written post."
bisexual,3bm7vk,schrodingerorgsm,4,Tue Jun 30 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, and a the term I've seen thrown around here for sexual taste shifts is the ""bi-cycle"", which refers to a tendency for people to prefer one gender sometimes, and another other times. It comes and goes like a tide shifting one way or the other. And even still the tendency for certain types of attraction being specific to one gender is totally normal.  I'll use myself for a simple example. I don't like submitting to men. I like pleasing people of either gender, but for me true submission can only be with a women. I don't judge other ways of approaching sexuality, but for me personally, I cannot go that way. But I can dominate either gender without problems. Weird, right? Anywho, just try not to stress too much."

I've had a hard time weighing being angry and not tolerating bigotry vs. aiming for a calm, kind example.  These issues are always there, of course, but the ruling brought it all to the forefront.  On the other hand, seeing the outpouring of support on facebook and the internet at large was amazing.

I had a close family friend text me about how this is the fall of western civilization and how this government is becoming godless (it is supposed to be, dangit!). After a few exchanges, it wasn't pretty. We are now avoiding each other.  I heavily censor myself on Facebook, though I did do the flag thing. I just felt like if it bothered anyone enough to unfriend me then I really don't need their kind of toxicity anyway. I have been trying my best to not antagonize anyone. I'm 39 and fairly recently realized that I need to care what I think more than what everyone else thinks. Easier to do at 39 than when I was younger but, still, the fear of discussing same sex marriage, my bisexuality, etc, with anyone freaks me out because I don't want to find out they might be close minded assholes. I know the gay marriage decision will come up when my mother visits this weekend. I'm dreading it because I don't want to just sit there and let her spout off about it but I don't want to get too in her face and cause problems.  I just fear her asking ""Why are you so vocal about supporting it?"" and, without thinking, respond ""Because I am Bi, Mother!"" Not the best way to come out.  ;)  It is a slow journey forward with people but every once in a while there is a leap forward like the SCOTUS decision. I just keep faith that as the generations progress, tolerance will be winning over close mindedness."

bisexual,3bl3sw,Stjem05,11,Tue Jun 30 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"Totally normal. Bisexuals are attracted to both sexes--not necessarily in the same way, not necessarily one over the other, and not necessarily to the same degree."
bisexual,3bl3sw,sonalis1092,5,Tue Jun 30 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"Let me introduce you to a concept that greatly helped me when I was struggling to identify:   There are two types of orientations, sexual and romantic.  Sexual orientation is ""a person's sexual identity in relation to the gender to which they are attracted"", meaning people you find physically appealing. Romantic orientation is defined as ""an individual's pattern of romantic attraction based on a person's gender"", which is seen as the capacity for love.  This means you can be sexually attracted to both men and women, but only be romantically attracted to men, and vice versa, or really any combination. Personally, I (male) identify both sexually and romantically attracted to men and women. You can also be asexual, but have romantic feelings for males, females, nonbinaries, trans folk, and what have you. Sexual and romantic orientation are two completely different things, and while they can both be influenced somewhat by each other, on the whole they are independent of each other.   It is perfectly normal to have feelings leaning towards one gender on one orientation, but have stronger feelings regarding the other gender on the other orientation.    However, I cannot tell you how you feel. You must take a breath. Go treat yourself for the next few days and do some self reflection. It's fine not knowing right now how you feel. Hell, it took me years to figure out what I am and my feelings.   Don't panic. Smile. Self reflect. Have a good day, and message me if you want someone to talk to!"
bisexual,3bl3sw,justbeyourself,3,Tue Jun 30 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"I am bisexual but it is very fluid. I am primarily attracted sexually and romantically to women but seem to go through cycles where my attraction to guys ramps up for a while and then eventually goes back to where it was before. My attraction to guys is mostly sexual but I am open to the idea of being romantically involved with one because I have had romantic feelings in the past for guys though it is rare for me. Typically, the urge is physical, not emotional. Sorting through those feelings over the years was difficult because I felt bad only being sexually attracted to guys. Was I a bad person because I wanted to sleep with them but not date them? I had to understand that I can't control who I am attracted to but I can make sure I am honest to anyone that I might be physical with and make sure I have boundaries that I am aware of and follow.   Attraction isn't a zero sum game. Attraction to one thing does not lessen attraction to another. My attraction to guys goes up and down but I am never not attracted to women. My feelings about guys has never affected my relationship with my wife for that reason. I've been lucky enough to get to explore my feelings about guys sexually on my own(a long while ago at this point) as well as explore that with my wife involved. It helps that I've been open with my wife about all this since back when we first were dating in high school. I am 39 now."

bisexual,3bj5d5,TheQuietudeAbides,12,Mon Jun 29 21:45:47 2015 UTC,"Something like this?  1.8% of the population is bisexual, making us the largest sexual orientation group other than straight."
bisexual,3bj5d5,djb_thirteen,5,Tue Jun 30 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"These numbers still strike me as far too low. The study only counted people who were considered adults in 2011, and I would bet that in the past 4 years, the social acceptability of being LGBT has only grown, and that there are a lot of people who were teenagers in 2011 who would be considered adults now (and also people who are only teenagers now) who identify as bisexual. I would bet that a survey done today would show a higher percentage than 1.8, even if it used exactly the same methods. I'd do it myself if I had the resources."
bisexual,3bj5d5,TheQuietudeAbides,6,Tue Jun 30 13:25:30 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly.  It's really very difficult to survey sexual orientation. Because it's so private, people are rarely willing to just say. That requires researchers to use a variety of tricks to get accurate data from people.  Indeed, what's striking about the Gates research is how variable the LGBT population was in different surveys, but the ration of gay:bi was fairly stable. That indicates that once you've gotten people to open up, they're quite honest about their orientation, provided you have a base level of methodological rigour for allowing people to identify other than gay or straight.  It's rarely the focus of a study, so researchers are unwilling to invest high levels of time and effort into getting accurate data on sexual orientation.  As a result, there's few studies that specify sexual orientation, and so when it comes to metastudies, like Gates, they usually have to use very historic data."

bisexual,3bivok,dumpaterfamilias,3,Mon Jun 29 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, that's tough. Personal story: like you and many other bis, my sexuality is often fluid, but even when it would skew far one way or the other, I always had at least a little attraction the other way, too. Then one time a few years ago (after being bisexual since my earliest consciousness), my attraction to girls (I'm female) completely vanished. Thinking about being with girls was actually repulsive to me. It was something completely different that I'd never experienced before: not just a diminished attraction, but an anti-attraction. It completely freaked me out. Was this what it was like to be monosexual?! I wanted nothing to do with it. I was really anxious and upset that I had suddenly, inexplicably, lost my identity. But after a month, I gradually started being attracted to girls again, and things evened out. I have no idea what happened, and it's never happened before or since. So, to sum up, even if you're experiencing a skew one way to a degree you never have before, at least in my experience, for what it's worth, you still may return to the middle with a little time. I really hope it works out for you!"
bisexual,3bivok,light_sky,2,Tue Jun 30 07:11:13 2015 UTC,"If it was a one-off thing, it could have been as simple as a mild bacterial/viral infection causing inflammation in a part of your brain - let's say the insular cortex. (Some forms of encephalitis can do this). A month later, you fought it off, and you're back to your regularly scheduled programming.   Or a migraine (not the traditional kind, but a migraine nonetheless). Heck, it could have been some food you had a bad reaction to.  Scary, but ultimately, sometimes shit happens."
bisexual,3bivok,dalekcutaway,2,Fri Jul 3 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"I [F] have experienced such fluctuations before and waited them out.  I'll admit I've never had to deal with long-term out-and-out repulsion, though. Consider how much you want to save the relationship. Whatever you're thinking, you owe her honesty once you've come to a stable conclusion."
bisexual,3bivok,too-much-sass,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're just seeing an unexplored side of yourself, that's how I discovered my sexuality, and I feel about the same as you, another bi friend of mine said you could have attraction swings, but it does not really affect commitment. Some days I'm in a 'female' mood and some days i'm in a 'male' mood, but I still like both."
bisexual,3bivok,Erzherzog007,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're just experiencing the natural lull in lust that happens as every relationship matures, and because you already have a muted relationship with a woman, it's putting pressure on your gay side to come out. If you were in a long term relationship with a guy, it's could be that it would work in the same way - just in the opposite direction.   Your sexuality can be fluid. It can be affected by your emotional state, if you're depressed, and just by nutrition and brain chemistry. (I speak from experience; all of these cab shift my sexuality one way or another - as can alcohol and boredom). (I'm not saying everyone is like this).  My wife is bi, I'm bi, we're naturally a little combative with each other, but it's tempered by love, lust and chemistry. We figured out a way a while back to keep it all in check and stable - and that's by a few times a year, we'll play with other people together. Male, female, whatever. It resets our attraction for each other back to lust, and gives some variety.   It might not work for you, but it works for us and as a result we're now in a decade-old relationship and have a kid together. We've got an escape valve we can both demand to use, and it means we stay together, which is worth it because we love the crap out of each other even if occasionally we drive each other nuts."

She told him you are whoring around on Halloween in your photos on Facebook and...  that you said you like guys and girls"" I looked at my girl like SHIT. Rushed home. My dad eventually confronted me that day about the photos. But he didn't say a word about liking guys and girls.   Instead he said, ""and what are you even doing in college????? What in the HELL do you think you're doing?"" He looked disgusted. I've never EVER seen my dad look at me like that. Like I was filth. And I looked at him dead in the eye, I've never been close to my father so even staring him down was the scariest thing I've done in my life, and I said, ""I am being myself. I don't care was Granny Cooper thinks.""   He just stared. He dad said, ""I'm her son. I care what she thinks."" I just said,""Goodnight, dad.""

bisexual,3bfgrr,homfri,8,Mon Jun 29 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"The aggression, hate, and vitriol on my Facebook feed has been unbelievable. All sorts of people, from friends to friends of friends to acquaintances, were just coming out of the woodworks to post and repost things in opposition to gay marriage. I am not out perse - some friends know because I've talked about my crushes on females and males. It was surreal that all these people had an issue with my sexual orientation, and they didn't even realize I was one of the people they were targeting. I even had a friend talk to me about gay marriage and the Bible, and how she still felt it was her Christianly duty to speak out against gay marriage. She kept framing it in a 'us vs. them' mentality. She had no idea that I was one of the 'them'."

That's why I decided to just do a big reveal, because it was kind of like a big slap in the face to all of the people on my feed who were spreading the hate; to show them that they were also targeting their own loved one without knowing it.

One of my other brothers changed his profile pic to that Red Cross overlay that is supposed to represent being opposed to gay marriage about an hour ago, so there's that.   The way I see it is, I'll learn who I don't need in my life, and who's still cool to keep around. I've had enough arguments about gay rights with my family before I even knew that I liked women as well. I'm fully prepared to separate with anyone who can't respect me enough to treat me like everyone else. It's tough, but my own family taught me to be a prideful person."

I'm a very private person, so while I fantasize about making out with/screwing other girls a lot, I don't know if I'd be comfortable doing anything without an emotional connection.   I'm still figuring out what to do. For now, I'm looking for how I can meet girls who like girls, and who can actually find me attractive. I'm near SF so it shouldn't be hard, but I have a horrible gaydar and low self-esteem, so I don't expect this to be a quick thing.  I feel at times like I need a mentor to help me through this process since I'm so inexperienced. Maybe you'll find someone better than I to give you advice."
bisexual,3bjsd3,falcontent,5,Mon Jun 29 20:14:03 2015 UTC,"Wow your friend saying things like you're the 'token straight friend' & 'you wouldn't understand because you're straight' is pretty unhelpful regardless of your sexuality. Is there someone else close to you that you could come out to first? I'm guessing your friend will be supportive once they get that you're serious, but is there someone else that will outright support/believe you from the get-go?  She might not question whether you're bisexual or not if she's got someone else telling her/if there's someone else there to back you up?"
bisexual,3bjsd3,aqueniaz,3,Mon Jun 29 21:31:57 2015 UTC,"That's true, she probably would take it seriously if I had back-up. I hadn't thought of that so thank you for the idea!   My family is pretty narrow-minded, so I can't tell any of them right now. My other best friend, who is straight, would probably believe me right away because I've told her just about everything and she's taken it all in stride (including my ADHD & seasonal affective disorder). But we were basically inseparable in college, like where ever I went, she went and vice versa so our friends used to joke we were ""gay for each other"" (which wasn't cool; I had a lot of shitty friends in college) and she was really uncomfortable about the whole situation for a long time. So I'm not sure if telling her will change the way she looks back on that time. I didn't know I was bi then, but still, I don't want to make her uncomfortable. I've been dropping hints to her, too, but she hasn't picked up on any of them :/"
bisexual,3bjo86,bicuriousthrowaway88,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"First time advice giving here. Sounds like you are at least partially bi because you're attracted to dicks. Some people call that hetroflexible, which works too I guess since you're not into the whole package, so to speak."
bisexual,3bjo86,Cpnths,2,Mon Jun 29 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"Omg this actually describes me so well. I have a lot of fantasies about being dominated by guys all the time, but I'm not really effeminate, just quiet and also had a real asshole and physically abusive dad.  I see guys and girls I feel something about, but it's hard for me to picture myself with a real guy 'cus I'd feel really embarassed just being a total sex slave to somebody, yet it's what I alwyas dream about, even sometimes whn I'm watching hetero porn I just imagine I'm the girl ><. It's easier for me to get along with guys too, and I get close to thm more readily, but something about it still bothers me, only I'm too scared to pass hi with most girls regardless, and I'm nto sure if I feel the same amount of zest I do if I'm with a really attractive guy. I think I just think they look hot and the rest of the respons is all anxiety :s"
bisexual,3bjo86,rodarolla,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:04:00 2015 UTC,When I'm not actually in a situation where I can or am trying to get with a girl I get along rather well.  At work I often find myself talking  to girls in the office but not guys as much. It's really strange.  Some dudes I get along with great but not many.

bisexual,3bgkxk,VegHeaded,8,Mon Jun 29 02:31:38 2015 UTC,Awesome but like wolfy said it's mostly to celebrate that same sex marriage is allowed everywhere in the US which is why my FB has gone all rainbow and I don't even live in the US.
bisexual,3bgkxk,Dr_appleman,6,Mon Jun 29 11:16:22 2015 UTC,"I thought it was to celebrate pride weekend and it just happened to coinside with the US decision? Given the app is called ""celebrate pride"" and last weekend was known coming for a long long time for someone to design the app for it (although not complicated seems more like someone would need more than a day to plan it..)"

bisexual,3bgkxk,Dr_appleman,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:17:30 2015 UTC,There are multiple pride weekends throughout the US and the world. This was to celebrate the SCOTUS decision.
bisexual,3bgkxk,kaichai,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly does it really matter if it celebrates one, the other or both? it's a great way just to show support on social media in my opinion, but the fact it happened to coincide with pride weekend in the US and the UK (where I live) and other places in the world, and was called ""celebrate pride"" made me think it had a wider scope... and is largely what my feed seems to suggest because honestly, while it's great the US did it, it's taken them long enough and they are way, way behind other countries despite being ""the land of the free"", but w/e it's great to see my facebook turn into a literal rainbow of support"

bisexual,3bgkxk,mjigs,5,Mon Jun 29 01:34:32 2015 UTC,It's more about the fact that two people of the same gender can get married now and putting it on your profile shows your support for that.  Not really about being gay/bi/straight/whatever.   Still cool though.

I think there's that overlap of lesbian/bi girls who don't want to be somebody's ""experiment"". I think that denotes two different things- experiment says N.S.A. type thing and relationship is something that could be more serious/committed"

The roles are clearly defined in a male/female dating situation - this is new territory for me. I met this girl on tinder and sever been talking for about a week. I was totally honest about what i want and my lack of experience, so that helps take some of the pressure off. Tinder felt easier for me, because you don't have to put a label on your sexuality thr way you do with sites like okcupid. It's all anonymous until you both select each other. You might try a site like that first. Good luck!"

bisexual,3bfray,femmefolly,12,Sun Jun 28 21:49:31 2015 UTC,I was pleasantly surprised to experience absolutely no negativity whatsoever about being bi while I was at Pride. There were also a few people in the parade today holding signs that talked about ending the bi stigma and hate. I cheered at that. :)
bisexual,3bfray,brutalistprince,14,Sun Jun 28 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"Hate to play devil's advocate, but I attended pride for the first time this year in Houston, and there was a lot of negativity towards bisexuals going on. Even on one of the big stages, there was a trans-woman speaking and she called someone up randomly out of the audience and asked ""Do you like boys or girls?"" and the girl replied ""I like a little bit of both"", the woman speaking proceeded to call her a 'greedy bitch' in front of over hundreds of people. I was kind of appalled, I had heard lots of stories like yours about prides trying to end the stigma and whatnot beforehand, so it was a major disappointment for me."
bisexual,3bfray,DustyToad,3,Mon Jun 29 01:15:55 2015 UTC,Was it more in a joking way or actually just berating her in front of everyone? It's hard to believe it's the latter.

bisexual,3biayn,MatticusVP,2,Mon Jun 29 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"HI, fellow queer lady here. I have had almost exactly the same experience. Before I realised I was bisexual, I thought that all women who were attracted to men (like me) were also attracted to women (like me). I thought that all straight people felt this way and only the lesbians felt it so strongly that they acted on it. I had never acted on it, so I assumed I must be straight. LOL NOPE. Anyways, this realisation happened right before I entered a relationship with a super understanding (male) SO. Even though I'm probably more attracted to women than I am to men, I never really had the chance to act on those desires because I was falling madly in love with him! I've been super open with him about my queerness and he's really been great about being receptive to hearing about my sexuality. At first, I think it was a big self-esteem issue for him. I don't blame his reasoning: If I'm attracted to both men and women, then how is it possible for all of my identity to be satisfied? There were a lot of ways we talked about it and here's where we are, after 10 months of being in a very serious relationship.   I am in this relationship because I am choosing to be. I am not in this relationship because I think I need to be. Each day I wake up and choose to be with him - not any other person, male or female. We've discussed doing a threesome at some point - he says that he'd be down. He's excited that I could be able to explore that part of my sexuality in a physical, intimate way. However, he has said that he would feel uncomfortable if my experiences with women went beyond the purely physical threesomes. He feels (and I agree) that it could quickly turn into a polyamorous relationship that neither of us really want.  I honestly think it's important to be able to describe to him what it's like to be attracted to a woman, in your words. Chances are, he'll find a lot of similarities with what he feels when he is attracted to a woman. This works particularly well when describing women you can both see at the same time. If you're both out in public together, it might help to (inconspicuously) point an attractive woman out to him and say something along the lines of 'Wow, /u/bisexualgirlhelpme is really attractive, I can't help but notice her!' If he affirms, it's really great to follow up with, 'Would you end this relationship right now if you could have (consensual, of course) sex with her? Me neither. That's how I feel about women too, just like you.""   Being bisexual is nothing to panic about! It doesn't make you any less of a girlfriend or any less faithful to have sexual desires for women. I have them myself! It's taken some time where now my SO and I can watch movies together and both openly be like, ""Damn, Emma Stone looked so hot in that scene,"" and then enjoy our common ground of lady appreciation. PM if you need anything or want to talk! I can ask my SO if you have any questions for him too about his experience. Good luck!"
bisexual,3bidoy,Raeginglamb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:14 2015 UTC,can they select multiple choices for sexual orientation? they should be able to
bisexual,3bidoy,doombybbr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"This article is pretty wildly outdated. You can now choose queer as well as a host of others and you can select more than one. Besides which the whole article seems to be based on the presumption that there aren't any real women who identify as bi. And then we drag out the whole ""bi implies gender binary"" trope and then somehow gender binary is related to couples looking for a threesome. The article's kind of a mess in my opinion."

I am 30 years old and my parents never accepted or embraced my bisexuality.  While my husband is understanding and embracing of it, and his mom is generally okay with it, his dad is pretty homophobic.  One thing I have learned (just this year, unfortunately) is that I shouldn't waste too much time trying to ""change"" parental figures' minds.  It is exhausting and hurtful, and it stops me from really embracing myself and who I am.  If they cannot accept me, that is their problem, not my problem.  So, I totally sympathize with feeling sad, heartbroken, upset, and/or unseen in this type of a situation.  But unfortunately I think some people are just either ignorant or disrespectful (or both) and they don't see how damaging their actions and words are...so the best you can do is protect and love yourself.

This weekend I wrote about my experiences so far because I thought it was about time I wrote down how I am today to how things were.  My mum reads this, no word from her as yet this could be down to a number of things   She could of got to the warning and stopped reading Read it and stuck her head in the sand and yell 'la la la my son's totally straight' Not read it yet   But I feel totally awesome for writing it, more out in the open than ever.

I think with time she will understand it more and be openly accepting.  Especially with more education.  On a high note!  Half my family is Mormon, one Mormon cousin in particular took on the rest of her family to defend equal rights.   It was very touching and meant so much to me.

Coming out to myself and my husband was enough at that point, because I have no intention of renegotiating my marriage.  I have come out to my employer since then, but that's it.  Even that much has alleviated a lot of stress - I finally understood my nagging sense of duality ( the outer Me vs. the inner Me). It literally lifted the minute the penny finally dropped."

I've had only casual experiences with women, never a true relationship, and I feel like I may always be curious about what it would be like to maintain a serious relationship with another woman.  It's like something I almost feel obligated to do as a proud bi girl? (Though I know that is NOT true; I'm just as bi no matter what my male - female dating ratio is).  This is still a possibility someday of course but I feel almost certain that I'm going to end up wanting to marry the man I'm with now (he's wonderful :) ).

And I suppose a unicorn is different than just a girl who is bisexual, it's a certain kind of person. I've always been the type to experiment, and married at 26 is not what I saw for my future at all. I was happy to be single and ready to mingle till I got old, but you can't really control who you fall in love with or when.. It's not that I want to service people, I would do it for me.

We've talked about opening our relationship to allow me to date women but I think he's having a hard time with possible jealousy/insecurities related to me dating a woman so we are putting that on hold for awhile. Though, I am disappointed. If I was single, I'd love to be part of a triad, whether joining an existing diad (dyad?) Or coming together as one.

bisexual,3bgjdx,FluffyOreo,3,Mon Jun 29 00:59:58 2015 UTC,"Being nervous is fine. Here's my breakdown of what you need to do.    Know that this may or will be tough for them. Just because they support gay marriage doesn't mean that they'll be totally positive right up front. Have somewhere else to sleep that night, just in case. Do not bribe them. Don't feed them a big meal and then tell them or buy them gifts then tell them. Just tell them. Find an environment where you are not facing them, but you are all in a circular shape: i.e., not opposite sides of a counter, but around a table or chairs in a room. Keep it direct. Do not beat around the bush. Be kind, but not air-headed. ""Parent, Parent: I love you both and respect you both and want to tell you the truth: that I am bisexual"". After that moment, let the reaction settle in, then ask what they need. ""Are you okay? Do you need something? Do you need space to talk it out?"" Feel free to remove yourself at any point, and to tell them it's okay if they don't want to react to it right now, or if they need some time away.    Regardless of what happens, you are entitled to know this: You should feel safe. If you do not, leave or call for help. Once you tell them, it is not about you anymore. Their process with this deserves just as much respect and time as you had for yourself. You should feel loved, you should also know that reactions other than ""We love you Big HUGS!"" do not mean that things are going bad.    Maintain eye contact and a kind face.

bisexual,3bh2jr,Mattpilf,2,Mon Jun 29 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"This is how my girlfriend as I got together. I was dating guys casually. She was in a steady long-distance relationship with a guy for over 3 years. I needed a roommate and she decided to move in.   She outright told me that she had been attracted to me since highschool, and told me that her boyfriend also thought I was hot and they wanted a threesome.   I had never seriously considered dating/fucking girls. And while I didn't want a threesome, the thought of making out with her was appealing. The guy I was seeing at the time didn't mind, and her boyfriend was encouraging it (probably still with the idea of having a threesome eventually).   In the end, he got super jealous, and the subsequent fights ended their relationship. A few months later we started officially dating.   So depending how you look at my experience, it's either a super great idea or a really horrible one. We are definitely happier than we were in our previous relationships, but I'm not sure the guys that were involved are happy about how it turned out."
bisexual,3bhcda,daesie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:50:19 2015 UTC,"Congratulations:)  Okay, on the boyfriend thing: Don't think for a minute that this will completely alter your relationship with him. You still love him, he still loves you, and sharing this newly discovered piece of information about yourself will only serve to let the two of become closer. Love is about acceptance. Its about knowing someone completely and being so fascinated and infatuated that you're prepared to spend forever just knowing each other and sharing every moment. Its not like you're telling him that you're leaving him for someone of a different gender."

bisexual,3bdwph,Idodrunkthings,6,Sun Jun 28 13:23:08 2015 UTC,"The challenge is, firing people for 'no reason' is something that exists as part of 'right to work' legislation throughout the South. Even if we get that protection, firing people for 'no reason' will become the goto.  OTOH, if the employer has a history of homophobic statements, a lawyer can fight the 'no reason' firing. Expensive to fight though."
bisexual,3bdwph,james4765,4,Sun Jun 28 17:43:35 2015 UTC,But we can get protections like ra ial minorities or religious people.
bisexual,3bdwph,fishytaquitos,6,Sun Jun 28 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I'm no lawyer, but I believe the way the ruling was worded, referencing the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, these practices can no longer be considered legal under the Constitution of the United States.  Yes, they will have to be challenged in court in states with large numbers of bigoted officials, but equality under the law should be a no-brainer moving forward."
bisexual,3bdwph,Daddio914,4,Sun Jun 28 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that's not correct (because even though the ruling would make sense if you cross-applied it to other instances of LGBT discrimination it was specific to marriage, and also I don't think the law works like that) though I'm also not a lawyer and wish it was."
bisexual,3bdwph,9bitz,4,Sun Jun 28 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"No, the ruling does not work like that. The opinion specifically limited the argument to marriage and the 14th Amendment. There was no discussion of heightened scrutiny, which would have indicated that LGBT people are a protected class and therefore any discrimination against us would have to be looked at from a heightened level. Would have been nice, but Kennedy has always shied away from that when writing opinions about queer people. He had the perfect opportunity to do that in Lawrence v. Texas and didn't. :( So we have to do this the hard way, in the state legislatures and Congress."
bisexual,3bgbhn,bakersam,5,Sun Jun 28 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're having a rough time of it!  To be completely honest, if you're in the states for studies, can I suggest checking out if your school has counseling/mental health services of any sort that you'd feel comfortable with? While I totally encourage you to explore your sexuality, it sounds like you're carrying around a lot of unresolved baggage from your childhood. Take care of yourself! You deserve it! In my opinion, sexual relationships tend to magnify feelings: if you're feeling positive, they make life better, but if you're suffering, they can drag you down and make things worse.  (btw, plenty of women like lean, southeast asian men, so don't worry about that!)"

My campus does have a counseling center which I have used before to deal with other issues of my life (bullying experiences, loss of a family member, and sexuality but without mentioning what I have mentioned here) but they are closed for this summer.

bisexual,3bcdbt,drop2377,114,Sat Jun 27 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"I feel this really hard. I get insecure when Pride rolls around because of how many times I've heard gay folks say that if I'm (f) in a relationship with a man then I'm ""essentially straight."" So... I smother myself in bi pride gear and don't bring my partner. I wish I could be badass enough to not use those coping mechanisms but that's just where I'm at right now in my life.  But there are also things I remind myself very often: yes, I'm the B. I'm the B because I'm attracted to more than one gender; my relationships and sexual experiences don't change that. The organizer of the first Pride rally, Brenda Howard, was bisexual and partnered to a man. As evident by our health disparities and violence against us, bi people are part of the struggle. We deserve Pride because we're marginalized, because the spirit of Pride is to be visible and unashamed. Shutting out the B and the T is an insult to those who started a movement of liberation without hierarchies."
bisexual,3bcdbt,xotacoxo,13,Sat Jun 27 22:17:30 2015 UTC,I used to be that way. Then someone told me that sexual preference does not necessarily dictate sexual conduct.
bisexual,3bcdbt,Tolfasn,4,Sun Jun 28 05:05:37 2015 UTC,I'm a little unsure if I'm getting the message right. I've read the other way of this already and gfet it. But is this statement mean like bi people doesn't have to fuck & date a guy and a girl at the same time?
bisexual,3bcdbt,WatHppnsRddtStysRddt,2,Sun Jun 28 08:36:07 2015 UTC,"What I get from it, is just because you are attracted to members of the same gender, doesn't mean you have to be in a relationship with someone of the same gender. It also doesn't mean you have to be equally attracted to both genders."
bisexual,3bcdbt,Tolfasn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"I also thought about that, but then being bi in dictionary, it doesn't say the level of attraction and in general public or at least bi/lgbt community, we know it's not equal. So sexual conduct also. But yeah, aren't you just stating the definition of being bi and agreeing that sexual preference dictate sexual conduct?   Idk if I my thought comes across clear but youre example is saying the person is bi (right?) which says that he's doing the bi sexual conduct.   just because you are attracted to the same gender [and opposite]   Then his sexual conduct (relationship with opposite gender) is ""dictated"" by its sexual preference. If that person is only actually attracted to same gender then that's different."
bisexual,3bcdbt,WatHppnsRddtStysRddt,3,Sun Jun 28 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"Its like.. you are a Nurse even if you are at home, not working, right? So you can be bisexual when you are in a relationship with a person of the same or different gender."

bisexual,3bcdbt,doombybbr,98,Sun Jun 28 09:28:09 2015 UTC,"Warning: the following is a bit of a rant.  Yeah, I'm in this exact same position. I'm a cis bi woman currently partnered with a cis man. I've had serious relationships with men and women, cis and trans, before now. I was kicked out of the military under DADT. I lived in the silent, invisible hell that is being the same-sex partner of a closeted military member. I've worked on DADT repeal and civil unions and marriage equality campaigns. But somehow, now that I'm dating a cis man, it's like all my previous experience as being a woman-who-loves-women has gone out the window. I'm no longer part of the family. I seriously had a lesbian tell me I shouldn't be at Pride because, ""You're not really one of us, you ran back to straight privilege."" As though love somehow can choose which gender (or lack thereof!) it wears. As though I know nothing of the oppression of queer people in the USA.  It's very alienating and shaming. It makes me want to turn my back on the whole damn gay community for devaluing the lives of bisexual people and transpeople through that alienation and erasure. And don't even get me started on how racist and classist Gay, Inc. can be! Now that the white GLs with money got the respectability of marriage and military service, the rest of us can go rot, you know? For example, I'm not exactly holding my breath for a campaign from HRC for the rights of queers in prison or immigrant detention.  I've dealt with this in a few different ways. I've found my place in spiritual and political circles that aren't necessarily queer-centric, but are places where queer people and our experiences and perspective are definitely valued. The common ties that bind us are our love for the larger global justice movement and inclusivity, not just a campaign for marriage. I've started attending a UU church, one that hosts a shelter for queer homeless youth. I work on poverty issues that directly impact queer people, especially queer women of color. I'm out at work; I'm very lucky to be in a state and at a workplace where I can be out without fear of retaliation or losing my job. And I'm out to my partner, who is supportive of me and holds me when I cry about being erased from the queer family I lived in for so many years.  Over the almost four decades I've been on earth I've learned that it's not about finding your place within a certain community, but creating a space within yourself and moving outward from there.   Good luck, and all the love to you."

Everyone should have the right to work without fear of reprisal or firing or not being hired despite being qualified because of who they are. One of the major issues facing queer people, especially transitioning or GNC people, is lack of employment or retaliation and/or harassment on the job. Let's get this done."

I feel the same way about the 'gay movement', I think that the extreme focus on marriage equality has almost made a particular kind of gay person (white, well off, cis) much more accepted to the exclusion of other queer people. It's been difficult to talk to my straight friends about why marriage equality isn't the be-all and end-all of equality for LGBTQ+ people (but I suppose that might be something for another discussion).

My gay friend asked me why I never went to the LGBT club on campus, and I said I was afraid of being judged for being bi, because I have a boyfriend. He said I was being silly, but he's also the same guy who told me (and the guy he was seeing at the time, who was bi), that bi people have it easy because we can ""just choose to date someone of the opposite gender"". I feel like I just wouldn't belong, or I'd be called fake or something."
bisexual,3bcdbt,Mr3p1c0s1ty,17,Sat Jun 27 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"That's such a silly way for LGBT people to view our sexuality though. I can't choose who I love any more than anyone else: if I love a woman, then I love her. That's it, full stop, and same with a guy. I don't get the leisure to pick and choose which gender I ""want"" at the moment just because I'm bisexual. It doesn't work like that.  LGBT people more than anyone else should know that love isn't a choice. Geez."
bisexual,3bcdbt,RoanokeTheTogepi,6,Sun Jun 28 02:57:44 2015 UTC,"This definitely doesn't apply to every college campus, but there really are good people out there in the LGBTQ+ community who acknowledge your identity, no matter what it is.  To start with, I'm a cis male who is pansexual, but originally identified as bisexual. When I first got back into college after a two year break, i decided to check out my college's LGBTQ+ group, having discovered my own sexuality in the previous few years. Also, because I was pretty lonely, as most of my friends were already finished with college by then.  To a bit of a surprise, I was welcomed in open arms, and someone even elected me the treasurer the first day I was there :-) that group became one of the biggest parts of my life, and after a year, I became the co-president.  I'll admit that the experience didn't have its pitfalls or people who didn't respect my identity, that was always a thing. Occasionally, one or two of the old officers of the group made it subtly clear to me that I wasn't worthy or maybe ""not queer enough"", but I stuck it out because how much I loved my new group of friends.  That experience taught me a lot. It taught me just how much I didn't know about queer culture, how much I didn't know about other people's cultures and experiences, and even a lot of valuable leadership and collaboration abilities. It gave me the courage to not only become a part of my student government, but to become its LGBTQ+ representative, a hired and paid position! I've now been all over the state, and I've met almost no one who has went out of their way to erase my non-monosexuality.  In my time in my student group and student government, I've met so many amazing people who are now my closest friends. I even met my current partner, a cis bisexual female while we were preparing for our local pride celebration :-) we've been together for almost two years, and are probably the most queer ""straight"" couple you will ever meet.  So, what I'm trying to get at here, is for you to go for it. There are just too many fabulous reasons to get involved in your campus group, even if you don't have the experience that I did. If there are shitty people, just be yourself, be kind, and most of all, be understanding, because every person has a different life experience and probably knows something that you don't. Maybe eventually they'll learn something from you and change their tune.  Maybe, just maybe, you can be a part of something amazing, changing the world a tiny bit. Maybe, you'll just learn more about yourself, and that's really what college is all about.  Good luck!"
bisexual,3bcdbt,snarkyxanf,12,Sun Jun 28 07:10:13 2015 UTC,"I went to my first pride yesterday, and I did kind of feel that way. Even during the parade there was very little bi representation. But I had to good fortune to meet up with a group of people (although eventually we were whittled down to three) who were very accepting. When it was just the three, two of us were bi and the other was gay, and the gay girl started talking about how there isn't enough representation.   These guys at pride are seriously the most accepting and non-judgemental people you could meet."
bisexual,3bcdbt,RedConverse,11,Sun Jun 28 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel this way -- I've only been in 2 relationships, both with the opposite sex, and I didn't really realize I was bi until well into my current relationship. I've told my boyfriend and he's cool with it, but I'm having a hard time talking about it with my friends, even though most of them are a part of the LGBT community. I'm worried it'll come off as just trying to be in on something they all share in common or something like that. And since I've only been in hetero relationships, we do face a different set of issues. I did go to pride because a gay friend of mine invited me (and they know I'm not completely straight although I haven't said bi yet), and I want to go to campus pride meetings but I worry about how it'll come off since I have a boyfriend and have never actually dated a woman.  I guess basically I worry I'll come off as a straight woman just trying to use the title without having any of the repercussions, or something like that."
bisexual,3bcdbt,ptype,10,Sun Jun 28 02:24:50 2015 UTC,I figure that queer enough to be hated on by the bigots is queer enough to deserve a place at pride.
bisexual,3bcdbt,NyctophobicParanoid,8,Sun Jun 28 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"I've experienced this before. Trying to explain to people that, yes, bisexuality exists and yes, men can be bisexual (such as myself) gets annoying after awhile. For awhile after my boyfriend and I broke up, I felt ashamed to be bisexual. I felt like I didn't have a voice in the LGBT community, like I was half there and I half wasn't. It also didn't help that I couldn't express myself to some of my friends, who come from religious and often ignorant backgrounds.  Like you, I know I'm bisexual. I know that I have attraction towards men and women (and even those who fall all over the spectrum), for a long time. What I'm starting to do is find a nitche of my own, to align myself with like minded people, be they gay, straight, bisexual, etc. who understand that we bisexuals do exist and that we're here and we have a voice!"
bisexual,3bcdbt,Glarks,9,Sun Jun 28 01:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a bi girl who just got engaged to a guy. I pretty much had a neurotic breakdown over whether it was appropriate to put the Facebook pride rainbow overlay thingy on my profile pic showing me and my fiancé just after the proposal. Which is ridiculous since there are tons of straight people on my feed right now with the exact same rainbow overlay. So I'd say, yeah, I'm pretty worried about that sort of thing.   It's very frustrating when there are two things I care very very much about, but in so many people's eyes one (my fiance) negates the other (my queer identity).  I feel like the only way to combat it is to be more out and proud, but it is so hard..."
bisexual,3bcdbt,suzily,8,Sun Jun 28 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"This is the first year I've felt this really hard, but I always feel a bit of it. I've done a lot of activism for the LGBT community, volunteered, worked pride parades, but it all seems to go by the wayside since I've ended up long term partnered with a guy. Gets really old, really fast, but especially around Pride."
bisexual,3bcdbt,ahatmadeofshoes12,6,Sun Jun 28 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"You know what? I've never felt good enough for anything in my life. I've stopped caring, and I will be good enough for whatever I damn well decide to be good enough for.  I'm an open bisexual BECAUSE I DECIDED TO OWN IT. I wear my hair the way I do BECAUSE I DECIDED TO OWN IT. I keep the company I keep BECAUSE I DECIDED TO OWN IT. And I will be proud of myself and I will feel pride for LGBT issues BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO OWN IT. I'm good enough because I decide I am, and fuck everyone else.  This message brought to you by Icehouse."
bisexual,3bcdbt,zizzymoo,4,Sun Jun 28 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"I walked in the NYC pride parade for years (always by accident, but I marched nontheless).  When gay marriage passed in NY I was a very excited observer.  However, I was there with my male fiance.  I felt like an outsider for the first time since I was 18.  Regardless of my excitement, it was no longer mine.  Now, a couple of years later, I feel very differently.  If I were there at the march tomorrow (and I really wish I could be) I would probably find myself in the march again at some point.  If anything, I am further from the community than I was (spending a year raising an infant will do that), but I know that it's still mine. Being a bi parent makes a difference, though I am not sure how to describe the change."
bisexual,3bcdbt,Angeldown,7,Sun Jun 28 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't go and assert yourself as queer you'll continue to stay invisible. That's what keeps me out and motivated me to paint a bi flag on my face and the word ""queer"" on my back. I don't care if my partner is male I have never been straight and honestly outside of my attraction to him I'm rarely ever attracted to men.   I was happy I marched with PFLAG and it was one of the most inclusive groups with half the people who marched with us being trans and/or genderqueer. Unfortunately the LGBT community is going to continue to be the LG community if the rest of us don't stand up and demand inclusion."
bisexual,3bcdbt,Angeldown,11,Sun Jun 28 15:50:19 2015 UTC,"Whenever someone tells me I'm not 'really bi' because I'm now married to a man (I'm a woman), I ask them if they cease to be gay/lesbian whenever they're single.  They say, ""of course not!""  I say, ""so you don't turn into a heterosexual just because you're not fucking someone of the same sex?""  And they say, ""of course not!""    You can probably guess my response to that:  ""Neither do I.""  I've had people try and alienate me from my 'place' in the LGBT community for most of the last 30+ years.  From my very first Pride in the 80s and all across the decades, there's always been some asshole (or group of assholes) who try to tell me I'm ""not gay enough,"" EVEN when I was dating a woman.  All because I'm bisexual.  So, for the record, is my husband.  Yesterday my husband and I were out most of the day... and maybe because of where we live (rural Michigan), and probably because of the radio station we were listening to (local small-town station), we didn't actually hear the news until we got home - the same time we got back into cell tower range and our phones lit up with texts LOL  We sat here reading the various news stories out loud to each other, sobbing our little hearts out with happiness, a never-ending stream of tears running down our faces as we soaked up as much information about the ruling that we could.  Then we spent another hour sending out congratulatory texts/emails/Facebook messages to damn near everyone we know.  ""Not gay enough""?    We won yesterday because of the thousands upon thousands of hours that dedicated LGBTs have put in over the last 40+ years towards equality advocacy... no small number of which have been put in by me and my husband... even though we've been together over 15 years and didn't NEED the right to marry each other.  We didn't stop just because we met, fell in love and got married... if anything, we worked HARDER, so that our friends could share the same benefits that we do.  No one is going to ever make me feel like I'm ""not gay enough,"" just because I sleep with an outie instead of an innie.  That rainbow is as much ours as it is the L's, G's & T's... and maybe more so, because we weren't fighting for ourselves... we fought FOR THEM.    So you go to Pride... and you hold your head high... and you remind yourself and everyone else that you ARE ""gay enough"" - because that isn't measured by who you are fucking but rather it is measured by who you are."

bisexual,3bcdbt,totally_jawsome,4,Sun Jun 28 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel this.  I've dated one girl ever, during high school.  I've been attracted to other women, but the opportunity for relationships have just never occurred.  I'm currently in a long-term, committed relationship with a guy (he is also bisexual), and I strongly feel that he may be the one I spend the rest of my life with.  This is awesome, and wonderful.  But it also makes me feel like I somehow don't fit in with my gay friends.  Like, I can go to a pride event, but I'll seem more like an ""Ally"" than an actual member of the community.  I think part of it is that I know I can sort of avoid the stigma and suffering that a lot of other LGBTQ people have to go through.  I've found a member of the opposite sex that I love, and because of that, to most people, I just sort of seem straight, and there's no real reason for me to walk around proclaiming to the world that I'm not.  So I sort of feel like there might be a level of exclusion and bitterness because I don't have to endure what they do, so why should I get to be a part of their group?  If that makes sense.  I went through hell in high school for the lesbian relationship I was in back then, but I feel like I shouldn't feel the need to bring that up as some sort of ""proof"" that I belong."
bisexual,3bcdbt,unrustlable,4,Sun Jun 28 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"100% this. I feel like my lack of same-sex relationships somehow diminishes my bi/pan identity because I can 'pass' for straight, if that makes any sense? Especially since most of my bi friends (who don't live close by anyway) have had more same-sex relationships than me, or are currently in same-sex relationships, making them look 'more gay' than me. I know it's ridiculous to base the validity of my sexuality on how I appear to others but it kind of gets to me sometimes that I'm not able to express this part of myself for various reasons. The rest of the comments in this thread have been helpful, though :)"
bisexual,3bcdbt,omnipedia,3,Sun Jun 28 18:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly!  I think with me, it sort of helps that my boyfriend is also bisexual, and he's pretty fruity about it (it a really adorable way).  So I have that companionship with someone else who understands how completely valid it is to be bi.  But around other gay friends and just at gay events I definitely feel that sense of ""not being gay enough.""  I guess we just gotta own it for ourselves!"

I went to south London yesterday and decided to walk through London, as it was Pride. I am a well built guy and really 'non-scene', often told I look like the lead singer of system of a down.  I felt very distant from the crowd, but I expect it was because I wasnt covered in rainbows, for the record, i love rainbows. I felt I should have worn my Android pride t shirt, at the very least.

I really didn't expect to get so many positive responses, I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way. Part of why I feel so alienated might be that most of my friends (at least the ones who live nearby) are straight, so I've kind of been trapped in a 'heterosexual bubble' for a while which feels kind of stifling. This thread has made me realise that I really need to get out and enter more queer spaces/go to Pride/be a more active member of the LGBT community, for me and for bi visibility in general.  Alsoooo...I guess I'm not quite as invisible as I had thought, because my little sister (who didn't know I was bi, as far as I'm aware) messaged me a few hours after I posted this thread & came out to me!!   thank you /u/ApacheFlame for linking photos of the Pride parade I missed 😊"

bisexual,3bcdbt,firmicute,3,Sun Jun 28 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"We all know that feeling.  All of us.  I remember reading a facebook account dedicated to insisting that Bi people in het relationships don't belong in LGBT spaces, and full, naturally, of the insistance that we ""manipulate and hurt lesbians"", that there's no such thing as Biphobia. I remember crying over the things someone I never met, never knew, had to say about me. Bi people have been refused asylum in the UK from a country where being gay is illegal, because their sexuality was ""disingenuous"".  Here's the thing, fuck those people. The generation of Bi people before you fought to put that B in there, fought for your rights as a queer individual and your right to be there. You do belong in queer space.  You are a valuable member of the queer community.  You don't have to prove yourself, you don't have to be worried you're not queer enough.  You are right there in the acronym.  Personally, I remember that it's important for me to be proud, to be present, to be visible, to take no shit not just for me, but for the kids who are teenagers now, for kids who need support from the community.  I remember that as a bisexual adult, I need to be here, to make things better for the generation that follows me, just like the people who came before me made things better for me."

bisexual,3becl4,monandwes,11,Sun Jun 28 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"I think the most convincing piece of evidence, at least for me, that monosexually is truly a thing are the gay people who try really really hard to be straight and get married and live in denial for years only to have things fall apart when they finally realize they aren't straight. Even if maybe there was a tiny, miniscule amount of opposite sex attraction, a passing thought or whatever, it just doesn't work for them in practice. I wouldn't call this bisexuality, and I assume they wouldn't either."
bisexual,3becl4,o_bwp7,6,Sun Jun 28 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"As someone who has lived through this, I think part of the miscommunication, for bisexual people who have a hard time conceptualizing being exclusively straight or gay, is that there still is a pretty big taboo on talking about what it feels like to not be attracted to a gender. As a lesbian, my non-attraction to men feels like something. It's not revulsion, as many people assume, but it's not neutral, either. There's something about the male gender that registers to me on a different level, in my brain. I can have very intense feelings of friendship, and even love, for men, but it has a very different emotional resonance for me.  People don't like to talk about this, though. I don't totally understand why."
bisexual,3becl4,rosecoloredswan,3,Mon Jun 29 00:43:03 2015 UTC,"That's probably the most convincing thing I've heard. Not that I needed convincing, exactly, but it's still real good."
bisexual,3becl4,thatoneguy54,4,Sun Jun 28 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's a difference between thinking about something versus really feeling something. Like, I've daydreamed about being an astronaut but I've never actually wanted to become one. Or for another example, plenty if people have fun crossdressing once or twice for Halloween or some such without feeling gender dysphoria. Having a bicurious thought doesn't mean that someone is necessarily sublimating bisexual feelings.   However, to address the spirit of your question, I know people that aren't just not attracted to their own gender, they get grossed out thinking about their own gender."
bisexual,3becl4,hybbprqag,4,Sun Jun 28 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"Due to the fact that basic human nature is to be curious, I'd imagine that everyone has at least had one fleeting thought of it.   Whether or not they're willing to admit it is a whole different story."

bisexual,3becl4,beerbabe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:32:53 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily hate or like it. I just won't get out of my way to eat it. This might lighten the reason a bit at least for me. It's basically just water with some redness and a little bit of taste. Other watermelon even have seeds which is a hassle or extra energy to do for such a warm shaved ice with red food coloring.
bisexual,3becl4,WatHppnsRddtStysRddt,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:32:21 2015 UTC,Me too!!  I subscribe to the theory of no one is entirely straight or gay (although many on both sides disagree).  I think most people obviously lean towards one or the other but most at least have curious thoughts.  Whether they ever admit it or even act on it is a different story!!

I understand what you mean about the sexual attraction rather than emotional, I like sex with cis men but relationships with them suck. I like sex with women and prefer the types of relationships I have with them - but I will still see a picture of a hot dude or see one on the bus and go nope - Still bi."
bisexual,3bcz1l,berlin_chair_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:13:00 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I feel. I'm hard on myself because it doesn't seem like I can't be legitimately bi unless I have stronger feelings for men.  I guess I've always believed that bisexual meant that you fell right in the middle of straight or gay, and that you had to have equal feelings for both sides to qualify."
bisexual,3bcz1l,Zhuangzifreak,9,Sun Jun 28 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"It's actually more common for bisexual women to first come out lesbian than vice versa.   This is a very normal feeling that you are feeling. We have been pushed by society to believe that there is something less legitimate about the bisexual identity. Please come back here as many times as you can, and ""like"" the BiNet USA group on Facebook if you use it. Accepting yourself takes time and other people's support. Please reach out to us, and we will help you as best we can. :)"
bisexual,3bcz1l,beccabug,2,Sun Jun 28 04:30:58 2015 UTC,"Well I'm just gonna remind you that you can't really ever be ""bi enough"", so you shouldn't beat yourself up about it. I've never had a girlfriend or even close female friendships for that matter. Never been involved with anyone trans, or genderqueer, or gender fluid, or any other gender besides cis males but I still call myself pansexual. And when I think about, the idea I can't be pan unless I've been with every gender is silly.  I felt fake at first too, but the more I just sat and tried to accept my feelings as legitimate, the better I felt about everything. So just remember that you don't have to prove anything to yourself or to anyone else. You are bi because you are bi, that's all there is to it. You can have stronger attractions to one gender over others at different times, but it doesn't make you less of a bisexual."

Even ignoring heterosexuality/opposite sex attraction people are often into, sometimes exclusively, a body type/gender expression/etc. that differs significantly from their own.   From your last paragraph it sounds like you do have some body image issues, but there's nothing wrong with liking people who are physically/superficially different from yourself. There's a difference between wanting to be like someone and wanting to be with someone, maybe super thin girls are just your thing.  (also FWIW I'm a pretty tiny girl with a thing for bigger women, definitely sexy yo)"
bisexual,3bd9v7,bisexualwizard,2,Sun Jun 28 05:42:54 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, thank you SO much for all your points.  Of course! I didn't even think to compare it to heterosexual relationships- I for some reason attract bodybuilders. Definitely not the same body type as me.  And I was secretly worried that my attraction wouldn't find someone who so creepy reciprocated... So you saying you're into bigger women gave me so much hope."
bisexual,3bd9v7,beerbabe,4,Sun Jun 28 05:48:32 2015 UTC,I'm a skinny lady that loves bigger women too! We just have different bodies. Just because you're attracted to something doesn't mean that the other isn't just as good for someone else!
bisexual,3bd9v7,keshanu,2,Sun Jun 28 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a type. It is only a problem when people shame others for not conforming to their personal beauty ideals or for having a different type.  Since I was young, I have always struggled with the idea that I'm unattractive and because of that I took it as a serious moral responsibility that looks couldn't factor at all into how much I could love a person. It wasn't until I started dating my boyfriend that I realized that even if I'm not conventionally attractive, some people will find me attractive and I deserve just as much to be in a relationship with someone who I find physically attractive. I'm not a bad person just because I require to be at least somewhat physically attracted to someone before I feel sexual and romantic attraction. After realizing that, I've been a lot happier with myself.  So you should not be ashamed that you prefer thin women or that you aren't thin yourself. Considering you are model too, I'm sure they are plenty of women out there who will think you are super sexy!"

However - if it's a tall dude I'm climbing him like a mighty man tree. It reminds me of a girl I knew who was also bigger and always constantly upset with herself for not actually being ok with the 'hard-line political poly party line' because she was told it was the most 'ethically sound' line to toe and when she had doubts or thought otherwise she really beat herself up for not being as hardcore about the things she so desperately wanted to believe."
bisexual,3bd9v7,Kasta_Fire,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"I can relate. So much.   I'm a bigger girl and I never had trouble believing that the guys I was sleeping with found me attractive, I know I'm sexy, damn it! But when I started dating my girlfriend who is a lot slimmer than I am, I had a crazy amount of self-doubt. How can I believe I'm attractive if the girl if I find the hottest in the world had such a different body type than mine?  I finally managed to think about it like this: 1- I like my body in a functional way: I like my body because it's strong, I can walk around town, I can lift heavy things at work, my body is a useful tool and overall I am happy with how it functions, although I wish my knees didn't dislocate so easily. 2- My body type is not the type I find sexually attractive and that's okay. It helped to realise that there are bigger girls that have different body shapes that I do find attractive and smaller girls that I don't necessarily find attractive. It's not just internalized body-shame. It's just who I am attracted to.  3- My body is sexually attractive to others. And I can accept that and be happy about it. I like that people notice my tits. I like that seeing me naked turns on my girlfriend. I can accept and understand that others find me sexually attractive without wanting to sleep with someone who could be my clone.  I think there's also a lot of value in what other people said that we are often attracted to people who are very different from us. That doesn't mean we love ourselves any less."

It's appalling to most (even straight people of all generations) that it's illegal in some places.

It's a bit intense at times but it's the most comprehensive nonfiction bi book I've read.  I loved Not Otherwise Specified by Hannah Moskowitz. It's YA but it delves into biphobia (especially in the lesbian community) and mental health a lot. It's one of the only books I know of where the character explicitly talks about their bisexuality rather than just being a bi character. But if you're interested in the latter too, I can give you more suggestions!"

bisexual,3batda,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:22:44 2015 UTC,No prob :) I'm pretty sure these are all categorized as YA; adult fiction has a serious lack of bi characters aside from erotic romance novels. Maybe that'll change soon.  The Adaptation series by Malinda Lo  Bi-Normal and Best Bi Short Stories by M.G.

It might make men less likely to approach you, but that's not relevant right now with your girlfriend, and in the future you can always approach men yourself and they'll get the hint quick enough.

bisexual,3b9q1a,Kiwilolo,3,Sat Jun 27 08:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to realize that people get into themselves. Guys saw you were female and expected someone that could be ""offended"" by being called a lesbian. Many men (especially on reddit) preach the good word of modest makeup, long hair, no piercings or tattoos, no hair dye. Not every guy, of course. However, it's a thing. You threw them off because the argument was for you to be more feminine in their narrow view of it.  My advice? Ignore them and try your best not to let it get you down. These folks aren't your audience. Also, what does looking like a lesbian even mean really? I'd pay good money to look like Portia de Rossi. Of course, I get what they're saying but it's a limited or very specific view of attractiveness.   If you're interested in feedback on your appearance, I'd be more specific. Skin, hair, makeup-- Take what you like and continue doing it. The things you want feedback on, go to specific subs (skincareaddiction, makeupaddiction)."

I recommend /r/sugarfreemua for good advice, since while they're blunt, they're not hateful.  I will say that you're hair is still in an alternative style and will throw some people off. It frames your face well, though. Your makeup is nice, too, as long as you stay away from thick under-eyeliner; large wings and bright lipstick are hardly unheard of. So, no, you're not ugly, just a bit ""unexpected"" for many people."

Who knows what you are? You'll get it figured out eventually. Meanwhile, just don't judge yourself for whatever feelings you have. Many, many straight guys have homosexual thoughts and feelings, especially in adolescence. It doesn't mean you're gay, or even bi. It means you're a teenager. They get turned on by just about anything under the sun.   You might turn out to be gay, bi, or straight. It something else entirely.

I'm not saying that is the case for you but that is my personal experience. I used to think ""well I like girls, so I must be straight."" Of course how you identify will inevitably be up to you.  Just take time to understand how you really feel. Not everything is black and white, some things can be confusing when we tread the grey line. It's also perfectly fine to feel how you do so don't be ashamed or afraid to look deeper within yourself."

bisexual,3b8hh2,Zhuangzifreak,3,Fri Jun 26 20:41:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks OP for posting this all over the relevant subreddits. For everyone else, here's my initial reaction to reading this:    THIS, THIS, A THOUSAND TIME THIS!!  For all the people who have called me transphobic or told I had to be pansexual or queer because I'm genderqueer, I wish this sentiment was easier to get through their thick skulls. I'm tired of the erasure and bigotry and I'm glad my other genderqueer bisexuals are too."
bisexual,3b8hh2,purpleblossom,2,Fri Jun 26 20:53:45 2015 UTC,"This whole idea that bisexuality is intrinsically transphobic always confused me. I mean, first off, bisexuals have been generally consistent allies: both transgender and bisexual people find themselves excluded from many LGBT safe spaces and/or seen as a threat to the advancement of the lesbian and gay community, and it is we who together founded the more modern queer movements and refuse to do to other oppressed groups as the lesbian and gay community have done to us. I do not know a single transphobic bisexual person, and I know a lot of individuals from both groups.  Secondly... I'm bi! I'm trans! No conflicts! Even if you take ""bisexuality"" to be intrinsically binary (and I don't know anyone who's bi who does)... I'm trans yet binary! Many of us are! I was born male and identify 100% woman, have since completely transitioned to female. So even a straw bisexual (who liked women like me of course) would find no difficulties with me. So it cannot be intrinsically transphobic.  Gaaaah so many issues to be fought in the community and this is the hill they want us to fight on? </rant>"

bisexual,3b8hv8,djoms,3,Fri Jun 26 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely experience sexual anxiety. I too get extremely hard at foreplay, but sometimes right before I have sex I get this worry that I won't stay hard and sure enough it happens. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, because I know it wouldn't happen if I wasn't worried about it happening. The stress and anxiety manifests itself from a fear that I will disappoint her, which I believe stems from an ex-girlfriend that made sex extremely stressful like that. The point is, it existed before I even had bisexual urges. I'm also very analytical and 21, so I'm of a somewhat similar background.   First off, are you on any SSRIs at the moment? If so, that often causes an inability to orgasm and decreased sexual satisfaction. I noticed a huge improvement when I got off of those medications.  Second, there's no easy trick to breaking it unfortunately. What I've found helps making sex into the least stressful environment possible. Explain what you're feeling to your girlfriend and tell her what helps you. For me, it's laughing together and substituting sex with more foreplay until I'm ready to try again. By making it a non-issue, she knows it has nothing to do with her and that given more time I'll probably get hard and stay hard. Just don't put the weight of this on your shoulders, and remember it's not a big a deal and plenty of guys are in the same boat as you.  The key is to break the cycle. The more positive experiences you have using whatever method helps you, the less the anxiety is present. It's all about reducing the association between sex and anxiety, and that just takes time. With men, I have no anxiety because I don't have that conditioned response. With women I've found the anxiety has gotten less and less as time goes on."
bisexual,3b8hv8,DowntownUpstate,2,Sat Jun 27 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could tell you how to fix this, but I can't. I've struggled with it in the past too. I don't think it was 100% because of my interest in men though. I think it was probably more to do with a lack of communication. It's hard to enjoy it if the other person doesn't appear to be enjoying it. I'd talk to her. Just be careful not to make it come across as anyone's fault and obviously stress that you still want to have lots of sex with her ;)  If the anxiety about being interested in men is driving you crazy, maybe you need to explore it to reach some conclusion or level of peace with yourself? At any rate you should consider what is more important to you. You're young enough that exploring would be fairly accessible, but do you really want to give up a perfectly good relationship for an unknown? You deserve to be happy and in the end that's what should guide your decision. If you aren't happy with the sex, and you don't want to work on it, then go try something different."
bisexual,3b8hv8,Neediiknow,2,Fri Jun 26 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you both for your replies!  @Neediiknow We communicate. A lot. Sometimes even too much where it gets to the point that I hurt her by expressing my thoughts/ feelings.   Yea exploring... This has been on my mind a lot since I'm gonna go on a 6 months student exchange in a month time and feel like this would the perfect opportunity to explore. Although on the other hand I really value her and the relationship we have. Plus, which may sound a bit selfish, if I can't be comfortable with someone I'm so intimate with, how would I ever be able to be comfortable with others I share less with? Makes me feel like I should first fix those 'problems' before experimenting.  From what I read people's experiences of experimenting range from finally confirming who they really are and pure euphoria or just becoming more confused and ashamed and everything in between. In light of my previous sex experiences and my neurotic tendencies I would probably experience the latter. Although of course I will never know until I experience it, but still, it is a point to consider. Did you feel more at peace or reach a conclusion when you started exploring?  @DowntownUpstate I feel u... The mind is unpredictable haha. At the least expected times I spontaneously get horny, have amazing sex and only after I came I realize how amazing it was and that my anxieties were absent. No I'm not on SSRIs nor do I experience any depressive symptoms. It does me really good to know that you're in a similar situation as me =), did u feel like your anxieties with women decreased when u started exploring with  men?  Oh yea, now I also remember why I relate this anxiety to not exploring my homosexual side. One time my gf anally fingered me (without me coming) and the days afterwards my sex drive was enormous. The weird thing was that both my desire for men and women increased a lot. Normally I prefer fantasizing about women only but those days I fantasized about everybody and their cats and it felt good. As if a secret reservoir of libido was opened up. We tried again recently but then my sex drive didn't have that change."

Bisexuals tend to blur the attraction gender lines so it stands to reason that it wouldn't be as prevalent.   I wonder what all this looks like in a place where the culture around gender is different. Like, I remember there was an African tribe that had Men dressing up in makeup and fancy clothes to attract women that farmed and hunted. What would Bisexuality look like there?

bisexual,3b5n5m,butaraga,15,Fri Jun 26 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"""Am I allowed to call myself bisexual despite my lack of experience?""  Absolutely. If you were hetero and didn't have sex, fall in love, or even date someone of the opposite sex, would you be less straight? No, of course not.  You know who you are (or will figure it out if you're not settled) and your orientation isn't determined by experience at all.   Chin up. Relax. Try not to stress too much about the labels. Just try talking to a lady you're attracted to. If nothing comes of it, you're at least getting your feet wet and you'll be used to the water in no time... or something will come of it. <3 <3 <3"
bisexual,3b5n5m,thethumbprint,10,Fri Jun 26 04:48:43 2015 UTC,"You are going through a very common issue: can I identify as bi if I don't have any same-sex experience?  The answer is absolutely YES. Straight people never have to prove their straightness. If you met a straight virgin, would you doubt their straightness? Of course not. So just like straight people, you don't have to have any type of sex whatsoever to be 'allowed' to call yourself bi.  Bi and gay/lesbian are 'othered' in our society. There was a big issue over the movie ""Imitation Game"" because they didn't show any gay sex in it. People accused the director of shying away, not being brave enough to show gay sex. That is one argument, but another argument says ""Why do you have to see this person have sex to prove their sexuality?""  The answer is that you don't. You don't need to prove it. Even if you never had sex in your whole life, you are still allowed to claim any identity that feels true to you.  If you are attracted to men and women, and you can absolutely call yourself bisexual. There are no requirements, rules, outlines or anything else. If the label is comfortable to you, then it's the right one.  :)"

You have no obligation to do anything sexual with anyone, ever. There are people who discover they're bisexual after being happily married, and the only practical difference it ever makes is in terms of their sexual fantasies or what sort of videos they like to watch. It's not something that obligates you to add yourself to anyone else's dating pool (though there are a few idiots out there who might attempt to convince you otherwise, and you can safely laugh at and then ignore them.)"
bisexual,3b5n5m,Chris770,3,Fri Jun 26 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"YES! You are bi if you say you are.   The standard definition is, you're bi if you're attracted to people of multiple genders, at least some of the time. But you can feel free to identify any way you please. You know your own identity best.   And in my opinion, having read your story: You're bi. Bi as hell. You're so bi, you probably have two of everything in your house.

My good friend who happens to be bisexual has been married to her wife for over a year. bisexuals can and you marry the same sex. And even if somebody is by and the end up in an opposite gender relationship that doesn't mean that they aren't bi. My mom used to say the same stuff that bisexuals are really people that just experiment but eventually they choose when they get married. It just goes back to the stupid views that people stop being attracted to others when they get married which is just not true. even in monogamous relationships people still feel attraction for others. of course I don't buy into monogamy for my personal relationships either even though I know it works for a lot of people. I actually think my alternative relationships would probably upset my parents even more than my sexual fluidity.

And re: parents and non-monogamy – Haha oh lord, I tried having the ""uhm so I don't really do monogamous relationships"" talk with my mom before I told her about the bi thing, and she just... could not compute.

First my counselor (which was easy, just a box on a form). Then to my closest friend at uni, which was totally scary and my heart was pounding, but it was great to tell someone and to have someone to talk about stuff with.   It's hard to bring it up, it can be easier if you throw it into conversation as a part of something else. Like I came out to my little sister when I was talking about my concerns traveling to Tanzania as a queer person. Or when I came out to my room mate by asking her how I should casually mention I am bi when filling out a scholarship application. Or to my other friend when I mentioned I had a crush on a girl working at the thrift shop.  Or you can just get kinda drunk at a party and tell several friends and be pleasantly surprised how many are also bi and how accepting everyone is!

Even if you are rejected, I doubt it will be as awkward as you think it might be.  Plus, the more you ask people out, or express your attraction, the easier it gets.

bisexual,3b2nm7,ahatmadeofshoes12,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:38:50 2015 UTC,This would probably be a lot harder to set up though. it's been my experience in the poly community that it's very hard to find bi guys that are interested in triads or threesomes. Even though there is a stereo type of by women who like to join couples being unicorns it's honestly harder in some ways to find bi men. I'm not sure why this is the case but it might have something to do with the fact that there are fewer bi men who feel comfortable identifying that way because the stigma for bi men is much greater. it would probably be much easier to find someone for a solo encounter. but they will have to see its just going to be a difficult process.

bisexual,3azbwm,Zhuangzifreak,20,Wed Jun 24 18:35:53 2015 UTC,Confusing: would a publication called 'Bimonthly' publish every two months or every month and be about bisexuality?

bisexual,3azbwm,PatHeist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:02:25 2015 UTC,You could just make it 'bibimonthly' and post twice every two months. You might have to change your name to 'Bibi' though...

bisexual,3azbwm,Southernbelllle,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:50:57 2015 UTC,"Semi means half, therefore there are 24 semi months in one year. Bi means two, therefore there are 6 bimonths in a year."
bisexual,3azbwm,PatHeist,2,Thu Jun 25 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"Bimonthly could be interpreted as bimonth-ly or bi-monthly, being either something that happens at a two month interval, or something that happens twice a month."
bisexual,3azbwm,Southernbelllle,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:15:43 2015 UTC,Our language has devolved because people don't know their fractions and don't care to correct it. Now something that is mistake is now definitive.
bisexual,3azbwm,PatHeist,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"Or, there's the much more simple answer, which is that the word is ambiguous and no mistake needs to be made for it to be used either way? Also, other words like 'biannual' are always used to describe things that happen twice in the period of time, while having other forms like biennial to describe things that happen, in this case, every two years. So your reasoning for there being 6 bimonthly periods in a year doesn't really work out, does it?"
bisexual,3azbwm,Southernbelllle,0,Thu Jun 25 20:01:22 2015 UTC,When we get paid biweekly no one expects two checks in one week. Simple math shouldn't be hard but apparently for some it is.   People make simple mistakes and run with it; it happens.
bisexual,3azbwm,PatHeist,2,Thu Jun 25 20:15:24 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe that's because language isn't fucking mathematics, then?

If you were bi, you'd more likely be into a guy's chest, arms, his smell, etc.  There are a large number of men-- I once heard them called dick fetishists-- who want nothing to do with the guy at all. They just want the dick and don't want to play with, or even be aware of, the dude that the dick is attached to.  Many of these men find pre-operative MTF transexuals to be very appealing. Because you know, it's a woman... but there's a penis. She smells like a girl, there's some breasts, but a dick to suck. A man who dates a trans woman with a penis is considered to be heterosexual.     Edit: I included a collection of words here to describe how these men were called in the sex trade over the last half-century or so, and also mentioned that the terms were now considered offensive. A trans person asked me to strike that section, as even mentioning the terms exist was in itself offensive. While I disagree with the entire concept that terms which were in common trade usage should be scrubbed forever from discussion, I have done so to preserve the peace."

You're perpetuating a huge culture of fetishizing and othering trans ladies.  There is a reason why in the community the moment someone mentions a guy is a ""tranny chaser"" you'll see a mass exodus to get away from him."

But the fact is, you're focusing on the one part of them that the majority wish weren't there, and naturally that comes with a lot issues.  It's not the ""tranny"" part that bothers me, since you made clear it's derogatory. It's the ""oh yeah tons of people enjoy MtF people for this!"" thing. He's really only going to find these people if he pays for them. This isn't normal sexuality for the majority of trans ladies.

I mentioned that I just thought a disclaimer as to the fact that there isn't going to be any takers outside of the sex work industry might be in order.  The myth that dating a pre-op trans women is going to get you access to penis is spread a lot around reddit, and I'm just trying to educate where I can. I can point you to a bazillion posts of actual trans people that hate the fact that people's first inclination is ""Like dick? Don't like guys? Date a trans woman!""  It's not a cut-and-dry subject, and much of the hurt and anger is wrapped up in the long history of treating trans women as a shameful side dish. I just think that offering this advice blindly without regards to the people you're potentially fetishizing isn't okay, that's all."

I don't have any trouble being honest with myself (or with you all, anonymously) about what my attractions / desires are - I'm not attracted to guys and suppressing it or anything, if that's what you're wondering.  When I think about this, it's just a dick in my mouth, not a guy. The guy just goes with the territory. Does that make any sense?  I don't see guys and think/feel ""damn, I want that"", ever. I can obviously appreciate attractiveness in men, but it doesn't really do anything for me.

bisexual,3azezt,Zhuangzifreak,14,Wed Jun 24 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"I rarely see the gender binary discussed by gay people on OKCupid, and certainly never by straight people -- even though, of course, the concepts of homosexuality and heterosexuality imply a gender binary as well. Gay people and straight people simply don't seem to worry that their sexual orientation is inherently offensive to the people they'd like to date.   This is so true and it's something I wish that people would bring up more. This is why I've always thought it was biphobic to accuse someone of not being into people with a non-binary gender just because they identify as bi. The entire concept of a heterosexual/bisexual/homosexual spectrum isn't really good at incorporating non-binary gender identities. Why is it always bi people who are told we should identify as pansexual, otherwise we are transphobic?  There was a discussion on TwoXChromosomes the other day where quite a few people were saying that bi people are only into men and women and if you like people of all genders, then you should identify as pan. It really made me angry. For me, my bisexuality is about being attracted to people of all genders, not just men and women. No one assumes that someone who is gay or straight is not attracted to people with a non-binary gender."

The argument over pansexual and bisexual often insists 'bisexual' isn't enough to indicate a person might be attracted to those transpeople."
bisexual,3azezt,ArgyleMK,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:54:53 2015 UTC,"The whole 'two genders - mine and others' works quite well, but then it doesn't flow as well as 'bisexual'. What word would you propose - using pansexual instead? I prefer bisexual mainly because more people know what it means."
bisexual,3azezt,SmaragdineSon,3,Thu Jun 25 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"I'm saying 'bi' is fine if you're into other genders too. In all of the arguments over 'bi' vs 'pan', many of us bi folk have explicitly said we fancy the others along with male and female."
bisexual,3azezt,ArgyleMK,5,Thu Jun 25 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"This article gives a different perspective from those of us not afraid to identify as bisexual, and argues against the semantic demands that dictate how bisexuals are supposed to identify themselves and to whom they are to be attracted.

bisexual,3azezt,GreatKhanoftheBears,4,Thu Jun 25 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"I think the reluctance to use the term bisexual boils down to internalized biphobia.  The word bisexual has such a negative connotation, that even bisexuals (as in, potential to be attracted to one's own gender and other genders) don't want to be associated with it.  That's how you get ridiculous statements like ""I'm attracted to men and women - but I'm not bisexual!"""

I also lost interest in girls after I hadn't seen my crush in a while but the feelings eventually came back. It's kind of like a cycle.. sometimes I'll be more attracted to guys than girls and vice versa, sometimes I'm equally attracted to all of them. Maybe you'll feel like that too at some point and if you do, that's great, and if you don't that's ok too.. I don't know if you are in denial but its awesome that you were able to come out to yourself, that's really a big step like /u/Flaglerguy said. Hope everything works out for you. You just keep doing you"
bisexual,3b153t,astro2D,3,Thu Jun 25 04:30:14 2015 UTC,"Well remember there is no ""right"" way to be Bi. It doesn't have to be a 50/50 thing.  For me, I am a guy, and I favor women.   I go through phases where I'll be attracted to men, and another phase where i'm attracted to women and a completely different phases where I'm attracted to both at the same time.  It can be rough being unsure of yourself. saying your Bi. It's something I have trouble with. I've only accepted it myself afew months back. Since my attraction isn't 50/50 and when I'm going through a phase where I don't have any attraction to men, i question if I really am Bi sometimes.  But I know I am. And there are times when I think ""There is no way I am not Bi""  So even if you aren't currently attracted to any guys, it doesn't mean you aren't bi. I can't say if it will get easier because I haven't been down this road much myself. But hopefully with others telling their stories it can help. I don't post much on this sub, but even just lurking has helped me a ton."

Maybe You're just picky, or maybe You're straight indeed, there's no accurate way to prove it yet. You're young, don't rush it.   I'm questioning as well (new to the sub) and one thing I learned here is that many bisexuals experience attraction ""cycles"" (prefer same-sex for a while, then opposite, then both, then opposite again and so on) which can cause a lot of confusion.  Maybe look for some romantic gay/bi movies featuring boys to see if it causes some effect? I suppose this sub can offer some suggestions."

bisexual,3b0sml,TheQuietudeAbides,3,Thu Jun 25 12:52:57 2015 UTC,I told my wife while we were cleaning the kitchen one night after dinner. I just sort of blurted it out. She could not have been more accepting and supportive.  There is nothing to it but to do it my friend.
bisexual,3b1gp3,greenthumb95,5,Thu Jun 25 05:06:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what's your question? Why do you need a female opinion in particular?"
bisexual,3b1gp3,light_sky,3,Thu Jun 25 07:30:26 2015 UTC,"Not to offer too scathing a moral judgement but what seems to be the main problem here is that you sought advice from her female friends - it's super inappropriate to go to them before you go to her - your wife is the person to share your concerns with - and think how belittling it is to know that your friends know something about your relationship before you do. The best friend did the right thing, letting you know that you should have spoken to your wife first.   There doesn't seem to be a question here - but great that you are seeking therapy to help yourself through it. You both need to approach the situation with as much empathy for one another as possible.   As a woman, who has dated a man who claimed to be bi and then had trouble performing - it is emotionally destructive. I thought I didn't care one way or another, but because of this his sexuality became an issue. You feel like you are not attractive, your confidence plummets, because he is not sleeping with you, then trust issues develop as well. We loved each other, but as I grew more insecure, he stopped bothering to instigate contact very much - only exacerbating the problem. I knew he missed men, couldn't assume responsibility in our relationship, and pulled the plug.  It was the right thing to do. I'm now in a far happier, more comfortable, more open relationship. I think he's been seeing guys since then, but we don't talk about it because it hits too close to home, despite us having reignited our friendship.  This comment isn't going to provide you with a great deal of happiness or hope, but it's a female opinion as you requested (albeit a slightly bitter one)."
bisexual,3b1gp3,somemetausernamejoke,2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"I think you need to communicate more clearly with your wife.  Trust her more - especially the part about going to her friends over her.  That's a huuuge nono and a big red flag that you didn't trust your own wife to talk to her first about it.  Communication in everything, even non-sexual parts of a relationship, is key so being successful.  What exactly is the therapy for?  I would assume relationship counciling, except for the way you phrased it made it seem like it was just you."

bisexual,3ayy7u,Neediiknow,6,Wed Jun 24 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be easier if I tell my story chronologically: I broke up with my bf last year in August and swore I'd be single for a while. I started working at my school again once September started and met a coworker who interested me since we had fun discussions. I started to become romantically interested in her and that prompted me to examine my bi-curiosity. I had no idea what my limits were - what if I ended up being one of those girls who just experiments for fun but turns out that they're straight? I didn't want to use anyone, however much I did not mean to do so.  It was slow. Normal. I got to know her through more conversations and awkwardly flirted (very subtle; she kinda had some stereotypical clues that she was gay but I didn't want to make assumptions). I asked for her number, we texted a lot, she asked me.for coffee, then we decided to.rock climb together for fun, and by that time I had decided that I had a crush on her long enough that I may as well just ask. It went well! :) we went on our first date not too long after. I was anxious about any unknown limits I had, so I kinda broke down early on one day and called to let her know that I wasn't sure how far I could go or if I had limits. I made it clear that I did not mean to use her and that I genuinely liked her. She said that she understood and that my worries were not uncommon in 'baby gays'. She's big on open communication and we talked a lot and took baby steps. She always made sure that I knew that the ball was in my court and there was no pressure, and if it turned out that I had limits then it was alright and we could still be friends.  One thing that will stick with me was how she explained an attitude in the gay community: always leave someone in better shape than when you found them. I don't know how common this attitude is (I'm not an expert) but she's definitely demonstrated it in the 8 months that we've been together."

The moment I admitted to myself I sometimes had feelings for men was when I realized I could be attracted to different sexes in different ways, and it could still be attraction. I used the label ""bisexual"" for a while, and now am in a place of questioning whether I feel it's accurate or not. Self-knowledge is an evolving process that never quite ends. So don't worry if it takes you a while to figure it out."

bisexual,3ayy7u,EVILGR33NRNGR,2,Thu Jun 25 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the fear of rejection and of being outed. Beyond that, there is no need to be upset with yourself. You've done nothing worthy of criticism. As you said at the end of your first post, this is a journey. Don't be mad at yourself just because you haven't made it further along.

bisexual,3ayy7u,typeBpositive,2,Thu Jun 25 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"Well, you can always dive in and use it as a learning experience for whether it's something you're comfortable with, and then, if it doesn't feel right, don't do it again and wait for a relationship.   Or, if it feels so not-right that you can't bring yourself to do it, don't. Focus instead on meeting people. You could try a gay bar if there's one near you (and if you're old enough), or you could visit a Pride Center (again, if there's one near you) and see if they have a singles' night. There are places out there to meet people. Even if you don't end up in a relationship, you can make friends and a community of support. Explore. Have fun."

Related to this, I think it also makes it easier to come out with and deal with people in the straight world. The problem people have with the bi label is that to some it implies a gender bi-nary as well. It doesn't have to mean that - it can mean genders like yours  and unlike yours, which is how I see it applying to me personally. Hope this helps!"
bisexual,3ax527,fremme,30,Wed Jun 24 05:59:28 2015 UTC,"Nah, I do too. Saying ""bisexual"" is more easily understood by others. I got really tired of questions and bad jokes (""so you like pans?"" haha you're so original)."
bisexual,3ax527,ShiChelle,12,Wed Jun 24 06:00:18 2015 UTC,...But do you like pans? ;)  Or bread? :P

bisexual,3ax527,bisexualwizard,4,Wed Jun 24 10:16:09 2015 UTC,"heh. ""leavened"".  Though seriously, I'm always curious as to if I'm pan and not bi. I don't know how I'd ever find out though, or if it's ethical or even socially appropriate."

bisexual,3ax527,doombybbr,51,Wed Jun 24 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly just don't really agree with the bi/pan distinction. Almost every bisexual person I know is totally fine with the idea of dating a binary trans person, a non-binary trans person, an agender person, a bigender person - whatever. I don't really see why the term pansexual exists except to make it seem like bi people are closed-minded, which most of us really aren't!"
bisexual,3ax527,Fallen_Autumn,2,Wed Jun 24 10:00:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. I have had the wonderful privilege of dating and knowing several bi people over my (so far relatively) short time on this Earth. And all of them have basically said something to the effect of ""gender or lack thereof is inconsequential to my attractions"" which is basically what pansexuality is. The only people who I've ever met actually saying that bisexuality categorically reinforces the essentialist gender binary and excludes attraction to non-binary individuals are people who are straight or gay/lesbian. Not saying that every bisexual person is necessarily attracted to gender nonconforming folks (since bisexuality itself exists as a spectrum) but I really don't understand the need to distinguish between bisexuality and pansexuality since they are - in practice - the same for lots of people."
bisexual,3ax527,cristalmighty,0,Wed Jun 24 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, every bi person I've met in person has had no desire to date a trans* person and one personally told me she wouldn't date a trans guy because if she ended up with a guy she wanted natural-born children.  People can identify with whatever definition they want, but I like pansexual because it's clear cut. There's no waffling around with ""well, how do you define it?"", it's just there and it's obvious."
bisexual,3ax527,axel_val,7,Wed Jun 24 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair that's totally an issue with L and G people as well. It's not exactly uncommon, particularly in lesbian circles, to find ones that won't date trans people. Yet bi people are singled out as particularly transphobic for whatever reason"

I'm totally down for the idea that the use of 'bi' doesn't reinforce a gender binary and all that, but when most people define bi by saying ""both men and women"" it creates a question in some minds.  For what it's worth, I also prefer the terms gynephilia and androphilia to heterosexual and homosexual, because it's clear cut and specific, lol.  It's just a matter of taste."

What about that excludes trans people? That only works if you start from the idea that they're not actually what they identify as. You could maybe make the argument that it excludes non-binary people, but keep in mind not everyone is attracted to non-binary people   For what it's worth, I also prefer the terms gynephilia and androphilia to heterosexual and homosexual, because it's clear cut and specific, lol.  It's just a matter of taste.   Couldn't someone make the argument that both exclude trans people since the fields of gynecology and andrology both refer to reproductive systems? I mean it's an absurd argument but not much more so than the idea that bisexuality is transphobic and binarist"
bisexual,3ax527,cheese93007,2,Wed Jun 24 23:58:49 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, I've seen it online that some trans* people do feel left out by that language.  They identify as being their gender, but being trans* is a big part of their identity and to simply say ""transmen are men"" and such makes them feel weird.  I remember specifically reading a comment about someone who wasn't comfortable with the idea of dating a bisexual person because of that question ""Does this person include trans* people or not"" whereas if they were dating someone who identified as pansexual there would be no doubts.  So it does enter in some people's minds.   not everyone is attracted to non-binary people   That's one of the things I like about the clear-cut nature of pansexual.  Bisexual doesn't say anything about non-binary people and pansexual does.  But at the same time, I'm someone who identifies as genderneutral/genderfluid and my identity doesn't change the fact that my fiance identifies as heterosexual.  I would say it only matters if the person you're interested in is very obviously outside of the binary.  For the prefixes andro and gyne, I'd argue that the only reason we seen them in such a clinical light is because it's the only place we use them in everyday life.  It's not just about the reproductive systems when used in androphilia and gynephilia, it's about the person's expression.  I never said that bisexuality is either of those things and I said I was ok with people using whichever definition of bisexuality they identify with, so I'm not sure why that's a point of contention."
bisexual,3ax527,axel_val,0,Thu Jun 25 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"Is this kinda like, ""I have friends who are...""?  And if, indeed the bisexual community has lost its marbles in the last 25 years and turned its back on its transgender and nonbinary members, that's a betrayal that needs to be actively resisted and argued against. I see little sign that it has lost its marbles in that way."
bisexual,3ax527,cbrachyrhynchos,2,Wed Jun 24 21:33:52 2015 UTC,"It's not the community at large though, it's specific members.  So the community itself is still ok in that area.  But you can't ""actively resist and argue"" against their definition of their sexuality or claim they aren't ""real"" bisexuals either (which I've seen).  And yes, I was responding to Fallen_Autumn having said ""almost every bisexual person I know"" by saying ""every bi person I've met.""  It's not crazy to counter one person's ""I know someone who..."" with ""But I know someone who...""  It was to show the variety within the community."

(That's just a quick skim of the search page.)  Now you say:   And yet, the only people who I've actually seen say that someone's sexuality is ""wrong"" have been bisexual people talking about bisexual people who don't date trans* people.   I don't date ""straight-acting"" people. That's my personal sexuality and preference. But I'm not so egocentric to define bisexuality in terms of my own personal preference. I know that other people have different preferences, therefore, I don't define bisexuality in a way to exclude ""straight-acting"" people and their partners.   Bisexuality is a big tent and covers a lot of diverse people with a lot of diverse preferences. Saying that your preferences are the only true bi, pan, gay, or lesbian, is asshole behavior."

bisexual,3ax527,Lothrazar,11,Wed Jun 24 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do this. Personally I see it as a sort of ""convention"" because the definitions pansexual people tend to use for ""pansexual"" easily line up with the generally accepted definition for ""bisexual"" (that is, the inclusive term referring to attraction to multiple genders), and it's a term that has, in the past, been a major component of the so-called ""gay rights"" movement (hence LGBT!).   Whereas the definition for ""bisexual"" as an exclusive term is mostly new and tends to come from those that aren't bisexual/don't identify as bisexual, which makes me feel as though they're acting in an identity-policing manner, if not explicitly, then implicitly."
bisexual,3ax527,Steve_the_Scout,9,Wed Jun 24 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my stance on it and why I use bi instead of pan.  I have 0 issue with the label pan itself, but I don't think it is necessary to label yourself as it if you prefer bi. Bi is only an exclusive term if you, as a bi person, decide to define it as such for yourself."
bisexual,3ax527,wilenko,7,Wed Jun 24 09:20:15 2015 UTC,"I totally do. I'm not exactly sure why though....  Maybe because it's simpler somehow? Or a more commonly accepted term.

I'm pan but I call myself bi all of the time, and I think the reason I do it is because, imo, there are too many labels in regards to sexuality.

The ""pan"" prefix means ""all"" and I'm not attracted to all people.  I'm attracted to a very small subset of people - it's just that people's genitals aren't really a major factor to that attraction.  Note: I have no problem with the pansexual identity.  It's just the actual word that annoys me.  I'm the same way with the word ""organic"" to describe food - it's a stupid word for a reasonable idea."

I'm going to continue to exist, instead of using a different word to describe myself.  If I changed words that described me all the time, then the onus for change is on the wrong person. I shouldn't need to change my nametag to be accepted as an individual.  ... It should be noted that bisexual have also had a rough time due to people who decide to come out in stages, going from straight to ""bi"" to gay -- while it's a personal choice to do it that way, it's also disingenuous and damages my identity.  Using a new word like pansexual would let me sidestep this problem, but it won't help when the same trappings that come with the underlying concept start to catch up. No, I strongly recommend, in the face of challenge, to stand fast and face it head on -- particularly, when it's as straight-forward as saying I exist."
bisexual,3ax527,jinxjar,2,Wed Jun 24 12:05:47 2015 UTC,"Since I was 9 years old and understood what sexuality is (although had yet to fully have those feelings) I've identified with bisexual because the first definition I was given was ""two or more genders."" As I came to understand myself and found I'm not cis, I kept calling myself bisexual for two reasons. One, because people told me I had to be pansexual otherwise I was somehow transphobic (based on the long outdated idea that 'bi means only two' and other reasons never made clear enough) or that I'm faking being either bi or pan. The other is that I still resonate with the term. I feel it describes my sexuality because while I don't care about my partner's gender per se, I still do view that as a factor in my attraction to people.   I do understand your reasoning for using it with those unfamiliar with pansexuality, but you could always use that as a starting point to educate them on what it is to be pan by talking about bisexuality and how the two are related but separate."
bisexual,3ax527,purpleblossom,2,Wed Jun 24 08:43:20 2015 UTC,I'm def. closer to being pan rather than bi but I can hardly ever be bothered explaining what that means where as people understand bi so I tend to just stick with that.  Honestly it's closes enough that in most circumstances as to make no real difference.  Really though considering I've been in a relationship with another woman for 10 years most people just assume I'm a lesbian and sometimes for the sake of brevity I'll even just straight up tell people I am.

Outside of social justice communities, I only ever use the term 'bisexual'."

If 80% of the pan community refuses to identify as that except to people who already know what it means, then how will others learn? You shouldn't complain that people don't understand if you aren't willing to give them a starting point to learn from.  But, in terms of identity and the words you use to describe yourself, use whatever you want. If you identify more with a certain label then use it, just don't complain that you can't use a different one if you aren't willing to help solve whatever problem is keeping you from using it."

bisexual,3ax527,cbrachyrhynchos,2,Wed Jun 24 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"If calling a bisexual person in a homosexual relationship ""gay"" is 'bi erasure', as we very often see it called, then refusing to use the word you identify with because you don't want to ""deal with"" people having questions is similar to me on the level of erasure that's happening.  There's different levels of intensity, but that doesn't mean the smaller instances don't happen.  Also, I specified ""people who identify as pansexual but say bisexual to other people.""  If a person identifies as and calls themselves bisexual there's nothing happening.  It's the refusal to use the actual word you want to use that bothers me."
bisexual,3ax527,axel_val,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"A key difference there is that bi erasure is something that happens externally, often by institutions with billions of dollars of capital and through channels reaching audiences numbering in the millions. How we describe our own sexuality is another matter entirely. Equivocation between qualitatively different ideas is a case example of how the emerging pansexual movement is both ridiculous and anti-bisexual.  And of course, a problem on the table is that many people in this discussion identity as both, (or would if some advocates for pansexual didn't make a habit out of creating conflicts with our sexuality in superficial support of our gender.) Inconvenient, I know. But people are going to pick among alternate synonyms as a process of negotiation with attention to the audience's understanding. That's what language does."
bisexual,3ax527,cbrachyrhynchos,0,Wed Jun 24 22:39:45 2015 UTC,"bi erasure is something that happens externally   I guess I would disagree with that, because I consider it erasure when you hold back on your own identity, because you're preventing it from being known.  When a bi/pansexual person in a long-term relationship calls themselves straight or gay for ""simplicity's sake"" or something like that, I consider it a small form of erasure.  I disagree with most definitions that necessitate power to be a driving force behind what happens though.  Yeah, I totally get your second part though.  As someone who identifies as both genderneutral (majority of the time) and genderfluid I'm familiar with picking which of the two is the best for the situation.  But in my case they're both ""weird"" identities so no matter what I pick I have to explain myself and I don't feel like I've run into any brick walls with it, lol."

I hope this isn't offensive in any way, but as I see it, pansexuality is just a particular subset of bisexuality. Bisexuality is, in my opinion, synonymous with non-monosexuality, and it manifests itself in plenty of different ways. Pansexuality is probably the most common though there are others.   So what I'm saying is that I think pansexuality is just a division of bisexuality, so I use bisexual and try to make it clear that I am totally trans/non-binary inclusive in my attractions."

There are other people like me out there!"" The word ""bisexual"" has had a very special place in my heart ever since. I only heard the word ""pansexual"" for the first time a couple years ago and it's like, yeah, I fit the definition, but it doesn't have that same emotional resonance for me. And because the word ""bisexual"" is so special to me, I like the idea that by using it I can help reclaim it away from the baggage of negative stereotypes people sometimes attach to it. I've also known some people who identify as pan who are kind of snobby about it-- ""I love people regardless of gender."" It's like, cool, so do I, but it's not like that makes you better than people for whom gender does play a role in their attractions. Sheesh.

bisexual,3aw1of,ProblemPie,7,Wed Jun 24 01:11:43 2015 UTC,You might have dodged a bullet. I know I did one time. 16 year old boy I was head over heels for when I was 15 turned out to be a 38 year old man who had a record for kidnapping.
bisexual,3aw1of,Steve_the_Scout,3,Wed Jun 24 05:01:21 2015 UTC,Yeah no kidding. You never know with the damn internet. You're very lucky to have dodged a bullet!
bisexual,3aw1of,GWmaleCO,4,Wed Jun 24 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"I hade the same problem twice on POF or OKC. I caught on much quicker with the second one but it still sucked. I ended up deleting both accounts. I caught on with the second one by doing a Google search of her profile pictures which proved to have been taken from Google in the first place. If sent online, you can right click on the photo and click the Search Google for this Image option.  Doesn't work all the time but is pretty handy!"
bisexual,3aw1of,Envih,3,Wed Jun 24 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"This has happened to me too many times - and that's not even including the many, many more times when I picked up on it straight away. I'm married, open marriage, a mother and a teacher so being outright open isn't simple so internet dating was my main way to try and meet women. I got to the point where I was either talking to dudes pretending to be bi chicks, or demanding photo evidence of real time proof from genuine women but offending them because I didn't 'trust' them. I actually became so disheartened by the whole process I stopped looking. I'm still not over how the whole process made me feel and I wish it had gone another way but putting up with one year and only really meeting a handful of genuine women just got too stressful for me. I wish I could give you some really uplifting message about how it won't happen again. It never feels nicer but you definitely start getting better at picking the fakes.   Don't feel afraid to tell people you want some proof before discussing anything of a sexual nature - even if you explain you've been fooled before.   But don't give up - it was a bit harder for me in my circumstances - but if I was single without kids I would definitely have kept going to find a special someone."
bisexual,3aw1of,Envih,2,Wed Jun 24 07:23:37 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry to hear your reply! That's such a shame at how disheartening a lot of your experiences have been :( I hope that things pick up for you and take a turn for the better :)   From now on I won't have any hesitation on asking then to send a verification pic or vid.... Especially because I know it is just not that hard to do so if you're genuine and I would happily do it back.
bisexual,3aw1of,Envih,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:47:35 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, you're in the right place if you need to talk to folks that understand. I'm not a woman, so my experience with bisexuality might be different, but I'm always down to chat with somebody that needs to work things out. Otherwise, I know there are plenty of lovely ladies on the sub willing to help you out, most of which have probably been in your shoes before.  Chin up! At least you found out before any real damage could be done via personal information. We're all lied to every now and then."
bisexual,3aw1of,ToanDaxland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:28:32 2015 UTC,"OK, that's just messed up. I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but this is definitely the place to go for talking about this sort of thing. If you do want to talk one-on-one, I'm sure most people here wouldn't mind sharing their experiences truthfully.  If you do want to talk, I promise you that I'm an 18 year old bi guy in a similar sort of situation- not much same-sex experience at all, though I've been ""out"" for slightly under two years, and I'm still kind of in the process of adapting myself to it (and to be honest, I kind of want to talk to another bi person for once- everyone around me is either gay or straight)."

I do wonder the motivations of the other person. In the end they weren't fully honest with you, but there could be many reasons for sending you photoshopped pictures.  Sorry you feel betrayed. What sucks is that you will have a harder time opening up in the future. Just know there are good people out there, worth talking to."
bisexual,3aw1of,ToanDaxland,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:01:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you should prolly do the confirmation thing a little earlier on."
bisexual,3aw1of,ToanDaxland,2,Wed Jun 24 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in hindsight I definitely should have done so earlier, but stupidly I didn't even think about the fact that she was a fake. Didn't even cross my mind. Silly I know, won't happen again though that's for sure."
bisexual,3awt0j,parkavenueballerina,8,Wed Jun 24 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem in the past, at least for me, was that I felt like I'd ""drift"" between cultures and that there wasn't a bisexual space for me or people who recognized that as normal. When you say that you don't feel finished or final, it sounds like you might feel there's someplace you should be or something else you should be feeling.  These days, I find it fluctuates based on who I've been coming into contact with. If I'm around women I find attractive or I've been reading about women in fiction I feel a connection to, of course I'll be thinking about women--there's nice ones right here."
bisexual,3awt0j,snapdragonj,2,Wed Jun 24 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this sucks. We can chalk this up to living in a monosexist society. I accepted that I was bi when I was eight years old, and even now, some fifteen years later, I'll still catch myself in more of a girl-phase or boy-phase (my attractions can be fluid) and wonder, ""what if this doesn't pass and it turns out I'm actually gay?"" And then I have to mentally kick myself. I mean, sure, that's a possibility, but what's far more likely, because it's the only thing that's stayed constant in these last fifteen years, is that my sexuality is indeed going to fluctuate back to the middle. It always does, I'm always bisexual; and the only reason I have these sudden moments where I'll wonder if I'm becoming straight or gay is because that's the monosexist paradigm we're living in that has programmed us subconsciously to only see gay and straight as endpoints. It sucks. My advice is just do what I try to do, and when you have these feelings, remind yourself that it's society's monosexist programming rearing up. It's extremely tough to get past, and I definitely still struggle with it too some days, but I think the best thing you can do is be conscious of it and remind yourself the problem is not your bisexuality, it's how society trains us to think about sexuality. You and the way you feel are not the problem."
bisexual,3awt0j,light_sky,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"You don't have to ""choose"". In fact you can't choose to have different feelings. If you experience attraction to multiple genders, go ahead and call yourself bi. If that changes from time to time, no big deal, you're also fluid. And that is your sexuality. It's totally consistent and complete.   Why do you feel like you need to reach some final state? Sexuality is about who you are now, not years from now."
bisexual,3awt0j,aoeui-dhtns,3,Wed Jun 24 07:52:50 2015 UTC,"I get that, but what about committing to a partner long-term or for marriage? I am currently experiencing some major fluidity and I am engaged to a man. Does it not terrify anyone else to ""choose the wrong gender?"" People are about more than their gender but when your sexuality is truly fluid, it seems scary you may fall out of attraction with your partner based on gender."
bisexual,3awt0j,femmefolly,3,Wed Jun 24 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you for speaking up! This is a fear that I also have and have found when I discuss it with other bi individuals they write me off.   I've been dating an amazing woman for the past two years and we're always talking about marriage and kids and such. But for the past 5 or 6 months my fluidity has been tilted more towards men. I still love my gf and enjoy sex but have a yearning for a man. I find myself wondering if I'm a bad person at times though she reassures me I'm not.   Unfortunately, I don't have any answers, just showing solidarity."
bisexual,3awt0j,carolinaskye,2,Wed Jun 24 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"Well, that kind of thing does happen… but usually because the person's attraction was repressed and not identified before that married. You know you like multiple genders. Hmm. I think, if it has been a long time that you've felt this way, and you've been consistently fluid for years, then you'll probably be fluid for good, and any marriage partner is going to have to accept that about you. If it hasn't been that long, it's too soon to get married anyway, so it's OK not to know."
bisexual,3awt0j,aoeui-dhtns,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"I do, from time to time, but I feel like it's more that I'm surrounded by only straight and gay guys- when there's no one else around you like you, you feel the need to fit where you don't belong."
bisexual,3awt0j,Steve_the_Scout,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:58:43 2015 UTC,"Is the problem that you fluctuate between liking men and not liking men/liking women and not liking women, or is it just as you say that you fluctuate between liking women more and liking men more.   If it's the latter, I don't think you need to be worried about committing to a partner. You're committing to the person, not the gender. At any rate you should be open with your partner about this. Having someone at your side to support you can make this sort of thing a whole lot easier."

There.  This is quite literally an opportunity you're never going to get again, so take a deep breath, sit her down and ask her if she's seriously into you, etc. etc.  Sounds like there's a lot going on, so apart from offering an internet shoulder/ear to lean/talk at/to, I can really only say good luck, and try to work through all the issues with her. Try to tell her some of what you're feeling and hopefully it'll get easier the more you talk about it."

On the one hand, you may really want to go find out what it's like to be intimate with a man.  On the other hand, you may just feel nervous and be like ""what if I screw up?"" or ""what if I just don't like it?"" Again, I was thinking the exact same things.  I decided to get on Grindr and see if I could talk to some people.  I ended up meeting up with one of the guys I was chatting with IRL. I went over to his apartment, drank a few beers, and we talked for a while (I don't even remember what about right now tbh). About a week later I went over to his place again and we ended up in bed. You've just gotta find an opportunity, go for it, and just see what happens! Don't hold back, and good luck my friend."

I chatted with loads of guys on the net and eventually went to meet one. Went straight to his bedroom, sat on the bed, and got the fuck out of there as soon as he made a move. Didn't do anything else about it for four years and then tried again. Earlier this year i matched with a guy on Tinder, chatted with him a little bit and then we decided to meet up. I was freaking out but felt it was something I had to get over and done with. And that's what happened. It was great, and I enjoyed it as much as I hoped I would."

Be open about what you want and your experience in your profile.  I was in the same boat not too long ago and it worked for me.  There's craigslist but you'd need to be patient and have a lot of communication before meeting someone.  There's also a support forum if you want to talk about things like this.  http://www.shybi-guys.com/forum/. It's not for hookups but lots of guys there with the same situation.  Good luck!"

Listen to her, don't be judgmental or interrupt. When she is done, ask her any questions you may have. That is how you are going to get her honest expression of how she feels. Her honest feeling may include the words ""I'm not sure,"" or ""I don't know.""

You should get it looked at ASAP as it can get worse if you let it go on too long. It's relatively cheap to replace the cable (~$50-60) if that is the problem, especially if it is on the end that connects to the wall (~$5). It can be very costly to repair if the jack itself is the problem, as you may have to replace the motherboard, but I was lucky once and the repair guys were able to fix it by just welding something or other."

As well as him seeing that you are making an effort he will also see how you act without her around and then realise that being around her makes you uncomfortable. Even suggest not talking about her after the first 20 min of you guys hanging out, that way you get all the small talk out of the way then can chat about it her things. Make a daddy daughter evening once every month, or three months, or whatever so it's set in stone.

bisexual,3au1b2,MatticusVP,3,Tue Jun 23 15:01:29 2015 UTC,"I think you are bisexual & the fact that you are only capable now to be sexually attracted to women is caused by said trauma.  As such I think you generalise your experience to others-but I think it does not always apply.   I've also moved from identifying as bisexual to biromantic homosexual- and the homosexual trumps the biromantic on all fronts for me- because I do think I was always that way- it just took me time to figure out ""what was wrong""- and why I was unhappy in straight relationships.   Why? Because I am sexually gay- & as much as I'd want to act on my biromantic feelings- the physical side will never work out for me with a man. I want to be physically & romantically connected to my partner- and the physical side is the most romantic of all to me.   I've been in an asexual relationship with a man- and I simply cannot be happy that way. To me love matters-and precisely because it matters I cannot overlook the fact that for me despite being able to fall for beautiful souls regardless of their sex- I cannot connect to those souls physically if they happen to be in male bodies- rendering it kind of impossible for me to think of 'spending a life with a man'.   My homosexuality limits the  way I connect to people- as much as I'd like it to be otherwise- and hence I feel that the sexuality aspect is more important to finding the correct label.   I think if you are theoretically capable of full connection with both sexes- you are still bisexual, even if you don't want to date- be with men for other reasons, and if you are not attracted to them for reasons of past trauma."

I don't really know what you should do, but congratulations on accepting it and realizing that it's something you need to figure out. Don't let it drag you down like I have.

Bottom line: if you are really, truly comfortable being just friends with her, then this doesn't have to be a huge deal, and you don't need to feel any obligation to tell her. If it comes up at some point because she asks, you could say something like, ""Yeah, I've always thought you were attractive, but I know you're straight and respect that, and I'm OK just being friends, so I didn't see any reason to make a big deal out of it."" Presuming, of course, that such a statement would be true (I don't recommend lying about it). Is that useful?"
bisexual,3atc4n,TheQuietudeAbides,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is helpful. I think you made a good point when you said that if I'm okay being just friends with her (which I am), then it doesn't need to be made into a big deal or even brought up, because it's irrelevant unless she asks about it. Thanks!"

This might sound bad, but seeing guys actually having feelings was super weird at first. It was pretty eye opening dealing with the same shit with men as I always have with women.   There's a really ingrained myth that men are less emotional, learned pretty quick that that's not true."

But after a while, dating guys became much easier. In fact, dating guys changed the way I thought about dating and gender roles entirely. Which greatly improved my dating skills with any gender.   It gets easier, you just need practice."

I'm not even sure If I'm bisexual so no experience but basing on lurking around, I think that in same-sex dating the traditional strict gender roles/rules (often) fly out of the window and the couple is more likely to go by their own rules. So, take a deep breath, open your mind and be yourself ? D:  OH and communicate lol. Sorry I wasn't very helpful (I'm new to the sub as a suscriber) but I wish You good luck mister."

I always used to be like ""wow guys are so fucking clueless, girl's are NOT hard to read, etcetc"" but when I first started dating her, I was so damn clueless.  I never knew if I should pursue the more ""masculine role"" and ask her out first, or if I should wait for her to do it. I wasn't even picking up on her body language, whereas with men I could.  It kinda got messy because of the gender roles in my head and it was beginning to affect my relationship with her. Thankfully the awkwardness went away as we both got more comfortable with each other, and now we're doing great!  PS: Now I know girl's can be damn confusing as they say they are!!"

Ugh.

But once you do that and stop worrying about these gender roles, half the weight will be lifted off your shoulders.... which leaves room for you and your partner to be super close :)"
bisexual,3armyc,JackAndy,4,Wed Jun 24 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's super easy for me and way more natural than being with a woman (as a man). For one thing I don't have to censor myself so much and I can have fun how guys have fun. Also I don't have to worry so much about hurting a delicate little flower. I had this girlfriend once who I'd routinely elbow in the face in the kitchen because she was so short. Guys generally have a higher pain tolerance so I can play a bit more. I don't have to worry about grabbing them too hard if I hold their wrists behind their back or pull their hair for instance.  Besides that, most guys have a really hard time being as intimate emotionally as you can be with a woman. I have no problem with it but they tend to go caveman mode and go silent when they need to say something magic. They really just can't say how they feel and even if they do, they don't have the self-awareness to know why they feel it. I'm usually more self-aware than most women though. I guess most guys are just happy being like that. It does leave a hole in emotional intimacy for me though which is like the most important part."
bisexual,3armyc,PhasersOnMax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:25:50 2015 UTC,"I have only exclusively dated one bi guy for about 2.5 months.    The awkwardness for me was around sex.  Not the act itself, but general intimacy routine and expectations day-to-day.    With girls it generally followed one pattern type, but with him and I, at first the pattern and approach were not in sync for both of us based on how we handled it with girls."
bisexual,3armyc,Kasta_Fire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"21F  I totally get what youre saying about gender roles. I had always dated/slept with guys before my current relationship, and now with my girlfriend... It's like you have to completely renegotiate the  roles in the relationship. There isn't a manual. Based on looks and dress, she is a bit more feminine and I'm more butch, but she is more likely to pay on a date and I'm more likely to make a home cooked meal.   I think it's allowed me to think more about what I want to contribute to a relationship and what my skills are, instead of trying to fit an ideal that isn't me.  Best advice I can give you is to learn as much as you can, and then make your own rules."

I've heard it described as hetero-romantic but homosexual. It does cross over for me if I like the person enough.  I'm very happy with my current boyfriend.  The thing I have learned is not to overthink the labels. I really stressed out that maybe I was really a lesbian for a while, but I'm positive that my feelings for my SO are real and that's all that really matters to me."
bisexual,3arl4k,_turtle_duckling_,2,Tue Jun 23 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! It really helped hearing that last part. Im also positive my feelings for my SO are real. So even if I was 99% lesbian, if I have feelings for this man and love him/am attracted to him, it doesn't matter who I am attracted to outside of the relationship.  I also don't feel like Im missing out by not experimenting with women, so I think I will be fine.  We seem to have very similar experiences, thanks for sharing! :)"
bisexual,3arl4k,hella_elle,5,Sat Jun 27 21:24:01 2015 UTC,"I've recently learned that bi people can be biromantic and/or bisexual to one or both genders. It sounds like you are more inclined to initially be biromantic to men and bisexual to women (even though you are also sexually attracted to men as well).   To give an example, even though I am sexually attracted to both men and women (hence bisexual), I think I tend to see women more romantically and thus I think I am more biromantic towards women. Some bi people are of equal strengths of both views to both genders; some go through phases. We're all different and change is constant.   It's great that you found out a new part of yourself (or faced it, if you already knew)! I also found out that I am bi at a 'later' age (I found out last year at 25yo when I started dating my gf).   As for wanting to stay monogamous, I handle it the same way as when I'm dating anyone; it's fine to find other people attractive as long as you don't act on it (if your partner wants a monogamous relationship and the two of you have agreed on this). Even if I find other men/women attractive, I would never dream of cheating on my gf since we had agreed that we both prefer to be monogamous.   As for your last question: sexuality is fluid. You can decide to be whatever label or avoid the label altogether. I have a couple of close friends (both girls who are dating each other) who refuse to label themselves because they don't feel like ""lesbian"" or ""bi"" fits due to their personal views and histories. Some people may disagree and say that if you find both genders sexually attractive, it doesn't matter if you get fireworks with one gender and not the other, since attraction to both = bisexual. But you don't have to be labeled. A lot of people are more comfortable with the label ""gay"" or ""queer"" because it indicates that they are not strictly heterosexual, but is a big enough umbrella term to encompass many different types of sexual orientations. Ultimately, it's up to you."
bisexual,3arl4k,Kasta_Fire,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"What Im worried about is changing even more until I am just full fledged lesbian. I mean, can that happen 10 years into marriage? Do people really Change like that? I always knew I thought girls were pretty so I wouldn't say I changed, I just accepted what was already there. I don't want to lose my bf is what Im getting at... I love him. Will I one day wake up wishing he had a vagina?"
bisexual,3arl4k,tinteoj,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:40:55 2015 UTC,"Short answer is probably not, but maybe.  Longer answer:   Some elements are out of your control; people's sexuality can change over their lifetime.   Think about what factors you can influence, and work on those.   Is a naked female body the only thing that attracts you about girls or are you attracted to femininity? If the former, I suggest porn. If the later, maybe take a more dominant role in bed. Maybe your bf would be willing to role play with a bit of makeup or a dress?   Consider threesomes with another girl or swinging. Only if there is a lot of good communication and you are sure your boyfriend is totally okay with it. It could allow you to experiment within the boundaries of your relationship.  Consider that if you have a strong relationship, you might find other people attractive but you wouldn't want to hurt your partner by following through on those feelings. It's perfectly fine to feel sexually attracted to someone and do nothing about it.  Ive been with my girlfriend for a year, and sometimes I see a nice looking guy and think about a nice hard cock, but my relationship with my girlfriend is based on so much more than just physical attraction. She's the cutest, hottest, more beautiful thing ever, but that's not the only reason for the relationship.   Some people you might find hot as hell but never want to be with, some people might be average looking but be beautiful in your eyes because they have the right personality. It doesn't have to be a perfect personality, it just has to be the perfect personality for you.   Last thing, if you are having serious doubts, talk to your boyfriend honestly about what you are going through. It's only fair to warn him. And hopefully honest communication will bring the two of you closer together.  Good luck."
bisexual,3arl4k,happyhedonist,3,Fri Jun 26 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"I can't answer if it is normal for bi women (being a man), but that certainly sounds like the mirror image of me. My attractions to men and women are very different. With men, it is the ""sex"" that I'm attracted to. With women it is more the whole person. i definitely fall under ""bisexual-heteroromantic.""  But that takes WAY too long to say (or type), so I leave it ""bi."""
bisexual,3arl4k,hailtherens,2,Tue Jun 23 02:51:03 2015 UTC,"Bi guy here and totally in the same boat, although I get most of my arousal for men from looking at/imagining their genitals.   But I don't think of them in any sort of romantic way and kissing is still off the table. Which is a major difference between the two for me, because even with female FWB's I get a lot of my arousal from kissing them. I too worried for years that if I kept indulging my boy-boy urges one day I would ""wake up gay.""   But eventually I realized it was just a facet of my sexuality and became comfortable that my occasional lust for men did not negate my lust & feelings for women."

Thought I only liked women in a sexual way. Until I started seeing a women,  and it was a whole new story.  I fell for her and we have been to together for close to 2 years now.  My advice is if you get the option,  explore your feelings.  You never know what could happen."

I didn't have a name for my feelings for them, but with girls I had a whole scaffolding to work with.    Keep checking in with yourself.

Any sexual person can be monogamous or polygamous. Doesn't matter if you're lesbian, gay, straight, whatever.   I get what you're saying, because bi people have more of a ""choice"" and are into both sexes. If you fall for a man, and want to be monogamous, go for it. If you fall for a woman, and want to be monogamous, go for it. It's possible to be bi and monogamous.   I know a lot of people think being bi = free threesomes for err'body!"

bisexual,3apwws,MatticusVP,2,Mon Jun 22 16:27:34 2015 UTC,Reading this gives me hope.
bisexual,3apwws,MatticusVP,3,Mon Jun 22 17:34:17 2015 UTC,It can be done! There are a lot of open minded men and women out there!
bisexual,3apwws,ClickHereForBacardi,2,Mon Jun 22 17:35:47 2015 UTC,This p much sounds ideal. But how the hell do you meet bi swingers?
bisexual,3apwws,MatticusVP,3,Mon Jun 22 23:15:46 2015 UTC,"There are more than a few ways. There are a lot of websites for swinging couples to use when looking for other couples, kind of like any other dating site. Its easy to let people know that youre bi or looking for bi people. There are also swinger clubs, but its hard to tell if someone is bi without asking. Occasionally we use craigslist to find couples or single bi people."
bisexual,3apwws,bleppie,9,Mon Jun 22 23:17:52 2015 UTC,"From my experience the need to explore your sexuality will not go away. Suppressing it will cause it to transform into anger, depression, and resentment that will deeply affect your relationship. So even if you're a good couple, not exploring your sexuality will turn you into a bad couple. Again, my experience of course.  I doubt you want to hear this, but I think the earlier you explore, the better. Better now that in 10 years with a house, a few kids, and a pot belly. ;)"
bisexual,3apwws,nashife,15,Mon Jun 22 15:39:14 2015 UTC,"This has not been my experience. I think it really depends on the person, their personality, and age/hormones/etc.  I'm a bisexual woman in my 30s who has never had a relationship or even a fling beyond one or two drunk moments with another woman, and I'm in a committed (engaged, actually) monogamous relationship with a man.  I made a commitment to him, and although we've talked about the possibility of opening our relationship, it's unlikely that we will, and that's okay with me.  Our relationship is strong, and from my experience, it's completely possible to commit to someone and let go of any real desire to be with someone else. This is the same thing in any committed relationship. To say that bisexuals have some kind of biological need to be with both genders and to deny yourself the experience of being with both genders is bad actually feeds into the ""bisexuals can't commit/never be satisfied with you"" or ""bisexuals are promiscuous/untrustworthy"" stereotype.     Not exploring might be really detrimental to SOME people, but it's definitely not a universal thing."
bisexual,3apwws,bleppie,2,Mon Jun 22 16:44:54 2015 UTC,"Not exploring might be really detrimental to SOME people, but it's definitely not a universal thing.   Agreed, we're all different. I was responding to OPs tone and words, which feel familiar."
bisexual,3apwws,Annodyne,5,Mon Jun 22 19:18:43 2015 UTC,I do experience it just the way you descibe it. But how do you explore while in a relationship?  ....Hey honey I'm going to some guy to explore my sexuality  .... I guess things just don't go that way.
bisexual,3apwws,avapoet,5,Mon Jun 22 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"I wish I could help you with useful advice. My current BF is bi-curious and since I am bi myself, I am totally supportive of him wanting to say ""Hey honey I'm going to some guy to explore my sexuality..."" even if I am not involved, I want him to feel free to explore it, and I am not intimidated or threatened by the idea because... well, I don't have the equipment to satisfy him in that area.   I know what I do have, he values immensely, so I feel secure. I wish it could be the same for you. Best of luck..."

There's certainly nothing wrong with waiting - having a house, kids, even a pot belly is not detrimental to you living your life. The main thing is be honest - with yourself, and your partner(s).   I do agree with the whole suppression issue being damaging to any relationship you may be in/thinking of having. Also, in my experience, the urge to explore won't go away.  From a guy that waited until 40 before coming out, a guy who has 4 kids, and a little extra around the middle :)"

While I don't believe he would ever truly invite someone else into our bed, we sometimes fantasize about it together during sexy times. We talk about three ways with all sorts of other people...   Its helped me a lot, I went through a phase at about a year together where I was craving women and I was feeling like I was abandoning my bisexualness.   You can get through it, and you can remain faithful. But its a lot easier to do if you do it together."

bisexual,3apwws,LordCryoIII,2,Tue Jun 23 11:06:34 2015 UTC,"Again, you're going to have to talk to your partner about this. Maybe she'd be okay having an open relationship? It's difficult to give advice and I can only imagine how difficult it is for you having to deal with all this. But at the end of the day I think you're going to have to sit down with your partner and talk this through with her. Talk to her about what you want, both from experimenting with people and from your relationship with her. There's no point in being in a steady relationship if you're going to be unhappy in it."
bisexual,3apwws,TheLonelySamurai,2,Tue Jun 23 11:39:13 2015 UTC,"As many have said, it's possible you may be able to negotiate latitude for yourself to explore those curiosities and urges outside the relationship.  It's not cheating if you talk to her and she gives consent!"
bisexual,3apwws,LordCryoIII,2,Tue Jun 23 08:12:53 2015 UTC,"If you have good communication about your sex life, you could try asking her to take on a more masculine role in the bedroom from time to time. She could be more dominant, maybe even wear a strap-on. This might enable you to do some ""exploring"" within your existing relationship.   Or threesomes or swinging or an open relationship.  Just a reminder that this is something that she has to be very very okay with. It will be bad for your relationship if you (even inadvertently) pressure her into doing something or letting you do something that she doesn't really want.  If she says no to all of these suggestions, and you evaluate the pros and cons and decide that you need to know what sex with men is like, people be honest with her (aka don't cheat). Either she is not the one, or you are not ready for a relationship. Hopefully it won't come to that.   Best of luck."
bisexual,3apwws,LordCryoIII,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"Well funny you comment this now, yesterday we had a long chat about this. I don't think she will be fine with me exploring. But she did take a very masculine role in the bedroom two days ago. It was what I needed (offcourse I want other stuff) but this was something in the right direction!  And I don't know if it is a good descision to explore if possible. hat if I want more? I can't switch partners my whole life to fulfill my needs."
bisexual,3apwws,DjGhettoSteve,3,Fri Jun 26 09:45:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a Bi male and I am going through the exact same problem as I type this. I recently brought the subject up with my girlfriend of 2 and a half years and while she's supportive on the surface, she obviously doesn't like the idea of me experimenting with other guys.  You can't exactly blame yourself for wanting to experiment - it's natural. But you can't exactly blame your SO for being hesitant, because you are boinking another person. This is where the problem comes in, as I see it - no one's really right and there's no easy way to handle it.   So far we haven't really come up with a solution, and I'm quite worried about what this might do to our relationship because, trust me, that urge to explore won't go away.   So far we've agreed that I can do it, but she clearly doesn't want me to and has put all sorts of restrictions on it and what not. It's not really how you would want it to go, so I'm at a loss for what to do.  Just know that while I may not have any real answers for you, you're certainly not alone in this situation. If you and your girlfriend come up with anything, please update us!   Edit: I suggest you ignore the threesome advice, personally. If a girl is not willing to let you explore a natural side of your sexuality with a guy, I'm fairly certain her participating won't actually make it easier for her."

Dude, please do not perpetuate this stereotype. A girl is not ""insecure"" if she isn't into an open relationship.

bisexual,3apwws,ottawadeveloper,8,Mon Jun 22 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Experimenting through a threesome can cause some very hurt feelings. What happens if your SO feels like they didn't get enough attention during the exchange or you start having separate romantic feelings for the third you brought in.  If your SO isn't OK with you having feelings for other people, a 3way isn't going to change that. I've known so many folks who have tried this & every single one ended horribly."

bisexual,3aqvx6,lastcrown,12,Mon Jun 22 19:52:14 2015 UTC,"You've made a ton of legit criticisms (racism, biphobia) of the community, though IME the alternative look one is kind of ehhh. There are still more conventionally-dressed queer people than otherwise. Queer people just more commonly go for alternative looks.  And yeah, it's true that the community at large is kind of gross toward bi people. That hasn't been an issue with me, however, because pretty much none of my friends are straight and only a handful are gay. Most are bi or some other polysexual sexuality. So I'd suggest finding other bi people. We're waay more common than we seem and once you've got people you feel comfortable being yourself with, the world feels a lot less gross and awful."
bisexual,3aqvx6,WooglyOogly,3,Mon Jun 22 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"The alternative one comes from on outsiders views of queer spaces. Every queer space that I've seen from GSAs to Pride parades to Tumblr blogs seem to attract people who are more subversive.  Also there is no secret that Gay community is heavily divided across racial lines.   Most of my friends and family are straight and tend to be homophobic. They are also immigrants or the children of immigrants (Middle East, Caribbean, Latino, Indian, East Asian) I mean where do I go to find other 2nd generation Bi people?  They don't seem to be around or if they are they are afraid of the reaction from our communities so they stay in the closet.  Im lucky to live in one of the most multicultural cities in the world so I'm not going to give up but I'm becoming disillusioned with the whole thing."
bisexual,3aqvx6,WooglyOogly,2,Mon Jun 22 20:24:08 2015 UTC,I don't know. I live in a pretty rural area in south jersey and have had the same core group of friends since elementary and middle school. They've just all come out since high school. I met all my other friends through other friends and college clubs and stuff so I'd suggest checking out some of those.
bisexual,3aqvx6,kawAdamz,5,Mon Jun 22 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"I don't relate with most of the gay community either, but you don't HAVE to act any certain way just because you're bisexual. I think you are overthinking it too much. I know it's hard to deal with the transition into being an open bisexual (believe me), but, all you need to do is accept yourself, be confident, and be honest about your sexuality. Nobody will criticize you if you just own it, you know? They will respect you for being honest and will admire your courage for being different. I have never had any problems with discrimination since I came out as bisexual publicly (and I live in Texas), and I have learned to love the bisexual aspect of my being - it makes me who I am. It all just takes time, so try to pace yourself, and remember that being bisexual is about YOU and you only, not about the social aspects of the LBGT community."

bisexual,3aqvx6,Evil_Eyes,6,Mon Jun 22 21:07:14 2015 UTC,"You have pretty much nailed the average Bi-Persons experience I believe. I know what you mean.. I want to, but often don't enjoy gay bars/events. Everything is a bit over the top, there's a lot of Bi-phobia and there's always an unexpected amount of judgement. Like I said in a recent thread, a DJ shouted at me on the dancefloor for not looking looking Queer enough... I was just dressing as myself and was infuriated that there is some supposed queer standard I need to meet.. I'm always made to feel like a visitor in these situations..  Out of the other guys I have been with, its always the Bi-Guys I have been most comfortable with. In my experience they tend to be much more relaxed, normal(ish) and I know they are on the same wavelength and wont have funny or weird opinions of me. The problem is a lot of Bisexuals avoid gay/queer spaces because of the reasons we both mentioned, so they can be tricky to find. I would strongly recommend online dating if you wanted to find another Bisexual to date, I've always found a lot online! :)"

bisexual,3aqvx6,hindikoallama,2,Mon Jun 22 21:17:39 2015 UTC,The LGBT community is different in different areas. I get the impression that non white LGBT people are just quieter because they tend to face more discrimination then white people. But I am white so this is only a guess.  I do get the not feeling like you belong part though. We are not strait or gay and there is never groups for bisexual specifically.  I hid my bisexuality for a lot of years. It has caused me a lot of depression etc that I am still dealing with. Totally not worth it. If I could go back I would have come out much sooner. But thats me. Dont let your experience with the LGBT community stop you from being yourself. You don't have to be anything that feels wrong.
bisexual,3ar7p5,Seekingadvise,3,Mon Jun 22 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"That does seem like a not too uncommon experience. As a rule of thumb, if you come to /r/bisexual or one of the sister subs and as ""Am I normal?"" The answer is probably going to be 'yes'.  I think it happens when you stop punishing yourself with guilt and start rewarding yourself by indulging the fantasies. So your brain sort of blows out on this new thing, it can take awhile for your brain to normalise."

I started thinking i could be bi, and i sat on in a couple weeks to see if it was/wasn't just a quick fantasy. Well, it hasn't passed and I told my boyfriend about it (he was ecstatic) and ever since then it's like the lesbian radar has gone off! I went out last week and was hit on by 2 girlfriends looking for fun at one pub and then another girl at another!

bisexual,3ar7p5,ScorpionBite20,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:15:43 2015 UTC,I am very happy I spoke to my fiancée about it. I couldn't put my finger on it and it turned out I was feeling dishonest with her for not talking to her about stuff. When I did I brought it up in the most chill ax way possible - very matter fact. She did not judge and we will talk about it from time to time. She even knows I have a hue crush on a mutual friend - it's funny because she has a crush on the guy's girl as well.   I highly recommend you talk to your guy about it. He has people in his life that are gay and lesbian so you know he's accepting - he might even be more accepting than you think. I know it's a tough conversation to start and have but you will feel much better once it's done and it will even make your bond with him stronger.   Good luck!!! I'd love a follow up on it!
bisexual,3aqoqz,scarey421,6,Mon Jun 22 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"That's pretty silly to date someone for a year without ever making a sideways comment about an attractive female. Haha. I'm impressed. You never HAVE to talk about it. But you should feel free to be yourself around the person you love. It's liberating and fun to be able to comment on a girl's ass and have your partner size it up, too. Be aware that he might be interested in threeways/swinging when it comes up, and be sure you know where you stand on that. It can ruin your relationship or just make it really fun, depending on how well you two communicate and are compatible."
bisexual,3aqoqz,saydlin,4,Mon Jun 22 20:32:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that telling someone about your sexuality a year into the relationship does seem kind of silly. Like I said, I think I've just been avoiding the topic. It sucks having to explain your sexuality to the person you are with when that person might not understand it or might automatically assume that means you want a threesome. I get really sick of explaining to people that yes, I'm bisexual but no, I'm not into threesomes!  About the commenting on attractive women- I don't really ever comment on anyone I find attractive, especially in front of my BF. I understand that we're human and sometimes we're going to see other people that we find attractive and that's fine, but I honestly don't think that discussing the people we find attractive would be that fun for me!

In my experience, it's better to just not bring it up all at because most relationships will never get past that point where it might possibly matter. If it's been like 6 months, things are going well and they trust your judgement, this might be something to disclose and it could increase trust and intimacy. You don't need to wear it like a dysfunction though. They are fully aware that you are attracted to other people in the world and you aren't a penguin who mates for life. It doesn't really matter who you think is hot as long as you are faithful to them."

I have only been attracted to men and women in corresponding unaltered bodies. I think having two distinct terms with two meanings is useful.  Even if pan has historically been subsumed into the bi part of the movement, that doesn't mean it doesn't merit standing separate from that movement in the same alphabet soup alliance. 'T' and 'Q' were historically under the 'G&L' umbrella but are now rightfully seen as their own movements with their own definitions.  edit: Okay go ahead and downvote, but I'd appreciate any attempt at dialogue or addressing what I said. My comment is intended to both contribute to the conversation and point out that there still is a conversation to be had."
bisexual,3ampyc,epeen,6,Sun Jun 21 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone disagrees that there are bisexual people who are not pansexual. But that doesn't mean that pansexual people do not also fit under the larger bi* umbrella. Think of how trans* has become an umbrella term encompassing any and all genders that aren't cis (e.g., genderfluid, genderqueer, bigender, etc.). Umbrella terms can be helpful and just because they give a name to a broad category doesn't mean they're erasing the nuances of the different categories that fall under that umbrella."
bisexual,3ampyc,light_sky,2,Mon Jun 22 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is that most pansexual people do not consider themselves to be under the ""bi umbrella"". The idea that they do is one created by bisexual activists, not pansexual ones. It's like when gay people claim they don't need to mention bi people because it's implied."
bisexual,3ampyc,ihateirony,2,Mon Jun 22 07:01:28 2015 UTC,"Um…I'm not sure that that's true. I have known several people who identify as both pansexual and bisexual. (I myself am pansexual per its definition(s), but prefer to use the term ""bisexual"" as an identifier. So, there you go--I'm both.) If you accept Robyn Ochs' definition of bisexuality (""I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted – romantically and/or sexually – to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."") , then it's simply the case that yes, pansexuals do fit this definition, just in a different way than people who, for example, are not attracted to all genders/are not gender-blind/are only attracted to men and women. There are differences between pansexuality and being bisexual-but-not-pansexual, but there's certainly commonality as well in not being exclusively attracted to one gender. Would the pansexuals who don't consider themselves to be under the bi umbrella take issue with considering themselves along with bisexuals to be under the ""polysexual"" (i.e., not monosexual) umbrella? Is it just a matter of terminology? Because the way I define ""bisexual"" in the umbrella sense is equivalent to the way I define polysexual (aka not monosexual)."

(I myself am pansexual per its definition(s), but prefer to use the term ""bisexual"" as an identifier. So, there you go--I'm both.)    I know several people who identify as bisexual and pansexual, but they usually identify as bisexual first and only pansexual as an afterthought because they don't consider there to be a difference and prefer bisexual as a term. Which is certainly fair enough, but it is undeniable that there is a large contingent of pansexual-identified people (and I'd go as far to say that the majority) who very specifically do not identify as bisexual.   If you accept Robyn Ochs' definition of bisexuality (""I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the potential to be attracted – romantically and/or sexually – to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."") , then it's simply the case that yes, pansexuals do fit this definition, just in a different way than people who, for example, are not attracted to all genders/are not gender-blind/are only attracted to men and women.    And if you accept the typical pansexual discourse definition, bisexuality is binary. I do not accept either personally. I look at how people identify themselves and work from that. It's unfair, in my view, to tell people that they have to identify a certain way because another person defined a label and it could apply to their experiences.   Would the pansexuals who don't consider themselves to be under the bi umbrella take issue with considering themselves along with bisexuals to be under the ""polysexual"" (i.e., not monosexual) umbrella? Is it just a matter of terminology? Because the way I define ""bisexual"" in the umbrella sense is equivalent to the way I define polysexual (aka not monosexual).   You'd have to ask them, but given that their issue tends to be with the literal meaning of the prefix bi-, they'd probably be more okay with it. My key point is respecting people's identities though. A lot of people in our community use the bi umbrella idea and their definitions to conveniently ignore those that take issue with it, and personally I think a coalition solution would be better rather than absorbing them into us against their will.  As a side not, polysexual and non-monosexual are kinda different. Asexual isn't monosexual, but it's pretty clear it isn't polysexual either!"
bisexual,3ampyc,ihateirony,2,Mon Jun 22 11:58:51 2015 UTC,I guess the question is if their objection to being under the bisexual umbrella is predicated on imposing a definition of bisexual that the majority of bisexual people don't agree with then is their objection valid?
bisexual,3ampyc,Justice_Prince,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:14:41 2015 UTC,Their objection is valid because regardless of whether they have a right to decide on labels for other people they have a right to decide labels for themselves.
bisexual,3ampyc,ihateirony,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm torn. On the one hand, you're right that they should of course get to decide what the label means to them. But on the other hand, it can feel like pansexuals who are separatists are also imposing a label on bisexuals. By saying ""I don't want to be associated with that label because it's transphobic,"" it's saying bisexuals, by nature of using our preferred label, are transphobic."

(Pi-sexual, because enumerating gender, much less the genders I'm attracted to is irrational.) Most people are well aware of the idea that ""bi"" is less than ideal, although none of the alternatives stick out as being both politically neutral and easily understood.   The real conflict comes because people go beyond ""I prefer ..."" to ""... because bi is exclusive to binary or cisgender persons.""  And while there's always been a lot of problems for nonbinary people within LGB communities, erasing us from those communities for the sake of linguistic purity doesn't help us. We're here, we're (gender)queer, get over it."

bisexual,3ampyc,ihateirony,2,Tue Jun 23 11:27:09 2015 UTC,"My view regarding pansexuality is that not all rectangles are squares but all squares are rectangles. I identify as bi publicly (I dislike the term pan), but I am pansexual technically, and I think a large percentage of people who identify as bi are. I see it as more of a political difference than a biological one."
bisexual,3ampyc,Vatnos,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"I think they key thing to focus on is that there is a variety of interpretations. For some people your analogy is accurate, but for others (namely most people who identify as pansexual) it's comparing rectangles and pentagons. As such, I think it's important to respect that variety of viewpoints and not put one over the other by presenting it as fact as this infographic does."
bisexual,3ampyc,ihateirony,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:09:46 2015 UTC,"Typically the pansexuals who insist they're not bi are also the ones who most aggressively push to limit the scope of the bi label to the ends of the gender spectrum.

This is something we really should sort out because dividing and polarizing a community that's already small and invisible anyway is not doing any of us favors. I am curious, why pentagons rather than squares?  That intrigues me because I consider myself omnisexual, as well as pansexual, as well as bisexual. A square is also a rhombus and a parallelogram. I'm quite comfy saying bi most of the time. People know what it means and it is true, I am attracted to both the major sexes. I prefer the term also because I am politically bisexual, not just biologically. I care a great deal about breaking the stigma that forces many people to pick a side and limit themselves."

I'm not sure how to respond to this. Whether or not the loudest voices in a group are assholes or not is not a good reason in my mind to respect or disrespect the identities of those people. There are plenty of exclusively pansexual identified people who don't deserve to be trampled on because of those loud voices.   A limitation they frequently try to pass as fact, even though most of us didn't agree to it.   Aye, and the bisexual community are equally guilty as trying to pass their opinion on pansexuality as fact, even though most pansexual people disagree.   As far as different viewpoints go, we can't all be right. This is something we really should sort out because dividing and polarizing a community that's already small and invisible anyway is not doing any of us favors.   We can all be right if we talk in terms of labels that make sense for us and discourses that feel right for our experiences rather then objective facts. Coalitions are better than representing the views of one group anyway. I can explain in more detail if what I mean is unclear.   I am curious, why pentagons rather than squares?   Why blue instead of red? People have preferences. Variety is nice.   That intrigues me because I consider myself omnisexual, as well as pansexual, as well as bisexual.   That's pretty common. I feel the need to clarify that when I say pansexual people I mean those who primarily identify as such, rather than as an afterthought. I identify as bi and pan, but the latter is an afterthought, really.   I'm quite comfy saying bi most of the time. People know what it means and it is true, I am attracted to both the major sexes. I prefer the term also because I am politically bisexual, not just biologically. I care a great deal about breaking the stigma that forces many people to pick a side and limit themselves.   Aye, and some prefer to explicitly raise awareness of non-binary genders and sexes while doing all of the things that you do, and don't like the fact that bisexual as a label does not explicitly do this to the point that they don't want the label applied to them, which I think is fair enough."

I had a similar experience when I didn't realize I really truly was bi and non-monogamous until I was 36 and 5 years into my relationship with my husband. He, like your BF, accepted it, though there were some rough spots. Like you, I felt guilty of deceit. The truth is, we grow and change and evolve as we live our lives. It doesn't matter if we always knew deep down - the fact is we really DIDN'T know, until we knew (totes confusing, right?)  But it's ok. YOU'RE ok. You're a good person, and blessed for being able to be honest about who you are. Lots of people never realize who they really are their whole lives. If you feel your guilt and shame are interfering with your quality of life, I think a therapist could go a long way in helping you come to terms, even if it's only a few sessions. But this is normal, and with some work and self care, this too can pass."

I don't feel so bad that I think I need a therapist but I do think it would be good to spend some time writing and just being with myself. Because I've felt I've known for a long time, I haven't had any pressure to figure things out - if I've gone this long without exploring that side of me, I can go on indefinitely, right? That's how I thought for a long time. Now, I'm realizing if I want to have a full and open relationship with myself and partners, exploring that side of me is important. Thank you for your kind words, it is very much appreciated."
bisexual,3ao60o,TuskenCam,5,Mon Jun 22 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"Male here. Recently I told my wife I was bi. My decision to do this was pretty much guilt driven – I felt deceitful for never exposing my true self to her. Partly it was selfish as I didn’t want to die without being honest with at least one person. No desire to explore, I accepted monogamy before getting married. BUT against all of these desires to be honest was the guilt of depriving her of her husband, the ‘straight’ guy she had dated and then married. I felt awful for taking away that person…  But here is the thing, I didn’t take away anyone, I was there all along and part of what makes me the unique person that she loves comes from being bi: I’m open minded, very observant and empathetic, which I don’t think are solely bi exclusive traits but I feel go some way towards why I have attractions to everyone.  It took me a while to understand that after coming out and I had some severe regrets for a while…but time mellows it and ultimately I am pleased I took the plunge.   Anyway, this sums up to mean: don’t internalise that guilt, let it runs its course and then purge it. You have no reason to be guilty for being the way you were made.   Also, I just googled Ingrid Nilsen, daaaaaaaamn"

That's exactly how I felt!   My boyfriend and I started dating four years ago and although I've jokingly brought up dreams I've had where I left him for a woman, I've never really discussed my bisexuailty. I joked with him but I felt I couldn't tell him how I really felt or he would feel cheated or like I was not who he thought I was, etc. I love how you explained your journey and how you realized you weren't depriving your wife of anything - you were that person all along and she loved you for it without even knowing it. That is so true and such a big comfort to me. I explained it to my boyfriend like, 'it's a big deal for me to say but it really isn't a big deal' meaning I'm not going to leave you and I don't love you any less.   I think I just need to come to terms with it myself and let myself know it's okay. He is understanding and loving of me and now I have to be too.

(like i could have written this) It was also the Ingrid video who brought up these tucked up thoughts about my sexuality. I am so confused and anxious and have the same emotions you are having, in a way that it has shaken my whole world.  Being bisexual, is harder because its more options. the option of looking at a woman, a man, and its just all too confusing specially at the beginning. It is awesome that you have a good boyfriend that is supportive of what you are going through. it is completely understandable that you feel this emptiness, since so many people do not go through this process of understanding and finding their sexuality, so its more likely for us to feel more alone(at least thats how i see it). I have not felt the need to actually be with a woman to know that I am also attracted to them. i believe that even I am still in a bit of a denial, but bisexuality is also many times undermined.   I really wish you the best of luck in this journey, quite honestly i am pretty scared about what is next. I wake up with anxiety everyday thinking that the world i envisioned for myself is not the same anymore. It has really changed everything but you have a friend here if you need one to talk to, i sure need someone who understands me too."

I haven't had anxiety as an issue, just a general discomfort and some nervousness about who to tell. I understand what you mean about having more options, haha. I love my boyfriend but I also feel like I want to explore that other side of me, and sometimes I fantasize about girls and feel bad about it because I'm in a relationship. I think it is a journey of accepting it about yourself and realizing that it's okay and that we aren't screwed up or weird or bad. It's okay to be attracted to men and women and we are all perfectly imperfect. I'd love to talk more with you if you'd like, feel free to send me a private message.

As a guy, my experience of being bi is completely different, I would think, in that we tend to fetishize bi women and stigmatize men with any same-sex contact.  That said, I felt something akin to what you describe.  I still feel guilty and awkward around some of my guy friends who don't know and are probably too prejudiced to deal with it, and I've been out to myself for more than 20 years.    Are you afraid that your boyfriend is afraid he'll lose you to a woman?*  Using your mindfulness, can you dig at the root of your feeling and find what it is that you fear?    At the risk of sounding like I'm recruiting you, it's a short step from mindfulness to Stoicism, which I think would help you deal with this, whatever it stems from.    *this has actually happened to me, so I'm not making light of it"
bisexual,3ao60o,saydlin,2,Mon Jun 22 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you very much for your response. I think you are absolutely right that society tends to glorify and fantasize about bi women but bi men is like, 'ech, no.' I think it would be much harder to come out as a man. Saying that, because women being with women is seen as 'sexy' I feel it's hard to be taken seriously because they can't see you having a deep relationship. Everyone jokes, 'whoo, threesome' or 'women on women, that's hot' but they can't see it being more than that. I think there are issues with both and people will be people. I think guys do have it harder in the end and I can totally understand your discomfort around guy friends who may not get it. Saying that, you never truly know how people will react, and sometimes they surprise you.  My boyfriend is fairly quiet about how he truly feels and likes to work it out on his own. He might feel scared about losign me to a woman and he asked if he was going to be Ross Gellar'd (do you watch Friends?) and I said no, I wasn't going to leave him. I think it will take some adjusting but he seems okay.  I don't know what I'm afraid of. I just think it's scary because it's so new. And I have no way of familiarizing myself with it except time, acceptance and talking to people like you, who understand and appreciate it.

It is and always has been something useful only for behavior, and while it was awesome when there was nothing else, it has in the long term done more damage than good to the bi community because it sets up the false expectation that if you're more attracted to X you are by definition less attracted to Y.  Which is something people use to erase us all the time -- ""If you're not exactly 50/50 you're not really bi, you're just homoflexible/a tourist/lying.""  I am 100%/100%, not half anything."

It can't go bad, it can't go right, it can only make you feel right. You may like only fooling around with guys, but relationships only for the ladies. Who knows....life is too short.

bisexual,3anc0w,gossamercuttlefish,3,Sun Jun 21 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"There might be just a TOUCH of paralysis by analysis here. I’m certainly not here to define who you are. You are the only one that can do that. But you’ve listed a lot of external pressure. The LGBT prone restaurant, the drunken friend, all the porn and literature you immersed in. There’s nothing wrong with any of this, as it certainly rounds you out as a person.  But is it the subculture or the gender that allures you? Please don’t answer these questions to me, but just ask yourself:  Do you find men and women sexually attractive?  Not necessarily consistently all the time, or more/less heavily in one direction or another, but do you.  Maybe you didn’t “crush” on women before, but that could be socially induced repression. Are you closer to it now, that you’ve dropped some guard about it?  Your still young, you have plenty of time. What do YOU like? (Just don’t get married till you’ve ironed this out)  For me its easy, I am absolutely, positively turned on by men and women! But its taken me a while to get here. It wasn’t always easy. I identify as Bisexual because that’s the definition I relate to and am comfortable with. What are you comfortable with? You may be comfortable with something else tomorrow, and ya know what?

bisexual,3anc0w,typeBpositive,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Okay you sound way too much like me. I'm also the type to overanalyze, so I know what that's like. I'm also 20 yrs old, I'm a cis male and have only realized my queerness/bisexuality in the last year.   I was taken off guard, and said yes, but I felt very strongly like I was lying.   One of the most important moments in me realizing I'm queer was when a friend of mine directly asked me if I was straight, and I said yes, and immediately felt like I was lying. I hadn't even fully recognized my attraction to men by that point, but that made me think a lot about it.   I feel like I'm constantly overanalyzing myself because I worry that I'm wrong, and that I'm not genuinely into girls, at least enough for it to count... But at the same time, I feel so driven to understand myself.  I'm super worried that I've somehow tricked myself into thinking I'm attracted to women, and that I'm really not, and now I've lied to others and to myself.   I have felt very similarly, and this was a huge thing I've struggled with. I think it's important to remember the massive gravity of heteronormativity. Your attraction to men is given a platform, and your attraction to women is repressed by society. In this society, it'd be near impossible to imagine same-gender attraction. I have often felt like I've tricked myself into thinking I like men, but remember that these desires are going against the grain of everything you've been socialized to think, so it's natural that you'll question their legitimacy.  I hope I said something helpful; feel free to message me if you need to talk more things out, I'm in a similar place as you and I know that figuring this stuff out can be painful"

That's a commendable sentiment, but I think you'll find that you don't work like that.  I think of it like this:  I'm bisexual, which means that I'm open to sex with either gender, but every man and woman I meet are unique, which means at times I feel either more straight or more gay depending on what's on the menu.  It's as if the presence of human beauty selectively and variously illuminates different parts of myself that were always there.    Now, bisexuals are a very diverse bunch, so I'm not telling you how to be bi.  I just hope my experiences can prepare you for what comes next."

If you did in fact say something that you later decide isn't accurate, believe me, you're far from alone.  And you know what?  There's nothing wrong with questioning.  If it turns out that you do in fact identify as straight, and your friends can't be understanding, you may need some different friends.  In the meantime, relax.

The first time I thought about my sexuality really deeply was when I was 15 and I think at first it was just because I wanted to be different than everyone else, so I wanted to think I liked girls as well as guys, but then I realized ""Oh? Wait...that girl is really hot... Whoa that guy is hot too..."" and found out that I wasn't just doing it because I wanted to be different. I came out that year and I'm happy about it, really happy. I'm turning 19 this year and never looked back!  Honestly darling, you just need to think about who you are and if that happens to be bisexual, awesome! If you happen to realize you're not, that's okay too because everyone is amazing in their own ways and being on the LGBT spectrum doesn't make you any more awesome than you probably already are :)  Have fun with your self discovery, I know I did!"

When you're around someone you find attractive your body will let you know and it will feel right. If bisexual fits with that, cool. If not, well then you learned something about yourself and get to be more sure of how you conceptualize your sexuality. If you're friends don't believe you they aren't really very good friends. You may also be low on the Kinsey Scale like me. I see myself as a 2 or pansexual. It was hard for me to pin down how I felt for a long time because of that. These things take time to figure out.  You're going to be fine whether bi works for you or not. Maybe try reaching out to a local LGBTQ group in your city and talk to some people in person?  Good luck!"

It uses a scale from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. In both the Male and Female volumes of the Kinsey Reports, an additional grade, listed as ""X"", was used to mean ""no socio-sexual contacts or reactions""; in modern times, this represents asexuality.   The reports were first published in Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953).

You can talk to them, but ultimately they're gonna think what they're gonna think. You can't condition them to be accepting. They have to make that personal leap themselves, preferably before you come out to them.   Now, knowing a bi person can help people make that leap faster, but in the meantime they'd be rejecting you. So it's an option to be out to them anyway, but you don't have to be their teacher. This sometimes happens anyway because you usually come out to a group at a time, and some people accept you and some don't.   I think you should probe to see how accepting they are in general. And it's OK to just be in the closet for as long as you need to. Going to college and finding new friends can be a great way to get in the right environment to be out."

bisexual,3ajw9z,Stjem05,3,Sat Jun 20 22:35:26 2015 UTC,Maybe you get turned on when you see naked women because you're an exhibitionist and you identify with them. Maybe the thought that it could be you with the big boobs exposing yourself is what is turning you on. Women are sexualized so much in our society that it can be confusing.  On the other hand while I am attracted to men I don't necessarily like or want to touch their genitals. I like what they do to me so I do touch them but it's not out of desire. I like their arms and abs and hands (men that is).
bisexual,3ajw9z,Girlshaveneeds,2,Sat Jun 20 23:14:01 2015 UTC,Hmmm actually I think you may be on to something!  I often thought when I looked at woman that the idea of Being them was what was actually turning me on. Almost like i was in their body and showing it off that was turning me on.  Regardless the more I think of it the more I think I am turned on by men as well. Going off of birth control last week I noticed my desire toward men has increased. I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds their genitals to be hot in and of themselves. I honestly thought that was making me gay.

bisexual,3ajw9z,rdv_chio,2,Sun Jun 21 03:16:18 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of detailed feelings about men and women, and that is your sexuality. Nobody feels exactly the same. You sound bi to me, but every label has some round-off error."
bisexual,3ajw9z,doombybbr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"If I had doubts like that about my sexual orientation I would not think of getting married yet. There's no need to rush it, and things get much more complicated once you are married. Slow down, find out what you like, talk to your boyfriend and go from there. Marrying a year later did not kill anybody.  I also recommend reading some posts over at /r/actuallesbians, in case some of their stories ring a bell, although also keeping in mind there will be an inherent bias towards experiences of women who eventually realized they were lesbians."
bisexual,3ai8ld,S3V9,29,Sat Jun 20 12:51:20 2015 UTC,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I would recommend not talking about it for a while. Or dwelling on it. Just let it seep in with your family, let them understand you are the same person, and then when the time is right and YOU feel better about the situation, begin to integrate it into your actual life. I'm NOT saying hide who you are. I'm just saying to let yourself and your family digest this."
bisexual,3ai8ld,barelyonhere,23,Sat Jun 20 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"I would live in the present - think about the reason you came out, and focus on that. Also, don't worry about what will come or what you percieve as happening... try and breath, and stay with the now."
bisexual,3ai8ld,Artfullyours,11,Sat Jun 20 12:56:44 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on coming out. You've done something at such a young age that took many people 10 to 30 years to do.   Remember the courage it took to tell everyone?  Well you've still got in you. The hard part is over, there is nothing left to do but let people process everything. You are going to be fine. You've got an exciting bi life in front of you now."
bisexual,3ai8ld,jchaosrs,5,Sat Jun 20 14:11:45 2015 UTC,"I was sort of in your situation a couple of months ago. When I came out I felt out of sorts for about a week. After that, everything sort of fell back into place. Think about what is happening in reality, don't overthink what is happening, it will be different in the morning. Do something to get it off your mind if you can and sleep once you can. Hopefully everything turns out okay for you!"
bisexual,3ai8ld,Definetelynottom,3,Sat Jun 20 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"I can't blame you for being nervous- just relax. When I came out to some of the people around me, they just needed a little time to process it, and after they had a chance to sit and think and sleep on it, they became super supportive."
bisexual,3ai8ld,bunnylover726,3,Sat Jun 20 13:04:59 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree with the other comments. Try to relax. People need time to understand things that they aren't used to (as stupid as that sounds). My best friend is the most understanding and non judgemental person I know and even he reacted 'badly' or 'stupid' when I first came out to him. He then apologized saying I just caught him off guard and he is so sorry. Just imagine someone telling you something you werent expecting. Even if you were completely fine with it your initial reaction might differ from what you really feel just because of shock etc. :) Give it time. Everything might turn out just fine :) And even if it doesn't, you are you and that is completely and utterly fine! No matter what other people think!"

Especially if this was something you've had your mind on/been building up to for awhile, there's naturally going to be a bit of snapback, a lot of pent up extra energy. I think you'll feel better in a couple days. Sleep is always good. :)"

I cried for about a week because I felt like everything had shifted and would never be the same again. That I'd made this irreversible change to the way people saw me and I could never go back.  Now I look back on all that anguish with a kind of 'aww, d'oh!' feeling, because within about two weeks everything was absolutely fine. I'm not really overt with my sexuality and I think my mum will always grapple with it, hard as she tries to be cool. But coming out was the best thing I've ever done. I only wish I'd been as brave as you have and done it at 15! (I was 23).  Don't fret, it'll all go back to normal soon. You are still just you and your parents will see that soon enough, if not already."

bisexual,3ai8ld,ScorpionBite20,2,Sun Jun 21 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"congrats on coming out fully first off! Secondly I think you shouldn't worry yourself with the negatives of you coming out. You did yourself a favor by saying this is who you are; focus on the positives and hopefully you should be okay afterwards. It could just be the shock of it all, which should go away! Best of luck to you"

bisexual,3ajc67,MrWoofles,2,Sat Jun 20 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"I never understood the draw of coming out as a big show. I'm usually of the mindset, I'll mention it if it comes up or someone tries to set me up on a date. Otherwise I don't think my friends care much about my orientation."
bisexual,3ajc67,amethyst_specter,3,Sat Jun 20 20:58:56 2015 UTC,My best guess is that coming out became a big deal in the time when it was extremely not acceptable to be LGBT+ to society. Aside from places like the bible belt I think it's just a vestigial association that coming out = big ordeal. That's just my guess though.
bisexual,3ajc67,Yopro,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"When I came out, I had quite a few one on one conversations, made a big show about it and felt the need to tell everybody. It wasn't about the attention for me, but more about insecurity. I felt the need to be validated so I waited to hear from the people I cared about that they were cool with it.   Now that I'm a little older, and more comfortable with the situation, I think being subtle is probably the best way to go. I think many people are more comfortable with the idea of bisexuality if it's explained in terms of ""Yeah I guess I'm just attracted to people rather than genders"" as opposed to a label thing.   Of course, if you're comfortable and want the whole world to know, don't be afraid to shout it out."
bisexual,3ajc67,volcano_bake_meat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, and everything that you mentioned is pretty much what I do now. I don't really tell anyone, unless they ask. People can just assume what they want to assume, which works for me."

bisexual,3aiih9,whateverhemmo,6,Sat Jun 20 14:49:49 2015 UTC,"You probably talk about being attracted to guys all the time, right? Like you and friends are talking about movies and someone mentions Chris Pratt and then you all agree how hot he is. It's a common conversation. Well, just start to include ladies into this conversation. The key here is to say it like it is completely normal,  and everyone already knows you like ladies. People will figure it out and bolder people will just straight up ask you which starts a dialogue.   This is how I did/do it and it has worked well for me."

I'm bisexual.""), or an announcement-except-not (""have I ever told you I'm bisexual?"") or just mention it in passing and let them pick it up (""Oh yeah, so-and-so is so cute, she was my first girl crush"").

bisexual,3aiih9,chloetee,2,Sat Jun 20 19:45:52 2015 UTC,this is actually my first post on here awkward smile - im a 17 year old female and im going through much the same thing - I've never felt the need to scream it from the rooftops to everyone but the few friends i have told have been super supportive. The first person i told was my best male friend who is also bisexual after he broke down about a homophobic comment made by another person from our college i found having such a frank conversation about my sexuality at a time where i was very confused so helpful. As for my other friends i just found myself commenting to them 'legit ruby rose is so hot' and im pretty sure they have gotten the message. At the end of the day my sexuality is my issue not everyone elses so im just waiting to go to university and explore then :)
bisexual,3aiih9,bluegreenwookie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"Well for me I had some discussions with some friends when i was struggling with my identity, so when I realized I was Bi, I told them first.  At first when I told my other friends it was less casual. It's something I feel really awkward about so I was sort of forcing myself to tell them in an attempt to feel more comfortable with being Bi.  Once that happened I stopped telling people deliberately and when someone asked ""what's new?"" I told them ""Not much. Realized I was Bi about  2 weeks ago"" which made me happy when one of my friends responded with nodding and saying ""makes sense"". Felt like validation which is something I needed.  You could try wearing one of those wrist bands with the bisexual colors on it. Might be a way for them to bring it up. Or if you are just hanging out with your friends and you see a cute girl comment about it and they might put 2 and 2 together.  One thing a friend of mine did, about 3 years after she came out was make a facebook post.  It wasn't even a long statement.  ""BTW I'm a lesbian""  That was it."
bisexual,3aiih9,Chmis,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you want to come out, but what I've been doing is making off the cuff remarks that allowed me to judge people's attitudes towards LGBT and encouraging the discussion. I've mostly used same sex marriage legislations as a topic to talk about and, was the person reacting well, moved on to my personal opinions about it and finally, why I really cared. Maybe this won't get you to come out to a lot of people, but also gives you an option to back off if you don't feel confident enough."
bisexual,3aiih9,ToanDaxland,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:04:32 2015 UTC,"For me, being a bi guy slightly older than you are: 1) When my [F]riend was checking out guys: ""Eh, you can keep him. He's not that cute. He dresses poorly, doesn't care about himself, whatever."" 2) [Ranting about getting rejected/heartbroken because of assholes] ""Yea they just blocked me for no reason one morning. Mhmm.. Yea. It's pretty dumb. He's just an asshole I guess?""  Those are the main ones I can think of off the top of my head. Usually people know (or somehow find out) about my long list of ex-girlfriends, so when I tell them that I also like guys, they usually make the connection. If they're particularly thick but not homophobic in the slightest, I'll fill them in:  ""Uh, full disclosure, I'm bi. [Continues with rest of sentence].""  Had one friend assume that I was typo-ing ""he"" when I really meant ""she"". Multiple times. In text.  Then I corrected her and she told me that she didn't think I had the courage to be bi. Whatever that means. Which was amusing and maybe if I misjudged her intent, I'd be offended."
bisexual,3aiih9,Mule1069,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"23/M here. I just came out recently and I too didn't want to make a big announcement about who I was attracted to. It's not that I was hiding who I was, but because I frankly don't think it's everyone's business what parts I enjoy playing around with. The idea of announcing to everyone that I enjoyed guys and gals gave me a little bit of anxiety. Who do I tell? When do I tell them? How do I tell them? How will they react? The idea of sitting someone down and telling them my sexual preferences just seemed like awkward conversation. I wouldn't sit people down to inform them of some of the kinkier things I'm into, so why was I obligated to inform them of this?  I decided the best way (for me) to come out was to not hide it anymore. I would say what I wanted to say and do what I wanted to do. I don't treat it like a secret, if anyone asks, I tell them, but I don't announce it to everyone I meet or even inform people close to me. People that I'm close to found out sooner or later, and some people I'm not close to found out as well, and that's okay. I'd say it took away a lot of the stress of the situation.  It has worked out pretty well for me so far, but by no means is this the best way for everyone. Everyone is different and so is the situations surrounding everyone. You just need to take some time to think about the best way for you to come out."
bisexual,3aiih9,ludicrouslyidiotic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"Well, this would probably work only if you're single, but if it comes up you can say something along the lines of ""nah, I don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend atm"" or ""when I get a girlfriend or boyfriend"" etc. Just casually specify more than one gender if it ever comes up."

Lots of bi people are attracted to different genders in different ways and to different degrees. As far as finding out that you're a lesbian when you're 50… well, who knows what will happen in thirty years? Sexuality can definitely be fluid, and we as humans are always changing and surprising ourselves, so really, who knows; but the point is, you can't possibly know how your desires might evolve (or not), so all you can do is focus on who you are and what you like right now. Right now you sound bisexual to me."

Finding out is only scary if you've been repressing it and you feel like you've missed out. If you accept that you are attracted to many types of people and you just go with that, whatever you call yourself, you won't miss out. You can call yourself bisexual, lesbian, or anything you like that you think suits you, but it doesn't have to be limiting. If you call yourself a lesbian and one day you hit it off with a male, we'll that's OK, you don't have to refuse dating him just because of that label.  Labels like lesbian or bisexual are convenient to quickly summarize your sexuality for others, but they can be limiting when it comes to yourself. There is probably no precise word for your exact range of attraction, so you can pick whichever is convenient for you. Just remember that what you call yourself for others isn't a contract that binds you. There are many labels but they can't possibly cover the infinite range of what sexuality is. That's OK -  you can be a lesbian or a bisexual, but what matters the most is that you don't forget to be yourself."

Asian guys, tall lanky guys, guys with glasses (gotta represent, even if two guys with glasses can sometimes be hilariously awkward when kissing :P). Yaoi and gay porn is awesome too.  To be honest, it sounds like maybe you're into men more sexually, and women more...physically? I'm not sure if I'm reading things right, but it sounds like perhaps you're into guys as sexual beings, and have more aesthetic appreciation for girls? You mention not really having sexual thoughts about them."

You are not going to get with the perfect guy the first time. And even if you did, the perfect guy would give you imperfect sex.   Sex is playtime. It's no place for perfectionism.

bisexual,3ah580,typicaldrummer,8,Sat Jun 20 03:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people are ""heteroromantic bisexual"" or whatever you want to call it. Basically, sexual attraction to anyone, romantic attraction to only one gender. It's pretty common on this sub. There's probably three or four posts on the first page of people describing the exact same situation. So yeah, you're not alone, and that is absolutely a real thing.  Next, yes, you're a teenager, and probably more horny now than you will ever be again in your life. These feelings might go away later. Or they might not. There isn't really any way to know, and there's nothing you can do to push it either way either.  Oh, and for the whole ""Crush on a friend, open relationship but not with this one person because you might develop feelings"" thing, welp, unless you, your SO and your friend want to give polyamory a try, you're kind of out of luck. Either accept it and move on or break up with the guy. Neither are great options, but there you go."

bisexual,3ah580,hyzenthlay1701,4,Sat Jun 20 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"That's great that you and your boyfriend are willing to work together on this.  Above all, communication and mutual respect are critical.  I definitely would not consider experimenting with someone that he doesn't approve of.  You both have a right to have your sexual and emotional needs met, so either you're going to have to find a solution that works for both of you...or you may have to consider that you're not compatible.  But do it right and do it honestly.  I see a few themes in your post, but only you can untangle which ones are most important to you: do you want to have sex with a woman, do you want to have sex with your best friend, or do you simply want to prove to yourself that you're really bi?  There's absolutely NOTHING wrong with any of those options, but how you proceed will depend on which ones are most important to you.  If you just want to know what it feels like to be with a woman and your boyfriend is open to it, there's no rush!  If you just want 'proof'...hm, do you really need proof?  It's hard feeling comfortable claiming to be bi without the experience (I know), but no one questions it when a straight person claims they're straight before their first experience; you have the same right.  And if it's your best friend you want, maybe you're wired for polyamory!  That'll be a harder one to deal with in your current relationship, but the more you know about yourself, the better off you'll be.  There's no rush to prove or experience everything right now, and everyone's different.  Take your time and find what makes you happy, then run with it :)"

But my political point is this: either way--no matter who is guilty or innocent--rainbow shit all over the house is a punishment for no one. Public shaming of an innocent person who is trying to help the LGBT cause is bad for everyone except bigots.   And besides, historically, reddit doesn't have the best track record on finding the guilt or innocence of people.  Outside that, I don't really care. I don't have skin in the game--I'm not even on the same continent. I didn't give any money, nor did I nor will I plan to. I get that there is perhaps more reason to doubt than what I first knew before opening this thread, but that doesn't mean I want to start going further down this rabbit hole.

Try not to beat yourself up over it. No one got hurt, no one did anything wrong or immoral. You just had fun with another consenting adult. Not a problem. Any shame you feel is just a result of society's homophobia and sex shaming, so don't worry about it too much.   If you think you need more of a connection with someone, then try dating. If you decide to do it this way again, then just stay safe.   Some people can do casual sex, some can't. You've gotta figure it out for yourself."

Having said that, this kind of sounds bad but I have a history of casual sex with women so I probably shouldn't rip myself up over it.   I guess its more of a bewilderment that I actually went through with it, as well as knowledge of the much higher risk of that behaviour with men that puts me on edge, but you're right no one got hurt and I shouldn't be too concerned since I was safe about it."

I do watch gay porn... More than I would like to admit. But I don't think I would repeat what I did, at least that way. It just seems too risky.   Either way, it happened I guess and now I just need to make sense of it all.   Maybe I'm putting too much thought into this."

You are feeling sleazy... Etc because you are facing an emotional dilemma, Trying to understand why you have had these urges, and most likely at the same time getting angry that you are having these feelings..  Hooking up with strangers is not the best way to go about this, as each time you do those emotions you are having now will plague you, along with the stress of were they safe or not!  Rule number one, always ask of they have anything, do not expect anyone to tell you upfront, ask, and if you still don't feel certain say NO!  You really need to identify and ask your self why you are experimenting with guys, and come to terms that it's ok, many guys experiment and learn that they are straight after all.   You don't need to tell anyone, I remember I had this great fear that my life was going to get turned upside down if anyone found out at the time, because I denied and repressed these thoughts for so long and blamed anytime I gave in and explored those thoughts on alcohol, I became emotionally unstable..(drinking drugs, sleeping with as many women as I could) My current girlfriend has helped learn to accept who I am, and have never been stronger.

In other words, bisexual is a range of feelings and attractions, more than a single option. Then there is your personal definition of bisexuality. So apparently you are a bisexual who has sexual attractions to both men and women but only romantic attraction to men. As others have said, you could call that heteroromantic and bisexual."

I can count the number of times I've been attracted to a woman I know in real life on one hand. Part of me think it might just be that because I was ""straight"" I put on blinders and wouldn't let myself see women in that way until there was one who took my breath away.  I tend to find more women attractive now that I'm open to myself about being bisexual.

I am mostly heterosexual but panromantic, meaning I'm mainly sexually attracted to women, but would date someone anywhere on the gender spectrum. For all intents and purposes though I just call myself pansexual, because if it's the right guy and we are close emotionally I can be physically attracted as well, also don't want to rule out intersex and genderqueer individuals.   If we want to get even deeper into the tumblr-y technical sides, I could say I'm gynephilic (and you would say androphilic), which basically means attracted to femininity, but one, that makes it sounds like I am obsessed/only attracted to vaginas, but I am attracted to pre-OP trans women just as much, and two, I'm not only attracted to feminine acting or appearing women...   I think I was supposed to help you by typing this comment but it ended up just making me more confused. This is why I don't like to dwell on it too too much and put labels on everything.

I had a skrink friend of mine explain it in terms, that 1, is a straight person who could not....under any circumstance have sex with a same sex partner.   Then to the 100 end of the spectrum, is the gay person who could not under any circumstance have sex with the opposite sex.    That being a willing and active partner.  That is willingly and without being drugged into submission.  So everyone else floats in and around from 25-75.  That is not locked in.  Myself I am only attracted to a very narrow band of same sex partners. The older I get the less likely said partner will appear and be willing.  As for opposite sex, the partner is an absolute opposite of the same sex partner in looks, color of hair and eyes. (Men are attracted to visual cues).  We as humans have a complex emotional state.  Which no one understands and no where at any time is it locked in permanently.  Our emotional needs fluctuate.   Based upon our person during a said point in time.  One week you might not be very threatened by your friends relationships, then something will set off those 'crazy feelings' for whatever reason.  That is being human.  But once you become aware of how you might begin to sense those emotions surfacing, you are better equipped to deal with them.  Cope with the feelings bubbling up and able to step away without harming your friendships.  Do NOT destroy your relationships by thinking they would appreciate your advances or your needs without being very very clear that they will not reject you and ask you to leave.  Thusly you just  fucked up.   There is a guy at one of the contractors I have worked with in building my home. He's a cute kid. He fits my narrow band of attraction.  The odds of anything at anytime going further than what I am thinking?  The same odds of winning the PowerBall Lotto. Or worse.    What do I do?  Chuckle to myself. Telling myself if I was 20 again I could probably take it to a different level.  So what does he do?  He came up to me the other day and said...  ""I want you to be my dad. I never had a dad. Mine left when I was a kid....I hear you have a new boat....""  Then he drops it.  ""My wife and young son would love to learn to ski...""  then he said, ""I think your wife is a pretty woman who could help my wife be a good mom...""  (innocent?) (his instincts working?)  We will never know because I will not take that next step.   What sort of day do you think I had that afternoon? So I keep it on the QT and within my head ONLY.  I can dream I can ponder I can think what if, but I can also ruin his marriage, my marriage and blow my relationship with the contractor who is a great guy that  depends upon me way too much."

I eventually just went with a random hookup as my first bi experience but it served as a great gateway to dare for more. So my tip is to go outside the comfort zone of ""someone you know"" and you might get more comfortable. I am currently dating another guy but felt the same way you are less than a year ago. Just be true to yourself and go for it mate.:)  Edit: grindr was my entry point"

Some of them are meant for us to learn from, so that we can move forward and have better relationships.   It sounds like youve already kind of messed this one up, with the cheating. If youre questioning whether you want to continue this relationship or not then its likely that your heart is no longer in it.   If youre afraid of leaving her beucause you might not find someone who is open minded you should stop that right now. There are a lot of open minded people out there. All youre doing is holding yourself back from finding them by staying in this relationship. You are young, and you should have fun while you can. When the right person comes along you'll know it.  Im not one to usually suggest break ups, but it seems like the best option for the both of you to move on."

I feel guilty about it, everytime I look at her I remember what I did and it hurts cause she's a really good person and I know she'd never do this to me.

bisexual,3abyog,hales011,3,Fri Jun 19 00:58:37 2015 UTC,being bi has nothing to do with inevitably being a douche.  you've been a douche.
bisexual,3abyog,Yopro,3,Fri Jun 19 06:07:13 2015 UTC,You'll definitely be able to find someone as open minded as her. Don't stay with her just because of that. Cheating in the first place shows that you weren't 100% committed. I think you should explore your sexuality more instead of being tied down in a serious relationship. That's just what I would do. She deserves the truth about you cheating on her. Good luck!
bisexual,3abyog,TheLonelySamurai,2,Fri Jun 19 06:37:43 2015 UTC,"I think this is two distinct issues.   First, the relationship. No sense to beat yourself up over it, but you messed up by cheating. Sometimes the guilt is too much to overcome, and it sounds to be the case here. Never stay with somebody because you're afraid you'll never find somebody like them again, stay with them because you like who they are as a total person. Sounds to me like this is over and it's time to move on.   Second, the bi stuff. I think you need to get out there and explore a bit. Try not to worry so much about who with and what, just enjoy the experience (but be safe). If you feel a preference for one gender or the other, whatever man sexuality is fluid just go with the flow. Try not to nail yourself down to some kind of label system, just have fun.   Good luck!"

But not because you need to ""find yourself"" or any of that other bullshit. Break up with her because you cheated on her and are too wormy to even admit that to her. Break up with her because you're too freaking confused about yourself to even bother bringing someone else into your life.  Break up with her so she can find someone who SHE deserves, who won't cheat on her and then lie about it, and who she doesn't have to support.  I'm tired of this sub acting like the fiancees, fiances, boyfriends and girlfriends of the people who post here are somehow an abstract idea rather than a full person with all the same rights as the people who post here, who are hurting and would be devastated if they knew.  I'm tired of seeing people excuse cheating in this sub.

Please understand that I'm not trying to make an excuse, I'm ashamed of my behavior and I never said that cheating is somehow part of the bisexual identity.

I wouldn't have said anything if someone else did. But the fact that this entire sub didn't stop to take a moment to think about the girl on the other end of this equation is fucked up.   But in my opinion nothing is 100% right or wrong like that. It's way more complex, I could write a book with the whole story.  Please understand that I'm not trying to make an excuse   This is 100% an excuse though. You're trying to paint this with shades of grey. There was nothing wrong with your relationship that would lead you to cheat that could even begin to justify things. You aren't trapped in a loveless marriage with a wife who threatens to keep the kids and won't give sex. Your situation is entirely your fault here. That doesn't mean you're a bad person, but you really need to own up to this mistake before you can move on. You need to own up and tell your girlfriend first off all. Did you use condoms with these guys? How far did you go if you didn't use them? Do you need to get tested? Does she need to get tested?   I'm still confused and learning about myself and my orientation, that's it.   You didn't need to cheat to do that. It's obvious it sounds like you're the kind of guy who needs to be free to explore. Hell, maybe you're not bi but gay? Have you thought of that in depth at all? You don't sound very thrilled with sex with women.   I never said that cheating is somehow part of the bisexual identity.   I wasn't directing that at you, I was directing that at the sub at large. Them not calling you out on that is them tacitly admitting that ""hey, cheating is regrettable but totally expect this if you get involved with a bisexual person!"" The fact is, and no one wants to bring this up, but you're committing a bisexual stereotype. You cheated on your girlfriend because in the most primal sense she wasn't enough for you. That's what people are afraid of and where a ton of biphobia comes from. It's uncomfortable to see people proving stereotypes true.  I think you need to break up with this girl. You need to tell her what you did, whether or not she needs to get tested, and that it's nothing she did. This is going to suck for her to hear, but I think you need to do it. Not just for her sake, but for both of your sakes. It sounds like you really need to do some exploring to learn what your orientation is."

I'm just gonna say I'm confused and need some time to figure out my orientation if I'm breaking up with her.   Because she's an adult. Which is more than I can say about you at this point man. I think you need to understand that relationships come with responsibilities. She needs the agency to decide if she wants to get tested. It doesn't matter if you got tested or not before you came back, that's not up to you to decide this for her. You slept with other people, and then had sex with her. She also deserves to know, period. You did her wrong. You need to own up to it. This ""she would be miserable"" is more about you saving face than it is about you protecting her feelings. You don't want to own up to what you did, because you know it was a bad thing and makes you kind of a shitty person at the moment. But she deserves to know.

Your therapist doesn't mean things are black and white in terms of ""oh you cheated, nothing is black and white""!   That doesn't make sense at all. If I'm clean she's clean. Period.   Tough fucking shit. You took the choice out of her hands when you cheated. You owe her that agency back. You owe her the CHOICE to get tested or not. You could bring her the damn result papers and she would STILL have a right to go get tested if she wanted.  Period.   Again you're calling me a child based in one big mistake I've made   No, I'm calling you a child because of your continued attitude about it. You're not willing to take control of things after the fact. So you fucked up. Great. What matters is how you deal with it now. You're failing the test.  I don't give a shit how guilty you feel or how much this affects your depression. Yeah, I'm being a hardass now. I've got depression too, I deal with chronic pain, I deal with judgmental people.

Also coming out is a personal choice: some people find it freeing, especially if they identify with and are heavily involved in queer spaces; for others, people find it unnecessary unless it's being out to close family/friends, or if they're dating someone of the same gender. It's really up to you to decide whether or not you're comfortable with coming out to whoever, and it's up to you to decide whether or not the pros outweigh the cons. You do you."

I strongly disagree with the belief that someone's identity no longer matters once you're in a particular relationship, even a marriage. I see this as a main source of bi-erasure. You're suddenly ""gay/lesbian"" if you're with a same-sex partner or ""straight"" if you're with an opposite-sex partner.   However, I resonate with your hesitation. There are sometimes professional ramifications and definitely some personal ramifications. I am not out to my family, for example, because I am engaged to my male fiancé and they would think I was just trying to upset them (they express homophobic attitudes) because there would be ""no point"" to say I am bi if I am with a man. And I am not ready for that potentially hurtful conversation (yet).  EDIT: I just wanted to add that since women's same-sex attraction is often not taken seriously, you could probably get away with expressing your same-sex attraction via stuff like the woman crush Wednesday without many people batting an eyelash. I've never really tried to hide my attraction to women and yet people are shocked when they see me with a woman (we're poly) or know that I've had relationships with women. It's both hilarious and frustrating."

bisexual,3a93yb,ramboturd72,5,Thu Jun 18 05:11:58 2015 UTC,"To me bisexuality is being attracted to multiple genders. The nature of this attraction can vary from sex to romantic love to feet to BDSM. However, the label describes attraction not sexual history. A bisexual isn't any less of a bisexual because they have any had sex with only one gender/sex."
bisexual,3a93yb,AccountHaver25,3,Thu Jun 18 06:35:02 2015 UTC,"You don't need to have experience with multiple genders to prove you are bi. People might not believe you, but that is about them, not you. If you need to prove it to yourself, OK, but I believe attraction is all it takes. You have experienced your feelings.   That said, you don't have to come out to anyone if you don't want to. Or you can tell people you're questioning right now."
bisexual,3a93yb,aoeui-dhtns,3,Thu Jun 18 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've never understood people who are gay or straight who figured out their sexuality by having an experience with someone not of their preferred gender--the ""lightning bulb moment"" when they realized they were actually gay/straight. My first experiences with both men and women (or boys and girls, as the case was, age-wise) were all bad. It all felt awkward and not right. But I was still definitely romantically attracted to both, and just because my physical relationships didn't go well, it didn't change the nature of my attractions. My point is, having a relationship won't necessarily confirm anything you don't already feel right now. And as for anyone else requiring ""proof""…the only proof you need is what you already have, namely the way you feel."
bisexual,3a93yb,light_sky,2,Thu Jun 18 07:58:17 2015 UTC,"Because while I acknowledge that I am both attracted to men and women, I've only ever hooked up with men, never women, despite the fact that I desperately want to.    A lot of bisexual people feel this way as they're first discovering themselves, so what you're feeling is totally normal. To answer in short: the way that this issue resolves itself varies from person to person. Some people think they're bisexual and they get to it and turns out they aren't, or vice versa.   For me, I had experiences with other boys before I acknowledged my bisexuality, when I was young. Then I wrote that off as inconsequential, and considered myself straight for a long time, then I ""tried"" (I don't even know how to say it...) the bisexual label and was unsure about it until I had another male-male experience.  I recommend reading our FAQ, btw. It's okay to label yourself bicurious for now. Depending on how old you are, finding another girl to learn things with can be of varying levels of difficulty. Find out if your town has an LGBT community of any kind."
bisexual,3a93yb,greatkio,2,Thu Jun 18 05:59:08 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, and occasionally explain it to others, is that being bisexual just means you have the full deluxe Swiss army knife libido. You've already recognized what your main sexual attractions are, so you're past the major hurdle anyway. I do recommend also exploring your romantic, emotional and social attractions as well, because those are also important parts of your orientation.  That said, having the potential to be attracted to other women does not create any obligation in you to do anything you're not comfortable with, or to add yourself to any particular dating pool. The only thing that's really important is for you to be comfortable with your own thoughts and feelings. If you decide that experimenting with another person is important to you achieving that (and it's not my place to judge whether it should be for you or not,) all I would suggest is that you do so in a way which is respectful and safe for both you and whoever you choose to be with. Don't sabotage yourself by creating for yourself a negative experience, make it a positive one.  In my case, I never really planned to have a sexual experience with another guy after realizing I was bisexual. Once I got accustomed to the idea, I mostly just thought of it as a curiosity and something fun to fantasize about occasionally. The fact that I ever did was the result of the most freakish sort of fortuitous luck, and it ended up being a very positive thing. I can say that it made me more confident about the idea of having male partners thereafter, but it didn't really confirm for me anything I didn't already know about myself."
bisexual,3a93yb,Chris770,2,Thu Jun 18 10:06:37 2015 UTC,I came out first then ended up hooking up with a girl (who has now become my girlfriend) but anyways I decided that I was bi told some people and gradually became ok with it and THEN I drunkenly hooked up with this girl.   All in all it doesn't matter so much which comes first if it makes you feel better getting the experience first then go for it! If you then decide that you are not as attracted to women as you first thought then thats just that. In the end though you shouldn't have to prove your sexuality to anyone. Your feelings are your own and are always valid.
bisexual,3a93yb,jze53714,2,Thu Jun 18 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"I had an inkling that I was bi when I was in a straight relationship. Then one day I stumbled into getting a bj from a dude and I thought to myself, ""Huh, I guess I'm bi, because this is pretty great, but tits are also real nice."""
bisexual,3a93yb,Drake5271,2,Fri Jun 19 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"I had kissing experience with one girl and one night with another girl.  Then I met a guy and ended up marrying him. After our marriage ended, I was in about the same position as you: I knew that I liked having sex with girls, but would I like having sex with women? And more importantly, would I like being in a relationship with one? I didn't know. And there is only one way to find out: just do it. And you'll find out soon enough. There is nothing wrong with experimenting. I know there are a lot of gay people angry with us bisexuals for 'using them' and then 'going back to the opposite sex so we can profit from being able to pass for straight' and they tend to judge our experimenting rather harshly. But let me ask you this: isn't starting ány relationship an experiment? Because let's be honest: we never know for a 100% that this is THE person we want to be with. And we never know for a 100% that it is going to work out. Each and every relationship is an experiment: do we really match, can we find a way to enjoy our life together, can we find a way around the things where we don't match that well, do we match in bed? So, experiment away. Start dating women and you will find out if and how much you like it."

But that's not the same as being queer. People get more curious and talkative about that.   I think your family would like to know before you tell hundreds of people, just like they'd like to know first if you're getting married or something. They might feel ignored if literally everyone knows before they do. So I think you could tell a best friend or two, then your parents, then everybody else? But of course it's your identity so it's your decision. You should do what feels right, and you know best.   And I know you didn't ask, but: Only come out if it's safe to come out. If your parents won't be supportive, it really is better to go stealth until college. Some families are supportive and some are not, so think ahead and always take care of yourself. <3"

bisexual,3a64u4,Stjem05,13,Wed Jun 17 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"I think even in ""straight"" relationships, it's not unusual for attraction to ebb and flow. My husband and I go through phases where we are all up on each other all the time, and then phases where we are really good friends who live together and raise children together, and we both trust that the crazy sex action will return. It always does.   There are times when I get scared that maybe I've just gone completely lesbian, but then I wake up one day and I can't keep my hands off of him.   The other thing is, I compare all men to my husband. So it's really easy to see an attractive guy and think ""Meh, he's hot. But he's not my husband, who cooks for me and brings me coffee in bed and helped me deliver our child on the bathroom floor when the midwife was late.""  But, when I see a hot lady it's just ""Damn. She's hot. I'd do her."" Consequently, I tend to find waaaaay more hot ladies than hot men. Also, after years of not really fully admitting or embracing my attraction to women, it feels like making up for lost time. I had like almost 2 decades of checking out dudes, I'm having fun checking out ladies now."

bisexual,3a64u4,cbrachyrhynchos,2,Wed Jun 17 16:40:03 2015 UTC,Interesting. I also don't do casual sex well. I really don't want to hurt this guy though. How can I know if my feelings towards men are going to come back?  Can I ask you a few more questions too? How can I tell if I'm bi or lesbian? I'm having a hard time truly determining. There habe definitely been times when I wanted my bfs body in a carnal way. But more often is just been about wanting to connect with him and I just had sex for emotional reasons. Is that ok and fair to him?

bisexual,3a7q2a,CordycepsJoel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:35:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like you're not just talking about coming out to your spouse, but to everyone: is it a good idea to be publicly bi even if you're in an opposite-sex relationship?  There are always extenuating circumstances so I won't say that my answer is right for everyone, but all things being equal: it's absolutely a good idea!  It's good for you because everyone should feel comfortable in their own skin.  You're bi and you have just as much right to be proud of it as anyone else!  And it's good for other people because it helps break down stereotypes and encourages diversity.  One of the reasons it took me so long to realize I was bi was because I had a set image of what a bi person was like, and it didn't fit me: I didn't know that I could be happily married and monogamous and still bi.  Your example could help someone else find the courage to come out, and preempt bigotry or even just poor assumptions in others: if you've got a friend that someday learns their date is bi or their child is bi, they may remember you and not be so quick to assume that this means ""cheater"" or ""greedy"".  Not everyone may react well, but that's not something anyone here can weigh for you: whether it's worth it is going to depend on what your friends are like (even the LGBTQ ones or the LGBTQ-friendly ones), and how much hostility you're willing to tolerate.  If you've got a good bunch of friends, though, I'd say go for it."

Just know that we aren't all like that and the level of acceptance can vary from city to city.  NOTE: My comment are from my own perspective as a gay GUY, but the sentiment applies equally to my bi sisters."
bisexual,3a3swx,TheWarringMuses,5,Fri Jun 19 06:08:24 2015 UTC,"It's hard to explain to people that sexuality is a scale. I'm like 75% straight: I love guys and have never dated a woman, but women are beautiful and I like having sex with them. This causes people to think I'm faking it for attention or something. I've had a lesbian tell me to ""just pick a side"" before!!  I think bi guys have it even worse. My boyfriend is bi but, kind of like me, hasn't dated a man and mostly likes women. Try admitting that to a girl you're courting! Nothing clears the floor faster. Unless they're cool like me ;) lol"
bisexual,3a3swx,scumboi,3,Fri Jun 19 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"Haha ""unless they're cool like me"" - I like you...  I contributed to this problem myself when I used the label ""bisexual"" as an intermediate, less scary label when I was afraid to come out all the way. I didn't use that lie for very long though. So I understand why some may doubt the sincerity of any self-applied label. But most bi guys that i know are quite comfortable with their sexuality: if they WERE gay, they would have no problem admitting it.  I've often explained it this way: Sexuality is way too complicated to be described by the three words gay, bi, or straight. It's not even a continuum but more like a complex tree.   I know guys who self identify as straight but who enjoy the ocassional blow job from a guy ... but they are still 100% attracted to women not men. I agree that straight is the most accurate label but some would argue that one blow job from a guy makes you ""gay"". That's just silly. I had sex with a woman once - I was gay then and still am - that experience didn't make me bisexual it only meant that I was experimental!"
bisexual,3a3swx,MiG31_Foxhound,3,Fri Jun 19 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement :) To be fair, I've been to a bunch of Pride/queer events in past cities and had a great time, so hopefully I can find the welcoming spaces in this one as well. At least we'll always have /r/bisexual :)"

It is not necessarily true that a single act of othering represents the feeling of the crowd, but I get that OP tried something and felt shot down. That is sad.   It is not always like that, OP, and I hope you will try again. For years my then-(female) spouse and I went to SF Pride and didn't have any issues; more recently my now-(female) partner and I (obviously MTF TG) go and we have none, either.   Some Pride events in big cities have become crazy. It may suit you to go to a smaller event. Though I have never been, Portland is said to be nice; and my partner and I love Oakland Pride.   I hope this negative incident inspires OP to zero in on the negative event and allow the bartender to own it, not them."

Aside from my tshirt and the tshirt of one other, the group I was with looked like we were two hetero couples with kids, but in reality, we were all queer in one way or another. We got no ill treatment or weird looks. I was really nervous to go to Pride, actually, because I never really felt like Pride was for me, and having the tshirt made me feel like I was announcing my right to be there, too."

I don't know that it was necessary, but it made me feel good and more confident with myself about going. I get so tired of being invisible and feeling like my sexuality is irrelevant if I don't happen to have a female partner at that exact moment that the tshirt was my way of taking ownership of Pride and not being afraid to say, ""I'm here, I'm queer, and I am NOT invisible!"""

Either way, he's an ass and was unprofessional, but I was hoping the other possibilities would make you feel a bit better that it might not have been about you, but more reflective of him (if that makes any sense??)

To be honest we live in the ""gay"" neighborhood so this isn't a new experience, there are a ton of gay bars around us that we don't go to anymore because we either look like we're ""straights"" crashing the party, or people assume my BF is secretly gay and is trying to hook up with someone on the sly. It's annoying.  I've been to Pride in a couple other of cities and had a great time, although I've always been with a group or with another woman.

He wore his ""I put the B in LGBT"" shirt and a lot of people gave him a thumbs up... It really depends on where you are. Here in this city (unnamed b/c it's so small and I don't want to get into it) most people are Bi or Poly as far as I can tell, and the LG are pretty ok with everyone (as far as I can tell at the few ""Gay"" bars we have around here).   When I was in Seattle and went to Pride no one gave any shits as long as you paid because it was one heck of a busy weekend and everyone was looking for the money. Going to Capitol Hill on non-Pride weekends you just have to deal with a lot of homeless kids, but they're pretty cool with whomever comes by.   Sorry some people suck."
bisexual,3a3swx,scumboi,9,Wed Jun 17 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"as ""alternative"" sexuality (and gender blending) has become more common and mainstream, i feel like there is less inclusiveness in the ""gay community.""  story time for all you under 30...  when i was first ""out"" i went to the only gay bar in my city (a fair sized college town) and as it turned out, the only gay bar within about 2 hours of driving. as soon as i walked in, i felt included. guys introduced themselves - many of them to see if i was single and down to fuck, but some just to say ""welcome."" later in the week, walking down the street or in a store, some of those same guys said hello and made sure i knew that we had met at that bar. 20 years later, i walk into a gay bar and not a single person says hello. there is no sense that i belong there; it could just as easily be a str8 bar in any city, other than the pride flag hanging on the wall and the pics of hot guys drinking Bud Light.  i will admit, part of it is probably because i am now over 30 (may as well go lay down and die, lol!) but it is also because we (gays, lesbians, bisexuals) don't have to fight to have our own space. most don't have to worry about being ""outed"" and losing a job, a home, or our family. we don't have to worry that we will be locked away in a mental institution or thrown in jail for ""indecent behavior."" we don't have to wonder if the police are going to crash through the door and arrest us just for being in a gay bar.  then again, that is part of what Pride is about. remembering where we were, celebrating where we are now, and looking forward to a better tomorrow for those who come after. so maybe that's why some people don't want ""hetero's"" at Pride. it might explain it, but it doesn't make it right. if someone is at Pride, whether obviously gay, lesbian, bi, trans, whatever, or they appear to be as straight as an arrow, if they are there to celebrate and support us, we should welcome them."

I told my first friend I was bi when I was 17, but he was already openly bi as long as I knew him which was years. I've always had a mix of straight, bi, and gay friends so I've been going to gay bars since I was 21 and only had a bad experience a few months ago.  I was in the very accepting gay bar with a woman and a lot of friends and a guy who knew us was talking to me. He asked what my orientation was and when I told him he started swearing at me. My friends kind of gathered around and didn't say anything. I politely asked him to leave me alone and then the bartender threw him out when the woman I was with told him what happened.  That bar, along with the others in other cities I've been to, has always been pretty cool to go to. More fun and friendly than regular straight places, you are generally greeted by someone if you haven't been in for a while and can talk to anyone in the place without fear of embarrassment. Go to a straight bar and the guys are too busy trying to impress the ladies while the ladies are too busy trying to be better than their lady friends. It's a ridiculous show.   I should also note that I've lived in both small towns and large cities in the U.S.. I currently reside in the east coast in a tourist city."

People are coming around to the thought of people being gay not by choice and suffer all the hate. But being Bi or Pan no longer guarantees that Joe next door being married to a woman is 100% strait, and people can't handle that. (Sorry I can't find the video) I am fortunate enough to have come out to my friends and have all of them accept that (Sometimes multiple times because their dumb asses but their my dumb asses). But what you experienced was more they hate us so lets hate them mentality. They assume your strait and thus hate on you. I see this all the time on Tumblr so much that a strait white girl in her description said she was sorry for being strait and white. The world is already so full of hate that for most people it is all that they can respond with. I have been to some Prides and it has slowly devolved into what you experienced. The erasure we experience is wide spread that some people don't know what the B in LGBT means, and for that we are faced with a lot of hate. I am bad at endings but yes you might have to deck your self out in the bi flag and express it. We are really in a bad place because we get hate from both sides.

Our experiences with going to stuff like that have been either funny and inane, or downright nasty.  We've gone to Pride events before and been repeatedly handed ""straight but not narrow"" stickers and been told how nice it is to see ""people like you"" being so supportive, and that was just sort of amusing.  On the other hand, my girlfriend will tell you that a woman who gets identified as keeping a bisexual guy ""out of circulation"" can get some truly evil looks and really nasty attitude from gay guys. That's just the tip of the iceberg.  Our partner (poly, he's straight) simply gets snidely questioned about his sexual preferences for being involved in a semi-triad with a bisexual guy, which is rude to the point we'd rather spare him that altogether.  So if you decide you'd rather not go to those sorts of things, none of us would at all blame you."

bisexual,3a3swx,Scratchums,4,Wed Jun 17 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"I thought pride is supposed to be standing together against discriminaton,  so it wouldn't matter if you're LGBT or heterosexual as long as you're not homophobic.  So it sucks that this happened to you, give them a bad review or something,  maybe management will realise their staff are not great. Remember the staff who saw what happened and did serve you and ignore the jerk who didn't."
bisexual,3a3swx,vincenzof,4,Wed Jun 17 12:09:30 2015 UTC,I think being Bi and in a hetero relationship is almost more of a reason to go to pride - If there's a growing attitude that us bi people are only half-arsed or nut fully qualified members of the LGBT+ community then these people need reminding. And on top of that there's nothing wrong with actual straight couples at pride anyways in my opinion.
bisexual,3a3swx,hewentthataway,2,Wed Jun 17 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest. These people don't think bisexuals are ""real"" members of the GLB ""community"" anyway."

Check, sketchy. It's probably just a weighted system. If too many triggers(lol) are found in url/content, it gets blocked. Go ask your parents to unblock it.     Can you still access other gay-friendly sites like magazines? If so, then you need to chill."
bisexual,3a5776,Tomtoise,7,Wed Jun 17 10:45:36 2015 UTC,"This. Sky doesn't have time to peruse every web page that pops up online for content, so they just use a simple filter. URL with both ""tumbler"" and ""sex"" in it? Yeah, they'll block that if the subscriber wants it blocked. If they're blocking by default, this should be trivial to resolve by calling them up. This isn't a ""bisexual filter"" but a broad content filter. Just tell them you want the content filter disabled. False positives like this are a dime a dozen. Sky is not oppressing you."
bisexual,3a5776,GradysGhost,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:56:59 2015 UTC,I'm not claiming to be oppressed. I'm taking issue with Internet providers implementing shoddy 'catch all' systems that block completely innocuous content. The fact that in will likely sweep up bisexual/homosexual content (as evidenced) is an indication of the dangerous territory we are in both in terms of Internet freedom and the increasing regularity of companies dictating their own moral standards on the populous.
bisexual,3a5776,Krullenhoofd,4,Wed Jun 17 11:18:36 2015 UTC,"Sadly, bad cases make for bad laws. I believe that there was a couple of rapes perpetrated by 13-14 year old boys who had accessed porn on the internet. So instead of blaming crap parenting, porn was blamed and then the filter law came in. It's sad that certain innocent things get blocked, but no need to label it as a LGBT issue, I am convinced if the URL was heterosexual-community.tumblr.com it would have been blocked as well."

As Pride is approaching I decided that instead of being mistaken for the straight-friend tag along like I usually am, I'd get myself kitted out in all the Bi colours... flags, bracelets, ribbons, the lot - I'm so excited! So I hit the internet for some inspiration. First block I thought might have been a mistake, second one perhaps not.  Although I disagree with any sort of opt-out internet policing, if it was a matter of sexual content it would leave a slightly less bitter taste in my mouth. But this was a page about fucking tie dying ribbons... so I guess it was the Bi/homosexual nature that was the risqué element that required blocking the delicate eyes of children? I am so offended and LIVID.  Kids and teenagers questioning or agonising over your sexuality - good luck finding answers, support and community online. Unless you suddenly find the confidence to explain to your parents/account holders precisely why you need them to unblock 'over 18' content i.e. LGBTQ forums. I wonder how many times being greeted by 'SKY SHEILD - SITE BLOCKED' when looking for some info on their bi/homosexuality it will take before they shrink away with the feeling that their sexuality is indecent and illicit and that exploring it could get them into trouble.  This is dangerous. I am so angry."
bisexual,3a5776,cripplesmith,2,Wed Jun 17 09:29:20 2015 UTC,This is nothing to get offended about. It just shows how bloody dumb the automatic porn filters are that are mandatory now for all UK internet service providers. As soon as any word with sex and the tumblr.com domain is detected it's banned. It's not Sky deciding to erase or be offensive. It's just a stupid piece of shit software problem.

bisexual,3a5pf3,malevil,14,Wed Jun 17 12:57:08 2015 UTC,"My personal theory for this is that straight movies/television will put a man and a woman in roles and approach that from the understanding that, hey, he was a boy she was a girl, can I make it any more obvious? It's that having a man and a woman on screen is half the work. They don't put a lot of effort into writing romances.  There are, of course, exceptions. Parks and Rec and Brooklyn Nine Nine both do an incredible job making me care about their straight romance, because they actually put effort into developing it.  Gay movies have to work to sell it. They don't have the benefit of deeply ingrained heteronormativity. They don't have the benefit of years and years of films with a ton of men and like, one woman, the love interest. So more effort is put into writing romance and it is therefore way more engaging."

There is something about seeing the archetypes you enjoy in media, except with...yourself there.  The other day I found a M/M romance where the one guy is a bisexual trans guy. I read the book and I fucking cried, despite it being a generally fluffy romance novel. I loved it. It defied all the stereotypes. The trans guy was bi. He was happy with himself and his genitals. The cis guy was gay, and was happy with the trans guy and his genitals. Just...fuck yes to all of it!"

bisexual,3a5w04,rainthrow,9,Wed Jun 17 13:57:41 2015 UTC,"First off, I would like to say a disclaimer-   We cannot decide your sexuality for you.  Anything anyone says here is just their opinion on it, and it's still up for you to decide for yourself.   Now, for my opinion:  I think you also seem to be caught in the whole ""bisexuals don't like trans or non-binary people"" myth.  The common definition for bisexuality is and has been for years ""the attraction to two or more genders"".  Many bisexuals are attracted to people all across the gender spectrum!  (Also, it might be your wording, but genders are male, female, agender, non-binary, etc., not lesbian, gay, bi, pan, etc.  Those latter things are sexualities of the people you find attractive.)  I'm not as familiar with the various definitions of pansexuality, but the way I define it is ""attraction to all gender identities"" or ""attraction to people regardless of their gender"".  You could go as far as to say that pansexuals are also bisexual (but not all bisexuals are pansexuals), but I know some people find offense in that statement for some reason.  Also, bisexuality is not usually an even split, and your attraction levels towards genders can change.  For example, when I first came out to myself, I figured I was maybe a 80/20 (Male:Other) split, but I would say that it's become a lot more even since I actually started to accept it and heteronormativity (for lack of a better term - I found girls attractive but I couldn't see myself dating one) faded.  Emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction can be different splits too.  You can be a lot more romantically and emotionally attracted to females and a lot more sexually attracted to males.  Because of all that, it leads back to the ""it's your choice"" thing.  You can choose to identify as not-straight or queer (more general terms), bisexual, pansexual, etc. or a combination of those.  Personally, I identify as both bi and pan, but I prefer the bisexual label for a lot of (personal) reasons."
bisexual,3a5w04,raveninwhite,3,Wed Jun 17 14:19:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for clearing things up. I'm hopelessly clueless as to what all these lgbt terms really mean, so thank you for all of that. I really like that idea of orientation being a personalized, subjective thing, not something other people can definitively say you are, like some sort of empirical science. I'm leaning toward identifying as both bi and pan, but mostly pan right now."
bisexual,3a5w04,raveninwhite,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:26:24 2015 UTC,I'm glad I could help!
bisexual,3a5w04,djb_thirteen,3,Thu Jun 18 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"Question: ""Can anyone tell me if I’m pansexual or bisexual?"".  Short answer: No, that's for you to decide.  The (very detailed, well written, and correct) above comments are largely padding to that answer."
bisexual,3a5w04,LauraKy,3,Wed Jun 17 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, I seriously dislike the 'fuck labels' tendency. Because that's only because bisexuality can be confusing and is basically biphobic more than really 'fuck labels'. You can view bisexual in two ways. First you have the umbrella bisexual definition: being sexually and/or romantically attracted to more than one gender. Then there is your personal bisexual definition. Because the definition above is so broad that you can feel the need to narrow it down a bit, or to explain how it works for you personally. So these are the area's you can cover in your personal definition: - how many genders do you like: 2, more or all of the different kinds of genders. - is it a steady thing (as in this has been generally the same all through my life) or is it fluid (it has been changing) or something else. - how is it spread out: is there a difference between your sexual and your romantic attraction to certain genders. - is gender expression important to you. As you can see, if you make your own bisexual story, there can be as many different bisexuals as there are people. And people who are on the far spectrum of bisexuality (as in attracted to all the different kinds of genders and gender expression usually not very important as criterion for attraction) call themselves pansexual. As someone else already said: all pansexuals are bisexual, but not all bisexuals are pansexual (although most bisexuals are polysexuals)."
bisexual,3a5w04,Lyzoriax,2,Wed Jun 17 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"Oh haha sorry about that, I didn't mean to sound offensive. I'm really just clueless about what these lgbt terms mean, and I've personally avoided them all this time because it's like everything has a name, and it's so confusing and I felt like it only complicated things. But thank you so, so much for educating me. I've been mostly in the closet for so long, that this was the only time I found the courage to ask about this (this is a throwaway account though, so I don't know if there's really much courage in there lol), but I'm glad I did. I like the idea of it all being a personal story; right now I'm leaning toward being bi and pan, but mostly pan."
bisexual,3a5w04,Lyzoriax,2,Thu Jun 18 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"First of Sexuallity is fluid. It can change all the time. Secondly no one can tell you what it is you feel. I understand you completely. I'm a girl as well and I always thought I was straight. There was a time where I thought I might be a lesbian because I constantly felt a certain connection towards girls and that confused me to no end! It actually took me a while (I know it sounds silly) to grasp that I was simply attracted to both men and women. I would even say I am attracted to women a bit more than men. And that brought on the next confusion: am I bisexual? Or pan? Or a lesbian who occaionaly finds guys attractive? In the end you decide what term feels right for you. I tend to say I am queer if someone asks. When they don't know what that means I go further explaining that I prefer women over men but dont like them exclusively. If they ask for my sexuallity specifically I go with bisexual just because I don't really care about terms and that is a term most people get without needing to explain (my sexuallity is so fluid I don't really feel like any term fits me 100% apart from queer as in ""not-straight""-sexuality). So really go with what you feels right. It's your sexuallity and your right to define what you are."

In the future, be careful talking about this to the people who sign your checks. When there is a power dynamic like that, you've got to play it safe.   She's entitled to her own opinion, but she's not entitled to her own facts. What she is doing is called erasure. It's cruel and oppressive and careless. She doesn't get to tell you that your feelings are a lie. She doesn't feel your feelings, only you do. Only you have the authority to judge who you are. She ought to keep her big mouth shut and listen when bi people say what it is to be bi.   She probably doesn't even realize she was saying hateful things. I'm sorry; it's not your fault."

As an aside, as nice as your boss may have been to you up to this point it's prudent to remember that what you have is still a professional relationship first. Getting too emotionally close to someone who has power over you can be risky for exactly the reasons that played out here. Just something to keep in mind for hte future."

Some people you can get to understand, but most people will cling to that and there's not much you can do about it.

As she's taken on a mentoring/parenting role in your relationship, she might like to see herself as the wise one, advising and guiding you. This can make it difficult for her to hear and accept things from you that challenge her world view. She might be more open if she reads about bisexuality from third-parties, either in books or web sites."

I'm sorry your manager said these things to you, OP. That was really insensitive of her. I can definitely understand needing some space, but you should really try to weigh whether that need exceeds your need to socialize with your other coworkers. Don't let her presence ruin your relationships with them.  I've had some rough friendships in the past, and I've felt betrayed by a number of friends. Based on your post, I think that her betrayal wasn't malicious even though it was ignorant, so if you want to keep her as a friend, then you should definitely explain how you feel she betrayed your confidence in her. Explain how you felt in response to the hurtful things she said.  You might not bring her around to a better understanding of bisexuality anytime soon, but that doesn't mean she will never understand, and that also doesn't mean you guys can't be friends."

I'm sure you feel this way right now. The stigma against bisexuality is real and is mostly going unchallenged.   In order to do this we need to stand up for ourselves and explain to people that just like gays and straights, WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE THIS WAY and that WE WERE BORN THIS WAY. Sorry if the caps lock seems overwhelming, but reading this tears me apart and fills me with rage.   My mother reacted the same way and said that I was just confused. It pissed me off so badly and I did what I could to explain to her but I feel like my message still didn't get through to her. It left me feeling frustrated and alone. If your boss ever brings it up again, explain to her that your sexuality is REAL and that she needs to do her research. If you can't work up the courage then I understand.

You are valid, even if other people are too ignorant and un aware to understand. Another thing to consider is the fact that the stuff she told you is the same load of shit that straight people have told me and say to gay people. I've been told it's a phase the whole spiel. I realized I was predominantly  gay at 11. I'm almost 22 now and I'm still predominantly gay. Your sexuality is just as valid as any one else's. What your boss needs to realize is that other people experience sexuality different than her and that her narrow idea of sexuality isn't the only valid one.   I hope you feel better soon.

If you want to start trying to explain this to people, just be prepared for the fact that you're going to end up smiling, patting some of them on the head, and accepting that the majority of monosexual people are just sort of limited in this way (to one degree or another.) It takes a particular sort of imagination to be able to understand someone else's perspective without sharing it, and not everyone has that ability.  ""Coming out"" to my parents was the most anticlimactic thing ever, but that's mostly due to the fact that I was raised into a nonreligious liberal family. My mother was slightly taken aback, and my dad was very deadpan on the subject. (He's a very uncomplicated man of few words, that's normal for him.) My brother seriously believed I was playing some sort of joke on our folks up until the point where I literally put a guy I was involved with in front of him, and he still doesn't really get it. I was very kindly asked by my mother not to let my grandparents in on it, because she felt (probably rightly) that they wouldn't be able to understand it, and trying to would just cause them unnecessary distress. It was also suggested to me that it wouldn't be wise to make it widely known until I'd gone off to college, because we lived in a very conservative rural community. The two guys I was involved with during high school were made very welcome by my folks, as long as they were willing to pitch in (I lived on a farm.)"

I recall asking my mother about a casual friend of hers who lived with another lady, who other people had said were ""odd,"" and I was simply told ""it's their way, mind your business."" Stuff like that just gave me the impression that people having same-sex relationships wasn't something to go poking my nose into or comment on, and that was that. When I'd asked why other people were rude about it, I was just told they're ""being busybodies."""

bisexual,3a5f3b,rugmaker2000,8,Wed Jun 17 10:59:04 2015 UTC,"OP, I'm going to be honest: We can't tell you what to think or what to do. We don't know the full situation, and how much of this is you projecting your fears on her versus how much is her being close-minded.  That being said: I think maybe you need to sit down and have a talk with her? This is just me, and I'm actually in the opposite boat as you (I'm homoromantic, so it's mostly male partners I'm explaining I'm bisexual to, even though I have no desire to be in anything but a monogamous relationship when I am in a relationship), but being bisexual is enough a part of me that I feel I need to tell my partners.  Maybe sit her down, and first get into this:  ""Honey, I need to ask you something. It's been bothering me. Why do you keep asking me things about gay men and gay relationships? Is there something going on I need to know about? You know I want to be open with you, and I want to know if there is something bothering you."" (OP I'm gonna be honest again: She probably found some gay porn you were watching or something and this is her way of digging at you without coming right out and saying it.)  Also, work on this part: Do you want anything out of her for this? Is there things you want her to do in the bedroom? I hate saying this, but even if there is, perhaps acting like there isn't might be a good idea, if you want to put the horse before the cart in this discussion? She might be more receptive if you sit her down and explain there isn't anything to do with this information, it's just always been a part of you, and you felt like you wanted her to know because it eats you up keeping a secret from her."
bisexual,3a5f3b,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"Very good points. I know she hasn't seen me watching any gay porn or anything, I think it's just me/my mannerisms, interests, and habits in general that are tipping her off. Maybe she's seen me look at a guy a little too long, I don't know. You're right, something is tipping her off though, but I shouldn't be surprised by that: it's who I am, and I'm finally not trying to hide those small things.  It is eating me up inside. If I can get her to understand that I've always been this way, and that I'm not suddenly going to hook up with a guy, I think we'll be OK.  I think that's a good point in telling her that I'm not expecting anything to change because of this.  You also nailed it on the head when you said that it's a big enough part of you that you feel you should share it. It's a huge part of me and explains so much about me.  Thanks for your thoughts. I might try to talk to her when things calm down a bit in our lives."
bisexual,3a5f3b,TheLonelySamurai,6,Wed Jun 17 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"I know she hasn't seen me watching any gay porn or anything   Are you absolutely positive? In my experience guys aren't nearly as good at hiding their porn as they think they are, and browsers often have a way of bringing secrets to light. If your wife was searching for ""gardening"" and ""gay guys sucking cock"" popped up, well, she might get a bit suspicious!   I think it's just me/my mannerisms, interests, and habits in general that are tipping her off. Maybe she's seen me look at a guy a little too long, I don't know.   This could also be true. I know I don't have as much of a filter as I think I do. I'll compliment a guy and a girl in the same sentence and not realize it until someone goes ""...I didn't know you were bi dude.""   You're right, something is tipping her off though, but I shouldn't be surprised by that: it's who I am, and I'm finally not trying to hide those small things.   This is also true. Your SO has known you long enough to know you inside and out, and she probably knows you are actively keeping a secret of some kind.   It is eating me up inside.   I am so sorry. :( I can't imagine how that must feel.   If I can get her to understand that I've always been this way, and that I'm not suddenly going to hook up with a guy, I think we'll be OK.   I would emphasize that this isn't anything new. Don't say ""I've been questioning myself lately"" or anything of the sort. Explain that you've felt this way for as long as you can remember. Stress that you were this way before you met her, before you married her. Even if all of these things aren't 100% true, it will put things in a way that doesn't call into question her womanhood or her role as your wife and partner.   I think that's a good point in telling her that I'm not expecting anything to change because of this.   Right, just explain to her your reasoning for wanting to tell her is because you love her, and it hurts keeping a secret from someone you love. It hurts feeling like she doesn't know all of you.   You also nailed it on the head when you said that it's a big enough part of you that you feel you should share it. It's a huge part of me and explains so much about me.   Exactly. It is a big deal! It may not be the only thing about us. Hell, like I said, I'm homoromantic so most of my relations are with men, but I still feel as if being bisexual is a huge part of me. It doesn't mean anything more than that I like men and women (and nonbinary people!), but it's still a huge chunk of my personality and part of what makes me the person I am.   Thanks for your thoughts. I might try to talk to her when things calm down a bit in our lives.   I wish you all the best, and I'm here if you ever need to talk, okay?"

I think OP might have to do a bit of aftercare with her, and let her know how sexy and in love with her he is, and hopefully his wife is caring enough to realize what a huge step he's taken by trusting her with his heart like this. It's obvious he's being eaten up by it, and I really hope his wife is the kind of woman who will take him into her arms and tell him it's alright.  D: I just hope OP comes through this all okay, and that his fears are all in his head. Maybe she'll be a little miffed he didn't tell her sooner. I'm hoping that is as far as it goes, and that her little hints are indicative of her already knowing something. :)"
bisexual,3a5f3b,MatticusVP,3,Thu Jun 18 01:01:35 2015 UTC,"Did you know that you were bisexual when you started dating or before you met your wife? How long have you two been married?  No, you dont need to put a label on yourself. But keeping secrets is not conducive to a healthy relationship. The thing Im seeing here is that you really want to tell her, youre just afraid of her reaction. If you do tell her you need to make sure you let her know that you are ""committed to my current relationship and would never cheat on my wife"" and tell her that you want her to know every part of who you are.  I find it important for myself to let the person Im with know that Im bi early on. It gives them the opportunity to move on if they cant handle it before getting too emotionally involved. Also, Id prefer not to be with a person who couldnt accept me for who I am.  Ultimately, youre going to have to come to a decision about how you want to handle it, and you know your relationship better than any of us. I wish you luck and hope everything works out either way."

Been married a little under 8 years. I didn't acknowledge I was bisexual until this past year (I think I've always known to some degree or other). I've always been made fun of for doing and saying things a bit feminine, sometimes I'd catch myself admiring a guy, but I ignored everything and my feelings. My compartmentalization of things that didn't make sense kept me from acknowledging it.   But keeping secrets is not conducive to a healthy relationship.   That's what my therapist keeps telling me...   If you do tell her you need to make sure you let her know that you are ""committed to my current relationship and would never cheat on my wife"" and tell her that you want her to know every part of who you are.   This is how I want it to come across. I tend to not be so tactful when breaking big news though, which contributes to me being so scared of sharing this part of me.   Also, Id prefer not to be with a person who couldnt accept me for who I am.   This is a hard thing to think about, but I feel the same way. I think. I don't know the answer right now to ""would I put up with someone who doesnt accept me for who I am if it means I get to be with my wife and kids?""

I like hot girls. I like hot people""). My issue is more that she's a pretty bad bi stereotype, given her waffling back and forth between alex and larry in s1, and her general tendency to leave people as soon as they become ""boring"" to her. Pretty much reinforces the lying/cheating/never satisfied with monogamy myths. I used to like her while acknowledging that she was a bad person who needed to sort out her shit, but after how she treated Alex (and everyone tbh) in season 3 I'm kind of done with her."

bisexual,3a2kbe,queerinRI,2,Wed Jun 17 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"My understanding for this was always that because people seem to think bisexual only means male OR female, and because there's so much biphobia and stereotyping - it's also sexualized. Despite being pretty much a synonym, pansexual is more acceptable just because people perceive it as meaning the  entire gender spectrum, even though that's what bisexual always meant. Also, when people start diving into other new labels, they like the emphasize love. The stigma is being attached to the orientation of bisexuality, as if it's definition.  Monoseuxality is literally like... Straight person: ""oh it's like our relationship, except it's two dudes /women"". Just way simpler for people to understand right now."
bisexual,3a2kbe,graymankin,2,Wed Jun 17 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"Whenever I've used a non-monosexual label, it gets constantly challenged. Some days I'm more into guys, others more into girls, sometimes both sometimes neither. So it makes sense that someone who faces constant pressure by their community that bisexuality doesn't exist or is negative and gets their sexuality challenged frequently would want to avoid labels.  At least that's my experience. Maybe that's why we have ""fluid"" as a label."
bisexual,3a2kbe,mon18,15,Wed Jun 17 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"I actually want to have a conversation about this because for a while when I was figuring myself out, I had a lot of thoughts of ""it would just be easier if I was a lesbian,"" and then I found comfort in the lack of a label. Until I said fuck it, this is who I am so eat it.   I wouldn't say it's NOT progress. It's definitely not a leap in the right direction, but it's a step, however small a step. Maybe a nudge.   I agree that we never hear the ""I hate labels"" argument from monosexual characters, but I think someone could argue that it's relatively 'easy' to be able to label monosexual character (and I do realize this starts it's own conversation on why is that the case). However, can you even name a non-monosexual Hollywood character? Let alone an instance of a non-monosexual character battling with labels?   Also bisexual is not the only label that makes people start having existential conversations. There are so many other labels, both involving sexuality and gender, that are not the black and white societal 'norms' that can cause the same issue."

bisexual,3a2kbe,orcawhales_and_owls,6,Tue Jun 16 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really excuse it imo though. Yeah, you can write ignorant characters, but it's how you deal with those character's views that's very telling. They say biphobic things, and Piper never ever stands up for herself. You could argue that she doesn't care, or doesn't want to, or anything like that, but at the end of the day, its an active decision by the writers to have those characters saying biphobic things and Piper just...going with it.  And to somebody who does have biphobic views, even if they're not being intentionally biphobic, that's reinforcing to them the idea that it's ok. This character, who's obviously not a lesbian, is called a lesbian, and the show never questions it. So people think it's ok to call bi girls lesbians, even though so many bi girls I know, including myself, dislike that.  Plus, if you consider stuff like the transgender character (can't remember her name, i haven't watched any OITNB in a while /: ), people say transphobic things and she calls them out on it and it's made clear it's not ok. The biphobia just...slides."
bisexual,3a2kbe,korbl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:44:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't really see where a reaction to the biphobia would come from. Piper is too busy feeling sorry for herself and lashing out at everyone around her with manipulation to come to terms with her own sexuality and do the thinking about what it is, Larry is all pissed about Piper cheating on him because he's a selfish asshole too, and the other prisoners are at best cordial with her because she is the most privileged person there.  Cal and his fiance could react on her behalf, now that I think about it. They're the most likely ones to know anything about bisexuality, and it'd be kind of funny to see Cal outrage his parents by talking about a same sex experience he had years ago. Unfortunately, they're just not featured a lot.  But it'd be nice if they would speak up when Piper's parents start bitching about her having girlfriends."
bisexual,3a2kbe,orcawhales_and_owls,2,Wed Jun 17 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like if they're not going to address the biphobia, it shouldn't be there. I know it's wrrong, other bi people I know know it's wrong, but to people who don't know or care about biphobia, it's telling them that this is an ok way to think, and for actively biphobic people, it could even be reinforcing those views.  In real life, yeah, it's hard to speak up sometimes but this is an show, where everything is scripted and written. Maybe it's not even intentional that the writers have included biphobia, but I feel like there's been enough criticism that by now, they have no excuse. Even if Piper just said ""I'm bisexual"" when somebody acts like she'd ""turned gay"" or something, that'd be a start, and could easily just be an offhand comment, y'know?  I'm behind on watching it (I'll get there eventually...) but that does sound like an interesting scenario :)"
bisexual,3a2kbe,brutalistprince,5,Thu Jun 18 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's like that on purpose. Larry bounces around lesbian and hetero every single time Alex is brought up, to the point of it being obvious that he just doesn't think bisexuality exists. He actually says ""maybe she's bisexual"" at one point but then quickly dismisses it as if it wasn't actually a real thing."
bisexual,3a2kbe,orcawhales_and_owls,2,Tue Jun 16 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"It might be done on purpose, but its not clear and that's a problem. If they're deliberately saying biphobic things, they need to make it clear that this is biphobic and that this is not ok. If it's left open, it's not clear and they're just reinforcing biphobic ideas and implying that they're ok."

A conniving, manipulative crazy person who gets her ex girlfriend in trouble with her PO because she was lonely? So many characters that have relationships with both men and women are portrayed like sociopaths.   I just want to see one boring bisexual person on television.

I want someone who likes me for me, and that means being cool with me squealing over a TV show or out shooting them at the gun range.  Sexually I don't really have a preference between body types. I have a preference for certain sexual acts though, which generally tends to mean I go for people who enjoy penetrating me, male or female.  Could I fall in love with a woman? Yeah, I could. Right now my current play partner is a trans woman and I think my feelings for her might be crossing into the 'more than fwb' territory. It's definitely not unheard of for me to feel things for a woman."

However, I can't help but feel as though the flippant way that these gay women respond to the possibility it's 'the world's most casual coming out'. Uh... Maybe it is.

There are more than two options: saying that you would ""go gay for"" somebody is an acknowledgment of somebody's attractiveness. Being able to do so for somebody of the same gender illustrates both security in their own identity and an acceptance of same-sex attraction as an acceptable, even common occurrence for any one to feel."

bisexual,3a3sc3,femmefolly,5,Wed Jun 17 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"Just like the next girl, I am finding Ruby Rose to be the sexiest genderfluid being to have graced my eyeballs. But is anyone else bothered by an endless barrage of social media posts by ""straight"" girls saying they'd ""turn gay"" for Ruby Rose or that she's ""turning"" them lesbian? People are so quick to trivialize same-sex attraction and automatically attribute it to the gorgeousness of someone like Ruby. But then again, I am biased as I'm in the ""let's stop erasing the identity because really aren't MOST of us humans bisexual???"" camp."
bisexual,3a3sc3,Chris770,2,Wed Jun 17 00:31:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's just a matter of people wording what they're trying to express clumsily. Ruby Rose is a breathtakingly beautiful person. I understand that many monosexual people have that singular incongruous crush in their lives, and there's no way I could blame anyone if theirs happened to be Ruby Rose. I also think it's wonderful that people are willing to openly acknowledge that. The problem is that most of the people saying this just aren't familiar with the terminology to express what they're trying to say in a fully coherent fashion, and they likely aren't fully familiar with the concept of genderfluidity, if at all.  So on one hand, I consider it a better thing for people to be able to acknowledge that these sorts of crushes occasionally occur, and it's preferable for people to be aware of it rather than having monosexual people constantly get confused about it. (""The fact that you find one guy in all of creation appealing makes you nothing but human, stop stressing out about it."")  On the other hand, it would be nice if people in general were more aware of certain concepts, to the point where they could express what they're trying to say without sounding a bit silly. I'm not so much offended by this as just very mildly exasperated, however.  *Punctuation"
bisexual,3a3sc3,Antheral,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:36:09 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. I'm just obviously more irritated than you and maybe others for the following reasons:   (a) While it could be considered a perk that women are more freely allowed to express same-sex attraction than men, this is because women's sexuality, especially same-sex attraction, has historically been under-examined and trivialized, unlike men's same-sex attraction. For example, the idea that men would pretend to be gay for attention is pretty rare, but people constantly question women's attraction to other women, especially if they're femme women, all the time. Also, women's sexuality is often framed in the context of (straight) men's desires, so it's more acceptable for girl-on-girl action because straight men find it hot, but not because they take it seriously.  (b) While our research on bisexuality is sparse, the word/term/concept isn't THAT new. It is LGBT after all, and has been for a long time. While I don't expect rando straight people in my life to understand the basics of gender and sexual fluidity (an expectation that at least for me is rapidly changing to the times), I'd at least expect them to know the word bisexuality, which has been around for a long time.  (c) Maybe I am in general less likely to cut ignorant people slack in my life than other queer folk. I certainly just don't think ignorance, especially in these changing times, is a great excuse for anyone. I think this comes from being a person with many intersecting marginalized identities. I'm just tired, yo."

It was making me miserable, even after I came to the same conclusions /u/Jakethesnake98 offered.  A little later, I realized that for me, it simply wasn't worth being miserable anymore.  I can't change it, so why fight it even if my upbringing said it is wrong?  It doesn't affect anyone else, it doesn't harm anyone, and I realized there was an entire community of good people out there that I had/could be a part of.  I came to terms with it and I felt much happier about that.  If you come to terms with it, that doesn't mean you have to come out to everyone either.  Many people are quite contempt not having anyone know, because they have come to terms with their own conscience.    Like others said, it's not going to go to way.  I/we didn't sign up for it, we didn't volunteer for it.  We are just bisexual and that is that.  All you can do is try to fight/ignore it, but I have never heard of a story where that worked/led to more happiness.  That's what I originally tried to do, but no matter how hard I tried, it always crept back to the front of my mind.    Don't feel betrayed.  You are a unique individual.  Your sexuality is just one aspect of your life, not your entire being.  It doesn't make you a bad person, it doesn't make you a sinner, and it doesn't make you evil or unholy.  I say in terms of living a good and sin-free life, as long as you are trying to make the world a better place, and are being a good person to others, you should be all set."

If not, then you're just as human as anyone else, and as such, you're just as likely as anyone else is to be bisexual. Be glad you weren't born with horrible birth defects, because you could really be in a much worse situation. Seriously, be grateful that you have a life that's otherwise O.K.  If you feel a sense of punishment, it's self-inflicted. You've lived your life in a community that reviles differing sexual orientations (and probably sexual activity in general, from my own observations). That environment undoubtedly shaped your personal opinions on the matter. If you had grown up somewhere more accepting, you most likely wouldn't have such a difficult time coming to terms with yourself. Your current environment is not a healthy one.  If your community is dangerous for LGBT people, you really only have two options. The first is to leave to some place that has a more accepting attitude, so you can live free of the fear that your community might one day turn on you. The second is to remain, live a lie that denies your attraction to other women, and run the risk the consequences of your community discovering the truth.  I know this isn't an easy decision. It's definitely not fair that you should have to either deny a significant facet of your personality or leave your home and those you love. However, the longer you remain in this bigoted community, the greater the risk that someone discovers the truth, and the greater the risk that this truth will cause you grief and suffering. The sooner you flee from this oppressive environment, the sooner you can be yourself.  I won't push you to pursue a relationship with another woman, but if you leave your community for somewhere better, you'd be free to do so without fear of reprisal. Leaving is definitely the best choice, even though it might seem monumentally frightening."
bisexual,3a3055,grizzfan,5,Wed Jun 17 15:14:54 2015 UTC,"There's no way to make attraction go away, but you can choose who you date. If you think dating women will put you in danger, or you just don't want to, that's totally your choice and you can keep on rocking with the men. However, if you think dating women will make you happier, or more fulfilled, then I think coming out, or even trying out a few dates with women might be something to consider. Being queer in an intensely religious environment is super scary and awful, and I know because I speak from experience. However, you can't change who you are, so you might as well love yourself. Only dating men doesn't make you any less bisexual, and avoiding women doesn't make you less bisexual, so might as well embrace who you are, whatever that means to you.   Another option is to get away from your ISIS-like community. Any community that doesn't accept you for who you are isn't a community that's worth your time. It might be amazing to meet other queer people, and hear their experiences, and actually be accepted for who you are. Who knows? Maybe you'll even really like being bisexual?

Is a bisexual who has dated men and women romantically more bisexual than someone who identifies as bisexual, but has only dated one or the other?  (Or neither?)  This also somewhat leads into some uncomfortable issues in the politics of bisexuality, too. The ""barsexual"" issue in particular for women, and those individuals (particularly gay men) who might use bisexuality as a ""transitional"" identity.

First of all there is the umbrella definition: being sexually and/or romantically attracted to more than one gender. And then there is the personal definition. Because with this definition it is obvious that bisexuality is a range. It ranges from being attracted to men and women to being attracted to all the different kinds of genders. It also ranges from gender expression not playing an important role in the attraction to gender expression being very important. There are people who have an equal romantic and sexual attraction, but most people have differences in these area's. So the personal definition of bisexuality can be véry specific."

Tell her you told her your orientation in confidence, and you're hurt that, not only is she talking about it with others, but she's misrepresenting it.   If it comes up with mutual friends, tell them you're bi (or not gay, if that's easier), tell them you've asked her to stop and you would appreciate it if they would correct her.   Tell her it's not right for her to ask you to ""act gay"". You're not gay,  and a straight person telling you to ""act gay"" is exploitative and homophobic, and therefore unacceptable.

I like your FWB emphasis on friend line cause I feel the same way. I would encourage you to not give up. Go to lesbian bars, talk to lots of women, if nothing else you could at least meet some new friends and like-minded people. Good luck.  Edit: also I totally understand your desire to be around like-minded people. This subreddit and r/actuallesbians are good for that. That's why I use them. :)"

I'll check around though. I'll be going to grad school in a bigger city so maybe there will be people there who I can talk to."
bisexual,39zi40,thornsandroses,2,Tue Jun 16 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"I identified as bi for a very long time and ran into some of the same  issues.  My frustration lead me to create a bisexual woman's group. I posted an ad on craigslist and held the first meeting in my home.  7 people showed up to the first meeting and 13 the next week. It continued to grow online after we set up a website and message board and it eventually became a great resource for locals.   It really wasn't that hard to do and before the first meeting I already had two women contact me who wanted to help, which made things much easier. If there isn't a group already in your area, start one!"

One of the first attendees knew of a coffee shop that ended up offering meeting space in the early days though we quickly outgrew it and had to find another place after a month. I got a lot of interest right away and we continued to post ads on craigslist to continue to generate interest and recruit new people.   I would try googling lgbt and your town to find your local resources. If your are interested in starting your own group I can help with guidance and research.

bisexual,39zi40,Gallifreyan_fez,4,Tue Jun 16 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"I also feel the same way, though I have more experience pre-marriage, and honestly I found it just as hard when I was single to differentiate women that were actually interested and women that were just being affectionate friends. Sorry to hear that people have been duping you though, the internet can really suck. However, you mention grad school, most universities have LGBT societies which organise events. I found the one at my uni was pretty proactive and I met some people through that that became friends, and then through them I started to meet more people with more bisexual tendencies. So grad school could be a great place to start, the fact that you are likely to be there for a certain amount of time allows you to get to know people better as friends too, so that could be what you're looking for. Bars can be enjoyable but it is a bit nervewracking to be there on your own without likeminded friends. Also I have the same reservation as you as I've met a few lesbian women who haven't understood why I like men as well or worse have said that bisexuality 'is just having your cake and eating it too' and it's not actually a thing, or have said some fairly misandrist stuff that put me off, particularly as I've never really been comfortable identifying as female myself. All of this can make it awkward, as can hitting on a very affectionate woman friend and watching her be like 'oh, no, I'm not like that' (sigh). I too would prefer to meet more openly bi people. Unfortunately it seems fairly common for bi people to not be quite so open with their identities, probably in large part due to the tendency of people to see a man/woman couple and assume both partners are straight :/. Good luck in your search though, hope it proves more fruitful in future."

I will keep looking though, I am sure it is there.   I've never been much of a bar person, especially on my own. I really only have 2 close girl friends but only one I think would accompany me as perhaps a winglady! :) Though, she'd probably have more luck than me and as far as I know, she's completely straight!  I've been taking a ""If it happens, it happens"" stance on this whole thing but I feel that if I just leave it to that, it's never going to happen. But, if I try and fail over and over again..well, that sucks too. I'll keep going and try to be positive. Thanks again for sharing!"
bisexual,39zi40,Hard4Dpp,3,Tue Jun 16 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"I completely understand your frustration, and online dating can be such a pain in the ass. You have to sort through a bunch of crap to find the good people.   However, you have to understand that your search is going to be hard. Looking for NSA sex with a woman is not as easy as it is with a man. You are upfront about being married (good!) and so any woman looking for a romantic/sexual relationship is going to be aware that they will always be number two. They know that even if you fall in love, it can't become more. They know that you have responsibilities that supersede them.   That's not appealing to everyone.   You're likely better off to search out poly or swinger communities and try to find someone in a similar situation to you (coupled up, wanting to explore). That way, everyone understands and people are less likely to wind up with hurt feelings."
bisexual,39ze7x,jonahfitx,6,Tue Jun 16 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"I am a 24 year old male who has had an identical experience to your own. My best friend of 6 years, I love him to death. He has always been the closest person in my life, we have lived together 4 years and even moved away from our hometown together him and I and I don't foresee our friendship ending sooner than the grave.  He was the first person I came out to as bi and he hugged me when I cried and has been the most supportive person in my adventure since. I have had a crush on him for 3 years and probably will forever, but he's definitely very straight. Exactly like yourself, he's not my physical type either but he's my emotional type. I have gotten jealous over him in the past and longed for him just like you when he was away for even a weekend. We experimented a little but ultimately he has no romantic feelings for men and over time I've come to accept that.  My best advice would be, if your friend is supportive enough, to talk to him about this but make it clear you have no desire to make unwanted advances towards him. See what he says and go from there. If he's not supportive enough, I would recommend being patient and maybe talk to someone else about this at least to help you get through these confusing times.  Needless to say, it ate me up pretty bad, my crush on my best friend. But talking to him and being patient and talking through it with other people ultimately helped me. And now I have a loving boyfriend whom I've been seeing for 4 months and it's not always just for sex (my first relationship with a man at that) and couldn't be happier.

As a gay person, I can tell you that we often wonder the same thing. The answer: yes. Think about all the male friends you've had in your life. How many of them were you attracted to? Assuming the answer isn't ""literally all of them,"" there you go: proof that you can have guy friends to whom you don't feel sexually or romantically attracted.   How could I have being such a good friend if I kept this from him?   I assume by ""this"" you mean ""coming out as bi."" But coming out to others is much different than coming out to yourself; both take courage, but they don't always happen at the same time. You haven't been maliciously keeping a secret from him and him alone; you simply haven't yet shared with him something you haven't yet shared with anyone.   I'd suggest coming out to him when you feel ready. I wouldn't immediately follow up that up by saying you've been crushing on him. He's your best friend with whom you feel (among other things) emotional intimacy, so he seems like the best person in your life to talk about your sexuality with."

It went like this:  Me: ...So...I have something really important and difficult to tell you...something I've wanted to say for a long time...  Dad: Oh, god...don't tell me you have a boyfriend...  It just flew over his head, especially since I never exactly hid being bi. I couldn't stop laughing though."

Pb: so you aren't going to have a girlfriend too, just a boyfriend?  Me: you mean have both at the same time?....  Pb: yeah isn't that what bi sexuals do?

bisexual,39y0k6,PoseidonOfTheSea,10,Tue Jun 16 11:16:26 2015 UTC,"Along those lines... I was in Science Olympiad in high school. A giant group of nerds. One of the guys came up with ""The Lightsaber Challenge"". The way it works is you tell a guy to imagine that he'd get a real life lightsaber if he had gay sex. It could be with any man, dead or alive, celebrity, etc. If he topped, he'd get a purple lightsaber. If he bottomed, a lightsaber of any color of his choice. If he tried both, either a double ended lightsaber or two lightsabers in the color of his choice. One guy suggested extending it to ""well what if you suck a guy's dick?"" Apparently you get a blaster. The question ""what if a guy sucks your dick?"" came up and was answered with ""You'd probably get the best blowjob of your life. That's your prize."" They would randomly ask guys from other schools about their ""lightsaber challenge"" and it got to the point where any guy who said he didn't want a lightsaber was a killjoy and no fun, even if he came from a school in the middle of a midwestern cornfield. So all the guys had a ""lightsaber guy"" or a ""blaster guy"" or both, lol. A lot said ""Fuck yeah, I'll top a guy and be Mace Windu!"" But it was interesting when one of the most popular guys in my high school thought about it for a little while and said he wouldn't mind bottoming for a good looking guy as long as it was slow and sweet- lightsaber or not. The whole cafeteria suddenly got quiet and everybody stared at Scott (who is currently, 7 years after this happened, engaged to a woman, I might add)- then the guys started chattering about it and having serious discussions about the matter. It was very odd, lol."

I occasionally look at lesbian stuff and some others. I can only seem to want sex with her about once a month or once every other month. Our relationship is pretty great. I enjoy doing life with her.   It's just not fair to either of us is all. I'm only speaking for myself and my experiences.   She told me she does have a couple work friends she's talking to about this, which I was relieved to hear. I just have been through so much mental anguish over the last 15+ years alone, and I can't imagine anyone I love having to deal with this alone."

bisexual,3a0b22,supertman71,4,Tue Jun 16 05:48:25 2015 UTC,"Bi trans guy here! One of the biggest issues is: How far do you want to take this? I'm basically at the other end of the spectrum of bisexuality than you are. I'm homoromantic and bisexual. This obviously leads to an overwhelming amount of men and not women in my dating past, though I have enjoyed playing around with all the genders :) If you're just looking for sex, let me say this: You do not have to limit yourself to bisexual men. (To anyone reading this: This is in no way discouraging bisexuality. This is just part of the transgender experience.) There are gay men who absolutely enjoy trans men. Being gay, believe it or not, is not all about dick. It's about who you want to date and who you want to come home to, it's about kissing a guy with stubble and not a girl with lip gloss. It's many things. There are gay men out there who actually particularly enjoy trans men. The chaser culture isn't nearly as prevalent in gay culture as it is for trans women, so you'll be able to weed out the exploitative people really quickly.  If you're just looking to hook up, Grindr is where it is at. Be up front on your profile about your trans status, what you will and won't do, etc. Guys will be interested. If you're willing to bottom using both holes, or even just your front hole?  Looots of gay and bi men into that. There are other gay guys who would enjoy a mutual bj, or even less. There are gay and bi guys who would enjoy bottoming for you with a prosthetic. There is no limits.  If you're looking to date? Grindr is cool for that too. Also join LGBTQIA+ clubs near you. Go out to gay bars and just socialize without expectations. Meet gay and bisexual men via online dating services like OK Cupid."

I'll probably start out with sex first and if I can see myself become more serious then I'll go the dating route. I really hope that doesn't make me sound like a shallow ass hole.

You're perfectly entitled to have sex with guys before you even begin figuring out if you could date them! A lot of bi guys are this way as well, where they only have sex with dudes. Sometimes that never changes, and sometimes they find they can fall in love with men too. It's completely up to you and how you feel if you wanna make that call.  What do you feel like you wanna do with guys? Have you ever experienced being penetrated before? Do you wanna do the penetrating? Feel free to ask away here or in PM if you want, and I'll be as graphic as you need me to be if you have questions. :P"

Eheheheheheh...if you're into this, have you possibly thought about a threesome with two guys? I've done DP this way before and it's damn fun. It was really awesome to be the center of attention in that way as well.   (I'd only be nervous about doing in the ass with a guy because of what could come out...).   Don't worry about this. If you haven't learned already, go mosey on over to /r/Sex and check out the anal sex portion of the FAQ. Read up on anal douching. Simply buying a small douching bulb and filling it with lukewarm water and giving yourself a small squirt (after you've gone to the bathroom and had a recent bowel movement ideally, that way you'll know you aren't due for another for at least a couple hours) will keep you squeaky clean. Also, in the small likelihood that some tiny brown smear does happen? It's no big deal, seriously. Since you're into anal play already I'm sure you've got a handle on how your own ass works in that department. Gay and bi tops are already well-versed in the dangers of anal sex, and to be honest most guys are really appreciative if you take the time to anal douche beforehand. You'll feel better and more confident, and so will they. (Eventually you'll probably realize that this isn't even necessary preparation, but for now comfort is key. :3)   I have a strong desire to give a guy a hand job and blow job... Especially the later. I want to know what it's like to have a guy come in my mouth and come on me.   It can be really hot! If you're into it of course. :) It sounds like you know you will be.   And I think once I get used to the idea of being with a guy then is want to date one...   Maybe you will! Maybe you won't. Maybe you'll love the sex but opt out of relationships. Maybe you'll not love the sex as much but enjoy the camaraderie. It's all up to how you feel.   But my family also complicates matters because I've only ever dated girls since I was 16 and I'm almost 20 and my mom this whole time has been fighting and hinting to have me try dating guys and I don't want her to think I'm ""coming back to the right path"" because I'm dating guys, cause I'm not going to stop my transition. It's all kinds of complicated.    Question, if you don't mind me asking: How far along are you into your transition? Because if you got a boyfriend, odds are the outside world is going to see two men together, regardless of whatever antiquated gender notions your mom might be holding onto. (I totally get it, my family wasn't exactly thrilled about my transition either at first.) I think she might see you two together and realize that her ""daughter"" is really a man. The world wouldn't see you as a woman. In the end it might end up being more eye opening than if it were a new girlfriend you brought home. She might still be stuck thinking of you as a ""lesbian"", even though you're a man."

Now the fiancé has asked that we discontinue playing with others, because she wants more of us time [we don't get that much as it is anymore and she wants that time to be exclusive, which I am fine with], but it is still nice to know that there is zero judgement regarding my sexual thirsts.

bisexual,39x1l6,helloiamsilver,4,Mon Jun 15 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"""why do you even need labels"" is something I use to think. I never SAID it to anybody back then but I use to wonder why it was needed. Just be yourself right? The rest doesn't matter.  But it does. So much. Or it can rather. It doesn't matter to everyone I suppose.  But when I released I was Bi the struggle was difficult. The thought of bisexuality didn't even occur to me. In part because I am more attracted to women then men. I always had thought it had to be a all or 50/50 sort of thing. Even though I have a bi friend who told me for her it was a ""mood"" sort of thing for her. It didn't really click.  Saying ""I'll just be me"" helps a lot. But having that word, weather it's Bisexual or Pansexual, or Gay, or queer or trans. Whatever word that describes YOU, well it makes such a difference.  For me when I was able to tell myself ""I'm bisexual"" a weight lifted off my shoulders. Literally I had massive lumps of stress built up, and they melted away.    But other then that it's a for the lack of a better term ""normalizes"" you. It says you aren't something that is wrong. You are ok being you. It's perfectly fine, you are this thing and it is apart of your definition now. You aren't an unknown or a strange anomaly. You aren't alone in what you are.   It feels weird saying this because I have no idea of other people find these terms so important to them. And I personally am more attracted to women then I am men and the margin is not close. Sometimes I worry that is wrong and saying I am Bi isn't quite right, but It's not a term I would give up lightly because that is what feels right when I think it. If it didn't fit me I know I would feel so very alone again.   So at least that is my experience with these terms. They can help validate you and that is why you need them."

bisexual,39wpup,cripplesmith,2,Tue Jun 16 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"What I've noticed that seems to be the most characteristic of bi culture--and yeah, this is sad, especially since gay culture has so many actual signifiers--is simply shared oppression. A lot of bi people have gone through similar experiences which felt isolating, and society in general keeps up these bad messages, and bisexual culture is really just bisexuals banding together and saying to each other ""yeah, that's my experience too"" and ""you're not alone"" and ""you're perfect how you are."" Basically, what seems to sum up bi culture for me is a culture that celebrates bisexuality. Less cultural markers than the gays for sure, unfortunately…but I'm hopeful that we'll get our own with time. I think it'll happen.   Also it's a joke that bisexuals love puns (usually with the prefix ""bi""), but I'm not a fan… you can only see ""Bi the way"" used to refer to about half the things in the possibly bisexual universe before it gets old!"
bisexual,39wj30,NewYiffer54,2,Mon Jun 15 11:16:52 2015 UTC,Does this make you Bi... It's your call at the end of the day. There are people who identify as straight who like everything you just described (and people who are Bi or Gay). All you have to do is choose a label (if you want one) that most accurately describes your attractions. At the end of the day only you can know for sure :)
bisexual,39wj30,Evil_Eyes,2,Mon Jun 15 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"I've only recently started focusing on the type of guy that I'm (male) attracted to and it's normally the femme types. I'm definitely not into the butch, muscled types but I still think I'm pretty fucking bi. But then again, like Evil_Eyes said, you don't actually need a label. You like who you like, and at the end of the day who should it really matter to except yourself?"

And I really didn't know who to watch the 2 guys or the girl and guy it just kinda makes me awkward but I still got off at the girl pegging the guy....I'm sorry to go all NSFW..but I just don't think I can talk to my gf about this stuff.. you guys help out alot.
bisexual,39wj30,Evil_Eyes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"Well, Bisexuals don't watch Bisexual porn exclusively.. I don't, and most other people I've asked think its kinda crap.. haha! Gay or straight porn is much better, and bisexuality isn't about just having both at the same time.  I know its really horrible feeling confused, but just relax a little and take the time to look around/explore as you have been doing. After a while you'll start to settle on an understanding of what you are and are not interested in. It often takes time so don't get too frustrated :)"

bisexual,39vdzt,untidyvetstudent,3,Mon Jun 15 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"I've had a very similar experience. Last year (at age 19), I discovered my attraction for men and non-binary folk (I'm a man) very suddenly. It almost felt like a light switch went off. It's totally possible for same gender attraction to seemingly appear out of nowhere. It was very jarring, but I have come to accept myself as queer/pan. As I look back on my life, I continue to remember little hints or moments from when I was younger that show that I was a closeted queer without being aware of it. Or you could just have a fluid sexuality.  I think that it's incredibly important not to underestimate the impact of heteronormativity. Heternormativity has a massive gravity that greatly influences how our sexuality is expressed. As a woman, your attraction to men is given a platform and is supported, while your attraction to anyone else is repressed by hetero structures and institutions. Our society does not give an outlet for same gender attraction, so it's quite easy to convince yourself that you don't experience it. I played football before I came to realize I was queer, and I think that football played a big role in socializing me as straight, when really I could never assimilate into that culture."
bisexual,39vdzt,Blackbelt54,2,Mon Jun 15 04:36:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story, it's good to know I'm not alone. And I think you're right,  just without really being exposed to LGBTQ stuff and being attracted to guys,  heteronormativity (new word for me :p ) probably influenced me to just not know myself because it wasn't something i had to confront.  Just a whole load of stuff about sexuality I didn't know before this realisation."
bisexual,39vdzt,Blackbelt54,2,Mon Jun 15 09:46:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah especially for bi/pan people, it's difficult because we do experience attraction to the opposite gender, so it's very easy to just assume we're straight. I also had trouble with confusion and it took me a long time to not doubt my sexuality (sometimes, I still do). If you want to talk through any of this stuff feel free to PM me, I know it can be hard"
bisexual,39vdzt,hyzenthlay1701,2,Mon Jun 15 13:35:04 2015 UTC,"(32 woman)  You're not alone!  I didn't figure out I wasn't straight till after I hit 30!  And yes, it was a very headspinning process figuring it out.  I can list many things that made it difficult to see, chief among them being that I'm demisexual and highly introverted.  A very conservative upbringing and some impressive mental contortions (""I...want to BE her.  Yep, that's it."") did not help.  But once I figured it out, so many pieces of my life suddenly snapped into focus.  I'm glad to hear you're happy with who you are: that's more important than anything.  My advice would be to give it time and remember (1) nothing about you has actually changed.  It's weird to realize that you may fall into a different category than you thought, but it's all just words.  You're still you!  Well, one thing HAS changed: you know yourself better now than you did before, and that's a good thing.  (2) You do not need to define yourself with respect to anyone else.  In other words, just because you read something that another bi person wrote and it doesn't match your experiences, it doesn't mean you're not bi; it means there are many ways to be bi.  Diversity is awesome.  For me, doubt was normal.  It still is sometimes.  I feel like I lived as a horse my whole life and then one day found a horn on my head--wtf is that?!  It's hard to shake the worry that someday I'll paw around for that horn and find out it's not there anymore and everyone will call me a liar.  But every day that goes by and I check for it--yep, still there--it becomes a little easier to be sure of myself.  Because I'm with a guy, I look straight.  Because I've never been with a woman, there are many people who'd say I don't count.  But I know what I am.  And I'm happy."
bisexual,39vdzt,hyzenthlay1701,2,Mon Jun 15 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you, just knowing there are other people like me helps,  it was scary to have such a paradigm shift in the way I see myself and other people, and like you said it makes you doubt yourself too, especially when it is such a recent realisation. And learning a lot I wish was taught at school or something, about sexuality in general from trying to understand my feelings. How did you decide how to come out to who?"
bisexual,39vdzt,girlboygirlboy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:39:33 2015 UTC,"How did you decide how to come out to who?   I'm actually still in the process of coming out.  I'm fortunate in that I have a supportive husband: there was no specific ""coming out"" to him because he helped me figure it out to start with.  Then I sat on the information for about the year: reading, thinking, just generally getting comfortable in my new skin.  Then I told a small handful of family members that I knew would be supportive plus some bi/pan internet friends, and they were amazing.  I chose not to tell my parents, at least not for now: my father is extremely LGBT-phobic, and I'm not ready for that drama.  I've also chosen to remain quiet on facebook for now because I live in rural southeastern US, and I could lose my job.  Not the bravest course of action, but there's no rush.  Being bi doesn't actually change much about my life, but I feel that it's important to say something to help overcome stereotypes, and it feels really, really good to have your friends accept you for who you are.  However, always remember that it's your choice: giving someone the keys to your inner self is a privilege, and you're not obligated to do so for someone who's going to be an ass."
bisexual,39vdzt,Liadan,2,Mon Jun 15 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"Your husband sounds great :) but it sucks that where you live not everyone is accepting. I guess I'm lucky that I think most of my friends would be supportive and quite a few of them are LGBT. Not so sure about telling my family/ parents or some less discrete friends, but I don't have to tell them unless i meet the right person and that person happens to be a girl.I think bar close friends, I'm going to keep it to myself, at least till I figure out where I am a little more. Thanks, you're right, it doesn't change anything else about me and I don't have to tell everyone something so personal if I'm not comfortable."

bisexual,39uekg,kaichai,2,Sun Jun 14 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, that may be true... The funny thing is that young-looking or ""feminine"" men also tend to find me attractive (which is exactly what I find attractive!).  I also feel like it is easier to kind of ""connect"" with boys and make conversation. Maybe it's also because I'm quite shy and a rather introvert person?"
bisexual,39uekg,LordHal,6,Sun Jun 14 23:06:51 2015 UTC,"Another side of it might simply be that as a man, you recognise the things a man does when he's interested more easily than you recognise the things a woman does in the same situation. Glad things went well for you."
bisexual,39uekg,kaichai,3,Sun Jun 14 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe! If talking to women in a ""special"" way has been emphasized for you (such as having to always be suave, or impressive, etc) then it would make a lot of sense to find it easier to chat up men."

How old were you when you got into porn, why did you chose it, and how did it affect relationships with your relatives, family, etc.  Did you have any experience doing straight porn, would you do straight porn had you had the option.  And finally, what kinds of porn did you perform, and what were your favorites to do on camera.  Thank you for this AMA."

Well, maybe 15 almost 16.  But no one asked. I looked young. But I had a big dick.  how did it affect relationships with your relatives  only relatives I knew as an uncle. I fucked his stepson a lot. I have not heard hide nor hair of them in years. Last I heard the kid was strung out on meth.  Sorta a shame.   Did you have any experience doing straight porn  There was a client of the guy taking the pictures who had a lady who as into young guys.  I did a couple of girls, then she wanted the gay scene more often.  Never knew who she was but I was told she was a biggy big.  She seemed to have money and paid for gigs.   And finally, what kinds of porn did you perform  Lots of beach stuff and stuff on boats. Young guys like myself. Standard beginning. Tight 501's, tank tops. Piling into a boat or getting ready to surf.  Few lead ins with jeans only. Then the fun began, as we called it, and we fucked ourselves raw.  what were your favorites to do on camera  My tastes ran 1 on 2.  Guys my age, (18-19) blond surfer types. No femme. Just good old fashioned fucking sex.   Swap ends and swap sides."

bisexual,39ta3c,Antheral,7,Sun Jun 14 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"The pay?  At 16?  the pay was a place to stay, meals, friends and  being stupid.  Yeah later on there was bucks. A few. But mainly we all were just dumb and dumber.    I guess exploited?  But hella fun.   Older guys would take us on trips. Spend a shit load of cash on hotels.  We got to see Hawaii and Central America.  As a kid you are more impressed with being hauled around than knowing you could make lots of money  Yeah we had money. Couple of hundred here. If I needed more I just asked. They gave us money but not in the true sense,  You get out because you grow old. Basically  you are used up at 25 or so.  Sure there are those into daddy roles. Few and far inbetween.    For lack of better terminology, porn is good for about 5 years,. you are washed up at 25."

bisexual,39uryy,tempora_mutantur,13,Sun Jun 14 23:30:59 2015 UTC,"I mean yeh. Two ways you can subdivide bisexuals further is expressly sexual orientation and romantic orientation. It's not uncommon for some of us to be sexually attracted to both sexes but not both romantically, or the other way around.  Probably the biggest issue that will be on her mind as a bi girl dating a guy is that if she's open about it, a lot of people will question her legitimacy. There's a perception about of girls who'll hook up with each other at parties for a laugh and call themselves bisexuals.  I wouldn't feel too bad about feeling ignorant, you've acknowledged it. Just ask her about what it means to her. If nothing else it'll show you're considerate."
bisexual,39uryy,ArgyleMK,5,Mon Jun 15 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like she is bisexual but heteroromantic. Romantic orientation and sexual orientation can be different or even opposing in rare cases (like, opposing as is being homosexual heteroromantic or heterosexual homoromantic). I think you'll find that a lot of people have differing sexual/romo orientations though, that's fairly common. There are  probably a lot of forum posts and stuff about dating people who are a different sexuality. A quick google search will help. Try sites like EmptyClosets. The pitting of minority groups against other minority groups. Outsiders tend to put one group on a pedestal (such as the effeminate gay white man, like 'Cam' from Modern Family- you see that on TV a lot more than a POC transwoman, like 'Sophia' from Orange Is the New Black. Also, bisexual people and pansexual people tend to be pitted against each other for some reason- sometimes, bi people are said to be 'transphobic' because they are 'not attracted to people outside the gender binary'- so, not attracted to trans people, genderfluid people, genderqueer people, agender people, etc. and this is also not always true. Pan people are put on a pedestal for 'not being transphobic'. But, in saying this, bisexuality is a much more widely known and probably more accepted sexuality for someone to be, and what tends to happen is a lot of pansexual people end up saying they are bi so they don't have to a) explain what pansexuality is, and b) have to deal with people telling them their sexuality is not real. To be honest, I think you should be asking yourself a lot of questions. Things like about why you feel uncomfortable about her sleeping with more girls than you (or, so she says wink). I'm not trying to take a dig at you, don't get me wrong. But, if you feel uncomfortable with it... why? Is it an insecurity within yourself, thinking that you can't get as many girls as her? Is it fear that she likes girls more, and will cheat on you with one? Or leave you for one? If it is any of these things, think it through, because I can guarantee three things.   a) You got her. So, obviously it's nothing wrong with you.  b) If she is going to cheat, she is going to cheat. But that fact that she would cheat has nothing to do with her bisexuality. Straight people cheat all the time. Its something that happens. I'm not condoning it happening, but it does, and it doesn't have anything to do with who she likes or doesn't like gender-wise.  c) Same as above. If she is going to leave you, it would probably not be a snap decision, anyway.  BUT, I highly doubt any of these things will happen. And, if your discomfort comes from the fact that she is bi... maybe end the relationship now, because it will bite you in the ass later, and it will hurt her a lot more than you.  P.S.: Keep communication open. Don't clam up because you're afraid of something, or uncomfortable with something, or anything like that. Talk to her- she's your girlfriend! Ask her these things, because ultimately she is going to be the one that matters.  Good luck! :)"
bisexual,39uryy,ivene-adlev,5,Mon Jun 15 05:59:44 2015 UTC,"First, thank you for being so open about this and trying to learn more.  Society would be a lot happier with more people like you!   From my reading, yes, this is absolutely a thing.  I have no idea how common it is.  Even basic statistics on bisexuals are hard to come by, so finding numbers for something like that will be damn near impossible.  Technically, it makes her bisexual and heteroromantic.  Your sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with; your romantic orientation is who you want to hold hands with.  For those of us that have matching sexual and romantic orientations, it's a weird thing to get our head around that some people aren't wired that way, but it absolutely exists. This is my favorite FAQ website on bisexuality: bisexual.org/qna_categories/bisexuals/ It addresses bisexuality from many directions, including people who are monogamous and those who aren't.  Some of the questions are even answered by people who are in relationships with hetero partners.   Dating someone who's bi isn't really any different from dating someone who's hetero.  It's two people who are sexually compatible, falling in love.  If you're both blonde, who cares if one of you likes blondes + brunettes and the other only likes blondes?  It's probably a good idea to ask what her views on polyamory/open relationships are, but that's something you should ask ANY partner.  The big thing I'd caution is to remember that everyone is different, so don't assume that just because you read something about one bisexual that it will apply to your girlfriend.  Imagine if she tried to research what a ""typical"" hetero person wants in order to make you happy!  Research is a great way to start, but there's no substitute for just talking to her and asking.  Best of luck!"
bisexual,39uryy,hyzenthlay1701,5,Mon Jun 15 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's common or not, but it's not rare. I think it'd be called homoromantic/bisexualromantic, or something to that end. I don't have any, and I doubt there will be anything. It's just a relationship. Sometimes, they may ask for some sort of polyamory, but definitely not all. And, remember, if she cheats, it is NOT because she's bi. It's because she's a twat."
bisexual,39uryy,IrishCynic,2,Mon Jun 15 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"Might I suggest asking these questions of your girlfriend? It should, if anything, show her that you're interested in her life and aren't likely to bust out some homophobic shit."

bisexual,39rf0d,LordHal,2,Sun Jun 14 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"like on the one hand I get that, but even the subtext in your reply suggests that the idea of bisexuals being confused is less a part of the identity and more of an unfortunate stigma"

bisexual,39s7nn,phobos512,4,Sun Jun 14 06:27:33 2015 UTC,"I learned something today that I wanted to share with you all.  When I was in college I was out and proud.  I knew I was gay and that was that.  Then I fell in love with a woman and thought maybe that wasn't that.  Since then, and this is nearly 13 years, I've dated men and women, and I've been single, but I've identified as bi.  I've been in and out of the ""scene"".  I've felt good and bad about myself, and I've been warm and cold when it comes to wanting friends.    Today I went to DC Pride and I feel like I recharged my batteries.  I've been neglecting a part of myself that used to be very important, and this subreddit and the people I've met through it have, really, brought me back to life.  So thanks.  And let your flag, freak or otherwise, fly."
bisexual,39s7nn,SlipspaceRupture01,2,Sun Jun 14 06:27:46 2015 UTC,Very inspirational speech. Is that you holding the flag in the photo?

bisexual,39s7nn,SlipspaceRupture01,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:45:26 2015 UTC,I think it's great that bisexuals are going to these events. It's easy to see yourself as not being a true gay because you have an attraction to the opposite sex. I'm glad these people think otherwise!
bisexual,39sewu,2310923,5,Sun Jun 14 08:31:41 2015 UTC,First time is always a little weird I think. I urge you to keep exploring (safely).
bisexual,39sewu,clementh,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:36:11 2015 UTC,Wanna crosspost this on /r/bibros? I think there'd be a number of people there with similar feelings or experiences.
bisexual,39sewu,twiggy_trippit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:35:39 2015 UTC,I gave my first one (and which is to date my only one) when I was 15. It was a guy in the same class as me and we'd been friends. I liked it a lot but afterwards we never spoke again. EVER. It was awkward AS FUCK. I had a similar experience that I wasn't really turned on while it happened but afterwards while walking home I was extremely turned on and the memory still gets me going 6 years later.
bisexual,39serf,nautiske,8,Sun Jun 14 08:28:29 2015 UTC,"I resonate with so much of this!! I have very, very recently realized that I'm doing the same thing to myself. I've never had a same-sex experience and because of that I am scared to tell people I'm bisexual for fear they won't believe me. But I know who I am and I need to be proud of that. I am also going to pride this year to try to fully embrace who I am and recently put a bi pride sticker on the back of my phone. This is me and I should be proud of that!   Congrats to you!! This has inspired me even more to embrace who I am, thanks so much for this post."
bisexual,39serf,jessiespano2,3,Sun Jun 14 16:22:41 2015 UTC,"It's so awesome that this helped you, and I'm really glad! :D It's great that you're putting a bi pride sticker on your phone, I've been to pride before but presented as just homosexual (as in, rainbow flags and outfit, describing myself as 'gay' when asked, etc). I think it will feel so much better when I can actually be myself.  Your comment has made me really happy and I'll definitely think of it whenever I'm struggling to express myself for who I am. Thank you, and good luck!"
bisexual,39serf,SlipspaceRupture01,6,Sun Jun 14 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"Glad to see that you were able to overcome it. My bi-phobia was different. I never felt like I was gay and that I didn't belong with that group, but I felt the same way with straight people too. For a while I felt like I was on my own and that people would never understand me. I'm starting to get over that way of thinking though."
bisexual,39serf,SlipspaceRupture01,3,Sun Jun 14 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"I've kind of felt that way in the past too. Descriptions like ""half-gay/half-straight"" always made me feel kind of insubstantial. I'm not half anything, I'm a whole person!  It's awesome that you're starting to get over that feeling. You're definitely not on your own, and I've started to discover that there are plenty of great bi communities around, both online and off, which really helped me to feel less weird about it."
bisexual,39serf,ScorpionBite20,2,Sun Jun 14 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"Well put, I think you explained better. I just hope that people see me as equal and not a person that's faking their sexuality.

bisexual,39pm99,Bi-Rancher-Calif,16,Sat Jun 13 17:32:50 2015 UTC,Metaphor. I'm not straight. I'm proabably a 2.5 on the Kinsey scale.   And it's not that I couldn't be happy with just him...I totally could. It's that we're both 19 and I don't think I'll be able to live without intimacy with girls. I'm sorry if that perpetuates any sort of stereotype.

bisexual,39pm99,artichokess,11,Sat Jun 13 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"Ok so now what. Ain't that big of a deal right?  The emotions? Gotta love society. You been programmed to the hilt to believe that as a straight guy you cannot have feelings for another male.  Well guess what....  Hey I taught high school for ten years. I worked for the greatest principal and superintendent on earth. (He got me to quit, attend law school then chase my dream to own a ranch).   When I was 28 he had an 18 year old son I was almost obsessed with,.  But I had a wife and kids.  No way would I ever dream.  Kick forward 30 years. My kid is having lasik surgery on his eyes so he can fly 787's for the majors.  The surgeon. Was the then 18 year old kid.  He's married with 5 of his own. We chatted as I paid the boys bill.  He confided that he thought I was the greatest guy on earth when he was 18. And said he used to J/O every night thinking about me.  I would of sold my pair to have had a night with him way back. But he was off limits.  And a ladies man. BMOC type.     I did not have the heart to tell him I was messing with his dad when I was a coach at the high school....  True story Jake.  Take what you got and run with it."
bisexual,39pm99,the_fella,8,Sat Jun 13 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Haha. Well, what I've learned from this experience is that I can absolutely adore girls and still be in love with a guy. I don't know what the future holds, but I'm glad I live in a time when I can explore both ""sides"" of myself without fear."
bisexual,39pm99,MURDERSMASH,6,Sat Jun 13 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"Be very thankful for what your last statement you made.  yes you do live in a time and era which you can be and explore. Do you realize how many guys have either killed themselves, or have been killed, or have been tossed from their homes by well meaning parents?  While I love being a 1950's model, (and baby of the year from the mid 1950's), I'd give none of that up for anything, but there are times I wished I was young again.  With today's technology.  And enlightened ways.   You know I hit my 40 year high school reunion.  I was contacted by an ex girlfriend who is married to one of the class biggest bullies.  He absolutely destroyed me in high school.   I probably still hold scars based upon his big fucking mouth.  So I went.  He was 400lbs of blubber, she was a 250 pound pig, their kids were either retarded, or in prison.  One of the other guys who I was attracted to but dumped me abruptly in Jr College....(probably was whispered to by the do-gooders), he also showed up.  Bald, with a warts on his neck.  I was disgusted with myself to even have thought he was decent looking way back when.  I did bang his sister in the back of my Mustang.  She was hot. And his mom was a MILF.   Another guy showed up with his wife.  This guy asked me to leave his home once way back when we were in Jr College.. All the guys were there when I drove down the canyon.  I saw them all there. I stopped to see what was up.  He waddled out and told me not to come to his house unless invited.  I seriously thought of killing myself from the shame and hurt that day.  Even to this day it brings a bit of rage to me. I learned he had testicular cancer... how funny.  Kick 40 years later. I have all my hair. I am still the 190 lb guy who I was in high school. I have more money than god. My kids are all either lawyers and airline pilots.   I lack for nothing except youthful looks I had when I was a kid.  The law of Thermodynamics is kicking in.   When I walked into the country club outside of Monterey California where the reunion was held. I could not believe I even for one moment took these fools seriously. But I did.   I met a few ex friends., I told one guy I always wanted to knock you on your ass for your gossip.   But I could tell life dealt him exactly what he deserved.  I got back into my life and left.   I laughed all the way home.   My border collie met me at the house when I got home. My horses were running up the driveway when I came in the gates. The house overlooks a canyon and a barren dry lake (California drought),  but a view to kill for, the workers were all out back taking care of things. My kids are successful, my mom is alive and happy, and life is good.  I am glad I changed my name.  I am glad I followed my dreams. I am glad I took chances. I am glad the good lord blessed me fully with health, looks, and a great family.  What I do with guys, or gals is only a very minute part of my life. And I appologize to no one.   Footnote:  Yesterday I went to town to check on some rentals. Across the street from a rental I saw a little brown head peek up over the brush. It was 105 degrees outside.  I walked over to find a very tired and hot Cocker Spaniel puppy. Close to death. Exposed to the heat. Hungry, thirsty and tired.   I scooped her up then took her back to the rental. She got a bath, a flea spray and a collar.  Wanna see her today?  http://tinypic.com/m/ivvkf6/1  5 years ago I had a guy stop me in town near a donut shop. I had noticed him as I drove up the street. From a distance he seemed pretty good looking. I actually did want a donut. I hung a Uturn in the F350. Went back to the donut shop.   He approached me. He asked for a ride. I gave him one up the road about 5 miles. Quickly I realized he was strung out on meth. At first I wanted him out of the truck.   He asked for help.  Consequently at that time I was having a 2400 sq ft mother in laws quarters built at the ranch for guests.  The contractor is an ex offender and ex drug users. I called him to see if he knew anyone who could help this man.   5 years later.  We are going to his Jr College graduation to see him graduate. He is heading to the university.  Yes, I'd still like to get laid.   But for the time being, I'll stick with the pool boy.....or at least today."

I know what you mean about the depression porn though. I'd get so wrapped up in making myself feel like shit that it turned into a vicious cycle and one day I woke up and realized that I had no idea why I was so depressed in the first place.

Most of my life I was convinced I was totally straight so I didn't suffer the way some LGBT folks do, being in the closet knowing it's a giant lie.   After a lot of soul searching later on I did realize I had at least two instances of homosexual contact/desire in my youth but I basically reinterpreted them away or suppressed the memory way in the back of my head.

So whether its good really depends on the people who have that threesome with you- is there good communication before and after?  Is everybody enthusiastic about it? If you do kink, are negotiations done?  In what relationship are the people towards you and each other?  Like iI read of enough cases where one part(often women :/) felt pressured or coerced, so its really important to look out for signs of hesitations, one sided negotiations, a power-differential thats rather noncon.. There are people who think they have to try this to ""save"" a relationship or a pair that wants to try nonmonogamy but not everybody wants it the same amount..  Sooo, like if you find someone, meet them before to a lunch or some low key non-comitted meeting to check whether you have chemistry- if you are unsure, DONT do it. If you experience strange interactions (like if one thinks they have to prove they arent jelous by being okay with a threesome but not really being okay with it..This can get complicated and stressful pretty qick.  So its not really thomething you just do.  Both threesomes i had werent planned per se- I met the people online and went there because i was on vacation and all of us had similar interrest (geeky stuff) and we went on a concert together. So we knew we click well and then had talking about stuff that okay for us and stuff thats not and all the important shit you talk about before you rub genitals together (like howto-safer sex, etc etc)  So, yeah, it can be complicated but its also a fun thing to do if done right.  It helps if the people participating are either poly(like the people I did that with) or not together at all-because jelousy can happen and its importat that everyone is able to stop the session/revoke consent  or do stuff without it getting problematic-that happens easier if you have a mono-relationship that plans to open up-because planning and wishing is one thing-doing it the other. So people ""trained"" in nonmonogamy are really important- minimizes awkwardness when 2/3 people know what they doing^  so, yeah, its complicated.  interresting and helpful reads: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lara-michelle/my-first-threesome_b_5597730.html  [NSFW] http://www.sexinfo101.com/multipartner_intro.shtml"

bisexual,39q6mo,Bmeblue,8,Sat Jun 13 18:01:28 2015 UTC,I'd be careful about living with someone you've only met a few times because if things start to go badly you could very easily end up with nowhere to live. It does sound like an exciting opportunity but I think it's probably best for you to have your own place.  Actually more than that I would plan as if you're going to have to do and pay for everything yourself. If everything works out well it may be unnecessary but otherwise you're giving an awful lot of power to a guy you've met three times just for sex.
bisexual,39q6mo,ganderso,10,Sat Jun 13 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"DO NOT MOVE IN WITH HIM.  Consider taking the deal, but find another way to do accommodation. Get a night job if you have to. It's also a good litmus test for your relationship: Tell him that you really appreciate the gesture, but you aren't comfortable staying with him yet because you don't know each other well enough. If he's okay with that, good! If he gets angry, alarm bells, do not fucking do it.  Also, tell someone else about this. Someone in your life. The closet isn't worth your safety."

You may just be noticing your bisexuality more because it's less accepted where you live now, so it's less integrated and it stands out to you more, or maybe, yeah, it's coming up more because you're maturing, who knows. Orientation tends to be pretty hardwired, or at least, it's impossible to pinpoint the ""cause"" of it, so my guess is you're both bi and unfortunately living somewhere where people don't give hugs. :( Here's a virtual hug, anyway! ---> ( )"

I (young adult female) said something about not being sure if I wanted a boyfriend right now, she jokingly asked if I wanted a girlfriend then, I asked what she'd say if I said yes. So that opened up the conversation.   Admittedly once she'd said she would be accepting of that, I felt awkward and when she asked if I did like girls I then chickened out and mumbled something about not being sure. I don't know if I'll try to tell her again or if I'll leave it at that, but for now it doesn't matter since she said she just wants me to be happy with whoever I'm with."

I have been anxious about that because I don't want you to make a big deal about it or say, ""I told you so,"" or believe that I'm actually just a lesbian and not wanting to admit it. I'm bi, I've known for a long time, I'm ready to share that with you. Please don't turn this into anything else.

I doubt your parents will say ""I told you so""--they may be a bit ""knowing"" about it, which is awkward, but they'll probably overall be understanding that sexuality is really complicated and often awkward to talk about, and sometimes involves false denials, and they'll just be proud of you for telling them.

If you're straight and you know you're straight and you identify as straight then that's you so long as you're being honest with yourself. I do believe, however, that a vast majority of people at least have exceptions to the rule. Maybe this is the case for you?         As with any decision you have to examine your motivation for carrying out that action one way or the other. Desire to fit in and for normalcy vs. desire to explore this new and confusing feeling.   My grandpa always told me that if you have more ""I wish I had'ves"" than ""I wish I hadn't haves"" then you're not living your life.

Maybe you get to a certain point and you're like ""Man, this is not for me."" That's fine. It's okay to explore, and it's okay to keep things on the DL until you know what's what. Or maybe you get like two months in and you're all about it and you want to tell everyone. That's cool, too.  I guess what I'm saying is do what feels right. Nobody can judge you but yourself. Also, keep in mind that there is a life outside of school. I'm assuming you're in college based on your age, which means you've got about 4 years before you enter the real world and none of this ""hypermasculine"" shit matters anymore.

Also, something that a lot of people don't think about is the difference between romantic orientation (think love/marriage/relationships) and sexual orientation (think sex/making out/etc.). It's also more than normal for this two orientations not only to be different, but maybe even contradict each other.  Lastly, try not to worry about your ""straight"" male friends finding out. If/When they do, they likely won't care, and if they do, is that somebody that you actually want to have in your life long term? If they do make fun of you, they likely aren't very good friends to begin with."

When you feel the way you described about someone and there's even the slightest chance they might reciprocate, you have to go for it. What are you gonna do ten or twenty years from now if you're stuck in some crappy, sexless relationship and you're still thinking about him? If you don't at least try, you'll always regret it. And fuck your ""friends."" If they're gonna give you shit about something as trivial as sexual orientation, they're shitty people and you need new friends."

A lot of times casual homophobia comes from a place of masculine competition, sort of ""no homo bro!"" type stuff, mainly because they feel no one is around to get offended, therefore they're not hurting anyone. It's no less wrong, but your friends might not be the homophobic bigots you think they are."

bisexual,39l5hc,John_Smithers,6,Fri Jun 12 16:56:58 2015 UTC,"Well, what I would recommend is this:  Usually the guys going ""no homo bro!""? You can tell whether they mean it as ""Haha I know this sounds totally gay but it's not"", or ""Ew omg fags need to die in hell and then die again and go to hell again"" type bigotry. The ""no homo"" thing is a direct result of our society both prizing masculinity, and seeing being gay or bisexual as 'unmasculine'. Boys are told to suck it up, don't express their feelings, and so we get a generation of 'I love you bro, but no homo!' type friendships.  I would start taking stock of your friends, and seeing which one(s) you might feel comfortable talking to this about."

I still kind of have feelings for her but that's another story. Looking back I now realize that I like 2 other girls before this but I just didn't know that. But I mean same goes for my other friend who didn't realize he liked guys until junior year. It takes time and do what YOU feel is right, and also what you think is a safe option.

He came back home and was almost in tears constantly because he formed such a strong bond with everyone there, especially her.  She was basically his other half, but she knew he was gay, and she thought of him as a good friend.  She had no clue about his crush, but he told me everything.  It was heartbreaking to see him so distraught,  Eventually he stopped mentioning her.  Since then every time I ask he says they lost touch, and that he knew he'd never be attracted to her physically and would never actually be able to live with her as a SO.  It's really sad, but there's nothing I could do to help him, and he's refused to talk about her or listen to anyone about it since."

You masculinity has nothing to do with your sexual orientation and furthermore, your sexual orientation doesn't have to be a firm line or, say, black or white.   Irrespective, I think you need some time to reflect on your feelings and then to take some time to candidly speak to this guy without hiding behind the lack of sobriety. He's probably feeling pretty guilty right now and like he crossed a line, and he probably deserves to know that you instigated the situation and actually wanted it, even if you don't decide to pursue a relationship with him."

So I empathize so hard with what you're saying here. And questioning totally sucks. I feel like questioning must only get worse as you get older--and you're even a little older than I was--because there are so many queer people who say ""I always knew!"" but some of us just need time to figure it out and it's not that strange in reality. I think it's safe to say you belong here, but still, it's okay not to be sure.  Now, in an ideal world I think you'd have time to figure out for yourself what you're feeling and come out and go through all that without juggling a relationship with it. However, I've gotta tell you... I was where you are. I've known other people who were where you are. We all knew that it was risky and potentially complicated and that we'd probably get our hearts broken in the end all that... and we all did it anyway. It is scary. Like holy shit. Especially when it's your best friend. But this is the stuff that the best love stories are made of, man. I don't think you will forgive yourself if you don't see this through."

In my opinion, if the only thing holding you back is the reaction of people around you, forget about them and let yourself be happy. Don't get too caught up in trying to perfectly adhere to whatever label you've given yourself, not many people do.  Skimming over the other comments so far, it looks like you've been in a bit of self-denial for awhile. I wouldn't blame you, since there's so much pressure to in some places, and ""bisexual"" is still kind of a dirty word if you aren't around non-straight people often (and even then...).

Petty bitches, including my gf at the time, would talk behind my back, and one freshman insulted me to my face. I gave him a good pop on the cheek, which I do NOT recommend to anyone as a solution, and that was the end of any derogatory words to my face. All my friends treat me exactly the same, as do my religious, southern grown parents. I stayed closeted until I had a boyfriend and was forced to come out, at least at school, if you can, wait till college, no one cares in college there are so many kids from so many backgrounds, there might even be an LGBT club or a gay/straight student alliance type deal. In short, don't feel pressured to tell everyone you're bi, if you want wait till college where you don't have a reputation as the straightest guy around"
bisexual,39nmd6,Drake5271,-1,Sun Jun 14 07:21:36 2015 UTC,"17?  At 17 the hormones and growth pattern along with the varied emotions makes for fun times.  We all recall being 17.  We were horny 24/7.   I'd take the same sex attraction with a grain of salt.  Now if you were 37 I'd say you are beginning to find your real self out.  The growth pattern evolves from the rat pack conduct of elementary school-- where girls are ucky--to middle then into high school where the male begins to form solid relationships with females.    That being said not everyone follows that pattern. Some guys are still all over the place in regards to their attractions which is now sexually driven by being 17 and horney 24/7.  That is the makeup of the male.   Now for advice?  Go for it. Evaluate the outcome (no pun intended). It is hard to make a value judgement upon something whereas your life experience is nil on that specific subject.  Just be a bit selective in regards to your partner as NOT to try to engage with one of your close friends who might go off on you. As for you super ""manly"" friends....that conduct is an over compensation to their own mixed up feelings.  Ever seen one of those lifted Brodoser pickups?  And some 5f guy crawls out from behind the wheel?  Ever been to a gay bath house?  Most guys are packing wedding bands.   We tend to project what we lack and what one fears.   My 2 cents @ 50ish and life experience.   As for manly, there is little if no doubt how manly bull riding and calf roping is in the realm of the spectrum of manliness. That's the arena I play in.  Successfully.   With no regrets.  It would be fun to be 17 again with good youthful looks and energy but with the maturity of being in one's 50's, coupled with the stability and finances that I now possess.  I've been broken up so many times, albeit hips, legs, shoulders and the like, that I am lucky I can even walk upright.   I have a 6"" gash on my back where a steer rammed his horns thru my back about 20 years back. But I still like cock.....and pussy.   Life is what it is kid.  Take what you got and run with it."

bisexual,39n1bw,graymankin,3,Sat Jun 13 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"There are no rules as far as I know. Some girls like to play the coy flirting game, others are direct and want to cut to the chase. Whether in romance or platonic interpersonal relations, everyone has a different style of interaction that they prefer. You've just got to find the girls who click with your style. You definitely shouldn't try on a ""dating persona""--it never goes well. I mean, of course there are always little tweaks we can do to present our most attractive selves (i.e., when I get excited I sometimes talk too loud--but since I'm conscious of that, I make sure not to), but beyond minor changes, you want to be as authentically yourself as possible. When you find the right person, they'll like you for you. Good luck!"

bisexual,39n1bw,aoeui-dhtns,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"That's true. I suppose I worry because it seems like I don't feel the same when a person likes me and the ones I do like either don't have mutual feelings or circumstance pops up.  I actually became irrationally fearful that this meant I wasn't actually pansexual; if I was, why was I being picky?  Which is nonsense because everybody has preferences, both physical and emotional. Anxiety disorders are not conducive to logical thinking.  Another problem I have is that older women intimidate me. There might be a slight worry about experience but I wonder if it isn't more about how my mother and other female ""guardians"" treated me as a child. Therapy is underway so hopefully I can bring that up and get over it; too many charming older women have shown interest and in response I've squeaked, scampering away like a mouse."
bisexual,39n1bw,CharlotteCorday_,2,Sat Jun 13 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear here. Women are individuals and there are no set of things that will work for every one of them. That also means that they will look for different things in their partners. There are women out there who will love your directness and enthusiasm. There are others who will not be right. Just because you haven't found a woman who is right for you yet doesn't mean it won't happen. It doesn't sound like you are actually struggling to meet and talk to women, more that none of the ones you have dated have been relationship material."
bisexual,39n1bw,CharlotteCorday_,2,Sat Jun 13 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear here.   I'm pretty sure I mentioned that there were variations. If I haven't made that clear enough in my post, let me know.   more that none of the ones you have dated have been relationship material   I haven't really dated them, if dating means several nights out.  Most of the ones I took on dates didn't return for a second. One who did wound up being simply curious and got weird after I started feeling strange about her version of an open relationship she had with her partner (friends with benefits were allowed and that's all she wanted). The other was the one I mentioned in the OP.  Typically though, they are the exceptions. When I am myself on dates, it ruins it and I don't know where to meet women. I've tried at ""ladies' nights"" - there was one full of couples and another where I met a shy girl who I scared off pretty quickly.  I tried OKCupid, however the ones who match with me will talk to me normally for a while and stop. I'm not sure when I'm supposed to suggest a meeting. Otherwise they straight up ask right away or say something sexual/overly flirtatious and I don't know what to do with that.  Then there are the ones through my social group - either not my type, intimidating to me, intimidated by me, or taken. Those who were free and who I liked were invariably put off and in a lot of cases I had misconstrued their wanting to get to know me for interest.  I can't tell normal interest from romantic interest a lot of the time, especially if the girl is attractive and friendly.  I don't know what flirting is and isn't, I don't know how to do it, and I don't know if it differs in a female-to-female sense. The girls I did get with in a sexual sense enjoyed my barreling at them like I do with men. Two main ones were the fuck buddy and the non-matching personalities one.  I've been looking for a girlfriend for a decade. I don't necessarily need one - female friendships are rewarding as it is, but something to do with my sexuality/romance feels incomplete. At the risk of perpetuating the stereotype of ""greedy"", I want to share my life with at least one man and one woman in a relationship sense. That feels like what my heart craves.  I am horrifically awkward, agoraphobic so can't get out to clubs, crap at online dating, and have reached the end of opportunity within the friend circle.  If I were to be melodramatic I'd say I'm cursed. If I were to be realistic I'd suggest there's something ""off"" about me which males seem not to pick up until midway through a relationship. That's when they realise that although the sex is fun, this one's a nutbag.  At least my current understands me somewhat.  Maybe I can't expect any sort of connection with a biological sex which seems to be inherently more complex in social interactions (not that males aren't multi-faceted) until I go to therapy and get the help I need. I have possibly months to get a diagnosis for the main communication issues and then I have to get the therapy, then the ""satellite"" problems need to be deal with.  Seriously, I can't tell if I should even be considering trying to get out there again if I lack fundamental understanding of social norms/rules, nonverbal cues, and get stuck on how people speak (like taking something literally or wildly misinterpreting because I don't have a damn clue what's going on).  Sorry, that was long but I'm frustrated. I know women are different, I know there are plenty in the sea, I guess I understand that I have to be myself. However, if ""myself"" is completely different to the more accepted ideas (probably autism, unpredictable, genderfluid, polyamorous and in a relationship) where am I going to find the magical woman who doesn't care and actually meshes?  It feels almost impossible."

bisexual,39l6ep,charredgrass,8,Fri Jun 12 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"I absolutely desire to be the M in a M/F relationship or M/M relationship. I'm bisexual female in a M/F relationship and I am so happy because I love him, BUT I totally know where you are coming from.   I can't remember I time when I didn't wish I had the capability to be a man with a huge dick whenever I so chose, tbh...."
bisexual,39l6ep,karma1337a,5,Fri Jun 12 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel that sometimes too! I don't really have any advice for you, but you're definitely not alone."
bisexual,39l6ep,Nitavere,3,Fri Jun 12 17:27:35 2015 UTC,I did when I was younger. I guess it went away as I got older and my perception of gender changed.
bisexual,39l6ep,Briana_Klover,4,Fri Jun 12 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I feel that way: temporarily (but strongly) while I'm having sex. In non-sexual situations, it never occurs to me to be anything but female."
bisexual,39l6ep,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,2,Fri Jun 12 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"I feel that way a lot. In my everyday life I'm usually very comfortable being male. I have guy friends, like GUY guy friends (lovable assholes) and I can hang with the best of 'em. Those times I feel right at home being male. But more and more my sexual fantasies are drifting towards being the woman in a relationship, more so f/f but also m/f.  As far as gender fluidity goes, I don't ever feel like I AM a woman, just that sometimes I might prefer to be. And again It's only when I'm in a state of arousal. I have no clue where it stems from. I haven't been in a relationship in a while, so I wonder if it's my subconscious trying to find an equilibrium between masculine and feminine psychic energies (I mean that in the least new-agey way possible). Like there's a woman sized hole in my life that my subconscious is pulling me in.  Anyway, I feel ya!"
bisexual,39l6ep,Internetimal,2,Fri Jun 12 21:03:03 2015 UTC,I crave being female in a f/m relationship.  I always view myself as the girl when watching porn or imagining sex.
bisexual,39l6ep,Bethfy,2,Sat Jun 13 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"'Maybe not exactly,' but I've had one hell of a transformation fetish my entire life, mostly for furry stuff but there have been days where the needle swings over to 'gender' (in combination of course because why not).  Like at least one other person has posted it's the sort of thing that (almost) makes sense in the moment but at the end of the day I'm happy to be male or my own custom postmodern gender that just happens to be equivalent.  But you asked about dealing with it, and I guess lately I've been noticing that fetishizing gender feels.. almost misguided.  How many of those roles or traits or whatever that 'seem' F or M are really limited to F or M people only, other than the strictly biological ones?  So while I don't deny that there are differences, I'm trying to go with ""gender's just a lie"" as one songwriter puts it lately and not see it as such a prerequisite to roles and behaviors and all that."
bisexual,39l6ep,thatdudewholurks,2,Sat Jun 13 16:42:55 2015 UTC,This. This is so true! No idea another person felt this way. I agree with you completely. I also fluctuate between wanting M or F and being M or F. Thank you for putting this into words.
bisexual,39mbz1,wretchegg,11,Fri Jun 12 19:15:42 2015 UTC,"Lied about being bi to find out more about you? I don't buy it. Sounds to me like she got scared when you said you were bi too, and her reaction has been all the junk that came after. Talk to her! Work this out properly.  Reddit's very quick to jump to ""ditch them quick"", when really they barely know anything about the circumstances. Dropping someone from your life is a drastic measure considering the situation is still ongoing."
bisexual,39mbz1,bloopityblech,4,Sat Jun 13 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, she sounds like she's the uncertain one projecting it on you. Yes she has issues, yes the way she is handling them could really mess with you. I just think it's worth considering that given some honest open discussion she might come around and admit to herself that she might be bi. I don't know how to do this but maybe you can try to help her without getting yourself in too deep... Like don't get so invested that her religious beliefs start making you question your self worth."
bisexual,39mbz1,WynJackwrench,2,Sat Jun 13 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with this too always read in between the lines (actions, tone of voice, etc) reading this makes me believe that your friend is indeed bi or even curious but she was probably discouraged by her bf since he wasn't accepting of her. She's most likely scared or in denial. I would say the previous commenters keep your guard up but maybe try sitting down to speak with her with all honesty. Either way best of luck to ya!"
bisexual,39mbz1,ScorpionBite20,2,Sun Jun 14 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"I talked to her again... And she admitted that her feeling (to me, as a bi) is real at first. But she's still insisting on putting it all behind because of sin. I don't think I should push any further since it has come to faith, there's nothing to do about it. Thanks for all the reply though."
bisexual,39mbz1,BeesorBees,3,Mon Jun 15 02:24:42 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry she treated you that way. You deserve better. Cut her out of your life and focus on people who make you feel good about yourself.
bisexual,39mbz1,DiviniteSauvage,3,Fri Jun 12 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"If 1) you can put your romantic feelings for her aside, 2) she stops judging you, trying to change you, and warning you about an afterlife you don't care about, 3) she stops getting butthurt when you hang out with other people 4) she stops being manipulative, dishonest and immature...  ...then yeah, sure your relationship will be fine.   It sounds like you should have other friends, too, though, because it seems like even if you do remain friends (which I doubt), the closeness that you had is never going to be the way it was. Only having one person in your life you can confide in is risky IMO."
bisexual,39mbz1,Drake5271,2,Sat Jun 13 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"My gut says she's bi. She lied about lying to cover her ass and try to put everything back where it was before her bf got angry. She hasn't come to terms with her sexuality, or if she has she's willing to sacrifice it to stay with her boyfriend. Sounds like highschool drama, she's a fickle little girl, at least, I what my intuition says, I could be miles off, as, I don't know the girl."

bisexual,39nnqq,Briana_Klover,5,Sat Jun 13 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"Bisexual, heteromantic."
bisexual,39nnqq,BrainMagMo,2,Sat Jun 13 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"Can't satisfy your need for a label, but I can satisfy your need to know there are others like you. Usually I'm not attracted to guys unless they're rather feminine and especially if they're crossdressers. I have that need for a label as well but heteroromantic bisexual is good enough for me, likely because I see bisexuality as a huge gray area already."
bisexual,39nnqq,amethyst_specter,2,Sat Jun 13 01:50:19 2015 UTC,"Hello,  I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I am ""straight"" most of the time. Married, happy, fairly masculine. I am not attracted to men physically, or emotionally. But I do crave sex with another man.  I refer to myself as bisexual. I do so mostly in private of course, as I've not yet found the confidence to come out of the closet except to my wife (who is also bisexual).  I do this because I am attracted sexually to men and women. I am not pansexual, or genderqueer (though I suppose I'm somewhat fluid there, as I sometimes get off on crossdressing)  Labels make things feel more solid, more real, whether or not it's true. When I first said the words ""I am bisexual"" out loud, it felt... good.   So, yeah."
bisexual,39nnqq,biqriusguy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:20:45 2015 UTC,Why label it? I call myself no for the sake of conversation but a word or simple phrase cannot describe my sexual orientation. Probably not yours either or you wouldn't have posted. I wouldn't worry too much about labels. They are really for generalization. Conversations and soliloquies are for specifics.
bisexual,39nnqq,somedude462,0,Sat Jun 13 01:27:09 2015 UTC,I'd say Heteroflexible.
bisexual,39kz8g,claimstoknowpeople,5,Fri Jun 12 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"Coming out as bi for most people in my life has just been a non-issue. It happens and nobody really cares because pretty much nobody in my social group is straight anyway. I don't know how it is for other people. Though yes, a lot of people obstinately believe that bi people just can't decide between being gay or straight.  I don't know how to suggest that you keep her from feeling overshadowed. I personally prefer that kind of thing to be uneventful.  A lot of bisexual women end up dating men just because it's easier to end up with men. Our entire society is built to facilitate straight relationships, so it kind of takes more effort to to find a woman to date."
bisexual,39kz8g,WooglyOogly,8,Fri Jun 12 13:45:09 2015 UTC,The dating pool for bisexual women contains many more men than women. It is to be expected that most bisexuals will end in heterosexual relationships.
bisexual,39kz8g,kuranuk,2,Fri Jun 12 14:29:56 2015 UTC,So is the idea here that openly identifying as bisexual actually reduces the dating pool for women because it turns guys off or makes them see the relationship as less serious?
bisexual,39kz8g,kuranuk,3,Fri Jun 12 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"I think what ray73 was saying is that, if you are a woman who is attracted to men and women, the number of women who are attracted to you is potentially 10% of all women (all queer women), while the number of men who are attracted to you is potentially 90% of all men (all straight men). Statistically, she is going to have far more men interested in dating her than women, just out of the gate.  Add to that biases against bisexuals (particularly from lesbians toward bisexual women) and that 10% of all women might drop lower.  And with regards to what WooglyOogly said… it's also possible that beyond the statistics, there is less social stigma from a heteronormative society for a woman dating a man, so that might have an influence too."
bisexual,39kz8g,kuranuk,2,Fri Jun 12 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, thank you."
bisexual,39kz8g,kuranuk,2,Fri Jun 12 16:40:15 2015 UTC,"First off, congratulations in having a supportive partner, and best wishes in your transition!  Next, in reading your question, I came up with a question of my own.   ...she's also having to come out to people as bi...   This makes me curious if you and your girlfriend have talked about whether she is attracted to other cis women, or maybe she's finding that, through your transition, she is really just attracted to trans women? Perhaps, even, you're just the one woman (cis or trans) that just PINGS for her?  All of these seem to be options that I've heard people report about their sexual experiences, one way or another, and it was just the phrasing of her ""needing"" to identify this way that made me wonder."
bisexual,39kz8g,BeesorBees,2,Fri Jun 12 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"Just to add my actual response to your question here, too:   I think it is pretty common for bisexual women to have little to no reaction to coming out. Furthermore, as my bi girlfriend has also discovered, particularly when you don't have a same-sex past partner to casually name-drop, it's something that if you combine our monogamously-leaning with other preconceptions about bi folks, you can get either no reaction or: ""Wait… you have a partner… why are you telling me this… do you want a threesome?"" Don't know what to say here, other than I think it says a lot about you asking this question that you are empathetic to how redefining for her own understanding of self this all is. Beyond having that understanding, as long as you're not actively diminishing the importance of her own redefinition of self (which it doesn't sound like you're doing), I think she will just have to accept, to some extent, that society sees your change as more eventful than hers. Maybe after your transition is old news, people might think to ask her about her experience, and that will be her time to shine as the supportive partner she hopefully is/was for you! Beyond the statistics I talked about in the other comment, I think past romantic history is the bane of many bisexuals I know. =) Personally, as a cis bi male, I was with my high-school boyfriend sweetheart for over a decade, and though I had dated girls in high school, I was really torn up that I wasn't ""really"" bi because all sorts of gay guys date girls in high school. I'm now in my third year with a wonderful bi girl, and she doesn't have a past experience of romantic relationships with women, and so has some similar anxiety. Any way you slice it, past ""credentials"" don't necessarily have any bearing on the attractions one currently posesses. =)"
bisexual,39kz8g,artichokess,2,Fri Jun 12 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"I'll ask her some of these things tonight. I know early on in the relationship she mentioned making out with girls a couple times in a way that showed she was concerned how I would react to that. She had some addiction problems as well until last year and coming out as bi seemed to be an important part of the healing process for that.   We haven't really talked about what women she finds attractive in general. The other night she said I was the prettiest at the trans support meeting but I know she was being biased there :P  I'm pretty sure she does see me being trans as an advantage just because if we're lucky we can make genetic kids together, something we're both hopeful for."
bisexual,39kz8g,artichokess,3,Fri Jun 12 18:49:28 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure she does see me being trans as an advantage just because if we're lucky we can make genetic kids together, something we're both hopeful for.   Aww! Well, best of luck to the both of you! Everybody's journey is a little different, hope for both of your successes.  (And although I don't want it to come off as pessimistic, if the relationship should end, hope that neither of you hold anything against the other. I've been in the unfortunate position of being the bi guy to leave the male partner for a woman, and my ex definitely did take the ""you can't trust bi folk"" path. Things happen, people change, and all we can do is our best at any given time.)"
bisexual,39kz8g,Drake5271,2,Fri Jun 12 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Regarding number 3: I am a feminine queer woman, and my experience with other women is similar to your girlfriend's.  I have only dated men, and my experience with women and others who are not men is limited to crushes and fantasies. I would suggest talking to her about her reasons for it; mine have been due to lack of chance and my penchant for crushing on straight women. I also identified as aggressively heterosexual when I was younger because I grew up in a place where identifying as anything other than straight was looked down upon. Her situation could be similar to mine, or, as you have suggested, she could have a preference for men, as some of my bi-woman-identified acquaintances have.  Good luck as you're coming out and transitioning!"
bisexual,39kz8g,cripplesmith,5,Fri Jun 12 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"I just read this comment to her and she asked if I was joking because it sounded exactly like her. Although she listed Ellen Page as one of the straight women she had a crush on, and I'm conflicted if I should tell her..."
bisexual,39ke7q,Zhuangzifreak,3,Fri Jun 12 09:57:30 2015 UTC,"I don't see how ''masculinity'' is at play there. What I see though, is an attempt by an individual to put blame on something. But that's just me. I see as much glorification of masculinity as demonizing of it. People are too comfortable expecting fairness of others to change themselves. Remember, lots of us still identify as ''masculine'', whether in a conventional way or not (I can be both masculine and feminine depending on how I feel); so this constant ""masculinity is at fault"" only serves to divide the community further. Instead of blaming things that are part of people's identities, why not say, ""bigotry, hate, division among the queer dating scene is a thing""? I'm probably going to regret having posted this but I just had to quick-vent."
bisexual,39ke7q,TWLX1,6,Sun Jun 14 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"I have really noticed this throughout the years and it's why I'm not in the queer community as much. As a queer femme in Georgia there's far more available men than women. In the lesbian clique, GSA, even amongst my friends I'm treated as not queer enough or the straight girl. It's frustrating when you're just outside of either community."
bisexual,39ke7q,Currlycutie,4,Fri Jun 12 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a bi guy in Michigan and I feel the same way. I've thankfully been building a support community of people who are similarly on the outside looking in.  There are a surprising number of us who don't feel comfortable or fully welcomed by either the straight or gay communities.  I don't want it to sound like they're unfriendly or unwelcoming but most of my gay friends consider me too straight and most of my straight friends consider me too gay for dating purposes.  I find that I tend to date other bi, queer, or trans folks. I've yet to have a straight or gay relationship last more than 6 weeks since I came out."
bisexual,39i7z7,throwisobvious,20,Thu Jun 11 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"I started watching it yesterday. I don't know why it isn't more talked about. People have been trying to place importance on having actors who fit the race of their role. This was a big issue when the Ghost in a Shell Live Action movie was being talked about. Sense8 has fantastic acting with a very diverse cast, but it does such a great job of just telling their stories and not pointing out their race every 5 seconds (except with the Chicago PD story where it is relevant). I feel like with everything Lana Wachowski went through this is her chance to be heard. The actor playing Nomi is actually trans in real life. But it is hard and challenging to watch. As someone who has struggled with Dysphoria it was hard to watch some of the hospital scenes with Nomi. The show does a good job of making you uncomfortable (I am so worried for the gay couple right now!), but in good ways."

I've been a Wachowski's fan since The Matrix and although I've generally liked most of their work, one thing they did that I really liked was how they took the advice from all those critics of Cloud Atlas and actually cast people in the race of their character and casting Nomi's character with Jamie Clayton an actual for-realsies trans-gendered actor.  Also it was great to see Freema Agyeman from Doctor Who and Naveen Andrews from Lost, two of my other favourite actors'/series'."

It does have flaws, it is tough to slog through at the very beginning, but it really does pay off quite well.  I ended up loving a lot of the characters, and their storylines.  Nomi and Amanita get all the hearts in the universe, but Hernando, Lito, and Daniella are also an absolute gem.  I was a little less sold on the Wolfgang and Kala situation, but I think it resolved (or didn't resolve itself) itself really well.  And they left some amazing open-ended things in as well to really made a second series possibly so good.  I really want to know what happens with Sun.  I'm wondering if Kala is going to go through the wedding.  And what are the repercussions of what Lito does? Is Will still just a Chicago cop or has everything changed since he helped Nomi and went after Reilly?  And all those nerd touches.  W.W.N.double-D! Conan the Barbarian! ""Baba O'Reilly"" on a ukulele! The freakin' Van Damn!  It just made me grin when the most ridiculous things happened.  I'm a huge Babylon 5 fan, and I have fondness for Jupiter Ascending and Speed Racer, so it was great to see what the Wachowskis and Straczynski can do together.

bisexual,39i7z7,Raven_Darkmore,3,Fri Jun 12 21:24:06 2015 UTC,To be honest around the third episode I guess - because around then you get to see how they could / can benefit from each other.

bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:29:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely loved this show!
bisexual,39i7z7,Nitavere,-1,Fri Jun 12 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"I can't stand it.   I know their hitting up reddit hard, but I couldn't even get past the first 15 minutes. It started out with a sick woman getting bullied by two love interests and then the rest was just so full of misogynistic bullshit I gave up."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,3,Fri Jun 12 01:23:51 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely curious - where did you see misogyny in the show?
bisexual,39i7z7,Nitavere,-3,Fri Jun 12 06:41:38 2015 UTC,"In basically every short that involved a woman.  I mean, it fricken starts with a woman writhing on the floor of an abandonned church getting ordered around by two guys and then shooting herself. The DJ is introduced to us by having two guys discuss her merits despite being a woman (and using it as a way to prop up a male character). I gave up when the Korean exec was asking the business woman where her brother was.  There's a difference between using misogyny as a narrative tool and just spraying it everywhere to create conflict at the expense of female characters getting objectified. Sense8 utterly failed at this."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,2,Fri Jun 12 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I can't say I agree. (e.g I thought the DJ and the Korean exec were laudable for persevering in their professional fields of choice despite annoying sexism.)  But hey, everyone's got different standards for what they find offensive."
bisexual,39i7z7,Nitavere,-1,Fri Jun 12 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't find the characters offensive, I found the writing offensive.  It's lazy as hell to make the most apparent struggle for both female characters as ""have to deal with sexist men."" It's lazy sexism to have so many characters in so many situations and yet still fail the Bechdel test miserably. It's lazy sexism to flesh out new female characters by having men size them up. The characters themselves are fine, it's the way they're used and written around that's not ok."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,4,Fri Jun 12 07:20:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, the main struggle for the female characters is way more than just their starting positions in the first part of episode 1. Dealing with their world's sexism isn't their main struggle.  There are definitely conversations that pass the Bechdel test - and also men who are fleshed out by having women size them up."
bisexual,39i7z7,Caged_Sinner,0,Fri Jun 12 07:42:00 2015 UTC,"I believe you, but after sitting through that intro I don't feel very inspired to find out if you're right."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,4,Fri Jun 12 08:00:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is though...if you think about it the show is realistic in this sense...Women in the world do struggle with that kind of thing, how is it lazy writing to show those issues and then show the very same characters thriving and empowered...I think if you didn't judge the show so harshly in the first episode and gave it a real chance you wouldn't feel this way.  I get that feminism is important and as a woman especially but its a show and its a show that's realistic to how the world is. Especially when it comes to trans women. The issues its depicting here are actually why we need feminism and its not really encouraging the behaviours its depicting...But obviously you're a logical person and you get that...  For example Dexter is about a serial killer but its not telling people they should go out and do that but it gives a realistic depiction of that scenario in most cases..."
bisexual,39i7z7,Caged_Sinner,0,Fri Jun 12 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"Writers get to pick which parts of realism they keep, and which parts they focus on, and which parts they throw away.  I get that sexism is a thing that happens outside of fiction. That doesn't mean I want to be confronted with it every 3 minutes in a show about people with mental super powers.  The issue isn't what the show is telling people to do, it's how they show the things they're doing. Spending half of the intro having the female characters sized up and bullied by male characters might reflect some kind of realism, maybe, but it's still awful."
bisexual,39i7z7,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,4,Fri Jun 12 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"It's not the first show to keep the awful parts, I'm not saying its a good thing but shows have been way worse about the exact same issue...And if it was all rainbows and butterflies in these people's lives it wouldn't be worth watching...And the male characters have struggles too...One of the male characters is a closeted homosexual and they show realistic issues about that too...It's not like writers are out to get women. It's not every 3 minutes and in some of the cultures depicted in the show its a really relevant issue...Such as in Korea where Sun the business woman is located...And in the second episode she kicks major ass and continues to in the entire season and even prevails over the assumptions made about her because she is a woman in Korea  Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it. But again, if you want to judge it on the first episode and completely condemn it because its realistic in a way you don't like then by all means."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,2,Fri Jun 12 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, they have sexism in the show. That is because sexism exists in the real world. They do not act as if sexism is good or OK.   The Korean woman goes through a lot more sexism later and they discuss the problem with the male dominant culture of Korea.   They also showcase transphobia and homophobia. That is because it is not set in a idealistic world where non of it exists, but the real world where people have to struggle."
bisexual,39i7z7,christopherawesome,5,Fri Jun 12 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough - but the first episode is kinda hard to get through because it doesn't tell you much. Misogyny I don't see - I see a lot of strong women and male selfhate and some assholes (male, but Nomi's mom is a bitch if ever I saw one) so it evens out. :) Some shows aren't for everybody. I was just struck by the adult way this show handles all kinds of relationships."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,-4,Fri Jun 12 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"Misogyny I don't see - I see a lot of strong women and male selfhate and some assholes (male, but Nomi's mom is a bitch if ever I saw one) so it evens out. :)   Wow. Yeah, no wonder you didn't see any misogyny in the first episode..."
bisexual,39i7z7,savbers,3,Fri Jun 12 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"All your comments are basically the same, but the misogyny I see is part of the storyline. But by all means don't watch it."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,5,Fri Jun 12 09:24:13 2015 UTC,"It's too bad you didn't make it past the first 15 minutes, you've clearly spent more than 15 minutes commenting in this thread about an opinion that is unfortunately uninformed.  Sun and Nomi are easily the two strongest characters in the season and Angelica was willing to sacrifice herself to save them all.  Which... you would have found out if you made it past 15 minutes."
bisexual,39i7z7,savbers,-1,Fri Jun 12 10:11:36 2015 UTC,"And it's too bad you didn't read my comments, because I already explained that it's the writing that's misogynistic, not the characters themselves."
bisexual,39i7z7,karma1337a,4,Fri Jun 12 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"If you want to know she loves Jonas but the white guy in her head is out to kill her and can find Jonas because of her connection. So she kills herself to protect him and everyone else in her cluster. TBH, things don't get interesting until the third episode."

bisexual,39i7z7,Allabear,2,Fri Jun 12 15:52:16 2015 UTC,That doesn't explain how that action is misogynistic or hateful towards women.  If it makes you feel any better there's a scene where this kinda thing happens again (gives up herself to protect others) but the woman is saved. I really doubt it has anything to do with hating women.

bisexual,39fw5o,geekguy121,16,Thu Jun 11 13:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you're going through this. Going to the doctor is a good step. It may  simply be a  matter of time, but  getting checked out won't hurt.  I haven't been in exactly this situation. I do find that I go between noticing women and noticing men, although the person I'm in a relationship with is generally exempt from this.   Maybe it's possible that his experience with the threesome left him  feeling ""full up"" on men for a little while? I've never heard of a bisexual completely losing attraction to one gender for life.   I'm  wishing you guys all the  best."
bisexual,39fw5o,BlueBerryJazz,6,Thu Jun 11 13:42:02 2015 UTC,Thanks. I really appreciate the feedback. I'm hoping that it's just a phase of his sexuality being fluid. I just don't know how to act until we know something for sure.
bisexual,39fw5o,deyesed,6,Thu Jun 11 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a tough situation. It's natural (and awesome) that you want to do something that will get his libido up for men, but realistically the best thing is to just continue being supportive and maintain other routines. It'll help reassure him that the issue is important to both of you and indicate that other parts of the relationship will be unaffected."
bisexual,39fw5o,Steve_the_Scout,6,Thu Jun 11 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it just might be a bit of sexual fluidity that hasn't popped up in the past. Usually it's a temporary thing, some people swing back and forth between a ""Kinsey 2"" and ""Kinsey 4"", some people are more extreme, some less. Still, it's a good thing he's checking up with a doctor if he feels it's an issue.  And I would say I've had it happen where a few times I was swinging between a ""Kinsey 1"" and a ""Kinsey 5"", and generally I just went with it because I knew it wasn't a permanent thing."
bisexual,39fw5o,Steve_the_Scout,3,Thu Jun 11 19:09:02 2015 UTC,Were you in a relationship during the times you swung from a 1 to a 5 and back? If so what was it like?
bisexual,39fw5o,aoeui-dhtns,4,Thu Jun 11 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"I was in a long-distance relationship with a gay guy at that point, so it wasn't quite the same as a regular, sexual relationship. I still felt romantically attached, I just didn't feel as attracted to his body during the ""1 phase"". Of course during the ""5 phase"" I was a lot more active in at least trying to help with sexual urges, although at that point he was growing a bit distant already so it ended shortly after.  Side note, it can be a bit of a long cycle, or it can be fairly short. It depends on the person. For me it's a fairly long-term, slow change."
bisexual,39fw5o,DoctorOsmium,3,Thu Jun 11 19:29:51 2015 UTC,Thanks! That actually helped a lot. We are in an open relationship so I can satisfy myself elsewhere for the time being.
bisexual,39fw5o,shakaspeare,3,Thu Jun 11 19:31:18 2015 UTC,Was anything weird during the threesome? Maybe he's just scared because he saw you with another guy and some anxiety is in the way of arousal?

bisexual,39fw5o,tsax2016,11,Sun Jun 14 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry that a bi lady (judging from your other comments possibly trans too) hurt your feelings. It sucks to get your heart crushed by someone, and blaming differences between you and her is an easy way to try to cover up the hurt and make yourself feel marginally better.  But attacking others who are like her isn't going heal you. It's only going to fester and make you bitter. That hate that you express could potentially hurt your relationships with friends, family, and partners."
bisexual,39fy3o,Bi-Rancher-Calif,5,Thu Jun 11 13:35:42 2015 UTC,"This phenomenon you talk about, seemingly straight men being more willing to have sex with other men, is because our culture is going through a profound change.  A change for the better in my mind.  We are finally discovering that there is nothing wrong with sex, whether homosexuality or heterosexuality.  It's all good.    When I was young, sex between men was illegal, and even if you were never arrested, any hint of homosexuality doomed a man to being rejected by everyone except other homosexuals.  We still have a long way to go towards full acceptance, but we've come a long ways in the right direction."
bisexual,39fy3o,bicoastaltoo,2,Thu Jun 11 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"well stated  rather than being illegal, I remember if one was labeled gay they were shunned and ostracized.   I guess it is still true in some circles. Even the ones I run in.  Maybe internet has a lot to do with things. The availability of gay porn...it maybe helps one sort out their own destiny.   Well I am off to the lake with the boat, the dog and my graying hair."

I run with men who are men.  I live in a world where getting tossed from the back of a bucking pony--therein you land on your ass like a dropped sack of grain.  I race SCCA and own several boats.  I never had or have had issues getting women. By no means of the word did I turn much of it down over the years.  What I find interesting is the phenomenal (new to me) of outwardly straight men from late teens up to my age who also dabble in cock.  I coined a phrase a few years back in another brain fart of reality trying to put a face on my own sexuality,  *Women are for warmth and men are for fun-excitement."
bisexual,39fy3o,Calgary72,2,Thu Jun 11 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from. I was raised in the church environment for almost 40 years of my life and I was in construction and had my own share of calluses and was around men all the time and am known as a man's man just like you.I think though even with society changing a little at a time, it is still like it used to be where most guys don't say anything and they live their lives in silence because they're expected to be a certain way. And I guess I don't disagree with that, because that's how life is. But that being said, I also think that we as human beings should be able to express ourselves sexually how we see fit without fear of retribution or condemnation.￼"
bisexual,39fy3o,cripplesmith,2,Thu Jun 11 15:20:39 2015 UTC,"You know I have thought about this a lot. Men get horney. Men begin to look for outlets for that release.  Some men would rather kill themselves than to think about a physical relationship with other men.  Until circumstances change.  Ie, plying alcohol, --lowering the inhibitions---jail, military, or whatever.  Quendincential  college frat party. Etc.  Once that river is crossed then it will either totally confuse the guy or the guy finds out that was not all that bad and sorta fun.  I heard the song yesterday--Billy Joe jumped off the Tallahassee Bridge.  I was told it was because he had spent the night having gay sex.    Some folks react that way.  I had a guy once way back who I met at the Rodeo, we ended up in bed. After he came he got up and put his back to me. He said if I ever talked to him again he would kill me. He left. To this day we avoid each other. 30 years later. Weird ey?    Others like ourselves find it an interesting outlet. While not something I could do 24/7 but neither could I do straight sex from now on.  I happen to like it both ways.  I have a ranch kid who is one of those corn fed straight kids from the mid west working on my ranch. He is just your a typical blond stud.  He has more women than nature should allow.   We were at an auction last month together. (I took him because he can handle roan steers and wild horses).    We got a motel with separate rooms. He knocked on my door about 10pm.  The rest is history.    I for the life of me cannot figure this all out. Maybe I have just begun to pick up on things more than I did when I was younger. Maybe the visual and physical ques are more obvious.  I just find this whole bisexual thing very very interesting and troubling actually. Like, troubling in the aspect of,  did I just wake up?  All these men.  Where were you all in 1980? 90?   My take."

Shes was far more advanced sexually thsn I and she showed and taught me alot. She introduced anal play while I was receiving a b/j, then some beeds toys ect. Fast forward fifteen years I got my wife to pegg me after reluctantly wanting to but she did it for my pleasure while not stimulating her self in any way. So I know my bi side is brought out by my craving for prostate stimulation. I couldnt be in a serious relationship with a man but definitely love sex with men in general.  And our society is now swaying towards individuality acceptance regardless of what that means to anyone, especially if it meant that brought out happiness to individuals. Also i believe there is an general conscience awakening towards sex is sex casual or other wise."
bisexual,39fy3o,TheLonelySamurai,2,Thu Jun 11 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing stats that indicated that the place in the US that gay porn is most popular is the bible belt. I'm only 19 and when I was in middle school I remember gay and fag being the most casual insults, and when you wanted to piss someone off you'd get more explicit and say that they like men or suck dick and a lot of people would get offended.   By high school gay was almost cool. People began priding themselves on how accepting they are and celebrating those out of the closet for their bravery. There was a pretty quick change from fag turning from the most casual word, not as bad as a curse word in front of parents, to the point where it's on par with racial slurs.  If I had to guess, people who repress homosexuality get curious. Maybe they look at gay porn to prove to themselves they don't like it, maybe they just think of gay acts while trying not to. But then some realize that they do like it. But since it was something you'd be ostracized for, they'd pretend to hate it to hide it or really hate it and go in denial to cope with it. But now that it's acceptable all the people who casually hated it, got curious, and turned out to have a little bisexuality in them, rather than hating it which is now very uncool, they've just embraced it like people have been embracing LGBT in general. I haven't been around long enough to know if this sounds right but it's something I've been thinking about recently."

Comments like these always suck to hear, but at least in my experience they're more due to casual/societal ignorance than anything else, and a far cry from a genuine dislike of queer people. I know plenty of people who will express how they find butch lesbians' style (haircut, dress, etc.) ugly--but they're also 100% pro-gay rights and have nothing wrong with these same butch women as people. Sure, there's underlying societally-ingrained homophobia/heterosexism informing what they find ""ugly,"" but that's very different from being a bigot. It sounds like your mom might be in this kind of camp. If that's the case, she'll probably be very supportive of you, and knowing that you're bi may make her reconsider her thoughtless comments.

bisexual,39e76o,SenpaiSama,2,Thu Jun 11 12:31:43 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it when it's done in person and clearly not fully meant. It's kind of endearingly adorable there.  Aside from that, I think it's just bad flirting. Like, that's just not a good way to do it. I don't think anyone would enjoy that."
bisexual,39e76o,VDRawr,2,Thu Jun 11 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"See I've always felt that way too, but I see it so often that I can't help but feel like there are people who are encouraging it, and I can't decide if I just don't see those people who respond positively towards it, or if it's only being encouraged by other guys who think that's how you flirt... :/"
bisexual,39e76o,Steve_the_Scout,3,Thu Jun 11 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with the latter. I don't really see anyone encouraging that behavior, if anything I see the opposite. It's just bad flirting, probably from someone not very experienced in it."
bisexual,39e76o,robotic_puppy,2,Thu Jun 11 06:51:34 2015 UTC,"I once had a guy hit on me from the car beside me, while sitting in traffic and waiting for the light to change. Now that's definitely being overly forward. It was kinda weird and funny at the same time. Can't say I'm attracted to that sort of behaviour though, I'm a more reserved guy and I like to get to know people first. Plus, the best time to flirt with me isn't while I'm operating a motor vehicle!"
bisexual,39e76o,TheTrashBin22,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:41:42 2015 UTC,"That type of flirting is creepy without some type of irl communication. It's equivalent to sarcasm through text. The only way you can see this type of ""macho"" flirting in text is if it comes from a petite female, because it is obviously not serious.  Also, it goes back to the area of psychology we don't fully understand, how attraction works. Common held belief is that feminine is attracted to masculine, and masculine is attracted to feminine. But that isn't true 50% of the time, and it is less in same sex attraction. Food for thought."

bisexual,39dou1,Valiant__Dust,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I think nipple piercings look hot on everyone, guys included (That's why I'm getting them done).  I've never seen a VCH in person, though the pics I've seen look pretty cool.  As a guy though, I'm not entirely sure I could let someone stick a needle in my junk, though I've thought about it."
bisexual,39dou1,pangrametry,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"It's not generally done primarily for aesthetics,  it's done for utility.  Since it's the hood,  it is a small membrane and a pretty minor piercing to get done,  more minor than the nips.  Depending on the piercer,  it shouldn't even hurt much"
bisexual,39dou1,Valiant__Dust,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:57:15 2015 UTC,"Well, like I said, I'm a guy, that piercing isn't even possible for me.  And like I said, as much as I'd like one, I don't know if I could let someone near my junk with a needle."

bisexual,39divm,Stjem05,3,Thu Jun 11 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"You are a sexual being.  I honestly think labels complicate things way too much, sometimes, and view sexuality as a fluid thing.  If I absolutely HAVE to, I'll refer to myself as bisexual to prevent confusion in others who might not understand the concept of sexual fluidity.  Don't worry so much about the label, and just do what (or who ;) makes you happy!"
bisexual,39divm,proudsmartass,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:28:58 2015 UTC,"Labels aren't what's important, the expression of your sexuality is. Do explore! Don't get ahead of yourself thinking about being in a relationship with a woman. When I was coming into my bisexuality, it was purely physical. Like I just wanted to touch and kiss women. But now I realize I could totally be in a relationship with a woman, or a man for that matter. But I only came to that realization by exploring my physical urges. So I say dive in!"
bisexual,39bz5y,BredditJ,9,Wed Jun 10 19:05:07 2015 UTC,"I absolutely would tell her. She probably is terrified of leaving that asshole and you fessing up could just give her the push she needs, that she is not alone and that she can lean on you. But, I'd also make very clear that she has no obligation towards you. So maybe it can help her to move away from her bf but maybe she will not want to be in a relationship with you. I think it's very wise to let her know that you are not expecting her to express her thanks by staying with you if she doesn't really want to. Good luck to the both of you :)"
bisexual,39bz5y,LauraKy,2,Wed Jun 10 19:14:43 2015 UTC,Thank you and I think you're right. Maybe just let her know that there is someone else in this world who loves her and she doesn't have to think he's everything.
bisexual,39bz5y,HunterSThompson_72,3,Thu Jun 11 12:39:47 2015 UTC,Holy shit you need to tell her everything

bisexual,39bz5y,smashleys,2,Wed Jun 10 20:37:05 2015 UTC,super cliche but.. the only regrets in life are the chances you never took... go for it!
bisexual,39bz5y,graduallemon,2,Wed Jun 10 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Tell her. She needs to know this. She's probably afraid that it's only physical with you or something, you need to tell her how you feel. And, tell us how it goes. If you want."
bisexual,39bz5y,jchaosrs,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:40:59 2015 UTC,"I thought it was only physical too. But with the amount of time we spend together, I hope she doesn't feel that way. Only one way to find out though..."
bisexual,39b0gk,fatzyp,54,Wed Jun 10 15:09:50 2015 UTC,Move on. She's trying to maintain boundaries and you should respect that.
bisexual,39b0gk,WooglyOogly,15,Wed Jun 10 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I've nothing against big age differences, but do not let yourself let her breach the trust relationship between her, her students and the university. Developing too close a relationship with a student will endanger her job. EDIT: I can't type properly."
bisexual,39b0gk,Krullenhoofd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:17:47 2015 UTC,I realise this. Thanks you guys for the input. The problem is - I am obsessed with her and I cannot stop thinking about her. To the point where I stalk her on the internet and get to know everything about her. I hate that I do this - but my feelings for her are just that intense. How can I get her out of my mind? This is clearly unhealthy.
bisexual,39b0gk,Krullenhoofd,10,Wed Jun 10 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"Have you got any intensive activities you can pursue in your life? Tends to help. I was recently a witness to a fatal traffic accident and getting on my racing bike and just cycling hard got my mind off it. Also, as hard as it is, just don't do it. Have a reverse Shia Leboeuf in your head whenever you want to look at anything to do with her. JUST DON'T DO IT! :P Being obsessed by her won't make you any happier I'm afraid. I've been in a similar situation (I was 20, he was 53, and my boss. 25M here btw) and just focusing on stuff that makes me feel good and healthy did me a world of good. EDIT: added my age. I need more caffeine it seems."
bisexual,39b0gk,Krullenhoofd,4,Wed Jun 10 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for that and sorry to hear about your experience, but I am glad you found a way to deal with it :) My only worry is that she is my lecturer and research supervisor so I am required to see her all the time for the remainder of this year, which doesn't help me with my feelings.  I suppose I should distract myself in the ways you've suggested, in the times I AM away from her... because I tend to put on romantic songs and fantasize about her... counter-productive to say the least.   I will have to immerse myself in other activities because I have actually lost interest in things that I usually enjoyed ever since developing this crush :/"
bisexual,39b0gk,Krullenhoofd,6,Wed Jun 10 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds eerily familiar. Getting through this requires some effort and no small measure of self discipline. Get through this and you'll be proud that you did. Physical activity really works as it triggers the production of endorphins, which make you feel good. Seems like the crush is your only source of endorphins. If you cultivate more sources you can wean yourself of that crush"
bisexual,39b0gk,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Jun 10 15:41:51 2015 UTC,...And give her some breathing space in the process. She probably just thinks I am THAT annoying student that always wants assistance. She does not know the half of it. Just as well.  Physical activity it is! :)
bisexual,39b0gk,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Jun 10 15:47:34 2015 UTC,Good luck! :)
bisexual,39b0gk,aoeui-dhtns,2,Wed Jun 10 16:31:58 2015 UTC,Are you able to request a new supervisor?
bisexual,39b0gk,aoeui-dhtns,3,Wed Jun 10 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"At this point I doubt you are capable of being ""just friends"" with her.  It's probably best if you back off, and try to keep things as professional as possible."
bisexual,39b0gk,Hard4Dpp,2,Wed Jun 10 21:32:01 2015 UTC,"No unfortunately I cannot as she is the only person that specializes in the topic of my thesis. Added to that is the fact that she is brilliant at what she does and is an excellent supervisor - a sure shot way to ensure a good mark.  Yes, that's the direction I am headed at the moment - keeping things professionally. There is no other way around it really."
bisexual,39b0gk,Hard4Dpp,21,Wed Jun 10 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"First of all, she can't be with you. It would jeopardize her career. There is just no way. So you must recognize that you don't have a future with her, and deal with your own feelings. That sucks but it is the truth. <3  If you really are obsessed, see a therapist. Limerence is awful and it really hurts and it's hard to escape. I think the best thing you can do is not see your professor at all until your obsession dies down. Don't think about her… and if that turns out to be impossible, then get something to distract you, moment by moment. I used cartoons :)"
bisexual,39b0gk,BadassInTraining,3,Wed Jun 10 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"Not to mention she is straight, adding to the impossibility of there being anything more.  It's vacation season now so that helps. I have been seeing a therapist but I just said I idealize my professor and it is unhealthy. I did not mention my romantic feelings or that I have a crush. I am quite ashamed and worried about how the therapist would perceive that... (I am a closeted bisexual, but that's another issue altogether)  But yes, distractions it is :)"
bisexual,39b0gk,strombus_monster,10,Wed Jun 10 15:56:15 2015 UTC,You need a bi-friendly therapist for sure
bisexual,39b0gk,cbrachyrhynchos,7,Wed Jun 10 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Do not sleep with a professor, period. Do not attempt to sleep with a professor, period. You have meandered into a realm where there are professions on the line if someone makes a mistake. Never play with a professional cohort, very little good can come from it."
bisexual,39b0gk,imcomminoutbi100,2,Wed Jun 10 17:47:59 2015 UTC,No worries - I cannot even think of telling her. She is straight and it could lead to very awkward encounters going forward.

bisexual,39b0gk,wizehopt,4,Wed Jun 10 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"You have to move on. It's not about anyone's sexuality or whether they are male or female. It's the professor-student relationship and it comes with boundaries. Your professor is right to keep meetings brief, it prevents anything inappropriate from happening. This is her career we're talking about.   The best way to deal with it is to avoid taking classes with her until the infatuation is resolved."
bisexual,39b0gk,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Jun 10 17:42:33 2015 UTC,I hear what you are saying but I cannot avoid her - she is my thesis advisor and nobody else in the department is specialized in my topic aside from her. I have to get this thesis completed by the end of the year.  The best I can do it email her work stuff instead of going to see her which will maintain that distance.  Thanks for your input :)
bisexual,39b0gk,Justice_Prince,3,Wed Jun 10 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"I understand, a little bit - not an age gap/inappropriate relationship, but a coworker who I saw every day for the next three months. And it was/is definitely harder to get over someone without any distance. But you can do it. You have to.   Things that may or may not help:   If you have to see her in person, put physical distance between you two Sit to the side in classes, not directly in front (I'm assuming since it's a specialized topic that your classes will be too small for there to be a ""back"" of the room) Use closed body language, don't lean towards her unless you must Try not to make as much eye contact"
bisexual,39b0gk,Justice_Prince,2,Wed Jun 10 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"I will try. Thank you. I do some of the above already aside from the physical distance thing - when I go to her office, I sit on the chair closest to her for example. That needs to stop.  And I always make eye contact in class. Or just look at her/admire her beauty. Doesn't really help so that needs to stop too.  ugh it is the hardest thing. Interestingly, I was in love with my straight best friend for years, and now I kinda 'got over' her ever since this unhealthy crush. I swear it was much easier to be in love with my best friend lol."
bisexual,39b0gk,tricky_tree,2,Wed Jun 10 20:59:15 2015 UTC,The age gap isn't a problem. Professional boundaries are potentially a big problem. I'd say enjoy your crush from a respectful distance until it fades away or you've moved on professionally.
bisexual,39d63e,1dazedandconfused,2,Wed Jun 10 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"what I've been watching a lot lately is ""ladyboy"" porn and I find it kinda hot, idk why   Just know this really isn't the road to go down. If you're down for sucking cock, go check out the m4m sections. I don't want to get into the whole big thing on here but the majority of trans women are not appreciative of this kind of attention."
bisexual,39d63e,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:21:15 2015 UTC,What you're talking about is pretty similar to a lot of posts here. I think that wish to give oral sex is a strong indicator that you like men in addition to women. But it takes time to acclimate to guys… You will be attracted to more of them once you've had some experience. I say go have fun :)
bisexual,399n9e,relthrowaway181,12,Wed Jun 10 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"First of all, ""heteroflexible"" is glorious!  Second. As someone in this situation. If they are realllly big into being anti anything not straight. I'd leave it. Bite the bullet and continue on forward. (to me anyway) This is nothing to lose family over.  But! If they'd be cool with it and appreciate your honesty and are the kind of people that could turn a new leaf. Tell them. Pour your heart out"
bisexual,399n9e,WillemDafoesAlterEgo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"I think they'd love/support me regardless. They wouldn't cut me off or anything.

I haven't come out because I don't want to disappoint them, I've always been a good kid they can be proud of."
bisexual,399n9e,plantstand,3,Wed Jun 10 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"You're still you, your orientation shouldn't disappoint them."
bisexual,399n9e,nolaredditthrowaway,3,Wed Jun 10 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"Are you financially independent? If you depend on them it may be safer to maintain the charade.  Also, how often do you meet your parents, and how important is it for you to maintain a good relationship with them? What about other family members, are they similarly conservative?  I'm just saying you need to evaluate the potential consequences and act accordingly."
bisexual,399n9e,ageeksgirl08,3,Wed Jun 10 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"If it's none of their business either way, tell them that next time they ask.

The family already hates me, so I don't see the point in making things mkre difficult for myself.   If I were you, I'd just keep the matter to myself. It's really none of their damn business anyway."
bisexual,399n9e,Hard4Dpp,2,Wed Jun 10 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"Given their attitude, I'd probably just tell them that you and he are together, you care about each other, and he treats you well; anything else is none of their business, and they need to cool it."
bisexual,399n9e,plantstand,2,Wed Jun 10 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, tell them it is none of their business, end of discussion. If you want to further lay down the hammer, ask if your mom likes it where the sun doesn't shine. See if either of them are willing to open up about their life that is none of your business. Or if you are interested in taking the more diplomatic approach you can inquire about how their finances are and if they would like to involve you in most of their personal life decisions that have no barring on how you live your life.  If you want them to accept the idea of being bisexual you could have a heart to heart about what it means and why the stygma attached to the concept is unwarranted. There are many avenues you could take this topic to them, but I always error on the side of ""Does it matter? It isn't your life and I would not ask you about your bedroom preferences, so please don't ask about ours."""
bisexual,399n9e,plantstand,2,Wed Jun 10 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point. Their insistence on knowing about his sexuality (while making some assumptions about mine) is intrusive."
bisexual,399n9e,Gallifreyan_fez,2,Wed Jun 10 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"Come out yourself as bi, problem solved. They won't have heart attacks. They'll be thrilled you're dating someone of the opposite sex. You can direct them towards the various religious support groups for gay people.              It will be high in short-term stress, but low in long-term stress. They'll get over it, and maybe they'll treat you less shitty. You might even helpfully influence their politics: it's easier to hate mythical bisexuals than it is to hate real ones that you know. In the long run, it will be much better for your physical and mental health. Your sex acts might not be their business, but if they truly care about you, they won't reject you for your sexual orientation identity. And shaming your SO for being possibly bisexual is just them being shitty to you.            edit: For the religion bit, be sure to know the bible verse about the log in the eye. Re-read Sodom and Gomorrah (hint: it isn't about gay people, but there is attempted male rape). And also read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_and_Jonathan"
bisexual,399n9e,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,3,Wed Jun 10 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"it's easier to hate mythical bisexuals   This is exactly it. It kind of hurts to hear them railing against homo/bisexuality (e.g. openly referring to them with disgust and implicitly expecting me to share in the disgust, since I'm presumably 100% straight). And it's awkward to hear them denigrating all kink as abuse, since.... I'm secretly kinky.  Basically... I want to make them re-think their negative assumptions/prejudices, but I don't want to make them think too hard about my own bedroom interests :( But maybe making them think about my bedroom interests is worth changing their viewpoints? IDK."
bisexual,399n9e,plantstand,3,Wed Jun 10 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"Wait, why are they denigrating kink? Who from the Bible Belt actually talks about that in polite conversation with their kids? Serious WTF here. I would seriously wonder if they'd caught something you'd done, and were trying to send you a message. This is a good one to draw a boundary on. Perhaps say you don't want to hear about their sex lives or even their opinions on other people's sex lives. Or ""I think you've been reading too much 50 Shades of Gray."" Meanwhile pick up the book ""When someone you love is kinky"" by Dossie Easton, you'll probably need it eventually, but one thing at a time.           If they already suspect you or your SO is gay/bi/something, then they're already thinking about your bedroom interests a bit much. Take them out of plausible deniability land and tell them the truth. If they want to be hurtful, they should know they are directing it at you personally. It's already affected your mental health, now hasn't it?          If they really love you (and they probably do), they'll come around eventually. Coming out was quite the mantra in the gay community in the 90s or so, and with people going from ""I don't know any gay people"" to ""I know at least one gay person"" you've also seen a sea of political change I would have never thought possible. If you can afford to come out, you might as well. There are risks. They might disown you or cut off your financial support, so keep that in mind. (/r/personalfinance is really good for getting your financial house in order, btw)         Bisexuals have higher health risks, including depression, and some of that is likely from not being out and from various stresses:   http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/lgbtq_health/bisexual_health/health_concerns_for_bisexuals.php So cut those stresses! Personally, I think you should be able to expect support from your own family. You might be surprised, coming out might be quite anticlimatic. And it might help if you can point out groups that they'd be OK with. If their picture of bisexuals is from the wackiest photos taken at a Pride Parade, tell them about the Log Cabin Republicans. You can tell them that most of the groups in some Pride Parades are religious. Normalize being bisexual/gay for them.          edit: Tell them you joined a gay church, and I bet they'll be thrilled."
bisexual,399n9e,Chris770,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:52:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a little curious as to why your parents know that your boyfriend has some bisexual feelings/experiences, but they don't know about you? Did he tell them? Did you?  If he told them, he's obviously pretty comfortable with it, and I would just let them think what they will. If you love your boyfriend, stick up for him. When they ask rude questions or make unfair accusations, stand your ground, tell them that his feelings, experiences, and/or orientation don't make him any more likely to be unfaithful than anyone else. Tell them it's not up for discussion and that it's his business.   If you told them... Without telling them about yourself, well, I think that's a bit low. It doesn't show a lot of courage on your part to out him and not yourself. I'm not trying to be accusatory. I don't know all the circumstances. But if they know about him because of you, I think it's your turn to own up."

He presents as straight (as do I), and we've never given them any indication of being otherwise.  I guess you could say there's something slightly ""feminine"" about the way he acts? I think it's great, honestly, but it seems to raise some questions with my family."
bisexual,399n9e,im_am_a_h8r,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"Let's look at your options   Tell your parents and be completely open. There is a chance they change their thinking but their is also a change you damage your relationship with them. Obviously only you can guess the likelihood of the outcome here. You break up with your boyfriend and go with your parents way of thinking, obviously this seems like the worst option to me. You lie to your parents outright and accept that you are going to have to lie. You won't ever really feel like you have a fully honest relationship with them but you will have a relationship. Honestly most people don't talk about their sexual relations with their parents so it won't be that outlandish. This is the safest option.   So I'd say the decision should be based on how likely you think your parents are to freak out about it or how likely they are to change. From the info given I'd go with option 3."

bisexual,39a07l,Autumn-Moonlight,10,Wed Jun 10 09:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not in the same situation as you, with being in a religious school, but I found that if you are around people who like you becase of who you are, then you can ignore the hate that you occasionally get, because you know that there are always people who will support you."
bisexual,39a07l,Feoe0103,7,Wed Jun 10 11:16:29 2015 UTC,"I (a man) went to a semi-progressive catholic school (music-focused school in the middle of Sydney). Came out four years before I graduated. Even some teachers knew. Nothing bad happened. Ended up forming a clique of queer folks, but never got a boyfriend. Once some people came up to me and said ""I hear you're bi"" in a vaguely threatening way, probably intending to bully me. But I just said ""Yes, are you interested?"" and they left me alone.  I fell for a guy who was so deep in the closet that he denied his homosexuality even to himself until years after I graduated, and after that fell for a guy who was openly gay, but not interested. I had bad luck in HS, I guess.  Edit: I should add that I have since discovered that at least 6 of my high school teachers are openly gay men themselves. I only knew about 2 of them while I was studying there, the rest were more closeted."
bisexual,39a07l,kamatsu,5,Wed Jun 10 12:34:50 2015 UTC,"I came out to a small group of friends at school. It went fine. It felt really great to be honest about myself.  In general, coming out in a situation you can't control is riskier than doing so in one you can. You can't really control your high-school life. It it goes badly, it's gone badly and there's little you can do. You can't leave the school. You will also have limited access to a gay community you can go to if things get homophobic.  That's a factor to consider. I have worked with a few kids who came out in the UK (where I am from). They all had very positive experiences. The biggest problem was people not taking it seriously which - whilst sucky - is not really a downside. If you want to be honest about who you are, it's better for 80% of people to know and believe you, than for 0%."

Semi progressive religious school in one part of the world might be extremely restrictive and bad in another.  Here in Ireland, over 90% of all schools are Catholic, most schools don't care. It's only the staff who can get fired for being LGBT or Atheist, not the students."
bisexual,39a07l,robbdire,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"That's insane to me. In the US a teacher or staffmember or even a janitor could never be fired for being an Atheist; both religion AND non-religion are protected classes under the 14th Amendment as ruled by the Supreme Court.   The Federal government cannot discriminate in employment against LGBT people, also ruled based in part on the 14th Amendment. But there are a distressing number of states where someone can be fired from their job at a private company, if the owners so decide. But in my state, California, gender and sexual minorities are protected classes under the law and it's illegal to discriminate against them in almost any capacity. And in fact many school districts and universities encourage LGBT people to serve on staff and encourage LGBT pride displays. At least in the bluer, more urban and suburban counties.   Ireland in comparison seems very backwards in that regard."
bisexual,39a07l,Phaedrus2129,3,Wed Jun 10 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Ireland in comparison seems very backwards in that regard.   Well almost all public schools are Catholic, and religion is enshrined in our constitution.  In many ways Ireland is EXTREMELY backwards, 14 years in prison for abortion, 5 years separation before you can divorce, a blasphemy law, damn near impossible to get your child into a school without a baptismal cert (which I am not doing. My daughter is not getting baptised). We had the UN call us out as a country on this shit quite recently.  Only good thing we've done recently was remove the restrictions on adoption so single people, and same sex couples could adopt, and same sex couples could marry, and transgendered people don't have to get divorced to have their new gender recognised."
bisexual,39a07l,robbdire,2,Wed Jun 10 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Same sex marriage is a huge one. You beat us to the punch on that, we still have a dozen states where it's not recognized. There should be a Supreme Court ruling by the end of this month, though.  Also, unfortunately, people in the US do still get fired sometimes for their religion or sexuality. It just gets masked as a layoff or a performance issue. It's hard to stamp out discrimination entirely."

bisexual,39a07l,JustForBrowsing,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"I go to a Catholic School in the UK so situation is likely to be very different. I had a friend who came out as bisexual (I'm closeted and plan on staying that way for now) and it went okayish to be honest,most of her friends weren't too bothered though some of them quietly disapproved, sadly there was some name calling when she was alone. It's been 7 months and people have mostly forgotten about it (she's not dating anyone) or accepted it. Personally I'd say go for it if you want to (she's much happier now) but be prepared that not everyone's going to be accepting."
bisexual,39a07l,IcarusofMine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be totally honest: in high school, I thought it was a secret. It wasn't a secret.  I'm pretty lukewarm on the whole 'COMING OUT!!!' as a really big thing. I went to a religious school, and the way I handled it was that, at a certain point, I dated someone of the same gender after having dated folks of the opposite gender. When people asked me whether I was gay, I shrugged and said ""I'm not sure yet."" Everyone pretty much left me alone after that, aside from a few mean comments. When I got to college, and put a couple more years into appreciating and understanding my sexuality, I understood that I was bisexual, and I still don't talk a whole lot unless it's relevant. I'm a pretty private person, though, so I generally think my sexuality is between me and the person who gets to see me naked. I've also had people tell me that it's not fair of me to approach it this way, because I can ""pass"" as straight if I have an opposite gender partner. I usually tell them that it's very nice of them to tell me how to be queer.  Here's my advice: When you're in high school, it may or may not be worth it to come out as bisexual. There's enough bullshit around it in the adult world, and high school is honestly such a blip in your life. If you don't think that it will significantly improve your ability to navigate that morass, and if it does not cause you emotional pain to keep it inside for now, consider not doing it. Not out of fear; out of convenience. Soon you'll be in a much, much bigger world, where you're much more likely to be understood and accepted-- you're much more likely to find your tribe, as RuPaul says. It really does get better.  One more thing, and I know this might make me unpopular: based on my experience, and that of many, many other adults I know, you may not be totally crystal clear on your sexuality yet. I sure as hell wasn't; I had lots of hormones and lots of crushes and I easily could have fought my way through those and realised that I was straight at the end of it. Some people come out as bisexual only to later realise that they're all the way gay. If you're not totally certain yet, and-- again, this is crucial-- you feel okay about it, and keeping your feelings inside is not causing you harm or pain-- not broadcasting it from the rooftops is also a totally valid option. Do whatever feels like it will make your life easier. My heart goes out to you <3"

I'm pretty certain I'm bi, I have been since the start of middle school with no changes or shifts or periods of questioning. As for wether or not I'll come out, I think if there is a guy that I really like and we hit it off and I feel like I'll be happy with him I'll come out. I don't plan on joining the dating scene until next year when I can drive and have a job. Though there is still a part of me itching to get out."

If you have the same then absolutely, you'll feel great"
bisexual,39a07l,Sinajan,0,Thu Jun 11 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"I remember watching a video about this gay boy (his name is Austin Wallis, you can find him on Youtube) who got suspended from his catholic High School because he was gay. They, in fact, told him to stay in closet or leave the school which should make it look like a choice and eventually made him change schools. Of course, this is not something you have to hide in any way if you do not want to which is one of his reasons why he could not stand staying there. It was very heartbreaking for him, I remember, saying goodbye to his friends there and start all over again. It was, however, the only right decision for him. He can be with his boyfriend right now without feeling like he does not deserve his presence and does not need to hide anymore.   What I want to say is that you have to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages, the amount and how important each one is. Since your school is catholic they unfortunately can tell you to leave or hide or any other terrible thing and you have to decide if this is worth it. I assume not feeling accepted and loved and cared for for what you are is one of the worst feelings ever which is why I totally understand every person that would leave the school in such a situation. I hope that your friends will stand by your side through all of this and I'm sure you can make it through. If you finally decide you would rather stay quiet it is totally okay, too, since your sexuality is a private matter and you don't have to tell anyone. If you feel better then, do whatever you think is good for YOU."
bisexual,39a07l,Sinajan,2,Wed Jun 10 21:58:43 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd kick me out. We have a few lesbians and a polyamorous girl here. So no danger there.

bisexual,396j2q,taytay9955,3,Wed Jun 10 13:47:52 2015 UTC,That's great ! My SO and I have been talking about this but I am worried I'll get jealous. How did you handle those feelings?
bisexual,396j2q,bobulesca,11,Tue Jun 9 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"Basically, the SO and I talked A LOT about it before it even happened. We made online profiles, we talked about if we wanted it to be with someone we knew or a stranger etc... At first, I felt like it would be better to have it with someone we didn't know so there would be no strings attached type things... I also opened myself up to certain people I was close with to make myself comfortable with the idea of it happening, get others' opinions etc... Thankfully, one of my best friends is bi so when her and I hung out together one day, I casually mentioned the fact that my man and I were looking to find a third party for sexy times... she volunteered, and we were both pretty stoked because we both find her really cute. This talk happened MONTHS ago... that's how slowly we all took it... we hung out a bunch on our own, establishing a lot of trust together without my SO, and really hyped ourselves up about the possibility of it happening.  I even told her that I had a few concerns about me being jealous, and we talked about boundaries. Thankfully, she had done this once before and she told me that she usually likes focusing on the girl in this type of deal, ESP with it being a couple, one of those members being her best friend. I think the key was really finding one of my open minded friends who I share trust, love, and comfort with. Talking about it a lot gave us many positive feelings of anticipation, excitement etc, hardly leaving any room for nervousness or jealousy.   When it came to Sunday, we started slow, and communicated throughout the entire ordeal. It was awesome, and we hope to try it again soon :)   Edit: I also wanted to say good luck to you on your journey, and if you ever want any more questions answered or advice, I would love to share more about my experience with you!"

It took a little while for me and my SO to process these emotions, but we are both so excited and proud that we found each other to be open minded with, without the negative feelings I was so scared of. I had been looking at a lot of reddit threads about threesomes, and a lot of them were overwhelmingly negative, so it really scared me that I wouldn't be able to handle these emotions!! I didn't let fear stop me though, and I am glad I pushed through it because I feel strong, empowered, and happy as fuck!! Thank you for your support :)"

I also and I hope this is not tmi, have had to develop kinkier and kinkier fantasies to get off while he is going down on me. It started with exhibitionist fantasies of men watching me getting eaten out or being peeped on by someone. Then I started fantasizing about being a stripper and giving men a little something extra.

I only really find myself drawn to guys who are fairly effeminate or who are fascinating and intelligent. I find the female body extremely attractive all the time, but uh. Well, to be very blunt, if we're going by a 1-10 system, the personality and mind of someone, male or female, gives like a 6-7 point swing in attraction. I almost never find men attractive physically alone, but a guy I get to know can be insanely hot. Likewise, anyone who is intelligent and warm can shoot up from like a 2 to a 9. And a 10 who is selfish, petty, and stupid will rocket down to a 3. I dunno if that's common, but I just wanted to back up that comment describing how much of a factor the mental aspects of attraction will affect the physical."

But that has a lot to do also with how I personally interact with people. The other differences I experience in dating just depend on the kinds of guys and girls I tend to attract/be attracted to: the guys are usually pretty introverted, so we talk less and it's more about actions, we have formal dates, things like that; the girls are pretty extroverted and spontaneous, so we're more likely to go off and watch the sunset and have long conversations."

bisexual,397kmo,gracie1381,4,Tue Jun 9 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I think one of the important things for someone when coming to the realization that they're bi (or not straight in general) is that it doesn't have to change anything else about them. You're still the same person you were before, with the exception that you understand who that person is just a little bit better. That's not to say that it won't, can't, or shouldn't be a big part of your identity, it certainly can be if it's important to you. Certain people latch on to certain things to use as a foundation for who they are and that is fine. That is also not to say that you won't change eventually because of it. A personality is basically the summation of nature and nurture, and the nurture part may change as you meet and interact with new people as a result of realizing that you are bisexual, which is also fine.       But for starters, I would just say that you're the same ""you"" as before, just now you know you're bi. :)"

bisexual,395xq2,I_Am_Slightly_Evil,4,Tue Jun 9 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"Some recommend douching before anal, but douching can go badly wrong, irritate your gut, and make things worse.  If you decide to douche, use lukewarm water with NO SOAP in it, and don't get it any further into your colon than your rectum--you don't want water to get in any deeper than his dick would, basically, or else you'll be expelling it for 30 minutes.  The alternative to douching is to start taking a fiber supplement today, so you have a few days for it to work through your system.  I recommend metamucil or any other psyllium-husk supplement.  If you have a good fiber level, you should be able to just slip a finger up there while showering, like, 15 minutes to an hour before the act, and make sure you're good to go."

This stuff may sound weird or gross, but will make the sexual experience so much better for you and your partner, cuz yeah, shit dick is going to kill the mood for both of you.  Pick up some saline enema bottles from the drug store. Fleet is the name brand, but the store brand works just as well. Squeeze it in your butt (over the toilet of course) hold it in, then stand up and jump up and down before flushing out. You can overdo enemas certainly, but I don't think those bottle things shoot up into your guts, they just clean out the duodenum. Another way I clean myself out is to use a smallish dildo. Just do yourself over the toilet till it comes out clean.   If your top is not experienced, you may need to tell him to take it slow at first. Have fun!"

The two things are not necessarily related to each other. Because even though I find women sexually more attractive, it does not mean I don't find men sexually attractive at all. And romantically I don't really have a preference. So if you love your boyfriend and if you have great sex and if you enjoy his body, there is no need to worry."
bisexual,396i1i,WooglyOogly,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:40:06 2015 UTC,"Im very curious. What is it about a mans body that you find attractive? Does literally the site of a mans body turn you on? Because it doesn't turn me on. Don't get me wrong, I can see that asthetically its beautiful and if he has a great personality and takes care of his hygeine I find the act of sex to be emotionally and physically fulfilling. But just looking at his body does not rev my engines. Does this mean I am not attracted to men? It may seem like a simple question, but its not :/"
bisexual,396i1i,plantstand,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:46:29 2015 UTC,"No, I am not attracted to a man's body at all. I absolute dislike penises for instance. I don't like the sight and the feel and the taste and most definitely not in my mouth. I can find their face very attractive, shoulders and upper arms, but that's about it. And hair, ugh! So, no a man's body in itself does not really do a whole lot for me. That said, I can really fall in love with men and enjoy having sex with them. I do like (well, ok, love haha) the feeling of a penis inside me, and kissing always does a whole lot for me. And even though the body in itself doesn't do a lot for me, the way someone behaves does. Not only if he's nice (which is a must) but more the way he moves, the way he looks with his eyes, the way he smiles etc. So yeah, despite the fact that the body is not doing a whole lot for me, I can be highly turned on by a man and by having sex with him. And I most definitely can fall deeply in love with a man and have a long relationship with him. And I even don't mind his penis, because I know it excites him if I do things with it/to it, and that excites me. I like a woman's body better. But that's not the only criterion to be with someone. I am now married to a woman who is very short and very fat and not really very pretty. I love her to death and I love love love everything about her. So I am attracted to her body not because her body is pretty or beautiful but because it is HER body."

I like guys that are more like joseph gordon levvitt. I feel a strong romantic connection to them and definitely an attraction. I think I am also scared of overly muscular guys and find male sexuality to be a little aggressive too which honestly does scare me. I think I need to work on that in particular in therapy beucase it may be due to my upbringing."

""Sex not being that important"" to the other partner is the kind of thing that can eventually break up relationships of any type, especially if it is important to the other partner. Nobody wants to feel unloved because their partner doesn't find them desirable.            I'd work this out, and not be spending lots of money on rings. Getting the most expensive diamond rings possible will not prove your love, it will only put you in debt on something that has no resale value."
bisexual,396i1i,plantstand,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:19:42 2015 UTC,I told him I want sex about every other day and he said that's fine so do i. I said I love getting him off but I might have to fantasize a little to get off myself. He was a little hurt but seemed to be fine. As long as he takes care of his hygiene I find sex to be good. It may lack that spark that a women could give but is full and deep and very intimate. Sometimes when I'm drunk I do get lustful
bisexual,394ztd,randomlettersinorder,3,Tue Jun 9 08:19:04 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you don't really care that you're bi, like it won't make a difference? That may be true if you only ever pursue straight cis relationships. People of color do get more abuse for being queer, too, and staying closeted is safer, unless being closeted is a factor in your depression. So there is nothing wrong with staying safe. But when you do feel like you're in a good place, and you want to date or hook up or experiment in any way, then just follow your nose…   But for now, I think it might be good if you saw a bi-friendly therapist. You probably already see someone for your depression, but if you want to talk about being bi and how it might factor in, you want someone who will be compassionate about that topic. Local LGBT centers can recommend good therapists in your area."

So far nearly all of the people I try to meet always end up turning out to being awful liars or they get disappointed with me and move on when they realize I don't carry myself like a stereotype. On the subject of seeking therapy, I tried talking with a therapist years ago but that didn't really end well. I've been going for years without seeing another one due to money issues and trying to keep busy. I haven't officially been diagnosed with depression but at this point its obvious I suffer from some form of it."
bisexual,394ztd,bicoastaltoo,2,Wed Jun 10 04:20:24 2015 UTC,"You have just made an important step in the right direction.  Coming out to yourself is the first step in self acceptance.  I know that when I concluded that I was bi, not gay, not straight, and that there was nothing wrong with being bi, my life started becoming far less complicated.  I second /u/aoeui-dhtns recommendation.  There is a great advantage in discussing your feelings with someone who is non-biased and is free of any involvement with you."

I see what you mean, I guess I would just love to see a movie where bisexuality is affirmed via a gay romance. I would have ordered this movie in triplicate if she started a f/f relationship with the other girl. Trans lesbians are an extremely underrepresented group, which is strange as hell considering they kind of seem like the majority everywhere I go, but I think this is because there's always this air of ""what does this mean for cishet men"" going on in media and society, I don't know. It's more of a trans issue I'm having than a bi one to be honest. <<;;"

Regardless of any romantic motivations, it feels good to tell people you're close to - they'll know you better, and they'll feel more comfortable coming to you with their stuff, too. Friends tell each other secrets. It helps. I don't think it can hurt to tell him you're bi (he sounds very accepting), but I would probably hold off on telling him your interested in him until BOTH of you are very clear on each other's sexuality. If I were to guess based on what you've said, it sounds like he's kinda working on figuring out if he's straight, too. If he is gay/bi/pan - hurray! If he doesn't come out to you, you've got an even closer friend and straight ally. This is a win-win. Excited for you - let us know how it goes!"

I have never had any friend, male or female, that has pinned me up against a wall when I wrap my legs around them, then again I have never been that forward.

I think I just won't have any peace of mind until I tell him that I'm bi and then go from there. Because I have no idea how he'd react to me telling him that--whether he'd be surprised and pull back, be like ""okay whatever"" and continue normally, or if he'd jump on me, haha."
bisexual,393czh,TobiwithanI,2,Tue Jun 9 05:14:15 2015 UTC,"Your friend sounds pretty accepting so go for it. I find that conversations about love lives/relationships come up eventually with some one-on-one time with friends, so you can probably casually slip it into conversation, something like ""nah, haven't hooked up with any girls or guys recently"" etc, etc, etc.  That way he can either silently acknowledge it, or ask you about it so that you can confirm and maybe talk about it."

bisexual,393czh,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,3,Tue Jun 9 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of telling him during the trip, maybe right before we go to sleep or on the way home. I just don't get much alone time with him--usually he's surrounded by a ton of people all the time. I don't see him becoming uncomfortable with that situation if I were to tell him one-on-one because I'm pretty sure he cares about me enough to not let it affect our friendship."
bisexual,393czh,averageyasp,3,Tue Jun 9 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely tell him, if you think he will take it well. Who knows what could happen ;) The only challenge is bringing it into the conversation without being abrupt."
bisexual,393czh,Wolfie_Ecstasy,3,Tue Jun 9 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"It'll never go as planned, but I've thought of somehow starting the conversation through telling other secrets first or playing a sort-of truth or dare game.

There is definitely a gradient to attraction - most commonly referred to as the Kinsey scale. It's also a sliding scale so you can find yourself moving around on it. Everything you are feeling is perfectly normal and tons of people have felt that way before."

bisexual,390zop,Stjem05,11,Mon Jun 8 13:33:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe you repressed your bisexuality, and now you are giving yourself permission to explore it. However, having attraction to women does not mean you have to break up with your boyfriend! If you enjoy sex with him, if you enjoy his company, if he makes you feel safe and amazing, stay in the relationship. Labels are just labels. I dated an awful dude for a while and thought that I might be a lesbian instead of bisexual. I talked to my gay friends about it, and they said if I was a lesbian I would probably have known already. Some attraction to women does not equal attraction only to women. There is nothing wrong with being a lesbian by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like you might just be bi or bi-curious. :)"
bisexual,390zop,xlightbrightx,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:01:50 2015 UTC,So I enjoy sex because he is very giving and gets me off and I love seeing him get off and something about the lust a straight man feels over a woman really turns me on. But I don't feel that same lust for him in return. Does that mean I am not attracted to him?
bisexual,390zop,xlightbrightx,2,Wed Jun 10 05:48:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one who can answer questions like that. You say you enjoy sex with him, but don't have lust for him... those two statements seem to counter each other to me. It's also completely possible that you are bisexual, but that he is not your ideal partner. Only you can answer these questions, I'm just trying to give the best advice I can with the details you give."
bisexual,390zop,xlightbrightx,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"well let me ask you a question, you say your friends said you would know if you were a lesbian by now. Why is that? How would you have known?"
bisexual,390zop,lotuspunk,2,Thu Jun 11 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's different for everyone, but a lot of them reported almost no romantic attraction to the opposite sex from a pretty early age. Some might have had opposite sex partners and experimented, but maybe they learned pretty quickly who they liked and didn't like. I think the exception to this might be someone who grew up in a household where it was expected to repress these feelings, then they might have tried to put up a front.... Since these gay friends had seen me happy with both sexes they were saying it was probably just a fluctuation or a phase with me. And they were right... I totally married a dude haha!"
bisexual,390zop,xlightbrightx,7,Thu Jun 11 05:08:16 2015 UTC,"I actually just went through this...except I've been married for a year and waited until my fantasy grew so much that I cheated on my husband with a couple of women. He found out, we fought about it, but now we are cruising women together trying to have a threesome. Who knew he'd be ok with it?! I had no idea. I honestly thought he was going to leave me when he found out. Now I feel like we have a stronger relationship than ever. I get to involve him in my fantasies :)  What I regret is lying to him and not telling him sooner out of shame and making him feel like he is not enough for me.

bisexual,390zop,plantstand,3,Wed Jun 10 05:49:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of lesbians discussing situations similar to yours, where they thought they were attracted to men, but this was just because women aren't really encouraged to explore their pleasure and attraction, so they didn't really even know what attraction felt like. They just knew they were supposed to feel attracted to men.  You really just need to ask yourself whether you're attracted to your SO. Do you enjoy physically being with him? Do you look forward to being with him?"
bisexual,390zop,DoNotFeedAlligators,6,Mon Jun 8 13:38:35 2015 UTC,"ITs unfortunately not as easy as that I don't think. I try to think about whether I am attracted to him and I just don't know partly becuase I am not a person who really has Strong feelings of sexual attraction (even towards women. I just have a low sex drive) and partly because of all of the guilt I feel associated with sex.  When I see my bf being tender or talking about he wants kids I can tell you I find him extremely sexy and want to bang him. I find his personality sexy. He has a nice looking face and body. Often though when we have sex I do it just to feel close to him, I don't necessarily want to rip his clothes off every time. I did START out that way though and I wonder if my feelings of intense attraction are just mellowing out beucase we have been together for a while now."

I wanted to make sure that was ok for him, that the attraction was more emotional than physical. He said yes, but I am not sure."
bisexual,390zop,Hard4Dpp,2,Wed Jun 10 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"I would say that doesn't sound particularly fair to him.         He probably figures you're ready to dump him, which is why he was scared. He hasn't thought through that he doesn't want to end up in /r/deadbedrooms. I bet he wouldn't mind a threesome, btw.          And if you haven't done some therapy for your family/childhood/etc, that would probably be very helpful."
bisexual,390zop,honeynutcheerios17,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"If you remain honest and communicative with him about your emotional needs and your kinky passionate needs then it's not unfair to him. He'll need to decide if he can be happy being there for you emotionally without having the benefit of your kinky passion.  Believe me it is so much better that you discuss this before getting engaged or married. Also remember that our passions grow and change over time. Communication between you two is the key, listen to him. You can tell when someone means what they say or says what you want to hear."

I found a girl on OK Cupid, we've been chatting on KIK for a couple days, and it feels really surreal. Like...starting all over again. Pretty scary."
bisexual,392u4a,Artfullyours,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:32:53 2015 UTC,"Scary, most definitely! My wife and I started dating in high school and were each others only long term relationship so neither of us had much experience with meeting people for dating, hook ups, etc."
bisexual,392u4a,Hard4Dpp,3,Tue Jun 9 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"First off, your wife rules. That is very open minded of her to consider allowing you access to a cock.   Secondly, what are you looking for exactly? Are you hoping to just get laid or another FWB and have you discussed the details of an ideal situation with your wife? If she is fine with you getting yours on the side would you be OK if she decided the same some day?   That road could be a long and arduous one if the details are not hashed out ahead of time.  That said, sounds like you are in a good place to meet some folks and just see where things go.  Good luck and be true to what you want."
bisexual,390luh,AlreadyLostOnce,2,Mon Jun 8 11:14:22 2015 UTC,"With a very open mind - fully realizing that you will feel a total mix of emotions before, during, and after.    You may feel guilt, you may not.  You may feel confused, or then again, you may not.  It took (m)e a while to get comfortable in being with guys."
bisexual,390luh,PhasersOnMax,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"Tough call here. If you are just looking for sex with men, you shouldn't have too difficult a time finding that. Location will affect what is available to you. The little town of BFE will have far less gay/bi guys to play with than say, your nearest major population center. Just shear math there my friend.  Be prepared for guys to flake out and make certain that you are ready to suck some cock when you say you are. If you don't show when you said you would you just make it more difficult to find fun. I know when I first tried to find a cock to suck it took a month or so because so many CL guys never got back to me. I finally found a guy that just wanted me to come over, watch some porn, mutual JO, and then I asked if I could get a taste of his cock and he let me at it. That first time took about 30min for both of us to get comfortable, it may take less time with your encounter. Each moment is so different it is tough to say what you will come across. I recommend emailing for a bit though to see if the guy will continue to chat with you, set a time to meet, and go for it. Just remember to be safe and all will be great.  PS. Nothing wrong with being picky if you don't mind the wait. I had a few guys that I did not find attractive write me early and often and I had to let them know, several times each, that they just did not fit the bill I had in mind. I said it politely, but don't let your first time be with someone you settle for. Have the experience you want to have."

Don't get too hung up on terminology, just enjoy the learning process! If there's a CLEAR new direction in terms of your sexual identity it will be (or likely would have already been) clear.

The Feeldoe is something that you can also feel, so you can get sensation from fucking soembody with a toy. https://www.feeldoe.com/feeldoe_toys.html  Also, if you fantasize about being able to ejaculate inside a woman, there is a new dildo designed to simulate that experience with lube: http://www.thesemenette.com/order.html (This toy was originally created to be used with sperm, to help lesbian couples get pregnant. But you can definitely switch it out with lube.)  It sounds as if you might feel gender fluid. http://www.tolerance.org/gender-spectrum"

If you're looking for something that can be really fun to play with for pretend cum, I would look into buying Bad Dragon's Ultimate Fantasy with a cumtube option version in medium firmness along with their Bad Dragon cumlube. It's not only so much cheaper than the Semenette, it works nicer too. :) I can also vouch for Bad Dragon's quality!

bisexual,38xjra,Mekaista,2,Sun Jun 7 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Curious as to why you would think that. A couple of years ago I would have agreed with you wholeheartedly. In bed I am submissive with men but I am in no way submissive (to anyone) outside of the bedroom. With women in bed, it's not as if I think women should be dominated. When I have sex with women, it's not the usual dominate/submissive that I have when I'm with a man. It's more equal, but with me being more dominant. Personally, I don't get turned on by doing to women what I like men to do to me in bed and even though I like a guy to be rough, I don't like the full on BDSM stuff. I don't see how that's a conclusion you can come to by the couple of sentences I wrote."
bisexual,38xjra,pansPoly_pocket,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"Well because thats also how I was with both sexes for a long time before I really ""sat down w myself"" and reflected as to why I think that. I think this sort of sexism super common, esp in the bi community which I am fully a part of. I mean ALL OF US are deeply effected by the society we live in, it has literally shaped us, and the one we live in repeatedly tells us about the ""natural"" submission of women & the ""natural"" dominance of men, which is why i felt comfortable saying what I said. I mean I understand you're saying that how you are just ""feels right,"" for a long time it did to me too. But idk for me personally after I reflected on it I realized it was more a matter of conditioning rather than something i felt was somehow instinctual. We're obviously different ppl but its still worth noting."
bisexual,38xjra,AlligatorMeat,2,Mon Jun 8 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"For me its not about typical gender roles. It mostly has to do with size though. I couldn't imagine dominating my boyfriend who is a foot taller and has 60 pounds on me.

""Trust me. If you sit down and really think about this like I have, you won't actually like those things anymore. That's not who you are. Don't trust your feelings.""

bisexual,38xjra,CharlotteCorday_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:42:07 2015 UTC,"I think you're discounting biology in all this to be honest. I do not believe gender identity and all this is socially constructed. Especially as a trans person. It wouldn't be okay with me to have someone refer to me as a man, but not see a man in the mirror. It's not about my role.  Also, a lot of bisexual men are bisexual mostly because they love feeling ""submissive"" to bigger, stronger men. What would you say about them? Is it internalized sexism or is it just a preference?  Also, there are people like me: I'm a bottom. Through and through. I'm also a man, no matter what my birth certificate may tell you. I find it...almost repulsive to be the top to be honest. It actively turns me the fuck off to think about topping cis men especially. (But on the flip side, one of my favourite things to do is to have a top cis male who identifies as a super femme guy, the more glitter and nailpolish the better.)  Of course there is a lot to be said about the social constructs of gender roles and clothing and whatnot, but even if someone's preferences are somehow socially constructed, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to sit down and ""have a talk with yourself"" and suddenly find out you want to be Miss.

Like I said, I love my vadge, so I'm def not trans, but I would totally add a dick to what I've already got if I could. I identify as gender fluid, so that's something you may want to look up.

So it's useful to take labels and self-identifiers with a grain of salt and keep in mind that they can only say so much. Humans are creative and complicated.

bisexual,391je3,Hard4Dpp,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"I do recommend some grooming the nether regions at the least. It can't hurt to trim that stuff up and I definitely suggest you shave your balls constantly for a bit. They will itch from the start, but after a bit they will just be smooth and not irritated by the shaving process.  So are you wanting to try everything from both perspectives? I mean are you wanting to fuck a guy's ass as well as get fucked? More experienced guys will be able to take quite a pounding no matter you size and some will be novices in that department.  Additionally, someone else already said it but let me reiterate the importance of trying a good size dildo in your ass and really bounce on it for a bit. Most guys are going to want to fuck for 10-30min and after about 5-8min of being hammered the average guy is going to want to cry uncle. You are going to need to let your top know your limits.  Another important suggestion is lap up quite a bit of your own cum before sucking cock to completion. You need to decipher if you actually like the taste before you get a mouth full.  Lastly, wear protection no matter which side of the cock you are on. Always play safely, regardless of what your new found friend may want to do.

bisexual,392an3,IrishCynic,5,Tue Jun 9 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"Errr...okay, speaking as a trans person (trans man, so opposite to what you're into, but still), trans women aren't usually into the whole ""being looked at as a fetish"" thing, which is exactly what you're doing. You're placing an extreme amount of importance on genitalia, the combinations thereof, and whatnot. There is a huge not-so-nice history of cis men using trans women for a variety of reasons:   Testing their bisexuality. Yeah, I know, but they get used a lot for this. Being used as a walking cock, especially because men usually want these women to top, which the vast majority of trans girls don't want to, and even when they do top, they usually limit it to cis women, trans women, and sometimes trans men if they're into guys as well. Topping a cis man is something different psychologically for many trans women. Being used as a ""taboo"". They're hot because they're seen as ""other"" or ""different"". Something naughty, something to check off the sexual experiment checklist.   While you may not be doing #1, and I'm not sure about #2, you definitely fall into the ""fetishizing"" category, which isn't going to get you many points.  Look, we can't help what turns us on. Trust me, I'm a trans guy and I'll be completely honest here: Other trans people of both genders turn me on because I find the body combinations hot. They seem like something out of mythology to me.  That being said, I would never knowingly sleep with someone with the expectation that they would use their genitalia how I wanted, let me touch it how I wanted, or would be any sort of ""futanari or cuntboy"" fantasy of mine. I know I don't want others treating me like that, and therefore I don't treat others that way. I've slept with other trans people before, and every person is extremely unique in how they want to be touched, how they want to touch me, etc.  I think you might need to perhaps...humanize these women a bit? Trans porn is not the place to be getting your ideas from."
bisexual,392an3,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"Firstly, i'd like to apologise if I offended you. It's not my intention to be disrespectful to anyone of any gender or sexuality.   Secondly I realise the way I've written this suggests it's purely sexual. This is purely because I've never had the experience so I guess that's where I feel the need to be satisfied. I just want to point out it would go waaaaaaayyyyyy more than just sex. I'm a very physical person and I wouldn't just stroll in, have sex then disappear. I would be interested in that person for who they are, were and who they wanted to ultimately be. It wouldn't be just sexual.   What I'm trying to say is I'm in a relationship with a female at the moment, but if I wasn't then the gender of someone wouldn't bother me. I would have a healthy relationship with a guy or a girl or someone transitioning hence the reason for my question. I haven't had any experience with someone transitioning (live in a small town and it's not something you would experience here) but I would be interested in forming a relationship with trans people too.   I worded it wrong and I realise I've probably caused offence to more than just you and you were probably the only one who had the calm and reasoning to put your point across without calling me a dick as such.

bisexual,392an3,TheLonelySamurai,3,Tue Jun 9 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"Firstly, i'd like to apologise if I offended you. It's not my intention to be disrespectful to anyone of any gender or sexuality.    Nah, you didn't offend me at all mate. :) Like I said, I noted that we can't help what turns us on.  As for the rest of your notes: I completely understand what you're saying, and I do see that you mean you would want more than just a sexual relationship, so let me point a few things out if you ever were not in a relationship with a cis woman.   Most trans ladies really aren't into their penis. This is just a heads up. Straight trans ladies are extremely unlikely to want to use their penises in a sexual interaction with a male. Also, often their penises do not get erect like a cis male's does, so even if they're okay with touching, you're likely not going to get the same experience as a man owning that penis. The girls in porn are...well, really mistreated a lot of the time I'm kind of sad to say. Often these girls are one of a few things: In early transition(you'll probably notice that a lot of these trans girls have really tiny breasts buds if they haven't gotten implants? That's because they aren't done ""growing"" yet), they use drugs to temporarily get an erection, or they stop hormones for about a week before the shoot. None of these things are very kind on a trans woman. I have a friend who used to do trans porn and she told me it was like hell on earth when she got to the point that she needed to stop hormones in order to maintain an erection through a porn shoot. Depression, anxiety, she said it felt like she would temporarily gain a mental disorder. Just the fact that you're preoccupied with these ladies' genitalia is enough to send most of them running. That's the reality of it. Most trans ladies want someone to like/lust/love them despite the fact that they have a penis, not because of the fact they have one. This plays into the fact that having a penis is often transitory in a trans woman's life. She may be ""pre-op"" right now, now maybe in 2 years she'll have a vagina.   That's all I've got OP. Just remember we can't help what turns us on, so that's definitely not what I'm trying to get across here. Its just that your arousal is directly at odds with the group you're aroused by, sort of if someone came on here and started gushing about how much they loved Asian people, and listed a bunch of stereotypes Asian people didn't like as the reason why. It's kind of like that.   I worded it wrong and I realise I've probably caused offence to more than just you and you were probably the only one who had the calm and reasoning to put your point across without calling me a dick as such. So thank you. I apologise once again if I've offended you or anyone else.   Again, chill man, it's no big deal. You didn't offend me, and I'm glad the situation isn't as fetishized as I first thought it was. :)"
bisexual,392an3,LauraKy,2,Tue Jun 9 09:27:17 2015 UTC,Not a single bisexual organization defines bisexuality as binary.  Bisexual is being romantically and/or sexually attracted to more than one gender. Pansexual is being romantically and/or sexually attracted to all the different kinds of genders.  So pansexual is a sub flavor of bisexual and you can wear either or both names.

But it can be a handy way to characterize yourself for a conversation. I wouldn't rely on it for identity.   What you're saying isn't unusual. Plenty of straight guys like anal play. But I wouldn't be surprised if you liked more kinds of guys once you got some experience. It can be kind of like being a teenager again; your tastes will mature but not without exposure.   Basically, do only what you want to do, and be safe, but then err on the side of adventure :) You might find that guys are not for you and at least you can say you gave it a shot. Or you could be pleasantly surprised. Maybe you're just straight and kinky. Maybe you have some gender variance. Maybe you wish everyone had dicks but in practice you like cis women the best. Forget about categories and go explore your individual feelings."
bisexual,38yuj7,aoeui-dhtns,6,Mon Jun 8 01:39:40 2015 UTC,"You can be straight without being 100%, ew-dicks-are-gross straight.  It's not a binary proposition.  Labels exist to give a quick and approximate explanation, not to define you in every detail.  Occasionally entertaining thoughts of kissing (possibly girly) men does not mean you're gay.  An interest in pegging does not mean you're gay.  Or bi.  Or anything you don't want to be.  Fucking another man doesn't even necessarily mean you're not straight; after all, plenty of gay people have had heterosexual sex.  I have, at times, identified as straight, heteroflexible, and bisexual.  I find it helps to think not in absolutes (""I have a very very small interest in possibly maybe exploring something with a dude as long as he's not too dudish, therefore I can't be straight."") and instead think of it like this: What is the most accurate label? The closest approximation?  It's OK if 'straight' or 'heterosexual' or 'bisexual' aren't perfectly spot-on.  And lastly: sometimes orientation shifts a bit, gradually, over time.  You might find that, months or years from now, you're more interested in guys, or that you've gone all the way to guys-are-icky territory.  This is perfectly normal, and don't stress about it.  You aren't married to a particular label, and you should feel free to change it whenever you feel necessary."

They Kinsey scale is still in use in the sense that it's one of the best tools that exists, as far as I'm aware. However, it was only originally intended to be a measure of how many men vs women you've had sex with, etc. However, now it's more popularly used to mean who you find yourself attracted to on a regular basis, which I guess is close enough? (Idk I'm not a clinician)  You're experiencing life. haha That's what you're experiencing. If you want to explore it, explore it by all means. If you don't want to explore it, don't.

Also, I lived in San Francisco on the edge of the Castro district for several years in my 30s, and saw a lot of the sometimes broad expression of gay sexuality. While I totally supported their freedom to express themselves and appreciated the culture, I felt like it wasn't me.

The only time I didn't swallow was when this one guy grabbed my head and pushed it down suddenly as he came. I gagged and it ended up all over his stomach and dick. Ha ha.

I knew I felt something ""more"" toward/about them but I had literally zero support at home or with the two friends I had, so it got pushed down.  High school came around and I met my first openly-gay person who became a lifetime friend.  He explained essentially ""you love who you love, sometimes it's just the opposite sex, sometimes it's just the same sex, and sometimes it's both"".   It took me meeting my wife to even get a slight handle on it since she made no bones about her bisexuality.  She always had her suspicions I was too, but never pushed it or treated me any different for it.  It wasn't until my best friend Dave died 4 years ago that I got it.  For months after his death, I cried a lot, almost daily every time I thought of him.  One day I was analyzing WHY, and it hit me: I loved him, I truly loved him.  I started laughing uncontrollably and ran to tell my wife, I said ""Lili, I love Dave!  I always have.  I am, and have always been bisexual!"".   She hugged me, put her hand on my cheek, said ""Jim, I know.  I have always known.  I have waited for the day you could tell me for more than a decade, I am proud of you and I love you""."

bisexual,38xi09,Kasta_Fire,4,Mon Jun 8 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"DO people ask you that [f]requently? I know I was 19 quite a while ago (9 years!) but that was almost never a topic of conversation. It probably got weird for my roomates when I was drunk and hooked up with a girl...  To answer your question, I didn't until I felt cofortable with my sexuality- about 8 years after my first (and only) interaction with another girl. I'm finally starting to persue a girl to date, so I guess it took 28 years to figure out."
bisexual,38xi09,Artfullyours,3,Sun Jun 7 18:57:26 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand how your premise matches your conclusion. Sexual orientation isn't based on who you have had sex with. It's who you are sexually attracted to. If you're sexually aroused by both sexes, you're bisexual. If you're sexually aroused by both sexes but haven't had sex with anyone, you're a bisexual who is also a virgin. If you're not sure who you're sexually attracted to, well, I'd suggest either wait and see (perhaps that has yet to kick in), or experiment (and please be open and honest to your sexual partners about that)."
bisexual,38xi09,Riahlize,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:01:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, see, I know I'm aroused by girls, made out with a few, but I don't get aroused for guys. I have a guy who I love, would kill me if he left, but I'm not comfortable about sexual activities with him. Does that make me bi, or straight and confused?"
bisexual,38xi09,Phionex141,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"At a guess, you could be heterosexual and either bi-romantic or homoromantic.  Or you could go with ""bi and confused"". Honestly, that probably sums up most of us pretty well :)"
bisexual,38xi09,Kasta_Fire,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:20:06 2015 UTC,Just say you're bi. If you say bi-curious you risk confusing people and having to explain it all out. I've known I was bi since about 15 but was closeted until about 7 months ago when I started dating a guy.
bisexual,38xi09,Drake5271,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm male, married and bi. I wasn't sure I was bi until after I married my wife. I'm quite sure I'm sexually attracted to men, despite not having had sex with one. I mean, if you were a gay virgin, you wouldn't be less gay."
bisexual,38xi09,pen1spant1es,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"At what point did I say I was bi? As soon as I came to ter[m]s with the fact that I was sexually attracted to both men & women. The point of acting on either attraction with another person was irrelevant for me personally identifying as bisexual.  What you choose to tell other people is of course a different matter if you feel concerned for your safety (physical, job, or otherwise). But if this is a decision between ""bisexual"" and ""bicurious,"" and you want to answer openly and honestly, choose the one that feels most accurate to you."
bisexual,38xi09,flyingelevator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:24:12 2015 UTC,"If you identify, you can say that's what you are. Same thing. There is no ""homocurious"" or ""transcurious"" or ""asexual-curious"""
bisexual,38xi09,aoeui-dhtns,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm well when I would admit it to others is different from when I started admitting it to myself. I knew I was attracted to both in my hormones teens 15 ish, but chose to only show interest in guys. I honestly thought everyone felt attraction to both, and ended up picking one. And so I decided to be straight, considering being non-straight is a sin and stuff. So I didn't identify as bi at the time, but looking back I can tell that even then I recognised the possibility of being with either one. ""Lost my virginity"" (it's such a weird expression, anyways...)  at 18 to a guy, and had a few other male partners after that.  I started openly identifying as bi when I started fooling around with this girl, also bi, a few months before we made it official. In a couple weeks we will have been together a year now.  Everyone's got their own story, and how you identify or if you choose to change how you identify is entirely up to you."
bisexual,38xq8s,carrot-suicide,5,Sun Jun 7 19:07:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest: From my perspective coming out always was kinda stupid. I get why it's a big thing for a lot of people, but I personally never really gave a fuck. I haven't really experienced homophobia in real life because I come from a very open city and family. I came to terms with deciding that I wouldn't lie if I was explicitly asked if I was bi but I also wouldn't say it if I wasn't asked, just because I don't think anyone needs to care. (Why should they? They certainly wouldn't if I was hetero. ) But and that's a big But: If it is a burden for you or you just want them to know, by all means do it. But be confident. I obviously don't know your parents but I'm sure many people would brush it off as nonsense considering your age (wich is bullshit by the way; if you know it you know it regardless of age). Good luck and Greetings."
bisexual,38xq8s,Wicsome,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:39:23 2015 UTC,"No-one that i've mentioned my sexuality to seems that surprised, and I guess that also comes from my area being pretty open~ I'ts not something that I consider a burden, but the only thing that gets to me is the thought that i'm lying to my parents. And I know i'm not, and I shouldn't have to tell them, but there is always something niggling in the back of my mind.   So I guess I might well do it after my exams are over, but if I dont feel comfortable I'll probably leave it ^  thank you~"

The only way you can do this without being a douche is to be totally upfront about what you are looking for. ""I'm looking for a bisexual woman because I'm interested in having FFM three ways""   Of course, you need more than one hot bi chick for a three way. So let me know how it goes, finding two unicorns who are satisfied with knowing you are only interested in what they can do for you sexually."

For one thing, most people, regardless of orientation, are still attracted to other people besides their partners even when they're in LTRs. Bisexually-specific, it's natural to long for the gender that you can't have. It's not easy, but there's unfortunately really nothing you can do about it. :( Sorry, wish I had some helpful advice…"

Then, proceed as you would with literally any person. You don't have just one approach you use on most girls because they're straight, so why would you need a special approach for a bi person? We're just people, dude."
bisexual,38xo77,TheStarkReality,-3,Sun Jun 7 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"I just think the overconfident approach wouldn't work that well with a bi girl. Given that she's not solely into males, I'd imagine she responds differently than straight women to different approaches."

I don't know how to explain it but I didn't really feel him even though he was a decent size, and he came just as I was starting to feel good. I enjoyed his enthusiasm more than the physical feeling I got from the fucking.  Honestly my favorite part was the initial penetration and the tension leading up to it."
bisexual,38tc2h,mikasasukasa,3,Sat Jun 6 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"The psychological sensation of pleasing the partner or being dominated is for some total bottoms better than the actual physical feeling.

I had fantasies about being with a guy for a long time, but thought I'd probably not really be into it in reality. I discovered that I really like giving head, and a dildo in the ass (haven't experienced a real cock yet) gave me the most intense orgasm of my life. It made my whole body shake and tingle, and my vision went blurry for a few seconds... seriously. It was in-fucking-tense.  I'm sure part of it was mental. A whole lot of built up anticipation and all that, but the physical sensation of being penetrated felt amazing to me... after a minute or so. At first it was a bit uncomfortable, but the pleasure ramped up unbelievably fast."

So, all that extra blood makes it more sensitive, which means more pleasure. That's my guess.  Maybe try putting on some porn? Another thing that helps me is jerking it as well...the pleasure seems to radiate into my body when I do both prostate and penis stim. Maybe try that too?"

bisexual,38tc2h,keakealani,12,Sun Jun 7 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think the first experience was actually better than the next few. As it turns out, anal sex isn't that much different than the rest of it.   It can be good or bad depending on a variety of factors including experience, mood, compatibility, etc.   I'm also going to throw another point in the ""they always cum when it's starting to get real good"" column."
bisexual,38tc2h,Kitsunami,9,Sat Jun 6 18:30:13 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite. I always considered myself a top because even though I had played with myself with a small vibrator I never thought I could enjoy something the size of a cock in my ass.

Otherwise, it's like you're trying to pull it in, which, if you've ever done while shitting, is hella uncomfortable."

I recognize it being a different thing but I'm a woman and the first time I had PIV my experience was similar to your description...It turns out I didn't like the guy much which could have had something to do with it...the sensations have very much intensified since...Not that you should continue to do something that doesn't feel right...but it could get better

Which hell that hurts but I respect it Bc it's truthful .. but I think even tho she wants to be with men now, if she went back to men after me she would highly regret it.. I don't think she's making this decision just based on sex with a man, I think it has a lot of aspects, the normalcy of it, her grandparents being ok with it, just a lot of little things adding up.. I'm the type of person that fights for what I love but realistic speaking how long can I be unsure of her also? Our therapist said to try a open relationship and it might help things.. I'm a highly minogamist person once I love someone.. so for someone to tell me I'm allowed to sleep with other ppl  isn't kool with me really.. I wouldn't have minded that in the beginning but after years of being together to me it seems like I'm a accessory now instead of #1."

I think you really need to get to her root desires on why she wants to be with a man. If it's for the normalcy of a ""straight"" relationship that would make me question, but if it's to start a family then where would you fit into that? Your last sentence kind of sums that up."
bisexual,38u7mi,aQueerFear,6,Sat Jun 6 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"Difficult situation. You are still financially dependent of your parents and they are not accepting of your orientation. That's really the key issue, even if it may not look that way to you.  Your current boyfriend's former homophobia could have been influenced by a parent or his peers. Folks change their viewpoints more easily when they are younger. Not really a concern.  However, if you come out to your boyfriend, what are the chances that word will spread and your parents will find out again? I would be much more concerned about that than your bf's reaction.  I know it sounds like an eternity, but as long as your parents are not accepting and you live under their roof, it is safer for you to keep this to yourself.  Good luck."
bisexual,38u7mi,MyNameIsBarbarianna,2,Sun Jun 7 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think about word spreading again. We keep a lot of secrets with eachother. Him being both my boyfriend and my bestfriend there is a lot of longtime trust. Plus we've told eachother so much about ourselves that could get us in hot water with either of our parents. I honestly think it'd be able to stay secret.   However, I am definitely not in a safe place to be out and in danger of my parents finding out again. I will definitely be thinking about this. And honestly another legitimate reason not to tell him right away has calmed my nerves somewhat hahah. Thanks"
bisexual,38t74y,rlevant,29,Sat Jun 6 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"Sweetie, she's at a very different place in your life from you. She's been around people who dehumanize alternate sexualities. Her attempt to ignore that aspect of you is to reconcile the opposing conflict in her head. You're her friend, but you're not straight, which makes you no longer a viable friend, either from a religious or familial stand point.  The thing is that she's yet to gain empathy for gay people due to her lack of exposure. You may be the first she's met, so show her you're a human, and that who you are isn't disgusting or less than human. Make her confront that or she may not be worth keeping around.  Course, my advice may be wrong, as I don't know your friend. Please make sure it applies to your personal context.  As for your upcoming date, don't sweat the small stuff and have fun. Laugh when you want to, smile when you want to and flirt when you're terrified. If you want a relationship, a kiss or even a hand to hold, express that interest without pressure.  A no doesn't mean anything more than that. It isn't a reflection of you but rather a window into them. Good luck on your date!"

But I'm scared that she may never completely accept me, and most of her dislike for gay and be people comes from her dad who really anti gay anything.  Also thank you so much for the date tips, I hope it will go well since it's my first real date with a girl. Thanks again ♥"
bisexual,38t74y,NEWAY12,54,Sat Jun 6 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"If she can't accept you for who you truly are, then she isn't really your friend.  A real friend would accept you completely.  You should explain that this is who you are, and tell her that if she can't accept this part of you, then you can't be friends.  I'm sorry that it's not great news, but you'll be happier when you find friends that like you for who you really are and don't try to change you."

Your friend is having trouble with contradictions between her own experience and what she's been taught to believe. It's going to take her time to work through that and you should try to do what you can to help. You shouldn't try to change yourself, but I don't think you should try to press the issue, either. Eventually she'll have to resolve her issues but try to let her do it at her own pace.   PS - There's plenty of great people here to ask for dating advice (not me, but a lot of others!). Give it a shot if you're worried :)"
bisexual,38t74y,CockWorshipper77,13,Sat Jun 6 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"she said that she's okay with it as long as we don't talk about it because it disgusts her.   Let that line sink in for a second. You bare your soul to her and share your most guarded secret, and she basically tells you that who you are is disgusting. ""Being ok with it"", and being a supportive friend are completely different things. ""Being OK with it"" is giving conditional support. ""I accept you, as long as you satisfy X condition"". That's not how friendship is supposed to work."

bisexual,38t74y,aoeui-dhtns,3,Sat Jun 6 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"It sucks, but you can't expect people to change sometimes. You can give her more time to accept it, but I would absolutely refuse to ""not talk about it"". That's not healthy for either of you."
bisexual,38t74y,derpderper,3,Sat Jun 6 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"Life is long. You've been friends for 11 years, and maybe you'll be close again, but if that is going to happen she needs to adjust and that might take her some time. One of my high school friends reacted with disgust initially but twenty years later we are past it. It took some time and we both had work to do. I think the best thing you can do right now is focus on becoming more and more comfortable with who you are and telling the truth about yourself wherever you can. I don't mean just sexuality-wise.

You're doing the right thing by exposing her to the truth-that queer people are people and that religion does not provide universal truths. It might help her down the line although she's reacting the only way she knows how- by trying to find you a boyfriend or pretend you're straight. Good luck, and put your needs first!"

If she's still hurt that you cheated opening the relationship isn't going to help, and could make things much worse. Go check out /r/nonmonogamy , read as many books on the topic as you can (opening up, the ethical slut, etc etc), and make your current relationship as strong as it can be BEFORE doing anything. You need very open communication and a lot of trust. You also need to set out rules together of what is and isn't okay. Is sex okay but love isn't? How much time can you spend with others? Is sex in your bed okay? How long should you wait between sexual encounters with others and with your girlfriend? Work out your wants and your needs and have her do the same. Decide how you're going to meet each other's needs within the new relationship dynamic, and how much you're willing to compromise wants (if at all)."

She took it well at first but after processing for a few hours when I wasn't with her, she had a mild breakdown.  After being open and communicating about it, she came to be okay with it and is very accepting.  It's not a topic she wants to talk about and I think she wants to act as if it's never happened, but she would prefer I talk to her about things if I ever feel the need to talk to someone.  It was surprising b/c we had previous conversations where she once said that a guy being bisexual would be a dealbreaker (one of her friends just opened up that he's bi).  I don't know where to go from here but at least it's progress.  But anyways, congrats!"

bisexual,38rmr6,BlkManX,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:18:53 2015 UTC,Are you asking me specifically or is this a grand scheme of things type question???  Truth is its all been very confusing for me... I have been attracted to other men before and constantly check guys out and such. I've never had sex with another man but the thought of it turns me on beyond belief. Like I said in a previous post - I have never acted on my attraction to men so it leads me to question if I am bi or not because I don't have that experience. All I know is I find both sexes attractive... They both turn me on so I decided I had to talk to her about it  As far as an open relationship... I'm sure at some point I'd like to experiment... At the moment I don't really care for an open relationship.. I love my fiancée and she's enough for me... If later spent the line she mentions an open relationship for me to experiment I would be down
bisexual,38rmr6,TheLonelySamurai,-1,Sun Jun 7 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"More in the grand scheme of things....I'm not in your situation and I'm not judging, I don't think you should deny yourself of the experience of being with a man if that's what you want and in the same vein your fiancee' shouldn't have to be concerned about you acting on your attraction to other men. You're in a tough position, it's not as black & white as some people may think. In the end you have to be true to yourself first and be cool with whatever you decide to do."

bisexual,38rmr6,BlkManX,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:39:22 2015 UTC,Sexuality and sexual experience are two distinct things. Sexuality is who you are attracted to. Straight virgins are still straight right? Bisexual virgins don't need to 'earn' their sexuality either.
bisexual,38rmr6,TuskenCam,-1,Sun Jun 7 20:19:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not telling him that he has to earn his sexuality whatever that entails, whatever sexual experience he has a desire for he shouldn't have to deny himself of that experience, it's his decision to have it or not. A virgin is a virgin I know many men who lost their virginity ti females and are gay, just because they fucked a female didn't make them straight."

So to put it in your own terms, it is the feeling, not the action"
bisexual,38rmr6,TuskenCam,-1,Sun Jun 7 20:39:00 2015 UTC,Is that you're experience because it may not be his....My question wasn't a general one about bisexuality it was specific to his experience.....

I'm a bit confused, internet debates are always hard to understand the context of a comment.

I don't care if you're bi, straight, trans, whatever, you should be allowed to come and support it!

And wake me up when these people are willing to deal with the two suicides we've had in the last month, the pandemic of suicide we're facing, or the pandemic of intimate partner violence we're facing."

It was probably created by a lesbian. Who is also probably a fucking TERF.   I'm not saying that all lesbians are TERFs (or all TERFs are lesbians) but holy hell there is a correlations between Tumblr TERFS and biphobic lesbians."

bisexual,38p157,theletterfifteen,11,Sat Jun 6 12:19:47 2015 UTC,"Aaaaand this is why I won't get tumblr.  I've been told by a few people that being bi doesn't exist/I'm using it as an easier way of coming out as lesbian/etc. and I've brought het partners to pride, and het friends to pride that were couples, and I know het people that just go because they wanna have a good time with all us fabulous people.  Seriously, anyone who thinks this way, just because a bi person is in a seemingly hetero relationship clearly doesn't understand anything about being anything but mono sexual. Also... Where would this leave gender fluid/other gender identities and other non-monosexual people?"
bisexual,38p157,GayleForceWinds,8,Fri Jun 5 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"By that logic, gay people who ""look straight"" and aren't in relationships, and trans people who 100% pass as whatever gender also shouldn't go, because they won't have oppression in their lives either, right? Because oppression depends on wether or not you're in a gay relationship and wether or not you can pass as hetero & cis? I wonder if they realise they're contributing to the oppression of bisexuals with that lovely little ""you can't sit with us"" type statement.   I get the feeling they wouldn't agree with that.  I'm in a hetero relationship but if my family found out I'm pan, there's a fairly serious risk to my life. Being closeted because your mother might literally try and kill you isn't oppressed enough. Wow."

The ""straight-passing"" thing some people say is so strange to me because, like, gay people are just as ""straight-passing"" if they're not in a visible relationship.  I went to my first pride recently, and posts like this had me kind of worried about wearing a bi shirt, but likely it was fun and nobody really said anything about it. Except one person asked to take a picture of it."
bisexual,38p157,ElCrowing,2,Fri Jun 5 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"That's always been my experience at Pride. I've found that people who have this much of a stick up their ass about ""passing"" and ""cis privilege"" don't really like music and fun and hilarious drag queens. Go have fun, OP, and if anyone gives you shit, tell them to have a shot and loosen the fuck up. Better yet, tell them to keep their politics out of your bedroom, because they're just as bad as Bible-thumpers."

Why is anyone proud of the sex of themselves or their partner? Nobody should be proud of how they were born, because that is just arrogance. I'm rather gay, and I have no pride in it. I'm not proud that I'm a male with another male, that's childish. I'm proud of my actual accomplishments. Maybe it's just me, but I don't participate in Pride events. If we discussed LGBT history and focused on LGBT thinkers then maybe I would be interested, but instead we just act like stereotypes we would otherwise get offended at."

Because sometimes when stuff is hard and people are acting badly about it, you need cheerleaders, and that's important. I don't need it to be about me. But damnit, I at least need to have it be me-neutral. And I hear enough erasure and not-gay-enough casual dismissal that I just can't get over the initial anxiety spike to go.   It's sad. The LGbt crowd is the only time I have an issue with being bi.   So if you do go, know that you're braver than at least one of us.

It disregards the millions of people who are less privileged than them, to live in such an enlightened time with internet connection and global society, where that society grows better by the day - there is no greater time in history to be yourself, whatever that is.  People on tumblr set us back decades, and bring hate and segregation to a world that requires love and acceptance.   I care nothing about pride, but I can see it's important for many.

Read some of the literature on it, and you'll see that it typically, even when 'successful' just forces people so far into the closet they convince themselves they're straight, and often act out asexual attraction patterns. For a bi guy, you might PASS for straight (which you could do without the therapy) but it might also just outright damage or destroy your sex drive, and/or lead to further mental health problems down the road.  Also, it often involves outright psychological and/or physical torture and degradation, and will in all likelihood do nothing about any sense of shame you may be feeling. I cannot un-recommend this enough. If your parents and friends don't/won't accept you, and you can't handle being closeted, then LEAVE. not everywhere is as god-damn conservative as southern Alberta."

The American Psychological Association doesn't support it for these reasons. If you want more info, here's a good overview I found from a quick Google search.  That said, going to actual therapy with a therapist who is experienced in working with bi-people might help you learn to deal with your feelings. Even if you never want to act on them or come out, I find that learning to accept unwanted feelings helps them become less disruptive and invasive.  It is also important to know, that even though your friends and family are not supportive, there are plenty of supportive people out there and finding friends who do accept you can make a big difference in how you feel about your bisexuality.  In any event, good luck and I hope you find a way of dealing with your bisexuality that works for you."

I'm very sorry to hear that your family and friends are homophobic, because I'm sure that you are very close with them, otherwise, and you'd hate for your sexuality to drive a wedge between you and them.  Unfortunately, you have no easy answers before you. I strongly suggest that you branch out of your social circle and seek people who will accept you as you are. If you think you would endanger yourself if you came out to your family and friends, then don't. However, many people who were homophobic in the past have come to tolerate and accept different sexual orientations after close friends and relatives came out to them.  Really, my best and only advice is to take steps to bring more tolerant people into your life, so that you will have social support, regardless of whether you come out to your family and current friends or don't. Your life may be tough right now, and I can't say it will improve very soon, but it will eventually get better once you're supporting yourself.  Worry about yourself first, and don't worry about others' opinions of you, especially over something as trivial as your orientation."

However, the good thing in your situation is that you're bi instead of fully gay. So if you really don't wan't to embrace your bisexuality you don't have to stay celibate for the rest of your life, you ""just"" have to wait until you fall in love with someone of the opposite sex.  Being bi means you like both men and women. However, you can consider gender as just another 'trait'. When you enter a relationship with someone, it's not like you are not allowed to look at other people anymore, you just can't do anything with it (assuming that you not only want to have a straight relationship but a monogamous one as well).   When you are in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, you can't date someone of the same sex anymore, but: nor can you date another person of the opposite sex. When you find a person of the opposite sex, you ""just"" have to group all those people of the same sex you like in with all the other people of the opposite sex you like: very nice but can't touch it. Looking at it this way will make it easier. You don't have to ignore your feelings for people of the same sex, you just handle them in the same way as your feelings for people of the opposite sex who are not your spouse."

bisexual,38r5dm,letter_word_story,2,Sat Jun 6 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to share this stanza of a poem with you. It's by Andrea Gibson.    When I came out to my parents  they took me to a psychiatrist to get my head fixed.   The psychiatrist said, You are not responsible  for your family's happiness.    Being queer, bi, gay... it's not a disorder or a mental illness. At the heart of therapy is addressing issues that make it harder for people to be happy, healthy, and productive. Right now, it is hard for you to be happy, healthy, and productive, but it's not because you're bi, it's because you're facing homophobia in your personal life and from society, and you've internalized it and are experiencing shame.   A good therapist will be able to help you with issues relating to your sexuality, but it will be in the other direction: helping you realize that it's okay to be bi, deconstructing negative internalized messages that are harming your self worth, helping you establish connection with positive role models, and working with you to build psychological tools to help you cope with living in a homophobic world.   You are not responsible for your family's happiness. You are only responsible for your own, and you will only be able to find that happiness if you start from a place of loving yourself. You might need therapy to help, but it won't be conversion therapy.   Source: I'm gay, and I go to a therapist that focuses on LGBTQ+ issues, and it legitimately has made my life much happier."

bisexual,38takp,lespie98,3,Sat Jun 6 18:09:08 2015 UTC,"That's okay. You can be whatever you want to be. The reason they wrote it that way is because a lot of bisexuals try to exclude people like pansexuals, which is totally insane since bisexuals are excluded from explicitly LGBTQ+ spaces all the time.   It's not meant as a re-definition of who you are. You are who you are, and we aren't here to change that. Rather it is an attack on all those bisexuals who want to exclude certain people who are ""not bisexual enough"" in the same way that bisexuals are often excluded for being ""not gay enough."" It is to say ""if you fit this definition, you are always welcome here,"" but it is not to say we will force our identity upon you.  This is effectively a reaction to the exclusion we feel by proactively preventing more exclusion. If that makes sense."
bisexual,38takp,Zhuangzifreak,0,Sat Jun 6 18:26:10 2015 UTC,thanks for explaining it-it makes more sense that way.  Do some bi people really exclude others for not being 'bi' enough?  That's insane :/
bisexual,38takp,Zhuangzifreak,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:46:45 2015 UTC,":-) Thanks.    Do some bi people really exclude others for not being 'bi' enough? That's insane :/   Yes and no.   But it works about the same way as bisexuals who are pushed out for ""not being gay enough."" No one actually says those words, but usually they are suggested. ""Pride isn't for you, opposite-sex-paired bisexuals,"" for example, which someone mentioned on another thread. So they aren't saying ""you're not gay enough,"" but that is certainly what they mean.  In the same way this often happens in the bi community. There are a lot of identities such as ""pansexual,"" ""queer,"" and ""no labels,"" that many bisexuals attack for trying to be ""anything but bi."" The idea is that there are so many bad connotations attached to the term ""bisexual"" that they avoid the term to avoid the connotations. That there is something more real and truthful about identifying as bisexual over these other terms.   Considering this is almost the same argument many gay men have used against bisexual men for why they are ""really closeted,"" that means it's probably not a good idea to use it. Rather, we should be inclusive of all those who are excluded because they are ""not gay enough"" so we do not fall to the same flaws.  If you have facebook, I actually have a conversation I was involved in where a dude wanted to exclude all pansexuals from an explicitly bisexual-and-pansexual-friendly safe space. People like that person are not alone. And we must do all we can to push back against those ideas.  There are many who would want to exclude you if you wanted to join in our spaces because you don't identify as bisexual. I am here to tell you you are welcome to join in our safe spaces anytime. Or not. This is your home when you need it and not your home when you don't. No matter what you identify for yourself, we accept that and accept you; we are here for you."

A few times when I get into it (before he touches my cock) I sort of come a little (im not hard when this happens) and I definately cant get it up after that.   Honestly, this sounds more like nervousness than a lack of attraction. I identify as a bisexual man, with my sexual attraction to women being stronger than towards men. When i've had sex with women in the past, I ran into the exact same problems. The only time it became ""easy"" to have sex with a woman, for me, was when I was dating her for a while and felt more comfortable opening up.  Using weed to help out with your experiences makes sense as well, because inhibitions seem to melt away on that stuff!   I was told by a therapist that I might have gay fantasies but really I am not gay and my body is responding accordingly (meaning because I cant get it up with a guy I am not gay) but my fantasies havent gone away perhaps it is just a fantasy that cannot be realized in real life.   This therapist is wrong...you don't have to be ""gay"" to be attracted sexually and/or romantically to the same gender, which is the entire point of bisexuality to begin with."

Many bisexual people define it as attraction to people of the same and different genders. If you do, then the difference between pansexuality and bisexuality is really just a matter of how the word feels to you and which feels more right.  And just a side note, trans people who aren't nb would be included under men and women and therefore under the traditional definition for bisexuality."
bisexual,38plzn,WooglyOogly,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but my problem is not really about finding a term to describe my sexuality to myself, but a word I could use to best approximate my sexual orientation if I want to convey it to others. So, while it certainly matters which term I feel more comfortable with and how I define it myself, it is much more important for me to know how others would define it, which means the real question would be something like, how commonly people define bisexuality to include the possiblity of attraction to nb people?  And yes, I fucked up there and do not if fact consider non-nb trans people to be something other than men or women, I included that bit due to some half remembered tumblr post from years ago saying something I assumed to mean only pansexuals can be attracted to binary trans people, but now that I think about it that does not sound like any kind of consistent belief that might be anywhere near common, so there really was no point in including it."

Barely anyone is aware of the existence of non-binary people.  If you want to convey the most meaning to the most people, I'd strongly recommend 'bisexual'."
bisexual,38plzn,JustusGS,2,Fri Jun 5 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"While there is a recognized difference between the two terms, I think you can really roll with either and work through these thoughts with anyone who brings them up. I've done that before, where someone asked my sexuality, and I responded with bisexual. They retorted that they were pansexual and based their attraction of the person regardless of gender, etc etc. It was easy enough to simply say ""Yeah I can roll with that too, if I'm attracted to the person, I'm not going to let gender get in the way of that."" And in the same vein, if you're talking to a genderqueer or trans person you find yourself attracted to and classify yourself as bisexual, they probably won't get all up in your grill about it. And if they do, well, they're probably not worth the effort in pursuing either way.  I guess in short, call yourself either. I stick with bisexual because it's more recognized. Everyone knows the gist of it, and if people ask ""Well what about genderqueer/trans people?"" Then you can further elaborate."
bisexual,38plzn,Phaedrus2129,2,Fri Jun 5 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know any bisexuals for whom lack of attraction to trans/nb people factored into their decision to call themselves bi.   AFAIK, there is no agreed-upon distinction between the two terms. Generally speaking, when talking to people outside of LGBTQ communities, ""pansexual"" will be met with total bafflement and ""bisexual"" will be met with some amount of misunderstanding, but at least basic recognition. Within LGBTQ communities, people will mostly understand either of those terms for what they are, and won't assume a lack of attraction to trans/nb people. So I'd recommend bisexual, since it will be most recognizable to straight people, and you already say you feel more comfortable with that term anyway."

I am attracted to men, women, trans men and women, and non-binary people. Gender does influence my attraction, in that I sometimes lean more one way, then the other, and I'm attracted in different ways to different people. But on the whole, the most accurate description of my sexuality is pansexual.  But I identify as bisexual. I prefer the word, and I find that I get less confusion and questions when I tell people I'm bi, rather than pan. It's a larger, more diverse community, and I think the flag is prettier.   So I identify as bisexual. If I'm in a queer space where people are more likely to be educated on LGBT matters, I might mention I'm pan; but that's simply a clarification of my sexuality, not my identity.  The point is, use the applicable term you're most comfortable with and don't fret about minor shades of meaning."

Pansexual, again to me, suggests no barriers like that, any gender any orientation any-which-way.

bisexual,38plzn,sooneday,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:06:52 2015 UTC,"Well I think the main difference is that gender doesn't play at all into pansexual. That's how it is to me anyway, it's like I don't really see someone's gender or I just don't care.  Bi to me is more the umbrella term, which encompasses pan. I sometimes refer to myself as bi just for simplicity at times. Bi also means that you can be attracted to non-binary people, but if the gender is a factor you can still call yourself bisexual.  Edit: Hopefully this helps, see how this sounds to you. Taken from the /r/pansxual sidebar:   Pansexuality encompasses all kinds of sexuality; not limited or inhibited in sexual choice with regards to gender or activity. Pansexuality can also mean the attraction to a person's personality, rather than their physical appearance or gender.  The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the gender binary, the idea that there are only two genders, as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.  You see, we're interested in the tea, not the cup! Pansexuality is not about taking the body out of the equation entirely, but rather, taking the gender out of it."

bisexual,38kwv3,silverdrake3,2,Fri Jun 5 02:47:11 2015 UTC,"How did what go?  The conversation?  Your questions are causing me to examine this and I have discovered some interesting things because of this.  So thank you for the questions. Yes I actively kept my orientation from her.  I kept everything from her because I was afraid she wouldn't love me/like me.  She told her mother a couple of months ago that she thought I was weird, didn't have any friends , didn't approve of her, or accept her for who she was.  Apparently, she started crying.  When my ex was telling me this I was hurt and it made me cry.  It did help me understand her state of mind though and I'm grateful to my ex for telling me. I did a lot of thinking.  I think that conversation with my ex led me through a serious of conversations in the past few months that culminated with that conversation."

It's hypocritical, because whenever a straight person cheats, it's their fault and their fault only, but whenever a bi person cheats, it's because bi people as a whole always cheat.   It's fucking bullshit. My bi partner has always been loyal to me, and I to her. Lately we've been going through some tough times because of her gender identity (long story short, she told me she's FtM trans), but never in 6 years of marriage has she ever told me she desired something else."

If you pass as straight, people will deem you less of a man if you have any queer qualities at all. Women's bisexuality is diminished, whereas men's masculinity is diminished.

bisexual,38mw7c,Oszker,9,Fri Jun 5 07:44:27 2015 UTC,"I think that one of the more harmful byproducts of society's negative view of bisexuals is that we question the validity of our sexuality at every turn of events, in a way that people closer to the ends of the scale generally don't feel the need to do.  If your straight friend said that he had one bad sexual experience with a girl and was therefore doubting that he really did like girls after all, you would think he was nuts. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt, and trust your attractions over your experiences."

bisexual,38mwsb,ou_tis,3,Fri Jun 5 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"Polyfidelity:       Polyfidelity (also sometimes called polyexclusivity) is a form of polyamory where all members are considered equal partners and agree to be sexually active only with other members of the group. The term originated in the Kerista Village commune in San Francisco which practiced polyfidelity from 1971 to 1991.   The community expected all of its members, within bounds of gender and sexual orientation, to be sexually active with all other members, and for exclusive relationships not to be formed. However, this aspect of polyfidelity is not always expected today.     Interesting: Non-monogamy | Significant other | Girlfriend | Celeste West   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

bisexual,38mwsb,angusprune,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"Ehh, sort of, but there are significant differences between them in most peoples' minds. Polyamory is generally being in multiple committed relationships, either a group relationship as OP describes, or individual one-on-one relationships in which members are free to have other, equally committed relationships. An open relationship is generally a single committed relationship, where participants are 'allowed' to have outside sexual encounters, usually but not exclusively with the caveat that the primary relationship be the only romantic/emotional relationship. Swinging is generally when committed couples have sexual encounters of some sort with other couples, either together or by ""swapping"" partners. All of these are forms of non-monogamy."

I started questioning my sexuality and what my experiences meant to me. I had always thought I was straight, had always had crushes on females, etc. It took a few years, and more experience with both genders before I was comfortable calling myself bisexual.  If I had to offer any advice, Id say dont worry so much about defining your sexuality with a label. Let it be what it is and wait until youre comfortable with your sexuality before defining it. Just be certain to be honest with anyone that you get involved with and you won't create any issues for yourself."

bisexual,38kldx,Lord_Storm_Crow,5,Fri Jun 5 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"Two piece of advice based on my life experiences.  Firstly, I have a friend that originally thought he was bisexual when he was first coming to terms with his sexuality. Ends up he was really a homosexual.  However, when I thought he was straight, then thought he was bi, and then knew he was gay, I never thought of him any differently.   If your friends are truly your friends, neither will they, no matter what you identify as. If you really want to tell your friends, my vote is to go for it.  Secondly, When I first was coming to terms with my own sexuality, I was pretty confused. One day I was a bit drunk and I told my one friend that I was attracted to both genders and was confused about what this meant about my sexuality. I also told her I thought I might be bisexual.  She simply told me if I was attracted to both genders, and felt more comfortable with the label bisexual than straight, then I probably was bisexual, but I also should be more concern on doing what feels natural oppose to what a label tells me I should do. Form then on I just went with the flow, and shortly afterwards it became very clear I was bisexual.   So honestly just go with it and see what happens. If it's ""just a phase"" you will  know soon enough.  TL;DR 1. If they are your friends they won't care if it's a ""phase"" or not. 2. If you want to know if your bi just go with the flow and see what happens."

Also, seems doubtful by how you described your friends, but still, worst case and completely hypothetical scenario, lets say your friends don't take you coming out well.  Just remember, you being bisexual ,or whatever sexuality you may feel more comfortable identifying as in the future, is their problem, not yours. On the other hand, your problem is that you need better friends."

That is just something you have to figure out as time goes on, but if your confident . . . maybe.   Personally for me it wasn't an amount of time, but an event. I had a guy, who had a girlfriend, come on to me. I was repulsed by him because of numerous ethical reasons, but the fact he happen to have a penis didn't bother. For me that was sorta the nail in the coffin.  Still, I'm not telling you this because you need to have an ""ah ha"" moment to know your bisexual. That was just my experience. You are a completely different person, and when you ""come out"" is really up to you. It's your life.  On a side note, you don't have to tell people that your bisexual. If you start dating guys and girls most people will catch on. Whether or not, you tell people should be if you want to tell them, not because you are suppose to. I mean does our society expect straight people to tell everyone about their preferences? (end of mini rant)  Like I said before, it's your life."

I can see how it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but imho it's better than the pan, trans, ace, or GQ flags in terms of color and design.  One thing to keep in mind is that things look different on a computer or phone screen than they do when rendered in paper or fabric. I didn't really like the bi flag either until I saw actual flags for sale at Pride, where they looked much more natural than on a screen. Then I bought one and put it up on my wall."

bisexual,38kp0c,rob22343,8,Fri Jun 5 04:22:54 2015 UTC,"The design is pretty problematic. I had thought the pink was to represent female attraction, the blue was to represent male attraction, and purple for bisexuality. Yes, gender roles are bad - but given we need symbols: it's a symbol.  Rather, pink is 'gay' and blue is 'straight'. I thought we'd moved passed bisexuality = gay + straight."
bisexual,38kp0c,djb_thirteen,6,Thu Jun 4 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the symbolism was either a purple space between the attraction to a man and the attraction to a woman, or alternatively, being gay and being straight. Kinda breaking down the rigid thinking with our space in-between. I really don't get that sort of meaning looking at the flags with just blue and pink, though."

Ok, back to your inquiry :) I've considered myself ""bi"" since middle school (31f now). I never had much opportunity to explore that-in or out of relationships. I've finally found a partner who is comfortable enough with himself and our relationship to ""grant"" me the option to seek women outside our primary relationship. We had lots of very open, honest and informative conversations about this before progressing.   Like yours- my guy isn't interested in a threesome, either. Though he wants me to feel happy and fulfilled. Our agreements are: 1) our relationship takes priority over a secondary relationship I may have with a woman 2) aside from the occasional sleep over- I keep it mainly friendly. Meaning- I can have sex with my girl friend with benefits- but don't do things with her that I wouldn't do with my platonic lady friends (like get a hotel room or go on a date- although the hotel room wouldn't likely really be an issue with open communication) Basically- I can't let it get weird or overly romantic. That would breech ""rule"" #1.  End rant, sorry! I guess I'm trying to tell you that you aren't alone in this feeling. I'm so thrilled I can explore a side of me I've not had a chance to before.

I do think not being able to discuss this topic with him is a bit unsettling. I've seen many posts and people irl that bottled up feelings for so long for their partners (and at a detriment to themselves) just, kinda overflow eventually.   A strong relationship should be able to handle a frank discussion. A strong partnership should be built on trust and understanding. You said you don't think his ego would survive talking with him about this? That's kinda disheartening. Perhaps the relationship is still too new to breech this topic objectively (sounds like he has plenty of insecurities that you'll potentially leave him for another woman. That's something I think some men can consider a total ego blow). If this is long term potential- I think you need to be able to have these discussions with him. Are you talking with your friends about it? If yes- do you feel guilty about that? If yes- perhaps you feel that's a form of dishonesty? (It would for me)"

He does have some pretty big insecurities, especially when it comes to sex. He has some medical conditions and medications that cause him to have ED. We have found some solutions/treatments that work for us, but he hates that he needs them. He's also older than me and worries that I might leave him for a younger man/woman.

Are you stressed?   Any of these things can reduce your libido. You can also burn out on porn the same way you can burn out on video games or anything else. And these are just the things I know about. You can always talk to a doctor and they might be able to determine if it's mental or physical.

My depression melted away, I felt a rush of happiness and energy (I ran 7 miles that day), and I felt an odd drop in my libido. It was almost like my old sex drive was compulsive like a wire was crossed in my head and when I finally admitted that I am bisexual to myself, the wires uncrossed and I was normal for the first time in my life.

bisexual,38nsot,Kasta_Fire,5,Fri Jun 5 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"The arguments in the article seem really silly. There is already a term by the way ""heterosexist"", which means prejudice towards people who aren't heterosexual.   I think ""sexualist"" would be even more accurate since it means prejudice towards people with a different sexual orientation. Obviously gay people can be heterophobic and bi people can be monophobic.  Then again... the comments are full of literal homophobes so I'm talking about pointless stuff anyway. We clearly have a longer way to go than I thought. -_-"
bisexual,38nsot,pharzon,3,Fri Jun 5 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"homophobia is an inaccurate word: Let's replace it with a less inclusive, more specific, and downright stupid word.  Considering racism is race + ism, gaycism would be descrimination based on gays, not against gays.   And homophobia already describes it perfectly, yes, homophobes do fear homossexuality, they don't fear homossexuals, but they fear their own sexuality, therefore projecting hate towards those that show it.   As the article describes racism is now a better word to describe, well racism, than negrophobia, as racism can be the prejudice towards ANY race, although gaycism wouldn't make sense in that aspect, as homophobes aren't just against gays, they're also against the entire LGBT community."

I find girls who look different than me (are shorter/taller, curvier,  long hair, etc.) more attractive and there isn't really any comparison because we're more different. Similar to how comparison isn't an issue with men because we're normally much different appearance wise.  I completely understand and I hope my post made sense haha!"

If you can, try to surround yourself with people who are more accepting of LGBT people. Even during conversation with some of your other friends ask them how they would react if someone they knew was LGBT. At the end of the day, are they really worth having as friends if they make you feel shit about yourself?   We'll help you as best as we can here, but the decision to come out is ultimately up to you, and you've got to weigh up the pros and cons and make your decision from that.

Remember that its not your job to dispel of others' ignorance.  Youre concerned about coming out and losing your friends, but have you wondered if these people are really your friends? Do you want to associate with a a bunch of homophobes? I wouldnt. But thats me, and youre you, and maybe you have other reasons for being friends with these people. I feel like its important to have friends with whom you can be yourself around. If coming out to them is going to turn them against you then its hard to say that they were ever your friends in the first place. Maybe, as others have said, their remarks are a away for them to establish their masculinity because theyre insecure about it. But youre not. Ultimately, the choice is yours, but hopefully Ive given you a few things to think about and help you make the choice that is right for you."

I will say I never had a bad experience coming out - often friends and family were more accepting than I expected.   It helps others by being out. It might change your homophobic friends - they might stop with the slurs or ask questions. It's helpful to them given they already know you and see you as a normal person - it's great exposure for them to realize they know a bi guy they call a friend.   If you loose them, maybe they weren't worth anything as a friend after all. You probably will be surprised though!  Best of luck - no rush, do what makes you feel good."

I think most guys around your age who make the jokes and slurs do it to show their machoism around their buddies. As we get older and settle into families and relationships we don't need to ""prove our manliness"" and our attitudes change. We have too much other stuff to worry about like fixing the leaking roof or the kid's college tuition bill."

Once you've got a social circle where you're happy, I think you might find coming out a bit easier. It's a symptom, not a cause."
bisexual,38hrr4,sooneday,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"At some point you have to realize that what matters is your happiness. It doesn't matter if you dated a chick, a dude or who your friends were. Although it is 2015, you will be surprised to encounter plenty of ignorance when it comes to sexuality, sexual orientation or simply sex. It is almost as though some of us want to be placed in a box; be represented by a flag, have our sexual orientation listed as an option, but we don't all fit into box. I have heard plenty of times that I am gay simply because I slept with guys, but I truthfully disagree. I have also slept with several girls, so does that make me straight? At some point you will realize that there are people worth keeping around because they are friends and family and what you do in the bedroom, or whomever you find attractive, is not taboo or worthy of causing a riot. I have been with both guys and girls, but I don't let that define me. There has got to be more to life! Try to meet new people, express yourself, be happy, be yourself...I'm sure that sounded corny, but you do not want to miss out on living life. Do whatever makes you happy...so long as you are not hurting anyone in the process! Best of luck."

bisexual,38ibiy,Uncy_Vamps,7,Thu Jun 4 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"I came out to my wife while we were dating and she was very supportive at the time and remains so. About 15 years into our marriage I told her I wished I had a male buddy to bond with and she was more than willing to discuss parameters for me to develop a closed loop relationship with another guy.  The key is complete honesty and open communication. This setup is probably easier for my wife to accept because I am heteromantic; my friendship with my male buddy is not romantic, more just good friends who happen to suck each other's cocks. I make sure I communicate all this with my wife because I would never forgive myself for losing her trust.  Be honest with your girl, let her know exactly how you feel and LISTEN to her thoughts too.  She may be accepting, you may have to compromise some, but you need her to be fully aware and involved if you want her to be part of a life that includes another man sharing your time and emotions."

Honestly how I brought it up was asking if she wanted to know what had been on my mind, and she obviously said yes, so I told her. Her reaction wasn't shock or anything. She just smiled and hugged me and told me in a way she always knew. I'm happy it went the way it did for me and hope it works out as well for you!

What about fortune tellers and shit like that? Are those legal? They are just as fraudulent as conversion therapy.  Couldn't you just label it as normal therapy, and not explicitly say it's conversion therapy."
bisexual,38e86u,Vatnos,9,Thu Jun 4 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"My opinion on this is that sexuality might be changeable to some extent for a much larger percentage of the population than people are willing to admit or think about. I expect to be frustrated by this case and the debates that happen around it, and I expect to hear a ton of biphobic stuff from the ""born this way"" camp, as well as a ton of junk science from the ""ex gay"" camp.  The ex-gay conversion centers are clearly not doing that. ""Praying the gay away with Jesus"" is not going to work. Making grown men strip naked and sleep with their dads is downright baffling... it's always something crazy like that.  It's never just... ""here, masturbate to porn of the gender you want to be attracted to whenever you get horny, and DON'T masturbate to the porn you're used to"". You'd think some place would've tried that one by now but... people are really stupid."
bisexual,38e86u,djb_thirteen,0,Wed Jun 3 23:18:10 2015 UTC,"To me it's so obviously possible, by exactly the means you suggest. And yet the critics insist that not a single person has ever changed their sexuality."
bisexual,38e86u,MURDERSMASH,3,Thu Jun 4 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"I feel super conflicted about G2S conversion.  These services are coercive and abusive. Often kids and young adults are forced to go. Reports I've heard sound like they're pretty horrible places.  On the other hand, there's an undercurrent within the opposition to them that suggests it's absurd there could ever be a success. These places are obviously frauds. That seems like a binaristic, and implicitly biphobic approach. Some people's sexual orientations change naturally, and it's not a massive jump to suggest that with coaching you could change it yourself. At which point, I'm unclear why fully consenting adults can't consent to changing their sexual orientation, any more than their hair colour or gender presentation."
bisexual,38e86u,djb_thirteen,11,Wed Jun 3 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"A couple thoughts about this: first, the methods they use are ridiculous. One method is to strip naked and touch yourself while the counselor watches. Or how about the method demonstrated on CNN by one of these ""ex-gay"" crackpots that involves bashing a pillow with a tennis racket while screaming ""WHY MOMMY WHY"".  Maybe it is possible to adjust your orientation, or maybe it isn't. There is anecdotal evidence of people experiencing fluidity (like me right here! I do), but is it evidence that it can be changed? I don't think so, and neither does the current scientific consensus, as far as i'm aware. So, when these people who are clearly practicing quackery come along and assert that their methods work, I think it's safe to say they're fraudulent."
bisexual,38e86u,maiolz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, the methods are likely fraudulent; they are absurd. That said, that's no proof there could never be a non-fraudulent method.  But the conversation that happens never reaches as far as how absurd the specifics are: the idea is that it's just absurd that anyone ever could change their sexual orientation. That may just be my interpretation of the conversations I hear. But I think there's at least a minority undercurrent in opposition to G2S that's implicitly denying the experiences of fluid people."
bisexual,38e86u,djb_thirteen,3,Wed Jun 3 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between naturally experiencing fluidity in your sexual orientation and artificially triggering it.  Remember that conversion therapy was perfectly acceptable and mainstream for a long time, and lots of different methods (usually far more plausible than the stuff we tend to hear about nowadays) were tried without success.  I don't think it's impossible that a working method could be found, but it's basically science fiction, especially since nobody with relevant expertise (or even common sense) is likely to put serious effort into it in the foreseeable future."
bisexual,38e86u,VDRawr,-1,Thu Jun 4 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"""There's a difference between naturally experiencing fluidity in your sexual orientation and artificially triggering it."".  a) Why is there such a difference?  b) My point is rather, 'sexuality changes naturally, so it seems reasonable to think it can change artificially."
bisexual,38e86u,Jubilee_Street,-3,Thu Jun 4 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"Do you think that hugging some guy (as in your second link) is really so crazy?  If some people have only had physical, caring contact with one sex in a sexual context, is it so strange to think that introducing them to it might desexualise such contact a little?  To me this seems more likely to turn people bi than straight, but that's just a guess."
bisexual,38e86u,Cockwombles,6,Thu Jun 4 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree. I think the issue comes from the fact that there are no reliable records of any of these therapies ever working.

Do not under any circumstances allow them to touch you. Such people should be immediately reported to the administrative organs so that they can be removed from society.""  Fidel Castro termed maricóns (gay men) as ""agents of imperialism"", saying that ""a deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist must be,"" and saying that ""in the country, there are no homosexuals""  The People's Socialist Republic of Albania penalized homosexual relationships until 1 June 1995, often very aggressively (including long prison terms, bullying and ostracism).   In October of the same year, Pasolini was charged with the corruption of minors and obscene acts in public places. As a result, he was expelled by the Udine section of the Communist Party   And few months ago the leader of a small communist party (ex member of the Europarliament) said   Nessuno sconto anche ai partiti che oggi danno vita al centrosinistra, “asserviti al gioco padronale e alla ricerca delle “particolarità” originali (matrimoni gay, abolizione dei generi anagrafici, ecc.)

Sometimes it can make us feel even more lonely because we are so blatantly comparing ourselves with others. I think that that is the caveat that comes with the convenience of it. As a bisexual woman, I can relate to being on the receiving end of prejudice from lesbians. I know that it feels like it just happens to you, but it's pretty common. You can't be everyone's cup of tea. It's hard to come to terms with, but it's important.   I was wondering if you have any trans friends? It might be beneficial to listen and learn from their experiences in dating. They would probably be the most knowledgeable and they could share their advice with you.  You are pretty enough.

As I stated earlier you pass as a woman in your pictures on OKC and are attractive. But you might simply be really self conscious and overly worried about your body (which I expect would be normal for many trans people as you lived most of your life feeling like your body was incorrect), and that makes dating someone hard."

I'm also worried about ending up alone from time to time, but I'm learning to love myself (and made a huge progress already) while I figure things out. And even though I feel lonely, I'm not going to let that defeat me. I want to tell you that I admire you for living life being true to yourself. It's not easy to be LGBT in this world. You haven't fought all these years to surrender now, and I want you to recognize that and to love yourself for others to love you too. If you want to change something, change because YOU want it. You should not change to please anybody but yourself. As for finding friends, date sites might not be a good place sometimes. If you really want to be with someone, maybe you should try looking for pansexual women specifically. Sorry if something's not right or inaccurate, but I really wanted to be there for you :)"

After looking at your OKcupid profile (thanks for having the courage to show us), I think the problem isn't you. You have a wonderful personality and look great. I think the problem is where you live.   Massachusetts isn't really known for its LGBT community, and I doubt it's that large to begin with. If you can, try to move to states (or countries) that are more LGBT friendly with a larger LGBT community. If you can't do that, due to a job or something else, postpone finding a partner.   It's gonna be tough and you're going to be lonely at times, but that's the only way. While postponing trying to find someone, plan on finding a new job in a LGBT friendly state. The west coast of the United States is probably your best bet. Good luck! :)"

I was a star student but seriously depressed.   If you think 44% contemplation is tragic, consider that 46% of transgender people have attempted suicide. A majority do not reach the age of 30.  No one talks about the B and the T, yet these communities are in crisis."
bisexual,38dy0c,SidneyRush,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:41:57 2015 UTC,"Are you still repressing your sexuality? And when you say the word repress, do you mean that you are suppressing your homoerotic urges or that you're just in the closet? They are way different from each other.   And yes, it's tragic how many trans people commit suicide due to society's bigoted views. But look at it from this perspective: gays used to commit suicide because of society looking down upon them, now it's way less common (unless you live in the Middle East, Africa, or a country with a severe intolerance for it).   The same will happen for trans people. More and more people are starting to accept them, and Bruce Caitlyn Jenner's transition is really giving the trans movement a lot of good publicity. I wish bisexuality got more attention, though. It's still a joke to a lot of people."
bisexual,38dy0c,SlipspaceRupture01,3,Wed Jun 3 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Hrm...repressing verses supressing...I mean that I was ignoring it and in the closet. In the closet to myself too!  I don't think I'm still doing that...it's more that it's changed and I don't quite understand if it's real attraction or a phase. I never believed that sexuality could be this dramatically fluid! It's difficult to tease out the cause and meaning of my feelings. The attraction shifted after I accepted my gender identity. I was bisexual and mainly interested in women and now I'm bisexual and mainly interested in men/masculine people. Is it admiration/jealousy of masculine people due to gender dysphoria that caused the homogender attraction to increase? Is it repulsion/disinterest in women, possibly due to dyspohria over their analogous anatomy, rather than a sudden drop off in homosexual attraction to women? I have no idea. I just say I'm queer at this point and I'll let the dust settle where it may. Though I really am attached to identifying as bisexual...I have for nearly a decade.  Do you mean Caitlyn Jenner's transition?  I wish that bisexuality could have it's Ellen moment! The closest bisexuality came to that was Angelina Jolie, I'd say. I guess I'm happy that trans people are getting something similar to that now, and I hope we can change the medical restrictions and archaic legal policies around name changes and gender markers, as cis people learn we're not the boogey monster the media has created. I feel that bisexuality needs a really out-loud activist-type star or a beloved fictional character who lays it all out there. Bisexuality and transgenderism are both very confusing to certain types of thinkers...we need someone to be matter of fact and make all the biphobic arguments look like the ridiculous bullshit that they are...while being a beloved personality. It's a tall order!"
bisexual,38dy0c,SidneyRush,2,Thu Jun 4 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"I used to do the same thing. I tried so hard to suppress my gay side and it ended up making me miserable for 2 years because I constantly had to deny and fight a big part of myself.   I was so scared of becoming gay, it was ridiculous. I was so happy when I decided to accept it. It sounds so ridiculous and outlandish now that I look back at it. One of the biggest regrets of my life.  And yeah, I meant Caitlyn Jenner. I don't mean to sound insensitive, and I'm not saying you're this way, but a lot of people really get their panties in a bunch if you accidentally call a trans person by their previous gender/name. I've gotten so much passive aggressive shit for it. It's kinda hard to do when you've known them as that name/gender for such a long time and sometimes you make mistakes and slip.  Not many bisexual stars and celebrities out there, that's the problem. A part of me likes to believe that there are way more bisexuals than we think there are, and that they are either closeted or don't know that they are bi yet.   It took me a while to realize that I was bi. Before I found out I was bi, I thought ""well I get aroused by guys and girls, I must be either gay or straight. I'm probably just straight though"" and then I'd go about my day without thinking about it. I wouldn't even take bisexuality into consideration. I didn't believe it was real or just extremely rare."
bisexual,38dy0c,SlipspaceRupture01,3,Thu Jun 4 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all that wasted time while trying to be straight...all my sexy, youthful years gone. A major regret here too. D:  It's just a reminder. I am ""that way"" about names and it does sound insensitive to write me off as passive agressive. But here's why we ""get our panties in a bunch..."" because in the same way that people deny your bisexuality, people flat refuse to acknowlege our gender. One of the most painful ways they do this is by using the wrong pronouns and your old name. It's an invalidation of your identity and it causes dysphoria. That's why trans people and trans allies may seem ""passive aggressive"" when they insist on getting the name right, even when they know you aren't messing up out of spite. It's about respecting identities and not causing dysphoria.  I think there are tons more bisexuals and that's why so many ""straight"" people took so long to get used to the idea that gays and lesbians couldn't choose to ""be straight"" when they were able to do so. That's a controversial idea for sure. (running for cover now!)  Haha, I can so relate...I never realized you could just be into more than one sex or gender of people. It was like something that theoretically happened, to people in the movies or in bigger cities. Lol."
bisexual,38dy0c,SidneyRush,2,Thu Jun 4 03:30:56 2015 UTC,"I understand why people would get mad over using the wrong name, but sometimes we screw up, me especially. And I wasn't calling you or people that correct me passive aggressive, I just said that I've had some passive aggressive responses from people.   Being bisexual seemed impossible to me. Over time I learned more and more about it. I only learned recently what caused people to be transgender. I never knew gender dysphoria even existed until a few months ago. When I did though, I was pretty shocked. I feel so bad for the people that are born that way, must be hard.   But like I said before, society is really catching up and learning to accept all this. I guarantee you a decade or 2 from now, people won't bat an eye when you tell them you are bi, trans, gay, whatever.   The media really helps. Even though I dislike the kardashians, I still think that Caitlyn Jenner's transition is great publicity for the movement and I'm glad it's getting an insane amount of media coverage."

bisexual,38dy0c,WoollyHats,3,Wed Jun 3 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly true that bisexual passing creates self-hatred (aka internalized biphobia).   For example, if you tell someone you are bisexual and they tell you ""bisexuality doesn't exist"" or ""no you're not,"" then that is coercive passing. You are being seen as non-bisexual when you are in fact bisexual--passing.  ""Voluntary passing"" on the other hand is often a defense against unjust oppressive system. There is some evidence that for those who do not come out to themselves or those closest to her it can create mental strain, but passing in-it-of-itself probably only plays a relatively small role in the increased rate of suicidal ideation. Please see the book I mentioned above for more information."

In my case, I wished more people could tell...now that I'm transitioning, I'm read as monosexual--as lesbian, and that erasure is just as depressing and frustrating as being read as straight.  When I used straight passing privilege by choice, I didn't ever feel guilty, because I only used it when my safety or job were on the line. Now I use cis-lesbian passing privilege to avoid transphobia. I imagine a few months from now I will be read as a gay man...which will be less false, but still not true. Lol.  I do feel guilty for misrepresenting lesbianism sometimes though, but I don't feel I have to be visible as trans or out as bisexual 100% of the time. I pick my time and place."

bisexual,38g8lf,theosiegel,30,Thu Jun 4 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"Her bisexuality isn't actually the issue. The issue is that she was sleeping with someone else, and continued to do so after you found out about it.  The discussion you two should be having is this: is she oriented toward monogamy? And if she isn't, then are you okay with that (if you're not, then this may actually spell the beginning of the end)? Also, would you be angry if the other person was a man instead of a woman?  If she is interested in maintaining a monogamous relationship, then while you should absolutely support her in working through the fact that she's attracted to and has feelings for women, then you've got to treat this as it is: an instance of infidelity. A lot of marriages survive infidelity, and the fact that you're not angry bodes well, but it's something that needs to be unpacked and teased apart. What were her reasons for doing it? Is it just that she wanted to explore that side of herself, or is there something else going on? If there's something else going on, then that problem (or problems) need(s) to be examined and solved. After that, you're going to have to ask yourself: are you comfortable insisting that this never happen again? If it happens again, are you comfortable with following through with the consequences, up to and including leaving her? You have to figure out what your boundaries are, and stick to them.  Good luck. And I do want to stress again that this isn't actually about her being bisexual. Bisexuality doesn't make people more or less likely to be non-monogamous, so try not to focus on that aspect of what's happened."
bisexual,38g8lf,thetates,6,Thu Jun 4 02:40:34 2015 UTC,I don't really get your comment.  The bottom line is. She cheated on him.  That's what he needs to deal with.  Her being bi or being interested in a poly relationship does not matter .. at least that's how I view it. I would just look at it as she cheated on me. Then decide if I want to stay with her or not. The last thing on my mind would be to introduce poly into a relationship. I just can't see that working out well. I'm not saying poly doesn't work. I'm saying that she broke his trust and it's his decision to either stay or leave.
bisexual,38g8lf,forshow,2,Thu Jun 4 12:18:34 2015 UTC,"She cheated on him. That's what he needs to deal with.  I'm saying that she broke his trust and it's his decision to either stay or leave.   Oh yeah, absolutely! I agree with those points!  I brought up the non-monogamy thing because of how he presented things (he's experiencing confusion rather than anger, and he doesn't want her to be unhappy and unfulfilled in their marriage). It's something that some people do post-infidelity, because when they examine how the cheating made them feel, they realize that they're actually okay with their SO having other partners -- they just want to know about it when it happens. Basically, if he wants to stay, then opening up is just one of the options for moving forward.  Not everyone is cool with that approach, of course, and he might very well not be (he does say he's worried about not being enough for her). That's why I said if she doesn't want to be monogamous and he does, then it's probably the beginning of the end.  Either way, yes, she did cheat on him, and he has to stop focusing on the fact that she's bi and instead focus on how the cheating makes him feel and what he wants to do about it (whether that means leaving or staying and working through it)."
bisexual,38g8lf,thetates,2,Thu Jun 4 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"But cheating isn't even about multiple partners. People in polyamorous/nonmonagamous relationships can and do still cheat on their partners. Even if he's okay with her having multiple partners, she cheated, broke his trust, and lied- while continuing her behavior. I'm not polyamorous, but it doesn't sound like SHE is fit for one. It just sounds like she can't control herself. And no, being bisexual absolutely has nothing to do with it."
bisexual,38g8lf,Jetboots_Rule,2,Thu Jun 4 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"All very true. I mentioned in another post that most non-monogamous relationships have rules, and it's a betrayal when those rules get broken. I wasn't explicit in calling those instances cheating, but yeah, they definitely are. But I can see how I wasn't being very clear in drawing a distinction between cheating and non-monogamy. You're right that they're not the same.   There are marriages that survive infidelity. There are people who cheat once, recognize that it was a terrible thing to do, and never do it again. I'm not saying his marriage will survive, or that she won't reveal herself to be a serial cheater, regardless whether they open up or stay closed. I'm just talking about things he ought to consider if he wants to stay, which it sounds like he does.  I think part of the problem in how I'm coming across is that I hesitate to tell people exactly what to do or how they should feel when it comes to cheating, because different people react so differently to it. I mentioned him being willing to follow through with consequences in my first post; if it were me, then I would give my husband a second chance, but he wouldn't get a third -- he'd be gone after the second time (and, of course, there are people who won't even give second chances. Their SO cheats once, s/he gets dumped). But I've met people who just legitimately do not give a shit. Everyone has different limits and a different bar when it comes to this sort of thing. I can't tell him what his limits are; I can only give suggestions for how to go about figuring them out, and to tell him to stop thinking about the fact that she's bi, because as we all seem to agree, her sexual orientation really makes no difference.  Edit: wording"
bisexual,38g8lf,thetates,2,Thu Jun 4 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"Okay! I hear you. We are on the same page, for sure. I think I may have considered her continuing to cheat after the trickle truth to be her second chance, but that's me. You're right. He has to decide his own limits."

She hid it from you, and then when she did tell you she lied about it. She's not respectful of her relationship with you.   A lot of us out bisexuals take same-sex cheating very seriously because we don't see it as any different from cheating with the opposite sex. If she'd been with a guy this whole time, what would you do? A commitment is a commitment and she pissed all over it."

Getting cheated on sucks for most people in general, because most people want monogamy (eta: and even non-monogamous people set rules, and feel hurt if those rules are broken).  It's not her bisexuality that's making her shitty in this situation. The reason we're ostracized isn't because we're any more likely to do something like this; it's because when when a bisexual person does, it's treated as somehow being different than when any other person cheats. It's not. A cheater is a cheater."

So telling him that I liked him and what not was a big relief. He was supportive of my sexuality and fine that I have/had a crush on him.   He is still my best friend and nothing has changed. You shouldn't be sad for what you said to him. Just be glad you can be who you finally are.   Note: I'm writing this at 3 am so my thoughts my not be as clear as it would be with full sleep.

He is also dating a person. And it doesn't bother me at all as we are best friends and bros. He knows very well that I sorta like him, it doesn't bother him but we just live our lives like we are friends.   I'm only saying this, as he is the only person that knows I'm Bi.

That's great that this guy is being nice, and he might not even realize he's making you uncomfortable, but if you ever feel like you're in a bad situation, it's time to bail.  I came to the realization that I'm bi late in life (I'm 32, very long story), and I've noticed that when it comes to the same sex, I feel...well, like a teenager again: I long liked the thought of kissing and cuddling and above-the-belt stuff, but it took time for other desires to show up.  It sort of feels like I've kept this part of myself stuffed in a shoebox for years, and I've finally freed it, but that was just the first step: now I have to let it stretch its muscles and...""un-atrophy"", I guess is a good word.  There's no need to rush anything: just let your feelings unfold at their own pace.  Also, nothing wrong with not being attracted to most of the men you meet :)  Many people aren't perfectly 50/50 attracted to both genders, and there's nothing wrong with having a 'type'.  2) Don't come out to anyone hostile until you are sure yourself.  It's good that you have supportive friends, people you can talk to and work things out.  But I wouldn't say anything to someone you know is going to react poorly until you can look them in the eye and say with confidence, ""Yes, I'm bi.""  You also don't have to do it all at once!  You can tell your trusted friends first, and then work your way up.  You might even decide never to tell your parents: that's YOUR choice, no one else's, and there's no shame in not wanting to get hurt."
bisexual,38flz9,hyzenthlay1701,3,Wed Jun 3 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's really comforting :) It's completely like being a teenager - I have exactly the same apprehensions that I haven't felt for about half my life!

bisexual,38flz9,Hard4Dpp,3,Wed Jun 3 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"First off, your post is not a garbled mess. There is nothing wrong with just venting. Venting does not need to be grammatically correct or exceedingly coherent [even though your post was quite clear].   Secondly, the gentleman you are chatting with needs to know that you are not particularly interested in anal sex. He won't take offense to it if he is on the level about being your friend in this life changing event.  A few quick questions, which you do not need to answer here. Have you pulled it to gay porn? Did it get you where you wanted to go? If so what part of the porn suited your desires? Were you the more dominant one? The submissive? What are you looking for here? To try sucking a cock for the first time? To kiss a man? There are a wealth of things you may or may not want to engage in and all those things can be discussed with a person that is willing to listen. Do you feel compelled to tell your friends and family? What is the impetuous for doing so? Are you romantically attracted to men? In a perfect world where there is no judgement, could you see yourself dating a man for an extended period?   These are all good starter questions which will lead you to a better understanding of who you are in the bi community and what you want from those experiences, should you chose to pursue any of them.  I did not know I was bisexual [not biromantic here] until I was in my late 20s [I am now in my late 30s]. When I was 28 I mentioned to an ex GF about some fantasies I had and she basically made them happen for me. She was very giving and extremely understanding: she helped me come out of my shell as it were. I have been blessed in that respect. I was able to find out I love sex with men, but never want a relationship with one.  My story aside, I wish you the very best of luck and remember, you are worth exploring yourself sexually, and if you feel so inclined, romantically. Do yourself a favor though. Have sex with a man before declaring your freak flag. If you hate it you will be dealing with a wealth of unnecessary BS for years to come. Try out the fun before saying you are one. Everyone in your life does not need to know everything about you. Remember you are in control of what you wish to experience."
bisexual,38flz9,hyzenthlay1701,5,Wed Jun 3 23:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new here, and I'm totally not trying to step on toes, but...well, it seems a bit unfair to require someone to have sex with both genders in order to be ""really"" bisexual.  Straight people don't have to sleep with the opposite gender before they can call themselves straight, damn it!  No doubt, you'll probably get more pushback if you can't ""prove"" it--people insisting it's just a phase and so on--but that's one of the great things about an identity: it's yours, and you don't have to prove it to anyone else.  Sorry, again, not trying to ruffle feathers; just a different perspective.  (Otherwise, very nice post :)"
bisexual,38flz9,Hard4Dpp,4,Thu Jun 4 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"No issue here, it is just difficult to know for sure unless you give it a try. I heartily agree you can be whatever you wish to be, but how can you really tell what brand name you wish to be labeled as [knowing all that will be attributed to you whichever you chose] if you have not gone wading so to speak?  Right or wrong, people will place some level of expected behaviors or suspected activities to your life if you say...""I am bi, trans, gay, etc."" If you don't mind folks assuming whatever about you, run with it, just be prepared for that eventuality."

I like sex with both sexes, but am only interested in building relationships with women. There is nothing wrong with knowing what you want and how you operate so long as your SO/wife/husband knows the score.  Coming out to the world about who you want to spend your life with and coming out to the world about who you want to get your jollies with are two different things. One is a private matter one is a declaration of love. The latter needs to be celebrated by all that love you and wish for your eternal happiness while the prior is something you can talk to others about if you wish, but has no baring on others lives' and does not need to be their business if you have no interest in sharing that with them.  Never do I talk to my family about my sex life and rarely do I discuss it with my friends. My desire to suck a cock from time to time does not define me as a person. Who and how I love does."

I've faced a huge amount of biphobia and ignorance when I started being open about my sexuality. I got the usual shit like ""you're doing it for attention"", ""you're really just straight"", and, bizarrely ""you're really just asexual"" (I don't even know how the person came up with the last one).  There were times in the past where I thought maybe it would be easier  if I just said to everyone ""yeah, look, I made it up for attention"", and that would be it. I wouldn't have to face the shit I still face to this day.   But there's one thing that stopped me. If there's one thing I've always been, it's true to myself. I've never changed myself for anyone and never will. Why would I start now? To stay true to my values, through whatever shit I had to face, goddammit I like guys and girls and fuck you for not taking it seriously. All it means is that I now know who my true friends are.   I'm sick of the bullshit to. Having to face it day in day out is tiring. But I know what I am and that's all that matters. There's no measuring of attraction, there's no 65% gay 35% straight. I'd fuck guys. I'd also fuck girls. I find them both attractive. End of story. But you know what? I'm not going to let some ignorant dickbags ruin my life and my sexuality just because they're too uncomfortable with anything other than binary orientation (some of them aren't even comfortable with anything other than heterosexuality).   The worst thing you can do now is listen to those people. To hell with them, who are they to tell you who you are? If people act like that around you then distance yourself from them and find people who are accepting.  It might not be the easiest thing to do but it's worth it. You're you, you're amazing, and god fucking dammit you're bisexual and that's great. You have the capacity to do what so many others can't, and that's love someone regardless of their gender. So  you celebrate that part of yourself with those who accept you for who you are, not for who they want you to be.   We'll always be here for you and love you for who you are. There are enough ignorant people out there who will hate you and demean you for your sexuality. Don't do it to yourself."

bisexual,38em9q,geekguy121,2,Wed Jun 3 22:56:43 2015 UTC,To add on to the amazing things the guy before said. Just because you don't necessarily want romantic relationships with women doesn't mean you aren't bi or that it would be easier if you were gay. My boyfriend prefers relationships with guys but enjoys sex with men and women equally (his words). I identify as gay but I am not opposed to having sex with a woman but it's more of a curiosity and if the bf wants a MMF I'd be down for it.
bisexual,38em9q,epicureanmanslut,4,Thu Jun 4 08:27:51 2015 UTC,"I think there is even more pressure on Bi males.

I don't know you but I can bet there is some personality trait that you find attractive in a person that someone else might complain you ""fetishize"".

You could meet a bi couple and see them both and share feelings, etc for both. Or you could meet a person who shares your feelings and the 2 of you see other folks together or on the side, etc.  Any number of coincidences can come together if you try and stay positive and make yourself available.

I'm not going to try and convince you that being Bi is the best and you should be happy about it, because I think that is counterproductive.

I'm not sure it's healthy, but it is possible.   Okay I don't actually recommend denying the way you feel about your own sexuality. But if you feel like your life would be easier if you only had sex with guys, you could always try only sleeping with dudes for awhile and reevaluate later if it's working for you.   While there are exceptions, most bi people don't need sex with both genders to be satisfied, they are just capable of being satisfied by sex with either gender."

Some piece of your brain clearly doesn't want to... the attractions to women were clearly an important part of your teenage years and fueled your creativity for a long time. That's a difficult thing to give up even if you get no utility from it.  I know because I've had little luck with women. I am up for dating them and having romantic relations with them, but finding women willing to date me is very tough. Men are much easier. It's gotten to the point where now I'm turning down men left and right to leave myself open, and I'm putting a ton of effort into asking women out... and it's going nowhere. Maybe I'll give up on them in 4 years if this continues, idk. But for now, I consider being bisexual an important part of myself and I derive strength from it. I feel like I could shift my attractions more towards men or towards women if I wanted to, but I like it here."

She said I was just riding the coattails of Bruce Jenner. And that tipped me overboard. I yelled ""Fuck You"" at her and now I've been in my room sobbing. It makes me feel subhuman.

bisexual,38c7e2,gpot97,6,Wed Jun 3 07:33:53 2015 UTC,"College is a great opportunity to start fresh with new people who know nothing about you. If you have some social anxiety, try to challenge yourself. Put yourself in a socially uncomfortable or awkward position and work through it. Get involved in clubs on campus, take advantage of all the social opportunities that are available. I find that the best relationships begin when we aren't trying to start a relationship."
bisexual,38c7e2,gooseygander42,3,Wed Jun 3 13:03:02 2015 UTC,"It is soooo not a big deal if you never had a relationship or dated in high school.  You will probably be surprised when you do get to college this fall just how many other freshmen haven't dated either.  Just get out there, go to clubs and activities that appeal to you, chat to your hallmates, go to class, eat at the dining hall and look inviting.  You will find friends, and a relationship and dating will follow at the right time."
bisexual,38bxvg,Seekingadvise,3,Wed Jun 3 05:53:02 2015 UTC,"It's probably best if you tell her before you get married. This is the sort of thing you'd want to be open and honest about, right?"
bisexual,38bxvg,jdlashley,2,Wed Jun 3 06:01:46 2015 UTC,It is known.  She actually identifies as pansexual so I know she wouldn't care. I just don't know how to approach the situation. Like I said in the post I  am unsure I could even know for certain if I am Bi or not.
bisexual,38bxvg,whodamanny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:04:52 2015 UTC,If you are bi do you think it would change how you feel about her?
bisexual,38bxvg,whodamanny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:15:06 2015 UTC,Not at all.
bisexual,38bxvg,FancyLadyOfCornwood,3,Wed Jun 3 06:18:44 2015 UTC,"Ok cool. Personally I think if you should be open and honest like /u/jdlashley said. Since she pansexual maybe she can help you sort out how you feel about men because you can be honest with her. For example, you can talk about men you find attractive, fantasies, etc.   I think it will calm some of your anxiety over the issue with some good open communication with her. Now about your physical needs about wanting to be with another man, I think that's a whole different conversation to have with her in terms of the logistics of your relationship."
bisexual,38bxvg,FancyLadyOfCornwood,3,Wed Jun 3 06:23:31 2015 UTC,"Talk to her about it.  Especially since she's pansexual, she might understand more than you think.  I'm a bi lady and my male SO admitted to me recently that he is also attracted to guys but ""doesn't like labels"".  Want to know the first emotion I felt?  Excitement.  Because now he knows how I feel! I feel less alone and I feel I can talk more openly about who I am and be understood."
bisexual,38bxvg,ou_tis,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"First, let me thank you for response. I hadn't thought about this in the way you put it in your last sentence and it really made me want to talk to her about my possible bisexuality. Now the only problem is how to do it.  I wonder if I could ask you a few questions about your case????  How long have you two been together (if you don't mind my asking)? How did he approach the topic? I don't just want to come out of nowhere with it and would prefer it to come out in the fluidity of the conversation. Almost as if it had been mentioned before - like its no big deal ( because it really isn't). Was there talk about you helping him discover these feelings?? I don't want to give my fiancée the impression that I am bringing up my bisexuality as an excuse to have an open relationship. Lastly, what happened afterwards - any significant changes in your relationship?"
bisexual,38bxvg,ou_tis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:07:17 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I'll answer all your questions 1. Six months 2. I really don't remember how it first came up.  I don't think there's a good way to work it into conversation.  I think if you tell her ""hey, there's something I'd like to talk about, and I'm really nervous, but I want to tell you because I love you and this is important to me…"" and then go for it, that's fine.  Otherwise I might feel blindsided.  3. We had a talk about having another man join us at some point, but that's down the road.  He made it clear that any exploration of his attraction to men would be in partnership with me, and I'm okay with that.  And when you tell your fiancee, tell her ""I don't want you to think I'm bringing this up because i want an open relationship"" Again, because she's pan, I think she'll understand.  Bi/Pan people are often subjected to nasty stereotypes about how slutty we are. 4. Not really.  Some of his fantasies of men have made their way into our sexy talk, but I find it exciting and not at all weird.  I know what he wants out of any encounter with a man, what he would fine appealing about it etc.  I've been talking to friends of mine in the queer and polyamorous communities about their experiences and advice should we choose to invite another man into our sexy times, but again, it's not something either one of us is desperate to have happen RIGHT NOW."
bisexual,38bxvg,hyzenthlay1701,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"I also got engaged without ever experimenting with a guy.  I've  struggled with feeling confident in my identity, constantly questioning whether I was ""really"" bi or not, because of this.  There was a particularly hard time, when we weren't having sex for a few months, where I was, somewhat implausibly, worried that I was gay.    Being bi is hard sometimes, and the self-doubt in particular can be crippling--I found that it was affecting other parts of my life, making me less confident, more passive in my career, etc.--and you will absolutely need your partner's support and acceptance to have the kind of life you want with her.  The risk is that you'll tell her, and she'll freak out.  My fiancee is bi also, and talking about my sexuality still makes her insecure sometimes, even to the point of a panic attack.  We had a few situations like that escalate to the point of me asking for an open relationship, and her threatening to move out.    So my advice would be--if she takes it hard, don't take it personally.  Bi males get a bad rap, and there aren't a lot of us being out and monogamous, or even with women at all, frankly.  It sounds like your fiancee might take it much better than that, but you should prepare to be compassionate and patient if some anxiety/insecurity comes up."
bisexual,38bxvg,cripplesmith,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:11:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response, and I am sorry to read that you've experienced some struggles because of this. If you don't mind my asking - how did you first approach the topic with her and what was the initial reaction?"

bisexual,38bltl,ToCompletion,4,Wed Jun 3 04:04:00 2015 UTC,I am not too sure what the mechanics of your marriage are but it sounds that you guys are willing to open it so she can explore her options. I sorta went through the same thing but I was the bisexual one in the relationship and my ex. When I brought it up with her we laid out some ground rules when we opened up our relationship:  1.) I would always be honest with each other. No secrets about our relationships outside of our relationship.  2.) We would value our relationship over any other.  3.) We had a set schedule when we can date other people.  4.) Always had open communication.   This was a good starting point for us. Ultimately we didn't get married and broke up because of other issues we went through at the end. I hope this helps you out some.
bisexual,38bltl,whodamanny,2,Wed Jun 3 06:10:41 2015 UTC,I hope you are happier now with things in your life. These are similar things we have been discussing if anything were to happen. I just want to make sure I don't start a trend where she feels like she needs to ever hide anything from me. That kind of thing will not end up well in 20 years.  Thank you for your input.

bisexual,38bltl,Hard4Dpp,2,Wed Jun 3 13:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the number one thing that needs to be sorted out is what kind of acceptance and exploration she's looking for.  On the one extreme, she might want threesomes or freedom to have relationships with women, or she might still want total monogamy and all she wants is to hear that you still love her and nothing has to change.  To cut a long story very short, the only thing I really wanted to hear from my husband when I told him I was bi was that he still loved me and that it was okay.  Everything else was secondary."
bisexual,388ezh,spoomf520,47,Tue Jun 2 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"Do remember: just because you're bi doesn't mean you have to have experiences with both.  If you WANT to, that's certainly a question to explore, but you don't HAVE to.  I feel like there's often this belief that everyone who's bi should experience both genders at some point and that you're incomplete if you don't.  There's nothing wrong with being devoted to one person and not wanting to stray from that: it doesn't make you any less bi.  Everyone's wired differently: find what works for you and makes you happy."

bisexual,388ezh,GWmaleCO,3,Wed Jun 3 05:40:28 2015 UTC,"Perfectly stated. I see people as options, regardless of gender. In a monogamous relationship you limit yourself to that person. You can still find other people attractive, but don't have to act on it any more than a straight person having to sleep with every member of the opposite sex."
bisexual,388ezh,SlipspaceRupture01,16,Wed Jun 3 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"Being bi is tough. You never know which gender you like more and your preferences can always change.

bisexual,388ezh,booofedoof,4,Tue Jun 2 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"This is on point. For most of my life I felt like OP, but I preferred women. It got to the point where I wasn't attracted to men if I hadn't been with a women in a while. Now I'm more attracted to men. It changes up for people sometimes."
bisexual,388ezh,aoeui-dhtns,9,Tue Jun 2 20:47:13 2015 UTC,"Its hard to have feelings that you haven't had a chance to work through in experience. Do you want to do something about it? The usual script is to decide what you need vs. what you want, and talk to your bf about what the relationship can accommodate. If you have a need that the relationship can't accommodate then, simply, the relationship doesn't meet your needs. But that can be a lot to give up when it's so close to being the right thing."

It's natural to appreciate sexual aspects of other humans while you're in a relationship.

That said, if tits are looking good to you, you may need to do yourself a favor and tell him you need to do this for your own growth. You have to  be up front about it all, but you can't deny your need to find out who you want to be.  However, if you are deeply in love with him, discuss it with him, and he balks at the idea, you then have to decide what is more important to you. The answer may be he is what you want and exploration with women will have to wait, if the time ever presents itself."

As far as three somes go,  you said that you get jealous easy but there's always the option of him not being physically involved with her and still have fun.

bisexual,388pl5,WooglyOogly,9,Tue Jun 2 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"Go with it.  There were a few years of my life where I was watching gay porn pretty much exclusively, while only sleeping with women.  Aside from preferring one gender over the other, gay porn has a very different aesthetic than straight porn--more ""sporting"", more emphasis on respect and consent--that make it feel a lot safer, while still being sufficiently intense.  You could try to see if there is any straight porn that appeals to you in a similar way, and why.  The other thing is that the feeling like something is ""wrong"" or ""perverse"" about watching it will charge things up more--the more you accept that you enjoy it, you may find an equilibrium where you watch it less."
bisexual,388pl5,ou_tis,9,Tue Jun 2 17:44:28 2015 UTC,"Lady here. I'm not the least bit interested in dicks that aren't attached to my husband. I exclusively watch porn with only women, and I exclusively have sex with my husband. The one does not interfere with the other.   The whole point of identifying as ""bisexual"" is that it's OK to be attracted to different genders, and a monogamous relationship does not change that."

I did feel like I shouldn't watch the kind of porn that turned me on when I was younger, but later I've come to accept that there is no reason to push away what I really want. I'm glad I was able to accept this, and I hope that if it's some kind of ""guilt"" that's holding you back, you'll also be able to accept that there is no reason to feel guilt in what you want to watch."

I also was in a relationship with my best friend (still together) who is the most beautiful woman ever. But when I do watch porn, I too watch gay porn almost exclusively.  To me, it's easier for me to feel what another guy is feeling. I love watching my gf get off because I know it's genuine, but with porn I have no way to tell if the girl is faking or not. I have no gauge to tell me, ""Yes, that would be very pleasurable, she's reacting appropriately.""  I do have a dick though, so I know when a blowjob looks like a good blowjob and the guy getting it is reacting the way a real person would react. I'm more able to empathize with their pleasure because I have felt that same pleasure before.   Maybe that's what you're doing, too. Either way, to answer your title question: Yes, 100% absolutely."

The list of things people enjoy reads like a sheet of paper with check boxes next to everything.

Im not going to ask for trouble, I am not sure i would even go down there. The interracial marriage laws were all struck down just 50 years ago, who knows when that will %100 ok every where.

Edit: I used gay on purpose here. These people probably have little to no understanding of gay issues, and so, lesbian, bi, and gay people are all red flagged as 'gay'.  I live in a small city, and deal with this from time to time. It's lessening because the new generation is really fighting, so I can honestly say I've experienced both of your situations :("

I'm sorry if I can't be of help but stories like these just put me on fire anger. I'd say for you to go back in the closet, you're not going to change anyone's minds by making them pissed at you for liking the same gender. It's just a month and half, and maybe by the end of that time if you reveal that after they know you, they might change their minds."

I was hoping I could try and convince them we aren't harmful people. It may be a quixotic errand."
bisexual,3866tq,tar2594,35,Tue Jun 2 03:22:13 2015 UTC,"She does realize that two women CAN have children together, if they want them, right?    You are not required to spawn children because your mother wants you to.    You are not required to marry a man because your mother wants you to.  You are not required to sacrifice your happiness for someone else, regardless of who they are, or what they did.  You do what's right for You and no one else, and eventually your mom will either get her shit in line and realize her expectations of you are straining your relationship, or she'll continue to act like a child.  Hopefully it will be the former.  I wish you all the best in your future relationships, regardless of their gender, and that you find YOUR happiness in life.  Because that's all that Really matters."

bisexual,387a8g,Ian47,6,Tue Jun 2 10:42:30 2015 UTC,"22 male here, I've went through the same thing on many occasions. Most of my friends are people I met in my degree program in college, which was music. So a lot of us are very open-minded and artsy people, but it's still hard to come out regardless if you know that they definitely won't care.  For me, it's just that little, insecure voice in my head. The one that says, ""If you come out, you'll no longer be 'their friend Scal3s', but rather 'Their bisexual friend Scal3s who's bisexual'. Is that what you want?"". And it totally isn't, but that also is totally not the case.  What helped me was just coming out to more and more people, by different means. I wrote a letter to my aunt and uncle, who have a gay son, so I knew they'd be cool with it. But it was still too hard to actual speak the words. Then I'd just get drunk (Not necessarily recommended) and come out to more of my friends. Now if it comes up, I just don't deny it.  So basically, pick your battles, no matter how illogical it may be. I've also found coming out to girls is easier for me, for whatever reason. Just pick someone to come out to that you know won't care or make a big deal or whatever, and do it somehow. Subtle hints, a letter, a text message, whatever. The more you come out, the easier it gets."
bisexual,387a8g,Scal3s,2,Tue Jun 2 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. Its good to know this happens to other people. Also, ive found its easier with girls too for whatever reason"
bisexual,387a8g,aoeui-dhtns,5,Tue Jun 2 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"Try this:   ""I need to tell you something."" (Tell them)   The first sentence is easier to say, gets your audience to listen, and puts you on the hook to actually tell them.   Also: nothing is wrong with you <3"
bisexual,387a8g,AskRedditor69,3,Tue Jun 2 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't come out to anyone until college. During our pledging process for my fraternity, we were given an opportunity 1 on 1 to say whatever is on our mind (leading up to it, its basically a trial of this is a safe place to be who you want to be). I had the thought to just say ""I'm bi!"" It was on the tip of my tongue, I could feel it, picture myself saying those words, but instead I just collapsed and cried.  A few months and a couple drinks later I finally told a small group of friends, then I told all 40 of my fraternity brothers. It was liberating, but finally my time to say it and I was met with open arms and smiles as I cried on the floor again....  The point is, do it when you're ready and don't be afraid of your close friends. :)  Good luck"
bisexual,387a8g,Definetelynottom,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I know how difficult it is. I'm still there myself, though maybe a little further back. Before I ended up going out with a guy for about a month I think pretty much everyone suspected I was a lesbian since I'd never seemed interested in anyone to them, and my dad at least made it clear he was okay with people being gay one time when I was extremely anxious about something and I guess he thought that might have been the issue (also, bless my dad because he is amazing). I guess I've put it off for quite a few years, telling myself all kinds of reasons. I've even got the friends to boot (A gay guy and an asexual girl for two of such people - I met up with them before leaving college for the summer and practically felt like I was pretending to be the token straight girl - they cracked a gaydar joke and I wanted to join in but mentally blocked off). I guess what it comes down to is whether you feel ultimately comfortable and safe to talk to someone about it. I've heard it can be pretty relieving to get it out there and you mention that you have people who could possibly support you, so maybe if you feel you are safe you could talk to your friend about it (easier said than done, I know). Maybe writing it on paper would help? (I'm sorry about not being too good at this. I'm somewhere behind you here if that makes sense, though batting around an extra idea in any problem is something I've found useful sometimes)"
bisexual,386fow,fixationed,24,Tue Jun 2 04:38:10 2015 UTC,"The fact that he told you of his own violition counts for a lot. If he just lied and lied until you somehow found out thats one thing, but admitting to a Really Bad Mistake when it might cost you everything and you lose nothing by staying silent takes SERIOUS courage and responsibility, even if it took him a while to work it through his system. So, he gets points for that. Is it enough? Well...  This is your life and your relationship OP. Not about our opinions, its about what life you want. For right now take some time. Take a week in a secure place so you can be calm and think things through at leisure. Talk to him or not but dont make final decisions until you feel you are making the truest one.  Right now some of the questions you need to ask yourself are   Do you want to keep the relationship? In 20 years looking back how would you want it to go? What needs to happen in order for you to trust him again? Setting ground rules so he can experiment if he talks to you first? Free reign? No extra touch at all ever? Can he hold to that? Can you trust him if he agrees? Was he safe, has he been tested, have you been tested? Go get tested."
bisexual,386fow,CourageousWren,20,Tue Jun 2 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"It seems a lot of people here are excusing his cheating because he ""needed"" to explore his sexuality. Yeah, no, fuck that. Him wanting to explore is completely seperate from his actions. He cheated on you. He put having a random blowjob over your 8 month relationship. Just think about that. It shows how little he truly cares about your relationship.   Oh and don't give him extra points for fessing up. Since it's so short of a relationship I'd just ditch him but if you want to attempt to work it out there's going to have to be a lot of effort from both of you."
bisexual,386fow,catnipcatnip,9,Tue Jun 2 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"He knew you're bi but didn't think he could talk to you about it? Way off base, to begin with. And then he cheated! Forget him."
bisexual,386fow,aoeui-dhtns,6,Tue Jun 2 05:55:08 2015 UTC,haha i told him im bisexual at the beginning of our relationship and he was great about it and mentioned he might be bi but had never really thought about it. since then he has said he's become more comfortable accepting that he thinks he really is and i didn't think anything of it. just something that lets us discuss how hot guys/girls are on tv and whatnot. we've talked about me doing things with girls and i said i didn't know if i was comfortable with him doing stuff with guys. (im not a hypocrite because i never actually did and on the rare occasion i wanted to make out with someone i'd ask him and he even encouraged it)
bisexual,386fow,aoeui-dhtns,16,Tue Jun 2 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"But after all that he couldn't just check with you first? The terms of your relationship were clear, and he broke them. I just don't get it."
bisexual,386fow,alternativeleanings,0,Tue Jun 2 06:26:31 2015 UTC,"I think its a bit more complicated than that... Also if he feels he needs to explore his sexuality (and being told to hold it in, from personal experience, isn't a good feeling) it would be better to talk honestly about how he feels and yes, make it clear that what he did wasn't OK or within the terms of the relationship."
bisexual,386fow,catnipcatnip,12,Tue Jun 2 11:34:12 2015 UTC,If his need to explore his sexuality is so bad he should've asked his partner before letting some guy suck his dick or he should've just left the relationship.
bisexual,386fow,aoeui-dhtns,4,Tue Jun 2 12:30:40 2015 UTC,I must agree. A guy who is so confused about himself to not abide by relationship agreements isn't ready for a relationship at all.
bisexual,386fow,Ulfric_Stormtoke,6,Tue Jun 2 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"If he needed to explore his sexuality, he should have asked his monogamous partner if she was OK with him doing that before just going out and cheating on her. The terms of their relationship were clear and he violated them.  ""Exploring my sexuality"" might be a reason people cheat, but it damn well isn't an excuse."

bisexual,386fow,PoseidonOfTheSea,2,Tue Jun 2 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think that you shouldn't drop the relationship. Obviously it's not great that he cheated on you to explore his sexuality, but as you said he feels really guilty about it, & doesn't like how he's hurt your feelings, so he must really care about you.  You should talk to him about this, about why he wasn't more open with you than he could've been. At the very least, don't simply drop this relationship so suddenly. Give some time to think about it more clearly."

bisexual,386fow,jeffumm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"If you love him, and are certain he loves you, then don't make any quick decisions.    Clearly your trust is shaken, and he knew it would be...but he would rather that you heard it directly from him, and not find out another way, and so even though it took a while for him to work up his courage, he DID tell you and come clean with you. He clearly wants a chance to win your trust back.    He made a mistake. He blew it (or rather, he was blown :-] ). Keep in mind that the guy has probably been tortured for all those weeks, and if you don't think that he has then maybe he's not a keeper...but if he was, then maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive him.    If it's okay, let me tell you about my situation, with my wife. I'm straight, she's bi. We also have a single son, who is also bi.    We've been married long enough that our son (conceived a year after) is in high school. My wife didn't realize she was bi until after we were married (she would tell you I realized it about her first!), and she's never EVER had sex with a girl. She feels unfulfilled in this area, and I totally get that.    I've told her a long time ago that I trust her enough to go ""have fun"" with a girl, as long as there's no emotional attachment formed and no penis involved (since I can provide both of those), and that I know she'll come home to me and we'll be fine. She also knows I'll have SOME jealous feelings (and that if she wants I can be there to watch but that it's totally not necessary as far as I'm concerned).    She's made out with girls at parties, and I've taken her on trips to towns/counties with strip clubs and bought her lap dances (and the dancers were VERY generous with my wife, saying they loved her big natural boobs). But my wife's never made it to actual lady sex so far. And she's kind-of getting frustrated about that!    Seeing the difficulty my wife has had to find the chance to fulfill the opposite side (same-gender side) of her bisexual coin, even with support from me, then I can see how and why your boyfriend might have jumped on a (possibly rare) opportunity to see what's up with the whole guy-guy thing. Especially if you were out of town at the time.    In his shoes I might have called you first. Yeah, it would be a totally awkward conversation with you. Yeah, it might ruin the opportunity (because the other dude isn't going to wait to blow your BF while he calls his GF to get the green light!). But yeah, he should have preserved your trust in him first and foremost. Cheating is cheating.    IF you two bi folk (I think we can now agree he's bi, right?) DO in fact stay together, then you need to communicate and work out what same-sex arrangements are cool with the other. It needs to be fair and equal and preserving of trust. Because if you can't trust each other, then there's really no relationship.    EDIT: a word"

I'm giving this radio station the benefit of a doubt. I am super careful in using people's preferred pronouns but I've caught myself saying him and Bruce while talking to my boyfriend. I know that my lapses in memory are caused by her coming out interview with Diane Sawyer where she said to keep using Bruce and male pronouns so I'm still in the phase where I have to catch myself.

bisexual,383ssg,travelbug888,6,Mon Jun 1 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"For me, my girlfriend was a perfect fit so being with her was really easy. Telling everyone about being Bi was really easy because my feelings about her were really obvious to me. It surprised me that she felt insecure about me not actually being into girls or just experimenting. She told me she was totally okay with me experimenting but I was so surprised when she said that because I liked her and that was that. It surprised her because how comfortable I was with being Bi and being open to my friends about it.   I can totally relate to it being thrilling, sexy, and scary because I totally surprised myself on how much I was into this girl. I'm 21 and I have been in long term relationships back to back for 7 years up until the beginning of this year. I was bicurious/unsure since I was 13 because I was always in committed relationships with men and I didn't have the chance to really explore that side of myself. I met my girlfriend last October and we were drawn to each other like magnets. It blew my mind on how well we got along because I'm mostly friends with dudes, not girls. I was pretty stoked and we quickly became best friends. I was still ""straight"" at the time but I remember when I first found out she was gay and I immediately thought ""I'd totally hook up with her"". It wasn't the first time I thought about girls in that way at that point, but it still blew my mind. After hanging out once, we saw each other every weekend, and then later on almost every day. She's my other half. I love her so much haha.   I totally understand about being afraid about cultural issues. I'm asian too. I've always known that I'd be serious about this girl since we first started hanging out. I knew I could never deny I liked her so to me, there is a serious possibility about having a talk with my parents about her and about me liking girls. It's interesting because my girlfriend doesn't quite see it that way because she's a lesbian so she will be having that talk 100% and for me, she thinks that I probably will be fine and I don't have to worry because I still have a ""chance"" at normalcy. It's just different perspectives haha. Up until a few months ago I did not even consider what it would be like to marry a girl. How are my relatives going to react and are they even going to come to my wedding? I honestly have NO idea. All I know is that I'm happy and that is what's most important to me.   TL;DR - What made this whole amazing roller coaster ride better was  that I committed to being honest with myself 100%."
bisexual,383ssg,artemiswally,3,Mon Jun 1 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"I rarely comment here but I lurk a lot. I'm not currently in an LTR, but I am a lesbian who has been in relationships with bisexual women before. The most important thing is honesty. It sounds like you guys might be at different places in life (your lack of experience being in same sex relationships vs. here being out and proud for a really long time).  For one thing, same-sex couples have families all the time. Sure, you might need some outside help, but it is done all the time. I get it about being from a conservative family, but this is your life to lead, not theirs, and you should live it for yourself.   My bottom line is that the best thing you can do is be honest with all parties involved, including yourself. If, for whatever reason, you know deep down that you have no intention of coming out of the closet and entering a real LTR with this openly lesbian woman, you need to be honest with yourself, and with her, about it, so that she can find someone who is looking for the same things she is looking for.  I'm glad you want to be respectful and responsible with everyone. That's the first big step. Many ""curious"" or ""barsexual"" women pose as bisexual and use lesbians and actual bisexual women as ways to experiment, and that isn't cool. They have no intention of being in an LTR same-sex union. I've had this happen before, and it burns, hard, so, I am glad you're trying to do the right thing by everyone.  I know this wasn't a story LOL, but I just felt compelled to answer, and I hope a bit of clarity from a stranger on the internet helps. Good luck."
bisexual,383ssg,proudgqdyke,2,Tue Jun 2 10:47:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm late to the party, but I have relevant experience. I assumed I was straight for the first 28 years of my life. I'd always been pretty open minded about sexuality and gender, but I'd never really met a woman I was attracted to aside from ""girl crushes "" on celebrities.  Then I became good friends with a lesbian woman I worked with. After some time I found myself thinking about her in the same way I would a man I was attracted to. For me it was really natural to feel this way, because we shared so much in common. It didn't matter that I was falling in love with a woman, but that I was falling in love with my soul mate.   Anyway, after some initial hesitation due to not wanting to risk our friendship, we started a relationship. And never looked back.  I'm happier and more comfortable with her than I ever have been in a relationship. We have helped each other through so much and we are getting married this October after 2 1/2 years.   I'm lucky to be old enough to be independent and comfortable enough with myself that coming out wasn't a big deal. My friends were all super cool with it and love my partner. Both of our families are just glad that we've found someone to make us happy. Our relationship has even helped mend some distance  in her family since she had come out years ago.   Anyway, that's our story, for what it's worth. Bit women in happy same Sex ltrs do exist. I hope this helps in anyway.  Good luck with your situation."

bisexual,384qq6,PastForward,3,Mon Jun 1 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"I know you aren't looking to get a label, but here it is anyway lol:  Well, I'm no authority on the matter, I don't know if you can be considered bi if you're not confortable with the same sex sexually.  When someone likes a gender sexually but not romantically it's usually considered bi, as they would still have homossexual sex, which definitely doesn't fall into straight cathegory.   On your specific case you show yourself as bisexual romantically, but straight sexually, there's more to each of these cathegories than a yes or no question, but it seems to me that to you it's a yes for romantically, and no sexually.  Obviously you haven't met a bisexual that doesn't like dick because people in the same situation as you might not be vocal about their homossexual side, and keep it straight also they might not consider themselves bisexual."

You're not the only one out there with confusing things going on. Try not to let the guilt take over as it tends to mess with your brain very easily. It usually helps me when I go out to announce it to whoever I've keyed in on that I won't/can't/don't feel comfortable going below the belt and it usually helps diffuse some of the tension. The biggest thing to remember is that you are who you are not what stereotypes or what anyone else wants you to be. Don't ever guilt yourself into doing something that you are truly not comfortable with.

I just like men in general. And women. And everyone. As long as my partners understand that I'm a bottom in every conceivable way and then some, partners of all genders and sexes are encouraged. :D"

Your boyfriend is right! There's something reaaally hot about the middle finger you give to gender norms that way. I love when I meet a guy who likes glitter and nailpolish and topping. Probably my favourite combination in the world.  Haha, androgynous angel, that's new! <3 I have tried to just own that fact, I know there are people who enjoy trans guys, but it's nice to hear spontaneously sometimes where people profess their attraction to trans guys."

Oh I love trans guys haha, and judging from the (Admittedly few) trans guys I know irl, you guys seem to be able to pull off the androgynous look that I really really want with basically no effort and it makes me incredibly jealous!"

All I ask is that my partner let me play around back there with my tongue or some fingers! :P  I can see where crossdressing would make you feel that way! :D It's very fascinating to me.  <3 Yes, always glad to hear from people who like trans guys! It's really strange, trans guys tend to go from androgynous in early transition to ""holy shit suddenly you look like a 100% burly dude"", I have no idea what happens.

There are a lot of stereotypes about bi people and cheating, plus there's the idea that bi people just haven't picked a side, so if a bi girl and a lesbian break up and the bi girl ends up dating a guy after, the lesbian often feels like it was just an experimentation phase or something.

One of the most common, ( and least disheartening / rude.) Is that to put it simply, They won't be enough for you. Members of their gender, will not be enough for you, and you would not be truly happy unless you could get what you want / need. ( this is said with the idea that you will cheat in mind, not anyone making a dig at those who happen to be polyamorous.) Talk to your girlfriend about that kind of thing. Get it open between the both of you, what her worries are, and do your best to dissuade and assuage them. Tell her she's more than enough for you if she is.

The only true way is to let her know that you're not going to leave her for a man because she doesn't have 'the goods' he has. Lesbians dating bi girls can be insecure that they'll leave them to start a family with a man when they get tired of playing with the lesbian.    I'm a guy and my ex-gf was insecure I'd leave her for a man. No matter how much I assured her that I wouldn't, and that if I were to leave her it would be because of us and her (not for someone else) she was still insecure and had that nagging thought at the back of her head.

bisexual,382rck,glitterhooter,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:45:21 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I've been bi-curious since I was about 13 years old. I'm a young woman, and I'm in a long term relationship with a man (the only relationship I've ever had).  Despite the fact that I am pretty sure I'm bi-sexual, I think I would feel uncomfortable if my boyfriend told me he was bi-sexual. I know that doesn't make sense - how could I judge him for being the same orientation as me? But honestly, I think I would feel insecure too.  I don't think that bi-sexuals are trashy or more provocative or any of the other stereotypes - that's silly to me. However, I think I would feel jealous if he was bi-sexual. I know he must see some girls and think 'she's cute.' So if he were bi-sexual, I feel he'd have those thoughts twice as often. Also, I would be afraid that he wasn't satisfied with me, that sometimes he may want someone the opposite sex instead.  I think that because sometimes I wish I could be with girls. I love him deeply and we are best friends - but he is my first relationship and I have never had the opportunity to explore the other side of me. Sometimes, I day dream about girls. So if I found out he was bi sexual, I'd be afraid he wasn't completely fulfilled because sometimes, I don't feel like I am.   This is the first time I've written how I feel/admitted that I think I'm bisexual. It's scary. A little exhilarating. Weird. I feel guilty writing it because my boyfriend doesn't know this about me at all. But I wanted to share my two cents on this topic.  My advice would be to be open, honest, and up front with her (which is ironic because of my own circumstance - I know. But if I'm not 100% sure of my orentiation, I don't want to tell him because it's hard to explain to myself, let alone someone else). But I do feel being honest and telling her how you feel would be best for you. After you talk it out, if she is still uncomfortable, it's out of your hands. She has to make the decision to be okay with it or not.   Good luck and best wishes."
bisexual,382rck,glitterhooter,3,Thu Jun 4 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"I hope the following will help you or anyone get over the insecurity you're feeling:  You know what it truly comes down to? IMHO, it's ethics and morals. Are you an ethical person? Do you keep your word? If you knowingly entered a monogamous relationship, would you cheat?  And flip these questions around for anyone you're in a relationship with, no matter their orientation. Cheating is cheating. So what if the pool of dating possibilities has doubled. ETHICS, dude.  Honestly, I've been a happy wife for 15-years and desiring the other sex doesn't go away. EVER. But I have mad respect and deep love for my husband. I know I'll never be able to be with a woman romantically or sexually again. I accepted that when I entered the relationship.  If the dynamics of our relationship changes, then great. If not, I'll be with others only if we're not together.  We communicate. He accepts, loves, and respects me as well. I can share my thoughts on both sexes. We point out attractive women to each other. He watches lesbian porn with me. He shares my bisexuality with me. We allow it to be open and not shameful.  It's all about communication, love, honesty with the spouse and yourself, and respect.  ETA: Fixed grammar."
bisexual,382rck,glitterhooter,2,Thu Jun 4 04:33:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't cheated on him nor do I plan to. I am 100% against being unfaithful and would never do that.  Just because I haven't shared my personal feelings about something doesn't mean I'm being dishonest. I just want to be sure that I really feel that way before I tell anyone else.  I just wanted to share my thoughts, I didn't say that they were rational, just possibilities for what the OP's girlfriend may feel.

bisexual,3811d6,theladyjinx,10,Mon Jun 1 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm in pretty much the same boat, though I've only been with two women ever. I'm definitely, no question about it, vastly more attracted to women. As a result, I am more likely to feel comfortable with men than women in groups or social settings. But i way prefer sex and relationships with men. I don't know why, really. When I first came out as bisexual (when I was 14) i always thought I'd end up with a woman.   Part of it for me might just be feelings of inadequacy, too. I'm heavier than I want to be, and my breasts sag from nursing, and I just don't feel sexy. So while I'm ok with men seeing me naked, I'm less comfortable with women (in a sexual context).   Sometimes I wonder what I'm missing. Sometimes I sit up at night imagining life with a woman and questioning everything. But for now, I'm in love with someone who happens to be male, and I'm happy with him, so it's all just speculation."
bisexual,3811d6,dallasdarling,6,Mon Jun 1 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"Some bisexuals are more attracted to one sex physically, and the other romantically. I myself (dude) happen to be attracted to women a bit more physically, but I don't think I have a preference romantically. And some dudes I find more physically attractive than some women, it's all relative. I've never had sex before, or been in a relationship, so I am afraid I do not really have any experience here."

bisexual,3811d6,DitaVonCleese,4,Mon Jun 1 11:24:01 2015 UTC,"24 year old female here. I work in a male dominated field and I have a common law boyfriend. I find women much more attractive to look at than men. If I am watching porn, I tend to only watch females.  I have never slept with a woman, but when I picture falling in love with and sleeping with a woman I also feel saddened that we wouldn't be able to have babies together, which I feel is an important step for my life with a partner.   I think men and women have fundamental differences that can compliment each other (given the right two people) but I also believe that homosexual couples may be in a better position to understand their partners simply due to sharing the same gender issues (ie sudden, unexplained emotions, a desire to feel sexy, etc).  I have had significantly more crushes on men than women because I think I am romantically attracted to a specific type of woman whereas I am readily romantically attracted to all sorts of men.  Why do you prefer sex with men? Would you be more satisfied in homosexual sex if there was a strap-on involved? Do you think it has to do with the lack of potential to have babies too?"
bisexual,3811d6,Fisheye90,2,Mon Jun 1 04:20:37 2015 UTC,"I think I am romantically attracted to a specific type of woman whereas I am readily romantically attracted to all sorts of men.   Yes. I feel the exact same way with this. I'm very particular about what females I feel an attraction to but I feel attraction to many more males. I'm glad I'm not alone in that. I'm also in a common law relationship with a man. May I ask, does he know that you are bisexual? I'm considering telling my boyfriend but feel scared."
bisexual,3811d6,Fisheye90,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"I think he knew I was bisexual before I did. Sometimes I would absentmindedly check out a waitress' bum or other select parts and he would jokingly say something like ""Oh, come on. Get a rooooom"". He knows that I like to look at other girls and that I can find them enviously attractive, but I don't think we've specifically labelled me as bisexual.    Depending on who your significant other is, telling him you're bisexual or that you might be also interested in women may open your relationship up to all sorts of fun and new sexual experiences. In my experience, heterosexual men are pretty into the idea of having a threesome with two women, but not a woman and a man.  Why do you think you are scared about telling him? How do you think he'd react?"
bisexual,3811d6,Fisheye90,2,Wed Jun 3 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your honesty, I really appreciate your comments.  I have an open, honest relationship with my boyfriend. We've been together for four years and I trust him and love him, and he's always supported me.  I think I'm scared because I haven't truly accepted it as part of myself yet. I'm sexually attracted to females but keep saying to myself, 'you're not bi-sexual - you don't think about being with women often enough' or I make excuses for why I'm not. I don't have anything against being gay or bisexual whatsoever, but I'm struggling with feelings of shame and guilt over thinking that I might be bi-sexual, and I don't know why.  I don't know how he would feel about it, either. I asked him once how he'd feel if I was (and quickly added 'I'm not but what if) he said it would take a lot of adjusting to it and would take some time for him to accept. I'm afraid telling him because I don't want it to be weird or change our relationship.  Also, I would never have a threesome with him because I'd be too jealous and uncomfortable. So far, I haven't had a reason to express these feelings to him so I haven't."
bisexual,3811d6,Fisheye90,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear you appreciate the comments :) I am happy to provide any insight you're looking for.  When you say ""you're not bi-sexual - you don't think about being with women often enough"" you should keep in mind that sexuality is a spectrum. You don't have to like men and women equally to be bisexual. I don't think you should be feeling shame or guilt over being attracted to the same gender. What matters is that you and your man have an agreement that works for the two of you within your relationship. Is it possible that your guilty/shameful feelings are actually an uneasy feeling? And do you think that you're feeling uneasy because you haven't had as much experience with women and you're wondering if you're missing out?  Why do you think he would find it difficult to accept if you told him you were bisexual? If you still love him and care for him and respect the boundaries that you two have agreed upon, why should it matter that you also like some women?  Not wanting a threesome sounds reasonable and is certainly valid. All relationships have different boundaries and levels of comfort/openness."

Take it from this 33 year old dork who is here after waking up to 'aw, crap, #stillbisexual, shouldn't I be processing this better by now?' - it simplifies it, and comes from a healthier place, to look at it as part of accepting who you are.

Being bisexual it can be easy to say we are 'repulsed' by one gender when in reality it may be the attitude of the person we are with. I have serious issues with women at this point (I'm a woman) too many women playing at being bisexual because it might be fun. Approaching it more like it's icky and something that has to happen so they can push themselves. I've also found women lesbians to be far harder on bisexual women versus gay or straight men. I don't know, after years of negative issues with other women I've come to see myself as almost straight and it really is based in attitude versus the actual sex of the person. You give me a woman with the right attitude, who is honest, up front and genuine and I am all about them. You're man child comment speaks very loudly for why you are now finding men repulsive."

I go through phases like that (though not to the point of total repulsion), and my LTR partner knows about it because we talk it out.   If you truly want to ""deal with this"" then perhaps you need to work on your communication skills and evaluate why you can't be open and honest with the person you should trust. I hate to just throw around ""therapy"" but it really helped me get to the bottom of my feelings when I was in a weed head space, and I didn't have to worry about insulting my SO in the process."

If you can't talk with your partner on how to work around the fluidity of your sexual desire, how long do you expect this relationship to last? Have you tried talking with him? Some less than mature individuals can become surprisingly attentive when getting laid is on the line.   And if he won't discuss this with you, your options are to either lay there and think of baseball when you're having sex, abstain from sex during periods of disinterest, or break up with him."

You said adult conversations aren't possible. This is because you're not allowing them.  You called him by a sexist slur which implies bigotry on your part.  You will find the problem in the mirror.
bisexual,3814t7,WoollyHats,10,Mon Jun 1 02:17:55 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/Mattlemore24 is saying, I'd also add that many bisexual people do actually see quite a bit of discrimination from both straight and gay people (for straight people, we're ""too gay"", and for gay people, we're ""too straight""), so it could also be that he was worried you might fall into that as well.  In my experience about 30% of gay guys I've met have been anti-bisexual, and 70% have been OK with bisexual guys. That 30% stings quite a bit though, so I could see how he'd be very worried about it if his experience matches up.  Reassuring him and reinforcing that you're OK with his bisexuality (and actually think it's a positive thing!) would definitely help if this is the case."
bisexual,3814t7,Steve_the_Scout,9,Mon Jun 1 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"As a few others are saying, I'm guessing he cried because, more or less, so few people outside the bisexual crowd actually acknowledge that we exist. Relationships can and do (sometimes) end when such revelations are made. I'm guessing it wasn't so much his bisexuality that worried him as much as it was fear that the relationship would end when you found out, then overwhelming relief when it didn't. Just keep doing like you have done - tell him that he already knew you aren't like someone else he might've had a bad experience with, that you genuinely don't see this as a big deal outside his feelings on the matter (which you do obviously think is a big deal), and just listen if he talks about why he reacted the way he did. In fact, urge the bit about why he reacted that way - he probably does have severe rejection issues that he should talk through."

Mattlemore24 might be right, some bisexuals might feel like their betraying their partner just for thinking sexually of another gender than them. Or even further, they might just not think it's possible to be monogamous. You need to talk to him about it, no conversation, nothing gets done."

It may not always be at the front of every romantic encounter but you will always be second guessing your Biness, since hell most American believe bisexuality is code for confusion. Your partner loves you, but make an effort, I still have friends say I'm mostly straight or gay depending on my current partner's genitals. People like boxes and it's painful to them when someone see a nonconformist to their preconceived boxes. It's just a lot harder to be outside of the boxes"

It has worked so far! We've been together 5 years in July and I've been with maybe three girls in that time period. I've also told him he's welcome to do the same thing, but he hasn't taken me up on it.   The key to this is honesty! I think we are a pretty progressive couple, and to me, sex doesn't equate to love, sex is sex - unless of course you're having sex with someone you love. Go with your heart on this one.

It doesn't matter if you're bisexual, if you sleep with another person, you're cheating on that person.   Also, how do you know that she won't develop feelings for this other person she is sleeping with? If you're ok with a polygamous relationship, then this might not be a problem to you. Talk it out with her and ask her how it would affect your relationship with her.   PS: I love your username!"

There's little or nothing that cuts through the confusion quite like finding out for yourself what works for you and what doesn't work for you.   Furthermore, I actually have been in a similar situation. My first year of college I entered into a budding relationship with a guy a couple years older than me (I am also a guy), and although he was really nice and I found him physically attractive, the biggest takeaway from my experience with him was that I simply find it extremely difficult to form emotional and romantic relationships with other guys, whereas I already knew from experience that I was very much capable of being romantically/sexually involved with women. I felt that I had lead him on, but I ended the relationship because the feelings just weren't reciprocated. It felt forced from the beginning, in hindsight, and that's sort of how I've always felt when it comes to emotional attractions to men for me. It just doesn't do it.   Was it troubling for me to hurt someone like that? Yes. Do I regret it? Not at all. I know myself better because of that experience."

If you are both honest, open and accepting of each other it will always be possible to go back to being friends if you realize that it doesn't work out. This idea that dating always ruins friendships is complete bogus.   As for the sexual insecurity, read up on /r/sex there is a huge library devoted to educating people on what to do before/during/after sex.   Also worth noting, you don't have to have sex. If you do not feel ready for it then there is no need to rush it, because sex when you are not mentally mature for it is awful."

I don't see this as a bad thing."
bisexual,37zlcm,catnipcatnip,2,Sun May 31 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"bi means you can hold some sort of attraction, either sexual or romantically, to both sexes.    to me this is what 'umbrella' stands for - personally I do hold some attraction to the opposite sex, but not enough to actually fit into the box 'compatible with both'- as I am not.   The 'compatible with both' is the general reading- and I think it is a bad thing that those two readings have the same word-it is confusing."
bisexual,37zlcm,Internetimal,1 point,Sun May 31 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Well, these days there are terms like homoflexible/heteroflexible to try to express a preference.  But if you're not feeling terribly flexible (compatible?) I can see how that might itch.  The way I look at it is - if the right person comes along, is gender a dealbreaker?  For the truly monosexual apparently it would be.  It's possible to be straight and ultra-selective or gay and ultra-selective, and it's also possible to be bi but ultra-selective (to the point that things feel incompatible, unless 'insert seemingly implausible condition here').  But labels are also a way to communicate what we're looking for, so - I don't know, does ""bi, but I might as well be gay"" work for you?  That's where I felt I was at for a long time until I realized I was looking for compatibility and not specifically dick, and that my personal spread had ended up more even (or less utterly single-sided) than I'd thought because of that.  Hope that's not preachy, I'm trying to share a perspective, not make a prescription."
bisexual,37zlcm,djb_thirteen,8,Mon Jun 1 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"There are all sort of ambiguities in other terms for sexual orientation. Really, 'homosexual' is also used an umbrella term which covers things like asexual homoromantic, aromantic homosexual, 'vanilla homosexual', homoromantic bisexual, biromantic homosexual, trans attracted homosexual, trans unattracted homosexual, and in some cases, bisexual. The same is true of the term 'heterosexual'.  The equivalent of biphobia - erasure and denial - doesn't occur to heterosexuals and homosexuals. The languague isn't the issue: biphobic tosspots are the issue.  Most people who identify as bisexual identify both with the umbrella term and the sexual orientation. I can't think of a single famous person who identifies with the umbrella term, but not the sexual orientation.  I'm sorry you feel self-directed biphobia, and that must really suck. However, I think what's going on with you is a thing that just affects you. It's not an explanation for biphobia is wider society. All I can say is that you should identify in ways that make you happy, and if an identification as a bisexual isn't helpful to you, don't do that. We won't begrudge you the label, whatever you decide :)."

He seems to have calmed down and matured a bit, but he still flirts with his frontman a lot.

bisexual,37zlcm,cbrachyrhynchos,3,Thu Jun 4 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's the other way around actually.

bisexual,37zlcm,qqquigley,2,Sun May 31 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"Those are some great thoughts and an interesting situation you have there. I recognize that romantic and sexual attraction are different things, however, I do think that most people (including most LGBT people and most bisexuals, even) only care about who you prefer to date. So you saying that you are ""bisexual"", while only being interesting in dating one gender, is odd sounding even to me, a bisexual guy.   I don't have much of a problem with the reality I just described, because in my experience anyone willing to take part in a conversation about sexual orientation and willing to hear me when I say I'm bisexual (whether they really believe it or not) also tends to acknowledge that sexual orientation is a spectrum. The Kinsey scale is usually part of those conversations. Thus, a Kinsey 5 would be used as a shorthand for your situation. I don't think that's biphobia - I think that if you can reframe it in terms of a spectrum like the Kinsey scale, and place yourself near one end, then people will get the point that you're not ""exactly half and half"". What I think you want (correct me if I'm wrong) is for people to understand the fluidity of your sexual orientation, without expecting you to really want to date the other gender. In my experience, identifying as a Kinsey 1 or a Kinsey 5 gets that point across."
bisexual,37zlcm,PoseidonOfTheSea,2,Mon Jun 1 06:51:19 2015 UTC,"I've actually heard ""queer"" as the umbrella term for not-straight-or-gay. Never heard bisexual used for this purpose.

First of all, enjoying your short hair and looking androgynous does not mean you are trans. If so, my soft butch lesbian girlfriend should have started HRT forever ago. She dresses almost entirely in dude clothes and gets gendered male sometimes and it doesn't bother her either. She enjoys messing with people.   I would begin to worry about medical transition if you began to hate your physical feminine features/ loved only your masculine features to a point where it's causing you to be depressed. This may or may not include things like: hating your breasts, feeling like you should have a penis, having deeply unsettling feelings about your period, disliking your wide hips, wanting to be seen as male, or wishing you had facial hair. Those are just a few examples.   I'm a big fan of therapy for everyone. It helps with everything. Ask your parents if you can go to a therapist who is lgbt friendly to talk about these feelings. You can also use that time to talk about general life issues, which you're probably going to have in middle school.   From what you've described it sounds like you're a young bi girl who doesn't care about gender norms and is slightly genderfluid. Trust your feelings about yourself, try to ignore people who want to tell you who/what you are,  and keep being awesome :)"

I dunno, two cents.  As for drawing dicks everywhere, it's because penises are an inappropriate object that are easily recognisable, because they're basically sticks with a blob at the end.

These are the kinds of guys I'm talking about.  Second, when I say ""I just like pussy"", I wasn't talking about just women, we could be talking about homoromantic bisexual men saying this as well. Men could be the ones saying ""Well, I just like pussy"".  Regardless, I do think there doesn't seem to be nearly as much love (or any, really) for pussy as dick if we're talking purely a ""floating, detached anatomical trait"" here.

In my opinion, it doesn't sound rational when guys say that because either way they are sexually attracted to another man, no matter if the attraction is only to the penis; the penis is attached to the guy."

bisexual,37xeze,Kolyarut5,3,Sun May 31 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I fall into that cathegory and I don't entirely agree with you.  1: I never tried to remove myself from a label of bisexuality, before I found my affection for penis, I wanted to be a bisexual, as it seemed like it'd have more options. I'm not that fond of my own penis, despite the very penis centric society. I would actually rather be female.  2: I was never told from birth the penis is amazing, I guess you're right that society likes dicks alot, the jokes, the drawings everywhere. But I don't think it's related to that. I've always heard dick jokes, and my dick love is relatively recent.  I don't know if there is no vagina version of the penis love, I've never heard it, but most straight girls I know do say that they find women's bodies attractive, meaning, even if they like vagina, there's less chance of them focusing on the genitalia.  With men, straight guys don't find men's bodies sexually attractive, so when a straight guy suddenly loves the penis they'll focus on it.  I might be talking gibberish, but we should all take all our theories with a pinch of salt."
bisexual,37xeze,kamatsu,1 point,Sun May 31 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"It's fine to experience your bisexuality differently, however I don't think that takes away from the validity of my post. I can give you a laundry list of reddit links from my time in /r/bisexual and in /r/sex that show this phenomena in action. You wanting the label of bisexual puts you in a very small minority. I think most guys (and women as well) are pretty terrified at first of being something besides ""normal"", and often try and suppress their feelings of bisexuality.  Your gender identity is separate from your sexual identity though. You wanting to be female (while a totally legitimate feeling and it's up to you how far that desire extends) has nothing to do with why you're sexually attracted to both sexes.  Two, I think you're discounting the subtle influence society has on you. While you may have discovered your love of dick relatively recently in terms of how it relates to you sexually, you really don't think it would be any different if you had society telling you that dicks were slimy, smelled outrageously bad, etc? Society has a very positive spin on dicks, while it has a very negative spin on vaginas, and it's entirely psychological. It's bad enough that it's an issue in straight relationships, and anything about the vagina is shrouded in mystery and fear for those who have not been acquainted with it.  But is that guy really straight if he's suddenly focusing on the penis and finds he adores playing around with dick when attached to other dudes, and wants to continue to do it? I'd tend to lean towards that person being bisexual but compartmentalizing, and I notice a heavy emphasis on either ""straight"" or ""heteroflexible"" labels with these guys, it's obvious they sense the privilege of identifying as ""normal"" in society and aren't quite ready to give up that label. A lot of my bisexual male friends went through a phase like this, even though not all of them were focused entirely on the penis, it was more of a game of ""naw I can just tell when a handsome guy is handsome!""  Lastly, I mentioned that these were my personal pet theories, and that I wasn't being scientific about it. I've gathered the evidence and formed the theories entirely based on anecdotal evidence, and I decided to ask /r/bisexual about it simply because I knew there would be differing opinions, evidence, points of view, things I hadn't thought of, and more. I would say that's taking things with a pinch of salt. I'm more secure in some of my theories than others, but none of them are set in stone."

bisexual,37xeze,ahatmadeofshoes12,0,Sun May 31 12:13:54 2015 UTC,I feel similar. Not a fan of gooey bits. But my preference isn't skewed towards either gender in particular.
bisexual,37xeze,F-BOTHways-M,2,Sun May 31 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"I might be the opposite of this, though I would never say things like ""I just need to EAT SOME PUSSY"" in the same way. I'm a cis guy, and I typically find myself in relationships with cis guys, though I'm also really attracted to trans men in a way that I hope is as non-fetishistic as possible. The only thing that I really like to do with girls is eat them out (but I really like it). I like men and I like vaginas/the genitals of AFAB folk. Maybe it's some kind of internalized misogyny thing or something that prevents me from actually liking the rest of women or something, but that's how it goes for me."
bisexual,37xeze,jakelove12,2,Sun May 31 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"I'm also really attracted to trans men in a way that I hope is as non-fetishistic as possible   I just wanted to chime in on this since I am a trans guy. Generally gay and bisexual guys who have an admiration for pre-op trans men are welcomed by the gay and bi trans male community. It's approached differently than the men who are attracted to trans women. Generally guys attracted to trans men seem to be more open and less ashamed, and less likely to try and get some on the 'down low'. There's much less risk for hurt feelings, and overall there seems to be less...stigma from the younger gay and bisexual crowd. (There are a few older gay guys who are very dismissive of everything that isn't The One True Way To Be Gay, but nobody likes them very much. :P)  The only shit I've ever really gotten is from gay cis male bottoms, but their issue seemed to be more with their own inadequate feelings rather than based on anything other people were saying.  So, yes, you can definitely be non-fetishistic, even in just a casual hook-up situation, provided everyone is on the same page and is down!"
bisexual,37xeze,arbivark,3,Mon Jun 1 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely! And thanks! I mean I think there are ways to be fetishistic and non-fetishistic with trans men and trans women, and I was trying to say that I'd like to think my ways of approaching trans guys is more on the non-fetishizing side. For me, I try to be as respectful as possible, and part of what that means is trying to keep my excitement and entitlement about what I can and can't do in check, in addition to the usual sensitivity to boundaries, etc., which I think are important with AFAB folk and trans folk, so doubly so for trans men.  I think there's still stuff that has to be unpacked about what it means To Be Someone Who Likes Trans People, since I think it's still kinda eroticizing something very personal and oftentimes painful for those partners, and saying things like 'I like trans folk' / 'I don't like trans folk' implies that they're different than their cis counterparts. But I like guys, I like vag, and I'm a fan of vages on guys, and I wish there was good language for making these nuances. But it definitely helps that I'm bisexual, I think :P"
bisexual,37xeze,pancakeonmyhead,2,Sun May 31 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely! And thanks!

You've basically got it down pat! The way you're approaching trans guys, it sounds like you're approaching them as people with individual quirks and boundaries and whatnot, which is definitely the way to do it. That's what is lacking in most of the guys who go after trans women. There's a sense of entitlement there, and an unspoken ""well I think it's amazing, so why the fuck are you all down about it?"", a sort of break from reality where these guys don't realize that their reaction is not 95% of the population's reaction, and it's doubly glaring if the guy is trying to meet a girl for some ""down low"" fun because he's ashamed to be seen in public with a trans woman.  So, yeah, for whatever reason, I think there's generally a difference in how guys approach trans men and how they approach trans women. The two groups obviously don't overlap much unless you've got a bisexual person who enjoys both types of trans bodies, so it seems to be made up of mostly different people.   I think there's still stuff that has to be unpacked about what it means To Be Someone Who Likes Trans People, since I think it's still kinda eroticizing something very personal and oftentimes painful for those partners, and saying things like 'I like trans folk' / 'I don't like trans folk' implies that they're different than their cis counterparts. But I like guys, I like vag, and I'm a fan of vages on guys, and I wish there was good language for making these nuances. But it definitely helps that I'm bisexual, I think :P   I agree that there is probably a lot to unpack there, and from a psychological standpoint it fascinates me, but in the end I usually think ""you can't help what you like"". I can see where trans women might excite men who love women, but love dick as well, even if most trans women aren't going to entertain 90% of what these guys want. I can see where trans men might excite people who enjoy men, but like vaginas as well. Then there are those who aren't fond of the ""erotic illusion"" pre- and non-op trans people are visually.  Implying you like pre-/non- op people of either gender definitely puts a separation there between cis and trans people, but I think that's okay if you're just talking about us in a sexual context. A lover would have access to parts of a trans person the rest of the world doesn't see. When trans people talk about not wanting to be treated ""differently"", I think most of us are really just saying things between the lines like ""don't feel entitled to any parts of me that might be different if I'm not comfortable with that"", and ""don't treat me like a science experiment, treat me like a person"". There was a great example of what not to do when I was watching (well, too lazy to find the remote!) Nancy Grace last night, and she was talking about Caitlynn Jenner, who may or may not have to appear in court due to a traffic accident that ended up killing a woman on a bad stretch of road. Nancy kept grilling one of her guests, demanding ""She DOES still have a penis, correct? According to you, she does still retain a penis?"", trying to imply that this should, in any way, affect a court trial. She gleefully tore into what surgeries Caitlynn has had, what she may or may not have in the future, and in general just treated the entire thing like a spectacle. I think Jenner's entire life has been pretty damn scripted, but it sucks seeing the notion of being transgender picked apart that way.  But, to end a rather long comment: I think the main thing here is finding partners who don't mind those parts of themselves. While yes, I would much rather have a penis and regular male plumbing, I've decided not to demonize my own genitalia (not that there is anything wrong with this, I'm strictly speaking about myself), and I enjoy it for what it is. It doesn't make me less of a man either way. I've been with trans ladies who enjoy their genitalia as well. Finding  a compatible partner is what it comes down to in the end."
bisexual,37xeze,graymankin,2,Wed Jun 3 05:43:25 2015 UTC,"Big ups. I like talking about this stuff. Thanks for chatting :)  The one thing that makes me nervous still, and I think it's just because queer men are really, truly, utterly terrible at this, is the idea of ""well you can't help what you like"". I know what you meant by it, I think that it's partially true that we can't help what we like. You can't just wake up one morning and decide to be straight or whatever, but it doesn't mean preferences aren't analyzable or institutional or aren't affected by political realities. That's really the only reason why I bring it up and try to be very careful when talking about relations with trans folk (even though most of the problematic stuff comes up with heterosexual male entitlement towards trans women, like you point out) and my own personal relationships with women. I just think it's super important for folks to ask themselves ""why do I like this? what if I like that instead, and just never let myself consider it? how does my attraction relate to society?"" etc. I really like the idea of rejecting the whole born-this-way, preferences-are-metaphysical-things idea and thinking about sexuality as something we create and construct and reinvent and reinterpret and negotiate constantly. But that's not a popular idea so I'll leave it there.  (((((But let's be honest, it's probably not an accident that most gay men seem to prefer white, muscular, masculine guys. Unless they're even more muscular black tops with 12"" cocks, or slender (but still muscular) Asian bottoms. But no fat femmes please!!!1))))"
bisexual,37xeze,Chris770,2,Thu Jun 4 13:02:17 2015 UTC,"I enjoy chatting about this as well.  When I say ""you can't help what you like"", I say this with the caveat that almost everything you do or don't like is molded by the society within which you live and thrive. I also think sexuality can be influenced by certain preferences as well (this is completely anecdotal, but I notice that a lot of straight men gain an interest in trans women after discovering anal play, and I think they perhaps fetishize the fact that this is a woman who can, at least theoretically if we ignore the realities of being a trans woman, give them what they want in an otherwise heternormative capacity). I do think, like you mentioned, that sexuality is a fluid, ever-changing thing, and that a lot of our attitudes about sex are influenced by society. I think that perhaps the core model of sexuality within any given person is something that is set or ingrained, but that there is much more wiggle room within those set boxes than people can even imagine. One of the reasons trans people get such a violent reaction is truly because I think we make people question their notions of gender, sexuality and society as a whole. It happens no matter if you identify as gay or straight. I've had gay guys super attracted to the fact that I'm a non-op trans guy and then wonder what that meant about their ""gayness"", as if being gay had a contract written somewhere that said ""vaginas must repulse you"", and no one ever thought about if that vagina was attached to a dude or not. It's the same with trans women. I think they play into the whole notion of ""what is attraction, really?"", is it the genitals, the body, some combination of the two? Which is more important to you as an individual? What about this certain combination attracts you, if you find yourself attracted to a certain mix of sex characteristics and identity?  I think all of these questions are worth exploring, and answering. Just because something is a societal construct doesn't make it any less real for the people living it, but it is worth examining the jail cell in depth, so to speak.  As for your (((())))), gay culture is incredibly shallow at times, and it really depends on what side of the equation you fall on versus what your target of attraction is. If you're a muscular black guy who bottoms you're going to find yourself with less options. If you're an Asian top, same thing. I, fortunately or unfortunately, fit the ""trans guy stereotype"". I'm a bottom, I'm not really dysphoric about my own genitals, and I enjoy being penetrated both ways pretty equally. I'm short and kind of ottery with a tiny touch of fem. I'm everything that guys who are attracted to trans guys are looking for, if we're speaking in generalities. I just wrote another comment on /r/asktransgender where I mentioned I feel for my trans brothers who top. Nobody wants a trans guy who tops, unless he's had phalloplasty.  As for femmes, hah, I really feel for them there! I absolutely adore femme guys, and when I find out a femme guy is a top? You can guarantee I'm going to investigate what he thinks about trans guys! :P (A lovely femme top sort of turned me onto that!) I think if there is truly a ""most discriminated against"" in cis gay culture it is probably the femme top. He's 'not man enough to top', and not 'man enough' to bottom either! Gay culture can be shallow sometimes, and as someone who has had enough of playing the field, it can be exhausting as well."
bisexual,37xeze,Chris770,2,Thu Jun 4 22:41:17 2015 UTC,On the other end of the spectrum I've met a lot of bi curious women who love to kiss and touch and be touched by women and who find women's bodies attractive but aren't into eating another woman's pussy. I don't understand it personally considering I'm firmly bisexual and haven't come across any gender or genitals I haven't liked but it's something I've noticed with some of the bi curious women I've been involved with.
bisexual,37xeze,Chris770,2,Fri Jun 5 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this as well. I don't have much time for people like that since I'm pretty much firmly in the ""all genitals are awesome!"" category. But yeah, the women who aren't into pussy are probably wrapped up in theory number 3. It takes a strong person in a way, to overcome society's shaming and misinformation and to learn to love that part of your anatomy (something I've had extra trouble with being a trans guy) and know that it's awesome despite what you might be hearing. I think bicurious women are often caught up in that same shame spiral. They're often not even fond of their own, much less another woman's. I think a lot of it has to do with social conditioning and the air of uber-privacy around women's genitals."
bisexual,37xeze,MapsAndCharts,2,Sat Jun 6 09:03:15 2015 UTC,Yeah very true. It just makes me sad really because vaginas are awesome and the best way to give them pleasure is to touch and lick them. The more people are afraid to do this the less pleasure for everyone.

I try to only associate with open minded people to begin with but do not necessarily seek a specific type of person. That said, all of my friends are fine with openly bisexual and gay people so long as you don't attempt to shove it on them. If a person isn't ok with it, I don't talk to them. As far as dealing with haters, so to speak, I smile because I'm comfortable with who I am and they obviously have unresolved personal issues if they are so concerned with a person's actions that have zero effect on them. Let them be mean, they have to live with themselves."
bisexual,37y8nq,dcsnowpatrol,1 point,Sun May 31 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"I relate with you in that I feel like a label doesn't accurately describe me.

I also choose to be around open minded people who are interested in similar things to me.  I feel that I do have a community of friends and people I like to be around.  I haven't told them all, ""Hey, sometimes I like guys as well as girls.""  But I know that the people I'm around wouldn't bat an eyelash if I did tell them.

Focus on what you enjoy.   I'm a guy, and I've known I'm attracted to men too for a very long time. I didn't have the words for it, for awhile. I felt so much pressure when I was around girls that I liked, that it was hard for me to enjoy straight relationships too. Anyway, I eventually realized, I'm fully attracted to women and fully attracted to men. It's not either/or for me.  Again, focus on how YOU feel. I don't think you need to worry about labels right now. Just go with what feels right. I think you're doing the best you can.

bisexual,37vvr5,throwaway-717,4,Sat May 30 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I feel like I'll just stick to avoiding any labels and I guess I still have some time to work it out, attraction is a very complex thing and I doubt I'll ever fully understand it and I can only begin to comprehend it. No one is pressuring me as no one really knows so I guess I'll just go through life as an enigma and along the way who knows maybe I'll come to the realisation of what it all means  :)  Also,  wow this community is ridiculously welcoming and helpful, if I had to talk to someone about this where I live it'd probably just be like, 'pray the gay away' or 'it's just a phase', that is if I'm not bombarded with threats first from the conservatives who believe that they are truly omnipotent and they are right about everything."
bisexual,37vvr5,glassbottle,9,Sun May 31 10:13:31 2015 UTC,"When I was around 12-13 years old, I started fantasizing about sharing intimacy and being sexual with both boys and girls. Keep in mind this was 15 years ago. The amount of representation or information on LGBT people was negligible, or still presenting us in a very negative light. I didn't understand my feelings, so I more or less decided to be ""straight"" because that's just what was normal. It wasn't until the past couple years I've started exploring my sexuality more actively.  Today I'm a trans woman in her mid-late 20s, and obviously that complicates my experiences with sexual orientation. In the sense that as a teenager I wanted boyfriends or girlfriends, but from the perspective of a girl, except I thought I was a boy back then.  Usually my fantasies with girls would be kissy and cuddly like friends but more sexual and flirty. My fantasies with boys I wanted to be held and feel more submissive. I remember in high school rarely feeling attracted to someone specific or having a crush. Usually girls who were gothy/edgy and guys who were calm, messy haired metal/stoner types.  So basically, I knew I was bi because I wanted intimacy with both girls and boys, or the gender and parts of my partner didn't matter. This is still true today, and I date someone regardless of gender or body."
bisexual,37vvr5,thedeadwalk77,1 point,Sun May 31 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply this is really helpful, and congratulations on your transition and I hope you have the luck of living in an accepting community as it appears that all too often -  even in 'progressive' movements, trans* people are regularly exploited and thrown under the bus and there are those constantly trying to take away rights.  The part about representation stands accurate till today, in my context there have been some minor steps forward but there are still those who wish to revert us to the 6th century. Where I live, all forms of representation come from the 'west' and the first time they showed a normal, healthy relationship on a local news channel was last year, (it was Oliver and Connor from HTGAWM if that adds to anything) and it was definitely shocking because I was almost certain they would cut out the whole arc (most media here is controlled by the state) but they left it all in which I felt was a certainly good start, considering our neighbouring countries (bonus points for guessing the region!) have homosexuality as a crime that deserves the death penalty.  However, other times lesbian women are always presented as 'insane' only to be 'cured' by the Perfect Straight Man™ in various soap operas.  Finally, the part about attraction I agree with, I feel like I probably have differing opinions about attraction in between  genders but I'm assuming it's normal to kind of have a preference?

bisexual,37vvr5,light_sky,8,Sun May 31 05:04:05 2015 UTC,"I think you should wait for somebody little more experienced to answer, but I thought I'd share my insights anyway.  I'm 19 year old guy, I've known I'm bisexual for little more than a year. Coming to accept your own sexuality can be really difficult, especially since being bi means there is no clear black or white, straight or gay, and fluidity of sexuality can complicate things even more. I think the important question is, what does your sexuality mean to you? Do you really care what label you wear? Don't get me wrong, I can understand that it can help, but I think it can also burden you. Sexuality is a spectrum, it may be that you lie closer to the side of being straight than to the middle and that's why you don't feel such strong attraction to women. Don't worry, you still have a lot of time to figure it out. It took me a few years of being attracted to both men and women alike to understand that.  As far as being scared of what people may think of you, I think you should try to properly judge attitudes of individual people. I believe I'm in a similar situation to yours, I'm currently studying in one of the Poland's major cities and the general attitude of society is not that great: it's not illegal, but it's not well perceived either. If you really want to confide in somebody, you should first try to get them to talk about LGBT issues in general and look how they respond. If they react badly or dismiss you, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't come out to them unless you are really confident in yourself. Sooner or later you'll find an ally.  To me it looks like you're taking a good step forward. Joining a community, talking about your problems is the best way to solve them. I hope you'll find help and peace."
bisexual,37vvr5,somedude462,3,Sat May 30 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I read up a bit on the spectrum and I think that I definitely lie in the middle, I believe the issue is that there's not much representation of bisexuality and its always either straight or gay and never in between so it can definitely confuse some people like myself who rely on outside resources for explanation about sexual awareness.  Unfortunately, I doubt I should talk to people here because it is difficult to find people to trust, whilst the country isn't very deeply rooted in religion, people like to pick things they consider to be sinful and will condemn you endlessly for them, people will partake in all sorts of 'sinful' activities but some like the issue of sexuality are almost entirely seen as unlawful and even in my school a lot of people who come from what I thought were liberal countries like the US or UK have some truly vile thoughts concerning the matter, and word could get round quickly and whilst you won't be directly prosecuted by anyone important the community could definitely shun you.  That being said, I know two people who have 'come out' but it was under circumstances that they may not entirely remember so I think it may be rude if I go up to them about it as they may feel uncomfortable with the prospect of discussing this. I obviously don't want to put them in a position where they don't feel comfortable.  But most of the responses here seem to say that it's best to rely on feeling and not to focus on labels so I think I'll stick to that particular train of thought :)"
bisexual,37vvr5,donnagem,5,Sun May 31 10:38:35 2015 UTC,"I feel as if I have a general attraction to girls that I just realised about and I don't get it   The thing about same-sex attraction is (and especially the more repressive the environment you grow up in), it can actually be really hard to understand that you experience it. You grow up taught that anything gay is ""the other,"" a completely different species; you can't imagine that you might be part of that ""other"" (when I was little I just assumed gay people were born with a secret tattoo or something that marked them as different, and I couldn't possibly be anything but straight because even though I liked girls I didn't have that tattoo--it's both funny and sad) and the societal messages are so intense and subliminal that you can't even recognize your feelings for what they are. Also part of my difficulty in recognizing I was bi was that my attractions to girls were so natural it took me years to consciously recognize them as ""unnatural"" attractions. (I never stopped to wonder, just always assumed, that other girls felt the way I did about girls--because again, if it were the case that I was the ""different"" one, wouldn't I know, wouldn't my attractions feel wrong? But nope, the attractions are natural; it's the societal bias that makes them then feel wrong.) Basically what I'm trying to say is it is 100% possible and I think actually very common to have same-sex attraction and not really realize it. Figuring out your sexuality can be tough for so many reasons, and certainly living in a conservative place doesn't help, but having that first spark of awareness that you might not be straight is the first step to better figuring yourself out. You might be straight, you might not be; the point is, you're not assuming the default about yourself, and that's important, and will allow you to better, more honestly examine your feelings. It's through this kind of examination that you can then figure out your sexuality. Look at girls and think about how they make you feel; how do you want to relate to them? It can also be tricky because often as girls it can be hard to distinguish if we like a girl or just think she's pretty/admire her/want to be her. These are the kinds of feelings to sift through and think about. Good luck!"
bisexual,37vvr5,amandatru,3,Sat May 30 22:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yes! Honestly this just describes my whole situation quite well and almost 100%. Being gay or even discussing sexuality is a completely taboo subject so it's difficult to come to terms with it and this is why I came here because I felt as if the advice would be helpful, and it was! I agree with the societal bias here, luckily my parents seem to be quite accepting and always taught me values of respect so I don't experience that kind of fear and rejection others do, although I doubt I would come out to them as I don't even understand the situation myself.   I slept on it and I guess that gender doesn't really matter to me in terms of attraction? Although maybe I might have a preference but it's hard to tell if it's because I'm more attracted to guys or I'm just trying to fit in, I guess I never thought about because I just assumed that I would just fit into the straight mould but this presented a slight dilemma to my uninformed mind.   Thanks for the advice and I hope all is well with you :)"
bisexual,37vvr5,carlyfannyonyourface,4,Sun May 31 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"I don't label myself for conversation. Sexuality is far too fluid and has too many variables to put into a word or two.  To answer your question...I was, am, and always will be a nerd. I'm always looking to expand, improve, and understand the why about all things, especially sex. I used to watch a lot of amateur porn exclusively to learn about what normal people did in the bedroom and compare myself to it. I watched a lot of women together to learn what they liked, threesomes to learn the dynamics, and so on. I even had a notebook.  One day I got turned on by a video and I realized it wasn't because I was fantasizing about what she was doing to him, it was because I wanted to be her. It was pretty strange at first so I notated it under a new section in my notebook with details on what was going on in the video. After a few times of this happening I re-read my notes and realized that I really was attracted to men but in a different way than women. I'm a bit girly anyways so I guess it fits lol  The point is, who cares? The only opinion on this subject that should matter is yours. I don't go around broadcasting it myself but I also associate with open minded, gay, straight, and bisexual people. Some of those people came from their country because of the oppression and often deadly repercussions of who they are. I wish you luck and hope this helps."

That's how I knew.   And then years later I heard the word bisexual and i was like 'oh, there's a name for it? Cool! I guess that's what I am then!' :)   I don't ever remember a time since I've felt attractions to others that both men and women haven't fallen victim to my crushes!   Having said that, my first physical partner was a guy. I fell pregnant young and kept the baby. I later broke up with him and fell in love with my best friend (another guy) and we've been together ever since. It wasn't until just over a year ago, at 35, that I finally got to experience being physical with another woman and it was even better than I imagined it to be - and I'd been imagining it for a very long time."

Girls made me feel funny. I wanted to look at boobs. I didn't get it back then.  You don't have to tell anyone in your community if you don't want to. Just keep going along and live your life.

I would just take your time with discovering what you like. You may just be interested in girls right now and it could pass, or it could get stronger. Don't put any pressure on yourself to come out or to label yourself. Right now is a great time to explore who you are, because even beyond sexuality you're getting to know who you are as a coming of age adult."

bisexual,37vvr5,CalamitousD,2,Sun May 31 05:22:34 2015 UTC,"When I was young, I was incredibly confused about my sexuality. Up until Freshman year of highschool, I believed I was some form of asexual, but I'd always thought that, no matter what, I could only ever be with a woman because I was a weird little Christian kid who had no idea what I felt. So I dated my first girlfriend and she was cool and stuff, but we were way too different. Then, this year, Junior year, I was backstage at a play my school was performing and I was talking to my friend who's very into philosophy about happiness and the meaning of life, etc.. The talk invigorated me, I felt like a new man. The first act ended. We were going back again for the second act when this guy who I'd had a steamin' crush on for awhile walked backstage and said, 'I have cherry chapstick on, somebody kiss me'. I, still feeling amazing from the talk replied with an, 'okay'. He told me that he'd never kissed anybody before, I said nothing back and leaned in to kiss him. He gripped my torso aggressively and planted a surprisingly long french kiss on my lips. I felt my entire being rise and I had an enormous epiphany, I'm bisexual, and all of those things I'd felt for my entire life were real. It was probably the greatest thing I've ever felt and I slaughtered the second half of the play. A few days later, I asked him out."
bisexual,37vvr5,Towerz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"The great thing about being 15 is that you have plenty of time to figure everything out. At 15 nobody quite knows what they like. Your friends are probably figuring out if they like people with brown hair or blonde, hipster or clean cut style, muscled or not, jokesters or someone more serious. Gender is just one more aspect of figuring out what you want in a partner. Sadly society doesn't see it that way, so it seems more complicated, but pay attention to what you're feeling. What attracts you to other people? Remember you don't have to have the answer any time soon. I am in my mid-twenties and am still figuring a lot of it out."

One day, when I was 16, I just started finding a particular friend of mine interesting to look at and think about that way. Never have come up with anything like a reason for it, and though I've been told I supposedly always had those feelings and were just suppressing them, no amount of wracking my brain trying to remember anything I ever thought or felt bears that out. I went through this period thinking my own brain was betraying me or something, then tried my best to just ignore it. That probably would have been simple enough, considering there're very few guys I find interesting sexually (though when I do, it's quite powerfully so,) but I eventually got used to the idea and decided to just indulge it if given the opportunity. (I've also had the freakish good luck of meeting a guy I'm mutually compatible with, and don't really expect that to happen again.) That's really all there is to tell.  *Grammar correction"

I remember walking to school with my boyfriend saying ""you know i think I could date guys or girls as long as I loved them"" which I look back on as really the first moment I said it but I didn't understand what I was saying.  Now the year after this I had a hard time at school, lost a bunch of friends and was just not happy so I forgot all about girls. After that was grade 9. AKA when girls really got boobs. And we had gym class. I think this really helped out in my realization.  Eventually while online I found the word bisexual and after all that time of it I looked back and realized even as a kid all of my closest friends, I had had crushes on.

I don't know if you're working or have an established support system in place.  If you don't, build that first before coming out to your parents.

Tbh I'm kind of ashamed that i was in denial and can't believe that i thought this way for so long. (i'm 15)"
bisexual,37v3m7,sydsaysnothing,14,Sat May 30 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"For me at least, I didn't immediately feel differently. What makes it great is no longer having to be careful what you say, playing the pronoun game, pretending not to notice the hot people of your own gender. It's just a lot of stuff you don't have to worry about anymore when you're talking to them in the future."
bisexual,37v3m7,ganderso,5,Sat May 30 18:38:37 2015 UTC,"Try talking to your friends about it again and ask them how they feel about it, or whether one of them maybe has a problem with it or not. When I came out to my friends there was no reaction at first either but a couple days or maybe a week later I asked them what they thought about it. They still didn't really say much, only that they have no problem with it. At first it also really didn't make me feel any better but after a while I understood that it doesn't really matter what my friends think about me and that only what I think about myself matters.  Hope this helps at least a bit!"
bisexual,37v3m7,juli7xxxxx,3,Sat May 30 17:35:03 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea, I think I'm stressing over it because I don't know what they think. This made me feel a bit better, Thank you."
bisexual,37v3m7,light_sky,4,Sat May 30 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's normal. When I first had a big coming out, I felt absolutely awful afterwards. I felt really vulnerable and ashamed. But with a little time I was able to be proud of myself for having that courage and being open with people was so much better than being closeted had been. Maybe closer to your experience, I've also had times where I've come out to people and it almost feels like I haven't said anything at all. For a lot of people it's simply such a non-issue, and for others they don't really know what to say/don't want to make a huge deal of it. But even if others don't act like it's a big deal, it's a big step for you, so pat yourself on the back!"
bisexual,37v3m7,zyguy,3,Sat May 30 19:11:16 2015 UTC,"Listen, I'm not saying you're anything like me, but every time I have ever come out I IMEDIATELY regretted it the next day or two. I never had reason to regret it, I always chose people who reacted well and I was relieved. But I think there is a societal shame build-up still in the back of my subconscious that I just admitted I'm not the perfect example of masculine. After the first day I always seem to have those regret feelings blow over. Especially, when I can talk openly about it with those people another time. And you know what they say, it gets easier. The more you come out, the easier it is to come out. The first time I did it, I had to write a huge letter and hide somewhere. The next time was over text. The next time I had to be asked point blank before I could just nod. Now I can just talk about it when I feel like it."

bisexual,37uwi5,bayleythrow,3,Sat May 30 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's very possible that the bisexuality is not so much the thing to work on here, but rather the more important underlying issue has targeted the bisexuality as an object of fixation. Sometimes things like anxiety may be manageable for a long time and then suddenly spike and get a lot worse. These things are due to chemicals in our brains, and are therefore totally inexplicable by reason. Also, conditions like anxiety feed off of our own thoughts and worries (take it from me--I've had OCD my whole life), so it's easy to think it's something we're actually worried about and not see that it's actually brain chemistry gone haywire. I'd recommend you see a therapist. If during your daily life you're feeling good about your bisexuality and you're out to your friends and family, I would try to hold on to that, and when you get the intrusive thoughts try to recognize them as irrational and coming from outside of you. Again, I'd really recommend you see a therapist. I have friends who have had really positive experiences with medication for similar issues. Good luck!"
bisexual,37uwi5,light_sky,2,Sat May 30 19:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't think you need to act any different now that you are openly out about you bisexuality. Just continue to be you and if anything embrace the fact that those closest to you were really open and accepting of your decision to be open about it. Don't be afraid to look to them for support either. I think now that you are open you shouldn't feel compelled to act any different. You are still you just a more free and open version of you that needs to learn to be more comfortable in your skin. Going forward know that it seems like you have a support system in place ready to help you through anything and the there's always the random folk ere who will try and help you through whatever. :)
bisexual,37uwi5,totallyabear,2,Sat May 30 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"So, I've had very similar experiences. Not as extreme, but close. And interestingly, almost always late at night.  I did some looking into it, and I found something interesting. Men have a daily testosterone cycle which affects our mood and emotions. It's highest in the morning, and lowers throughout the day. When it's too low, it can cause self doubt, insecurities and so on.  There's a lot of very mundane things that can help with this. Getting enough sleep. Having a regular sleep schedule. Eating well. Regular exercise. I started doing all those things, and I can say I feel a lot better about myself now than I did previously.  Is it going to fix everything? No, probably not. It's still worth a try. Put everything you can in your favor and all that.  And if it persists, it's definitely worth talking to a doctor, or a mental health professional."
bisexual,37uwi5,VDRawr,1 point,Sat May 30 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"I've had a little experience with a partner who has anxiety problems, and I have mild panic attacks very infrequently (maybe twice in my life). Big attacks seem to be triggered by stressful events, coming out is pretty stressful as you're asking your friends and family to acknowledge a true identity that they may not be comfortable with.  Some excellent advice for anxiety, in my opinion, was given by the journalist Caitlin Moran in her book (sorry for the long quote, but it's really good):   What started as a common amount of anxiety started to grow larger and larger – first disrupting my heartbeat, then filling my lungs, until, eventually, it blew out the sides of my head. Then, through the broken skull, the monkeys came – six million chattering monkeys of evil, screeching out each worry ever invented.  Wow. I wasn’t expecting the monkeys. It was like Pandora’s Box, in reverse. I tried, desperately, to handle it for 20 minutes – but was simply outnumbered by malignant primates. I gave up and passed out.  And, when I came round, it wasn’t all a dream at all – I was still panicking, and I continued to panic, even in my sleep, for the next five weeks, pretty much non-stop.  Of course, something bad that happened in 1997 is, by 2011, not bad any more: just funny. That’s physics. Then, I didn’t know this was “just” panic – panic is running for a train while trying to get your ticket out of your bum bag. This, by way of contrast, felt like a combination of heart attack and insanity. I thought I was both losing my mind and dying and so, obviously, I, a) gave up all drugs immediately, and b) bought a bicycle, on which I spent four hours a day cycling up and down every hill in North London, trying to “sweat it out”.  As it turns out, the cure for anxiety disorders is not actually “getting sweaty in Archway”. The medical profession would have prescribed a massive whack of benzodiazepine, but I was worried that a GP would tell me off for smoking skunk while watching BBC Two (“It’s an obviously risky behaviour, Ms Moran!”) and so I never went. One friend recommended taking acid – “It’ll BURN the panic out!” – but he was the man who’d also claimed that he could “live in a hedge, on a handful of rice”, so I politely ignored him.  Do you know what worked, in the end? Telling myself to shut up. Setting up a series of huge, foot-thick iron doors in my head, and learning to clang them shut as soon as the monkeys started talking.  It took a while – I’d never tried to curb my imagination before. As a child, I’d been able to lie in bed and imagine faces coming out of the ceiling so vividly, I’d end up having to climb inside my duvet, for protection. And, at first, there was almost a perverse temptation to leave the doors open a little – test myself with a little monkey chatter, to see if I could cope with it, in the same way you test a mouth ulcer with the tip of your tongue.  But the result was always the same: escalation, pain, panic, weeping, wearily saying, “Why have I done this?” at 3am, after hours and hours of unhappiness.  And so, eventually, I learnt not to go near monkey-friendly corridors – thoughts about mortality or insanity – until, eventually, the door handles became dusty with lack of use, and whole decades passed, and I forgot what the monkeys sounded like. The spell that kills them is, simply, “SHUT UP!”  Of course, it’s not totally over. Sometimes – when I’m hung over, or very tired, or go a bit too bongo mondo with the coffee pot – the monkeys will mount a sudden surge, breach the walls and swarm. Christmas Eve was bad. I find it very difficult in hotels away from my kids. And looking at Jools Holland makes me nervous. But: shut up. It’s the best thing I ever learnt.

bisexual,37t5dr,Innunim,7,Sat May 30 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so, here is the thing : in my experience, porn can indeed be somewhat useful when we're in the process of figuring out what we like, but it isn't and shouldn't be taken as the most reliable indicator. And neither is ""the real thing"", for that matter, some sexual relationships can be utterly unenjoyable due to incompatibilities that have nothing to do with the sexual orientation of those involved. Being bisexual does imply that we are attracted to moe than one gender, but this doesn't that we are attracted to every gener in the same way. Maybe seeing a naked woman does not arouse you, but sight is far from being the only sense that matters when it comes to attraction. When we meet an attractive person, sure, we might like what we see, but this person also has a way of talking, of moving, of behaving, a distinct and unique body odor, etc... What about the women you see in real life ? Those you can talk to, connect to ? Are you attracted to some of them ? If so, are you physically attracted, romentically attracted, both ? And is thisattraction strong enough to be relevant to the way you define yourself and your experiences ? If you're not attracted, do you think you could be ? For the record, I'm a bisexual woman and couldn't care less about naked men - tough I do enjoy lesbian porn. Does that make me a lesbian ? I don't think so. Because I know that I can be very attracted to some men (and some non-binary folks) under some specific circumstances, I know that my sexuality can be fluid, etc... So it feels better to call mysef bi/pansexual. And if it feels better to you too, go for it :)."
bisexual,37t5dr,Cakyresp,3,Sat May 30 13:09:29 2015 UTC,"Arousal in response to porn, and attraction to a person in real life, are totally different things.  It's totally okay, and common, for a person, bi or otherwise, to have different preferences in these areas--there are gay guys who like straight porn, there are lesbians who like gay porn.  You could try to compare your porn response to how you react to meeting new people of either sex, or noticing attractive strangers walking down the street.  That said, you'll be happier if you don't think about it too much, experience life to the fullest while you're young, and sort it out later."

bisexual,37qk0l,MasqueRaccoon,12,Fri May 29 23:05:15 2015 UTC,"There was a perception among some folks that ""bisexual"" excluded folks who didn't identify explicitly as male or female. So they came up with pansexual to be more inclusive.  The problem comes from the fact that many bi folk don't discriminate like that, while a few pan folk try to present themselves as more open-minded than bi folk.  Best you can take away from it is that some folks identify as bisexual, others as pansexual, and neither is ""better"" or ""more correct"" than the other. It's just how they prefer to identify."
bisexual,37qk0l,jazzoveggo,5,Sat May 30 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"This is a good explanation.  Also, just to add to it, pansexual can also mean that gender just isn't a factor in who you're attracted to, which I think is subtly different from being attracted to men, women, and other genders. I would describe myself as panromantic more than pansexual, per se, but to me that means I'm attracted to... personalities, I guess.  Like, my current SO is a man, but attraction-wise I couldn't care less what his gender is.  It's just not an important characteristic to me.  Again, though, I think I've heard bisexual people describing what I've described, so I don't think this is pansexuality-exclusive."

I never thought myself as bi untill a few years ago. I'm 19.   I'm still not sure if I'm just bi curious or bi, it all came to my mind then, I always thought I was straight, but I kind of had an anal addiction since my young teens, although I didn't try anything there untill later.  When I watch porn I always imagine I'm the girl being fucked by the guy, and I mostly watch anal, I guess due to me not having a vagina.

I always REALLY liked blowjob porn. It was, and still is, my favorite. The first time I remember having any kind of gay thoughts was watching some chesty blonde blow some hung guy, and thinking ""wow, she's taking that dick like a champ. That's a really nice dick... I wonder how much of it I could get in my mouth, and how the head would feel on my tongue""... wait, wtf? Lol. Most of the time when I watch a girl giving head I'm more aroused by the thought of being the one giving the blowjob than receiving.   I definitely dig anal porn as well. When I see those videos I want nothing more than to have some stud push my face into the floor and make me his bitch. I love being submissive. Sometimes I do wish I could be a girl so I could show my appreciation for dick without worrying about labels. I'd be the girl that all the boys liked lol.   I don't think I'm Trans or anything either, but the submissive side of me definitely can relate to wanting to be ""the girl""."

It's a complicated thing. But I HAVE had fantasies about being with guys since I was a teenager. Basically as soon as I was sexually mature, it was there. I haven't exactly had much actual experience with guys, but I have had enough to know that it's not just curiosity, or a hypothetical fantasy."
bisexual,37skkp,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,1 point,Sat May 30 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"I've posted here before, but it was a reply and not very well organized, so here is my sexual development.  Well I never took hormones and my sexual development wasn't instantaneous as I got out of the womb.  I had no interest in sexuality when I was a kid, I thought sex was gross, and I remember I said I'd never do those sort of things...  I started masturbating I was a kid, but I didn't even realize it was sexual, it was just fun for me.  Then I began thinking sexually, I found women attractive and not men, I had no interest in men, but I kind of had a thing for my butthole...  When I turned 17 I started to dabble into bisexuality, I didn't think I was bi, I was still attracted to women, but as I was a male sub, I was kind of interested on how gay sex was.  I tried watching gay porn, and while I can do it, it doesn't do much to me, so I stuck to heterosexual porn  Then I realized everytime I watched porn, I pretended I was the girl, I always watched anal sex, which is probably because I have that anal addiction and I could pretend I was the girl, I have no vagina, so it doesn't work very well, obviously.  I have grown an obsession for penis, I never watched blowjob porn, but now I do, I still pretend I'm the girl. So I guess I'm not completely bisexual as my interest in males is more for their genitals rather than anything else, but I'd still date one, if not for the social problems assigned to doing so. I don't think imagining I'm the woman makes me transexual, although I wish I was one, I don't exacly have a problem with my penis, but I don't feel much for it like other guys seem to.  I am now 19, which I know, isn't exacly later in life, but I can say that I wasn't bi from day one, or at least, it wasn't revealed to me yet."
bisexual,37skkp,Something_Else2,1 point,Sat May 30 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"I was a late-bloomer to acknowledging that I'm open to both men & women.  My sexual & romantic interest was to women exclusively all the way up until my early 30s.  As I look back, there were signs and indications that might've revealed my attraction to other men as well.  But, I truly believed that there was no such thing as bisexuality [especially, within men] - which then led me to the false conclusion that I must be totally straight then.  What changed my perspective was access to hearing different perspectives via the internet.  You mentioned that you're in your mid 40s.  Well, then you can understand clearly how different information and topics of this sort are exchanged compared to when the internet was something distant in the early 90s.  What made things worse was that when the media decided to tackle this subject, they made it into a spectacle and typically casted a negative light or an element of ""otherness"" towards the LGBT to reduce any semblance of compassion or empathy towards them.  However, w the popularity of the internet and actual LGBT people getting a chance to share their story online in their own words and own voice...well, the narrative has changed dramatically for the better.  Now in 2015, it's absurd to think that the love that an LGBT has for their lover is somehow less than the love that a heterosexual has for theirs.  However, just 10yrs ago that wasn't the case; people would stridently argue that it was indeed different and inferior.  I think information & education has helped all of us become more aware and astute and open to the spectrum of sexuality.  I find that the younger generation is extremely fortunate to bypass the fallacious arguments & false narratives that my generation grew up with.  I am hopeful that at least this generation won't waste time/years buying into the false choice that: One is either gay or straight.  Or love isn't real unless it's from a man and a woman.  Dunno if I answered your question...kinda was just thinking out loud I guess."

(I'm wondering what exactly his job entailed now! )  The people over in /r/relationships are most likely approaching your post from a layman's perspective. You've got a good grasp on words, it's obvious you're not illiterate, and there's a bit of a flair for the dramatic.  However, these skills do not a writer make. In order to write actual gay erotica you need to be proficient in much more than just a simple knowledge of what sucking off some guy's cock feels like or taking a cock in your ass as another man is like (and in fact some of the most prolific writers in the genre are heterosexual women). You need to have actual story building skills, a knack for writing fiction, and a solid grasp on the market and where to best sell said skills.  Right now, while decent, your story reads like gay Penthouse Forum.  I want to point something out, assuming this is a real recounting of events and not just someone getting his rocks off:  You are most definitely embellishing these fantasies. In all honesty I'm sure both Ryan and you were not young bisexual bucks, you were not the casanovas of blowjobs. The reality of it was more likely something along these lines: You were desperate teenage boys. Rubbing your dick against a pillow would have been amazing at that age, so having a friend so willing to indulge in libidinous activities with you must have been absolutely mind blowing. You were both as pimply and gangly as your high school photos suggest, and your memories (fantasies) are being far too kind.  Does this mean you aren't bisexual? Of course not. But I do think, especially if these stories represent the true nature of your fantasies, that you have inflated these fantasies to something reality could never match simply because it never was the reality."
bisexual,37rmfo,TheLonelySamurai,2,Sat May 30 08:05:44 2015 UTC,"Once upon a time I was paid to review and critique writing such as yours.  I had to give it up; they couldn't ever pay me enough to continually suffer through this stuff.  My advice: keep your day job.  On the other hand, if you sincerely want to write fiction, and make some money at it, with a little bit of effort and work, you do have enough to build on.  The competition is not really that great.  Now, assuming that this is not fiction, but an honest portrayal of your experiences and feelings, all I can say is that you are your own problem.  Not your wife, not what you did when you were young, not drugs.  Stop looking for excuses to enjoy what you fantasize about.  Sex between men is just as  natural as between men and women.  It is fun, satisfying, and fulfilling, and socially redeeming.    Instead of trying to make your fantasies into literature, I think you might get more out of putting that energy into communicating your feelings about yourself to your wife."

Just prepare a ""not comfortable saying"" answer in advance.  That being said, wear anything you want! I've seen chicks in a good t-shirt and jeans and chicks with a more ""dance-y"" outfit. Whatever makes you feel comfortable, confident and not too vulnerable! :) Also, ask the friends you're going with to introduce you to everyone and everything including their favorite bartenders! Ask them if they'd be comfortable with you following them around for most of the night.

bisexual,37oxx5,Feeling_thrownaway0,4,Fri May 29 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"You have a few interesting options to choose from.   Part of being bi means that your attraction to one sex doesn't diminish your attraction to the other. You could put serious dating on hold for right now and explore what it's like with both genders, and then make a more informed decision from there.   Also, if what you eventually want is a monogamous relationship, you'll have to sacrifice being with one gender for the other. This doesn't invalidate your bisexuality, it simply means you have found someone who satisfies all of your needs, and you are content to not have any other partners. However, not everyone chooses monogamy..."
bisexual,37oxx5,LicensedProfessional,2,Fri May 29 10:44:42 2015 UTC,"All great advice but I'd like to say that I don't think that being in a monogamous relationship means you've found someone who satisfies all your needs, but I don't think that's possible in any relationship, regardless of genders. I think that it means you've found someone that you're willing to make sacrifices for and you get so much more in return. That doesn't mean though that you won't still wish they were a little more dominant/submissive, or that they liked to cuddle a bit more, or that their mother wasn't so crazy or whatever! Like Dan Savage says, ""you're always grateful, you're always sorry.""   BTW, I generally prefer monogamy, so I'm definitely not saying it's bad. I'm also not saying I'm right, just that different people will have different opinions on what monogamy is."

I've been through pretty much the exact same thing and I know I've read about a ton of other people having similar experiences.   For almost all of my life, I was only ever attracted to girls, but in my early 20s I started letting my self explore my attraction to men, but I was still way to nervous (about all kinds of things, but mostly how society and future girlfriends would react) to actually do anything sexual with a guy. But as I was exploring that attraction in my mind but not letting myself act on it it started building and building and I had the same experience as you. I was having trouble getting hard with women even though I was definitely attracted to them (and once that happens, you're so nervous it will happen again that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy). I even found myself hooking up with some attractive girls and spending most of the time fantasizing about being in her position! I was really worried I might just be gay, or worse, hetero-romantic but homosexual. I finally took the attitude of ""Fuck it. I just am what I am,"" and that helped me relax a lot.   When I was finally able to experience sex with guys, I figured out pretty quickly that I'm not gay. I enjoyed myself and would definitely do it again, but it's just not the same as with women for me.   So anyway, just try and relax. It's not important ""what you are."" Anyone worth your time won't care. I know that's cliché but it's true. So just take things as they come and try not to worry!"

Any straight or gay person can be a huge unethical slut and hurt people. That's really what people mean to say when they accuse bisexuals of being sluts, but the language isn't there. This is how I have to go about defending myself because yeah, I'm definitely non-monogamous."

What they don't realize is that if I got divorced, I would still be open to a relationship with a woman, or even having a woman be a part of our married relationship, similarly to your situation. I guess what I'm trying to say is that my bisexual stereotype is that I was just confused or greedy before. Or even that I was a slut or something. I've decided a lot of people don't even understand the concept of bisexuality."

Someone who used to date a member of the same-sex and now dates a member of the opposite-sex: Of course, you only CLAIMED to be queer for attention. Now that you've settled down, you chose the ""easy"" way. OR. ""You only went through a face/experimented, now that you've matured you picked a side/are straight""  Someone who dated a member of the opposite-sex, and now is in a same-sex relationship: Told ya! Bisexuality is a stepping stone to being gay. He/she was too afraid to come out as gay!  Someone who only dated same-sex OR opposite-sex individuals: You can't really be bisexual if you've only been with men/women! You just want attention!"

bisexual,37nnny,throwaway18367,3,Thu May 28 23:40:49 2015 UTC,"""Bisexual, homoromantic, bi-social"" is pretty much where I count myself. I can be friends with either gender, I can be sexually attracted to either gender, but I'm only comfortable romantically and in LTRs with women. It took me a long time (think decades, not years) to figure out that while I like the idea of settling down with a man, I don't actually like it when it starts to happen. I guess it was complicated by the fact that I am attracted to men, or at least a certain type. I'm very picky about their looks and personality, though; I'm much less picky about looks when it comes to women and I'm somewhat more open to different personality types as long as we get along and have fun.  Anyway, most of the time, if I'm close enough to someone that discussing my sexuality is appropriate and beneficial, we're close enough that I can split romantic and sexual attractions and briefly explain them. If I need a quick label, whether I'd pick ""bisexual"" or ""bisexual, but it's complicated"" or ""lesbian"" depends on the context. For romantic LTR? Women only. For friendship and maybe a few casual keep-it-light dates while single? Either is fine.  I think whether a person chooses bisexual, lesbian/gay, or something else when is ""in-between"" when oversimplified is up to them; they're best taking the situation into account. Bisexual is the most officially correct, but most correct and most useful don't always match. So the person can decide which is most useful and when."
bisexual,37nnny,CadenceSpice,0,Fri May 29 18:17:52 2015 UTC,"It seems like most people should be bisocial. I mean, if you weren't interested in being friends with someone just because of their gender, that's kinda sad and fucked up."

bisexual,37llc8,themeanlantern,34,Thu May 28 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people's sexuality changes over time depending on hormones or experience or whatever. I know women who are lesbians now but thought they were bi before they realized that they weren't actually attracted to men, just thought they were because they always thought they were supposed to be. For some people, bisexuality is just safer than being straight-up gay. It's totally cool and okay if your sexuality/orientation changes or if your way of identifying changes.  Your orientation is personal so nobody can tell you whether it is right or wrong to identify certain ways.  Honestly, don't worry about being a stereotype. Men transitioning from bi to gay are far less of a concern and far less harmful to bisexuals than the society that enforces compulsory heterosexuality and creates situations like this in the first place."

Don't worry about stereotypes, those are formed by narrow minds, and by being yourself you will challenge them.  Our culture is changing. Rapidly!  The distinctions between gay, bi, and straight are apt to disappear in the foreseeable future.  We may start to accept that we are all just humans who have sex with other humans."

Just remember bisexuality can be on a spectrum. Its also really fluid and your preferences may change over time. I had years where I thought I would be with a woman forever, until my husband came along and although I wasn't actively seeking a male/female relationship, things just clicked.    I realize your worried about the stereotype but I think the biggest misconceptions come from people who don't really understand bisexuality. Do what makes you happy and don't try to focus on the label or the rigid definitions."

bisexual,37llc8,Evil_Eyes,2,Thu May 28 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"I found sexuality preference, while not being actually willingly/consciously wanted or chosen, to hold following true:  1) It's not ever black or what, but always somewhere in between,  2) It fluctuates, changes over time in any direction,  3) It never makes something less desired, only makes something else more  4) It is still just a preference. As in prefer red car over blue, or red wine over white.   Given all those, you have absolutely nothing to ""worry"" about. :)"
bisexual,37llc8,Zhuangzifreak,2,Thu May 28 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it. Some gay guys might chew you out for it, but please for the love of god, you are not ""the reason for biphobia"" so don't feel guilty.   It is natural for attractions to evolve over time. Heck, they could even evolve back. But the point is that you should identify with whatever label makes you feel comfortable right now. There is no pressure to be anything now or before or later. Be you, and be proud to be you."

bisexual,37llc8,Knoexius,1 point,Thu May 28 22:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm of that camp who supports a solely biological theory of sexuality, so to me your sexuality did not change. Though, the reason you no longer 'feel as bi' as you used is because you're more comfortable with yourself, with your level of homoerotism and that you are no longer putting your heteroerotic feelings on a pedestal. I say this because it has been 5 years since you accepted yourself and became less worried about trying to appear as 'straight' as you used to. Another thing could be that your environment changed and that the guys you surround yourself with are more attractive to you than the females you surround yourself with. Though in the end stop trying to put a label on yourself, it isn't like you have to label yourself (even though it helps when you're trying to accept yourself). Just stop worrying about fitting in and start bein more comfortable with who you are even if that's not exactly who you used to be or even if you honestly never were."

My personal experience is that most of us go through cycles. My friend was with women for several years and after a break up cycled into being with men for several years before cycling back to women. I've experienced similar cycles. So have many of my friends. One or two of them have had 50/50 experiences but in my small sample size, they're the minority.  On the other hand, I am friends with several gay men who ever couple of years get a little itch for straight sex. They don't want relationships with women. They don't want fuck buddies, they just have the occasional feeling of ""yeah, sleeping with a woman might be fun right now"". They are for all intents and purposes gay, but they might be technically bisexual.  I also think that bi now, gay later is probably a very natural thing for many people. If you're a man who had meaningful relationships with women but later realized that you were gay, being bi is a way to recognize your former relationships as important and not to be thought less of because of your current and future relationships. It's a way of recognizing that these were important people and events in becoming who you are. Even if it's just subconscious."

You're not under a duty to be out, and it's not morally different to closet yourself as gay rather than straight.  In general, unless homophobia / biphobia is a daily problem, people tend to be happier out than not. But in some cases people make a very reasonable and rational decision to be in the closet. In most cases, they're closeted as straight, in your case, gay. It's not for us to tell you how you should live. You live your life, and you know most about it.  However, even if your quality of life would go down if you were out, you might want to still consider it. All people (particularly people with a lot of privilege) have a moral duty to do good things. One such good thing can be helping to reduce bi erasure by coming out. But, there are other good things you can also do, like anti-homophobia activism, or donating to charity. It'd be morally commendable for you to make a self-sacrifice and come out as bi, but it's not morally required."

Assuming you haven't masturbated for a few days, an objectively attractive woman and man walks down the street. Which draws your attention?

bisexual,37g0kv,goreanddin2point0,4,Wed May 27 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a portmanteau of irrespective and regardless. Irrespective itself consists of the prefix in- (which by general English phonetics changes to ir- in this case) and respective. Similar construction for regardless, you get the idea. In current usage it seems to supplant both irrespective and regardless in informal contexts.  In English, the spelling and structure of a word are largely reliable only for determining etymology, not pronunciation (through/trough/though) or meaning. For example, look at the word pineapple. The fruit is only called that because it somewhat resembles a pinecone with its spirals, and apple was, at the time pineapple was coined, a general word for fruit. If we used your argument here, we could assume you're talking about a round, juicy fruit growing on a pine tree.  Word meanings change and shift all the time. It gets even more interesting when a word has multiple meanings that are opposite. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-antonym  As for your protest of double negatives, people seem to conflate the ""standard dialect"" with the ""only fully functional/structured dialect"". Every dialect is highly ordered and self-consistent, as it must be to be functional. Just because the rich and powerful speak in one way does not invalidate the many other rich possibilities of conveying meaning with words. You can say ""double negatives are not considered proper form in the current standard dialect of English"" and nobody would argue with you, but to protest the usage of double negatives as a whole is classist and counterproductive. It's not unique to dialects of English, either. As a common example, French currently employs double negatives as standard form.  TL;DR: Ain't no thang but a portmanteau."
bisexual,37g0kv,deyesed,1 point,Wed May 27 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Auto-antonym:       An auto-antonym (sometimes spelled autantonym), or contronym (also spelled contranym), is a word with a homograph (another word of the same spelling) which is also an antonym (a word with the opposite meaning). An auto-antonym is alternatively called an antagonym, Janus word (after the Roman god), enantiodrome, self-antonym, antilogy, or addad (Arabic, singular didd).   It is a word with multiple meanings, one of which is defined as the reverse of one of its other meanings. This phenomenon is called enantiosemy,  enantionymy or antilogy.    Image i - In English, ""inflammable"" is an auto-antonym which can mean either ""combustible"" or ""noncombustible"" so English safety labels typically use ""Flammable"". In Spanish and French ""inflam[m]able"" only means ""combustible"", so a multilingual safety cabinet can appear to be contradictory—is this a cabinet for combustible or noncombustible materials?

For me, bisexual is an attraction to the primary sexes with gender being unimportant to who I date as long as we mesh well. On the other hand, there are bisexual people who will not date intersex, androgynous, or trans people.  I just use bisexual because we have so many labels for every slight variation of sexual and romantic attraction now it is getting a bit much."
bisexual,37i2l3,mixed-bag,12,Wed May 27 21:02:38 2015 UTC,"It's blurry and messy but generally: Bisexual= attraction to more than one gender, Pansexual= attraction regardless of gender. There very close but usually matter if someone is choosing one term over the other. The history of the descriptors is complicated. Bi started as meaning meaning 'attraction to both genders' but that definition has fallen out of favor. Pan was a response to that, a way of saying your attraction isn't limited by gender or sex. Personally, I usually say bi because more people know what it means."
bisexual,37i2l3,Allosaurus_Fragilis,6,Thu May 28 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not educated in this sort of thing, but to me, a pansexual doesn't take gender into account when deciding whether he or she is attracted to someone.

bisexual,37i2l3,eg-er-ekki-islensku,9,Wed May 27 21:06:56 2015 UTC,The definition I've heard and prefee is that Bi people are attracted to more than one gender and find different things about different genders attractive.  Pan people do not have gender as a factor in their attraction at all.
bisexual,37i2l3,wingedmurasaki,12,Wed May 27 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"I view pansexual as the ultra politically correct terminology for bisexual. They use the word pansexual because they don't like the ""bi"" part of bisexual as it implies only two genders. Kind of like how many don't like the term chairman because it implies it is a role for a man and instead use terms like chairperson.  In my view it is silly to use words like pansexual because it is the same as bisexual in practical usage, and most of our words have roots that are not longer relevant.  I haven't met someone who acknowledges and cares about other gender/sexual identities who say that they exclusively not attracted to those who are not male/female."

Gender is a social construct and the only thing that matters to me is if the person I'm interested has a compatible personality. And getting another new term for every minor distinction is tedious IMHO. Everyone has their own nuances, just ask the individual to find out if you want to know.  I use and prefer bisexual to pansexual since it's more commonly understood and because I like the pride flag more. And, I see no reason to use a politically correct term.  Since bi just means ""two,"" I say ""my sex and others"" or ""both sexes"" (I know technically there are intersex folk and all that but I count them in it too, even though I have never met one to my knowledge.) I count trans folk as whatever they identify.   That said, identify however makes you comfortable."

bisexual,37i2l3,jamaicanoproblem,2,Wed May 27 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"Pan, by my understanding, is supposed to mean that your attractions are not limited by gender.  It's a more inclusive version of bisexual.  I'd say that when a person says they are bi, they at LEAST mean they like boys and girls to some extent, but someone who specifies that they are pan is making a point of including intersex, transgender, agender, genderqueer, and many/every other gender flavor out there.  If someone says they're bi, I wouldn't necessarily take that to mean that they are attracted to women and men exclusively, but I would not necessarily assume that they are not attracted to non-cis-gendered individuals, either.  Bisexual is more of a catch-all term and Pansexuals are a subset of the bisexual population.  Sort of like how all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares.  If we were being pedantic, Bisexual more specifically means an attraction to only males and females.  But practically, a lot of pansexual people (like myself) use the Bisexual label to describe themselves because it is a more palatable, understood concept for people without intimate knowledge of non-hetero sexual orientations and non-cis-genderedness.  Additionally, I feel like there is more backlash against non-cis-gendered individuals than there is against homo- and bisexuals, so while saying you are bisexual is a risky admission in and of itself in some communities, it's comparatively safe to saying (and then having to explain) that you are pansexual.  No matter how delicately you describe the reality of your own personal sexuality, this explanation will come off to the uninitiated as something like ""I BEAT OFF TO SHEMALE PORN"" and will get you labeled as a freaky, kinky pervert who shouldn't be allowed near elementary schools.  So.  Bisexual, while more properly a term for male-and-female-specific sexual attraction, is sometimes commandeered by pansexuals in order to avoid additional discomfort with people with whom only describing the broad strokes of their sexuality will suffice."
bisexual,37i2l3,aoeui-dhtns,2,Thu May 28 02:36:49 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that bisexual initially meant homosexual + heterosexual, liking your own sex and the ""opposite"" in binary terms. But now that we know the sex and gender binaries are false, of course we like other kinds of people. It's a natural extension. Pansexual is a newer word specifically for that… it's perhaps a bit friendlier to intersex and trans* people. In that sense they are synonyms except for the outdated meaning of bi.   But I also hear pan people saying that sex and gender don't matter to them; they are just attracted to individuals, or they just like who they like. Well me too, but I do like different categorical things about men and women and androgynes and so on. I see gender and I value it, and for that reason ""bi"" seems better for me."
bisexual,37i2l3,TooShortToBeStarbuck,3,Thu May 28 05:54:10 2015 UTC,"If you refer to the actual history of the usage of the word bisexual, actual bisexual people and communities never held to the transphobic / binary-centric definition, at all, and used it essentially the way pan is currently used.   The claim that it always meant ""homo + hetero"" or ""likes men + likes women"" is part of the inaccurate folk etymology inflicted on the word bisexual, to legitimize pansexual as a label. There is no actual historical precedent for it in the community itself."
bisexual,37i2l3,seirianstar,2,Thu May 28 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"Why is there so much hate in this thread? :/ The reason there are different terms is because some bisexuals won't date someone who looks like a man on the outside but has a vagina, etc. etc. Pansexuals see the person for who they are, not what parts they have."
bisexual,37i2l3,Ticiatigr,1 point,Thu May 28 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"For me, its fairly simple  Bi= likes both sexes, but not neccessarily always, do they like all genders, but that doesn't mean they can't. Some do, and some don't. Poly = most genders, or a lot, but not always All. Pan = cuts to the chase, likes both sexes, and All genders. But essentially, Pan /is/ Bi, just another subset kind of like how Demi/Grey Ace are subsets of Asexuality."
bisexual,37i2l3,AccountHaver25,1 point,Thu May 28 08:20:13 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that pansexual is a subgroup of bisexual where gender and sex don't factor in your attraction at all. The definitions are a bit blurred, I guess it is down to personal preference in labels."
bisexual,37i2l3,mweagIe,-1,Fri May 29 02:50:27 2015 UTC,For me it basically means: Bi = like both girls and boys. Pan = like anything with a heartbeat.

bisexual,37erov,avapoet,4,Wed May 27 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"Hands coming into contact with genitals is generally very safe for both parties. Unless one of you has open cuts or sores, the risk of transmission of an infection through manual intercourse is very low. You've got to weigh up the risks for yourself, of course, and it's perfectly acceptable to wear a latex glove for manual intercourse, but if you're planning on kissing then you're already exposing yourself to almost as big a risk as uncovered manual intercourse. If you're planning on manual/anal contact, though, the risk jumps up considerably.  Genitals coming into contact with mouths or with other genitals, however, carries a low-to-moderate risk of the transmission of infections. Vulva are safer than penises to perform oral sex on, but there is, as always, still a risk. Herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, and of course lice can easily be transmitted in this way. The risk comes because you're making a fluid contact. Germs love fluids: they're generally the best way to get from person to person. I'd strongly consider using a dental dam (great guide here) for these sexual encounters.  If you're planning to share toys, condoms are often a great way to keep these clean."

bisexual,37dhku,ChessPiece19,9,Tue May 26 20:55:37 2015 UTC,I have made some comments here and there and it doesn't seem to bother her. We both think Channing Tatum is quite handsome. I don't flaunt it because that would be the same as a straight guy always talking about the girls he thought were hot in front of his girlfriend.   We also tease each other when we see hot guys and girls jogging with next to no clothes on.   She's a good sport but I take care to make sure she knows I only have eyes for her.   Sorry to hear you had to drop AFROTC. I couldn't imagine how devastating it would be to have to give up something I want because of prejudice.
bisexual,37dhku,LandauTST,4,Tue May 26 21:32:28 2015 UTC,"That's great. :) Sounds like the same thing I went through yesterday...only I waited 8 and a half years to tell my current girlfriend. lol A lot of it was to do with me not being honest with myself for so long, too.

It is as upsetting as saying to your SO ""You know, girl next door has great tits and ass and beautiful eyes"". Be that as it may, there is no point in telling or worse repeating it to her. Yes, other people are sexy, and since you are not interested in that, no really need to talk about it."

bisexual,37jy3y,aoeui-dhtns,3,Thu May 28 05:36:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that doesn't mean she has more of a dating pool. Bi people often have tiny dating pools because both straight and gay people expect infidelity from us. She might be attracted to lots of people and yet starved for attention.   You're overthinking it though. You want to date her, say so. If she's into you, congratulations. There is never anything else worth thinking about no matter who you date.   Also, about this being a turnoff: Fear doesn't end your attraction, it just covers it up. Spend enough time with bi girls and get to know that they're the same as everybody else, and the fear will die down."

But isn't that idealistic, and a little rom-comish?  It's just another trait to us.

bisexual,37jy3y,VDRawr,1 point,Thu May 28 07:22:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I experience marginal attraction to guys but am way more into girls, and much prefer sex with them. Am I on the bisexual spectrum? I've always identified as 'straight'."

bisexual,37jy3y,VDRawr,3,Thu May 28 14:17:21 2015 UTC,"(Bi female) I can understand where the sentiment comes from, since (IN THEORY) dating someone who's bi means you have twice the competition.  The thing is, if she's into you, it won't matter how much competition there is: 2x zero is still zero.  I'm bi and I'm only interested in my husband: I don't want a woman any more than I want another man.  Being bi just means that I would have still fallen for my husband even if he had been a woman.  Even if you want to break this down to a simple numbers game, there are a lot more factors here than just orientation.  Some people have a very specific type, while others are open to all kinds of relationships.  Do you really think you have less competition with a straight girl who enjoys an extreme variety of men, vs. a bi girl who only likes cute nerdy guys and muscular brunette women?  And finally there's the stereotype that bi people are more inclined to want to wander, and that's completely not true.  Some bi people  miss the touch of the other gender, while others don't.  Just like there are straight people who find a relationship confining, and others who find it warm and comfortable.  Again, it's got so much more to do with the PERSON, not the orientation.  If a bi girl says she likes you, it means she picked you special out of EVERYONE she knows: guys and girls and everything in between."
bisexual,37jy3y,hyzenthlay1701,-3,Thu May 28 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well, that's the thing...while giving head I'd feel as if I had to match up to a lesbian, and I'd also feel bad forcing monogamy on her, knowing that being with me would mean no more women, ever. Quite frankly too much hassle. I live in the Bay Area so half of the girls I know, and quite a few I'm into are bi, so this is a big thing. It's limiting my potential dating pool. I'm also in my early 20s so I guess you could attribute this to my lack of experience, but it's a feeling I can't shake. I've known way too many straight guys whose bi gfs wanted to open up the relationship to fall for that 'we're not more likely to wander' routine...you are, and that's ok...generally speaking, of course. It's understandable, but you have to understand most people are not gonna be ok with it."
bisexual,37jy3y,VDRawr,3,Thu May 28 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"The whole 'I feel like I wouldn't match up to a lesbian' thing sounds like a self esteem problem.  As for bi people being more likely to want to have open relationships, no. Look, sorry dude, but I'm going to go ahead and claim that people who are bi, hang out with other bi people, and explicitly seek out a bi-focused community online probably know more about this than you do. We're not trying to 'cover up' for each other or some other nonsense. We're telling it like it is."

I've experimented a little...the head I've received from a gay guy was miles ahead of any head I've received from any girl...difference being, I'm not actually into guys, it was mere curiosity, so of course I prefer girls regardless. That being said, of course a person with the same parts is going to be more in the know, and to a girl who likes both, how would she be satisfied with me?

Let me ask you this: do you have a favorite hair color? Maybe you like blondes? Gingers more your type? Could you envision being in a relationship with a girl who doesn't have that hair color? Would you be unable to be satisfied because there's one little thing that isn't quite perfect about your partner? That sounds stupid, doesn't it?  To a lot of bi people, gender isn't particularly more important than hair color. It's just one more characteristic a person can have, and one more thing to love about the person."

Could you envision being in a relationship with a girl who doesn't have that hair color?   I do have a type, most certainly. I'm tall, so it would have to be tall, conventionally fit blondes. Taylor Swift is my dream woman. My ex girlfriend was a 5'8 brown haired girl, and I was insanely attracted to her (and still am). But isn't gender a more significant characteristic than hair color? I mean, it does change the dynamics quite a bit, and women are softer and cuter."

bisexual,37jy3y,hattrickk15,-1,Thu May 28 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"I don't usually express that preference, you know...I just flirt with whomever it is I'm attracted to. I feel like a hypocrite since I'm not exactly a Kinsey 0...I might be a 1 or even a 2, depends on the definition, but I prefer girls much more and would be insecure dating someone who's 'equal opportunity'. I get it, you can't put yourself in my shoes, and that's ok."
bisexual,37jy3y,hattrickk15,3,Thu May 28 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"Considering you're in your early 20's you say that forcing monogamy on her would mean no more girls ever, well you're assuming that you two last, but it's likely you'll break up eventually. Also, you'd be cutting her off from other guys as well. Being bisexual does mean they like both, but it could also mean gender is less of a deciding factor. It doesn't mean they need both to feel satisfied. I would state your preferences, because it's less likely she would want to date someone biphobic and you should just stick to dating someone straight. I think you'll both be better off that way. And if you think your dating pool is limited because you only want to ""date straight"" think of the bi girl, who some lesbians won't date because she's bi, some straight guys won't date because she's bi."

Props for finally being honest with the person you share your life with though.  They're always the hardest when they ought to be the easiest.  Funny huh?  I made it a point a long time ago to basically ""come out"" on the first date...My current (and likely final; going to follow Beyoncé's advice one of these days...) girlfriend embraces it completely.

You're sure handling it a lot better than many people do when a relationship gets interfered with due to going to different colleges.

Acknowledge what they are, accept them, experience them, and only once you've done that will you be able to move on. It's ok to feel hurt. It's ok to acknowledge that you feel hurt. It's ok to feel attached and to feel a sense of loss or disappointment because it's not panning out how you hoped. It is not ok to threaten suicide like your ex did. That's emotionally abusive and completely not an ok thing for him to have done to you. As long as you're respecting people's boundaries, you can feel whatever you feel."

bisexual,37e27c,MlleGateaux,2,Thu May 28 08:58:56 2015 UTC,"I never said I or any other aces seek out sex. There is a difference between sexual attraction(looking at someone and getting turned on) and arousal. There are aces in relationships with non-aces that have sex with their partners.  Just because a partner isn't sexually attractive doesn't mean that that sexual organs don't work. The person might not turn them on, but physical stimulation can arouse them. And often, for aces who engage in sex, it's about the intimacy of being with their partner rather than the act of sex itself.    How often an ace will engage in sex with their partner depends on the couple. Some do it once or twice a month. Others a few times  year. Or whatever else they've agreed on before hand. It's about making sure both people are happy, non-coercive and consenting.  Still, there are coupled aces who don't engage in any sex at all because their partner is understanding and they have an agreement.  Sometimes, aces who are partnered with an allosexual will have an open relationship so that the allosexual can have sex.   Take a look at these. It might clear up many of your misconceptions."

bisexual,37e27c,seirianstar,2,Wed May 27 02:11:46 2015 UTC,"Do you find yourself turned on by someone(you see a part of their body and think you wanna bone) after making an emotional connection with them? If so, then demisexal most likely works.  If you never find yourself turned on by anyone, then maybe you're a bi-romantic ace? With aces, the hardware still works and manual stimulation can cause arousal. Arousal is not the same as sexual attraction. Sexual attraction is when you look at someone and get turned on by their body.  Asexuals and demisexuals can enjoy sex. It's the sexual attraction that makes a difference between one or the other."

You might adopt demisexual, sapiosexual, grey-ace, or any number of ace spectrum subcategories if you're wanting to be hyper-specific about how attraction happens for you - and I personally do this, if specificity is what I'm shooting for - but due to the way these spectra are still covered by their own umbrella terms, it's just as appropriate to call myself - and yourself, if you choose - a bi ace."

Also, I'm not sure if we should be giving the Star any credit for being progressive. That's probably not the case. Brad Pitt is probably the most popular actor alive. Women love him.

The idea of supporting a tabloid publication for innuendos and continuing a witch hunt of non-hetero men in attempts to shame or ridicule them; just makes me cringe.  I agree w the premise that the youtube narrator had, that in the US: Dollars speak louder than voices.  However, there has to be a floor...or a proverbial line that is not crossed based on ethics & morals.  The sad reality is that, far too many lives are adversely affected when people are outed by snitches & gossipers before they are ready to share themselves to their inner circle.    Coming out is a pivotal transformational point for many LGBT members; an event that they will remember for the rest of their lives.  And that returns me to my angst of the request beings asked of us here...  Asking the bisexual community to champion a tabloid that further perpetuates the narrative of the furtive promiscuous bisexual phrased in the pejorative fashion they have  - simply because it acknowledges our existence - seems like we're grasping at straws.  I would like to believe we're better than that.  I might be wrong...but that's my hope that we are, indeed, better than that.  That's my 2¢"

No spontaneous pillaging? :O   Also I thought transgender people snuck into bathrooms and made it their den of sin?   No, no, you see what we do is this: We choose a bar, either a gay bar or a straight bar depending upon our flavour of pray that night. We pick up someone by constantly making reference to the genitals we don't have, and how perfect these nonexistent genitals are, and how much that person will like them.  Then we bring them to a seedy motel, and tie them to a bed. We rip off our pants or skirt and go ""SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!!!"", while uploading photos to their facebook page.  If it's a trans woman, she's obligated to find a heterosexual man and FUCK HIM RIGHT IN THE ASS.  I am obligated as a trans man to shove my cunt into unsuspecting people's faces and demand they eat me out while screaming ""I BET YOU WISH THIS WAS A PENIS DON'T YOU!?!?""  With this, we retain our valued status as human predators.   I'm confused on who does the baby eating between us two. Can we get a professional in here?   And then we go eat a baby."

The risks of contracting hiv from oral are basically impossible, but much more likely from unprotected anal. Also, you should use a condom if possible with oral, but the risks associated are much higher if you do anal without a condom.   Also, don't ever let anyone talk you into slipping it in without a condom because they are ""uncomfortable"" or they ""dont have any"". All of that is bullshit."

bisexual,379r9r,Mekaista,1 point,Tue May 26 11:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well now you start corrupting people, gathering power, and practicing rituals. As an undercover agent of the gay agenda you're required to turn 12 straight men gay a year. They count for extra if they're married. Remember your goal is to corrupt society and spread immorality and stuff. Also you'll want to learn to control your powers for evil. Practice your pentagrams and satanic runes. Don't forget that you'll need to acquire a steady supply of raw bismuth for material components. Lastly, learn how to control your form. Its a well known fact that bisexuals can turn into unicorns when threatened. This is your first line of defense.  /sarcasm  Okay serious face now. Just take a deep breath and try not to freak out. Its scary at first but its normal. You may want to lurk and absorb around here and lgbtq spaces online. You may also want to come out and talk to people. What you do is up to you, but I found telling a few close friends really helped me to accept that part of me. Everyone is different though. The most important thing is to just take it slow and accept that you haven't changed at all. It was always there, and you just noticed it for the first time."
bisexual,37a5ca,light_sky,5,Tue May 26 02:49:17 2015 UTC,"It does seem like your husband and you are not on the same page. It sounds like you're interested in getting some girl action, whereas your husband is interested in watching/""participating"" (at least as an observer, during a threesome--that's what seems to me meant by the ""not around"" comment; he doesn't want to interrupt the girl-on-girl fantasy, but he certainly wants to watch it) in your girl action. Now, your husband may perhaps also be perfectly happy with you having solo flings with women. But I don't think his comments about threesomes necessarily endorse that. There might be a difference for him in your relationships with women if he gets to be involved or if he is not a part of it. I think you should clarify this with him in order to be totally honest with him and his feelings."

bisexual,37a5ca,thlayli_x,2,Wed May 27 04:56:45 2015 UTC,"Non-monogamy for established couples works when both are complete honest and open, and there is a lot of sharing and communication.  That sharing might be a cam, or it might just be talking.    A lot of women are not interested in being shared, in real life or on cam, so you are more likely to have success alone.  But do tell your husband everything, including how much fun and pleasure you get from it; he might like that.  Are you giving him the same opportunity and freedom that he is willing to give you?"

bisexual,37a96w,flakaccount,7,Tue May 26 03:21:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like she is struggling with her sexuality.  Has she said that she is bi? As silly as this sounds a lot of bisexuals seem to forget that bisexuality exists and believe that they must be either straight or gay. If she has not specifically stated that she is bisexual you might want suggest that.   If I were you I'd give her some space tell her that you are there for her and can talk when she wants to talk. And you should tell her that you would want to be friends even if she isn't interested sexually.  We can't tell you if you have a chance because she could be a lesbian but want to please you, or she could be bisexual and simply not be confused and scared.   And a lot of bisexuals who are first coming to terms with their sexuality do fluctuate a lot, and that is what leads to a lot of confusion about their sexuality. I know when I first realized my attraction to men I thought I was gay for 2 weeks, and then I thought that I just had an off two weeks and was really straight, and then a while later it clicked that I was simply bisexual."
bisexual,37a96w,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,3,Tue May 26 05:41:36 2015 UTC,"She has called herself bisexual several times, and I'm certain she at least was attracted to me, and she had admitted such a few times.  I guess that's why I'm confused."
bisexual,37a96w,light_sky,3,Tue May 26 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"Do I have a chance? Do bisexuals fluctuate? What should I say to her if I think she wants me back?   I'll address these in order. You may ""have a chance"" in that she may be interested in guys. But her message implies that right now she's confused or questioning things and may need space, which may not bode well for a relationship right now. Many bisexuals can and do fluctuate in their preferences, but generally it's not so extreme that they suddenly break up with their partners (i.e., I'm currently dating a man, and sometimes my attraction to women will flare up more intensely, but that doesn't result in me wanting to break up with him). However, sexuality in general is also strange and fickle and surprising. Case in point: I once kissed a girl I really, really liked--and the second I kissed her I lost all attraction I'd ever harbored for her, a physical light switch being flipped off just like that, and I'll never understand how or why that happened. Not saying that's what's going on with your friend, just that sexuality can be like that. My advice is you follow your friend's lead on this: if it looks like she wants some space, give her space for a while; if it seems like she wants to talk about what's going on, be an open listener. If it turns out it was a weird fluke where she got nervous, but she still wants to be with you, well, then, it's your move. Good luck!"
bisexual,37a96w,Chris770,1 point,Tue May 26 05:04:17 2015 UTC,"What you're asking is impossible to answer without really knowing her well. We aren't exactly experts on each others' individual nature here, simply because bisexuality is very diverse in itself. Answering one of your questions is a good example of that. Some bisexual people fluctuate, either slightly or greatly. Some of us do not at all, or if we do it's very gradually over a very long space of time.  The only good advice here is pretty universal for a lot of things, be patient and offer to be non-judgmentally supportive with no personal expectations on your own behalf. You really can't go wrong there."

The only thing I can see being a negative is the potential for meeting someone with less than stellar motives, and that goes for anywhere.  Have fun!"
bisexual,3793vb,bicoastaltoo,4,Mon May 25 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"Saunas and gay bathhouses are easy places to say no to whatever is too far to go for you, and therefore great for experimenting.  You set your limits, others have to accept them.  Someone might act rejected if you won't go beyound your limits, but I've never know anyone to make a big issue out of it.    I would go to a sauna before I would go to a stranger's home.  Saunas/bath houses are public, although it is a select public in there.   Usually there are men that are willing just to kiss, caress, jack-off, etc.  Others want everything in the book; you choose what works for you.  And as /u/MileGateaux said, play safe."

His wife didn't know about that side of him. He ended up giving me my first ever blowjob.   Second time I went, I happened to be in the sauna when a guy came in and sat close to me. We didn't even talk really, but he reached over and started giving me a handjob. While doing that someone came in and started watching. It was a quite a thrill.   That second time I was there I did happen to also watch a threesome. Three guys just went for it and didn't care who was watching. That day I felt like I was in a porno movie.  I did enjoy these experiences but I never felt right about it. I think a lot of it had to do with feelings of guilt and shame (grew up in a family that thrived on guilt). I never went back."

Anyway, porn is just a fantasy tool, it's only slightly indicative of anything useful when trying to find yourself. There are straight guys who love gay porn, and gay women who love gay porn, and straight women who love lesbian porn, and gay guys who like lesbian porn.   Deal with your real life emotions and attractions, not necessarily what gets you hot and bothered with pornography."

I myself kinda denied my bisexuality in the beginning, but I've later come to accept it, so I doubt that's a reason for your habits. I guess we all just have our preferences when it comes to porn and kinks, so just watch whatever you feel turns you on, as long as it's not illegal. I wouldn't recommend you to watch anything illegal."

bisexual,378yx3,DelphFox,2,Tue May 26 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"It's pretty normal. I personally enjoy straight porn a lot more than I do gay porn, and I enjoy straight sex more than gay sex.   However, in my case, it's a bit of a 'grass is greener on the other side' kinda situation, as I'm in a relationship with another guy and have male FWB's to play with, and no women to explore the 'straight half' of my sexuality right now.  But the important part is that you like what you like, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a preference towards one or the other.   Nobody can judge you for what you're attracted to, so as long as you're honest with yourself and your partners about your desires, it's okay. Also, don't be too worried if your preferences change over time, or you find yourself more drawn towards one side or the other. It's normal to have sexual phases in which you are aroused more by gay or straight sex/porn than usual.   Sexuality is a spectrum, and bisexuals tend to wander all over it depending on their mood. :)"
bisexual,378yx3,rob22343,2,Tue May 26 00:43:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know if its just my preferences, but gay porn just doesn't tend to do it for me the same way lesbian porn and to a degree straight porn does. Its Almost as though gay porn just isn't as well made in general. There are some studios out there though that make excellent gay porn in my opinions, so they might be worth looking into before you write it off completely haha"
bisexual,378yx3,greenmusic44,2,Tue May 26 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"I've (M) done and thoroughly enjoyed IRL Male experiences before, but watch almost exclusively lesbian and straight blowjob porn. I still consider myself bi because even though I am heteroromantic I can appreciate the purely sexual appeal of males sometimes. I cannot say for sure what my split is but I primarily look at women from day to day... I've found that I tend to find males more attractive sexually mostly after I've had a bit of conversational interaction with them. With women I can have literally no idea what they are like as a person and still want to bang them on sight. Obviously with romance though I still want to get to know women, but getting to know men doesn't really incite a romantic attraction. I was actually 18 when I realized by bisexuality; almost 22 now. I still don't understand why gay sex is so enjoyable to me whereas gay porn does nothing. But, that's how it is and I still consider myself bi."

bisexual,378yx3,Chris770,1 point,Tue May 26 02:21:07 2015 UTC,"Porn preference doesn't necessarily match personal sexual preference man. Some exclusively gay guys only like watching straight porn, and there's actually one studio that's seriously and specifically capitalized off that. I'm not thinking this says anything in particular about you at all, other than what you like watching.  But, since it sounds like you're really curious about the why of it when it comes to yourself, you might ask yourself certain things. Self-exploration like that is pretty healthy. Is it like the (generally unimaginative) stuff that goes on in gay porn doesn't really match up with what you like to think about doing with other guys? (There's no right or wrong answer to this, nobody else has a right to tell you what you should or shouldn't like the idea of doing.) When you do run across guy-on-guy vids you find interesting, what's different? Is there some situation involved in them that you find especially appealing?"
bisexual,378yx3,Chris770,2,Tue May 26 08:29:02 2015 UTC,"I generally find more feminine looking guys attractive, and almost all gay porn videos I've seen are two (or more :p) huge hairy dudes, so I gues that might be it"
bisexual,378yx3,EngHardy,1 point,Tue May 26 11:05:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, I can see where that would be a problem. As much as being in touch with ones' ""femininity"" is a very commonly promoted ideal in gay culture, very little gay porn features feminine guys. It's a very interesting paradox, considering that masculinity can be looked down upon in that culture. There's a lot of variety in actors though, and ""hairy muscle dude"" porn is only one niche of that. Corbin Fisher is a studio which tends more toward actors our age who're more clean cut. Most of them are at least functionally bisexual (CF does gay, bi, and straight porn, and you can find the same actors in all three situations.) Anyhow, enjoy your self-exploration!"

bisexual,3783ax,Selkie_Song,40,Mon May 25 17:27:10 2015 UTC,"There are very feminine, small figured mousy trans girls, and there are lumberjack-looking trans men with well-kept beards, and there are tiny mousy trans girls with vaginas, and there are lumberjack trans men with penises.   There's nothing wrong with you if you don't find someone attractive and don't want to date them. But if they're right up your alley, and then you hear that they're trans and nope out, it's the fact that they're trans that you don't care for, not any trait of their bodies or personalities.   Does that make sense? If you never end up being attracted to a trans person, who gives a fuck? Just don't tell us ""oh, that can't happen because you're not real men and women and I don't swing that way."" That's insulting and unnecessary; you wouldn't be attracted to a tall, brash, broad-shouldered cis girl--I know quite a few--but you wouldn't need to treat her as a nonwoman to avoid dating her. You could just, you know, not be into her like you wouldn't be into any other woman.  I don't think that's unreasonable."
bisexual,3783ax,RevengeOfSalmacis,18,Mon May 25 18:06:59 2015 UTC,"So, am I being ridiculous, offensive, rude? Or are they just way too sensitive?   Honesty, it sounds like you just want us to confirm for you that this person is being way too sensitive.   I think that it's kind of offensive that you don't seem to consider the possibility that a trans man can be one of those ""lumberjack looking guys with well-kept beards or none at all"", or that a trans woman can be feminine, small-figured, and mousey; it assumes that we're all going to always look like the sex that we were assigned at birth, that there isn't as much human variation among trans people as there is among cis people.  There is nothing wrong with being attracted to specific bodies and gender expressions, but when you assume (and the way you phrased it, that's what it sounded like, regardless of how you meant it) that one group of people never fits into that specific type, then that's less okay."

I'm not trying to be a dick, I've just yet to see a convincing switch. I'm not attracted to either of those pictures as either gender."
bisexual,3783ax,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,1 point,Thu May 28 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"I've just yet to see a convincing switch   Not being attracted to those people is fine, but the fact that you think Buck Angel looks ""feminine"" is a little laughable. I notice you only focused on the ones you don't like. Are you trying to tell me that she is not a passable woman and is objectively beautiful, even if you don't personally find her attractive?  There's a difference between ""I'm not attracted"" and ""convincing switch"".  Here's the thing:  I think you're holding trans people to a higher standard than you are cis people. Period. The fact that you think for one second that you could peg someone as trans based on their features alone. If they had not told you that guy was trans, you never would have noticed. Buck Angel wouldn't even be a blip on your radar.  Cis women can be masculine looking.  Cis men can be feminine looking.  I would really sit back and re-evaluate exactly what it is that you're pegging on ""trans-ness""."
bisexual,3783ax,TheLonelySamurai,10,Thu May 28 23:02:22 2015 UTC,"To say that you are not attracted to any transgender people is wrong.  There are trans men who look like the muscular lumberjack that you described and there are trans women who are very small and petite.  If you say you are not attracted to most trans people that is fine, because most do not fit the type that you described. But to say you aren't attracted to any trans people is wrong because your argument about being picky physically is false as some trans people do fit the type.  If you say you won't date a trans person who does meet your physical requirements then you are being transphobic and it does say something about your character.  Honestly this is probably just a case of miscommunication and misinformation. What you are saying is the equivalent to a girl saying she wouldn't date black men because she doesn't want to date a guy with a huge penis. It is totally OK for her to say she doesn't want to date a guy with a huge penis but it is incorrect for her to assume that all black guys have huge dicks. You are assuming that all trans people look androgynous and therefore you aren't attracted to them. But the truth is that a lot look androgynous, but not all of them and it is wrong of you to discount them because of your stereotype that you don't realize is incorrect."
bisexual,3783ax,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,1 point,Mon May 25 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"most do not fit the type that you described   I want to point out, because while I agree completely with your comment, that this is wrong, at least in the way you worded it(which I don't think you did on purpose). You seem to have worded it almost like ""well most trans people don't fit this"", but I think a better way to word it is that most people don't fit this. Trans guys and trans gals have just as much going for us as our cis counterparts do in terms of physicality, height, musculature, etc. We're boringly normal once you humanize us, and we've got the same ratio as the general population of unattractive, average, and holy hell who is that they're so hot kinds of people. :)"
bisexual,3783ax,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Tue May 26 04:50:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say that less trans people fit those specific types of looks. Most trans men are shorter and most trans women are taller. This is just because they went through puberty as their birth gender.  But it's no different than when talking about a specific race. Most asians are shorter and most africans are taller. That doesn't mean that OP is not attracted to any Asian men or any African women, but it does imply he will be attracted to less of them than other races."
bisexual,3783ax,rotabagge,0,Tue May 26 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"That's actually never been proven. Think about the height variation you see in cis women, and now think about the height variation you see in cis men. I'm as tall as my father, who is actually shorter than my mother. It really, really is a crapshoot, and it's nothing you could make a sweeping generalization about and exclude an entire group from with any good conscience. Trans women are the same as well. I've got a trans girl friend who transitioned in her mid twenties, and she's 5'3'', just one inch shorter than I am. The thing is, when people make generalizations about trans people, they're usually doing it based on the people who don't pass. This is problematic for a lot of reasons, which I'm sure I don't have to list. But the reality is, the large majority of trans people do pass, and we end up being the silent majority while people base stereotypes of us on the visible minority.  Being in the trans community myself, I can't say I feel comfortable with the stereotype that most trans guys are short (again, it seems to be the visible minority) and most trans girls are tall. I would bet there are probably some interesting statistics there, once we gain proper human rights and researchers are free to study the population with a bit more leisure, but until then, personal experience has taught me this: Most of the stereotypes are just that, stereotypes."

NO ONE, regardless of whatever precious little adjectives they use to describe their body or their sexuality is entitled to have you find them attractive.  You are not obligated to consider anyone you're not interested in for WHATEVER reason you may have for not being interested in them.  It is fucking hilarious watching half the people in this sub suddenly turn 180° on the ideology they espouse to the ""normal"" world when it comes to legitimizing their sexuality, then attempt to tell you that you're wrong for doing the exact same thing.  The hypocrisy is positively violent.  And they don't even see it.  Which is why I personally think it's funny.  But, then again, I've got a pretty sick sense of humor."

The fact that you think everyone here is being two-faced tells me more about your own feelings towards transgender people than it does anything else. Who are you to police these other people's sexualities and assume things about them? Who are you to say that they're being facetious, and wouldn't date a trans person? Bisexual people have a damn high rate of acceptance of trans people, especially those of us who are non-op or pre-op. You are making absolutely no sense.  Not to mention many of the upvoted comments are by actual trans people, so are you accusing them of ""turning a 180""?"

(Emphasis mine).   I very clearly said ""half the people here.""  ""Well,"" I'm sure you're thinking, ""that's just nitpicking innit? "" Actually, no.  I think it's quite demonstrative of the general trans acceptance bludgeon that gets used so heavy handedly in subs like this.     tells me more about your own feelings toward transgender people than it does anything else   You mean, that they, more than anyone else these days it seems, vociferously, antagonisticly, and unilaterally demand that you be DELIGHTED by them lest they label you transphobic?  I don't think I'm hiding that from anyone.  But I'd like to think that I'm also doing a little bit to shed light on the hypocrisy behind the notion that the same damned group who is quicker on the draw with a ""phobia"" card than any other group I've seen in recent history is simultaneously so fast to deny others the right to follow their own path.  ""You have to love us the way we are!  But, please note, there's no way in hell that we're going to return the favor.""  Beyond that, who am I to police people?  Who the fuck are you to police me?  You clearly do not see the logical fallacies this entire line of arguments self destructs with.  AND THAT'S MY WHOLE POINT.  Demanding that people respect your preferences while you preach to them about how theirs are wrong is laughably stupid and cannot ultimately be sustained.    I'm also making no assumptions as to who here would date a trans person.  I don't care who anyone dates, but I at least am willing to respect their right to not be into whatever they're not into.   You are making absolutely no sense.   And that's where you're sadly mistaken.  Though, I can see why you'd prefer to sick your head in the sand and pretend that labeling people as transphobic because they aren't attracted to trans people is any different than labeling trans people as somehow ""wrong"" because they're trans.     Not to mention that many of the upvoted comments are by actual trans people, so are you accusing them of ""turning a 180?""   You mean those upvoted contents telling OP he's basically a horrible person for not being attracted to whoever he's not attracted to?  YES!  THAT IS THE EXACT 180 I'M TALKING ABOUT!  God forbid that someone try to tell a trans woman that they are misogynistic because they're not attracted to women, but make that someone who's not attracted to a trans person and suddenly they're trans phobic.  You cannot have it both ways.  Not if you want people to take you seriously."
bisexual,3783ax,TheLonelySamurai,-2,Tue May 26 13:50:47 2015 UTC,"So basically this is just a heaping post of transphobia. Seriously you sound like you frequent fatpeoplehate and have just decided to turn your ""interest"" onto trans issues.  Trans people are not DEMANDING shit except for basic human decency. You treat a post-op woman like you would an infertile cis woman, and a post-op trans man like an infertile cis man. You don't treat trans people as ""others"", and act like you'd need to be a statistical outlier to find them attractive. If a trans person doesn't have the anatomy you're into? Guess what? We all say ""move along!"", it's no sweat off anyone's back, and that's not being transphobic.  But the blatant othering going on here, in OPs post and in yours? That's transphobic, and I don't see how it could be anything but. If someone is perfect in every other way for you but you reject them solely based upon them being transgender? That is transphobia. Transphobia isn't solely ""Omg ewwwwww trans people!!""   God forbid that someone try to tell a trans woman that they are misogynistic because they're not attracted to women, but make that someone who's not attracted to a trans person and suddenly they're trans phobic.   ....What? How exactly is a straight trans woman misogynistic? Are all cis women inherently misogynistic? Seriously I have no idea what the hell you're even trying to say here, because you seem to be conflating gender identity with...sexual orientation? Or...I honestly don't know what you're saying."
bisexual,3783ax,JojoHendrix,1 point,Tue May 26 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"I never said I would absolutely reject someone because they were trans. If I met a guy, we hit it off, and he told me he was trans, I'd be fine with that. But I've never met or seen a trans man or woman that I've ever found attraction to. And it's not because they were born a certain gender, it's because there's always something about their facial structure that I'm not attracted to, and still wouldn't be even if they were CIS. I'm not saying they aren't attractive. I'm saying I'm not attracted. The same way I'm not attracted to short hair on girls, long hair on guys, a certain body weight (low AND high) Piercings, extreme hairstyles, backhair, boobs that are TOO big etc. etc. My bisexuality is SOLELY physical. I'm not looking to get romantically involved with another guy, and while personality CAN make or break who I hookup with, the physical aspect is still more important.  A dick or a vagina isn't enough to make me attracted to someone."
bisexual,3783ax,strombus_monster,1 point,Thu May 28 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"(Yeah, this definitely confused me, I thought you were the person I replied to for a minute.)  Okay, anyway:  See, what you're saying here is different from what you seemed to be saying in the OP. ""I haven't seen a trans person I'm attracted to before"" is different than ""I just don't find trans people attractive"". The first one doesn't assume anything about trans-ness, the second one does.  The whole ""facial features"" thing is presuming things. Trans people of either gender do not have a certain facial structure. The thing is, what you're most likely doing is judging trans people based on those who do not pass, while in reality most trans people pass just fine.  If you're trying to tell me Buck Angel here looks feminine, I don't know what to say.  Being trans is not the same thing as short hair, piercings, all that. There is the same variation in trans people as there are in cis people.  (Also... you're telling me that none of these people are attractive to you? At all?)  It sounds like your issue might be with presuming somehow that ""transgender"" automatically means you won't find these people attractive. The fact that you would be open to dating a trans person seems kind of at odds with what you're saying, so I think this is probably coming mainly from how you might subconsciously think trans people look, as evidenced by you mentioning things like facial structure (there is no dead giveaway to transness, it is heavily dependent upon the individual).  I think maybe just not using ""trans"" as a quantifier in attraction might be the best thing. It implies you're grouping people who have absolutely nothing in common besides a medical history and saying they're all the same. Even just a look at the guys and gals above should tell you how different the experience of being trans can be."
bisexual,3783ax,JojoHendrix,3,Thu May 28 22:50:56 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with not being attracted to a certain kind of person. You're not refusing to be around them at all because of who they are, right? You're just not attracted to them. It's perfectly normal to be unattracted to one of the two main genders, so why is it abnormal to not be attracted to someone else?

I didn't realize how it came across, and when you commented I realized how I sounded, so I tried to fix it. I didn't mean anything by it, I was trying to support OP. In a way, trans people are a mix, considering they tend to be one gender in another's body. And the way the world works these days, anyone who's not a straight male or female is technically othered, so yeah, that counts. I'm bi, and I consider myself othered as well, so don't get offended. I was just saying that people tend to think you can only be attracted to a male or a female, and that nobody else exists. But as soon as you mention being unattracted to someone who's not a male or female, everyone thinks you're a bigot and that you hate others and gets all pissy."

This is a reddit comment, I'm not lobbying to have you excommunicated for your opinion or anything.  The issue is that you see them as a ""mix"" of genders. That is what trans people are trying to fight not to be seen as. Admit it, when you think of a trans person the thing that immediately comes to mind is first and foremost ""chick with dick"", and if it's a day of the week where trans men even exist in the collective consciousness then you'll also tack on ""dude with vagina"". This isn't all trans people are, and in fact there is a huge community of fully post-op trans people. Those people cannot, in any stretch of the imagination, be a ""mix"" of genders.  That's the issue, people keep seeing them as ""a bit different"" or ""othered"", when language like that hurts trans people, no matter what the intention."

If you're still feeling some romantic inclinations towards the opposite sex, even if they're not sexual in nature, then you're still bisexual to some degree.  Most people aren't a perfect split between their differing sides.    Really, though, labels don't matter.  You don't have to spell out your sexuality for anyone but yourself, and you don't need a tag for that.  Be comfortable with what you want.  If you choose to say you're gay now it doesn't mean that something couldn't happen down the way to make you want to be with someone of the opposite gender.  Even if you pick a tag you don't have to stick to it forever.  Don't stress it.  :)"
bisexual,377xy1,weaversway,2,Mon May 25 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is why those who do serious work in the field of sexology no longer use the Kinsey Scale. It was revolutionary for its time, but it's now considered to be a very ""blunt instrument."" Metrics like the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid are more modern tools used now, and explain what you're describing a lot better by not trying to jam the different factors of a single person's sexuality together on a single scale."
bisexual,377xy1,Chris770,0,Tue May 26 08:35:38 2015 UTC,sofa-bed.  sigh.  google it.
bisexual,377uyz,ronnie1916,5,Mon May 25 16:27:10 2015 UTC,Bi doesn't necessarily mean you're only interested in cis men and cis women (although it does to some people). You can choose to keep using bi if you want. Or switch to pan/omni/poly/etc. Personally I use bisexual with people who aren't into queer issues because they understand the term and queer within queer communities because I don't see the point of something more specific.
bisexual,377uyz,ganderso,5,Mon May 25 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"Trans men are still men so you're still bi, pan is if you like anyone regardless of gender which includes gender queer/fluid people."
bisexual,377uyz,djb_thirteen,4,Mon May 25 17:43:37 2015 UTC,No. Bisexual can also apply to people attracted to those outside the gender binary. Bisexual is usually defined as 'sexually and romantically attracted to at least men and women'.  Words aren't tied to their etymological derivation.
bisexual,377uyz,weaversway,4,Mon May 25 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'd probably go pansexual if I were you, but if you're not into labels then I wouldn't worry about where you stand.  You don't need to fit into a nice little column on someone's data table.  Let yourself feel attraction as a natural extension of your personality and don't fret what to call it.  If someone else wants to know ""what"" you are, you could use either bi or pan without rocking any boats.  No one worth their salt is going to call you out on it.  It's your sexuality, you may define it as you wish."
bisexual,377uyz,light_sky,4,Mon May 25 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Having a relationship with a trans man doesn't make you not bisexual. ""Bisexual"" is my identifier of choice and I'm totally open to dating trans and non-binary people. Bi just means you are attracted to more than one gender."

For many, it just deals with a perspective that's, at least partially, outside their ability to identify with. This is just something to keep in mind, and be prepared for, should you decide to have a discussion with him about it."

bisexual,375aph,MlleGateaux,1 point,Mon May 25 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"Discovering your sexuality can be kind of exciting, and keeping it a secret can be almost painful at times.  You don't want to have to be secretive about an important part of who you are.  That said, at 14 you still have a lot of time to spend with your parents and if they take it badly it could make your life really difficult.  You have enough to worry about with school and figuring out who you want to be as a person.  I wouldn't add the stress of a possibly negative family reaction to that.    If you want to tell someone, tell a friend that you trust very dearly.  You could test the waters with your family, maybe tell them a kid you know at school came out as bisexual and see how they take that, but I would be very careful about it.    I'm 34 and I never bothered to come out to my immediate family.  I don't even think they'd care that much, but I just really didn't think it was any of their business."
bisexual,374br6,weaversway,9,Sun May 24 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to worry about finding a label for what you are sexually.  There is never a point where anyone is going to say, ""Decide now or it's over!""  Explore your desires yourself, think through the different parts of a relationship you might have with a female and ask yourself if they interest you in any compelling way, or if they're just a curiosity.  Maybe you just like the idea of a f/f sexual situation, but not necessary the actual act of being with a woman.  That's fine.  Maybe after thinking about it a while you'll want to actually try something more with female, and that's fine too.  Move at the pace you're comfortable, and don't be afraid to talk to the people you trust about things like this.    Your friend may have the same sort of curiosities and, if she's a good friend, even if she doesn't share the curiosities she should be willing to listen if you want to talk about things.    Just remember that it's alright not to know exactly what your sexual identity is at every single moment of your life.  There is always room for self-discovery and expansion of your horizons.  Think about what you want, and what makes you happy, and pursue that."
bisexual,374br6,hypnofed,3,Sun May 24 22:38:22 2015 UTC,"I came here to post pretty much this.  OP, one thing a lot of us do and tend to regret is that we focus too much on worrying what we are.  It doesn't matter what we are or what we call ourselves.  Maybe you're bi.  Maybe you aren't.  That's not the point.  The point is to focus on what makes you feel good and what makes you happy.  Once you understand that, labels follow.  But labels don't define you.  You define you."

Unfortunately there are a lot of biphobic people inside the LG world. And women like that usually are not willing to look deeper into their motives, they get all huffy with you 'don't you dare tell me who I should sleep with'. Sigh.  Oh and even better wsa the woman who told me that the thought of sex with a man was so distasteful that she could never be with a bisexual woman, and be fair, she said, it wouldn't be fair to that bisexual woman because she would never be able to talk about previous relationships with men.  And this came from a woman who had been married to a man and had kids with him. I get that you are so shocked to find out that the reason you are not attracted to your husband is because you like women better, but to go all the way to the other side and call sex with men distasteful and by proxy bisexuals too.... impossible attitudes to correct. I mean, I find the eating of liver and other internal organs, insects and blood sausage distasteful and rather not be present when you do that, but if you have done that in the past I really won't get upset with you talking about it."

If you do wish to come out, consider bringing it up at an appropriate time after acquainting yourself with others.  You will be surprised at how accepting college is of the LGBT.  There is the exception of religious, conservative schools that you may need to be more careful with who you open up to.  Even in those places, there are allies though.  You might be asking who these ""others"" may be this coming year and can say they will be great people.  Understand that everybody else is in the same boat, alone and trying find their niche.  This forces people to really engage with strangers, so do not worry about making friends.  If you are worrying about school work on the other hand, also do not worry.  The professors really ease you into the whole curriculum.  My biggest tip would be to get to know professors throughout your time in college, they will be invaluable later when it comes to jobs, graduate school, or just plain support.  Join clubs, talk with people in your dorm, and do not feel intimidated by others."

bisexual,37390r,Genopium,2,Sun May 24 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"This is mostly self-cut. I tied back a section to keep longer (like the man-bun thing) and buzzed down the sides and back. My hair has ridiculous amounts of volume, though, and doesn't like to stay how I want it. 90% of the time I'm wearing a beanie.  I need to get to a salon to get it properly trimmed up, but I'm lazy as fuck and all my hairstylist friends work too far away.  I usually just Google search images of sexy men's hairstyles."

bisexual,371ukh,ChromInSmash4,7,Sun May 24 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing about the, 'bi as a stepping stone to gay' trope is that our response can't be, 'it's a myth', because that's not true.  1) Yes, some people use bisexuality as a stepping stone to homosexuality. If they do it because they're confused, we're glad they are open minded.  2) If people do it to protect themselves, then we shouldn't begrudge them that any more than we begrudge people who closet themselves as straight. (E.g., not at all).  3) Factually, it's way less common than you think.  4) Even if it's super common, you should take someone's self defined sexual orientation at face value.  a) That's common courtesy. If someone introduces themselves as Daniel, you wouldn't say, ""No, I think you're more of a Ben, so I'll call you that."".  b) If they're actually attracted to men and women, you're being super biphobic.  c) If they're only attracted to the same gender, they're clearly lying for some reason, and I generally trust that someone wouldn't lie to me for no reason.  5) Because people are assholes, a number of people who are attracted to women and men closet themselves as gay. If you're skeptical of people who claim to be bisexual, it's unclear why you'd not be as skeptical of those who claim to be gay. Given that no-one actually is, you can safely conclude it's only biphobia that leads to the differential reaction."
bisexual,371ukh,djb_thirteen,2,Sun May 24 13:42:18 2015 UTC,"for some ""bi"" is a halfway house in terms of their openness, for others IT IS THE HOUSE.  or the sofa bed."
bisexual,371ukh,cripplesmith,1 point,Tue May 26 19:39:44 2015 UTC,God that thread is full of so much biphobia. I hate seeing how phobic the gay community can be sometimes. :( It reminds me exactly why bisexuality is its own unique community.
bisexual,371ukh,TheLonelySamurai,1 point,Mon May 25 05:12:41 2015 UTC,Where is the biphobia? I'm not really seeing anything too obvious. Can you give some examples?
bisexual,371ukh,Soundcentral,1 point,Mon May 25 15:05:08 2015 UTC,"For the most part it's not too obvious, but there are frequent insinuations that being bi is just ""easier"" and that being bisexual means the people around you will push you to be with a woman and...there were just a bunch of comments that kind of rubbed me the wrong way because they seemed to be insinuating that somehow bisexuals are ""more accepted""...I don't know, I could just be oversensitive tonight, who knows."
bisexual,371z7w,SleepNowMyThrowaway,4,Sun May 24 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on whether you're pre or post-op. If you're post, I'd say there probably won't be much difference. If you're pre-op, bi women are going to be more accepting because we like all sorts of genitalia and there are a lot of cis lesbians who exclusively enjoy vagina (although it's definitely not all).  Bi women do outnumber lesbians, but we are generally either mistaken for lesbians or straight women depending on the particular environment we're in at the time. Your best bet would probably be to seek out lesbian spaces because you'll find a lot of bi women there in lesbian camouflage. ;) Online dating will probably be a good bet too."
bisexual,371z7w,TheLonelySamurai,2,Sun May 24 17:48:48 2015 UTC,"Good points, I've been kinda poking around on r/actuallesbians and had the brainstorm to ask advice over here.  I'm non-op and likely to remain that way, so ... can you be a lesbian and be with a non-op trans woman? Probably?  These questions never seem to come up in Ann Landers.  Tried the online thing and got some nibbles, even sans photo, so once I start passing I'll have to make a better effort if I'm in the market.  Anywho, thanks for the help.  Oh - another question and I'll maybe make a separate post on this, but are non-op trans women sought after at all by bi women? Or not?   Kinda being a one stop shop so to speak, I'd think maybe?   I'm pretty ignorant of bisexual women, sorry :)"
bisexual,371z7w,TheLonelySamurai,3,Sun May 24 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm non-op and likely to remain that way, so ... can you be a lesbian and be with a non-op trans woman? Probably?   Yep! I lurk around r/actuallesbians too and there are plenty of lesbian couples including non-op trans women. It just seems that there are some lesbians who are primarily attracted to female gender (or feminine presentation and thinking) and then others who still consider trans women to be full women but are only attracted to women with vaginas. There is definitely a mix.   Oh - another question and I'll maybe make a separate post on this, but are non-op trans women sought after at all by bi women? Or not?   I don't know that I've ever heard of any bi women having a strong preference for pre-op trans women. It's just usually that we have the ability to fall in love with and be attracted to more than one gender and are open to that happening. Some bi women are only attracted to people who are very close to binaries and some are attracted to everyone in between or some other variation. Most women who know they are attracted to people throughout the gender spectrum identify as pansexual. If you present somewhere closer to the middle in terms of binaries, it might be helpful to look for someone with that orientation. :) Personally, I didn't come to terms with being bi until after I married a guy. I've never fallen in love with or had a crush on a trans person (that I know of), but if, heaven forbid, something happened to my husband, I would be definitely open to that happening. Whether or not it would is a whole other question. Since it hasn't yet, I just identify as bisexual, and from my interactions with other bi people that seems to be a pretty common stance.  I hope this helps! Good luck! :)"

bisexual,371z7w,Steve_the_Scout,3,Mon May 25 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"Oh - another question and I'll maybe make a separate post on this, but are non-op trans women sought after at all by bi women? Or not?    Okay, first off, ignore RJany, please.  Now, I'm a bisexual trans guy, so I can't answer this question from a female POV, but I have been around people who think this way.  In short: Yes, there are women who seek out non-op trans women. The biggest thing would be this: Are you okay with possibly using your parts to penetrate? There are some women who crave occasional penetration, but want to be in a lesbian relationship. You would have to set your limits and speak to them about what your sex life would look like, just like you would with anyone else. :)  Every one of the women I've met that specifically seek out trans women of the non-op variety have been incredibly sweet, unassuming, educated on trans issues, accepting, and they're basically everything that the male gender who specifically seek out trans women aren't. You'll have to figure out your own comfort level with what these women might want sexually, and you'll have to decide if you're okay with them finding trans women's bodies particularly sexy. (I've dated a few trans boy chasers of the male persuasion, and they're generally cool people. I think it's mostly the guys attracted to trans women that ever seem to have an entitled attitude issue going on. Obviously not all of them, but...a lot.)  There are women out there attracted to trans ladies though, and that's really the bottom line. If you've got any questions about them, just ask me. :) One of my good friends is what you could consider ""trans attracted"", and she's always online so I can ask her questions you might have and get back to you."
bisexual,371z7w,El_Oso_Blanco,3,Mon May 25 05:31:30 2015 UTC,"Are you okay with possibly using your parts to penetrate?   Absolutely.   One of my good friends is what you could consider ""trans attracted"", and she's always online so I can ask her questions you might have and get back to you.   I'll do so, thanks :)"
bisexual,371z7w,RJany,2,Mon May 25 05:41:51 2015 UTC,"Since the answer is 'absolutely', I definitely think you will find ladies who enjoy that! (You could find ladies who don't enjoy it as well, just noting, but I'm trying to concentrate on what it sounds like you want versus what you don't.) Dating in bisexual circles might be a good idea. :)   I'll do so, thanks :)   No problem! If you ever want to PM me questions go right ahead, and I'll forward them on to her to answer."
bisexual,371z7w,TheLonelySamurai,7,Mon May 25 05:57:05 2015 UTC,I'd say bi women since they're more likely to consider pansexuality and be open-minded. But of course that's a generalization; everyone'a different.  Just be open and brutally honest. It's always the best way in the end.
bisexual,371z7w,RJany,5,Sun May 24 03:48:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm quite honest at the introduction, if a little sheepish."
bisexual,371z7w,TheLonelySamurai,3,Sun May 24 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"For all three of your main questions, you'd go with bisexual people (well, bisexual women). Although we only have a slight majority (1.8% of the general population v.s. 1.7% for gay and lesbian combined), and maybe would be a little less keen on outing ourselves unless it's relevant (although as long as you ask more or less plainly you'd be fine)."
bisexual,371z7w,RJany,6,Sun May 24 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"Well we might be a little biased, but I would say bi women. From what I've heard and noticed from the lesbian community's attitude towards bisexuals, I can't imagine they'd act any differently about trans.  That said, of course you can't really generalize this. It majorly is a person-to-person thing."
bisexual,371z7w,TheLonelySamurai,2,Sun May 24 18:33:58 2015 UTC,Probably bisexual women.   I think bi people are generally going to have a more fluid view of sexuality and gender.
bisexual,371ep4,DrTankHead,3,Sat May 23 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"Only come out if you want to. There is no rush in doing it. I think it's a good idea to talk to your sister. You can get her point of view, ask her how your parents reacted to it and such so you can get an idea of how it might go for you!   I allllmost told my mom the other day but the chance came and went. I know she'll be accepting but I also know it'll be confusing to her because I'm a bi-romantic ace. Her niece actually came out to her and it went great within the last few years. I'm just not sure how the conversation will go because I'll also have to talk about asexuality and sex(or lack thereof) and that's always kind of a weird subject to talk about with parents, for me anyway.   I've sent her articles here and there about aces, how a sexual culture affects asexual Hispanic women, bisexual jokes, lgtbqia issues, things like that. So, I know it won't be a complete shock when we eventually talk about it. I'm almost 30 btw. It took me quite some time to figure out who I am and I still don't have everything totally figured out yet. You're ahead of me by a longshot!  Also, if your sexuality changes later on in life, that's ok. It seems to be a pretty fluid thing!"
bisexual,371ep4,seirianstar,3,Sun May 24 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"Is there any particular reason you are choosing now to come out? For example, are you wanting to introduce a same-sex partner to them? I still have yet to come out to my family at 25 years old primarily because I never really needed to. But if you have a particular reason it would be good to emphasize the reason you feel like they should know. It would make them feel involved in your life and in your decision.  I would ask your sister what she may have done differently, or would do again if she had to go through the experience all over.   Remember bisexuality can be harder for some people to understand than homosexuality so welcome questions too.  Good luck :)"

bisexual,36zxeb,AmyinIndiana,20,Sat May 23 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"Just a note: not having experience with either gender doesn't mean he doesn't feel the attraction. It might have seemed like nice advice, but sometimes telling people they don't know because they haven't tried does more to negate their autonomy and hard-found identity.   He should feel free to come out to anyone, given he is in a safe place and  won't be harmed by admitting it.   Either way, looks like you're doing a nice job being supportive. Best of luck!"
bisexual,36zxeb,dontforgethetrailmix,11,Sat May 23 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"There was more to that bit that I didn't include - apparently a friend of his who has self-described ""gaydar"" told this young man that he picks up that he's either ""bi or pan"" - and that was what led him to examine his past relationships and start thinking that he might be.  I told him that before he tells his folks, he wants to be sure, because of their religious beliefs.  I also told him to be careful not to let anyone else define him.  I said something like, ""YOU get to decide who you are, not this person who suggested it to you.""  I hope that makes more sense."
bisexual,36zxeb,hattrickk15,4,Sat May 23 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the same thing as the poster above but with your clarification the advice you gave makes perfect sense.   There tends to be a romanticism in the LGBT sphere (and out of the sphere too) about coming out so I think you did the right thing by telling him to wait. With coming out, as with most things in life, it's about safety first. If you're still dependent on your parents and aren't sure of their reaction it's advisable to wait until you're in a position where you can support yourself or at least have a plan to survive if things go really bad. And it's perfectly acceptable for him not to be sure of his sexuality and to change his mind later on. He doesn't have to make a final decision about his sexuality until he feels sure. I think you've taken all the appropriate steps for this situation and I hope things turn out well.   Edit: Sending him to a GSA or a LGBT community center is great. If you're able to give him the number of someone you trust personally it may help him to open up better to them."
bisexual,36zxeb,colonelmcseabiscuit,7,Sun May 24 00:47:42 2015 UTC,I think that taking him somewhere to talk with adults who might understand what he's dealing with is a wonderful idea :)
bisexual,36zxeb,imnogoodatthisorthat,4,Sat May 23 18:08:26 2015 UTC,Getting him into a situation where he can talk with like minded individuals and find support is absolutely crucial. Point him to reddit. Find support groups. Anything you can think of to get him in front of people who will support him. Never stop being there and letting him know his feelings are REAL and should be validated. So many bisexuals ignore their other side because they just feel it isn't worth the drama it would cause. I'm one of those people and I wish I'd had more support in my youth. I adore the life I have but I wish that if had more exploration and exposure to my other side.
bisexual,36zxeb,imnogoodatthisorthat,4,Sat May 23 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"I asked a dear friend of mine, who used to be the president of our local pride, to get me the name of the Gay Straight Alliance sponsor at the school, so I can suggest that he talk to that person.    I worry that his internet access is monitored. If his parents find him reading about bisexuality online they might hit the ceiling before he's ready. That would be a terrible way for them to find out.  I didn't mention that I also offered to be there if/when he tells his folks. (It was a 2 hour conversation - I had to TL;dr myself!)"

I have to admit, it was about the LAST thing I expected him to tell me. I figured he was upset about his mom's pregnancy."
bisexual,36zxeb,esperandopara,3,Sat May 23 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"Some people would say, if possible, do NOT come out to your parents while you still depend on them. If they are paying for a roof over your head and food in your belly or a college education, as far as they need to know you are straight. If you find out you aren't at a young age it can be hard to keep it secret for too long. I was forced to come out to my fourth generation Texan, devout Christian, sixty year old dad, and my traditional Catholic mom a week ago. It went surprisingly well. You never know how they'll react, but in this case it doesn't look good. If possible keep it under the hat for as long as possible, but if he's only 14 that's at least four years of hiding in the closet. This is never easy, if he does come out you should count on either taking him in or rescuing him from that hostile environment"
bisexual,36zxeb,zack822,2,Sat May 23 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"I did suggest that to him - advice that I've heard Dan Savage give over the years, and it makes sense. If your parents are going to hold your future hostage to their own religious beliefs, then that's what they get.  I think a lot of the heart of his behavior problems the last few weeks has been that he thinks, ""if they knew they'd hate me..."" so he's basically acting out against them for something they haven't done yet, if that makes sense. We talked about that, and I'm hoping that he'll get in less trouble at home as a result of addressing it head on."
bisexual,36zxeb,jdlashley,2,Sat May 23 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"they'll probably say, ""you can be attracted to men, just don't act on it."" They also think God calls gay people to be celibate.    You might want to share this with his parents.  A lot of Christians think that they're ""sharing the truth in love"" with this ""being gay isn't a sin, having gay sex is a sin"" rhetoric, but the psychological consequences of telling a young child that they have to be alone for life can be deadly."

I have too much anxiety about what can go wrong with random men. I WISH I could just pick guys up like that sometimes.   As for your question, if what you want is quick gratification, then it's okay to go get it, in my opinion! When you find someone you want to be different with, you'll be different."

Don't be afraid to try new things (everyone is new to something). A fantasy is just a thought not made into reality. The goal is to make it a reality if you want. Is it judgement that you fear?

bisexual,370jqc,Ilovehoneebee,2,Sat May 23 19:57:36 2015 UTC,I do think your past experiences are a BIG factor. For example my first sexual experiences were with females. When I'm with a guy (my guy) I feel like I'm missing what's supposed to be there a woman not a man. My first experiences make me feel like that's what I want and what I'm doing now (being engaged to a man) is a silly joke I'm playing on myself.

The first time I hooked up after we were together was with a long time friend that we both knew. She asked all the standard questions...what did you do, was it good..etc.  That night she admitted she pictured it in her head and found it hot, the same way a straight guy might find Lesbians hot.

bisexual,370vxe,Drake5271,5,Sat May 23 20:45:08 2015 UTC,I suggest you give him a ultimatum. You or his ex... You should not have to deal with that kind of stuff...
bisexual,370vxe,DrTankHead,3,Sat May 23 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of emotion and thoughts that you have expressed.  It is a lot for anyone to process, most importantly because it is your life.   I'm confused about what you want here. Do you want a monogamous relationship? Are you hurting because you thought the relationship would be about more than sex and that y'all would be committed to each other, but he seems so unable to keep it in his pants?   You say ""I figured I needed something to put my dick in on leave, but I was really just looking for an excuse to stay with him.""  At least from how it's written, you seem to care about him as a person beyond just someone to have sex with.   Look, quite frankly, he doesn't seem ready to be in a committed relationship because he has demonstrated that he won't or can't. The 2 of you might be better parting ways.  I am concerned about some of the rage you're feeling. Specifically telling John to kill himself. I know you're angry, and hurt, and I understand why you would lash out, but regardless, it is a step too far. He is still a person, and many many people in the LGBT community are already struggling with issues like that.   No one likes feeling like they are being played. Or that other people are screwing up their lives, or feeling like its' out of their control.  I'm not defending John, but it also needs to be said, that you can get PTSD from any event that you experience as traumatic, even if the event wouldn't seem traumatic from outside. Many people with PTSD struggle because people think it's only something you can get in a war zone or from a car wreck or something.  You need to understand that you control your life. You don't control your boyfriend's or John's. You are staying with him because you choose to stay with him. Your boyfriend is choosing to sleep with John, because he is choosing that too. John is choosing to be an asshole to you.  I understand that you care about him, but when is it too much? At what point would you leave him?   You are letting these peoples' shit take you to a very dark place. We all have our own shit to deal with, and I have a limit on how much of other peoples' shit I can tolerate. This would be way over my personal tolerance level, and I expect that it is for you as well.  You can't control what other people think. You never will. You can only live your life the best you know how. Do that, and if you evaluate that the relationship is dragging you into being a worse version of yourself, then you should leave."

Before I dated him I dated a girl and cheated on her and told her right after it happened and said I'd understand if she wanted to break up. He came to me almost immediately which redeems him a bit, and I know after I cheated with my ex I felt horrible. Idk, I still want to make it work, he's so sweet, and we mesh so perfectly sexually, its just my trust in him took a big hit."
bisexual,370vxe,EVILGR33NRNGR,1 point,Sun May 24 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ok so break up with him and just keep fuckin but use condoms, he is clearly down with that shit. Cuz dude you are totally fooling yourself if you really think he is gonna stop cheating on you any time soon lol."
bisexual,36y88q,zachleez,32,Sat May 23 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"So, just, couple of things.  When you say you are gay, you know you are, and so on, because you've been with 2 guys, that doesn't mean anything. It just means you like guys.  Gay, bi, straight, it's all just broad labels. Those aren't that important.  She messaged me you on Tinder? She's probably somewhat interested. Just talk to her, let her know you're interested. If conversation falls on sexual orientation, maybe say something like ""I'd call myself gay, but every now and then I see girls that are just... wow, you know?"" or something to that effect."
bisexual,36y88q,VDRawr,9,Sat May 23 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you want to date the girl, then date the girl! Don't worry too much about what to say, no one really knows what to say on a first date anyway. Have fun."
bisexual,36y88q,jdlashley,7,Sat May 23 04:47:48 2015 UTC,There are really 4 types of attraction:  -Aesthetic (Pleasing to look at but lack of interest in having sex with etc.)  -Romantic (You want to date them and be in a relationship with them)  -Sensual (Similar to sexual but kind of scaled down a notch in that you kind of only want to do hugs and kisses but nothing more intimate than that (sex))  -Sexual (You want to have sex with them etc.)  So it is likely that you are a Biromantic Homosexual meaning that you feel romantic attraction to both genders (thus wanting to date both of them) but only sexual attraction towards the same sex (aka you want to sleep with them).
bisexual,36y88q,MelianErios,2,Sat May 23 05:45:46 2015 UTC,"No, aesthetic is not self explanatory. I'd think it's the same as sexual attraction. Could you evaluate... on both please?"
bisexual,36y88q,PoseidonOfTheSea,8,Sat May 23 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"I've always explained it as: You can admire the Mona Lisa as a work of art, but you don't want to bang the Mona Lisa."

bisexual,36y88q,hogglethebear,3,Sat May 23 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I guess I shouldn't have assumed it was easy to figure out :/  Okay, imagine you're looking at some really nice scene or picture or something that you find appealing to look at. You like to look at it but you don't really want to have sex with it. It's like there may be a really good picture of a waterfall or something but you don't want to have sex with a waterfall do you?"

bisexual,36y88q,PoseidonOfTheSea,2,Sat May 23 09:09:43 2015 UTC,"In the context of other people, if I was to look at a girl and think ""my god she's gorgeous, I'd love to do sexy things with her"" then that would be sexual attraction, but aesthetic attraction would be looking at that girl and thinking ""wow she's really really pretty and I really like looking at her""  Sexual and aesthetic are often pretty closely linked because I imagine most people wouldn't be interested in sexual activity with somebody they didn't also find aesthetically pleasing."
bisexual,36y88q,orcawhales_and_owls,1 point,Sat May 23 10:54:44 2015 UTC,I personally don't experience either sexual or aesthetic attraction and find both concepts really strange.
bisexual,36y88q,MelianErios,1 point,Sat May 23 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's pretty weird to grasp if you can't relate. Personally I have pretty much no aesthetic attraction to men, which made my teenage years and sexuality confusion waaaay more complicated :P  Out of curiosity though, you never look at somebody and think they look really nice? I know it's totally possible but the idea of not thinking ""oh wow that girl is super pretty"" in a totally non-attracted-to-her way seems really strange to me. I guess it shouldn't though because I feel that way about guys but I guess i never considered that some people may feel that way about more than just one gender."
bisexual,36y88q,orcawhales_and_owls,1 point,Sat May 23 13:55:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's such a weird concept to me... Like my friends (of any gender or sex) have opinions on as to whether someone (again of any gender or sex) is aesthetically pleasing aka ""pretty"" but I just don't understand it... I don't feel anything of the sort, it's weird, I don't understand how someone can be classed as pretty either if it is a completely subjective matter too.  That said it gets even more weird once you consider the fact that I haven't ever really felt anything to be aesthetically pleasing, including like paintings and natural stuff."

bisexual,36xo4n,rosecoloredswan,11,Sat May 23 19:45:46 2015 UTC,"If you are interested in a lesbian's opinion: I'm not even attracted to men and it took a while for me to get used to the idea of having a life-long same-sex relationship, and to accept the idea of not eventually marrying a man. So, no, I do not think this necessarily means that you are on the more straight side of the scale.  Although, if later on, you do decide that you'd rather end up with a guy over a woman, don't let anyone shame you for that, either. However you feel is okay. Just saying that this in itself shouldn't indicate to you that you ""should end up with a guy"". It just sounds to me like some of the ingrained thought patterns you have, have not yet caught up to your realization of your bisexuality."
bisexual,36xo4n,theendofstuff,3,Sat May 23 03:35:46 2015 UTC,Definitely - thank you for sharing. That helps a lot.
bisexual,36xo4n,Drake5271,8,Sat May 23 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"I used to have that 'hetero image' in my head, where I could see myself dating women, but ultimately marrying a man. I think, at least for me it was totally just me not coming to terms with my sexuality yet (not that I'm saying that's what's happening here, just my experience)--a vestige of cultural heteronormativity. At any rate, I eventually just grew out of it, and I can fully see myself marrying either a man or woman.   I don't think it indicates much about where you fall on the kinsey scale; I wouldn't worry about it. If you're happy with your girlfriend, then be happy with your girlfriend. :)"

bisexual,36xo4n,PoseidonOfTheSea,7,Sat May 23 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"No need to rush things. Stay with your girlfriend, sure you have have a slight preference for men, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't marry a woman. I'm in a gay relationship, and I recently came out as bi, we've been dating for so months and I still sometimes feel weird when my bf snuggles up to me in public or kisses me. I pretended to be straight for so long, it feels weird to have the cutest little twink around hanging off me, but I'll get over it, and so will you, I bet"

bisexual,36xo4n,CharlotteCorday_,5,Sat May 23 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"IMHO it kind of sounds like you're mourning the kind of life you thought you'd have (and the one society expects). This seems perfectly natural to me, and I would encourage you to feel your feelings about it, and also keep in mind that letting go of the expectation that your life is going to look like one thing or another will make your life better and open yourself up to so many amazing experiences (including being in an awesome relationship with a lady, which it sounds like you are!)"
bisexual,36xo4n,hattrickk15,1 point,Sat May 23 05:26:42 2015 UTC,Thank you. You're totally right!
bisexual,36yp1u,throwlesbian01,3,Sat May 23 06:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the reason she doesn't want to tell you is because you've shown signs of being worried over some of the details? Well, either way it's her business, but I hope she does open up about it sometime. It's good for partners to know each other's history, to a point.   When she says she has a different way of liking women, I think that just means that men and women are different kinds of people in her mind. I myself feel like a teenager with guys because I just haven't had that much experience there. Gender is weird.   Plenty of people in this sub have posted stories of telling their partner and they were really supportive, or broke up with them, or had a lot of questions, or didn't want to hear it. It's like rolling the dice.   Advice: Tell her you're happy she told you and that it would be cool to hear more if she wants to tell you. And then if she does tell you more, remember she's your partner today and you don't need to be afraid of her past. As with all things, the more you learn the less you will fear."
bisexual,36yp1u,aoeui-dhtns,7,Sat May 23 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear: telling someone you are bi and them being like 'oh that's hot tell me about your lesbian experiences' is not what most people want to hear, probably your wife included.   Imagine a lesbian friend came out to you. Would you find it acceptable to ask them about their pay sex life, or would that be disrespectful? The same applies to your wife. She is trying to tell you something important about herself and you are not taking it seriously. If she is telling you it probably means she was hoping for support from you and someone to talk to about her feelings.   Stop asking her about her experiences. If she wants to, she will tell you. Instead be interested in what she does want to tell you, there is almost certainly a reason she decided to tell you.   Edit: the friend thing. I have a friend like this. When I was figuring out my sexuality I had a massive crush on her, because I wasn't actively looking at girls and she was someone I was close to and cared about as a friend. It's a pretty common thing that happens to gay and bi people figuring themselves out, because they don't yet think to look for partners of the same sex. Now I have found someone who is actually right for me and got more comfortable with my tastes, it is pretty clear I am not interested in her any more in that way. We are still friends and I love her as a friend. She is in no way a threat to my relationship with my bf."

bisexual,36z2jj,15Throwawayyy15,15,Sat May 23 09:39:24 2015 UTC,"EVERYONE is trouble at your age.  Your guy friend is trouble because he gossips, and your other friends are trouble because they repeat a prejudiced party line.  Interpersonal drama is essentially the hallmark of people your age.  As ALL of you mature and develop more relationship experience, you will all be less ""trouble"" than you are now.  If you like her, ask her out.  Your friends' opinions don't have any basis in reality - bisexual women are not ""trouble"".  We're just people like everyone else.  As you mature yourself, you will learn not to choose partners by polling your friends first.  Be a man.  Date who you want to."
bisexual,36z2jj,MlleGateaux,2,Sat May 23 10:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get what you mean. We get along great and she's cute and the flirting was definitely not one sided, but my friends have already started with the bullshit jokes, like 'Is she out looking for carpets yet, or do we have to wait a little more?' and shit like that. I think it's envy up to a point, since they wouldn't dream of even getting to this point with a girl like her (hehe), but this got me thinking. I'm an lgbt ally, but I've never actually had to deal with it in a relationship."

bisexual,36z2jj,daturainoxia,-7,Sat May 23 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"It's a blow to my masculinity, I guess. It comes from the same place as the 'one penis policy'. I know it's not good, but it's definitely there."

bisexual,36z2jj,daturainoxia,-1,Sat May 23 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"Ehh, yeah, internalized sexism is a bitch. I've always been subconsciously afraid of appearing 'feminine' or stuff like that, and my friends do use gay slurs from time to time. There's a lot of stuff I need to change and I agree. You have to understand, though, that at this age a group of guys hanging out tends to be a hypermasculine environment."
bisexual,36z2jj,daturainoxia,1 point,Sat May 23 11:02:32 2015 UTC,I'm 23 and I'm bisexual. My bf and I are coming up on two years together. With no issue. Just bc she's bi doesn't mean she's anything other than a loyal and wonderful person.  As for your masculinity that's just societies bullshit telling you that women are less than men.
bisexual,36z2jj,Embarrassinghuman,4,Thu May 28 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"Well, now you've felt a touch of the discrimination that is heaved in the direction bisexual people.  You really need to tell your friends to STFU.  Are you strong enough to call them out on their homophobic comments?  Are you strong enough to reverse the flow of the peer pressure so your friends feel pressure to be more tolerant, compassionate and open-minded?"
bisexual,36z2jj,daturainoxia,8,Sat May 23 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"Sooooo are you really looking for advice? Or just venting? Because it's not worth our time if you are just going to stay close minded and have a retort for every suggestion.   If you want to know an actual real-life scenario that happened, I had a drunken fling with a girl but wasn't dating anyone at the time- ended up dating my room mate a bit later after that, but ended up dumping him and marrying the guy he introduced me to at a party.   My orientation had nothing to do with it- if you find someone better suited for you, you end up gravitating towards that individual. Period.   *edit-words"

You're 20, and at that age we usually still have some excess hormones bouncing around in our heads, and that can do all sorts of entertaining things like what you're describing. Give yourself some time and stuff will probably seem a lot less chaotic once the whole chemistry part evens out."

bisexual,36xurq,throwaway-717,1 point,Sat May 23 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"You know, idk if this is the issue, but I find that I do overthink things. I used to worry because virtually all of my fantasies were about men. But then, if I just focused on a woman's body, I got erect. Like push all the other stuff out. And then I had sex with HER. And I enjoyed it. Then I had to admit to myself that my sexual orientation wasn't necessarily based on who I fantasized about most, it was a factor, but not the only factor.  Let your body do the talking sometimes, is what I'm saying."

bisexual,36xdh6,throwaway727870,1 point,Fri May 22 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is fear of the unknown, I just don't have the experience to know for sure. I can't say in particular what it is that bothers me, just the idea that if I find a boyfriend and it becomes permanent that means I'll never have a girlfriend. Thinking about the reverse scenario doesn't affect me in the same way, just the fact that I won't get to have gay sex anymore."
bisexual,36xdh6,throwaway-717,1 point,Fri May 22 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"Brother, I am working on a lot of the same emotions you're feeling. I know a few things. One is that we don't really know what exactly sexuality is. Like what makes some people gay, straight or anything. So, all we have to go on are the subjective experiences and identities of people. So, for me at least, I had to recognize that my ""label"" is really a best guess, and that's ok.  Secondly, I know that this is a part of the larger fabric of who I am as a person, you know. It's not going to make or break me as a person.   I know that as my wife and I have climbed in income, I find myself pursuing ""symbols"" of status. Like we go to nicer stores and spend more money on things, I think, because I want to ""prove"" to myself that I have arrived. It doesn't make logical sense, but it's hard to shake, and I honestly think a part of my anxiety about all this is that what I wanted for so long is impossible.  My thinking is that, maybe for me at least, these thoughts are more symbolic, and not set in stone? Maybe if I can get it into my head that I don't need these symbols, then I can be free from them? Again, it's hard. I don't know this is even close to a solution or an answer to your question, but it's as far as I've gotten so far."
bisexual,36xdh6,throwaway-717,2,Sat May 23 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is a status symbol, I've wanted a girlfriend since I was a kid watching Disney movies where the guy always gets the girl. I think I've been programmed.  Even gay guys I know have all been with women before they officially came out. I can't shake the feeling that my experience needs to be the same if I'm ever to settle down with a guy.  All of this is thinking too far ahead for me, but I'm 27 and a late bloomer when it comes to sex and relationships. I've had to much alone time to think about it. :("

I totally understand that lesbians (and bi women) experience actually straight women just messing with them, but I wish we could all find a better way to talk about it.
