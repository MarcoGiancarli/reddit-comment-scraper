FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,joe-trohman-is-lame,12,Tue Jul 21 21:26:26 2015 UTC,It's Patrick's laugh. He's talked about it a few times. He couldn't get through the line without laughing so they decided to keep it.
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,pixees,9,Tue Jul 21 22:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah that is Patrick laughing in Young Volcanoes. I remember reading an interview back in 2013 where he said that was a genuine laugh in the recording booth because Pete's lyric was funny to him.
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,beeradthelaw,4,Tue Jul 21 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I really think it's adorable but It sometimes seems like the laugh is like semi- at the same time -ish as the end of the actual line so I couldn't tell if it could be his. Yeah, I've noticed that in some live/acoustic performances he changed ""assholes"" to scandals so it doesn't make him laugh"
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,uluviel,4,Tue Jul 21 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"t in some live/acoustic performances he changed ""assholes"" to scandals so it doesn't make him laugh   Nah they change it when they need to censor ""assholes"" for TV."
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,uluviel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the ones I've seen where they change it weren't for TV, but yeah either way"
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,TheMiraculousCosmos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:29:06 2015 UTC,"Doesn't necessarily means it's for TV, that's the most common occasion, but there are other too like radio shows, sponsored shows, certain festivals, etc. Anytime they need to censor they'll change it.  It's like they do with Save Rock and Roll by changing ""so fuck you"" by ""so forget you"" or by not signing the ""goddamn"" in the Arms Race chorus."
FallOutBoy,3e4cxi,trelanity,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:20:43 2015 UTC,Ok true. Censoring always kinda takes away from the song a little if you ask me
FallOutBoy,3e3kzm,Cazza26,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"I got a shirt from Rebubble back in 2013 with the FaD bears that says ""Survivant du Hiatus."" That's probably not proper French but whatever, I still love the shirt."
FallOutBoy,3e3kzm,beeradthelaw,0,Tue Jul 21 19:42:34 2015 UTC,2013? didn't even know redbubble existed back then xD
FallOutBoy,3e3kzm,beeradthelaw,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had just discovered it during their comeback when I typed ""fall out boy shirts"" in Google."
FallOutBoy,3e3kzm,uluviel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the word ""hiatus"" doesn't mean the same thing in French as it does in English. In French, hiatus can mean: - the succession of two vowels in different syllables - contradictions between two events - a body orifice that's in a long narrow shape    Also, title case doesn't exist in French so Hiatus - if it were the correct word - would need to be lowercase."
FallOutBoy,3e3kzm,beeradthelaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:40 2015 UTC,"All of the text is uppercase actually, to match the text on the album cover. I assumed it wasn't proper French."

FallOutBoy,3e4hmo,Adiquidus24,2,Tue Jul 21 23:02:42 2015 UTC,Okay I was kind of figured that but I still want to know why people dislike the album and WHERE THEY ARE. It's like they don't exist but the band insists that they do.

FallOutBoy,3dwhrw,Blueskyday5,4,Mon Jul 20 02:53:04 2015 UTC,What song was Patrick using that Nashville (Orange Gretsch) on?
FallOutBoy,3dwhrw,DankFOBr,4,Mon Jul 20 02:56:27 2015 UTC,Alone Together
FallOutBoy,3dwhrw,FameDV,2,Mon Jul 20 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"That's kind of strange. I always pictured Alone, Together as being specifically played on his signature guitar. Are you sure it wasn't I'm Like A Lawyer? You're probably right, honestly. It's just hard to wrap my head around. Might've been a back up guitar that they had to use or something."
FallOutBoy,3dwhrw,oppositeofme,4,Mon Jul 20 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't playing I'm Like a Lawyer on this tour.   After a little digging, /u/FameDV is correct"
FallOutBoy,3dwhrw,DankFOBr,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:36 2015 UTC,I see! Thank you! That's interesting that he's using a semi-hollowbody for Alone Together. I wonder if they used it on the newer records.

FallOutBoy,3dyd96,uraka_,7,Mon Jul 20 15:20:35 2015 UTC,I think it's weird that they are using Charlie Puth's recording as a backing track instead of bringing him on tour (not like he's doing anything with his life) or getting Patrick to fill in.
FallOutBoy,3dyd96,DankFOBr,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:16:27 2015 UTC,Maybe they think its disrespectful as that is Paul Walkers song (rip) but I think Patrick would do Paul proud tbh
FallOutBoy,3dyd96,nodaybut_today,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll do it for the last day of tour, like how Hayley last year came out for 'Sugar'."
FallOutBoy,3dyd96,fevered_dreams,3,Mon Jul 20 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt they will have any of the guys fill in for spots. If they were, they would have done it already. It would have been great to see, don't think it'll happen BUT i do think Patrick would kill it if he did Charlie's part."
FallOutBoy,3dyd96,bladedada,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"I was very sure they'd bring that Max kid out to sing that part.  surprising that they just used the track.  also, I am surprised that Wiz is rapping weirdly in Uma when he could have just rapped the part in The Mighty Fall"
FallOutBoy,3dyd96,alternativecheese,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking that this whole time. Patrick needed to go out for See You Again and if they wanted a rapper, they should have put The Mighty Fall in the setlist."

It was so excellent. Okay, so first we waited in line forever, and Patrick came in the wrong door downstairs with his two dogs and we waved at him and he laughed and waved back, but the look on his face was priceless. Then finally the m&g started but we couldn't get anything signed. Then the guy told me I couldn't hug Joe because of his back surgery, and I said ""What about the rest of them?"" And he said I'd have to play it by ear. So when I got up to them I looked at Patrick and then I looked at Pete then I looked back at Patrick and basically just talked to Patrick because I was overwhelmed. He was the first one to talk to me so I was focused on him. And I was like ""Can I hug someone??"" And he said ""You can hug our security guard Matt"" and I looked disappointed but then he laughed and said he was kidding and hugged me tight and pulled me in. Then Pete spun me around and grabbed my waist and we took the picture, because I was so overwhelmed that I just kept looking at them. Then I somehow said really smoothly ""I'll see you later in the front row"" and they were all like yeah? And I was like yeah. So then we left and we cut the whole line (we were supposed to) and then we booked it inside, where we got to the second row. And I was like holy shit yes. And then we watched Max and Hoodie and it was fine. Then Wiz came out, waved at me (idk why) and spit his water on me. Also the guy next to me made me SUPPORT HIS ENTIRE 200 POUNDS OF BODY WEIGHT THE WHOLE SET. People were passing out left and right. It was scary and people were pushing but it was okay. Our whole venue was a pit, so it got crazy. Then Pete came out during Wiz's set and I waved and he mouthed hello at me and I was like Oh my god he recognizes me oh my god. Then FOB started and Pete was right in front of us. At one point Patrick waved directly to my friend, Rachel. Then Rachel got first row and we were freaking out. When it got quieter we yelled to Pete like ""Pete right here! Pete it's us!"" Because he was gonna stage dive. And when he jumped he jumped ON US. Rachel had his legs, I grabbed his hand. The security guard took my hand off of him and Pete got mad and grabbed it back. And I was gonna ask the stage crew to grab me a pick off the stage when it was over, which is exactly when Pete hit me in the face with a pick. Then it all wrapped up. Honestly the best night of my life. I just think it was really cool that they recognized us and intentionally tried to make the show better for us!"

It looks fairly similar to his Squier sig but it's all black. I can see Fender on the headstock tho. I've noticed two knobs whereas his sig only had one. Is this a new variation or upcoming model? A standard? I've been meaning to ask this for a while.

FallOutBoy,3dktf9,thepurplepumpkin,3,Fri Jul 17 02:05:47 2015 UTC,I met Patrick after his solo show at the Metro a couple years ago. Seriously the nicest guy ever.
FallOutBoy,3dktf9,jdk906,2,Fri Jul 17 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"My friend Rachel said she met Patrick after his solo tour too, and she couldn't collect herself so he just hugged her and laughed. I love how understanding they are!"
FallOutBoy,3dktf9,treblemaker97,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would love to hear your stories! I sadly still haven't had the opportunity to meet them, so I would love to here what they were like!"
FallOutBoy,3dktf9,kimmixxclandestine,13,Fri Jul 17 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, I have lots to say! OH MY GOD. It was so excellent. Okay, so first we waited in line forever, and Patrick came in the wrong door downstairs with his two dogs and we waved at him and he laughed and waved back, but the look on his face was priceless. Then finally the m&g started but we couldn't get anything signed. Then the guy told me I couldn't hug Joe because of his back surgery, and I said ""What about the rest of them?"" And he said I'd have to play it by ear. So when I got up to them I looked at Patrick and then I looked at Pete then I looked back at Patrick and basically just talked to Patrick because I was overwhelmed. He was the first one to talk to me so I was focused on him. And I was like ""Can I hug someone??"" And he said ""You can hug our security guard Matt"" and I looked disappointed but then he laughed and said he was kidding and hugged me tight and pulled me in. Then Pete spun me around and grabbed my waist and we took the picture, because I was so overwhelmed that I just kept looking at them. Then I somehow said really smoothly ""I'll see you later in the front row"" and they were all like yeah? And I was like yeah. So then we left and we cut the whole line (we were supposed to) and then we booked it inside, where we got to the second row. And I was like holy shit yes. And then we watched Max and Hoodie and it was fine. Then Wiz came out, waved at me (idk why) and spit his water on me. Also the guy next to me made me SUPPORT HIS ENTIRE 200 POUNDS OF BODY WEIGHT THE WHOLE SET. People were passing out left and right. It was scary and people were pushing but it was okay. Our whole venue was a pit, so it got crazy. Then Pete came out during Wiz's set and I waved and he mouthed hello at me and I was like Oh my god he recognizes me oh my god. Then FOB started and Pete was right in front of us. At one point Patrick waved directly to my friend, Rachel. Then Rachel got first row and we were freaking out. When it got quieter we yelled to Pete like ""Pete right here! Pete it's us!"" Because he was gonna stage dive. And when he jumped he jumped ON US. Rachel had his legs, I grabbed his hand. The security guard took my hand off of him and Pete got mad and grabbed it back. And I was gonna ask the stage crew to grab me a pick off the stage when it was over, which is exactly when Pete hit me in the face with a pick. Then it all wrapped up. Honestly the best night of my life. I just think it was really cool that they recognized us and intentionally tried to make the show better for us!"
FallOutBoy,3dktf9,lolacooper,5,Fri Jul 17 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"That's an amazing story! Patrick literally gives the best hugs! Pete went to hug me and Patrick snatched me right up! They are beyond adorable. I've met them three times now and all three times were a truly amazing experience. They truly love their fans, and you can tell that they would rather just chill and talk to us than have these short meet and greets.

I think I posted it, I didn't post the picture yet though.  But that's amazing!!! They're so supportive and great to their fans! At my M&G Pete remembered from the NYC pop up shop and I nearly cried.

FallOutBoy,3dle6x,Ribknows,2,Fri Jul 17 05:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think that the actual song name is possibly a reference to the baseball player Pete Rose, who was known for headfirst slides. He was accused in a betting scandal, for which he’ll most likely kept out of the Hall of Fame, located in Cooperstown. His name was supposed to appear in the song title, but it didn't because the band thought it would cause a lawsuit against them. Originally, the song was called “Does Your Husband Know?”.  The narrator “Wishes he didn’t want to be a footnote in someone else’s happiness,” And convinces himself that he definitely doesn’t at the present time. The repeated use of “I didn’t” stresses his regret over his earlier actions, while the intonation Patrick uses with “I don’t” shows he’s admadant he’s not like he used to be.  Being “a footnote in someone else’s happiness” means that he doesn’t want someone else to have a happy life, with him as on the sidelines as an afterthought. He either wants to be part of that person’s life, or not involved at all.  I think the whole song is about a man sleeping with a married woman, The narrator doesn't want to be like the husband of the woman he’s singing to, but everyone else already considers him to be like him (behind his back). He spends more time with her than her husband, and sees the way the way the ring reflects the light everywhere around them, which her husband wouldn't know. The only way he sees her is after work, at night. If he spends time with her at all."

FallOutBoy,3dle6x,johnthedudeguy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:09:57 2015 UTC,The song is about Pete Rose like /u/makenoisekilljoys said.
FallOutBoy,3dle6x,matt-tk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"People like to say the song is about Pete Rose but I think it's merely the title that references him while the song is actually about an already-decaying relationship. The different tempos and instrumentation throughout greatly represent the narrator's unstable mindset as he tries to cope with losing the love of his life to someone else. He wishes that her new husband will treat her well (in that classic Wentz sarcastic way) and that he regrets everything that has happened. He no longer wants to be the extremely small portion of her life that he has ultimately become, a ""footnote in someone else's happiness,"" if you will. The chorus is all about him accepting the truth, that he and this new husband are one in the same no matter how much the narrator wants to deny it [I will never end up like him, behind my back I already am]."

FallOutBoy,3dggpc,Adiquidus24,12,Thu Jul 16 02:05:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's either Folie or TTtYG. The new albums are good, but they're not as memorable as the others."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,whatacatch-,11,Thu Jul 16 03:31:11 2015 UTC,"When you name albums such as American Idiot and Black Parade, are you bringing them up because of their success or because the music on those albums are your favorites from these artists?  I ask because for one, in my opinion, American Idiot isn't even half as good as Dookie. And for two, someone's ""best"" album has nothing to do with sales if you ask me.   I think a band's best album will always be subjective. Not every fan or every critic will ever agree on which album is best no matter what it sold or didn't sell. And also,  everyone has a different favorite song, ya know?  FOB has put out some amazing music or they wouldn't still be here. With that said, I think they have a lot more to come."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,pixees,10,Thu Jul 16 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"I understand your points, but I think op makes it relatively clear that they wonder if FOB will put out a CD that doesn't have the fans so divided. A Kid A of sorts.  An album that receives critical acclaim from both fans and reviews.  You can have your favorite CD from whichever artists you choose, but many artists do have a relatively objective ""best"". But you're right, it doesn't necessarily have to do with sales or success of singles."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,Greyshot26,10,Thu Jul 16 11:25:12 2015 UTC,"I personally think to be a really great album, not only does every song have to be brilliant, but the album has to tie together as a whole. American Idiot and Black Parade are both concept albums and essentially rock operas (the songs all work together to tell a story), which I think is what puts them above other work.  I think FoB 2.0 is definitely capable of making something like that; musically they've progressed a long way and the lyrics are as good as ever."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,cgrdrummer,3,Thu Jul 16 09:57:09 2015 UTC,"Their lyrics are as good as ever? I disagree, they have become way too radio-friendly"
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,Applj,2,Fri Jul 17 07:19:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly not a bad thing.  There are so many lyrics that just don't make sense.  I love Pete's writing, but I feel like a lot of times he put too much effort into trying to sound witty and clever than just focusing on writing a solid song."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,tykam993,8,Sun Jul 19 02:44:49 2015 UTC,Fun fact: American Idiot and Black Parade were produced by the same guy!
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,residualblues,6,Thu Jul 16 13:28:47 2015 UTC,"Folie is usually my stock answer for favorite album, which I see as an almost equal attempt at rehabilitation as descent into darkness, digging deep into your mind and having to cope with likely not liking everything you find.  I also personally like Cork Tree a lot, which has become more relevant with age and is particularly fitting to my life right now. You can hear them riding the line between needing to be heard and wondering if it's all a waste of time.   AB/AP seems like the closest currently to the fulfillment of an emotional journey, something that was touched upon on Folie but came to fruition here. I can see the boys at this stage writing letters to themselves as they recorded Cork Tree, is what I'm trying to say.   I don't know if they'll make a universal critic or crowd pleaser, seeing as up till now in all the different forms their records have taken they've been things that need periods of digestion so that they can continue to grow with their listeners. However, every album leaves me with the feeling that if the curtain would close now I'd be perfectly satisfied, and that they'll never cease to blow me away."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,johnthedudeguy,4,Fri Jul 17 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. I love all of their albums but I think that their ""big"" critically acclaimed, grammy winning album is still yet to come."
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,mccurdy_gang,4,Thu Jul 16 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"I think they have made their masterpiece, in Folie. That is their American Idiot"
FallOutBoy,3dggpc,TheFaceo,4,Thu Jul 16 22:05:28 2015 UTC,"Up to this point I'd say Folie a Deux is their most mature and eclectic album, arguably their best. It's my favourite, at least. The day they make a better record than FaD is the day I can die happy."

FallOutBoy,3d68db,alternativecheese,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:49 2015 UTC,We got the same spot also :D   Also where I first met my friend up front without his shirt on.  We had mutual friends before hang but never met. WE bumped into each other at last years show

FallOutBoy,3d7h5c,Mbrannon42,2,Tue Jul 14 03:45:22 2015 UTC,I'll be there! Right-center I believe facing the stage. So stoked!
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,blathersmuseum,3,Mon Jul 13 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"At my M&G, generally they didn't have people sign stuff although there was exceptions. The couple in front of me both made something cool - the woman painted a 1x1 canvas of the SRAR cover (which was really fucking good btw) and the man recreated the AB/AP cover with his 6-year old daughter. Both got signed and I thought that was really cool. But yeah you might or might not get the autographs - just don't get your hopes up too much I'd say."
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,413612,2,Tue Jul 14 03:36:07 2015 UTC,They wouldn't even let me bring my marker in to the photo area. I'm still trying to figure out how they got those signed because I couldn't get my marker in ):
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,kimmixxclandestine,3,Tue Jul 14 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"I literally just made a reddit account so I can talk about my experience with getting something signed at M&G. I went to the June 24 NY date and I've been waiting for this moment forever and knew I was going to sneak something in. From talking to the other girls in line (I was 6th in the m&g line) they said that the guys knew that signing things weren't technically allowed but that they each had their own sharpie.  Right before it was my turn there was a table where you put down you bag and your cell, security will check that you don't have your phone on you! BUT I put my ABAP cd in my back pocket & a sharpie and my shirt was long so it was covered it and I was able to sneak it in. When I got to the guys I immediately huddled in front of them and was all ""I know you're not supposed to sign anything but-"" when the guys each whipped out sharpies from their back pockets! I didn't even finish asking! My friends in front of me in the line panicked and didn't get anything signed so I was the first to ask for my date but it can be done! Just be quick, know exactly what you're getting signed and don't make a big deal about it. A girl I know got something signed plus got Pete to write out lyrics for a tattoo which I didn't although Pete did stop me as I was leaving and called me back so that Jack Edinger could take a pic of my Fall Out Boy themed nails that I showed them when I first got there. Also depends on security and the guys because the chick in front of me was rushed by security and the photographer so she had less than 2 min with the guys while I had what felt like 10 min maybe more:p My sister was right after me and did the same thing. She was able to get her small Save Rock and Roll flag signed!"
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,daicydisaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:41 2015 UTC,It wouldn't hurt to try! I'm planning on getting my ticket signed at least. I know they aren't the ones keeping it strict so I'm sure they wouldn't mind a quick autograph. :)
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,michey1995,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"I don't really know if the security lets you bring markers or something like that, you could hide a lil sharpie or your shoe and after taking the pic be quick!"
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,loveneverwantedme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah they were really lame about it.  You have to sneak your stuff in and ask them right when you get over, takes away from your chance to talk to them, but it can be done. I wanted to get something signed but the security was extra pushy."
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,theshanextm,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:15:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't try.  I went to a radio m&g a few years ago, and we got a big speech about it and they said if he tried something against the rules we'd be escorted out, no questions.  seems like a big risk for very little reward.  you'll only get a minute with them anyways, so spend that time creating a life long memory of conversation, rather than an autograph that will fade."
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,bladedada,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:22 2015 UTC,You won't be kicked out. Just hide the sharpie and ask them to sign. The guys won't say no.
FallOutBoy,3d6rvy,pixees,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"So I have a really unique photo idea that involves a football... Do you think security would allow that? I obviously want to ask them to sign it, but primarily want it for the photo to make sense. Thoughts?"

FallOutBoy,3d4xrq,redjohnsayshi,4,Mon Jul 13 16:18:00 2015 UTC,UK by any chance? We get barely any concerts from good bands and they all sell out so quickly as there are only like 6 decent venues in the while country...
FallOutBoy,3d4xrq,Yack10,2,Tue Jul 14 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"Sweden. There is a very large festival in my home town called Peace and Love. When it was at its largest it consisted of a total of six day, the first three were for spoken word and the like and the last three were all music. They've had very famous bands/artists such as Journey, Alice Cooper, John Fogarty, Rihanna, JC and a lot of local bands such as Mando Diao and some lesser known. They unfortunately had to file for bankruptcy two years ago. They managed to organize a three day festival this year, it was mostly local and Swedish band but it's really fucking great that they have a future and the potential to get bigger in the future!"
FallOutBoy,3d4xrq,redjohnsayshi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:13 2015 UTC,If you drive you'll probably have to pay at least $15-20 for parking and there's always a lot of traffic around the bowl.
FallOutBoy,3d2e16,johnthedudeguy,2,Sun Jul 12 23:45:18 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I know what you're talking about. It was like just a voice and acoustic guitar if I remember correctly.

If you don't and if you don't care for the support acts, take your time. It's generally been Hoodie at 7. Wiz around 7:50 and FOB around 9:30 with the show ending around 11 so being there at 9 should be enough. Here's a thread on tour merch and prizes: https://www.reddit.com/r/FallOutBoy/comments/3cyy1r/some_tour_merch_photos/ and there's some of the merch here: https://shopsidestep.com/shows/463/artists/1/products"
FallOutBoy,3d3nhl,debjay10,2,Mon Jul 13 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of ticket you have. If you have a pit ticket you want to get there as early as possible, like 4+ hours before doors open at least. If you have seats you can arrive whenever you want. Merch and food are expensive. The tour shirt is like $30 and most other things are $30-$50. Water is gonna be like $5 at least and other food drinks are even more expensive."

The atmosphere was wild :D Patrick rocked it so hard last night that he lost his fedora a couple times lol I can't wait to see what they are doing with the footage. Maybe a bundle package of DVD & a new album? Sadly no extra songs last night.
FallOutBoy,3czjis,fevered_dreams,3,Sun Jul 12 13:00:13 2015 UTC,I had wanted to go to this concert. Now I'm so sad I didn't :( I literally have traveled everywhere for their concerts and wanted to see them in their home state. But going to their other ones I went broke. But that's so awesoe!!
FallOutBoy,3czjis,20dollar_nosebleeed,2,Sun Jul 12 17:33:25 2015 UTC,They put on such a good show tonight.
FallOutBoy,3czjis,themwhite3,2,Sun Jul 12 05:25:23 2015 UTC,"That's great, I hope something comes out of it (they mentioned recording one of the shows during the SRAR tour too, and we never got a live DVD from that).  If they do release a DVD I hope they add some extras like some behind the scenes stuff too. And hopefully it comes with a CD."

FallOutBoy,3d2zje,seniorfeeture,10,Mon Jul 13 02:52:07 2015 UTC,They are always going to be experimenting with samples & different types of sound. They've said they love collaborating & bringing new elements to their work. That is most likely going to keep happening.
FallOutBoy,3d2zje,fevered_dreams,4,Mon Jul 13 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"If the last song on AB/AP is any pointer, their next album could be going in a more baroque/chamber rock sound, which is one of my favorite genres, so I'm excited."
FallOutBoy,3d2zje,TheKobraKid,3,Tue Jul 14 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, bands never stop experimenting, every song is a small experiment, and every album is a larger one. If they make new content, they have to stay original, and in order to do that, experimenting with their sound is the best idea."
FallOutBoy,3d2zje,Hey_Youngblood,3,Tue Jul 14 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"As PATD said in their first album, swear to shake it up if you swear to listen. Bands always change, trying new styles or whatever, so just keep listening and you'll find something you like. That's my thinking anyway."

FallOutBoy,3cyhxk,Vintage_Misery,3,Sun Jul 12 09:43:24 2015 UTC,"Not all sororities do it, but it's a tradition for some reason. Either the big sister or little sister makes a decorated paddle of wood for the other. Usually it is very intricately crafted (think: an explosion of Pinterest DIYs) and either has a theme that the recipient likes or is just supposed to be very pretty. For example, perhaps the receiver loves The Little Mermaid. Her paddle-maker may make a Little Mermaid-themed paddle. Oftentimes they have the sorority name and the names of the big and little. I didn't write my sorority name on it, I just put a ribbon on it. That's because my little and I have already left the sorority. I graduated, she had to move on to other things. Our friendship is the focus, not the sorority."

I'm from NYC so anything they do in the tri-state area I try to go to. I also travel a lot for FOB specifically. But also another way to deal with PCD is to try to go to other band concerts to make up for the feeling for not being able to see FOB at the moment."

I've seen them 5 times and never heard 20 Dollar Nosebleed, Disloyal Order, or Coffee's for Closers, but you're right, I have heard What a Catch once or twice.

FallOutBoy,3cvu88,boydivision829,5,Sat Jul 11 22:16:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie. I hated it when it was first released. I think I hated it so much because I loved IOH so much and this one was so different it felt like a let down. I listened to it a few times and then put it away. Shortly after came the hiatus, which only made me more angry at it. But when they announced their comeback, I sat down and listened to it again. Holy shit. I was so wrong. FAD was, and still remains, in my opinion, their best."
FallOutBoy,3cvu88,ecstaticplatypus,11,Sat Jul 11 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"It's by far their best, with Infinity on High closing in on second. They finally find the mix between Whiney and deep, and really blast off in terms of original sound. I don't understand the peeps who think take this to your grave or evening out is somehow better. I'll get cork tree, since that's the album that made them big, and a lot of people bonded to it early, but still."

A lot of the songs just don't hold up for me. There are a couple of great songs, but it's not an album i can consistently listen to all the way through.   I tried to give AB/AP a chance, but there's nothing that stood out. I tried to stick with AB/AP (song) and Uma  Thurman but I think it's only because they're so catchy.   Again, it's my opinion. FOB is my 3rd favorite band and I listen to them ALL the time, but that doesn't mean everything they make is perfect."

FallOutBoy,3cv8th,mcrxlover5,2,Sat Jul 11 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't go to the show by me, but are they doing meet and greet with the band? Because if they are then those people are let in first, and they fill up the barricade spots, and there's not much you can do about it. But speaking from general concert experience the safe amount of time to wait is anywhere from 8-10 hours. It sounds like a lot of time but you're surrounded by people who all share a common interest and if you go with friends its a lot of fun to hang out there"

But yea if you have VIP then you should be fine if you get there before 11"
FallOutBoy,3cv8th,numberthangold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:00:24 2015 UTC,I was on the rail and I got there about 2:30 for doors at 6. It depends though obviously.   Edit: also I ended up in front of some VIP people!
FallOutBoy,3cv8th,emkcj,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:56:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if all shows are like this but when I had VIP tickets on June 20th it went like this:  There was a separate lineup for vip ticketholders and it said to be there by 4 pm, got there around 3pm. I was still near the front, about 10th in line so it worked out well. (Note it was probably the smallest city on this tour so I'd get there a couple hours early instead of one)  Once the meet and greet was done, you'd get to go to the barricade and pretty much anyone who was VIP ended up at the barricade. I'd just hold on because people will try to push you and take your spot. Anyone who had regular pit tickers got in about 30-45 mins later."
FallOutBoy,3cv8th,kimmixxclandestine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out not all venues will release you early. Luckily for the show I was just at we finished the meet and greet before doors opened (the pit is actually super small there, it maybe holds 100 people) but last year we didn't finish before doors opened and the m&g I did before that they held us until doors opened. We had our own line, but a lot of people didn't get barricade.  So get there early so you are closer to the front of the line, and be prepared to run where you need to go if your venue holds you back."
FallOutBoy,3cv8th,20dollar_nosebleeed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"The people that are able to be on the rail are normally the VIP. So there's about 100 people or so for the FOB VIP. But that can depend on the venue, it could be a little more or less. With that being said, all of the people with a VIP ticket get to be in the pit first (if that venue has a pit).  If you don't have a VIP ticket, the earlier you can get there to wait in line the better. As said above, you're surrounded by people who have a common interest with you so it's not that bad at all :)"

(It also was my third and most recent tattoo).  Honestly, pick the lyric that makes you stop and go 'wow', no matter how many times you hear it.  Think about why your favourite song is your favourite.   Other lyric tattoos I would consider (but probably wouldn't get): 'I will defend the faith going down swinging', 'long live the car crash hearts', 'I thought I loved you, it was just how you looked in the light', 'Troubled thoughts and self esteem to match', 'nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy' - the list goes on."

Although, thinking back now, I may have had an anxiety attack during my first tattoo (which was a Rent tattoo on the top of my foot and covers the entire top of my foot).   However, I like your lyric choice. I don't think people will think that you spelled 'souls' wrong - it's an obvious play on words.   Also, like you said - make sure you're in love with the idea.

And what it is, sounds sort of psychotic but I swear I didn't have any psycho stalker thoughts when I got it.  The only friend I have that's really into FOB lives 5hrs away from me in Virginia. Anyway back in 2007 (I can't remember the name of the tour, it was the one with Gym Class Heroes and ... Plain White T's?? I think and a couple of others) I bought tickets for my friend and I to go to the show up in Fairfax. It was the first time her and I went to see FOB together (and her first FOB show in general). We had so much fun and it was definitely a memorable show/trip. We were standing outside with a group of people after the show near the buses. Patrick and I assume his bodyguard came out and Patrick did a few quick signings. I realized I didn't have anything for him to sign so I was like ""uh, can you sign my arm?"" He did. He finished his signings as scurried back to tour bus land. (I commented on another thread about never seeing Patrick outside a show, saying he was like a mysterious creature or some shit. I totally wrote that in disregard to this situation. After the fact I was like you dumb ass, it's right on your arm, it happened once. Not like anyone really cares but I gotta clear that up).  In the car on the way back my friend was like ""you should get that tattooed."" I thought it was a dumb idea, but on the long car ride back the next day back to my house I thought about it, and I thought it would be kind of a cool, unique way to remember our first FOB show together, and our time together in general since I rarely get to see her.  Sooooo when I got back to my town I went to the first tattoo shop I found and got it tatted, with ""fall out boy"" written above it in the Infinity on High font. It's a really shitty tattoo, but I love it for the meaning behind it.   TLDR - yeah i have a FOB tattoo. It's shitty and cool at the same time."

""Her words destroyed my planet "" is a super fun song (off their best album imo) but the video is even better. Science fair. Robots. Nerdy dance routine. Pretty fabulous."

FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,SaturdayNightAgain,9,Wed Jul 8 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"You could check out The Hush Sound. The Academy Is..., Something Corporate, Jack's Mannequin, Bayside, Jimmy Eat World, New Politics, Shout Out Louds, TV On the Radio. There's probably quite a few more but those are some that come to mind."
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,Wiinamex,10,Wed Jul 8 19:44:47 2015 UTC,New Politcs! Yes!
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,TheMiraculousCosmos,2,Wed Jul 8 20:42:05 2015 UTC,I like Jimmy Eat World and The Academy Is... are decent too! Thanks for the suggestions :)
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,OmgItsMarv,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:22 2015 UTC,I like The Hush Sound - We Intertwined. It reminds me of 20 Dollar Nose Bleed!
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,Oceanesta,6,Sat Jul 11 19:46:03 2015 UTC,I like some of Ludo's songs such as Love Me Dead or Go-Getter Greg. Check it out and see if you like it :D
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,Oceanesta,5,Wed Jul 8 22:25:58 2015 UTC,Outlines by All Time Low was co-written by Patrick Stump so I think it has a different sound than their usual stuff.
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,Oceanesta,3,Wed Jul 8 16:50:23 2015 UTC,Yes. This is the only ATL song in my iTunes library.
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,cslayer23,6,Wed Jul 8 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or do all All Time Low songs sound very similar? I don't know what it is. I've tried getting into their stuff so much but I can never distinguish between songs! Does anyone else find this?"
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,acitycalledcoma,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Depends on which era of ATL you're listening to. The newer songs sound quite similar to each other for its 'mainstream' sound, but their older stuff is worth a listen. Try listening to ATL's ""The Party Scene"" album and ""Put Up or Shut Up"" EP."
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,thebrandnew,4,Thu Jul 9 09:42:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Cobra Starship get a mention. They were big in the bandom scene back around the FUCT/IOH, pre-split Panic!, MCR-actually-existing era.  Their latest album is absolute garbage, judge them on their first two albums (Viva La Cobra! and While The City Sleeps We Rule The Streets)."
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,emkcj,3,Thu Jul 9 09:33:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, and check out The Brobecks. Dallon Weekes' old band."

FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,chifob,3,Wed Jul 8 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"so many great recommendations so far. my itunes library is pretty much stuck in 2005 with bands that have long since broken up but i'm going to add andrew mcmahon in the wilderness, taking back sunday, brand new, have mercy, the spill canvas, midtown, sugarcult, and this providence."
FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,alineinasong,2,Thu Jul 9 04:08:50 2015 UTC,That sounds just like my library. haha  I LOVE your username!

FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,alineinasong,2,Thu Jul 9 14:25:48 2015 UTC,I've had the hardest time trying to get into a lot of new music. I like a lot of random bands from satellite radio but I can't seem to get into any as much as FOB or other older bands.

FallOutBoy,3ck1ab,debjay10,3,Tue Jul 14 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Their Riot! album is my favourite by far, specifically For a Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic, That's What You Get, Misery Business, and Born for This.

FallOutBoy,3cibbf,pixees,6,Wed Jul 8 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"Nope, it's FOB's ""The Mighty Fall"" symbol. Pete discussed it before. Here's a photo."

FallOutBoy,3ccaed,chifob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:05:15 2015 UTC,It's either pay for parking or parking on a side street if you can find a non- permit parking spot. Parking in the city truly does suck.
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,fevered_dreams,2,Tue Jul 7 01:23:05 2015 UTC,it truly does suck! is the pay for parking all parallel parking as well? honestly I am horrible at it as its not needed in the suburbs.  Im so clueless at this whole area of chicago.
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,chifob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:38:34 2015 UTC,Yeah i do believe the pay parking is all parallel over there unless they've opened up a few regular parking spots like they did near my place. There are two spots by me....like tiny parking lots maybe 6 or 7 cars long.
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,fevered_dreams,2,Tue Jul 7 01:47:16 2015 UTC,hmmm. Thanks for the info! I really want FOB is for lovers. i can get the other shirt at the concert. are you going Saturday?
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,chifob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:09:22 2015 UTC,"No problem :) Yeah i want to get the same one or a ""This is our culture"" jacket. I'll be there Friday & Saturday (I would like to meet Pete). I had plans on going with a couple friends but they sadly couldn't call off work so'm going solo."
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,fevered_dreams,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"Im doing VIP at the concert which is why I am more concerned over the shirt. i can get the chi/la shirt at the show but ive wanted fob is for lovers for 10ys!! I met Pete many years ago at the clandestine store, which was quick but great! at least they are working. my friends roll their eyes when i say concert!!"
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,chifob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:26:31 2015 UTC,Sadly i was unable to get VIP for the concert this Saturday so next best thing..to see Pete of course!! Even though i'd like to meet them all. I'll just have to make due. I've been a long time fan. Never met them in person but I've been to a few concerts. Good luck with getting that shirt!
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,fevered_dreams,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:59 2015 UTC,of course its the next best thing! I met him at the clan store many years ago and it was a great time! met Patrick after his solo show and andy randomly outside a venue before a show.  They did a signing for FAD years ago so Ive met all of them. this is my first vip so im excited! still debating on going to get the shirt.  Im also hoping that it wont be too crowded in the afternoon if I do go.

Plus driving 4 hours to buy some merch is a little excessive. Maybe if they were playing too. Lol"
FallOutBoy,3ccaed,kimmixxclandestine,2,Tue Jul 7 00:21:14 2015 UTC,I looked up flights to see if I could make the popup shop and Chicago show work out lol

FallOutBoy,3ccaed,kimmixxclandestine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:42:53 2015 UTC,I got there at 11 pm the night before the signing and was 2nd in line. it for Chicago you might have to go earlier since it's close to their home town.

FallOutBoy,3ccaed,floofychu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:12:08 2015 UTC,Is that black and white baseball tee only at the pop up shops or are they at the tour too?
FallOutBoy,3cdre4,seidlka,3,Tue Jul 7 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"He only does the signing on the second day. I camped out for the NYC pop-up shop from 11pm the night before and I wound up being second in line. However, since it is Chicago and it's near their hometown, you might need to get there earlier because of the amount of people that might come to that one.   Something to keep in mind too, if you can go the first day and get your wristband, I'd do that. (I couldn't because the first day led into my dads birthday and I couldn't miss that lol). I noticed while I was there that the 50 people that got it the first day were able to show up by 12pm the 2nd day (the day of the signing) and not have to worry about buying merch, not finding a size in something they wanted ect.   Another thing to keep in mind is you have to buy a minimum of one shirt in order to do the signing. They had smaller items like lighters, patches, buttons ect but those didn't count unless it added up to $30. And at that point you're better off getting a shirt that you probably won't see again.  Good luck!! Camp out and make friends through here that you can sit with throughout the night, it's what I did and it was TOTALLY worth it! :)   If you have any other questions let me know!"
FallOutBoy,3cdre4,20dollar_nosebleeed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"I was planning on coming at 1 am for the friday pop up in chicago in hopes of being one of the first 50. I have a train to catch to leave Saturday morning, so even if I do get a wristband I don't even get to go to the signing? Am I understanding that correctly?"
FallOutBoy,3cdre4,mksnitgen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:22:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly, that's correct :/ He only does the signing on the second day so even if you are there on friday and you get a wristband, you'll be able to buy merch but not meet him on Friday. Also as a side note, it's 50 people each of the 2 days, a total of 100 people get to go to the signing."
FallOutBoy,3cdre4,20dollar_nosebleeed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:25:57 2015 UTC,He only signs on the second day. They're playing a show somewhere else on Friday. They hand out 50 wristbands per day for a 100 total to return on Saturday.   People were camping out to guarentee a spot in NYC.
FallOutBoy,3capss,lawrenceorbach,4,Mon Jul 6 12:55:40 2015 UTC,It's generally been Hoodie at 7. Wiz around 7:50 and FOB around 9:30 with the show ending around 11. It may be slightly different for each venue.

FallOutBoy,3capss,bloodyhaze,2,Mon Jul 6 14:14:50 2015 UTC,Went to the pittsburgh show and thats exactly the times for the concert.
FallOutBoy,3capss,mccurdy_gang,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:52:13 2015 UTC,Have you tried calling your venue and asking? I did that for my concert and they had a pre-recorded message with all of the information on when the lot opened and the stage times for everyone. They should definitely be able to provide you with that info :)

FallOutBoy,3cbjkz,Vintage_Misery,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:58:35 2015 UTC,With current exchange rates its £89.70 for the VIP upgrade. You will need to buy a ticket to the show on top of that though.  I wasn't charged any extra for it being in dollars rather than pounds.
FallOutBoy,3cbjkz,unicollide,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:46 2015 UTC,thanks for the info. i'll book the tickets right away.

We just needed to let our managers know tomorrow, so we won't have the email in time. They should really send it out a little earlier, that extra half an hour makes a difference when it comes to traffic like you said. But when you're working hourly that extra half an hour makes a difference in your paycheck too! Haha"

FallOutBoy,3c6nrb,Yogbox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"I will be at that show too!   They announced a while back that there would be VIP tickets for the European shows that will include Meet & Greets but no such tickets have been on sale so far. They most likely won't come out after the show. They did that once in Berlin but that was after their post-hiatus show at a much smaller venue. Some of the younger fans will probably be there all day to make front row but I wouldn't worry about it too much. If you want to be on the safe side, get there when the doors open. Personally, I'm gonna be there either in time for the support acts (depending on who they will be) or half an hour before FOB's set. Once the show starts, it should be easy enough to get nearer to the front.   There is no lockers but they have a cloakroom.   FOB don't change their setlist a lot. Since it's the AB / AP tour, I guess there will be about 6 songs from that record as well as the usual ones from their other albums. It's going to look something like this plus a few more: http://www.setlist.fm/stats/average-setlist/fall-out-boy-33d6bc71.html?year=2015   Here's a list of their most played songs. It will be 70% out of the 25 first songs listed there as well as AB /AP songs: http://www.setlist.fm/stats/fall-out-boy-33d6bc71.html  If I were you, I would check back with setlist fm once the European/UK leg of the tour starts. It will be the same setlist for each of those shows anyhow.  Hope this helps"
FallOutBoy,3c6nrb,debjay10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:32:15 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! So does the cloak room cost money? I'm guessing there are no locks. So it's just for coats.. I see :[ I think i'll be there 2 hours before the doors open since im really eager to be on the front. What do you think? Or is it pointless?
FallOutBoy,3c6nrb,debjay10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :) I think it's 1€ per item so you can leave your coat as well as your bag. There's staff there all the time so your stuff will be save.   You can be there 2 hours before doors open but I wouldn't recommend it. It's likely going to be cold and rainy and there is not toilets or food nearby. Keep in mind that there is likely going to be 2 support acts which amounts to a lot of waiting time (doors at 7, first support act at 8, second at 9, FOB at 10). In my opinion, it's a waste of time. Just get there in time for doors and you should be fine :)  PS: Why are you so eager on making front row? Personally, I prefer dancing and moshing (if possible) to just standing there and being squashed by other people ;)"

FallOutBoy,3c2fii,pixees,8,Sat Jul 4 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't take many photos this show because I'm sick of watching concerts through my cellphone. Butttttt I did get to meet /u/mccurdy_gang which was awesome! You were a blast, I hope we can do future shows together! Posted a photo of she and I together :)  Also shout out to whoever the group of guys w/ the AB/AP masks who let me take their picture. I'm sorry I asked you all if you'd marry me. I was a bit tipsy.  Anyways, as for the meet & greet. It was great except some girls in front of me ruined it for the rest of us (I couldn't get my Gray book signed bc security took FOB's markers) because (apparently) the girls had a bunch of stuff to get signed and wouldn't leave when security was telling them their time was up because one of them was crying etc. Which fine, like I get it, cry but don't disregard the rules and ruin it for the rest of us.  With that said, I miss the table. I miss walking down the line and shaking hands and saying hi or whatever while they sign things. I don't care about the actual autograph since I have plenty but idk the interaction this time just wasn't the same. Sure I loved that I got to hug them all (minus Joe who just gave high fives bc of his back) but I'd rather have more interacting than a hug, ya know?  The show was great. I got to actually see Hoodie and Wiz this time (last show I was late and missed them) and Hoodie was eh. Wasn't very entertained. Wiz was pretty cool. One more show in August and I'm done. Post concert depression is setting in!    TLDR Show was great, m&g needs to go back to how it was before, met a fellow redditor"
FallOutBoy,3c2fii,mccurdy_gang,2,Sat Jul 4 03:23:35 2015 UTC,<3 it was so awesome meeting up with you unintentionally! Our picture turned out so great and we will definitely have to coordinate for the next tour :)

Such a bummer when other people ruin shit for everyone else, should've like, found them in the crowd and ""accidentally"" spilled beer on them. Semi-jk, that shit is so expensive at shows, gotta take out a second mortgage to afford it. Also, I agree with you about the hoodie/wiz thing."
FallOutBoy,3c2fii,dontgivecatsbeer,5,Sat Jul 4 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! hahaha right I spent $17/drink because I didn't want beer, I wanted liquor. I also spent $5 on a bottled water and $9 on cheese fries. Sigh.  But yeah next year I'm gonna bring my own damn marker. I want my book signed. lol"
FallOutBoy,3c2fii,dontgivecatsbeer,7,Sat Jul 4 03:44:53 2015 UTC,"$9 cheese fries?!?!?! Madness!! But cheese fries are damn good, especially when alcohol is involved.  I have a FOB-my-own-marker story: I took my own marker last year, I was getting my YBC poster signed and I figured they probably just had black, so I took one of those fancy silver ones so the sigs would show up. Anyway I handed it to Patrick and he was like ""oh, I'm not too fond of these sharpies, they don't work well"" or something along those lines.  I thought to myself ""SO SORRY, PLEASE FORGIVE ME SENPAI FOR I HAVE FAILED YOU WITH MY MARKER CHOICE.""  I still have the marker and randomly come across it from time to time and look at it in disgust.   But yes, bringing your own marker would be a good idea. Maybe 2 or 3, incase their security tries to confiscate pen #1 >:("
FallOutBoy,3c2fii,kimmixxclandestine,5,Sat Jul 4 03:56:52 2015 UTC,"Hahahhaa that's a great story and even better bc I too would've been like ""omg Patrick hates me now bc of my choice of marker fucking great"""

I started to think he was an elusive creature, kind of like the lochness monster, and they were just pulling some Tupac hologram type of shit on stage. My friend was sweet and bought me a m&g ticket last year since I've never been able to do it before. And I was like, dammit just my luck. THIS IS FINALLY HAPPENING AND I DUN GOOFED."

(As I respond a week later..)  Overall, did you feel like the meet and greet worth it? Getting to see a few acoustic songs in an intimate setting would be fantastic, but with a band that's so easily accessible to chat with after any given show, I kind of felt like it was a bit pricey to drop $100 for a couple of songs, you know? Do I sound like a total snob right now? Haha."
FallOutBoy,3bykug,residualblues,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"Nah dude, I don't think you sound like a total snob at all. I actually struggled with the price too. Like you said they've always been a super accessible band (especially Justin). I've met them all several times after shows and such. Honestly the reason I ended up going for it was 28 was a big year for me as far as shows. I had done m&g with my two other fave bands (fob and coheed and cambria [granted I had amazingly awesome friends who were kind and bought me tickets for those]) and I figured I'd just round it out with mcs. Since high school my musical ""triforce"" has been those three bands.  MCS ended up being, by far, my fave m&g experience out of the 3. I think at my show there was only like, 10 people total doing the m&g. It was super chill, you could actually like, hang out and talk. The acoustic sing a long was so much fun. I'm really glad I ended up going thru with doing it. A big part of the reason I stay an MCS fan is because they're all genuinely nice people and kind to their fans, so the m&g was worth it, in my opinion. Oddly enough, it was ran by the same people who are doing FOB's m&g this time around."
FallOutBoy,3bykug,dontgivecatsbeer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"That's so great! I mean, I would expect a M&G with MCS would be nothing but fun since, like you said, they're genuinely nice people and super kind to/very appreciative of their fans.

I don't know much about them other than a handfull of songs but they always seemed like good people).  Random question: Was Justin actually speaking at the M&G? I know he's always on vocal rest after shows, and while I've met him countless times, I think I've only ever had a couple conversations where we were both talking, heh."
FallOutBoy,3bykug,residualblues,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"Nah, he was pretty talkative, goofing around etc. I guess cause the m&g was before the show. I'm so glad I've found someone who appreciates MCS as much as I do, obviously I know they have fans since I see them at shows, but it's nice to like, have a convo about how great they are. Fun fact - i have a letter from Justin framed in my bathroom that gives me inspiration every day hahaha. It was from that photoshop contest he did a few years ago, I was one of the winners. I just love that he's done fun stuff like that, and I love how much he interacts with the fans. Curious - do you live anywhere NC? Wold be cool to find an ""MCS buddy"" to hang out with at their shows. :D   C&C are cool people, love that band. My daughter is actually named Cambria after them."
FallOutBoy,3bykug,dontgivecatsbeer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"Oh good! I figured it was more of an after show thing. I can't ever decide if it's more fun actually talking to him or playing the miming game while trying to have a conversation.  I remember that photoshop contest, that's so awesome! And no, I'm in Ohio but I'm also MCS buddy-less anymore since my baker friend moved away. I guess if we're ever in each others neighborhoods, yeah?"

I know my own kids are going to do that to somebody one day and hopefully that person's not gonna be an asshole   and    This guy comes up to me and is like, 'Hey, Pete from Fall Out Boy. Good job on the Today show.' And I was like, '...cool.' And he was like, 'John Bon Jovi.' And I was like, 'No fucking way.'

FallOutBoy,3bumab,nonspecificloser,2,Thu Jul 2 15:05:06 2015 UTC,I think he was only douchey because he was exhausted and couldn't really think.

It actually hasn't been too long (I think it'll be about 3 years around the time the new album comes out? Or has it been three years already? Pretty sure I saw them the summer of 2012 and they were already touring on GO?), but then again, for a band that works so much that's a bit of time between albums. If they hadn't turned the CTTM tour into a full year of shows, I bet it would have been out sooner.  That's funny, my friend is a baker and she's actually made cupcakes for MCS a few times now, and they're always excited about them! I think Justin actually referred to her as ""Cupcakes"" the last time she saw them, hahaha."

Oh well, soon 6 will be here!  That's really awesome about your friend with the cupcakes. You really can't go wrong with cupcakes. Do they have a favorite kind? Or does she just bake whatever she's feelin?   Speaking of baking, how'd you get that little pie icon next to your username?"

Or maybe something chocolate and bacon? I think last time she saw them she made apple spice cake ones.) and they're the best cupcakes I've ever had.  It must have been my Reddit cake day!

My first Fall out boy concert - when they opened for Blink-182 - started with this song and I will never forget how awesome it was to be in the pit, seeing their silhouettes prepare for the show, and then watching Stump stomp his foot to the widely-recognized drum beat that opens the song.  Couldn't afford nice tickets but when I heard what the opening song was I bought nosebleeds by myself. Idgaf"

Maybe in some time we can do this again but people put their songs in order from favorite to least favorite and there are points distributed? Would anyone be down to do this?
FallOutBoy,3bc81s,ITSABARE,2,Mon Jun 29 20:26:32 2015 UTC,That could be hard to rank. This quiz was hard enough to pick just one from each album lol
FallOutBoy,3bc81s,thebestpartofbelieve,2,Tue Jun 30 19:24:06 2015 UTC,Or maybe a top like 3? I don't know. I just feel like the results would be a little different if done this way. And it's not just my own personal preference (my fave on AB/AP is Centuries but I can understand its low rank on the survey) there's songs that I thought were fan/sub favorites that didn't score as high. I think it's just because only 1 could be chosen.
FallOutBoy,3bc81s,ITSABARE,2,Tue Jun 30 20:07:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that made it difficult. I thought you were saying to rank all songs with points :P that would be hard.  picking top three from each album could be fun!

I'm not sure of the seating though honestly., I have a GA ticket. I imagine it's similar to Hershey Park Stadium, but I hope not with the folding chairs again."

FallOutBoy,3b18ma,jups2709,2,Thu Jun 25 04:17:35 2015 UTC,Not at all definitely the most amazing experience of my life! He's so nice honestly and felt so special that he wrote something special in the book!
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,bluest_blue,7,Thu Jun 25 04:29:57 2015 UTC,That's so awesome!! I met Patrick a while back and he was super cool as well. I love stories like these. :)

FallOutBoy,3b18ma,chifob,2,Thu Jun 25 15:26:48 2015 UTC,What a great experience! I was nervous when I clicked on it that it would be disappointing. So glad it was as great as it was! And I adore your glasses! 😎
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,starlight0229,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:30:49 2015 UTC,Thansk! Yeah it was definitely the best experience of my life honestly lol. And thank you! 😎
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,chifob,2,Sat Jun 27 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"that sounds like an amazing experience! so glad it was a relaxed atmosphere for you. when i met him at the clandestine store in chicago years ago, the organizers kind of rushed you! got a brief chat at a FAD signing. hoping for amazing at vip 7/11!"
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,starlight0229,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:28:39 2015 UTC,The people organizing it were pretty on top of things and everything ran super smoothly. They even opened the shop like 15 minutes early. They did say don't ask him to draw out you first tattoo (no clue who asked that) or like wrote a giant novel. And honestly I'm so happy it was such an organic meeting with him that he naturally wrote something heartfelt and wasn't told to. That's what really meant tme very thing.
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,chifob,2,Thu Jun 25 04:33:37 2015 UTC,opened early!?!? heartfelt is the best. so happy for you!!! oh what did you end up buying at the store?
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,fevered_dreams,2,Thu Jun 25 04:38:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm still surprised they opened early. But I got the ""You look so NY but but you feel so LA"" shirt (I'm saving up to move out to Cali from here so it describes my life), the FOB hoodie, the FOB is for Lovers shirt and the This is our Culture bomber jacket."
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,fevered_dreams,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"that shirt is perfect for you if you are trying to move to LA!!  I've wanted the FOB is for lovers shirt for 10 years so i hope they put the chicago pop up somewhere easily accessible from the suburbs.  i want the chicago/la shirt as well. my ""no concert merch"" rule went out the window for this show!  i love the jacket and hoodie. so jealous of all your great finds."
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,chifob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"If you make it to the Chicago popup would you be willing to pick up an extra fob is for lovers shirt? I've also wanted it for 10 years! I'm originally from the suburbs, but live in VA now (and the state slogan is Virginia is for lovers) so it's a perfect blend of everything for me. I would obviously PayPal you for the shirt and shipping."
FallOutBoy,3b18ma,chifob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:13:25 2015 UTC,"thats virginia's slogan?? thats crazy. its going to 100% depending on where it is if i attend. hoping its suburbs somewhere with the concert in tinley.  if its up north like the store was, its not happening.  i can let you know."

FallOutBoy,3b0xft,pixees,2,Thu Jun 25 02:55:04 2015 UTC,That's worth the price though! To get to be closer to the stage.   Has anyone here ever done one of these concerts and can give any details as to what it's like? How many songs do headliners preform usually?
FallOutBoy,3b0xft,bladedada,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"I saw them play at a state fair a few years back.  not in Illinois though.    it was the weirdest show I have ever been too.  there was no ""pit"".  just folding chairs in the grass.  they were also very far from the stage.  it was different, for sure.  the GA seating area was behind the chairs.  so we were sitting in the front, and then all these random people stood behind us.  so odd.    there was no opener or anything.  they just kinda walked out.  there was none of the usually stuff on screens, smoke pyro whatever.  it was very stripped down.  to me, that was awesome.  I really enjoyed that.    As soon as Saturday started, it was like everyone knew exactly what to do and they ran up and Pete jumped out.  I didn't.  because, well, I didn't want to get crushed my 16 year old girls.    overall it was a great show. . . but it was . . . strange."
FallOutBoy,3b0xft,pixees,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:35:10 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks! How long did they preform?
FallOutBoy,3b0xft,bladedada,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:44:19 2015 UTC,their standard set.  maybe like 90 minutes?

FallOutBoy,3azuxr,StrobesNQueens,3,Wed Jun 24 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"Explanation for why he put that on the card: the guy in front of me had a bunch of things for his family. When Pete finished signing them, the guy said, “Thanks, Pete,” sincerely, then followed it up with, “Haha! I said, ‘Thanks, Pete’!” and Pete was like, “Haha. Yeah.” Except you could see in his eyes that he was screaming internally.  I also shook his hand and gave him a letter. I don't know if he'll read it, but the whole thing was still really awesome.  (Shout-out to /u/20dollar_nosebleeed for chilling with me and helping make sure I got to do the signing!)"
FallOutBoy,3az4cc,levarius32,6,Wed Jun 24 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"Fall Out Boy were potent because they knew how to market themselves and knew how to make very accessible music, much like Chris did. Very few bands from the scene (My Chem, All-American Rejects off the top of my head) stayed relevant in the mainstream mid-to-late 00s because they knew to command control of their fans and the masses and adapt. Record labels signed so many similar bands in hopes that they would strike the same success, but they oversaturated the market and things just weren't the same anymore."
FallOutBoy,3az4cc,thebrandnew,3,Wed Jun 24 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. People loved to hate on Pete back then but you gotta give him props for being incredibly intuitive on how to push FOB's name out there.  Plus pop-punk/emo-pop is a pretty narrow genre to begin with (pop-punk especially). There's only so much a band can do before eventually having to broaden their sound in order to keep things fresh, and that was the risk the masses of bands that faded into obscurity weren't very willing to take. Thus the 'carbon copy of a carbon copy'. I used to be into the whole 'emo' movement in the mid 00's and even I couldn't keep up with it. Pretty much the only bands that survived back then went beyond the typical 'emo' sound."

FallOutBoy,3auxx0,ruke3645,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:35:14 2015 UTC,No problem just clarifying! How do you like the guitar so far?
FallOutBoy,3auxx0,SaturdayNightAgain,2,Tue Jun 23 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"I love it! My only real gripe with it is that two of the knobs are very loose, and they've popped off a couple of times,  but that's more of a manufacturing issue. The guitar itself is very light, the neck is super smooth, and overall has a great tone to it. The pickups don't have enough variation, but that's nothing a couple good pedals can't fix.   It's my current favorite guitar! :)"

FallOutBoy,3amyqo,straightontillnow,8,Sun Jun 21 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"""Sell Out"" is peoples' go-to insult when they dislike the direction a band takes their sound. (Been battling rolling my eyes at ""they're sell outs!"" in the Linkin Park fanbase for years, despite the fact that their popularity has been shrinking.) It's weird how people seem to think that they can just go ""they're sell outs"" and generally be rude and still expect to be taken seriously, and then get all ""you just don't want to ADMIT IT"" when people say they don't care. If you really wanted to make a point or establish an opinion/criticism/objective observation on the band/musical artist, you wouldn't be so rude and obviously subjective. Dissenting opinions are fine. Being a dick isn't."

Hahahaha no, they were a mainstream act years prior, they have an established fanbase, and they made a record that they wanted to, not one that a record label forced them to make.   It's such a lazy go-to insult for uncreative haters."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,beeradthelaw,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"From now on, whenever someone says an artist I like is a ""sell out"", I'll just go ""meh"".  People who take time to say bullshit about artists that has done nothing but put out music are train wrecks in my book. People can call out the artists if they did something shitty or problematic (racist, sexist, LGBTphobic, etc), but branding them as ""sell outs"" because they don't like the direction the band is heading is hilarious.  Also, unless the band says that they did sell out, no one could never claim that as a fact."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,HooolySmokes,-15,Mon Jun 22 06:24:34 2015 UTC,"Not everyone is complaining about it. They did/have sold out, it's a fact. Not everyone is against it though."

FallOutBoy,3amyqo,uluviel,-11,Sun Jun 21 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"So when a band goes from making low key, somewhat underground music with a small fan base to becoming known worldwide and changing their music to include a wider fan base and making much, much, much more money, it isn't called selling out? Please enlighten me to what the proper terminology is.  Selling out doesn't have a negative meaning, it's just a lot of the rabid fans on here that will defend Fall Out Boy blindly have given the term a negative connotation because of their knee jerk reactions to anything that could even be mildly conceived as an insult."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,IAmTriscuit,10,Sun Jun 21 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"Changing your sound with the purpose of making more money = selling out Changing your sound because you want to and your newer sound being popular = being successful  You can sell out without being successful. You can be successful without selling out. You can do both. You can do neither.  Unless we know exactly why they're changing their sound we don't know if they're selling out or not. They've said in interviews before that they are not doing this for money - they may be lying, of course (if they are doing this for money they certainly aren't going to tell the press) but unless we hook them up to a lie detector, we don't know."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,uluviel,-1,Sun Jun 21 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"One of their new songs was literally wrote by a pop song writing team and shipped around before it ended up in their hands which is complete bullshit. That's kinda selling out, past FOB never bought in songs."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,alphadog27,5,Mon Jun 22 11:14:36 2015 UTC,Which song? Source?
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,dontsneeze,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"Centuries. 22 minute video from the producer who speaks of how his team had the chorus, sample, etc all fleshed out before shipping the song around: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_jtB5R9-yovv  In saying that it's one of the few tracks that stand out to me from the album haha. Another song samples a whole electronic song. Nothing against their sound nowadays- it feels like they were pressured to pump out another album that sounded like SRAR, feels so lazy by their standards...that's the issue."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,alphadog27,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're totally right. I watched that video when it first came out but must not have been paying close enough attention. Sounds like most of the song was written before FOB got their hands on it.  They definitely use samples in their songs (Phoenix samples a Plan B song) which I don't think necessarily equates to ""selling out."" However, FOB changed their sound and (as I just learned) buys songs, which to me does mean they sold out.  However, I don't really give a shit. They've worked really hard and deserve massive success. As long as I can still enjoy their music, whatever. Don't think I'll be heading to any of their shows anytime soon though."
FallOutBoy,3amyqo,dontsneeze,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:11:58 2015 UTC,"Didn't realise The Phoenix had a sample as it was uncredited, thanks for pointing that out! Seems it's actually sampled from Dmitri Shostakovich (Symphony No.7 ""Leningrad"" 4th Movement Part 1) though. Both Plan B and Peter Fox also seem to sample the same piece.  I agree somewhat with you, they deserve continuous success but just makes me feel iffy when those guys are amazing song writers of their own accord haha.

FallOutBoy,3alwou,docdo1,14,Sun Jun 21 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"Wow I just never get sick of the ""they're sellouts"" narrative. /s  That theory doesn't really work when you know that Novocaine has been cut from two different albums, meaning it was originally written during the Folie era.  I always read Novocaine to be about Pete's relationship with the press (tabloids especially). If you take it from this angle, it fits pretty seamlessly with the themes on Folie à deux, actually."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,uluviel,9,Sun Jun 21 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"Solid theory, really well presented and thought out. Found myself coming to a different conclusion about the song though: that it was rather about the idea that it doesn't really matter anymore what FOB say or do, people are always going to see them how they want to see them."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,FameDV,17,Sun Jun 21 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"It's an ok theory. Here's my issues:  1.) Folie a Deux lacked a distinctive sound? Are you kidding me? FAD was the most unique album they made. You name me one song they've made outside of FAD that sounds like a FAD song.   2.) FOB knows a lot of people hate them, but I think they also know they are respected as artists, for the most part. Take this verse from The (Shipped) Gold Standard: ""I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs, but I'm afraid that someone else will hear me."" I think this verse is the rest of the world. People HATE to admit FOB makes music that's good, even though its ""Pop"" and ""mainstream.""   3.) I hate the term selling out. I don't think FOB sold out for making more mainstream music. They want to make music that they enjoy, not for a specific group of fans.  To me, Novocaine has always been more about how they are ""numb"" to the haters and are going to enjoy life with their actual fans."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,IrishBro17,3,Sun Jun 21 16:17:46 2015 UTC,All of this yes ^
FallOutBoy,3alwou,pixees,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're trying to appeal to bigger audiences by going the poppy mainstream route, but the fans that have been around since the beginning, since they were underdogs (i.e. The fans who claim they've sold out) would rather they remain in the shadows somewhat.  So then the band has this dilemma: gain more fans on a bigger scale, or cater to the people supporting us by doing the same old boring thing? They lose either way."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,DaxEPants,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think what they meant by saying Folie doesn't have a distinctive sound is that every song on the album is so different. Albums like FUTCT or SRAR have pretty distinctive sounds, and the songs follow similar themes. Folie has songs with heavy synth, some with heavy elements of rock, and then there is 20 Dollar Nosebleed which has none of that. It's a sort of bipolar album - unable to have one distinct sound. I love it though."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,sara_c,4,Mon Jun 22 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"People need to remember this: Fall Out Boy is the brainchild of four very different artists. Pete is influenced by hip hop and electronic music, Patrick is influenced by R&B, and Andy and Joe are influenced by Metal. The guys obviously have similar interests and musical inspirations, but they also each have something unique to bring to the table. So you know, maybe when their artistic ability collides, you get a pop masterpiece."
FallOutBoy,3alwou,sara_c,0,Mon Jun 22 01:46:18 2015 UTC,"It makes sense. They said they do t make music for their fans, they do it for themselves, but then then hey go with a more popular and generic sound."

You just get your picture taken with FOB, and then you are mailed an autographed poster. So the answer to your question is no. However, I, along with many other fans are very upset about this.

FallOutBoy,3a7hiz,20dollar_nosebleeed,3,Wed Jun 17 23:35:25 2015 UTC,super jealous. report back with how it goes if you can get there?
FallOutBoy,3a7hiz,trelanity,2,Thu Jun 18 00:14:31 2015 UTC,Will do!
FallOutBoy,3a7hiz,20dollar_nosebleeed,-1,Thu Jun 18 18:31:35 2015 UTC,I'm going. I'm thinking of possibly camping out for this.
FallOutBoy,3a7hiz,HazelAugust24,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:30:16 2015 UTC,It might be necessary. I was originally thinking of getting there at 6am. But then I thought about it more and there only letting 50 people into the signing. That's really not a lot compared to the amount of people that will be waiting. PM me about it! I'm looking for someone to go with!

FallOutBoy,3a7bn9,thebestpartofbelieve,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:10:17 2015 UTC,I think if they're meet & greet tickets they can't be sold. Someone here might know for sure though...

FallOutBoy,3a39a9,sirthunt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:11:45 2015 UTC,I visited the Clandestine store in Chicago once. I was trying to find a hoodie and the dude behind the counter asked me if he could help. I said sure and told him I wanted this hoodie in a medium. They didn't have it and he asked me if I'd prefer it in a small. I was a small guy at the time and hadn't entered my scene phase so I responded no I wanted a hoodie that fit not one that made it so I couldn't breathe. He laughed and we joked about emo kids for a bit. He goes back to the counter but pops out a minute later and asks if I wanted to go to a party tonight. Angels and Kings was throwing some thing and lolla was going on to give a little context. Unfortunately I was only 19 and broke so I couldn't go get a fake Id. We joked a bit and I left only to read later the entire Decaydance group was at the party. I still kick myself for that one :-/
FallOutBoy,3a39a9,residualblues,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:21:15 2015 UTC,I always wanted to go to that store. Most of my Clandestine hoodies are so small on me now :/

FallOutBoy,3a2xso,alineinasong,0,Tue Jun 16 23:26:15 2015 UTC,You can maybe ask somebody if they are willing to sell theirs?   I actually couldn't even think of what you were talking about but duhhh it came in my ab/ap package lol   & like the other person said they are selling a flag for this tour! =)  I missed out on the monumentour flag (because it wasn't sold on tour at my date like it was supposed to be & only on that dumb app that they used to use =/ regretss) So I know how you feel!

FallOutBoy,39xwzh,nodaybut_today,8,Mon Jun 15 19:38:38 2015 UTC,'Be the colour of lightning' killed me. It's even better when you think about 'She's My Winona'.
FallOutBoy,39xwzh,MiserableNoMore,3,Mon Jun 15 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on the ""She's My Winona"" idea?"
FallOutBoy,39xwzh,cyanophobic,8,Tue Jun 16 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"Pete wrote 'She's My Winona' for Bronx and there's basically the line in the chorus that goes ""then came a baby boy with long eyelashes and daddy said you gotta show the world the thunder"".  Or people seem to think he wrote that for his son. I mean some say that song was written way long before Bronx was born. Basically we'll never know, because Pete likes people to put their own interpretation on FOB's songs."
FallOutBoy,39xwzh,nodaybut_today,2,Tue Jun 16 01:00:09 2015 UTC,"Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes/And Daddy said, 'you gotta show the world the thunder.'  One of my friends pointed it out to me. I think it makes sense."
