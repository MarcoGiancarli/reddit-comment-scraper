Leads sound almost identical, even though he has over ""300"" kicks he's still using the same sample in almost every single track. Haven't heard anything exciting from him for a couple of years.

hardstyle,3dsu4w,Abdissa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:41 2015 UTC,Dammit! That sucks. I hope they get a Defqon.1 going in the QSA pretty soon!
hardstyle,3dsu4w,PutMyDickOnYourHead,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt it. Many major festivals are struggling to stay afloat right now. To bring something that big and expensive to a niche market would be financial suicide. I don't think any company would allow that.  In the Netherlands and other countries, hardstyle and hardcore are pretty accepted and relatively popular, unlike the US market. The culture and vibes surrounding them is different too."
hardstyle,3dsu4w,zman0728,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would make more sense for Q-Dance to sponsor smaller tours across the U.S. Instead of putting in millions for a big festival with their incredible stages and production, spend a fraction of that on sending 3-4 big acts on a tour to 5-10 American and/or Canadian cities for shows similar to Wildstylez' Lose Control tour earlier this year.  Just my thoughts, I'm nowhere near qualified to speak of the financial logic regarding this subject though."
hardstyle,3dsu4w,PutMyDickOnYourHead,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is mostly ticket pricing. Ideally the tickets would need to be $20-$30. They could probably get a crowd of 1,000-2,000 on average. To put on a production of the scale they want, it would take a minimum of $20,000 in gear rental. Tack on travel for the gear (1-2 tractor trailers if using the same gear), artist and crew expenses (international flights plus domestic flights), promotion, and behind the scenes work, it would still be crazy. They would need to downsize their standards significantly.  I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say how much we pay headlining artists, but I'll say it's close to $4k each on average."
hardstyle,3dsu4w,dudeitspanda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"You seem well informed on all of this stuff (I've seen you post on here before regardless) but I am really bummed to hear this.  I was out of the U.S. for the better part of four years and right when I get back, Q-Dance is starting to pull out?  That is some of the worst timing a hardstyle fan like me could have :(.  I'm also kind of annoyed with Villain for feeding the ""Defqon.1 USA hype train"" that really shouldn't have been going in the first place (by the looks of it).  I'm as much an optimist as anyone but I cannot stand people gathering attention for things that are, simply put, too good to be true.    It is a relief that other companies have really stepped up since Q-Dance debuted at EDC a few years back.  I mean, in L.A. alone (the closest major city to me with semi-frequent events), there is FRESH Entertainment (still gutted I missed out on the G4H and Audiofreq show by a couple of weeks), Insomniac with the Basscon series of the events (really starting to compete with Q-Dance on stage/lineup quality for a standard midsize event), and of course, all the club performances, which is the vast majority of events I have attended.  Wrapping up my thoughts on the whole ""hardstyle expansion"" into North America, I could see Q-Dance coming back after a year or two once the scene develops a bit more.  Even if it doesn't, at least we will always have the smaller/midsize events to go to and, with enough patience/saving, there are now three Defqon.1 events, a plethora of other incredible summer events in Europe, and the biggest indoor events around in Qlimax, Hard Bass, and Reverze that are always safe bets for a great show (maybe even Qlimax will have a livestream this year!)."

hardstyle,3dpboz,Shake343,27,Sat Jul 18 05:30:26 2015 UTC,Amusing but not true.

He's there well before the doors open and continues doing his thing (whatever that thing is) throughout the day.
