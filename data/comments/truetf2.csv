Our scrims going in seemed to indicated an upward trend, and I took over main calling for the last scrim in which we won 6 rounds of 7 against another high ranked steel team. Match time came and our main scout was a no show, and we were playing with a different solly than for scrims. First half it seemed our combo was keeping up damage wise as well as frag wise with their combo, but flank was being overwhelmed all the time. Seemed we had very little flank control, as I was constantly having to take out one of the many players going in for our medic. Second half, our combo was just so overwhelmed by their constant flank pressure that just about everyone played a bad half. Not sure what to change up anymore, I'm feelin pretty salty. No, not even salty. Just kind of bummed."
truetf2,3e0ug2,TheYellowCellPhone,9,Tue Jul 21 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"4-1 (silver)  After one hell of a season where we started with pretty much a whole new roster and went through a lot of uncommitted or unable to play for various reasons players (we were up to our 3rd or 4th demo by the end), we finally found our groove. We started trusting each other and actually playing like a team. At one point we were really close to disbanding our team.  Our calls weren't incredibly cluttered, our flank combo worked well together, and we figured out how to actually coordinate between ourselves. I'm glad we stuck together, we learned a lot and each of us grew as better teammates. It's unfortunate that it took until the last game before we figured out how to play.  Good game today, Yeshihellohiteam. You guys put up one damn good fight.  Thanks for another great season Salty Sharks!"

Then our heavy/main caller had computer issues and we had to get a ringer. We got rolled in the first half with our demoman main calling. During halftime we all agreed that being passive was obviously a terrible idea so we went really aggressive. I started running widowmaker in order to get more into the action and got a few good med picks. We came back and got 2 rounds. Third round we weren't able to get though. Went to double overtime with them finally getting the point and barely pushing us off for long enough. We went 4-4 on the season which is better than most of us expected at the start since we were a team that assembled at the last minute and had a good deal of roster issues.

truetf2,3e0ug2,Iustinus,6,Tue Jul 21 13:40:38 2015 UTC,Come halftime everyone's morale was really low and without our maincaller everyone seemed lost so I decided to take a little more control and got everyone fired up to at least turn it into a game. It was a fun way to end the season and I really enjoyed playing against yall. GG's all around!
truetf2,3e0ug2,quartz174,8,Tue Jul 21 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"Lots to say about this game, but more about this season. Feel free to skip the last few paragraphs, writing this post is more for myself.  __  Is this 6s? vs. Egg Salad Dressing (us), NA Steel.  4-0 them, we got rolled, got a total of maybe four minutes of cap time across all four rounds. Third loss in a row, kind of saddening after a three winning streak at the start of the season. Well, I can't be bitter that the team we faced was leagues above us.  ESD has changed since pl_upward. Since then, we moved our Soldier to Scout, got a new Soldier, picked up a different Spy main after our first quit for personal reasons, and this game our Medic, (also our main caller, leader, and everything) was picked up by the team we faced at Ashville (Glamour Squad). I say with very little doubt in my mind that this is ESD's last season. Our Demo is quitting TF2 in general, our Medic is moving to Silver next season, and I'm sure most of us had our taste of comp TF2 enough to last us forever. Some of us want to be picked up by other teams in Iron or Steel or Silver, maybe as subs.  We also juggled a lot of people around. I moved to Engineer because we were planning on our Engie main to be busy for the match and because I think Engie on Lakeside is a lot of fun. Our Pyro moved to Sniper because he probably is just as good (if not a better) Sniper than I am, our Engie main actually could make the match and wanted to play Medic, a sub on Scout since our Scout is still on vacation, and we had a ringer on Pyro. Only our Soldier, Demo, Heavy, and Spy were on their mains. Would we have done better if our team was up to its full strength? Yeah, probably. Would we have done better if everyone wasn't offclassing? Maybe.  Missing your main caller, having everyone in roles they're not used to, and having to face the frightening amount of DM that 6s could dish out, obviously we got rolled. I think we had fun with it.  I don't blame our Medic for going to a higher Steel team. When he got the offer, we pushed him to go to that team, since we knew ESD was dissolving. He truly was one of the harder working people of this team, and I'm glad that he's going to playoffs next week. He would have rang for us for this match, but our Engie really wanted to play Medic, and he had his own team to play Medic on besides us.  And that concludes the season, folks, our first and last. A bunch of pubbuddies with a small interest in comp that was able to go 4-4 in Steel is pretty good. Across these eight weeks was probably the biggest improvement in my skill and game sense in TF2, I met a lot of extremely nice people on other teams who were humble when we beat them and courteous when they beat us, and made a few more friends. Only thing I really hated about this season was all the stress and jitters building up to each match.  People who are starting a HL team: have at least one sub for every position, preferrably someone who can play at a higher level on multiple classes, and definitely people who don't up and vanish. We had fifteen people on our roster at the end of cp_glassworks, and we still had to pull a ringer today. We didn't have a backup Demo or Heavy, I don't know what we ever would've done if either of them didn't show for a match.  Good luck to all teams going to playoffs next Monday. I'm just fine with not playing next week, and I know that every team who made it truly deserves it, even if most of you got carried by a Sniper.  Also we get cool badges in like two years when TF2 eventually remembers them."

To focus on our last match (which seemed to emphasize all of our worse traits).  It started off badly with not be able to play on our own server (in Dallas) and instead had to play in New York which hurt our little west coast team (I'm in MD so I wasn't hurt but 5 of our members were on the east coast). Once we got there our members were experiencing lag spikes and halfway through the 2nd? round 2 our members crashed and we had to pause.   On top of that one of members couldn't get in mumble without lagging, and several of the remaining members wouldn't stop complaining in mumble (I wasn't exactly peachy myself but I tried to at least keep it to myself.)

This was my second season in comp, first time putting together and leading a team. Since pre-season, I have lost five of my mains (some of them multiple times), it's been rocky and unstable and by about week 5 I was ready to disband us because it seemed like no one was having any fun and we weren't going to improve.  This weekend, we got utterly destroyed in a couple of lakeside scrims... And after some sourness was exchanged, that finally, finally seemed to make magic happen. By our second scrim on Sunday and pregame today, we finally entered the zone. Our comms cleared up. Our players played off of each other's picks, our combo became much more aggressive and vocal, finally allowing our medic to maincall more confidently because we were saying the things that needed to be said. Our rotations to respond to their positions were efficient and on-point, and just... This felt like playing on an entirely different team... I guess in some way it was.  We're out of playoffs, going 5-3 in the season, but I think for my first shot at leading a team and considering everything we've been through, it's been an amazing season that came to a very satisfying conclusion.

truetf2,3e0nb7,Arrythmia,8,Tue Jul 21 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"Frames are a huge factor in every game. It's how smoothly you see what's going on and can react to it. Fewer frames per second means a smaller chance of you noticing something when the shit hits the fan in a big firefight, and decreases your accuracy since you're skipping such huge segments of gameplay and mouse movement."
truetf2,3e0nb7,Iustinus,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:59 2015 UTC,ah. Thats what I thought so on the whole I haven't noticed a drop. I have frame drops when I also have chrome and all the extensions open. I usualy have about 30-50FPS which I had before (off the top of my head) so that probably isn't it. I don't mind low frames and if I can get skilled at low frames I can be better at high frames. Same thinking with ping.

truetf2,3e3qq9,skywalker096,6,Tue Jul 21 20:07:44 2015 UTC,Using the Amby sort of coaxes undisciplined spies into always trying for a head shot.

truetf2,3e3qq9,CQH,9,Tue Jul 21 20:31:49 2015 UTC,Then the downside is people who don't have good game sense or know how to look at an enemy's health?
truetf2,3e3qq9,skywalker096,3,Tue Jul 21 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"It's also that the damage and shot speed penalties on the amby arent that significant when it comes to shots to kill on enemies. Laughably stupid is a bit of an overstatement though, IMO :)"
truetf2,3e3qq9,Stevepander,3,Tue Jul 21 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah. Even if you only go for body shots it's pretty similar to the revolver, with the added bonus of a headshot if you're either good enough or lucky."
truetf2,3e3qq9,skywalker096,4,Tue Jul 21 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, and it also gives long range burst options to a primarily short/mid range class"
truetf2,3e3qq9,Stevepander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"Yes.  This is more common than you think :D  Also, Amby encourages new and intermediate spies to stand with the team and try to be a hero and land a headshot from across the map as opposed to cloaking and doing spy stuff."

truetf2,3e3qq9,Artisanpasta,6,Tue Jul 21 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"Tomislav is definitely not OP. You trade strong close-quarters pushes for slightly better ranged spam and better roaming. That, to me, is a fine trade-off and it's not more versatile than the stock. A combo heavy will almost always be more effective with the stock or the Natascha.  Loose Cannon, sometimes yeah. The biggest thing is that it can deal near-instant, undodgeable, non-direct >125 damage hits if you get good double donks. If a medic is walking with his team, the heavy can discourage soldier and scout picks, the pyro can block the spy, he can avoid sniper sightlines, but if he's taken even a sliver of spam damage he can be killed by a single double donk with the demoman taking almost no risk.  You trade some spamminess for this, and I consider a skilled cannon demoman to be more generally effective than an equally skilled pipe demo, but it takes a really high skill level for the difference to be noticeable and the difference isn't huge even then."
truetf2,3e3qq9,kierkkadon,9,Tue Jul 21 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"the loose cannon is no better than stock, and the slav doesn't really give a huge advantage to the point where it's op. if you say the slav is op, then in my opinion you have to also find the powerjack, escape plan, market gardener, degreaser and skullcutter op.  the loose cannon is really difficult to use well, and makes you even worse at self defense. Many demomen use it because they are constantly defended by scouts, but it's not a good choice for someone like kaidus because he's too aggressive. in my opinion, unless you're a god with it, stock is better 75% of the time."

truetf2,3e3qq9,Indivicivet,5,Tue Jul 21 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"Scotsman's skullcutter gives more damage than the stock, with the downside being reduced movement speed while active. Odds are if you're in melee range, they're not going to get out of range before you hit them."
truetf2,3e3qq9,Shady_Love,0,Tue Jul 21 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, they buffed it. I'd still say it's not an upgrade since it feels like 15% should still matter for hitting things, and doing more melee damage doesn't seem that important (I guess 2shots vs 3shots if you end up melee fighting a medic??), but I haven't used it since it got changed so I guess I can't claim for sure."

truetf2,3e3qq9,Shady_Love,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"Degreaser could do with a +10 ammo use on airblast or some other minor tweak to balance the switch speed, in my opinion."

truetf2,3e3qq9,Shady_Love,5,Tue Jul 21 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that'd also be fun. But it would make stuff like back burner and phlog that much stronger; coming up with a different, fun gimmick to the degreaser would be very challenging as well."
truetf2,3e3qq9,Stevepander,5,Tue Jul 21 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"The back burner and phlog's downsides are too strong for them to be a universal go-to. It would definitely be welcome to see more use of other flamethrowers. Hardest part will be giving the degreaser a new thing, but I doubt everything has been explored with only 3 flamethrowers."
truetf2,3e3qq9,Shady_Love,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"Phlog has no airblast yet it's already viable in settings where you just don't care and run in like a madman after setting up a flank. Backburner with 65% switch speed could probably be ran full time on 5cp and koth maps were multiple airblasts don't matter so much. Stock would just be a degreaser with some extra damage (and an Australium version, yay). I don't think adding switch speed as a passive is a way to go about it. I'd like to see more choices, sure, but they'd have to be some pretty amazing primaries to replace the ability to get the maximum potential out of any pyro secondary that the degreaser provides."

The worst part is if the cunt hits you with a double donk and you surf, you generally go up and are quite likely to crater as you come down with 10hp. Also the fact that it's borderline fire and forget to get a free kill. Fire one up into cheese on gully as you retreat, get at least 1 free kill???  Like I totally understand the tradeoffs, at mid he has to get much closer to do dmg consistently - our scouts can shred him there, right?

To me this is the major downside to the Tomislav, at medium-long range you have good ""annoying"" damage, but once you are forced with mowing down multiple targets, or a single heavy, at a closer range you begin to see why it is arguable that it is better to use stock."

truetf2,3dxn7e,silver_nuke13,41,Mon Jul 20 16:09:46 2015 UTC,Did you start both rev'ed up? That's another advantage the Tomislav has.  Heavy v. Heavy is also one of the most irrelevant parts of playing heavy anyways.
truetf2,3dxn7e,MrDoomBunny,16,Mon Jul 20 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yep.   The reason we both start revved up is that no one's contesting that Tomislav could win if two heavies encounter each other while both are ill-prepared, or that the silent spin up is nice. How much better Tomislav is at longer ranges (if at all) is what's been up for debate."
truetf2,3dxn7e,BluntTruthGentleman,10,Mon Jul 20 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"A week ago another guy did a more comprehensive test in this sub.    He confirmed what you just said, and frankly what you should've said in your initial writeup; that when spun up at the same time, the slav beats the minigun at almost every range."
truetf2,3dxn7e,Kered13,0,Mon Jul 20 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"That is the exact opposite of what AFlyingNun said, unless you have a typo in your post or something. FlyingNun said this:   There's no clear advantage that Tomislav provides over a stock Heavy at any range when fighting another Heavy.    And he clarified afterwards that he meant when both are spun up ahead of time."
truetf2,3dxn7e,BluntTruthGentleman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:20:22 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand.  In my response above yours, I emphasized the word just to illustrate that what he had just said in his previous comment (not his thread text) corresponded with previous testing.  This is the sentence of his that I was referring to;  ""The reason we both start revved up is that no one's contesting that Tomislav could win if two heavies encounter each other while both are ill-prepared""  End result: if both spin up at the same time, the slav wins at every range except close (the previous test, not aflyingnun's).  AFlyingNun tested it differently, with both starting already spun up, placing the minigun just ahead of the slav at all ranges except long range.   So between aflyingnun and the previous slav vs minigun thread we now we have a good understanding of which weapon will win where, spun up and not spun up :)"

truetf2,3dxn7e,cortanavicortania,2,Mon Jul 20 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"It is lol. I mostly perceive it as a team v team battle-- if both Heavies know what they're doing, odds are they'll be at maximal damage and accuracy outputs, and thus will deal close to the same amount of damage. If not for latency/cover, the team determines the victor."
truetf2,3dxn7e,tatonnement,2,Mon Jul 20 12:06:25 2015 UTC,"heavy v heavy matters in silver and below, but gold+ heavies are smart enough not to go seeking them out."
truetf2,3dxn7e,fireshaker,16,Mon Jul 20 23:30:45 2015 UTC,"you have to keep in mind that you're playing with ideal 1v1 situations with both heavies on generally even grounds outside of the guns.  firing rate is basically the only difference between the two at that point.    you'll usually be taking in a ton of factors whenever a heavy is present so the heavy vs. heavy solo fights aren't as frequent.  and generally something extreme has happened to have that become a situation.    as it stands, the accuracy boost of the tomislav is going to be the main gun for many situations since a lot of the fights you would generally find yourself as a heavy would be short-mid range.  as for scouts or others that get in too close, it's almost no difference between stock and tomislav.    what i would like to see though is a Time To Kill (ttk) numbers between the two guns.  as positioning is key for heavy, all of those tests would be good knowledge when developing the meta with the new gun changes    as for what's personally most effective, if you're able to play your best with a certain gun, i don't see why you should stop using it.  if it helps the combo's play style, go for it.  you can always change."
truetf2,3dxn7e,13_Polo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:45 2015 UTC,"I wrote this just after the heavy nerf a while ago, using data from before the nerf. However, I'd imagine that it remains fairly relevant:  Well I don't know about after the minigun nerf, but before it if you work out the numbers for the stock and Tomislav, given that situation, the two are almost exactly the same, disregarding the Dalokah's bar. Stock does 520 dps so takes around 0.577 seconds to kill a heavy at 300 health. The tomislav does 450 dps so takes 0.667 seconds to kill a heavy at 300 health, but the faster spin up time adds on .1 second of firing time. So overall the comparison is tomislav 0.567 and stock 0.577. But the likelihood of two heavies spinning up at the exact amount of time is minimal, meaning whoever shoots first will win (unless it's within 0.01 seconds...). Tomislav extra rev speed is therefore fairly irrelevant in this respect.  EDIT: Repost from my comment above, but you asked for Time To Kill numbers so I thought I'd reply to you as well. I'll try to come up with some more up-to-date data soon but I'd imagine the results will be more or less similar. The increased rev time from the new update will only add on another .1 of a second"
truetf2,3dxn7e,cortanavicortania,6,Mon Jul 20 22:32:27 2015 UTC,"Tomislav is great for handling individual target at mid to close range. Its reduced spread makes stock infinitely superior to it when it comes to handling multiple targets, since stock is way more consistent and more reliable. I was suspecting that stock would win anyway at close range since at this range hitboxes are already all over your face and it's very hard to miss, though it's interesting to see the result of mid-long range according to your post. A big deciding factor here would be the love and war nerf, whoever has a superior damage output will win. Accuracy matters very little at close range, especially with the tomislav's reduced spread, and minigun fires faster = higher damage at close range.  Though tomislav still has its uses (on ashville per instance, where most if not all fights are mid range and there are lots of 1v1 occurences, where the tomislav really shines), I think stock outclasses it almost everywhere. That doesn't mean that a tomislav heavy can't beat a stock heavy; it just means they'll have more difficulty in doing so.  Its faster revving speed is hardly, if ever a gamechanger. 0.87s = normal revving time. Add to this 80 milliseconds, since the brain takes that amount of time to process all incoming information, that's 0.95s. (ignoring latency)  However, tommy's revving time = 0.696 (0.87 x 0.8 + 0.08=0.776s. Almost 200 ms less than the minigun when both are at relatively low latency. It doesn't make much of a difference, but still food for thought."
truetf2,3dxn7e,iNeroSurge,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:20 2015 UTC,"I recall that when Tomi was 10% faster, it was barely a bonus worth mentioning at all. Now at 20%, it should be able to edge out against stock if two Heavies meet each other by surprise, but it's still close enough that it could depend on who reacts faster. If anything I'd say that bonus to Tomi is more about counter-acting it's slower firing speed to break even vs. another Heavy rather than winning out reliably.  But yeah this is something I wanted to test because while I'd agree the Tomi seems great on maps like Ashville, I've actually been encountering Heavies using it on maps like Upward, where you expect to go toe-to-toe with the enemy Heavy pretty frequently and the range you fight at is typically closer.   Another one I should really test is Natascha, just to get an understanding for how big the damage gap is in a Heavy vs. Heavy fight since one has superior damage but the other offers superior defense. Stock should win, but I'd like to see for myself just how big the gap is."

This would need to be a somewhat longitudinal analysis as this week vs last (to be extreme about it) would not substantiate that claim.  Though -- tomislav makes heavies be able to hold positions and stay spun up which would surprise the enemy team. Meaning you get more kills or damage since people now walk into you, whereas with stock they'd hear you a mile off. For example, last week in a match on swiftwater you can see where our heavy held and he got a lot of nice work done because people didn't expect him to be there. So if he did have higher DPM, it would be more to do with the silence of the spin rather than dmg/accuracy stats."

Another little ""buff"" that is only due to the pre-fire deal with heavy is that, since you have a slower firing speed, you waste less ammo getting to max damage, since you'll shoot less pellets in that second.  Ambushes are WAY more viable to get your combo out if you all get caught out, you can deny soldier/demo bombs just as well, and, if you play the range game, you can win almost any Heavy 1v1 against Stock (unless he goes into it with a massive adv, i.e. full prefire, hard tank, etc.)  It IS more punishing for players with poor tracking, but if you have solid aim, you get rewarded with minimal downsides."
truetf2,3dxn7e,Mostdakka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"Its faster revving speed is hardly, if ever a gamechanger.   Doesn't the +accuracy and faster rev time counter the delayed accuracy miniguns have now to a degree, since you spin up faster and start with more accuracy?  Or I assume its always +20% accuracy and not +20% accuracy once fully revved. So wouldn't that mean it only takes .55s to get to normal minigun accuracy (if it takes .696 second for full accuracy, it would only take .55s to get to 80% accuracy, but the Tomislav has an innate +20% accuracy so it doesn't need to get to 100% to be equally as accurate as the minigun)?"
truetf2,3dxn7e,tatonnement,4,Mon Jul 20 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"Your test doesnt mean anything, there are almost never heavy vs heavy fights when both are full hp, there is always someone with the heavy to focus his target down. Tomislav is better and more practical cause it helps with focusing targets - someone got lit? Now you have extended range to help with cleanup. Raw damage doesnt matter really cause demo will do most of it anyway, you just have to finish his targets and punish everyone with your extended range."

truetf2,3dy26e,Iustinus,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"right, but we already have the kunai and the big earner for that type of gameplay. The old DR opened up a different playstyle: maybe I will take a few aggressive shots on an enemy before feigning (forcing them to retreat). There was a risk/reward balancing that needed to be done against decent players (can I hold off feigning to take another shot?). Post patch DR basically incentivizes immediately feigning because letting your health drop below 60-75 is basically asking for death. The resulting play style is just a less fun version of the invis watch, where instead of cloaking behind the enemy, you just instantly feign and run away somewhere. Sure you can spend 60-80% of your time running away, but I could have just been running invis and getting in position by that point. It's a sloppy change, and I'm pretty sure time will bear me out on this one. Come back after a year and see if any spies want to run the thing."
truetf2,3dy26e,OverlyReductionist,7,Mon Jul 20 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"The big earner is reliant on actually getting the pick, if you miss it (or are more pistol oriented) the knife has no upside.  The kunai does let you tank damage, but only after getting a pick. Once again, if you miss it or are pistol oriented the knife has no upside.  The DR is for when you realize you've missed an opportunity or when you are running pistol & need to get away. Having a higher gamesense & realizing you need to get out sooner than you used to is very important. You can no longer run around like you have 400 health."

truetf2,3dx1uj,RK0019K,3,Mon Jul 20 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"Any sniper worth their beans knows where your hitbox is, regardless of hats. Some unusual effects can frame your head, which could make it easier for them, but not considerably. The biggest impact comes from you being more notable to the peripheral vision of every other player.  What I mean by that is: an undisguised spy could conceivably slip by someone even if they enter the person's field of view. Things get crazy, they have other stuff to be paying attention to and sometimes the environment is in favor of the spy blending. If the spy's head is glowing and on fire though, that's a different story. He's not getting into anybody's field of view without being instantly spotted.  EDIT: Slightly unrelated, but it's also worth mentioning that if a team's two scouts dress identically, they can get a slight advantage from that. Scouts are so fast and so capable of seeming like they're everywhere, it can get tough to keep track of them if they both look exactly the same."

truetf2,3dvvg6,RoboLegGaming,28,Sun Jul 19 23:33:43 2015 UTC,"While everyone here is rather creative with their suggestion, I think everyone knows what the true answer is.   No class restrictions means every single team is going to run a mix of medics and demomen, because they are hands down the most powerful classes in the game. The class balance would probably be 30%-40% medics and 60%-70% demomen. The reason it's only demomen out of the power classes is because of his hilariously high damage output, and the fact that demomen get stronger in numbers. If there are 6 demomen on a team, that mean that there's a maximum of 48 atickies out at a time. This, combined with a barrage of pipes will deny any class trying to get close, including the demomans #1 counter, the scout.  Sticky sniping will also be incredibly easy when there is 6 of them at once instead of one.  The gameplay would be incredibly fucking stalematey. No team would ever be able to push because of 12 possible sticky traps (assuming 4 stickies per trap) and we will see games that just boils down to who can spam the enemy team the best. Medic picks also wouldn't be worth shit because once a medic is dead there are still 3 others left.  TL;DR: 4 meds 6 demos because 6 demos eliminates his weaknesses. gameplay would  be stalematey as fuck"
truetf2,3dvvg6,123xxx321,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"I am not confident that a medic, scout, sniper team would not beat this especially if you mixed ubers and quick fix for the no knock back."
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"This counters everything. I'm not going to explain why again, just read the discussion between me and roboleggaming."
truetf2,3dvvg6,123xxx321,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:48:18 2015 UTC,Your previous discussion hardly covered all the possible situations. Clearly there is a degree of map dependence.  On an open enough map obviously snipers will beat demos. To take it to the extreme no peaking needed on an infinite sized perfectly flat no cover map. Some tf2 maps are open enough that it is pretty obviously worth it to replace one demo with a sniper.  There is also a nasty duel scout stratedgy with bonk. As you come out of bonk you click your mouse as fast as you can to basically garantee one meat shot. If two scouts do this you get a garanteed instant kill if not knocked back.  The scouts will have better timing than the sticky bomb det.  The only real defense is to try to have each demo place a sticky trap around the other demos to juggle the bonked scouts. I think it would end up being terrain dependent again for who would come out on top. With enough vertical space it would be hard to stop the duel meat shots from bonked soda popper scouts doing their duel shot in mid air.   How effective juggling would be would be highly terrain specific.   Of course this is all hypothetical no one is going to convince anyone without data which is sorely lacking.
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"As you come out of bonk you click your mouse as fast as you can to basically garantee one meat shot. If two scouts do this you get a garanteed instant kill if not knocked back. The scouts will have better timing than the sticky bomb det.   So... two scouts bonk in and manage to guarantee an instant kill on one demoman, or one medic. At that point they become two scouts with no secondary weapon against all of the other demos and medics. I would hesitate to even call that a strategy, because one spy can guarantee one instant kill a hell of a lot better than two bonk scouts."
truetf2,3dvvg6,Stormwatch36,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:46 2015 UTC,Remeber though you can simultaneously soda pop and bonk. Assuming the map has enough vertical space and cover of the right height there would be no way to get them. Timing an air det would be extremely difficult. The scouts would just get away.  A spy would not kill even one demo. Decloke  is not instant. The demos would have enough stickes that if they were smart they would sticky trap each other.   I still think the games would stalemate on most maps but on say a 5cp the mixed scout/sniper/medic/demo team would probably get 3 of the 5 vs a medic demo team.
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"Eh... I'm with /u/123xxx321 on this. All the medic/demo team has to do is deny the enemy until they build up their four ubers, then they can steamroll.   Think of what it would really take to make a dent in an 8 demo/4 medic team. Even if all the medics went with a stock uber (unlikely- they'd have at least one kritz at minimum), that still means ubers for days. Constant ubers, all the time. You pop yours, they pop one to counter it, and then they still have three more waiting. Aside from that, can you imagine what sixty-four stickies looks like? There's only so many places to lay traps, and they aren't going to toss them in random directions when those places are full, they're going to make bigger and wider piles. Your team is not going to get anywhere. Any one of their traps would be able to bash your medic's face through the skybox, and that's with only two or three of them right clicking."
truetf2,3dvvg6,Stormwatch36,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:40 2015 UTC,But you would also be facing a team of 4 medics and 5 or demos just with some extra scouts/snipers. Scouts can kite ubers indefinitely with bonk and speed. Demos have not way to avoid the scout ubers except knock back. This is probably enough to stop a push but it is not going to allow them to push either.  The demo team would end up losing the mid fight. 64 stikies is overkill. 40 is just as good but you get additional options with the other classes.
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"Which maps are open enough to replace a demoman with sniper? Competitive TF2 isn't about cp_orange and similar maps, and if a map is open enough to be worth using sniper, chances are it's not being played in this format.  Bonk scout strategy will not work. It's way too predictable and if it doesn't get stopped by juggling them when they come through choke, the hilarious amount of coordination needed to be able to pull of a double meatshot (which tbf doesn't even kill a demo, and a medic obviously won't let himself be meatshot) on the same guy doesn't make it worth it. Soda Popper is great n' all, but with 8 (not six) demomen spamming pipes at them, some of them are bound to hit eventually, killing/severely hurting them."
truetf2,3dvvg6,123xxx321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"Competitive uses different maps depending on the format. Who says you would not play on cp orange or more likely maps specifically designed to make 12 demos not worth it. 5s, 4s, and duo use completely different maps than 6s or highlander. Even on some current highlander maps though you would almost certainly replace a demo with a sniper.  It takes only a tiny amount of collaboration to do the double meat shot. If you bonk at the same time your shots will happen at exactly the same time. Sure there is a good chance the scouts would die but depending on the type of map and spawns it would still be worth it.   Also remember how uber timing works. Ubered demos would need multiflashed as they would need to sticky jump to catch the scouts. This would limit the uber length. Ubered scouts can chase demos alone."
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"And just how do you think the scouts are going to 'chase' without getting bounced away?  The demos dont need to sticky jump to chase the scouts. They can just move as a team and demolish anything that comes within medium range. This forces scouts to stay at long range, making them very ineffective.  Also: cp_orange will never, ever be played in comp."
truetf2,3dvvg6,123xxx321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"cp_orange will never, ever be played in comp.   12 v 12 no class restrictions would never be played in comp either unless valve really changed the game. This is an entirely hypothetical situation which is why I think it is non obvious what the strategy would be. There are too many unknown variables.    And just how do you think the scouts are going to 'chase' without getting bounced away?   quick fix. Or b  soda popper so they don't get hit. Also just because you can put out 64 stickies does not mean you can maintain that. If you det you have to re put them out.  Again obviously map dependent unless there is enough space their will be stickies everywhere. Speaking of medics too if you know there is only explosive damage no reason to even run a normal medi gun you might as well use the vac and quick fix instead. You would be not be killable and be unbounceable."
truetf2,3dvvg6,lonjerpc,-2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"There is one problem with your assumption:  There aren't that many good demomen in the world.  Demo and Medic are two classes that are completely different from the rest. Playing with stickies is completely different than all the guns, rocket launchers, knives, flamethrowers, and so on.  All other classes need to click on the right spot in the right moment to kill someone.  But stickies are different. First you click on the right spot. Then you click again in the right moment.  For people who play a lot of demoman it sounds easy, but for many players it's very difficult. All our platinum scouts, snipers, heavies, pyros, ... Most of them would be way more effective as their main class than as a demoman.  Sure, after a few years most people would learn to play demo because it has the most potential. But in the beginning there just wouldn't be enough good demos to put 6 on each team, so we would see a variety of other classes instead.  And a good spy could do a lot of damage to a team with only demos and medics, since there are no hitscan or fire classes to deal with spies."

truetf2,3dvvg6,PineMaple,13,Mon Jul 20 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"While on an individual level, 1 scout would be able to beat 1 demo with ease, the issue with stacking demos is that you can have overlapping sticky traps. Multiple demos can punch far above their 1v1 weight, to the point where I'd pick a team of 8 demos over a team of 8 scouts every time. Plus it's going to be hard for a sniper to get a shot off when you have 8 demos spamming pills at the only viable sniping positions. Anything that tries to get through a choke is going to be mulched, heavies and pyros don't stand a chance. A spy might have a chance at getting through but that's not going to serve as a hard counter. Maybe if you were playing a super open map like cp_orange could the snipers/scouts do work, but the majority of maps played in comp have something like 2-3 routes for each point, and 8 demos could hold those with ease."

truetf2,3dsagh,metawe,3,Sat Jul 18 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Hey metawe, thanks for doing these vids. Big fan.  In our most recent scrim on lakeside, we tried following this advice. We had our whole team rollout to the midfight through main and commit to the point together (we tried to, I'm not 100% sure our whole team committed) - but we just run into the wall of heavy/demo spam and our flankers can't get damage on the enemy. Then because we're in a stalemate with their combo trading spam, their pyro/scout/soldier have taken bathhouse and are flanking us, dealing direct damage from behind while we're focused on the enemy combo. We were never able to push through the spam we were receiving, and so having extra teammates in the combo fight didn't help.  Do you have any advice for this situation? Should we just be able to dm our way through the combo fight? It doesn't really make sense to me to have the scout and pyro commit to that fight, they can't get across the point to get damage on the enemy combo."
truetf2,3dsagh,kierkkadon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah usually what you need is someone to initiate the push or distract. I covered this during the soldier stuff I actually forgot to put into the video, but the most effective way to just push across the point is to have the soldier bomb above the combo (not necessarily into them, he can land on bats or above main for example) and have your team push across point. The scout is there to follow up on any damage your demo is doing as he is the class that can do that the fastest. If your soldier died early or doesn't have enough health to jump, you can still just coordinate a push across point and to the side of point while everyone focuses on the people on the grass area (right behind the wall on their side of point). Sending people both ways should allow you to outnumber them if they send multiple people bathhouse. You should note though that this has to happen quickly once you notice there are multiple people going bathhouse, as the longer you wait the more chance you are giving them of flanking you and pinching you if their combo pushes point."

Sounds like the classic ""he's better than me so he must be hacking"" butthurt. That being said, make sure that you're absolutely certain he isn't, or he will be found out the second you guys start advancing. As for how, I admittedly don't know. But believe me, a serious opponent will be reviewing every match they play, including the ones against you guys. Eventually, something a hacking sniper did just wouldn't look quite right.  EDIT: I feel like I should explicitly say: if a serious accusation came up and put a close set of eyes on him, it's your job as his teammate to stand up for him if you don't believe he is hacking. If you didn't, your non-response would publicly equate to ""I don't know"", and that's not good at all. That's why I say you need to make absolute certain. Because if you all defend him and then it turns out he is, you're all screwed.

Higher levels not so much, because you figure someone else would've caught them by now, which is how they end up getting away with it for a while. With OP just getting started (I assume- if he has teammates who have never played comp at all), his sniper would be more likely to get caught just because at a lower level, he's more likely to run into people willing to call him a hacker."

As a team leader it's your job to review his demos whenever an accusation appears to make certain you're not jeopardizing  the season for everyone else on the team. If you find proof beyond reasonable doubt you should feel obligated to take it to an admin and remove him from the team as soon as possible. You WILL have defaulted losses for every single game he's played in should he be banned, which sucks, but the earlier it's done, the better it is for your team and the more likely you can recover from it.  If you don't find substantial proof/have a suspicion you can't confirm it's your call as to whether or not to remove him. Personally I follow ""innocent until proven guilty"", and believe that pressure from outside the team should have no weight in your decision. The latter is mostly because their opinions are almost always going to be less informed on the situation than you ideally should be. Since, if you're anything like me, will be reviewing every single game be it scrim or match to determine the risk your sniper poses to your team.  Interesting question. This reflects a situation I'm in, and it's quite frustrating spot. People will believe what they want to believe, and vilify you for taking a stance against them and sticking up for your players. It's irrelevant as to whether or not you spend hours poring over demos and they spend 5 minutes watching videos to come to drastically different conclusions.

truetf2,3drjsf,Pengn,11,Sat Jul 18 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how to respond to this without writing a massive essay.  So I'm sorry if you don't appreciate those.  Let me additionally preface this by saying that I played engineer in highlander for some 2+ years or something like that, and have done a couple video guides to that too, so I know the ins and outs of the class really well.  I understand that 6s is different in a lot of ways, but I'm pretty sure I've watched and played enough 6s that I understand what those differences are and specifically how they related to engineer.  (Also sorry if this is incomprehensible shit, I'm several days without enough sleep.)  I suppose you could tldr this by saying: if engineer is a good class, then why doesn't 6s run it all the time?  Sure, you can say that it's because the class is too slow to play on 5cp maps, but 6s runs koth maps on occasion too.  In highlander viaduct is probably the best and strongest engineer map.  In 6s - it's never even seen.  Even though scouts are crazy strong on viaduct, and sentries specifically counter them.  Even though bombs, and group bombs, are a common strategy, and sentries specifically counter that too.  Even though heavy - which is similar to a level 3 sentry in many respects - is often run.  Obviously going engineer when you don't hold the point is dumb, but when you hold the point and a player is spawning and you know the other team won't be pushing for another 30~ seconds while they wait for uber anyway?  It's because every other class is better in that situation than engineer.  The other classes - even heavy - can actually respond to things; engineer is worthless until the sentry gun goes up, and then worthless until it goes down.  Even then, the sentry isn't much better than an actual player.  Because yeah, it's an aimbot, but it's a stationary aimbot with limited range.  It's a stupid, predictable aimbot.  Heavy is easy enough to play that you can do pretty much the same thing with it, except you're also not completely immobile, you have higher base hp, you can be buffed, and you're a smart human player that can choose their targets, shoot at things outside of a limited range, and work with teammates.  The only downside to heavy vs a sentry is that the heavy dies for good, while the engineer can go back to scout or whatever.  But think about that; engineer's sole advantage in 6s is that you can draw 216 hp worth of focus fire and switch classes.  The thing that makes the class good is that you can switch to a better class.  I will grant you that because of class limits, if you want maximum tankiness for maximum turtle on a last point, then yeah, heavy + engie is usually the way to go.  Though honestly pyro with a buff has as much or more hp than a level 3 sentry, which I think it something that people forget, but pyro has its own problems too so whatever.  Engineer has a lot of core problems though.  The whole ""sentry is an extra player!"" thing is pretty overrated, actually, because that would require engineer on its own without a sentry to count as a full player to begin with, but in terms of combat and general usefulness engineer on its own is like the 4th valve server spy.  And sentries themselves have a lot of structural flaws, too, especially that they don't scale with skill whatsoever, which means that they get progressively worse as the skill level increases, pinning engineer into this place where it's only good against bad players.  Because they're stationary and have a limited targeting range and are pretty much just dumb robots, it's easy to exploit these weaknesses to destroy a sentry.  Sentries just don't do damage because they rely on people making bad decisions.  They can deter people from entering an area, sure, but it's probably overextending if you were going to do that anyway.  (Do they deter bombs?  Yes.  So do scouts and heavies and pyros.)  So pretty much all the sentry winds up doing is forcing people to focus it down first  But I mean, it's 20~ seconds of building to tank 216 hp.  Heavy can do better out of the gate.  Sniper forces an early uber and has the potential to actually get a pick before switching classes.  And that's not even getting into engineer vs the core 6s classes, which far and away outstrip it in every respect.  Is engineer a good class?  I don't know - but how many are objectively worse?  Also I'm pretty sure the jag is going to get banned for next season because it's so good now and effectively a straight upgrade."

truetf2,3drjsf,NinjaDerpy,3,Sun Jul 19 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought that was kind of implied, sorry.  But the thing is it doesn't take much focus fire to kill a sentry - if both soldiers and the demo each shoot it once, it's dead.  Plus usually the gun gets taken down during an uber exchange during which your team would have been fairly protected anyway.  Yeah, arguably you're forcing their uber early/getting the better half of the exchange, but a sniper/pyro would do the same.  Anyway my point is that you can hardly call engineer ""good"" when it's surpassed by every other class in everything but one situation requiring a portion of setup time no other class does in order to function.  Maybe I should have just said that."
truetf2,3drjsf,NinjaDerpy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:29 2015 UTC,"The reason engineer isn't played is because he's a complete wild card. In a game of chess, if the enemy has a strategy you didn't think of before and they play it out well before you see it, you're probably going to lose a bit of ground and possibly the whole match. Next time you play, however, you'll know of this strategy and can counter it.  You can't define a wild card as good or bad, simply because of the way it works. Of course engineer will suck at mid and doesn't have ultra firepower or speed from the get-go, but he's still unexpected. Even if the team sees the sentry, they'll still have to rethink their strategy. The sentry would be a distraction, cover, might get a kill which could turn the whole tide.  Engineer is essentially a slow scout that can build and heal heavies. He's got more firepower than speed, which isn't what 6s is, so I understand why he can't fit well. But his firepower makes him an unexpected strategy. When everything is going at top speed you don't notice the slow things.  The new changes to Engineer made him a much faster class. The Jag makes him build faster, he doesn't move as slow when hauling, etc. 6s is all about speed, and now he's a bit faster. If they ban the Jag then there's no way Engi could fit into any meta, but right now there could be strategies formed around it.  Even if engineer could never be in the meta, he will still be an obstacle to have to push through, along with the rest of your teammates and yourself when you switch to a more powerful class."

I'd be running back to spawn regardless. It's actually FASTER to get to my gun because I didn't have to walk to resup.   okay, and your gun went up literally 2 seconds slower   If you don't think 2 seconds is a significant amount of time, you don't play much 6s engineer. 2 seconds is the difference between having to settle for a level 2 gun and getting it up to a level 3 fairly often.  The guide is a guide for engineer in the context of 6s. In the context of 6s, engineer got buffed a lot. If you don't agree with that, I don't know what to tell you, honestly. Faster build speeds in 6s= better."

Also if you built a dispenser as well you wouldn't need to run back to spawn, and leave all of your assets unprotected, for more than two seconds.    2 seconds is the difference between having to settle for a level 2 gun and getting it up to a level 3 fairly often.   Yeah. And running back to spawn is also the difference between having a sentry, and sentry metal lying on the floor as it got destroyed while you were off changing wrenches.

It's still safer to build the gun up by building it near spawn and moving it after you build it, or else you might get caught over extended. If you have time to build up a dispenser in your nest, you are playing people that are waaaay too passive.   Yeah. And running back to spawn is also the difference between having a sentry, and sentry metal lying on the floor as it got destroyed while you were off changing wrenches.   Once again, I wouldn't have been close to my gun anyways because I had no ammo. I'm not about to slow down how fast I update my gun or take an extra trip to build a dispenser. The gun (even at level 3) is VERY disposable.   What you said was plain wrong and misleading at best.   If you somehow warp my intent to explain the class in 6s into trying to talk about engineer as a whole, it could potentially be misleading.

I've heard people say this, people who obviously have not played many games (officials or scrims, whatever -- just not pubs) as engineer. You literally have to change how you play now.

I can't remember off the top of my head but I think one version had tracking errors due to software faults but that only affected a tiny percentage, if you're going to get one you should look that up. It also has a dodgy scrollwheel (just unbind it from everything in game) and no side buttons but as a simple mouse it works well, I actually have one and used to use it and can vouch for its great sensor.

truetf2,3door6,SpaghettiJunction,18,Sat Jul 18 01:06:17 2015 UTC,"Everyone is giving pretty good general advice, but a few special new things to be aware of, the speed boost from backstab kills on the spy lets them move a lot faster than you think, and with that speed they can pull off ""trick""(read: bug) stabs.   By abusing the matador style side  stab but just using their movement instead of the turning of their target. Admittedly it does take a good bit of skill or luck for them to pull off.  With that said be careful of spies coming off a backstab, that movespeed bonus can get you killed, so lock on and don't flick/overtrack them if your close and want to avoid getting a ""backstab"" done on you.  Now onto the general stuff.   Map awareness: You have to be aware where spies can from, when they can get there and if they will go in for a stab, amby sniping (annoying but means less team pressure) or a revolver pick. Once you know that, and it changes map to map, and from when the spy's location was last called, you can get a second sense where and when they should appear. Damage resistance: Yeah the spies get some damage resistance now, the trick to killing them is to just keep shooting them until they die, it isn't that significant of difference when you look at how small their absolute health pool is. DM: Sometimes the spy might just have better movement and aim than you or your team, the only thing you can do here is focus fire, call properly before he gets a kill off, and improve. Not every class can properly deal with a spy in all situations, a clever one will abuse this to target flank or support players that are alone or unable to retaliate because of movespeed or low life (heavy/sniper). Map pressure: This is the big one, spies take advantage of openings or make their own, its much easier to take advantage than try to out DM much stronger classes than yourself. This means the spy player relies on map pressure like bombs, picks, movement, rotations, and pushes to strike. This means when you are boxed in and fighting on all fronts because your flank is overwhelmed the spy will find more kills, or when you are pushing onto a point and focused in front of you the spy will stab. This is all about recognizing when the spy will try to attack based off the situation and where from (for example, pushing viaduct point hard, look cliff/china for a jumping spy). This also means you have to play in a way that you can force them back and keep pressure off your team, its all about zoning, threat range, sight lines, and not overextending. In short it is the balance between passive and aggressive that works best for the map, and much like the meta it can change based upon many things.   ITT: Shoot the spy till they die, and then shoot them some more to be safe. Spy check and turn around a lot, and call when you see the spy or when it kills you, thats it.  PS: Sorry, I might of wrote a little bit too much."

Spies are very limited in exactly how they get behind you. Spycheck your entire team as much as possible, know where the spy is probably going to come from, and for chrissake if he does get someone, catch him before he gets another."

truetf2,3door6,AFlyingNun,2,Sat Jul 18 10:39:54 2015 UTC,"In general you want to know your maps inside and out. Spies have limited options to get behind your lines, so you can generally know where they're coming from and, if you pay attention to their respawn, roughly when they'll be in your territory again. Know what the spy's goal will be at any given time so you can gauge which area he'll be in. Knowing where medkits/ammo pickups are will allow you to predict the actions of a spy in distress.  Know your trickstabs as the spy does. You don't need to perfect them, but you need to understand how they work and why. Maintain healthy suspicion of your ""teammates"", don't leave any glaring openings for a trickstab and always take care when it comes to stairs, inclines and props.  As for the Ambassador, just try to avoid sightlines, be alert and don't create stupid openings. If you're desperate, you can always open fire to try and throw off their aim.  One off the most important things to remember when dealing with spies is to always check the ammo they drop when they die. Every time. Make a shot and reload if you have to, because it's important.  If you pick up the ammo pack and don't get ammo/metal, they used the dead ringer. If you do get ammo/metal, they're actually dead.  Also worth noting is that if you ""kill"" a DR spy, your kill count (and your sentry's kill/assist, if it got a hit in) won't go up and on-kill effects won't proc. If the spy was dominating you and you don't get a revenge kill on him, he used the DR. ""Killing"" a DR spy can sometimes trigger bugged (in other words, unearned) dominations/revenges as well.  A cloaked spy under the spy-cicle's active effect can still be tracked by fire; it makes a subtle, but noticeably different sound when it's hitting a player, even while cloaked and immune. Sadly, I have never been able to find a video showcasing this."
truetf2,3door6,FlakJackson,2,Sat Jul 18 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"Is this in public servers or in competitive? If in public servers, worry about what the spy will do that will actually influence your team's ability to win the match. Thing is, if your team is generally stronger than the other team, the spy getting some picks will not stop the flow of battle (I should know, it's my class). Stop the spy from doing things that will kill momentum (teleporters, killing medics, etc) and him getting flashy trickstabs on your worse players won't mean much. If you are having trouble dying to spies yourself, I would play classes or play styles that are tough for a spy to kill. I tend not to get lots of picks on gunboats soldiers, scouts, heavies that rotate/pivot often, etc. In the long term, I would recommend you try to learn how to play spy if you haven't already. Playing all classes at a fairly competent level will improve your gamesense because you will easily be able to pick out disguises.   If this is in comp, some of the same rules apply. Make sure you aren't placing too much emphasis on chasing the spy everywhere, but try to pay special attention at times when a big pick would really hurt your team.  As for gun-mettle specific changes, expect more invis watch spies because it got a buff. Invisible spies will be a bit tankier (but nothing too crazy). If the spy is a deadringer spy, make that first shot count! Deadringer only blocks 50% of damage when feigning, so a good rocket or pipe heavily cripples the spy. Also, the deadringer speed boost will mean the spy will move quicker following the feign, so he will be a bit further away than you are used to. Hope this helped somewhat."

truetf2,3door6,BadLaffs,2,Sat Jul 18 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound strange but back off. Practice your zoning and area denial. Probably the most important thing for spy is positioning for success. While acting (a skill that seems dead these days), trick stabs and head shots are all necessary for a kill, the spy can't do much if the spy can't find the right angle to attack from. Don't blindly chase a spy, cause they'll rely on the broken melee system. Keep your distance like any battle, but make sure you are directing the flow and the action. Remember your angle and sight lines and be unpredictable. Play at your own tempo."

That means you'll take longer to pull back to hold on process per instance, or that you'll have a slower combo overall. Some 5cp maps are easier to move on when you have GRU and your soldier won't always be there to whip you  • Decreases your odds of survival in case you just survived, let's say, a close encounter with their soldier or scout. You have nothing to heal yourself with, your medic is dead, so what do you do? Are you just going to eat the steak and run to a medkit? There are hundreds of possibilities when it comes to enemy positioning, and you could find yourself left too far behind your combo by the time your medic's up and running.  I don't know, I feel like it induces a more team-relying playstyle. I myself prefer FoS on payload most of the time, but I don't think BSS can be better than sandvich unless in temporary, time-limited scenarios that turn out to be at your disadvantage.

If you feel like you need to be there quickly you should just run GRU and make an effort to listen closely to comms (or get your team to improve them) so you can be aware if anything is behind and where you need to take the gloves off. FOS is sort of a crutch weapon in the sense that it lets you get out of bad positions (your own mistakes) because of the big damage resistance. There are a few occassions where you can use FoS for actual tanking (mostly headshots: to bait the shot so your medic can cross a sightilne, or to check for traps). GRU allows you to do more overall if you use it correctly but it punishes you more if you make a mistake."

truetf2,3dlrev,Medichamp,2,Fri Jul 17 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not the best sniper, I only have 400 hrs on the class overall, but what I can say with confidence is that I never had trouble landing a headshot on snipers c-tapping. You're as good as standing still if you jump, it's easy to flick to the head to me, but my sens is low as hell (400 DPI 2.05 windows mult. 1)  People would do it in the past because it was instant, like you take the shot and you instantly jump out afterwards, which would prevent any instant death after taking your shot. While things have changed and that nowadays you're going to want to crouch irregularly at certain moments, it doesn't work anymore, it works against you as a matter of fact if you're fighting a good sniper, because if you miss and you jump you're predictable as hell so anyone can flickshot you, I mean anyone who can land airshot headshots (which isn't THAT hard) because they're used to enemies jumping around and trying to mix their hitboxes.  Tl;dr no use jumping like a monkey it won't save you from losing your head to a good sniper"
truetf2,3dlrev,liuwqf,7,Fri Jul 17 09:52:54 2015 UTC,"OP doesn't mention jumping anywhere (except for that last explosive jumping bit), a c-tap is just the shortest possible crouch movement you can make"
truetf2,3dlrev,pink_rapefruit,5,Fri Jul 17 13:30:48 2015 UTC,Most snipers c-tap while jumping though. I'm aware of that but it's usually a c-tap jump that does in fact mix your hitboxes for whoever has been wondering. Difference is that a proper flickshot fixes that.
truetf2,3dlrev,liuwqf,5,Fri Jul 17 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"C-tapping is different from just regular crouch jumping (and crouching mid-air). C-tapping implies a very specific short timing where tapping crouch will move your hitbox slightly closer to the ground while your model is still standing, not even at the beginning of the crouching animation.   If you explosive jump while c-tapping your hitbox is closer to the explosion and because of how the engine works you gain more momentum.  I have not tested what the OP is asking though but it should work in theory. The thing is that your hitbox is different from your model for a very very short amount of time (I think it's something like 20 frames, which means something around 0.3s, human reaction time is around 0.2s for comparison) while c-tapping so it might come into play when counter-sniping, it could be useful to at least try."
truetf2,3dlrev,metawe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that. I try to always c-tap as solly and demo which made me kind of c-tap as every class, even when surfing as med I try to put that into practice if I catch a right angle. But even with all of that I doubt it's going to do any difference in sniping.  Let's say 2 experienced snipers go to MGE, they add badlands spire and they get on equal grounds. One of them misses then crouchjumps, or rather, in this case, jumps and c-taps while doing so. Do you realize how easy it is to land an airshot headshot most of the time? Just wait for your enemy to reach the peak of their height/momentum and quickly flick. At this point, the very short amount of time you speak of has faded away when I take the flick shot. Which is why most good snipers laugh at fakescopes and longscopes, you're as good as standing still if you're doing that, and even if you c-tap, most snipers take the shot when you're high up from your jump. Hell, I've gotten some silly picks over people crouchjumping that I wouldn't have gotten if they weren't crouchjumping, since they mixed their hitboxes and I caught a way to counter that; Take the shot early or take it at the peak of their momentum (the second option is mostly preferred, the first one rarely ever works and it would be a clutch shot if anything).  If you flick properly you will get the headshot, I've seen it in practice in MGE and lobbies, even pubs. Good snipers don't seek to fight each other like that, most snipers who do that are the ones that think that the whole class is about quickscopes without taking into consideration tracking, positioning (and re-positioning), that's why you see what I like to call a frog sniper jumping around the map seeking enemy snipers; You just take cover and time your shots against a good sniper (and good snipers are pretty much like ghosts, you never see them except in rare occasions and on the freezcam, as most establish an imaginary wall except if you jump then, and even then...)"
truetf2,3dlrev,liuwqf,2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree that good snipers can easily headshot players jumping. I meant that it might be useful without jumping, just c-tapping. C-tapping doesn't necessarily involve jumping."
truetf2,3dlrev,metawe,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, like that? If I can give you a tip, crouching irregularly throws off anyone's aim sniping-wise. If the sightlines are huge or if you're out of cover, you could do that, which is how I avoid getting headshot by most sniper offclasses in 6s. Always look out for dots on walls, if they stand out and are of different colors, crouch and stand back up directly, move irregularly and don't stay in one spot, crouchjumping is so old as good snipers can counter that.  Eh. C-tapping without jumping might work against some people but even when I do it without jumping I still get killed by some people I know (shout-out to my boiz)... some people are that good.  EDIT: If you ought to downvote, since we're in truetf2, let me know how I'm wrong because I could improve on your advice. Thanks."

I actually agree with you about the sandvich thing, anyone can easily grab it by mistake and it can just fuck things up to not have it available at any time, even with perfect comms you can't keep the enemy spy from grabbing it or keep mistakes from happening. Only good in a scenario where you need to keep your medic alive AND keep tanking at the same time, I'd only do it if I were sure the spy was dead and I knew the medic would need it soon.  I think you're also right when it comes to the tomislav, since you can still harass enemies a lot and you'll be close to the point most of the time, but I still feel like stock comes very close to it since it allows for more mistakes compared to the tomislav. Natascha's definitely an interesting weapon choice if you want to play more defensively and it can even beat stock heavies (though I'm not quite sure if it can do it consistently) when both are @ max accuracy and damage ramp. I really like the new tomislav and the difference is easily noticeable, definitely a very good weapon if you can track consistently but it's nowhere as forgiving as its faster stock counterpart, and I don't really know about how efficient it can be in stock v tomislav encounters. I'd love to see a video depicting damage numbers of stock, tomislav and natascha against buffed heavies wielding the very same weapons, to compare damage numbers.

I fixed it by using mouse acceleration. I'm probably going to be downvoted for saying this but mouse acceleration is actually good if you use it correctly. Quake Live players use mouse acceleration and for good reason: Their game has like 900 commands to tweak the acceleration to their liking. I cannot think of a single Quake Live player who has won a major tournament and doesn't use Quake Live's mouse acceleration commands, and top players in that game have pretty godly aim.  Just whatever you do DON'T USE THE IN-GAME MOUSE ACCELERATION IT'S TERRIBLE. You should instead use povohat's mouse acceleration driver to achieve this which you can find here  I know this takes up a good bit of your time but if you still think mouse accel is bad take a look at these videos in this playlist. They explain how it's actually good and can help your aim/how to use this driver.

The in-game acceleration is tied to your framerate, so whenever it fluctuates, it screws up your aim. Povohat's driver doesn't do that.  Acceleration lets me play every class with the same settings. (I even play CS:GO with the same settings.)  Imagine using the same sensitivity for Soldier, Scout, and Sniper. Imagine playing Ambassador Spy and being able to move effectively while still being able to headshot people from long-distance. It doesn't work without acceleration.

Trust me, I've looked. It's really impossible because there are wildly varying attitudes in the greater TF2 community about how a pub should be played, and in a publicly available server, you're always going to get people from one end of the spectrum or the other.  Some people suggest STAR's server, but even that won't get you there. His server in my experience is kind of a unique situation, because he's got some semi-competitive settings built in (class limits, some weapon bans, etc), which attracts better players, but then you've got the people who are there just to, how do I put this nicely, goof off with other goofy STAR_ fanboys. So really the skill disparity there is even greater than your average pub.  Otherwise you've got what other people have mentioned, PUGs for newbies, and lobbies.

truetf2,3dlczx,SpaghettiJunction,43,Fri Jul 17 05:13:32 2015 UTC,It punishes people for doing something as simple and useful as jumping (pressing space) because of its mini crit mechanic. It is very unfun to play against and it does not even require you to play a different way than you would with flare/shotgun; it's still airblast + shoot a player that can't even move (the main reason people find pyro annoying).
truetf2,3dlczx,metawe,18,Fri Jul 17 05:32:24 2015 UTC,It is like a hitscan flaregun with multiple shots and quicker switch time. It's pretty retarded to play against.
truetf2,3dlczx,0Valkyrie0,-2,Fri Jul 17 13:45:01 2015 UTC,"It punishes people for ... jumping    I have never liked this argument. The sniper punishes people for walking in his line of sight, the pyro punishes you for getting close to him, ect. You know what people say to this? Stay out of his sight line, don't get close to a pyro... that is the advice people give... but dare anyone give the advice ""don't jump""? No, they don't. /endminirant  Srry, it's just, no one complains about it on soldier. If mini-crits against jumping players was the real issue then we would see complaints across the board not just on pyro. The problem is the degreaser not the RS. (not dismissing the fact that the RS is flawed though)  Edit: I know rants tend to naturally get downvoted but should someone feel like explaining a different view on the matter it would be nice..."
truetf2,3dlczx,CrypticMonk,15,Fri Jul 17 06:45:33 2015 UTC,"mini-crits have no damage falloff so RS's effective range is huge against someone who is jumping.  Being punished for jumping while half-way across the map from the pyro is ridiculous.  Plus long range shotgun shots are easy to hit compared to sniper headshots.  No one complains about RS on solly because in HL gunboats are too good not to run (except in certain situations with the conch) and in 6's its banned.  Not going to downvote btw, its your opinion and as long as you're not flaming while expressing it you are entitled to it."
truetf2,3dlczx,Malice74,0,Fri Jul 17 07:39:15 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the reply.  I much prefer this argument against the RS as opposed to ""it punishes for jumping"". As I stated earlier the RS is flawed but not because it punishes jumping, but (as you pointed out) because the bonus dmg is mini-crit dmg. Imo it should be a flat %50 dmg bonus to airborne opponents but that is neither here nor there.  As far as balance on soldier is concerned you say people don't complain about it because of the way comp format works but this thread, I'm sure, is not just comp players and everyone (save for I think one comment I spotted) seem to think it's pretty well balanced on the soldier, some even saying it's underpowered."

Or that's my two cents anyway."

As I said, the problem is not the RS (though it has it's flaws) the problem is pyro, or more specifically, the degreaser+airblast.   it should be at most 30% damage bonus to people that you knock into the air.   That could work well in combination with with lessened fall off dmg to keep it relevant, perhaps even increasing the switch to speed to %40ish (won't matter for pyro) to buff it a little for soldier?"
truetf2,3dlczx,CrypticMonk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you avoid sniper sightlines you will not take any damage (from the sniper) and very likely will live. If you don't jump the pyro can still shoot you for the normal shotgun damage and kill you. If you try to jump to surf bullets away (something you can do against any other weapon) you will die.  RS on soldier requires you play differently by actually bouncing people into the air then RSing them, soldiers don't have such airblast. It is extremely rare for someone to actually do this even in pubs since regular shotgun is better in most situations to finish off the kills.  The real problem with pyro is airblast because of how frustrating it is to play against, but it is very unlikely that valve will change it."
truetf2,3dlczx,metawe,0,Fri Jul 17 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"People bitch about it on pyro because it's so easy to stop your whole momentum and hang you in the air. Take into consideration that even if soldiers ran the RS you have the switch speed with the degreaser and RS on Pyro that allows any jump to be sanctioned. And it's easy as hell to airblast someone in the air. Blasting someone in the air with a rocket, e.g properly aiming it at their feet is easy but less than pyro. And nobody does that anyway."

truetf2,3dlczx,Kairu927,-5,Fri Jul 17 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"And if you were a scout you wouldn't have needed the weapon swapping at all, and you'd even have a secondary weapon to fall back on because the flamethrower is such a bad primary you're constantly falling back on your shotgun to get anything done. I don't see many heavies or soldiers ignoring their fully loaded primaries in favor of their shotgun, do you? Hell you could've been an engineer here and had a mini shooting people at the same time, at the cost of 25 less health; you'd have eaten that rocket, sure, but maybe it wouldn't have mattered because of the extra damage from the mini, and the fact that, just like scout, you could swap to your pistol once your shotgun clip was empty.  RS might be better than the shotgun on Pyro but that doesn't make it an overpowered weapon, otherwise it would be used on Soldier as well."
truetf2,3dlczx,BetaDjinn,3,Sat Jul 18 07:52:15 2015 UTC,"If I were a scout, I'd also not have been able to stuff the soldier, or prevent the demo from getting on point.  I'd also not be able to send every player on to predictable arks making the shots piss-easy to hit.  The flamethrower is also a really good way of dealing damage in the right scenario, that just wasn't it.  An engineer would not have been able to build a mini in time. Even pre-mettle it likely would have likely ended to the 2nd soldier, or the demo.   RS might be better than the shotgun on Pyro but that doesn't make it an overpowered weapon, otherwise it would be used on Soldier as well   This is the worst argument I've heard. Beggar's bazooka wouldn't be OP on the heavy either, does that mean it's not overpowered? Besides, it is overpowered on soldier. Guaranteed if it were unbanned you'd see a lot of pocket soldiers running RS.  The RS essentially rewards you a TON of free damage for doing what you do anyway. The downside is negated by the fact that your extra damage kills them in fewer shots."

Maybe another minor downside and it would be balanced. I also feel they should split it like the equalizer so there's a soldier and pyro counterpart for the weapon with minor differences ( pyro one doesn't come with switch speed bonus etc)."
truetf2,3dlczx,pikimaung,9,Sat Jul 18 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"Pyro is going to be with the combo and is largely responsible for helping to defend the combo. Pick class threats include Spy, Sniper Scout and Soldier. Pyro is already an active deterrent for Spy. Versus Scout and Soldier, Pyro is a bit more limited. Capable to a small degree, but limited. With the Reserve Shooter alone? Pyro can actively help to deny both Scout and Soldier far more efficiently. A Scout basically cannot jump and therefore would get torn to shreds when in range of the Pyro + any other teammate, whereas a Soldier is undeniably not going to survive a jump attempt, nor will he have a very large window with which to try to complete the med pick; minigun fire + one good reserve shooter shot is GG. On some maps, merely manuevering around might prove difficult if the pyro is watching him.  Basically, this is a pretty drastic implication for one singular weapon. That one weapon does a lot to hinder two classes from performing one of their major tasks by quite a reasonable degree, which also frees up some more aggression time for a Heavy, who would normally be largely responsible for covering for Scout and Soldier pick attempts.   Personally I don't think that any weapon that's banned would do a whole lot to rock the boat and change the meta by a huge margin. Regardless, try and put yourself in the shoes of a soldier or a scout. It basically makes med picks a death sentence altogether. As things stand now, a Soldier has decent odds of a med pick if he jumps while the main counters (Heavy) are ill-prepared or absent. Pyro with Reserve Shooter doubles the number of threats and severely cuts into just how much time he has to try and make that jump. And Scout...? Scout's life depends on his speed and on dodging. If he can't jump without taking a big hit, he's dead. You would see far less Scout support for the demo, let alone any attempts to get a med pick.   The overall point is that while Pyros might cheer, it would feel as though Pyros are 20% happier while Scouts and Soldiers are 60% more discontent with their capabilities in Highlander and the fun they're having. Those are just numbers pulled out of thin air of course, but the point is that in the grand scheme of things and providing a fun experience for everyone, it's very difficult to make a case for the damned thing.  In that same light, consider the Air Strike, which was recently banned. Why? Because the thing fires too damned fast; it's not OP by any means, but where it does excel is it's very much capable of getting a med pick incredibly fast thanks to it's firing speed. With a normal soldier jump, the team has a reasonable window of time to react and deny him. With the Air Strike, the window is pathetic and small, so med ends up dead with very little that he could've done, while even Heavy and other defenders are frustrated with just how small the window is. Would Soldier appreciate the weapon? Yes. Would the happiness of soldier outweigh the frustration of Medic, Heavy and others? Hell no. There is a point where the league will deem a weapon as simply being unfun to play against."

Minicrits don't have falloff, and it minicrits anybody who is airborne. Straight upgrade to stock for pyro. In a fight, the lack of staying power from the reduced clip size is eclipsed by the fact that the pyro has a powerful primary with movement impairing abilities. Flares can miss, be dodged by airstrafing, and be poorly timed. The chances of this happening with a hitscan shotgun are much lower. Add to that the trapping powers of the airblast and moving within lag-compensation range of a pyro becomes a guaranteed loss of 100 hp with no expenditure of effort or risk on the part of the pyro. At least if you walk into a sniper sightline the sniper has to actually hit the shot."
truetf2,3dlczx,Bobbicals,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"The funniest thing about it getting banned is the fact that all it took was +1 to the mag for people to stop ignoring the weapon.  3 shots sucked, yeah, but the functionality of the weapon hasn't changed since the Pyro got it. I'm just some Gold-scrub that played way-back-when and ran it full time for a season. I don't remember too many other Pyros that did that or even ever wanted to even equip it. Either way, around Season 11/12 of UGC HL the Reserve Shooter got +1 to the mag so now it was just a tad more effective at what it originally even did. And then that was all it took for people to stop ignoring it. And then it got really popular because it did as much damage as the Flare Combo, if not more if you were close enough. And then it got banned.  I can't honestly say pyro combo-ing takes too much skill; shotgun/flare comboing is fairly easy. Shotgun combos still hurt like a bitch. Flare combos still hurt like a bitch. I think people just don't want to hear the Krit sound played in their head when they're jumping around."
truetf2,3dlczx,sefsefeffsefse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:52:49 2015 UTC,I knew more than a few pyros that used it borderline exclusively season 10 onwards
truetf2,3dlczx,runny6play,2,Sun Jul 19 07:28:46 2015 UTC,It's basically the same as random crits. You shoot someone and if they happen to be jumping then it does extra damage. I think if Valve made it so that if it only mini-critted after you airblast them then it would be more viable.
truetf2,3dlczx,Archetype694,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:49 2015 UTC,because its a garbage weapon that sholdnt be giving out crits for a regular jump. its ONLY meant for boosted jumps hence why it was giving to soldier originally. pyro shouldnt even have it
truetf2,3dlczx,TR0LL4X,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"pyros new airblast mechanic is kind of a stun-lock. There is no avoiding that shot. The Same could be said about the flare. But the flare isn't hitscan,4 shots and extra switch speed. it also effects all airborne players."

truetf2,3dlczx,-ThG-13thDoctor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:40:46 2015 UTC,Because pyro is already a gimmicky class. RS is a crutch for dumb pyros that don't know how to hit flares or consistently hit meatshots with the regular shotgun. It's broken because it gives idiots the power to deal with those who don't play like idiots.
truetf2,3dlczx,Archetype694,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"Nobody likes dying to a Pyro. They're so used to the class doing nothing but reflect spam and spycheck that it makes them angry when they actually die to one.  RS is as poorly designed as most weapons which only have a reduced clip size for a downside, though. This is especially egregious for secondary weapons, since their very nature means you'll be taking as few shots as possible with them (well, unless you're the Pyro, in which case your primary weapon is again only used for reflects and spy checks because of its many, many flaws).  Ironically it's still very inferior to the flaregun."

truetf2,3ddntj,hexxytv,7,Wed Jul 15 16:03:00 2015 UTC,Can someone explain the detonator bit at the end? It curved towards the heavy? Is there a type of autoaim?
truetf2,3ddntj,disciplinedragon,17,Wed Jul 15 14:01:36 2015 UTC,It's because the pyro is standing in front of an object (Soldier) within 176hu. When the soldier is gone the aim returns to when there's no object in front of him within 176hu. I guess you can call it an autoaim for close range targets now that I think about it.
truetf2,3ddntj,metawe,11,Wed Jul 15 14:08:23 2015 UTC,"I don't see how it's really aim assist/ auto aim. It's not like the projectile knows what's behind the object at the time of firing and swerves towards it. It might vary per projectile but both flares and rockets in this video seemed to go more towards the left every time regardless of if a player was behind the soldier/prop.  In most cases the object 176hu or closer will stay there so this would affect very few cases. I believe it is common knowledge that rockets (and some other projectiles) come from the bottom right which affects close range fights. However, it is not intuitive if you're new to the game so I don't see how it's autoaim at all considering it's harder to aim at something without using your crosshair, and instead, a vague idea of shooting slightly to the top-left to compensate.  Not to undermine this video, it is helpful and interesting information and I'm just talking about how it's not autoaim."
truetf2,3ddntj,Bronan_the_Brobarian,8,Wed Jul 15 14:32:04 2015 UTC,"I just thought that it's autoaim cause it automatically adjusts the direction (That's not quite the correct word. Umm, degree?) of where the rocket will shoot depending on where the target is.  Angle, that's the word"
truetf2,3ddntj,pre4edgc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"If you use left handed models the projectile will come from the left side. This makes it easier or harder to spam certain points and also changes rocket jump dynamics. It used to be that you could bind a key to switch handedness in a game, but that was removed."
truetf2,3ddntj,Basmannen,12,Thu Jul 16 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/pt9ZugC.png  In this totally-created-in-paint image, the red circle represents the Pyro, the dark blue represents the Soldier, and the light blue represents the Heavy. The black line is the sight line, or where your crosshair is. Initially, it's aiming at the Soldier. The gray lines are the important parts, because the projectile is going to make a beeline towards where your crosshair is on. Because it started on the Soldier, and you fire from the right side (or left depending on viewmodels), it's going to take the dark gray path, even after the Soldier disappears, rather than the light gray path (which is for when you are actually aiming at the wall and not the Soldier). Even though it doesn't seem like it, it's heading left because of the original path it was taking, and it'll hit the Heavy despite the Heavy being nowhere in the sightlines."

truetf2,3ddntj,chaorace,2,Wed Jul 15 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"It actually goes in a straight line from the Detonator to the Heavy. Basically the path it's going to take is calculated to go from the Detonator to the Soldier, but if you remove the Soldier (after the projectile is fired) then the projectile will keep going along that same line.  Take a look a bit earlier and you'll see the same thing with the Soldier jumping over the rockets: the rockets aren't landing where the crosshair is pointed."
truetf2,3ddntj,spencer32320,7,Wed Jul 15 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"This happens because the projectile paths are designed to match the viewmodel position on the weapon. That's why the paths start slightly to the right of the cursor (projectile path starts from the launcher instead of the center of the camera). This is also why the starting position is flipped if you use flipped viewmodels  For these reasons, The Original is the only rocket launcher exempt from this rule, because it's viewmodel is positioned at the center of the camera"

truetf2,3ddbyy,Derpmind,18,Wed Jul 15 11:21:43 2015 UTC,"The spawns felt very counter intuitive. To defend our second after losing mid, spawns are far right. Severe height disadvantage as we're destroyed by people on catwalk as well as the farthest possible spot from playing the objective to our far left and being relevant to the objective.   There were lots of props that felt like they were put in as a mapmaking aesthetic and not so much to the playability. Same with parts of the map that felt like ""fluff"". Even if I wasn't standing in a choke point, it felt cramped. At mid, the underneath part added a dimension to midfights that didn't feel dynamic.  I wish the chokes were wider. It's so easy to lock people out and juggle them with damage on too many parts of the map. An m2 pyro can destroy pushes more so than normal.   Sniper sightlines at mid are crazy strong. Same with the sightlines at second. Whoever's sniper dies at mid lost the mid.  The map as a whole seemed to really favor being passive and tanking the sniper hard and waiting for picks. Not the most fun for the 8 other classes on our team. Just my two cents while I played on it.   Edit: after thinking a bit more, last felt like it had insurmountable problems for the defenders. It was really awkward to defend. If our medic held on the left, which seemed like the place where every combo was holding, the sniper got to take a lot of shots on him from the right side of that partition in the lobby. To be out of that sightline meant our medic had to hold close left which is terribly bad when you have uber disadvantage. Also a sniper can look into spawn when the shutter opens and see resup cabinets. This feels like a flaw when a long range class can see clearly into both left and right spawns as well as the entire floor/point but maybe that was the intention."
truetf2,3ddbyy,flick-,3,Wed Jul 15 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"To defend our second after losing mid, spawns are far right   I'm trying to think of a better place to spawn-- maybe under 2nd?"
truetf2,3ddbyy,ilikebuildingsheds,4,Wed Jul 15 15:42:48 2015 UTC,Yeah! Under second was what I was thinking. It's at least somewhere reasonably close to the objective.
truetf2,3ddbyy,flick-,3,Wed Jul 15 15:49:41 2015 UTC,The map as a whole seemed to really favor being passive and tanking the sniper hard and waiting for picks. Not the most fun for the 8 other classes on our team. Just my two cents while I played on it.
truetf2,3ddbyy,Ausssss,5,Wed Jul 15 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"If you don't have mid you are spawning back at the start, though.  Unless I'm misunderstanding.  The side spawn is for those who have control of mid."
truetf2,3ddbyy,UEAKCrash,2,Wed Jul 15 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"You're correct and not misunderstanding.   I'm assuming that you cap mid (which often happened, at least for our team). I would just edge point with pain train as demo and cap, only for it to seem like a hindrance.  Honestly, the problems with the map might be centric to my team and others could've really enjoyed the flow.

Not to mention I've been heavily focusing on this map almost exclusively for a year and a half straight and now everyone just wants me to work on it more.  Burnt out and everyone wants more work done.  But I appreciate the constructive feedback.  I don't play highlander so I have to rely on players finding issues.  Most of my testing, up until match time, had been extremely positive about the map.  This makes me think a lot of people just aren't used to it yet.

truetf2,3ddbyy,metawe,11,Thu Jul 16 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"This map has several flaws. It's impossible to hold 2nd due to there not being any good place to stand and be safe from a sniper sightline on the left. If the offensive team takes control of garden they can easily overwhelm your right side because of the stairs and get their flank class + sniper to slowly push your team into a corner / back in lobby. If you try to hold garden the team on mid can just send people to flank you through tunnel and the whole garden / catwalk area is extremely cramped and a demo being allowed to peek for free for 1 second can destroy your whole team.   Pushing into last seems to be all about slowly getting picks through underneath, top left or a random snipe from the left/bottom side (all from the offensive perspective). Even with picks, the point is so far away that by the time you manage to kill people and walk to point the ones who died earlier (which allowed you to push) have respawned and can clean everyone up since they will all have low health and nothing loaded. The most common way we've capped last is backcapping. The lower area and the multiple ways out of last make it very very easy for a spy to get onto point and backcap.   Most people complain about Mid. The sniper sightlines are extremely long and in most scrims I played, the better strategy seems to be to just sit on their own side for 30+ seconds doing nothing due to there being massive sniper sightlines and no clear point of contact. In most 5cps the clear point of contact for midfights are definitely the midpoint, and it's pretty obvious on a map like gullywash especially, but trying to fight on the midpoint for this map is just a death trap. So you can either try engaging the other team through the little ledges on the outside of the house or under point; both which aren't good fighting areas for 9v9 so most teams just wait for the other team to make a mistake. It's pretty much up to your sniper/spy, a flank class getting behind or ""random"" good damage on an important class due to them making a mistake, to initiate any kind of peeking, not even necessarily a push. In most maps you can just be aggressive, have your soldier bomb as your whole team goes forward but you can't here. I understand that some people don't like how the same strategy works on every map and they should try other things (old meta doesn't work adapt etc) but it's just the concept of being allowed to be aggressive and walk forward I think it should be at least viable.  Overall on the map design, I feel like the whole map suffers from what the new versions of Croissant did but to a lesser degree: flanks having flanks but it's mitigated by the whole map being very close quarters and punishing for any class that isn't soldier; in my opinion, it's not good map design."
truetf2,3ddbyy,ilikebuildingsheds,3,Wed Jul 15 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"flanks having flanks but it's mitigated by the whole map being very close quarters and punishing for any class that isn't soldier   Yeah I found a lot of areas as scout were totally inaccessible if the enemy soldier was also there (the pathways between 2nd and mid, water under last). I think this could be helped with better prop placement-- there are lots of props on the map but a lot of them aren't useful for dodging spam?"
truetf2,3ddbyy,Amelsander,7,Wed Jul 15 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really like it, it has to much nooks and cranny's to hide in.

truetf2,3ddbyy,Dovahk1in,6,Wed Jul 15 11:55:09 2015 UTC,"I dislike the sniper sightlines on second. A sniper on the bridge to point can quickly scope in to anybody coming from garden, main choke, or around the flank, covering every possible avenue of attack.  Also, that whole basement area when pushing last has one easily-defended exit."
truetf2,3ddbyy,kierkkadon,6,Wed Jul 15 11:59:57 2015 UTC,"My team had a blast playing it. We went over it very carefully before scrims, scrimmed it against a bunch of good teams with a variety of outcomes, and overall had a great time. One of my favorite maps.  I have one nitpick: the forward spawn when you own mid is too far on the flank. This is where you'll spawn if you fail a push to 2nd and have to reset as the enemy takes mid - but you have to walk backwards to get into position and not overextend.  Also, if you don't break the glass panels in the ceiling when you cap last you didn't actually win."
truetf2,3ddbyy,fatmoonkins,5,Wed Jul 15 13:42:00 2015 UTC,It was a fun map for pyro since it felt very cramped and it was basically a waste of uber if you didn't kill their pyro before trying to uber through chokes. (I'm not biased or anything..)  I agree with Metawe who said 2nd is hard to hold. There's nowhere to really defend from that isn't in a sniper sightline or easily accessible from their flank classes. I know our medic had to retreat to lobby a few times while we were on point or bridge or else she was in a sniper sightline or very easily bombed by a soldier.  Last seemed rather weak for engineer since there wasn't a great place for your sentry but personally don't think it's an issue. It prevented a huge stalemate on last as long as your team had any amount of coordination pushing into last.
truetf2,3ddbyy,0Valkyrie0,2,Wed Jul 15 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"Not quite a fan spy wise, however props to the map maker for putting in all the time and effort. /u/flick- makes some good, in depth points about it, I would read his"
truetf2,3ddbyy,ilikebuildingsheds,2,Wed Jul 15 14:33:20 2015 UTC,I think the experience of glassworks will improve as it develops more of a meta.   Edit with changes I'd like to see:    large health pack in the flank area with the truck  a more optimal sentry spot for holding last  the sniper sightlines more occluded on mid/2nd (shouldn't be able to shut everyone down from the point)/last  the boxes inside the shutter door in lobby added back in for spy (were present in rc5)  slightly wider hallways between 2nd and mid  a prop added on the other side of the flank area with the truck  make the water area under last a little taller
truetf2,3ddbyy,UEAKCrash,2,Wed Jul 15 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"I removed that box climbing route and replaced it with the ramp next to the platform because the boxes created a really nasty sniper sightline all the way to their front door, while only your head would be showing."

Heavy is a different thing though. Rarely does a map come to my mind where I feel more useless on mid than on glassworks. Same goes for medic from my observations. Terrible mid for both.  Additionally I dislike sniper sightlines on mid and 2nd a lot.  Besides that, it's a decent map for highlander 5cp. But it's highlander 5cp...so....meh"

truetf2,3ddbyy,Iustinus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:18 2015 UTC,"I ran Scorch Shot & played pyro-sniper most of the map. Here's what seemed to work for us.   Keeping sniper & friends in spawn from the lobby area at last. Our soldier could then spam the other upper part of last where their combo was or take out their gun. I went to the window at mid and spammed their side of mid. Lots of small damage on lots of players. Made their demo stop spamming point to kill me or they had to commit sniper/flank to me. Spammed their sniper from choke so our team could push 2nd. I'd light the sniper on fire and when he came back out our sniper would already have a charged Shot lined up. That sightlines was too good to play fairly. Holding behind rock on 2nd seemed better than near point then spamming garden with our demo. I peeked around rock to stall ubers. Pushing choke if their team is in garden and wrap around them, especially if their flanks are down. We brought soldier and heavy to watch garden while medic, demo & pyro went choke then both groups collapsed on garden - easy way to get a drop or force. Running jag and getting forward lvl3 up at mid while pushing second stops this though."
truetf2,3ddbyy,Sabesaroo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:06:33 2015 UTC,"Second points are very hard to capture, either from last or from mid."
truetf2,3ddbyy,Phenominated,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:21:55 2015 UTC,As medic I found the map alright outside of midfights. The sniper lines are crazy on mid so I usually ended up rushing to the point so I could get heals onto our flank and combo fighting the point. I was only able to do it because the opposition solly didn't focus his time on me allowing me just to sit there and pump heals out. Everything else is pretty good but the garden area is really tight but the only really viable push. Lower flank into 2nd puts you on an awful low ground and the tunnel is sniper/spam danger forcing a very early uber. I really like last. Lots of options to push and good positions to hold when defending especially with the short respawns as defence.
truetf2,3db6kt,BoopMcGoop,23,Tue Jul 14 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"Sydney Sleeper can make anyone take mini-crits on quickscope, and can have stupidly long jarates at full charge on, say, a heavy,   Quickscope jarate disappears very quickly. It shouldn't stop any push. Eight seconds of jarate is much more substantial, but remember that they're giving up the ability to do more than 150 damage for that. The loss of headshots is significant. You're losing the ability to quickscope enemy snipers and to one short heavies. I still don't really see good snipers using it. I think it should be allowed for now at least. If it actually becomes a problem then it can be banned."
truetf2,3db6kt,Kered13,4,Wed Jul 15 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it's working currently but the last time I used it since the big update it seemed to be a bit broken. There was no delay at all after scoping (unlike with the 200ms delay for headshots on the stock rifle) for the Jarate to work so you could +attack and +attack2 on the same button and use it like some sort of mini-crit railgun. I'd have no problem at all with it being allowed if this was changed to work similarly to the stock rifle's delay, but as it is it's just too versatile a weapon for bad snipers with a bind to be ignored"
truetf2,3db6kt,Siouxsie2011,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:32:38 2015 UTC,I think 8 sec jarate on hs would be interesting.

truetf2,3db6kt,memccann-,15,Wed Jul 15 12:07:29 2015 UTC,"Air Strike has no real downsides when in use considering the bonus fire-rate makes your damage output great,   Yep should be banned   Sydney Sleeper can make anyone take mini-crits on quickscope, and can have stupidly long jarates at full charge on, say, a heavy,   Yep   and the Dalokohs bar is basically a near upgrade (medium healthkit bug)     They fixed that already   The BFB has always been an OP weapon, not airjumping is a pretty minute payoff for insane speed, but now every weapon's a Natascha to it. Would you say it's balanced now? (I'm indifferent)     No because 1 good shot gets your right back to speed, and a average shot gets you half way there, which is still super fast.    The Booties take away some of your damage, and a lot of your ability to counter scouts, but now it means you can get to mid and set up traps and just generally have a better position before they do - I think this is pretty balanced in practise, but I've only tried on granary so far.     It's a interesting weapon but most demos would probably stick with pills b/c 10% isn't too much extra speed.    The scorch shot can now destroy any class pushing in  and deals more damage + minicrits now, basically making the detonator weep in the corner - I'd say it's slightly OP at distances but I've not seen much of it so far     Super annoying but detonator keeps its niche of jumping.    The pomson should never have gotten uber draining, but now that the losses can be regained in seconds, is it worth banning when all the other primaries are more viable?     no because it's not fun to lose uber, even a little bit   The Jag is not necessarily OP, but definitely is a direct upgrade to stock when paired with the rescue ranger and the wrangler, although the wrangler nerfs mean it's less effective anway - is it worth banning the jag or does it merely raise engie back to square one?     Not sure. Maybe.    The Short Circuit isn't spammable now, and as always is countered by Heavy in so many spots.     Still a big screw you to explosive classes and isn't fun to play against   The Vaccinator isn't banned in many places, but it's definitely worse now that passive crit resist is gone     it's useless. No point banning it because no half decent team would use it.    The Bargain is buffed, but the bug remains - either way it should probably be banned considering 3 heads = faster than stock charging     it's a direct upgrade   The spy changes I'd say are all fine, but just why is the RTR still banned?     Because it takes very little time to downgrade a building and isn't fun to play against."

truetf2,3db6kt,Kered13,2,Wed Jul 15 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"The day before Gun Mettle, I would have sworn that the Bargain would completely invalidate stock. After using it in pubs, I think stock will remain strong. The -50% charge rate is huge, it takes nearly seven seconds for a full-charged shot. You need headshot kills to boost the charge rate, but a good amount of a Sniper's kills are bodyshots and not all headshots are guarenteed kills, unless they're fully charged, which the Bargain really can't do.  The reason why the Machina has such a huge presence in Highlander is because of the reward for fully charging your shot. The damage output is impressive, as is stock. The Bargain simply cannot keep up with other rifles' damage output that way, even if you are able to get above two heads, because of how long it takes you to charge those first shots.  And even if you get those heads, Sniper is still a squishy class. Going on a rampant 10+ kill steak is possible, but dying to a Sniper, a Spy, or any flank class before you break into serious headshot streaks is way more common.  If it's unbanned, I'd doubt you'd see many players using it, except for Sniper carries in lower divisions."

truetf2,3db6kt,Triforceman555,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:13:59 2015 UTC,"The spy changes I'd say are all fine, but just why is the RTR still banned?   Because it takes very little time to downgrade a building and isn't fun to play against.    Is that a good enough reason?"
truetf2,3db6kt,Big_Green_Piccolo,2,Wed Jul 15 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"The building performs the remainder of the upgrade/build animation after being de-sapped, therefore the RTR can disable a building longer. EDIT: It also immediately empties upgrade progress."
truetf2,3db6kt,Tewgon,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:54 2015 UTC,But it takes longer to destroy the building. Looks like a side grade.
truetf2,3db6kt,Big_Green_Piccolo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"While it can take more than twice the duration for the RTR to destroy a level 3, either sapper should destroy it without assistance if the Engineer is dead on defense. On offense, the Engineer might be able to save a building at level 1 if he has a quick route from spawn. If the Pyro has the Homewrecker, the bit of damage the stock Sapper deals seldom matters if the enemy team attacks and he doesn't deflect spam - she can't repair his buildings.  IIRC it has little to no effect on dispensers/teleporters apart from downgrades since those buildings are active during upgrade animations.  If the Engineer is alive, the animation gives the enemy more time before the Sentry can fire and/or be shielded. The stock Sapper deals enough damage before removal that well-timed rockets/grenades can 2-shot the sentry before the next swing, but focus fire is already very effective. Extra time is more valuable than a bit of damage/metal cost when the Engineer's team is backing him.  To summarize, the Red-Tape Recorder has net benefits even when it fails to downgrade a building."
truetf2,3db6kt,Tewgon,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"The slow downgrade time has a tremendous effect on teleporters - the engineer can reach the entrance after his respawn and save it. You also can't easily telefrag engineers with RTR like you can with the stock sapper.  Of course it has benefits, benefits different from the stock sapper. It is a weapon and weapons do things. Why ban it?"

You also can't easily telefrag engineers with RTR like you can with the stock sapper.   I meant to say that unlike sentries, the RTR doesn't disable other buildings for a longer duration than stock. If it's harder to telefrag with, then that is probably not the case for teleporters.  It takes roughly 7s to downgrade a building to level 1; even without a teleporter it's possible to save a building from destruction but it downgrades faster than stock can destroy a building. The RTR's downside saves the Engineer some construction time (compared to a destruction) but it's not necessarily safe to continue building where it was sapped.   Of course it has benefits, benefits different from the stock sapper. It is a weapon and weapons do things. Why ban it?   The RTR is both annoying and better than stock in most situations. For coordinated saps, it buys time. For solo-sap harassment if the Engineer can  reach his buildings within 7-8s a single downgrade is likely to cost more metal than the repair cost for stock's damage (EDIT: In addition to taking much more time to recover from)."
truetf2,3db6kt,Tewgon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, i honestly don't think ""it isn't fun"" is good enough to ban a weapon for. This isn't a fun contest, it's a balance contest. One is an opinion, and the other can break the game."
truetf2,3db6kt,Anthony356,4,Thu Jul 16 06:18:19 2015 UTC,"I have ran Scorch Shot the past 2 weeks in pubs, lobbies, scrimmages & matches. Here's what I found:  I only get away with running Scorch Shot because I play in Steel with a more than decent Heavy & Demo plus enemy spies that usually die to m1 & m2 while they try fancy trickstabs.  My midrange damage is crap compared to Shotgun.  At close range my damage is even more crap compared to Flare or Shotgun.  At long range pushing back ubers, annoying Snipers, or with random spy-checking the Scorch Shot excels.  Edit: Overall it is a more than decent sidegrade. I would compare it to the pre Gun Mettle Black Box for roamer in 6s."
truetf2,3db6kt,Iustinus,10,Wed Jul 15 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"Baby Face's Blaster   Speed changing weapons are generally bad, and you are still crazy fast even after getting hit.   Ali Baba's Wee Booties   Probably should be banned in 6s; they are ridiculous for rollouts (1-2 extra seconds plus 25 or more health). They seem manageable in HL.   Scorch Shot   Not that strong and replaces Pyro's valuable secondary.   Pomson 6000   Uber draining is an awful mechanic; keep it banned.   Jag   I wouldn't be surprised to see it removed from 6s; not sure for HL.   Short Circuit   Just a terrible idea for an item; keep that garbage banned.   Vaccinator   Such a useless item that there's no real reason to ban it.   Bazaar Bargain   Still bugged and mostly better than stock.   Red Tape Recorder   Can take a sentry from 3 to 2 almost instantly.   Liberty Launcher   Still probably just a crutch, but we'll have to see for 6s since Scout is so much more prominent."
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,7,Wed Jul 15 00:53:31 2015 UTC,"Speed changing weapons are generally bad, and you are still crazy fast even after getting hit.   So the Escape Plan and Power Jack are bad?"
truetf2,3db6kt,Kered13,7,Wed Jul 15 03:12:16 2015 UTC,Some 6s formats do ban the Powerjack and I honestly think if the Escape Plan came out today it would be an instant ban.  Edit: Also the fact that they're melee weapons with increased damage taken means that you don't actually confront sped up Soldiers/Pyros.
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,13,Wed Jul 15 04:17:32 2015 UTC,I doubt escape would be banned  You have to be massively weak to get the speed gain to be useful and plus minicrits when you whip it out = relatively balanced
truetf2,3db6kt,BLEEARGH,5,Wed Jul 15 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah but how good it is for rollouts can't be ignored. It would be seen as a mandatory item for all Soldiers, which means it would probably get banned. We're just so used to it at this point and the net gameplay effect is positive, so we have no real reason to ban it."
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,10,Wed Jul 15 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"You miss my point  We don't just ban anything that all people use (or we'd ban ubersaw etc)  It's balanced because it isn't something that massively upsets the game - sure, it's borderline imperative to getting your team to mid quickly and with health, but it's not unmitigatable bullshit.   Also not all soldiers use it, great many use pain train or even the gardener when that wasn't banned  Speaking of! Banned MG, why??? Oh because people don't have to be good to get a free pick - bullshit"
truetf2,3db6kt,BLEEARGH,4,Wed Jul 15 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"The Escape Plan and the Ubersaw aren't comparable in the slightest. The Ubersaw is more of a ""why not?"" weapon whereas a Pocket basically has to run the Escape Plan or his team will be hamstrung at mid. I agree that it is overall good for the game and definitely not unmitigatable bullshit, but I think the fact that it really is mandatory to run means that it would be considered for a ban if it came out today.  Also my original point was that it's not comparable to BFB (which is still ban worthy) since you aren't actually fighting a sped up Soldier; it just helps his map mobility."
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,3,Wed Jul 15 14:35:40 2015 UTC,Yeah but how good it is for rollouts can't be ignored   You still have to damage yourself to gain the benefits and in order to get to fighting without instantly dying you rely on your Medic.
truetf2,3db6kt,Ultra-Bad-Poker-Face,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:01:48 2015 UTC,doesn't that apply to wee booties though? demos can just run them once to mid then switch to GL after first death?
truetf2,3db6kt,mayotan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:46:26 2015 UTC,Probably should be banned in 6s; they are ridiculous for rollouts (1-2 extra seconds plus 25 or more health). They seem manageable in HL.   From my first comment
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"isn't the nett effect positive with wee booties, just like the escape plan?"
truetf2,3db6kt,mayotan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:40:12 2015 UTC,No because Demoman is basically forced to forgo one of his guns for mid fights. Any plays with pipes are suddenly out of the equation.

truetf2,3db6kt,Andreas_hb,3,Thu Jul 16 02:41:42 2015 UTC,How is the short circuit a terrible idea? Have you actually played against it since the update?
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,2,Wed Jul 15 13:59:08 2015 UTC,Being able to completely deny one and a half classes without even aiming is kind of a bad mechanic.
truetf2,3db6kt,BetaDjinn,7,Wed Jul 15 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Again, have you actually played against it yet? Even then, it doesn't counter heavies and people seem to forget you can't have the wrangler with it as well"
truetf2,3db6kt,bimbo74,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yes I have played against it, and it has nothing to do with sentries, but everything to do with pushing with your through choke points while totally rejecting all explosive spam.  I'm not a HL player though so if you all want it really bad then go for it."
truetf2,3db6kt,Spengy,2,Wed Jul 15 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"This version of the SC is quite exploitable, you definitely can't push through a choke and reject all spam, it has some blind spots and the firing interval means you can get baited easily"

truetf2,3dcdsm,BanditSC2,6,Wed Jul 15 04:15:42 2015 UTC,It's actually an explosion radius nerf -- midair stickies have decreased radius which ramps up over two seconds and stickies that have touched a surface will have full explosion radius. As long as you can aim your stickies you should be fine.
truetf2,3dcdsm,SUSAltd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:57:24 2015 UTC,What's the max explosion radius debuff at the time of firing?  -50% down to -0% at 2s (assuming no 'world' contact)?  I honestly can't remember
truetf2,3dcdsm,BluntTruthGentleman,3,Thu Jul 16 06:35:08 2015 UTC,"Even if damage it's wasn't nerfed, damage done is down across the board for demos so be prepared to occasionally be outdamaged by a scout, and by the pocket the majority of the time, no matter how well you think you can aim stickies.   As for adjusting to this change, it's still roughly the same playstyle as pre-nerf, but you may have to play more passively as you can't really control a game like you could before. Expect stuff like being left out of ubers in favour of bringing scouts in a lot more often."

truetf2,3da8wy,MovkeyB,8,Wed Jul 15 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"Tell him bye bye and that you left his couch on the curb.   A team of 6 players of skill level 6 that works well together and is all friends is going to perform better than a team of skill level 8 where there is infighting. (The skill levels mean nothing, just wanted something quantifiable)   This guy is not good. Attitude and teamwork is important. While at this level, he certainly will help you win, because low level tf2 is mostly about skill and less about strategy, I don't think it's worth it. He is going to drag your team apart.   While I wouldn't worry about his attitude in pubs and lobbies and forums too much (people don't like me on the forums but my old team loved me just fine, voice vs text is totally different) if you have to ask the answer is probably kick.   In addition, low level snipers are a dime a dozen. The reason they stay low level is that higher level teams don't want someone toxic, so they keep him off. Take someone of mediocre skill but good attitude and he will probably improve with the rest of the team."

truetf2,3dazfn,CapriPhonix,10,Wed Jul 15 04:25:04 2015 UTC,When shooting flames a lot of your screen is covered. I'm a casual player but even I notice how little I can see when trying to light somebody on fire while managing incoming rockets.
truetf2,3dazfn,unit220,-4,Wed Jul 15 05:32:14 2015 UTC,"Well, if it covers the screen so much, then try viewmodel_fov 90 or higher. Then, the flames should be just a fraction of the screen."
truetf2,3dazfn,BadLaffs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:54:49 2015 UTC,"viewmodel_fov 0 also does this, for those who are curious."
truetf2,3dazfn,arcfox72,5,Fri Jul 17 02:17:45 2015 UTC,Practice practice practice. Try playing soldier too and get a handle of when to shoot rockets to avoid reflects and apply it to your pyro play. Close range  is where there is really not enough time for reactions usually so prediction is the key.
truetf2,3dazfn,neobowman,4,Tue Jul 14 21:53:26 2015 UTC,"Learn your minimum effective distance!  This is a huge problem with Pyro players. People will consistently overestimate just how close they can get and still reliably reflect on reflex alone.  Go to tr_walkway, spawn a single non-walking soldier, turn on bot resupply, and configure the bot to fire at purely random intervals. Make sure to simulate lag with net_fakelag 40 in console(this is equivalent to 80 ping). Optionally, you can turn off knockback with addcond 28 in console. Keep getting closer until you find the point where you can reflect with 80% certainty and keep practicing until you can reflect with 99% certainty.  Chances are, you'll be surprised just how far away this point is. Human reaction times just don't allow for reflexive point-blank airblasting. Apply this knowledge in practice, try to dance around inside of this zone so that you always have the upperhand in the fight.  A quick side-tip: Try jumping when you expect to get shot by a rocket, even if you can't airblast. This will help minimize incoming damage and allow you to surf the explosion to a safer distance. This tip applies to all classes, but I think it's under-utilized by Pyros because they put all their focus towards the reflect with no backup plan.  Learn enemy tells!  There will be times when you cannot stay in your 100% airblast zone. So predictive airblasting is still a very necessary skill. The most common tell, by far, is jumping before shooting. I wouldn't recommend relying on this tell alone outside of pubs because competitive soldiers have wised up to this and learned to exploit it into making pyros waste their airblast.  My personal favorite tell is this little frantic snapping motion soldiers tend to make when they aim. Basically, if you see a solider/demo swinging around, even a little bit, there's a pretty good chance an explosive is coming soon after, so try to capitalize!  Even taking tells into account, you only get one shot to escape and the enemy has infinite opportunities. Your chances are bad at this range even if you're good at predictive airblasting, so really, seriously, do not just run in trying to close even more distance. Get back to your safe airblast zone and pick him apart with flames/flares/shotguns  tl;dr Pyro is Marth"
truetf2,3dazfn,chaorace,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:10 2015 UTC,Practice really  The more you play the game the better you'll get at stuff like this until it basically becomes second nature
truetf2,3dazfn,BLEEARGH,2,Tue Jul 14 22:11:30 2015 UTC,"I remember TMP wrote some posts on the subject years ago but I think he's deleted his reddit account so it'll be hard to find. In essence, it came down to mind games where (assuming equal skill), the pyro would be at a disadvantage because you're usually reacting to what a soldier is doing.  The key stuff is to be mindful of timing windows, such as the cooldown between airblast puffs and rocket firing. You've got to practice to get those timings learned mechanically so that you can play with them when it comes to mindgames."
truetf2,3dazfn,telamascope,2,Tue Jul 14 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"This might seem counterintuitive (especially if you're newer) but if you're finding yourself losing a lot of fights in close range combat as pyro, chances are you're too close for too long. The best way to reflect a short range rocket is to make it a long range rocket. If you're close enough to airblast the soldier, put some distance (after puffing if you're using flare gun) between you with an airblast + backpedal.  I agree with the other comment about it being all mind games, especially against better soldiers, and you're always going to be one level behind them in the prediction game, since it's up to the soldier to shoot the rocket in the first place.  I'd also suggest getting a friend to practice against for the sole purpose of having him use all the different launchers so you can learn to recognize them from longer range, and train your internal clock for both the speed and clip size of the enemy soldier on first sight. Often it's better to eat or dodge the last rocket in the clip and finish them off while they're down to the options of reloading or using shotgun/melee."
truetf2,3dazfn,xeroloplan,2,Wed Jul 15 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"Everyone else here has great advice, but I just want to say that you shouldn't get discouraged if you're having a hard time. You are not going to be able to reflect everything (but don't let that stop you from trying!). I'm approaching 400 hours on pyro and I have days where everything connects, and I have days where I eat rockets for 30 minutes until I ragequit and play another class. Just gotta keep going and not let it get to you. :)"
truetf2,3dazfn,Cheshamone,2,Wed Jul 15 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"To add to everyone's good advice, I'll say this: keep doing damage. Don't be that pyro that just sits there shuffling left and right waiting for a rocket. Either get close and burn and flare or if you use shotgun put some shots on the guy. But if you're that close to a soldier or demo he should be at the very least on fire. A soldier that's damaged will get pressured to do something before he inevitably dies so he'll have to shoot. After that you'll get a feel of their reaction times. It's more complicated because different players have different reaction times - there have been times I've been fooled by valve server soldiers because they were so slow to shoot compared to a comp player."

Also, sometimes when you just walk around a corner into a soldier you're going to eat a rocket; try not to panic reflect the air, because that'll just put you off timing for the second reflect and get you killed."

This really depends on your knowledge and experience of the game. You should watch some Pyro frag videos to see when the opponent would fire. Or just get into some pubs and put yourself into that situation. If you try to train in pubs, then don't go for Valve servers. Try mge servers.   B, flee. If you see your opponent reloading, then airblast him away, flare shot him, and run. If he's after you, even better. Since you're running away, you should've put yourself at a better position, a long range combat. Then you start reflecting his rockets. Or if he switches to shotgun, get close to him."

But to answer your question, no you should not protect your med. If you are about to use kritz you need your pyro or heavy with you, if they are both dead get at least your soldier or scout to hand around you and just try to sticky snipe people instead of walking forward."

Obviously you need to prioritize targets, and an aggressive enemy might take priority, but realistically you're better off hitting a cluster with kritz.

truetf2,3d9tv7,diath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:21 2015 UTC,I personally always protect my medic in a comp environment and it is really a top priority most of the time. If we are running kritz I am going to want to time it so that I can wipe out a good portion of the team by surprise with my first few shots. If the kritz goes wrong often you will want to get out of there rather than trying to overextend to get some kills.   I protect the medic by interposing myself between the enemy and my medic while using my weapons. I rely on the heal beam and movement to tank.

truetf2,3d8ao4,Valuigi,18,Tue Jul 14 07:57:13 2015 UTC,"From a spy's perspective, engies are so damn quick! The Jag+building pickup speed increase really allows skilled engies to have much better positioning and follow with their team.  Ironically, buildings go up slower now and sapped wrangled sentries are harder to handle, so I guess engies have to be a bit more reliant on their own damage output with the shotgun/secondary/wrench. Which is great actually, as it ups the skill cap and moves engies away from being entirely building dependant."
truetf2,3d8ao4,aoid,13,Tue Jul 14 09:17:07 2015 UTC,"Played comp for the first time since the changes in the retf2 cup, here is my team's 4th game https://youtu.be/48torxL9uS0  I've always kind of liked the idea of perma-jag but this change has made that the most viable option, for me. Minis just don't cut it anymore. Wrangler is also barely worth equipping so you're better just building sentries in spots it can shoot everything without being wrangled and rescuing it til it goes down (which is fast). Because you can now build a lvl3 again rather quickly.   Overall though engineer got nerfed. Spies and heavies are quite strong against assets now. A spy saps and shoots a lvl3 and it goes down so quickly now.   Also Valve REALLY needs to fix a bug which you can see twice in my POV video above (both shown on defence of 2nd and then 3rd points). When redeploying a sentry, hitting it to speed up the redeployment eats 100+ metal for absolutely no reason. It doesn't give the sentry health or ammo, it just makes your metal disappear. Complete bullshit."
truetf2,3d8ao4,RedSquaree,2,Tue Jul 14 10:26:52 2015 UTC,"You can only speed up the initial deployment animation, but not the levelling animations. This has been in the game ever since the Engineer update. To redeploy a sentry, you only need/can hit it three times (which I like to call the ""3 swings and go"").  Levelling actually nullifies previous restocks and repairs, making it a waste to use metal and Rescue Ranger bolts on the sentry while it isn't fully deployed. Ironically, however, the same is true for spies using the Red Tape recorder, who are just wasting bullets until the building reaches the last stage of its deconstruction."
truetf2,3d8ao4,The_Burger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"Mm, the metal eating bug extends to teleporters too, if you build one while an existing entrance/exit is already built. Very annoying. Rescue Ranger bolts affect redeploying buildings weirdly too.  It's probably something to do with the game trying to differentiate between healing and upgrading states."
truetf2,3d8ao4,bimbo74,0,Tue Jul 14 14:02:06 2015 UTC,"if you build one while an existing entrance/exit is already built. Very annoying.   I believe this is an intended feature. It gives the tele that you're not hitting health, it's actually quite useful because if someone's at the other end it gives you a chance to keep it up while one of your teammates kills them."
truetf2,3d8ao4,RedSquaree,2,Tue Jul 14 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"It happens during setup time, too. It's clearly buggy."
truetf2,3d8ao4,ajfirecracker,12,Tue Jul 14 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"This update took the engineer's best defensive tool, and best offensive tool, and nerfed them both into the ground.   On defense I liked being an important class. The sentry was important, and it took a lot of coordination to take down a good engie nest. Now that the sentry is less important, the engie is less important as well. You could argue that engie shouldn't be that important, and that the wrangler really was too powerful, but either way as an engie main this update made me sad. You could also say that this update raises the engie's skill cap, by making him more shotgun reliant, but you still need to be there to repair your gun when spam or spies try to harass it, so you can't realisticly abandon your buildings and focus entirely on your shotgun. Then, during a push, when the gun goes down, you should be backing up and trying to build another gun (which I'll admit is a lot easier with the new jag) rather than running around with your shotgun. The skill in defensive engieer used to be keeping a gun up and staying alive, now it's waiting for the gun to go down and building it again.  So maybe the offensive engineer got the good end of this update? nope. I think the engineer is now better at setting up a forward base. The jag is better for setting up nests close to the front line, and keeping the team supported. Again though, this is lowering the skill cap for the engineer. When you actually have to commit to a base, you're going to be roaming a whole lot less. Roaming around on the flank is also less effective because you can't throw down a mini to help you in a 1v1 situation. Assuming equal skill, the engineer looses almost every 1v1 now, and can't realistically roam without the help of the scout or soldier by his side. The even bigger problem comes when it's time to actually push. Generally an engie would run in, throw down a mini, and then start doing work with his shotgun. With this update, the mini isn't going to do anything. Trying to put down a sentry with the jag is basically just putting yourself out of the fight, so the only option you have is to ignore buildings, and just play as a shitty scout.   This update made the engineer less powerful, it pushes engineer towards a playstyle that takes less skill, and IMO is less fun to play. I don't doubt this update was good for the game as a whole, but as an engineer, this update kinda sucks."
truetf2,3d8ao4,cornpop16,9,Tue Jul 14 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"Wrangler nerf is a bit too much for me.  If you pull out the wrangler, there is almost no chance of repairing your sentry because repairs do shit healing. To compensate, I like to leave my gun unwrangled and just tank as much damage by using up all my rescue ranger bolts. As they uber into my gun, I keep it up as long as possible and then I RR the gun to a new location. The gun doesn't usually survive, but it makes the enemy waste more time chasing me."
truetf2,3d8ao4,47B-1ME,4,Tue Jul 14 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"I care less about sentries in general and i switch wrenches alot, when i die i almost  always go ee and put an exit near a place where i want to rebuild then tele to spawn, rebuild with jag, switch to sh and tele with a sentry at lvl2 175/200 so it redeploys super fast. Its almost always safe and only counter is to sap exit or camp it so ask someone to check it before you tele back to frontlines.   Also i like to move alot everytime my team gets some ground to deny even more space. Buff to RR and redeploy helps here so much, you can move both sentry and dispenser to a new spot in seconds."
truetf2,3d8ao4,Mostdakka,3,Tue Jul 14 09:25:13 2015 UTC,"I find the most effective way of playing this new engineer is to be far more aggressive than before, and the loadout I use has been massively altered.  I've dropped my minis in favor of level 3s while using the Jag, and use the Rescue Ranger to compensate for the Jag's ineffective repair speed. I've swapped out my Wrangler for Pistol so I can provide direct sustainable damage and self-defense, and where I place my sentries has changed radically.   There's a lot more freedom regarding where you can actually place your gun now, but I think the best place to put them is either as forward as you can to cover as many entrances and exits as possible, or with either the combo or flank so you can assist them with suppressing fire from the sentry."
truetf2,3d8ao4,IncredibleMeh,3,Tue Jul 14 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"Not too bad overall, however:   There used to be a choice between the SH and stock, but equiping the Jag is now a no-brainer Minis are now basically level 0.5s. They don't really promote a different playstyle anymore, which is sad. Valve should have just nerfed them directly instead of reworking them."
truetf2,3d8ao4,Lejeune_Dirichelet,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"The mini sentry deployment nerfs hurt my use of minis more than I expected. When I read the changes I hoped that the addition of repairing them would roughly offset the nerfs in terms of their total power/usefulness, but now I'm doubtful.  In most ways I'm very happy with wrench swapping only destroying the gun. It lets you consider which gun you want to use for just the next life, instead of mostly being locked in for a half round due to the tele and dispensers. This in combination with the mini deployment nerfs and hauling speed buffs have led me to mix stock guns and minis on koth and 5cp.    In most ways I'm very happy with the hauling speed increase. This is something I specifically wanted/suggested, so it makes me especially happy to get it:) I think it's great for making it more viable to haul a dispenser or gun from one hold to the next.  The downside of those two changes is that it makes spawn building and ranking more viable, which is unfortunate because it is boring. If spawn ranking an r3 when an engineer dies becomes common it might be a good idea to adjust the hauling speed to have some sort of decay, maybe with a slightly higher starting speed, with the aim of keeping it at least as good as it is now for adjusting buildings between holds but worse for a long haul from spawn.  I really like the faster swing speed on the Jag. Both faster ranking and faster sapper removal are very nice, and I think the slightly faster but smaller repairs are fine too. IMO if you are using the shotgun the Jag is an easy choice above the SH.  The Wrangler tanking nerf still seems very severe to me, but I haven't played much payload defense or RR engie since the changes."
truetf2,3d8ao4,bacon-stripper,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:54 2015 UTC,"With 100 metal telehauling, increased hauling speed and a Jag on steroids, the update made my old playstyle of RR/Pistol/Wrench much more effective, so I'm definitely not going to complain.  The EE redesign has made a good ""pioneering"" tool to set up a quick teleporter exit before teleporting back to spawn to build up a sentry before heading back to the front. This requires excellent appraisal skills and timing.  The mini nerf didn't affect me too much, perhaps because I prefer to use them more cautiously. The ability to repair them is actually interesting on koth maps."
truetf2,3d8ao4,The_Burger,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"Jag is basically OP, or at least a direct upgrade to stock, rescue rangé is good still, wrangler is worse, short circuit is viable and for the love of god, people, stop whining about it.

truetf2,3d8ao4,BoopMcGoop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"The class has gotten more dynamic around rebuilding and moving bases forward, but at the cost of losing some of it's staying power. I can no longer tank my sentry indefinitely, but I can rebuild faster, or move it from cap to cap.   This is especially true for Dispensers and Teleporters, which can be redeployed much more quickly.    The changes to the Battle Sentry are fairly significant. One has to either pre-build it and redeploy to a final position, or babysit it while it constructs. Definitely makes combat Engineer less dynamic in that regard. I do not like being tethered to my gun when it doesn't have staying power to begin with."

They didn't add variety with this update, really; they just shifted what's worth using as an Engineer. There really doesn't seem to be much difference between offensive and defensive play any more.  Don't me wrong - I think they made some very good changes. But for most of the weapons, they either nerfed or buffed them too hard - as Valve is known to do."

truetf2,3d6dsd,donsweenioli,31,Mon Jul 13 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"Just tacking on a way to make binds more feasible here. I recently made this (as Don here knows, I asked him for help :P).  This specific version allows you to use up to 36 binds while only using the 6 keys on the keypad. Obviously this could be expanded to 81 binds while still only using the keypad (1-9) but remembering that many combinations is probably unfeasible.   Here it is, with a few example binds included:  http://pastebin.com/qunYexia  Obviously, you may want to rearrange these so that ones that are closer in relation are all on the same main key (which I didn't necessarily do in this example as I wanted to put it up as proof of concept).  How this works is you press a keypad key 4-9 and then press another key 4-9. Each combination sends a different bind, for example hitting 4 and then 4 sends ""Scout Down"" while hitting 4 and then 5 sends ""Soldier Down"". Hitting the 3 key resets every input in the event you hit the wrong first number."

It'd take a very understanding team (and an acceptance that you wouldn't be able to go to a high level), but I'm sure it could be worked around. Lots of chat binds (both the deaf guy and the main caller), in-game closed captions, pre-planned strategies, playing a flank class and having good DM skills would all help.  Edit: Also depends somewhat on how good his speech is. If his speech is reasonably good, it'd probably be useful for his main caller to have yes/no chat binds, so he could ask questions like ""should I rotate right?"" etc. If his speech is not quite that good, it might help for him to just work out a reduced vocabulary, perhaps using single words for ""should I go/do <word>?"", like ""push?"" ""right?"" ""last?"", maybe also ""push?"" caller:NO ""soon?"" caller:YES ~15s later~ caller:PUSH."

I'm a plat medic who doesn't have the time to play the game as much as you need to when you're in plat and I'm working on my scout play. We could start a team up and play next season. I figure I could have my numpad bound to communicate what I need to and we could discuss what was needed before hand. Depending on his DM we can do either iron or steel.

There was a guy I knew from streaming who had a serious car accident and lost the use of one arm.   He modified his set up to use his foot (as well as one working hand). He was an amazing player in a load of different fps.   While communication/sound is a big part of the game you can find your way around it just through practice.  I some times will play pubs (I know this is different to comp) with my game muted if there is some thing on the tv or what ever and I still can get frags.  Any way good luck.
truetf2,3d6dsd,crouch_tap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:25:32 2015 UTC,If you put a lot of effort into being aware of the situation. For example hitting tab very often so you know what players are alive and what players are down you can have a pretty good idea of if your team will be pushing or falling back. However in game sound and comms are pretty crucial so it would likely only be an option at an entry level of comp. soldier without sound would likely be easier however heavy would be a decent option as well.
truetf2,3d6dsd,Karl_sagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"Soldier and Heavy? No. He might be able to get away with it as Sniper, albeit at a disadvantage. Unfortunately comms are critical in TF2 and he can only conceivably play non-comm classes, which there really aren't any but Sniper and Scout probably can get away with a lot less.  That's assuming HL though. Not sure 6's is viable at all.`"

There's so much stuff you rely on too function that's sound based in cs without even thinking about comms. I believe a deaf person could get by playing hl soldier though. It may be hard to coordinate and call damage (which are most of soldiers calls) but it's absolutely possible to get by if your team plays around your disability. (This is all in relation to soldier, more difficult on other classes.)"

Maybe if he played roamer    Never heard of pocket hl soldier   the team would have to communicate only through text, which would be a huge issue.   I agree and disagree. I doubt the entire team would have too communicate through text. One or two people. (Ie; one combo class 1 flank class?) would be pre-setup with common chat binds specifically for that player. Ie; we're pushing, class is behind, forward hold, etc. it would be a drawback, definitely, but not as big of an anchor as you might think.

truetf2,3d7wpx,americanbarbarian,17,Tue Jul 14 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"You can't let a scout get close basically. Ideally you want to be playing the scout on your turf. You will have a sightline on him from mid-range and he will be forced to run straight at you with no cover if he wants to approach. Obviously, this doesn't always happen but it's part of the reason why positioning is so important as heavy.  If the scout is jumping over your head, you've most likely already lost. The key is to make sure he doesn't get there in the first place with coordination with your team and good positioning."
truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,13,Tue Jul 14 05:19:17 2015 UTC,Sadly once a scout is already in your face the only thing you can do is try and track him whilst screaming at team-mates.    However you can try and prevent yourself from getting in that situation by being aware of when the scout (or any flank class for that matter) might want to rush you.  If you manage to catch the scout before he gets to close range he is much easier to track as the further away he is from you the more he has to move in-game to move further in your POV (if that makes sense).    Long story short watch your surroundings to prevent flanks and track better to get scouts who are already close range.
truetf2,3d7wpx,Malice74,8,Tue Jul 14 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'm actually surprised by the comments cause they all make it sound like a Scout up close is a death sentence. Tracking one is still completely feasible, and often Scouts have jump patterns they're more used to and like to repeat. Met a Scout who'd jump in a triangle sort of shape every time; very effective initially but as I caught on it lost it's luster. A lot of Scouts try to jump over you so the moment I feel a Scout is going for that I ""overshoot"" and position my minigun shooting upward a split second before they even get there.  Really though I don't think there's much advice we can give. It's mostly tracking."
truetf2,3d7wpx,AFlyingNun,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"It's not impossible, but it's very difficult to track a target going over your head and behind you or even just strafing around you in a circle. I suppose that heavy mains with experience will know better than me but when I've played scout, it's always been a very easy fight once I'm jumping over a heavy's head."
truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"But I also think that ideally, the fight is still in Heavy's favor. Scout can only attempt to dodge, but whether or not the bullets actually hit is fully under Heavy's control and dependent on his capabilities. Ideally of course it's best when the Scout doesn't get close, but even then, it's not a clear victory for the Scout by any means. Jumping over the head for example, in my experience, becomes a 50-50 thing, because if the Heavy correctly guesses which way you rotate around afterwards, then it's still GG. If he guesses wrong however, then yes Scout has the window to clean up with. The jump itself won't always be a sinch, because as I said, it's very clear a lot of Scouts attempt to jump over the Heavy for this very reason, so I personally ""overshoot"" the moment I detect any forward momentum from them while jumping, and it actually tends to work out a lot.   Personally I love fighting Scouts as Heavy. It's great practice for both the Scout and the Heavy. It's a heated little fight that both gain experience from and have fun with. I will say though that in my experience, I typically win, probably at a ratio of 75-25 for when the Scout manages to get in close uncontested (aka no damage taken on the approach to close-range)"
truetf2,3d7wpx,AFlyingNun,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Ideally, the heavy will have control, but imagine a sniper fighting a scout at close range. Yeah, sometimes the sniper will have a great flickshot to get the scout, but the scout is quite favored. I think it's similar with heavy.   I'll defer to you here because you obviously have more experience with heavy than I do but I do think the scout should win if they get over the head of the heavy at all. At that point, even if the heavy manages to track the scout again, it's nigh impossible to keep a track of him while he strafes around you before he kills you."
truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"But with the Sniper, he has one shot per second or so, and he needs to hit a very specific area to deal enough damage for a kill; bodyshots uncharged won't do jack because the sniper will get ~50 damage per second to the Scout's 100 every half second.  With Heavy vs. Scout, Heavy is easily the best point blank damage output in the game, and he doesn't exactly need to be exact. The cone for bullet spray is quite large, with bullets being fired constantly, not to mention the Heavy is at an advantage thanks to his health pool. In a single second a Heavy can deal 500 damage, whereas Scout is gonna get out 105-210 damage at best.  Both of these classes are situational, with Heavy depending on positioning while Scout often wants to do cleanup or flank. Really, much like how the Soldier vs. Demo update was doable because neither class has a clear advantage over the other and how Spy vs. Engie might happen for the same reason, I think Heavy vs. Scout is another of these match-ups. However, I would also say that the majority of situations are in Heavy's favor, with Scout left to wait for an opportunity. And even then, if a 1v1 happens, Scout could be a world-class dodger, but that would still fail to a world-class tracker. Ultimately though, the skill demand on Scout is more tax. Scout needs to strafe, dodge, jump, move and still aim for ideal meatshots while doing all that. Heavy? He just has to track. It's easier on the Heavy, so you can consistently expect a good performance from the Heavy."
truetf2,3d7wpx,AFlyingNun,3,Tue Jul 14 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"You see, I can't see myself agreeing with that because the best heavies in the world will consistently lose to the best scouts in the world in close-range combat. I mean, ask any plat player and they'll agree. And really, scout doesn't need much tracking. The heavy is a still target. Movement isn't that hard to do.  It's much harder with sniper, I agree, but it was an exaggerated example. It's just that heavies have the same problem as sniper against scouts up close."
truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"Then what would you consider the win ratio between the two?  I think it's difficult to use examples anyways because both classes are again highly situational, not to mention in practical examples there's other concerns. For example I as a Heavy might not struggle with a Scout individually, but does killing one up close take some time? Yes. If I have a Scout on me while also being shot at by a demo from mid range, this is a problem. In that situation, the Scout will kill me; if not directly, then inadvertedly by buying enough time for the demo to get free hits in without the worry of me shooting him back.   I would agree it's not a clear-cut victory. As I said, if a Heavy vs Scout update came out, I think that'd be a really good, well-balanced match up because both of the classes can be very situational; a Scout has to avoid a spun down and prepared Heavy, but a Scout is gonna be a huge threat for Heavy during retreats. Still, I find the overwhelming voices that say imply is a nightmare scenario for Heavy to be a bit shocking. This is by no means a direct counter; it's a match-up where either could win."
truetf2,3d7wpx,AFlyingNun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"Heavy definitely has a chance, just not a good one. I'd say it's skewed like 75% to 25% in favor of the scout. This is assuming the scout gets point blank in the face at heavy before dying. If the heavy spots him at medium range, scout won't have a chance to get close without support."
truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"I still find this a bit hard to believe. From a purely mathematical perspective, if we're talking about a situation where Scout gets the drop on Heavy to the point where Scout is point blank but NOT directly behind Heavy (not directly in front either, but just somewhere where Heavy can see Scout), the math is 100% in Heavy's favor. If Heavy lands even 1/5th of his bullets per second, Scout will die. Human error is definitely a thing, but I find 75-25 in Scout's favor a bit dramatic. If a Scout can manage to jump over a Heavy and turn in one clean motion so that his aim is still fixated on the Heavy, I would expect a Heavy to be able to pull off the same. I loaded up TF2 and played a bit just to make sure I'm not crazy after hearing your input, in the hopes I'd find a decently skilled Scout. To be fair, yes of course this is a pub, but I actually was fortunate to find not one, but two in the first game I tried. One even went so far that he was simultaneously circling a level 3 sentry while destroying it and damaging a demo. Against both Scouts, my win ratio indeed felt like 75-25 in my favor. I did die plenty of times to them both, but those were to flanks, where they'd pop in behind me while I was busy or while I THOUGHT the 3 people behind me had my back. (ah pubs, you never cease to amaze) Saw the exact tactics I'd expect: first opportunity one got, they'd attempt an overhead jump, since landing on the other side of the Heavy obviously offers advantages. Each time though, I expected as much and could quickly kill them just by being ready for it; they'd have enough time to land, but upon landing they'd basically get blasted.  I realize of course this is a pub, but I only feel comfortable providing it as an example because it's very easy to recognize a scout that actually knows how to dodge worth a damn to tango with a heavy, and those scouts I've found everywhere, with results more or less the same regardless of the type of game. (pub, scrim, lobby, match) Also just a matter of course of being able to load up the game now and cross fingers for happening across a good one; the other game types can't just be found on a whim. :P  You mentioned plat Heavies would agree it's scout's advantage. Any examples of who? I'd be curious to ask them myself why they feel that way. I can definitely understand if someone wanted to argue it's 50-50 or 60-40 one way or the other, OR that in a practical sense, learning a Scout's loved jumping habits might not come as quickly as you'd like within a match, but as I said I'm still just really surprised to see so many people in this thread claim Scout's clear favor in the match up. Favor in flanking? Absolutely. Favor with Sandman? Totally. Favor if that Scout is stalking you and intent on killing you while you're distracted. Yep. But favor in a point-blank head to head...? Idunno, I still feel very much capable of tracking the little scamp."

truetf2,3d7wpx,neobowman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:27:20 2015 UTC,I mostly main Heavy and I feel bad for Scouts because of how OP the minigun is. Any class with less than 150 HP is gonna get shredded in a couple of seconds unless you have god-like dodging reflexes.
truetf2,3d7wpx,noscopecornshot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:26:49 2015 UTC,"For me the issue is not that you can't kill him, because you are probably going to shread him to bits. The issue is that he will deal 100 damage to you and as a Heavy you can't get hits like that if you want to win!"
truetf2,3d7wpx,ErikTwice,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:41 2015 UTC,"As a scout main, You have to know where the scout is before you can kill him. If he gets close to you without any teammates around you it's hard to get him. If you are spinned up by the time he gets to you, its a lot easier to kill a scout"
truetf2,3d7wpx,monkeyjedi12,2,Tue Jul 14 07:05:46 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said, the only time you'll be at an advantage is when you see him coming at mid-range.  At close range, you're pretty much screwed. Bear with me, but I find that randomly swirling my minigun in circles (in their general direction) when they're at close range does so much more than actually trying to track them. I've found that I more consistently win close-range 1v1s against scouts by swirling around as much as possible; if I recall correctly, at point-blank a single boolet does about 50 damage, so just hit a few and you're good. The swirling also confuses them because they don't know which way to dodge. You'll still probably lose most of the time though."
truetf2,3d7wpx,drschvantz,2,Tue Jul 14 11:01:08 2015 UTC,You could try using the Natasha. The slow devestates scouts and it is an all around decent option. Another idea would be to try changing your sense to see if that helps your tracking. Lastly just practicing vs scouts as a good portion of aiming vs scouts is prediction.
truetf2,3d7wpx,Karl_sagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"It's mostly going to be positioning and timing. You just can't let yourself get into situations where he can get the drop on you, because quick hit-and-run damage it what scout is supposed to be good at.  One good thing is not to peek without damage resistance. You completely lack the ability to dodge and can't really do real damage to anybody that isn't right in front of you, so just don't peek unless the intel you potentially gather is really worth it. You can peek with Fists of Steel a bit, since you have damage resistance to ranged and more mobility than when you're spun up, and I've found peeking with a spun-up Natascha to be acceptable when you know you won't enter a sniper sightline (for example, peeking into garden from glassworks 2nd).  As far as tracking goes, the only things you can do are practice and improve your fps. I use a 16:9 monitor running Chris' highframes config on a new, but cheap desktop. My game looks like butt (and I'm talking George R.R. Martin cottage-cheese butt, not Chris Hemsworth nice tan fleshmelons butt), but it runs smoothly at 120 frames.  Since it received a buff in the recent update, I've found Natascha to be a 100% viable and awesome weapon. It's pretty much my main minigun now. You trade some damage potential for being tankier and better at 1v1s because the enemy can't dodge or escape. You also become excellent at denying bombers."

truetf2,3d7wpx,reticulan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:34:29 2015 UTC,assess the situation. Fight or flight. work on your tracking and positioning to arm yourself against those scouts.
truetf2,3d7wpx,kkaltuu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"It's the natural cycle of TF2, not much you can do about it. If you're dying too much to scouts finishing you off, maybe your positioning isn't the best? Or perhaps it's your damage taken? It's fine to tank damage for your team when you can, but you shouldn't let it result in your death. You might also want to tell your combo to help you out, your pyro can create some breathing room though airblasting implies a potential escape and/or damage output reduction. You're not a one-man army (heh).  When you face a scout, you should ALWAYS keep in mind that he can, and will jump at any time. Their path is pre-determined when they jump, so with a bit of practice you can easily handle any jumpy scout. Of course, you shouldn't be the only one trying to kill the scout, but it never hurts to survive one. Please look into a high fps config even if it makes your game look like crap, the result is much smoother and allows for much, much better tracking. You could also pub around like /u/Karl_sagan suggested as Heavy to train your tracking on scouts."
truetf2,3d7wpx,cortanavicortania,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"As a scout my main offensive strategy on heavies is to jump into his face and wreak havoc, since the update a lot of heavies switch to natasha/tommislav when scout keeps getting in their face, both weapons deal with the scout pretty easily."

I don't know what kind of sensitivity you play with, but when I main heavy my sensitivity is way up so I can track pesky Scouts with minimum effort.   I find Pyros to be far more challenging since their skill level doesn't need to be anywhere near the Scout's to still be a problem (due to their higher base health), and once you've copped that point-blank fire damage, it can be tricky to wipe the player out and still have time to sneak around the corner for a sandvich before you're roasted."

Here's a video by StabbyStabby about backstab registration The higher your ping, the worse it's going to affect you.  You can totally get into HL with 100+ ping. With higher ping though, you're naturally not going to be as good as you are on lower ping so  technically, yeah, it's going to affect which teams pick you.  It's much easier to play hitscan on higher ping, especially Sniper, which sometimes has an advantage at around 100 ping. I know a couple snipers, who play at that level and do very well. If you do want to play Spy though, I suggest skewing your weapon usage to your gun rather than your knife."
truetf2,3da6dy,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"If you're playing hitscan it won't matter much   I would probably avoid classes like spy, pyro, soldier, demo   Other than that you're good"
truetf2,3dax1q,philip003,14,Tue Jul 14 21:22:40 2015 UTC,They have different speeds and playstyles and you're used to one. It's like saying why you're good at football but suck at baseball. Sure there are some transferable skills but they're different.  Direct hit is very situational. Practice with the stock or original if you have to choose. It shouldn't be a problem to practice both though.
truetf2,3dax1q,neobowman,15,Tue Jul 14 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"The direct hit is easy and fairly overpowered in 1v1s, but you're giving up your ability to splash, which means it's bad for fighting teams or making space/spamming in chokes. You will have better and more helpful damage output in actual games with stock, but win in MGE with direct hit.  Edit: I forgot to say that while DH is actually viable at low levels, you'll never improve past low levels while using a such a gimmicky playstyle."
truetf2,3dax1q,fatswimdude,2,Tue Jul 14 21:52:35 2015 UTC,Direct Hit is stronger against Soldiers and Heavies who are slow and have large hitbox compared to the rest of classes. If you try to kill Medic dancing with A/D using DH and stock and see which nets you more kills per minute you will understand why stock is considered good.

truetf2,3dax1q,Fizzyfloat,2,Wed Jul 15 07:45:29 2015 UTC,"If you're good with direct hit, fantastic! Use it. Just be aware that in competitive play, spam plays a big element of holding choke points and doing small bits of damage at a distance. If you're running DH then your other soldier and demo will have to compensate in stalemates which might hurt your team.  I say might, you also might find you have great success in comp and are a credit to team. Only way to find out is to play :)"

truetf2,3dax1q,Bronan_the_Brobarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:44 2015 UTC,The DH is just better for 1v1s. People don't use it in games because it can't do a lot of really important things that don't relate to fighting 1v1s.
truetf2,3dax1q,ApathyPyramid,0,Wed Jul 15 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"DH is a 1v1 crutch, faster and more direct applied damage to a single target you don't have to play with splash and angles as much with it so you can just shoot. Because of that it's near useless in games past like a steel level but will work really well in MGE. So use it if you want but keep in mind that you are really just wasting your time with it or whoring for ELO, so don't expect to get better."

truetf2,3d7d6q,aoid,4,Tue Jul 14 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"You think pushing out of last is clear? I'm not trying to be facetious, I'm genuinely asking.   You have 3 options to push from. And you have to have someone watching last because of the way last is designed, so you're always pushing with at least one person down.   The first place we will try to push is shutter. You're standing in two OP sightlines (truck to your right and that far left flank which is very passive but super strong) and you have severe height disadvantage. You can get flanked from anywhere and everywhere if you push shutter too. Not to mention spies dropping on the combo from catwalk, etc. That push is no good.   Next is the far left. This is what I assume is the obvious place to push from. My major gripe is that it has several choke points so small that a pyro can m2 a whole team really, really easily at multiple stages of a team pushing out. Not to mention being juggled by a demo or solly. It leaves you to either uber early thru the choke OR eat a sticky trap/pyro hitting m2 while having your combo flanked from behind from lobby. You're also staring down their sniper sitting in left flank (again, trying to stress how difficult this sniper is to push. He's essentially standing on mid and even if most of his team is down, he can be almost immediately be protected by spawns). The other team can kite your uber into garden (a quick rotation that gives them height advantage) and counter with the best uber of their life. We just used uber to push thru one choke but we generally didn't have enough manpower/ammo to push to mid. Pushing out of last on this map generally required using uber to get thru the chokes which gave them advantage and teams normally rolled that momentum into last when they pushed back in with their team.   Third place to push from is the far right, supreme height disadvantage as well as nowhere near the objective. You have to put yourself in harms way of the same sightlines if you would've pushed out of shutter.  huge flanks with height disadvantage nowhere near the objective or the chokiest of chokes. That's what it felt like. More of a pick your poison more so than a clear choice for pushing out of last. Unless you get a wipe or drastic number advantage, it felt impossible to push out. Maybe I missed out on how to play this map tho."
truetf2,3d7d6q,flick-,4,Tue Jul 14 14:10:54 2015 UTC,Why would you be pushing out of last if you're even in players?
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,4,Tue Jul 14 14:26:57 2015 UTC,"Im suggesting how you would push out of last with uber advantage. Otherwise your team is sitting on last, waiting for their sniper to take shots on your medic and the spy to keep making a play. 5cp in HL!"
truetf2,3d7d6q,flick-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"If you have uber ad, go in with a scout and demo top left, get everyone else to clear other chokes."
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we will have to agree to disagree here, but a good pyro can shut down any attempts to effectively uber thru the left side. Even with a scout in on the uber, it slows your push down and leaves you susceptible to one of the strongest sightlines in the game. Not to mention sticky traps for days that you're pushing through.   I recognize that pushing out of last is not impossible. My problem is that it was improbable, especially with the potential for backcaps.   It's also really hard to hold second, what you're tasked with after pushing out of last, but I don't wanna go into that. I just think pushing out of last is even more asinine than holding second and almost always put you in a bad situation and requires the other team to fuck up massively.   Edit: I wish we had more discussions like this! Or breakdowns of the map. I feel like they're beneficial and can show teams different perspectives for pushing/holding/defending points."
truetf2,3d7d6q,flick-,2,Tue Jul 14 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree that we should agree to disagree. With a scout in the uber, pyro should buy at most 2 seconds. That's plenty of time to push into their combo. If their combo is so far back that you cant reach them, you shouldn't have to uber into the pyro at first. Whichever sticktraps there are shouldn't matter if you're ubering into them.  The sniper sightline is not really that relevant. If you get the frags on their combo, you will be able to push the sniper without much difficulty.  Backcaps can be problematic but if you stick your engineer at last, you should generally be alright.  You say pushing out of last is hard. You are right. The thing is that this is true for every map, not just glassworks. I don't believe it's significantly harder to push out of than say, process. You just have to be careful with clearing here."
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:36 2015 UTC,"....the sniper sightline isn't relevant? One of (if not THE) strongest one in the map? Please explain how you came to this conclusion.   And TWO SECONDS is an eternity for a team to leave. And two seconds is being generous. A good pyro can milk the corner airblast for longer than two seconds unless they're braindead. The opposing team should already be passive if they know you have advantage. Are you gonna go chase those frags (which you spent flashing the scout in to get the pyro and then the demo so he doesn't drop to a trap) chasing them into garden? Where they now have advantage?? That's a wipe waiting to happen.   How do you suggest pushing thru traps? They need to be cleared or det. Especially in that tight ass corridor.   Edit: and an engi watching last being ""generally alright"" is a lost round if you're not careful. If the spy and solly get behind you with the ample amount f flanks, you're down a round. Cool."
truetf2,3d7d6q,flick-,2,Tue Jul 14 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"If they're down combo classes, you can easily jump in your demo into the sniper or your scout or your soldier or your spy into him.  If you have a good scout, he should be able to get the pyro within 3 shots. Also, the first corrider should not be stocked up because your team should have control of it. If their team is holding back enough that your scout can't reach them with the uber on the pyro, then you don't need to uber on the pyro. You should be able to get the demo or med with a half decent uber.  Traps are completely irrelevant when you're ubered. I don't know why your bring it up.  Of course if a spy and apply get behind your entire team onto last, you're probably dead. That goes for literally every map, not just glassworks. If your team can coordinate their push out from last with people clearing lobby and lower, it shouldn't be much of a big deal. Backcaps are more prevalent on glassworks than other maps but the push out with uber ad shouldn't be that much more problematic than on other maps."

truetf2,3d7d6q,fatmoonkins,3,Tue Jul 14 15:13:33 2015 UTC,Jeez. Make sure you lock some good subs by the end of the 14th.
truetf2,3d7d6q,aoid,3,Tue Jul 14 03:53:12 2015 UTC,We have subs but I didn't know our engi was going to be gone today until ~5 minutes before the pregame scrim and our demo had to leave for 6s scrims. :(
truetf2,3d7d6q,fatmoonkins,3,Tue Jul 14 04:00:11 2015 UTC,I AM SORRY FOR NOT MAKING IT FRIENDS
truetf2,3d7d6q,Rankuu,4,Tue Jul 14 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"UGC Iron  The Watchmen vs KonfusedKobs  I don't know how I feel about our win. Our sniper just got a new PC and has been playing everything but TF2 for the past week only playing tf2 a half hour, before going to play something else. An hour before the match he wasn't in mumble, instead he was playing Payday 2. This led us to get a sub sniper and he absolutely carried. I think we could've won without this sub, but he just went off on the enemy team. He ended with 130 points. While I do think we could've won without him, it just feels dirty to say the least.  5-1  Edit:sniper was hacking... gg, Moral of the story is don't trust suspicious subs"
truetf2,3d7d6q,monkeyjedi12,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:02 2015 UTC,The problem is (at least I think) we have no idea how we could have done as the sub was so insanely amazing. I'd love to keep him as it gives me a whole level of motivation to get the good. <3 I still think overall we did well.
truetf2,3d7d6q,-Cwap,4,Tue Jul 14 17:48:46 2015 UTC,You have a relatively easy final match. You should be fine.  The results were a big surprise because you guys crushed us pretty handily in our prescrim and we did okay against MTN in the scrim we had against them.  Your semi-cap on last every time really got to us. The half-captime is really a huge deal.
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,5,Tue Jul 14 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"NA Iron (The Newblings vs Stupid is Cool)  We lost 0-5 in like 10 minutes. Stupid is cool doesn't belong in Iron. First time playing an actual match with this new team, and it was fun in general. All that matters. We played way too passively, and had many chances to push back and stop them from capping last, but we never took any of those changes.  First half || Second half  On a different note; fuck 5CP in highlander."
truetf2,3d7d6q,VintageMerryweather,9,Tue Jul 14 04:17:13 2015 UTC,"NA Steel, Egg Salad Dressing (us) vs. Fucked in the Head CoinOp.  We ultimately lost 3-2, but it was one of those games where you didn't mind who won or lost.  We didn't scrim, and a few players on our team had literally never played the map before. We also didn't have our main Scout (due to him being on vacation) nor our Soldier for having a family emergency, so we had a ringer who did fantastic given that he couldn't connect to Mumble, just downloaded the map a few minutes before, and pretty much went in blind most of the time :/ He did embarassingly good without comms because he wasn't afraid of getting in deep on pushes or playing passive, which we totally have struggled with.  First half went 2-1 in our favor. We got the last win with around three minutes left on the clock. Second half they were able to blitz through two wins via momentum and back caps, and subsequently we spent the last round with mid and usually second capped, but we could not cap last. One part that was FITH CoinOp having a good defense, another it was our inability to push because we're a group of b4ddies.  I dominated their Medic, but our Medic dropped like a sack of potatoes. I'unno.  I have to stress that while we would have definitely preferred a win, the match was so fun that we walked out with moderately happier spirits. Morale was certainly higher than when we lost at Asheville and Steel.  I'm not a big fan of cp_glassworks. It's so freakish huge and hard to lock down areas, it's almost as bad as cp_steel. The only credit I give glassworks is that the map isn't a real Sniper carry map, like practically every single map in the season is. (Oh, look, next week is Lakeside, another Sniper carry map).  So that puts us at 4-3. Unfortunate, but given that it's still our first season and we had two subs, I think we're doing fiiiiiiine.  No logs, I couldn't find them on logs.tf and SizzlingStats is so garbage a placeholder I'd rather just wait."
truetf2,3d7d6q,TheYellowCellPhone,8,Tue Jul 14 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"We actually aren't the FITH team, we're the COIN team, although it is confusing since some of us wear the FITH community tag. That was probably the most fun game we played this season. You guys were really hard to push out of final as well (did we ever actually succeed? Don't think so)  I was the spy and I have to give you credit man did you get a really good point blank shot on me (and good performance overall)"
truetf2,3d7d6q,NamesNStuff,8,Tue Jul 14 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"Whoops, sorry, my mistake.  You guys are a blast. I know you had me dominated most of the first half, and kept getting our Medic. We keep saying it's our Pyro not being attentive, I thought it was just you reading the plays and reacting to it. Good on you, hope you guys the best on Lakeside.  EDIT: Also your headshots were off the hook. I wish I had the logs, but I'd easily believe you had more headshots than your Sniper."
truetf2,3d7d6q,TheYellowCellPhone,5,Tue Jul 14 05:34:09 2015 UTC,"Your pyro was wrecking shop.    Our sniper, ninjamoocow, is an idiot.  He just holds down the attack button until all of his ammo is gone.  Last night he just got lucky.  :O)"
truetf2,3d7d6q,Spreadsheeticus,2,Tue Jul 14 06:59:15 2015 UTC,"We call him our shitwizard. Stubbornly refuses to use the Degreaser, thinks it's unfun to go against so he doesn't use it. I was hoping a season of HL would beat the advantages of the Degreaser into him, but he's topfragged at least one half in every match."
truetf2,3d7d6q,TheYellowCellPhone,2,Tue Jul 14 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"Typical steel pyro mindset.    He's got great reflect skill and makes great use of the scorch shot. His overall damage for both halves was very high for pyro.    After this last wave of changes, I think we're starting to see some players switching to vanilla flame thrower and using the detonator/scorch shot, which were previously just gimmicky."
truetf2,3d7d6q,Spreadsheeticus,9,Tue Jul 14 19:17:32 2015 UTC,"NA Silver Roadkill  vs. Daycare Center  RK 5-0 DC  Going into the match there was a few people on the forums that predicted us to get rolled, but we rolled them the other way. Leading up to the match we did well in scrims and had a great map review that really helped along with TMP's knowledge of the game. We played coordinated and our flank was incredible.  As for me, I usually hate 5cp as engie and I did poorly in scrims leading up, but I managed to tie second frag with our heavy behind our pyro.   Stats for the first half only, second half was short and only one round"
truetf2,3d7d6q,fatmoonkins,3,Tue Jul 14 19:28:24 2015 UTC,How did TMP get more damage than your demo...? He's such a scary pyro holy shit.
truetf2,3d7d6q,MAxichan,5,Tue Jul 14 02:27:49 2015 UTC,He's our hard carry.
truetf2,3d7d6q,MAxichan,5,Tue Jul 14 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"Haven't been following the silver scene too much, but always been a tmp fan; how did he end up on y'all's team?"
truetf2,3d7d6q,aoid,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:11 2015 UTC,Our leader played a lobby with him and just straight up asked him.
truetf2,3d7d6q,MuEtaJenkins,3,Tue Jul 14 06:33:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool.  I just remember that he used to play plat."
truetf2,3d7d6q,disciplinedragon,5,Tue Jul 14 11:53:42 2015 UTC,"TMP is a monster. He fits with the ultra-skilled, agressive pyro type and plays it so well."
truetf2,3d7d6q,Dovahk1in,3,Tue Jul 14 13:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, he also basically main calls for us so we've become a really aggressive team."
truetf2,3d7d6q,Piperita,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'm DC's solly - TMP was making it very difficult for me to get much done in terms of flanks/bombs.  At least I got your med a couple of times.  I think it's crazy that you guys are playing with a Plat pyro, but good luck with the rest of the season."
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 11:54:16 2015 UTC,He hasn't played in play for a few seasons and a few gold players said he was silver level so he said fuck it and went silver.  Also our flank was pretty strong the entire match so I wouldn't blame everything on TMP.
truetf2,3d7d6q,guyofred,4,Tue Jul 14 16:14:55 2015 UTC,"HP vs BBB UGC Steel  Overall a great match, lost 4-0 but we took the full times each time. Some close back and forth and overall a really fun match. Had some insane plays all around from both teams.  Not too upset at the loss since they're our scrim partners so no hard feelings."
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,4,Tue Jul 14 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"NA Iron  GG. vs TFO  We (TFO) won by a very tiny, tiny margin. First half we won 1 - 0. Second half we tied 2 - 2. It took way too long. Great game to GG, but holy crap that map sucked balls. Neither of our teams pushed well onto last. We would go back and forth to each others' lasts, never able to fully cap it."
truetf2,3d7d6q,guyofred,5,Tue Jul 14 03:00:17 2015 UTC,"NA Steel, Animal House! vs Emotional Goats. We won 3-2, but it was super stalemate-y.  I was a bit nervous going in because 5cp has always been our worst map type and we lost every single scrim on this map in the past week. We managed to make some readjustments with the combo though, and that allowed us to hold at an uber disadvantage and actually push into last successfully. I played pretty terribly and missed the easiest flares (no double reflect kill on the flank for me today...), but our comms were better (minus one incident when our medic got successfully bombed in front of the entire combo + engie... he was just like, we're not ever going to mention what just happened, because I have no words).  My medic and I live together, and I kept lagging during our pre-match and first half so we tried to reset our router in case that was the problem and then our medic couldn't connect to the internet again. Emotional Goats guys were very polite and allowed us extra time to figure out what the hell was going on. Didn't solve the issue anyways, I lagged again during the second half, but oh well..."
truetf2,3d7d6q,cpugpuhelp,3,Tue Jul 14 05:29:36 2015 UTC,"NA Gold vs. Gib Rex.  After 2 quick rounds, we had a lot of trouble in the 3rd round and it went really back and forth. Eventually got it and took the last 2 rounds after we switched out our med for a sub after our main med spiked his ping to over 1000. 5-0.  But Wow. Gold. So many upsets. Tonight was absolutely crazy."
truetf2,3d7d6q,neobowman,2,Tue Jul 14 17:30:25 2015 UTC,Any examples? Glassworks is a shitty map for HL and its new so I could see a lot those happening.
truetf2,3d7d6q,pink_rapefruit,3,Tue Jul 14 03:02:18 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's a bad map. It is new though so lots of teams will not be prepared for everything on it.  MTN beat Pepe 5-2.  Bonus beat IFA 5-2.  QTs beat WYKD 5-4 (This one's especially heartbreaking because WYKD lost the last week's match 4-3 after being up 3-0 in half).
truetf2,3d7d6q,Tomfoster1,6,Tue Jul 14 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"Ouch, IFA and WYKD. I would not have expected IFA to lose. I actually take back what I said about glassworks. These upsets are delicious."
truetf2,3d7d6q,MeetUrDo0m,2,Tue Jul 14 03:11:57 2015 UTC,Gold is just weak this season.
truetf2,3d7d6q,ItsJigsore,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's really that much weaker than last season and even if it was, I don't really think it matters as to if teams are getting upset."

The Server crashed on us part way through, but the other team was gracious enough to allow us the win.  PanHandlers doesn't always have their head in the game, but when we actually work together we can pull a win easily.  I managed to figure out how to work with the new engineer balance during this match, and I feel like I played very well. Things work very differently than they did before so I'm proud that I was able to perform effectively without a guideline, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to come up with my own strategies. It gives me the room to really test my mettle as an engineer main."
truetf2,3d7d6q,Iustinus,3,Tue Jul 14 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"NA Steel (Original Name vs The Yellow Pubmarine) Game ended at 4 - 2 First half 1 - 0 their favor Second half 4 - 1 our favor.    The first half, they took advantage of the momentum they had and they rolled through the next two points. After we lost that round it was an endless mid fight. We ended up capping second and trying to rush last with less than 15 seconds to go. Our flank (which I'm included in) wasn't communicating well with itself for that first half.    In the second half after we decided to switch it up, we kept the scout out of garage and spiral with a mini so our sniper wasn't getting decimated in barn and I kept their soldier off the roof to the best of my abilities, after we got those two picks it was easier to win mid and gain control of garden/yard/left lobby. We coordinated pushes better by waiting for our spy or sniper to get that good pick (a dropped medic, heavy, soldier even) and stopped trying to abuse pushing through water (that flooded route under last), any time I saw our scout starting to flank I went with him and we did better with those small encounters.    TL;DR First half we weren't together at all, second half we splashed some water in our faces and started working together as a team and it was still a great and challenging game either way.    First Half | Second Half"

truetf2,3d2hot,Rankuu,57,Mon Jul 13 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"I have personally thought of Jordan as being the best engineer in NA for a long while. Jordan introduced me to highlander and comp and I joined his team in season 6. Jordan has always been one of the smartest players around. There isn't a class he can't play at a high plat level. He also has extremely good shotgun aim, and it's really hard to catch him off guard, as he's extremely aware. He's also a really relaxed, laid back guy. He never gets frustrated and always provides intel and smart suggestions throughout games. I think his versatility and skill at other classes are what enable him to be so good as a player, and then combined with his DM and his previous engineer experience, he is one of the best there is."

Being in enough tourneys you get to see the cool consistent headspace of the pros.    He's got the winner's headspace, top shelf game knowledge, and a practiced hand."

The funny thing about Jordan is he never really intends to play Engie, but somehow ends up there by the end of the season. It's happened a few seasons now, but this season has been especially hilarious. Our Plat team was plagued with roster and availability issues, so Jordan started the season scrimming as Heavy, then was swapped to Scout for the first match, Solly for Week 2, Sniper and Solly equally for Week 3, and by Week 5 was on Engineer (where he'll be through at least tonight's Week 7 match).  He's an incredibly versatile as well as humble player, which is probably why he rings more than a bananaphone."

Most soldiers (more pro ones) will tend to wait for a scout to finish his double jump to hit a solid rocket or will play back waiting for the scout to over-aggress as trying to out range a scout or kill a scout from 100% to 0 with shotgun is really hard. With liberty launcher, and the much needed added speed to deal with such good scout movement, scout will have a much harder time dealing with the soldier using it. So... if you take in the fact that liberty launcher deals less damage and I think... (not sure) it has a lower splash range? (big if about that, I think they've changed it), scout will require much more precise strafes and play much much more disciplined and avoid w+m1ing when they can. If you play at medium - sorta long range, you can still chip at a soldier like you generally would if they were running regular rockets. You can still +foward them if they're low but, you have to be careful as it's much easier for them to just bop + bop how they see fit (rocket + shotgun or rocket + rocket orrrr rocket + melee). It's not that super broken but against newer scouts it'll seem broken as good movement is always key, I do predict it'll be nerfed though, this seems to good to be true sorta like maybe it'll go back to it's original splash range which I think previously was small.  edit: Think of it this way, if a soldier has trouble hitting directs on you with the direct hit when you play back, they'll have trouble with the liberty launcher. The LL is just a mix of the RL / DH so just treat it how it is and play around it."
truetf2,3d0gq7,BW_Yodo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"I like this change, as it stops scouts from playing recklessly over-aggressive which most of the time they're allowed to."
truetf2,3d0gq7,BluntTruthGentleman,3,Mon Jul 13 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it is not a scout-killer weapon. Lower damage is a big con, so as long as you don't take directs you will be fine. The are no need for counter, just play as you usually do."
truetf2,3d0gq7,12_Angry_Fremen,4,Sun Jul 12 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"It also runs well with shotgun for long fights, as the reduced rocket jump damage and 5th rocket means you can jump without worrying about self-harm (don't need gunboats) and have plenty of firepower to deal with people.  I use shotty defensively and LL offensively."
truetf2,3d0gq7,Ax2u,3,Sun Jul 12 16:54:50 2015 UTC,LL seems really viable now. Paired with the gunboots I can consistently hit 11-12 hp rocket jumps. That fifth rocket is super nice to have as well (and no heads BS like the airstrike). The 40% speed is a perfect medium between DH and stock. Good for slapping scouts but not too fast to be unwieldly.

truetf2,3d0gq7,NeXuid,2,Sun Jul 12 19:53:49 2015 UTC,The faster it is the better tracking you need. I prefer to shoot where the enemy will be than where he is at the moment. Somehow that's easier for me idk.

truetf2,3d0gq7,Stormwatch36,-2,Mon Jul 13 13:03:29 2015 UTC,There's a thing called muscle memory. You definitely aren't taking it into account.
truetf2,3d0gq7,wwilly,4,Mon Jul 13 03:54:19 2015 UTC,You can have different muscle memories for different circumstances. Do you play like an engie when you go scout?
truetf2,3d0gq7,Stormwatch36,-5,Mon Jul 13 04:15:03 2015 UTC,What do you mean by playing like Engie as Scout?
truetf2,3d0gq7,wwilly,6,Mon Jul 13 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"When you change classes, a whole new set of muscle memories takes over. Rocket jumping only applies when you're a soldier. Double jumping only applies when you're a scout. The same can be true for weapons. You treat a mini-sentry differently than its big brother, and you kill with the force-a-nature differently than you do with the stock scattergun. Your muscle memory has no problem with these differences in playstyle, because you have different muscle memories for different things. You can practice and hone the difference between the liberty launcher and stock in the same way you learn a different class."
truetf2,3d0gq7,Stormwatch36,0,Mon Jul 13 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"You can downvote me as much as you like, but I'm still gonna stay by my own opinion. When you've played a lot with stock it's going to be hard to do well with Liberty Launcher. It's not like you're playing a different class. You're playing the same class, shooting the same projectiles, but which move slightly faster. I'd say it's much easier to switch from stock to Direct Hit for a while, because DH's rockets are moving significantly faster (+80% is huge) and your brain will count it as something completely different from stock and will develop a different muscle memory when you equip it. However, the difference between projectile speed of stock and Liberty Launcher is very small so you will not start developing a different muscle memory when you switch to it unlike Direct Hit. That's how I think all this stuff works.  And oh, there's no difference between aiming with Engie's Shotgun and Scout's Scattergun if you're relying on tracking, not on muscle memory based flicks."
truetf2,3d0gq7,wwilly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:22:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally downvoted you even once, just to make that clear.  Getting back to it, maybe it's a personal thing. I can only go by my personal experience, but I'm competent with both launchers. Of course I'm better with stock at this point, but I only just started using the LL when Gun Mettle dropped. In my mind I'm still working on the LL, and it'll take quite a while to get it up to the same level. I'm not going to just go ""well my muscle memory"" and toss it aside after only poking it for like ten days.   it's much easier to switch from stock to Direct Hit for a while, because DH's rockets are moving significantly faster   The key word here is easier. I'm not trying to imply that it's easy to get used to both launchers, not at all. What I'm saying is that it can be done if you are willing to put in the time. The model is different, the sound effect is different, and the rocket's behavior is different, but you need to spend the time practicing it if you want your brain and hands to be able to realize all that on the fly. If you don't want to practice, you're right, you'll never be able to get past your current muscle memory, because it takes time to do that."
truetf2,3d0gq7,Popnomatron,0,Mon Jul 13 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"Wasn't exactly referring to you when said about downvotes, nothing personal.  In my opinion it's not really worth pratcicing a lot with LL as it will not develop a different muscle memory (like with DH), but will ""overwrite"" the muscle memory you've developed using stock RL and a big other variety of Soldier primaries (Black Box, Cowmangler, Air Strike (the latter looks like a really strong roamer weapon after the update and could get some use if it's going to get unbanned in 6s))."

truetf2,3d0gq7,BW_Yodo,0,Sun Jul 12 22:38:22 2015 UTC,increased blast radius and/or increased knockback  The second one would even help with rocket jumping.
truetf2,3d0gq7,MovkeyB,3,Sun Jul 12 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"In most cases this additional rocket  just used to compensate lover damage, but it takes more time to fire all of them, which give additional time for your enemy to kill you. I prefer to kill targets faster.  I think it is close to DH in terms of usage, you really need to hit very close rockets or directs with it to make it viable. I used it on roamer and there were plenty of situations where I hit med with 70+60 instead of 90+70. But you can make double/triple jumps for bombing, could see a play on map like process.  Overall it was not as good as I thought, and I prefer shotgun to clear scouts."

truetf2,3d0gq7,NotTerryCrews,-8,Mon Jul 13 19:12:55 2015 UTC,That's like saying the LnL is viable because it can get scouts easily. A pocket's mission isn't to exclusively kill scouts and the shotgun and RL are enough most of the time.
truetf2,3d0gq7,liuwqf,7,Sun Jul 12 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"A pocket protects the medic, which is often threatened by scouts  5 hard-to-dodge rockets make that much easier, especially as the meta's shifted to centralize scouts more."
truetf2,3d0gq7,fatswimdude,-5,Sun Jul 12 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"Of course. But 4 well placed rockets and shotgun is enough. It just sounds like a crutch for pockets who can't protect their medic with the typical loadout, but I'm not sure about how I'd go using the term crutch because it would probably make good pockets better and bad ones better as well. ""Oh you're using the LL because you probably can't use the RL and Shotgun against scouts"" would be semi-valid because you'd see good pockets use that stuff as well. I'm not saying the LL is shit for pocket but it's like comparing the LnL (before the update) to the LL (after the update) really. You won't only have scouts attacking your medic, demos, enemy sollies will still jump your med into oblivion, that's for anyone who ever played a 6s scrim.  I don't get today's mentality. People always speak of centralizing the meta on scouts, but in all reality and with no offense meant it's just talk. Sure scouts are getting stronger but they're not gods for crying outloud, competent pockets can take care of scouts with the heals they're getting and with good rockets/shotty shots. Scouts have more power because they're more mobile and can deal a constant amount of damage over time without really taking much spam, sure, but a good pocket or even roamer can reposition to take care of that. What do you do when you see a scout coming as sniper? You take a corner and wait for them to turn, they'll probably double jump that's when you take the flickshot, works most of the time. In the end centralizing scouts is just about giving them much more heals and I've done that quite often with one scout, still got destroyed when he'd try to force the enemy medic because the demo saw him coming and the pocket pretty much predicted his movement. It can work but good scouts exist as good pockets exist too. It's not if we see it in popular games that scouts are strong that the meta is about scouts now.  I might get downvoted but when one would speak of the LL in the past, when it was not comparable to the LnL in terms of killing scouts (which is, VERY easy), people would just mock him and tell him to go pub around. Just saying folks."
truetf2,3d0gq7,liuwqf,9,Sun Jul 12 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're not playing the right teams. Good scouts play with their team, waiting for damage or bombs from the explosive classes before fighting the combo."
truetf2,3d0gq7,fatswimdude,-3,Sun Jul 12 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like most people aren't playing the right teams, with due respect. I know you're someone who knows what they speak of, but there are good pockets, excellent ones out there who can take care of 'great' scouts. And even then it's not about the DM, you can gain height advantage and abuse a non-splash position. Good scouts? Yep, they play with their team, or one scout sticks to the combo and another can exchange frags for a more significant pick, or even force the med by surprise. I'm playing the right teams though because I've given my scouts tons of heals time and over and they got good shit done, but the explosive classes took advantage of many things like territorial control and height advantage, setting up traps, luring those good scouts in chokes, and by good scouts I mean scouts that actually get something special done. I don't mean to shit on scout, quite the opposite, but people speak as if they're invincible."

I'm not sure how advantages it is vs the repercussions of not using stock though, really something I would need to play to get a feel for.  The mobile attack unit is a little bit redundant at this point seeing as a part of the update just overhauled engie to the point that good eniges essentially can actually be this mobile now.

When you can just build with a Scout or shoot rockets at your feet and be prepared for if someone decides to attack you and you can be ready and not take mini crits for 3 seconds even after you switch away
truetf2,3cx4ra,Maxillaws,7,Sat Jul 11 17:50:10 2015 UTC,"Trade-off of using up far less ammo and not snaking someone off of the flank. A scout building is a scout not watching for flankers or able to shoot jumpers. It's an option now, and while it's not 100% undeniably the best thing to do at all times, it's still a viable thing to do."
truetf2,3cx4ra,Shady_Love,-2,Sat Jul 11 17:54:26 2015 UTC,There is generally a Scout that stays with the combo and you don't build close to a choke usually so a Scout would be able to see or get a call out for a bomber and be able to switch to his scattergun.  It really isn't viable.  You are underestimating the point of having to hold out a melee as soldier that causes you to take mini crits even after putting it away
truetf2,3cx4ra,Maxillaws,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:45 2015 UTC,And you're overestimating weapon swap times and how much the mini crits will actually matter as a pocket who won't be near enemies.  Why can the scout in your scenario switch from melee but the soldier can't?
truetf2,3cx4ra,Shady_Love,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:46:27 2015 UTC,I know the Soldier can switch away but when he does switch away he takes mini crits for 3 seconds which means 135% damage with no fall off so if he gets peaked by a Soldier or a Demo hits him with asticky he'll be hurt bad.  A soldier spamming chokes during stalemates is better than a Scout just running around doing 3 damage shots to people
truetf2,3cx4ra,Maxillaws,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Spam is overrated.   Scouts don't build where they can be seen easily or quickly hit, a soldier would do the same."
truetf2,3cx4ra,Shady_Love,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:39 2015 UTC,"The Boston basher gives you the bleed debuff which is bad once the medic reaches 80% and wants to stop healing him.  It's a difference between having to heal/buff the scout to remove the debuff in addition to buffing everyone else, or to use escape plan/equalizer which will activate crit heals as soon as he switches to another weapon.   Not to mention, if a roamer catches a scout building with a medic he has a much higher success rate of killing the scout (and maybe medic) than a 200 health soldier that is slowly gaining hp over time."

truetf2,3cy6cx,4812622,8,Sun Jul 12 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"If you don't know where your combo is holding, that is a problem with poor team communication. Medics should be calling when they rotate to a different area of the map. With that said, you actually have to listen for these calls and be aware that most medics might not say it loudly if at all. It's up to you to turn around and to ask if you can't find them."
truetf2,3cy6cx,Crayboff,3,Sun Jul 12 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"While you're respawning, flip through the PoV's of your teammates so you can know what's going on (you might find out where your combo is heading that way).  If it's a matter of being separated (which happens, on occasion... a good pyro won't be up the medic's ass 24/7, that's inefficient), first check to make sure that they're actually still up, and then ask where they are.  Honestly lobbies are kind of a clusterfuck in terms of comms because there's almost never anyone willing to take charge and maincall (and if there is, it's a crapshot as to whether anyone actually listens - gotta coddle them egos), important information gets left out all the time, and some people just straight-up don't do their job, opting to chase glory instead of holding a line. Then they of course die and whatever they were fighting just continues chewing through the rest of the team like pac man on steroids, and they won't own up to it because it means admitting that they screwed up."

truetf2,3cy6cx,Piperita,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:03:38 2015 UTC,"Mmmm... my mentor tells me that pubs are actually fine for practicing DM for pyro. IDK how much you can learn from trying to play pocket pyro in a pub, but I've definitely made mini games for myself in pubs like ""this medic doesn't die until the round ends"" or something, just for fun.  Lobbies are really just a pub where the average skill level is higher and people talk and decide to work together more often, so they're probably a bit more beneficial when it comes to your DM/situational awareness/personal improvement as a player, but you won't get better on the team aspects of the game until you join an actual team."
truetf2,3cy6cx,magnue,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Try not to die/be as aggressive. You need to try to stay alive for important things like knocking back the uber and pretty much constantly checking your medic's back.  Sometimes you don't need to be so passive, but if your team is asking that question then you probably should."
truetf2,3cy6cx,The_Burger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Even with mumble, lobby level communication is poor. Not always because it is absent, but because calls hold little quality information (Medic took...... ja but what and where?) and people rarely react accordingly and keep going by their business until it's too late (Scout gets called river/under, no one still alive stays on last.... moments later, backcap: Hurr durr, why no one called Scoot?).  Ideally, you should minimise the damage you take, know the various map locations, spam angles and sniper lines, and by extension get familiarised with the standard push tactics so as to be able to make educated guesses as to where the pack of your team is likely to be (as well as the opponents' one). But for that to be easier, you should look for people organising in-house pickups.  When I Pyro in lobbies, I just ""yoloswag"" around between front and flanks to better spot threats and to rely more on my game-sense and less on calls, before choosing to either run back to strengthen the combo or help my Soldier counter early threats. This is a lobby-only tactic, but it's unsurprisingly easy to get away with it most of the time because the other team is likely to suffer the same disorganisation problems as yours and you won't be punished. But with decent players, it is a very, very, very, very, very inefficient way to play Pyro."
truetf2,3cy6cx,xeroloplan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Only played a few dozen lobbies and a season of iron HL, so take all this with a grain of salt.  For me it was making the conceptual jump from whatever it was I was doing before (and whatever you're probably doing now) to being a ""glue"" class. It's not support, offense, or defense, it's a bit of everything. You have some specific things that you should focus on accomplishing (like spy checking) but your main objective is to patch the little holes that prevent the combo, and the team, from performing effectively. It's hard to quantify or enumerate all of the things that fall under this, and best described as ""a bunch of little things"" that, if done correctly, no one will even notice. The important part of all of this is staying alive in nearly all circumstances - generally I'd only sacrifice to give the combo a chance to escape when at uber disadvantage, or occasionally end up falling on a reflected roller to save the combo. The other 99% of the time you're most valuable alive, and that often means not getting kills, assists, or even much damage.  If your HL team has halfway-competent players in all of the 6s classes, you're probably going to be near the bottom of the scoreboard, and that's okay. Good pyro play will lift the entire team up without directly receiving any credit. This is a conceptual hurdle that I've seen a lot of pyros (myself included) struggle to get over, since nearly everything the pyro does to help the team doesn't show up on any scoreboard, stats page, or highlight reel."

truetf2,3cy6cx,mrsnakers,19,Sat Jul 11 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"How is this a constructive answer?  I'll say that playing mumble required lobbies doesn't guarantee good communication, in fact, often that's some of the worst communication you can have - most people either don't comm or just troll the mics until someone tells them to shut up.  OP, you need to play some pugs / scrims with a combo you can familiarize yourself with. You need to learn callouts / locations so that you can quickly find out where your combo is by simply asking. It's not shameful to occasionally not be sure of where you're team is pushing, but if you are constantly losing your combo chances are you're probably dying a bit more than you should be an may be playing too aggressively, since you shouldn't be constantly respawning and wondering where they went. The answer here is to play more with a combo you can communicate with to learn their routes and it will start to become more intuitive. Value your low death ratio as a Pyro more than your assist / kill ratio. Simply being alive more often than most classes means your playing Pyro correctly. You need to be around to stall ubers, reflect rockets and bombers, and throw / deal with spies. You're not necessarily a killing machine in HL.  There's a lot of things about TF2 that are taken for granted in other games for keeping up with your teammates, there's no definite names of areas, no minimap, no ability to see / easily hear friendlies well through walls (well except now that they've changed spectator view) - so it's all about knowing the maps and knowing what your combo is likely to be doing in certain situations. Play a bunch of KOTHs since they're easier to memorize and the flow is more predictable."

A few days after the mentioned proposal, I was informed that there was an announcement on the etf2l forums regarding DL stating that the sponsorship was dropped.   Well, no shit....   After reading it myself I was shocked: so instead of talking to me first, they preferred to just publicly announce things.   You're so full of yourself that you can't even see why they would drop any connection with you after a corrupt, underhanded political deal like that?

No admittance that he's a fucking asshole, which is step one for getting better. Trust me, if anyone would know, it's me. It's not enough to say ""I fucked up here or there."" You have to start with the realization that there's a reason that literally nobody likes you. This guy has fundamental personality flaws and hasn't yet recognized them. No improvement should be expected. It's insanely hard to change yourself even when you want to. It takes years and years and years of constant effort just to make a dent in your flaws. He's not gonna do it by accident, and no damage control apology is going to change that.  And advanced lobbies are still unacceptable.   There are also rumors going around that Advanced Lobbies are just a way of filling our pockets.    The fucking arrogance from this sentence and the ones after are quite annoying. Calling criticism of this cash grab a ""rumour"" is absurd. That's not what the word rumour means. We looked at the data publically available and came to a reasonable conclusion. And no, a free period doesn't make you generous when you're just building hype for your cash grab. Neither does extending that free period. Advanced lobbies are awful for competitive TF2 for reasons I've stated several times. Making them temporarily free does nothing to change that.   I must warn you that a project like TF2C has several thousand lines of code and most software engineers can tell you that things do not go from scratch to being perfect, certainly not TF2C. Of course anybody is a better coder than MasterNoob, so don’t let that hold you back. Just be aware that coding is just a small part of all the ingredients needed for something to work.  So don’t be naive and think that you can get something within months.  Another thing is when you want to deal with hundreds of concurrent users, you’re going to need some serious hardware. Not some $10 VPS, but some serious stuff which is going to cost money. Get some rich people or find a way to pay for them; I can already tell you, don’t expect too much donations from Europeans. It’s actually the Americans that keep us running ;-)   What the fuck is he even saying here? This entire thing is incredibly passive aggressive. That's his response to people not wanting anything to do with him, his attitude, or his creation?   So yeah, I am stubborn, and very proud of my achievements.    This is not an apology. This is not sincere.   You wouldn’t believe the hours I have spent on this project; I actually don’t keep track, but count me in for 25 hours per week on average is not a bad estimate.    This has fuck all to do with you being an asshole.   I can tell you when it hurts that some people just say bad things about the thing you worked on so hard.   This is not an apology. This is not sincere. This is passive aggression and victim playing. This is trying to make people feel guilty for not liking you. They dislike you for legitimate reasons.   When things like this actually happen, I really have trouble to control my emotions. Especially when I find out that most people are too lazy to even read a TL;DR.   This is definitely not an apology, and this is definitely not sincere. It's not okay to respond to being an asshole by saying ""I'm sorry you people all make me so mad.""  On the off-chance MasterNoob reads this: fuck off."

I guess you just decided to ignore the parts where he did actually write sentences of apology, apologizing to the staff and whatnot (which is what mattered to the case at hand, you know), you just decided to cherry pick the less-positive sentences and diss MasterNoob from there. ""Blah blah this isn't sincere"", ""Blah blah this isn't an apology"", come on, seriously? Technically you could be a really good liar and mask your true feelings behind a perfectly written politically correct publicaly appealing message. This actually came out different from that. I also want to see what sort of ""data"" you have that proves AL is a cash grab. He somehow predicted Gun Mettle? Hell, did Gun Mettle even come with Matchmaking (sure, you can find proof of matchmaking elements included in the code, but it's certainly not actually implemented)? How is he building ""hype"" for a cash grab? He gave out the service free of charge for three fucking months, for Christ's sake. That's time for people to test AL and if they like it they can choose to pay when the time comes, if they don't they move on. Giving out a trial period is certainly the right thing to do.

MN deserves a response when he makes a request.   by objectively describing the events so far?   By not trying to figure things out privately first. I haven't seen anyone from DL saying that they privately discussed their concerns with MN's request prior to making the public announcement that said things. Let's look at DL's original statement about this:   It is my pleasure to announce that DeutschLAN is dropping tf2center.com from sponsorship of the lan. We came to this conclusion because of three main reasons:   A prizepool of 2000€ was promised which was suddendly dropped to 500€ Masternoob made the condition that we ban former tf2center admin RTC from the Lan Bad business ethics/attitude from tf2center   Also I can proudly announce that from now on forward tf2pickup.net will be sponsoring the lan. A big thank you goes to them for supporting this community event. They have proven in previous season to be great and serious sponsors.   It may be an accurate description of the facts, however every single part of that post is framed in an incredibly inflamatory way. Intentionally or unintentionally, that post is pure mob bait.  Now it's possible DL did reach out to MasterNoob prior to making this public post and MasterNoob is lying. But if we assume both sides are telling the truth to the best of their knowledge, DL never should have posted that without talking it over with MN.   Everything is someone else's doing. How about if MN is responsible for his own actions?   MasterNoob did admit fault for taking the wrong steps. He admitted fault and apologized for not having listened to his admins. What more do you want him to apologize for? DL not responding to a message he sent? DL making a public spectacle of the situation? Him not wanting to put his name behind an apology letter he didn't believe was accurate?  Maybe he's lying about everything in his post. Maybe he's trying to manipulate people by spinning tales about what really happened. I don't know, I've only been able to make a judgement off of my own experiences talking with him and reading all of the public statements made.  Sure, he's probably a bit of a pretentious dick sometimes, but is that really enough to crucify him like people have been over this situation?  Edit: Welp sorry, I started to ramble a bit :/"

CuriositySphere would have also been a nice candidate but isn't here anymore fortunately. Always calling out on others while never looking at themselves in the mirror.  The only ones who should ever receive an apology are the individuals who have been truly wronged and that's it (aka definitely not people like you). The others are bystanders, who are either the spectators of this farce, or are the dogs who bark while the caravan goes on.  It takes no guts to be in the flock of sheep and to hit those who have back against the wall. Real strength of character comes from refusing simplistic/manichean thinking and instead to genuinely try to understand a situation in all its complexity while maintaining a relative detachment. To me, this statement is another important piece of the puzzle, and one that had been missing. In the real world you never have heroes and villains. You have people with beliefs and vested interests, who may cooperate or come into conflict because of them.     It’s safe to say that I should not be handling aspects that I'm not so good at, so I guess I see that now.  This belief does usually not happen overnight, but PR shit storms definitely help. I will tell you that TF2C staff has had some suggestions on how to improve our internal structure. This thing has only speed that up. I agree with a lot of you by focusing on the things I’m actually good at; coding is the most important role I have, but I’m pretty much involved in everything else, so I have to pick some roles and hire people to worry about the rest. I will tell you now that I have no idea how we’re going to do all that, but as we’ve shown in the past, TF2C proves to deal with difficult situations, I’m sure we can improve ourselves and show you guys we’re serious about this project.   To me, therein lies the acceptance that some things need to change, and it was sufficient. I stand with Terry on this one. Not defending MN (whose hot temper and stubbornness I dislike) but belying the trolls who are simply jumping on the mindless hate bandwagon because they know nothing better.  I'll let you meditate on this quote:   If human nature were not base, but thoroughly honourable, we should in every debate have no other aim than the discovery of truth; we should not in the least care whether the truth proved to be in favour of the opinion which we had begun by expressing, or of the opinion of our adversary. That we should regard as a matter of no moment, or, at any rate, of very secondary consequence; but, as things are, it is the main concern. Our innate vanity, which is particularly sensitive in reference to our intellectual powers, will not suffer us to allow that our first position was wrong and our adversary’s right. The way out of this difficulty would be simply to take the trouble always to form a correct judgment. For this a man would have to think before he spoke. But, with most men, innate vanity is accompanied by loquacity and innate dishonesty. They speak before they think; and even though they may afterwards perceive that they are wrong, and that what they assert is false, they want it to seem thecontrary. The interest in truth, which may be presumed to have been their only motive when they stated the proposition alleged to be true, now gives way to the interests of vanity: and so, for the sake of vanity, what is true must seem false, and what is false must seem true."

truetf2,3cvbuc,memccann-,17,Sat Jul 11 09:55:24 2015 UTC,Feels genuine. I might be gullible but he seems to have the best intentions in mind and he certainly has worked more than most community members in building the scene.  I don't agree with his decisions regarding the whole banning with sponsorship fiasco but I don't think they deserved nearly as much flak as they got. I hope the rest of the community shares this sentiment.
truetf2,3cvbuc,neobowman,31,Sat Jul 11 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know... overall I didn't really feel like he said anything. He just sort of rambled on about different things. Yeah, he gave some interesting perspective, like how he believed (or says he did) that the $2000 changed to $500 months ago, but there wasn't really a whole lot of substance.  He spent quite a while talking about how hard he works on TF2C (and I'm sure he does), and about how difficult/ expensive it is to run (again, I'm sure it is), but overall the section about people starting alternate websites had a strong feel of him saying ""good fucking luck.""  Overall my opinion of MN is that he's a really smart guy. I'm not a programmer, but it seems like he's really good at that aspect of things. He clearly, however, has very little skill in dealing with people. I obviously can't speak about his internal behavior, but he has no idea how to interact with the public. This opinion is not just based on this incident. I've seen him interact with TF2 players on the TF2C website and in chat. He comes off as an arrogant asshole every time.  Edit: I didn't really mean to end my comment on such a negative note, I just sorta ran out of motivation to continue my train of thought. So, briefly:   I don't think anything terrible has really happened here. I think it largely comes down to MN's incompetence in speaking to the public. I think he made a horrible mistake in firing that PR admin. MN clearly doesn't have the ability to deal with PR, so he should have left that alone. There are other little things in this statement that really make me question how he is as a leader, but overall, that's not really my business to question."

truetf2,3cvbuc,NotTerryCrews,16,Sat Jul 11 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"People seem to think that I've been trying to defend MasterNoob. I'm not. He's done some things that I don't agree with, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't deserve a fair trial.  I don't care what happens to TF2Center or MasterNoob. He's only a person with coding ability who is bad at PR and makes bad decisions, and TF2C is only a website for lobbies.  The way I saw it, there were a few possible outcomes from the recent events:   Creation of competitors: Sparked by public outrage, concerned and informed players will take steps to improve the community, by either creating competitors to TF2C, thereby forcing TF2C to improve. TF2Center closes down with no viable replacements currently available: This is bad. Regardless of how it happens, the community would lose a very large number of its active userbase. Not just the newer players, but also the players who no longer have time to commit to a team, and stay involved with the community through lobbies. Witch hunt for MasterNoob/Mother Tereza: The worst possible outcome. A successful witch hunt will result in either TF2C closing down, or losing a valuable member of its team. An unsuccessful witch hunt doesn't accomplish anything other than making them dislike the community that has hounded them for months even more. Either result will undoubtedly sway the momentum of recent events into a route that is filled with no positive outcome. People will care more about a ridiculous witch hunt about someone who is insignificant to the community at large than actually using that momentum to create something positive from this mess.   The recent /r/tf2 post about the events was filled to the brim with inaccuracies, misinformation, and bias. Whoever wrote it clearly had a personal vendetta with MasterNoob (whether or not it was justified doesn't matter), and that angered me greatly. Perhaps it was due to my anger that I was unable to explain my position clearly, but, like I said before, it's not to defend MN, it's to focus on what's important - community improvement.  Needless to say, my first goal is to prevent this from turning away from positive efforts, which is why I disliked Kevin's video, and the /r/tf2 post greatly. They both mention doing/seeking positive alternatives, but only at the very end, in much shorter length, as if they were footnotes.  I told my side of the story not in an attempt to defend MN, but to provide more accurate information and let readers make their own choices.  Quite honestly, I've done the most wrong out of anyone regarding the PR statement, and, had I not resigned, I most certainly would have been dismissed from TF2C staff. Marty's decision to release the statement should be seen as mine, and mine alone. Nothing in this situation is black and white, and you absolutely have to read the full story before making a decision.  TF2Can emerged from Flares that Care because individuals channeled their outrage into doing something positive for the community; not wasting time trying to hunt down the corrupt individuals in charge of FTC. The competitive TF2 community has achieved incredible things time and again because there are people willing to do good for the sake of doing something positive. The recent events surrounding TF2Center can result in achieving great things - or it can be squandered by shortsighted individuals who care only for vengeance and humiliation. And you know what? Who MN is, what he has done, does not matter at all in the long run, as long as people seek to improve the community. If you make people care and focus more about some silly witch hunt than positive efforts, then you've done much worse, and made a much more negative impact on the community than he has.  I think the most important thing we can take away from MN's statement is this:   it’s safe to say that I should not be handling aspects that I'm not so good at, so I guess I see that now.  This belief does usually not happen overnight, but PR shit storms definitely help. I will tell you that TF2C staff has had some suggestions on how to improve our internal structure. This thing has only speed that up. I agree with a lot of you by focusing on the things I’m actually good at; coding is the most important role I have, but I’m pretty much involved in everything else, so I have to pick some roles and hire people to worry about the rest. I will tell you now that I have no idea how we’re going to do all that, but as we’ve shown in the past, TF2C proves to deal with difficult situations, I’m sure we can improve ourselves and show you guys we’re serious about this project.   Before I left, I wrote up a bunch of guidelines, developed through my experiences at UGC, and debate with Digresser, on how I thought internal infrastructure at TF2C could be improved, and how to implement it. Should they choose to adapt that, or come up with their own protocol, and everyone sticks by the code, then I can see TF2C rising from these recent events a much better site and organization.  TL;DR: Fuck you, read my post."

truetf2,3cujxe,MovkeyB,8,Fri Jul 10 22:41:20 2015 UTC,"I already tested this for myself when it released.  Using the default reticle for the minigun, stock tends to hit within the circle and the areas immediately bordering the outside of the circle, whereas the Tomislav will only hit directly within the circle.  Personally I do feel like my damage is better with the Tomislav at medium-long range, though I do also feel like people downplay how much a Tomislav can effect you at point blank. An example of what I mean is I remember someone posting ""Tomislav rewards good aim, if you kill scouts slower with it it's cause your aim is bad."" Well....no, not really. The minigun creates a larger area that the scout is expected to dodge while also firing faster. If you have two heavies with perfect accuracy try to down a scout at close range, the minigun Heavy will still get the kill faster.  One is stronger at close-range hands down, the other is more practical at longer ranges.  EDIT: Just for clarity, yes I realize the tone with the scout example might be more that the difference in damage is too small to matter, I merely meant that from a theoretical perspective, yes there is a difference, which is of course made clear by the Heavy vs. Heavy matchups."
truetf2,3cujxe,AFlyingNun,3,Sat Jul 11 05:05:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is, in close range you already have SO MUCH DAMAGE, that heavy can afford to lose some damage there and still be extremely lethal.   Your scout example is true. As is the heavy vs. heavy example. But the longer range from the tomislav increases your options by so much (something that heavy was severely lacking). And that is something to theorycraft."
truetf2,3cujxe,shiftup72,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:04:12 2015 UTC,"In a heavy V heavy scenario, who then would win at close/medium/far ranges with which miniguns?

truetf2,3cujxe,BluntTruthGentleman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:10:41 2015 UTC,"Recently tested with a mirror bot.  Close range and medium range, if they spin up at the same time, tomislav survives with about 40 health. If they are both spun up, minigun wins with about 100 health at medium range, and chews the tomislav up at close range.  Long range is irrelevant because heavies aren't snipers."
truetf2,3cujxe,Mao-C,2,Sun Jul 12 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"If spread is totally random then the accuracy boost should almost exactly offset the fire rate reduction in terms of dps. Thats for a player whose model is smaller than the cone of either though. Its kinda hard to measure something useful though because distance, class, orientation, and stance of the enemy all matter.  Not to mention ""potential dps"" is already kind of misleading. It does have the faster spin up and silent spooling as well though."

truetf2,3cujxe,wrackk,4,Mon Jul 13 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that Tomislav is extremely, devastatingly good against all ""thin"" classes which tend to slip between regular bullets. Now I'm not waiting until stray bullet hits that Scout or Sniper, the gun just works as expected dealing steady damage.  I'm not sure whether longer effective range is worth the damage trade off in most situations or not (probably not), but if I'm dealing with smaller hitboxes Tomislav is a clear winner."
truetf2,3cujxe,fatmoonkins,6,Fri Jul 10 23:06:46 2015 UTC,I think the Natascha is a better option instead of the Tomislav. I can't think of situations where the Tomislav would be useful (maybe holding lasts and you can hide in a weird spot such as outside of shutter on Gully? Before they call you out that is) but the damage reduction for the Natascha is amazing on heavy. You become even tankier than you were before and the damage penalty on the gun is irrelevant when you can tank damage longer.

truetf2,3cujxe,BluntTruthGentleman,2,Sat Jul 11 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"The increased effective range that the tomislav gives you pushes it from a situational good unlock to possibly the best overall. It lets you put out over 100 damage at a pretty decent range if you continually track them over a few seconds. It also has the silent rev-up, which is huge. It allows you to play heavy much more aggressively. All heavy needs is a second of close range shooting to get a kill, and the tomislav allows to you consistantly get the peak advantage on people. You can just sit in a corner revved up by a health pack and get a kill almost everytime. The reduced firing speed makes a difference in heavy vs heavy fights, but the wind up speed increase makes up for the lack of DPS in a fight vs any other class.  I do think the natascha is still viable on things like payload offense or maybe on some koth maps. The 25% resist is basically the same thing as having 375 health without overheal. Taking that down when he's just sitting on the cart is gonna be pretty difficult.  I really can't imagine using any secondary other than the sandvich though. The family business is really good now, but its just so hard to justify using a shotgun on heavy when the sandvich exists."

But otherwise, the Tomislav is very fun on maps were being sneaky pays off, or where you simply hang out at range and frequently rotate between positions."
truetf2,3cujxe,Maxillaws,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I throw it on and everything goes great until the other team runs a heavy using any other minigun against me. That seems to be one of its biggest drawbacks, you're completely screwed against another heavy. Apart from that it's a very, very good weapon.   I'm ecstatic that Valve finally poked at heavy in general, there's actually more to think about than: ""Are you firing bullets? Good job, way to go champ."""
truetf2,3cujxe,Karl_sagan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"So far for me the Tomislav has been very good for Heavy vs. Heavy encounters. Your capable of staying out of the effective range of a Stock Heavy while putting out consistent damage and reacting faster.  In comp this won't be very relevant most of the time, but it's a good thing to consider when choosing it over Sasha."
truetf2,3cujxe,Karl_sagan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:48 2015 UTC,I would like to say the silentrev up has gotten me by surprise. I haven't died because he was in a. Sneaky spot but have taken a good amount of damage because of it
truetf2,3cv1c2,kyber30,23,Sat Jul 11 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"Note that I main medic but I would say that it is definitely viable. It might be an upgrade to spies who mostly use the knife as it allows you to get chainstabs a little bit more consistently. I would say having less health definitely affects on your dm ability so I would think this doesn't go too well with revolver at least. Amby seems decent if you use it from afar, l'etranger seems to me that it'd be the best with it since allows you to take the longer but safer route to where you want to go and you don't really wanna get into too many fights with your gun either, only for cleanup kills which the 30-45dmg should be enough.  Edit: Even in high plat you can still get chainstabbed, it does happen less often but during our scrims in ashville it defintely happened several times thanks to the big earner."
truetf2,3cv1c2,metawe,6,Sat Jul 11 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"Considering Acooma is regarded as the best spy in plat, using him to justify a weapon's viability doesn't make much sense. He's going to destroy using any of the spy's weapons because he is just that good."
truetf2,3cv1c2,guyVI,15,Sat Jul 11 12:48:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. That guy would wreck using an empty paper towel roll.
truetf2,3cv1c2,CQH,8,Sat Jul 11 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, the big problem with the big earner was that it provided a mediocre advantage on kill for a mediocre negative before the kill. As a spy, any negatives before the kill want to be avoided because spy is a pick class and naturally won't be going for a bunch of frags. Just very specific ones. You don't want to lessen your chance of getting that med stab for a better chance of getting away after.  The question after the buff is if the now relatively significant upside is worth the mediocre downside. I think right now, its viable but not amazing. A viable sidegrade, which is what's ideal. I think with the current big earner will be good for going for flank picks and getting away to cause mayhem. For big combo picks though, I'd stick with the stock."
truetf2,3cv1c2,neobowman,5,Sat Jul 11 02:06:04 2015 UTC,Another thing to keep in mind is that the health penalty now matters less beause the new 20% damage resistance while cloaked means you fall under fewer damage thresholds than before.
truetf2,3cv1c2,Sabesaroo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:05:16 2015 UTC,This also applies to the kunai now as well. Having over 200 health plus 20% damage resistance means there's a damn good chance a spy who makes a pick will escape unless you have your team focus fire on him.
truetf2,3cv1c2,Vanuez,-10,Sat Jul 11 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Only for pubs. For comp it continues to be useless because you still get oneshot.   That video proves nothing. Only officials matter, not practice matches. You can get away with a lot during them."
truetf2,3cv1c2,MovkeyB,5,Sat Jul 11 00:57:51 2015 UTC,You won't get one shot while cloaked anymore unless the attack would already one shot a 125 HP class because of the 20% damage reduction. That makes the HP penalty much more bearable.
truetf2,3cv1c2,phoenixrawr,2,Sat Jul 11 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"It does, but getting one shot while cloaked isnt really the issue.  If you eat half that damage while cloaked your going to flicker and then get killed anyway unless youre in a good position to back off.  The more important aspect is not getting killed in the short window before you stab someone."
truetf2,3cv1c2,Mao-C,4,Sat Jul 11 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"uhhhh did you watch the match on Asheville?  the difference is that the big earner is good now because if I get hit with a 100 dmg rocket I would die anyways even if I had 125 hp. with the nerf to the dead ringer it means spy's can be shut down more easily if you can simply find them. losing 25 hp can be irrelevant especially with the upside of quick chainstabs, and the ability to get away not only with extra cloak but a boost as well."

truetf2,3cv1c2,MovkeyB,10,Sat Jul 11 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"You're talking about one of the best spies (probably the best in NA) playing against one of the best teams in NA at the moment.  He knows how to play spy, when to attack, when to go for backstabs, when to use gun, who to go for.  It's not a matter as looking out for him and calling him out because he knows when to attack when you are distracted"
truetf2,3cv1c2,Maxillaws,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"Considering what team he played against, they made callouts each time they died. But Acooma is one of the best right now so he probably knows what to do to counter that. A team cannot always focus on a spy as so much is going on around."
truetf2,3cs5e3,thezander8,12,Fri Jul 10 09:41:32 2015 UTC,"The overdose is more built for escaping rather than fighting. If you want to protect yourself more, either use the stock or blutsauger.  As for QF jumping, its really difficult to do if you don't coordinate with your pocket. Your pocket has to be able to jump in a way such that you are able to follow him otherwise, you would just get flinged into the air and take unnecessary fall dmg. You would have to be close to your pocket because the game doesn't compensate for the difference between you and your pocket. However, even if the soldier/demo knows how to jump with QF, you would need to know how to air strafe slightly at the very least."
truetf2,3cs5e3,DragonSlapz,5,Fri Jul 10 10:51:01 2015 UTC,"All right, that makes sense. I can see how coordination would make this a lot easier; a lot of my pockets seem to have little awareness of my ability to actually follow them, based on distance, obstacles, etc."

If Valve is absolutely not willing to make it go to zero like every single other meter on every single other weapon (banners, phlog, soda popper, etc, nothing else keeps its charge), there still should be some sort of serious penalty. I would go so far as to say that losing 50% of whatever you had built is fair, but I would push for even more. Dropping an uber is a major fuckup, and as a result it deserves a major penalty."

truetf2,3cs5e3,MovkeyB,6,Fri Jul 10 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"The Crossbow is much stronger, it reloads faster and has passive reload like Flare Gun.  Pretty much every high level Medic runs it (except Harbleu, who still runs Overdose).  Overdose isn't bad, it's still quite strong, but you gain a bit of self-defense and sacrifice a lot of potential long ranged healing.  If you want to fight with the Overdose, the key is to walk backwards and lead them into your stream of needles with your movement.  Regarding QF: jump maps will help with airstrafing.  It helps to have your pocket soldier call when he's jumping so you can prepare to airstrafe.  If you're playing in pubs, perhaps ask your pocket to call ""MEDIC"" a second before he jumps or something."
truetf2,3cs5e3,liuwqf,3,Fri Jul 10 20:21:45 2015 UTC,Definitely learn to move around with QF rocket jumps. It's called air control or air strafing and you can do it with enemy projectiles to effect some pretty crazy escapes.

This video might help shed some light.  as for which format you should play, some people will tell you to play highlander first because its easier than 6s.  personally, 6s feels like it puts more impact on individual skill, more fun, easier to coordinate in and much faster than highlander, but ultimately, this is all preference.  play both formats and play whichever is more fun for you.  you can play 6s at TF2Center, and NA 6v6 Newbie Mixes and Newbie PUGs.

truetf2,3cqtoq,liuwqf,2,Sun Jul 12 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"he plays almost always in the combo, he's insanely heal heavy"
truetf2,3cqtoq,Ordoo,3,Sun Jul 12 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"Medic can do it, typically it's the pocket though. Soldier in 6s / Demo in HL is the most common. The Pocket has better sightlines than the medic as he is always the one walking around a corner first or peeking a choke, etc. The medic cant risk peeking to assess the situation first hand as he might get sniped/jumped/etc so its best to leave the decisions on what fights to take to somebody who can look for themselves."
truetf2,3cqtoq,Dizmn,3,Fri Jul 10 11:17:20 2015 UTC,"It's not really mandatory but it's much better. As park said a pocket maincaller is neat but maincalling as medic can be so fucking good for your team if you know what you're doing, if you just get in 6s though you won't know how to maincall, you might think you will able to issue callouts but you need to keep so many things in mind, like uber advantage/disadvantage, where the enemy combo is, how long you're gonna take to build, exchanging frags and if you get forced seeking out their med and doing a force too.  If you play in a team you should really maincall. It's not necessary, but maincalling medics are a GODSEND. Look at KnOxXx... best fucking maincaller, I admire him, he's so good and carried his team time and again. Keep in mind medic has so many info... Don't be the only one talking, maincalling requires the cooperation of your teammates in order to get positions, flanks, go through chokes and organize pushes.  Yeah a pocket maincaller is good but maincalling as medic will do nothing, nothing but 100% improve your skill and gamesense. Definitely do it."
truetf2,3cqtoq,diath,3,Fri Jul 10 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"Since you said you prefer the idea of 6's over highlander, I'll focus on that.  In my experience, Pocket does better at main calling because he can see the enemy team. That said however, your job as medic (or at least something you should get used to) is to counter call. Your counter calls should be based on either your uber advantage (whether you have one) and heals.  If you want me to go more in depth, you're free to add me on steam, my reddit name is the same as my steam name."
truetf2,3cqtoq,Nazek42,2,Fri Jul 10 21:22:08 2015 UTC,"Med has 150 health. Pocket has 300. Who can peek better?  When we had our med maincalling he died a lot in really stupid ways. Now that we've relieved him of maincalling duties, he... well, he still finds other stupid ways to die. My point is, if you're gonna maincall as med, make sure your team's comms are top-notch because you can't afford to take a look for yourself."
truetf2,3cq0xv,RK0019K,19,Thu Jul 9 21:16:59 2015 UTC,I slept through my match because I work nights and had the night off so I actually slept for more than 5 hours and it was worth it.

The only advice I can give is to make sure everyone is committed to actually trying before you start the season and drop out early if they change their mind.  I'd never played 6v6 before this season, I was hoping to learn from a more experienced team, I ended up running it and trying to maincall and everything when I have no clue what is going on."
truetf2,3cq0xv,Great_American,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:50:48 2015 UTC,alright yeah our teams main problem is about half of us actually practice regularly and the others usually just show up for games. I intend for my next team to be doing at least 2 practices a week 1 being strat talks and the other being a pug/scrim as well as having a discussion of what went right and what went wrong after every game.

truetf2,3cq0xv,liuwqf,3,Fri Jul 10 10:13:53 2015 UTC,I didn't think anyone was in the same boat as me but you are describing my season about 2 years ago I think. I've since focused on running some pub servers but I also have my shitter team (they know it and they still love me) enter in only silly things like the arena respawn tournaments or the ones where you only fight with the pan.

Especially in a smaller league like UGC EU you may end up playing some unbalanced matches. It shouldn't matter as long as you have fun scrimming and improve you should be able to put bad officials aside and play a better match next time.

Well you gotta tell them to stick with you and learn how to rollout, because it's not something you can keep on doing for long else you will always get rolled.

truetf2,3crbwf,Fizzyfloat,18,Fri Jul 10 03:43:56 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, your anger in MGE is not actually at the other person, but you displacing the anger that you have at yourself.   Once you realize this, that'll help a lot. Then instead of getting mad  at the other person for being better, when you would think to say something rude in your head or aloud. Say something nice. e.g. ""He got so lucky."" say ""This guy has really good movement.""   Also I don't think think asking someone what div they're in really matters. If you play consistently on a server, people will have ELO's. Plus DM servers don't always bring out the best people. One thing that I have found success with, ask people what I could do better. People who are rude, might be nice enough to be honest with you rather than give you a joke answer.  If they do give you a joke answer, let it roll off. There will always be idiots in the world, you cannot control that. You can control how you react to them. In competitive anything, the more you can handle your own emotions the more you control your own game.  MGE is a good place to start to practice that skill set itself. Last, something that I found help me. If someone was beating me really well, I would just try to mimic what they were doing. Clearly if it works for them, it must work. You'd be surprised at how effective that can be, plus you might learn a new playstyle in the process."

There's no patented best strategy anymore, there's a little room to explore. So I think the best advice is general gameplay advice, nothing specific.  The most important thing to do as engineer is to not-die. Engineer has the lowest damage potential in the game, but they simultaneously have the best punish with sentry guns. Catching people out who are over-extending can be momentum changing. People constantly underestimate engi, because it's fairly easy to minimize his contribution in a standard, frontline, team vs team fight. When you're team starts to break, it's your job to make sure they just bend."

truetf2,3cp4r4,SheaTheEngie,6,Fri Jul 10 14:38:56 2015 UTC,3-0 rolls on viaduct7 imply that the enemy team easily overextended and you got to punish a lot.  1 log does not mean anything; that's disingenuous. I could find 30 logs where both engis do the least amount of damage.  Good for you though.
truetf2,3cp4r4,WaffleSandwhiches,-4,Fri Jul 10 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"Actually it was more like I overextended and they failed to punish me. Anyways, I was joking and not really meaning to prove a point- I was also tired of people saying engineers can't frag. Imo what makes a good engineer is subjective. The engineer I play for my team is very specific varying by the map. On maps like ashville I need to have flank presence, on upward I prioritize protecting my combo over denying the objective with my guns, on gullywash I run full time level threes. It really depends on your team. You along with the spy are the wildcard classes- just do what needs to be done to win, and sometimes that does mean giving up your life for a pick. Or playing passive and staying alive. Once again it depends on what your team needs and when. /ramble"

truetf2,3cp4r4,Gnarlyspicoli,11,Fri Jul 10 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Always remember that you are a support class first. Always.  Engie has two jobs: objective, and team support.  Objective varies with map/gametype and red/blu team. In general, on stopwatch RED you deny the objective (or areas leading to the objective) with a powerful lvl 3 sentry. You force the enemy to devote flankers to killing you or to spend an uber taking out your gun, and you punish people for trying to get free time on the objective. Your main job is usually to keep a gun alive and keep the objective clear.  On stopwatch blu, you're usually the one on the objective. It's kind of boring a lot, but frankly you're the least useful and most expendable member of the team on blu, so you get relegated to pushing the kart a lot.  Support is just what it sounds like: you support the team with poweful utility buildings. Dispensers give your combo staying power by being a constant source of ammo and health they can retreat to. Teleporters reduce punishment for deaths by allowing your team to get to the front more quickly. If you aren't playing an objective, these buildings should be your focus most of the time.  Engie also has a third function, which is much less generally viable. It requires very strong DM skills, timing, gamesense and luck, but (pre minisentry nerf, probably less viable now) shotgun + minis engie is a very powerful flank defender and damage dealer in the right circumstances. The key is managing your aggression; nearly every other class will instantly destroy you if they actually pay attention to you, so making sure not to overcommit when the enemy is focused on you is very important.  So yeah. On red stopwatch, keep a gun on the objective and support buildings up. On blu stopwatch, glue your ass to the objective and build support buildings when you die. Other modes, guard the flank and maintain support buildings."
truetf2,3cp4r4,kierkkadon,18,Thu Jul 9 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"Most important thing kinda varies per map and gamemode. Take payload, for example. On defense, the engineer's role is obvious - defend. His role requires him to keep people on the front lines (teleporter) as well as have a sentry up to counter pushes. On offense, his role once again is to keep people moving and to push the cart. DM is not a priority, but can be accomplished with new more mobile level 3s. I play this way.     On koth, maintaining a good dispenser is important. Shares the healing role with the med and enables your players to stay up longer. Teles are less of importance, because koth maps are smaller. I run a defensive mini behind the point on our side to deter flank classes or on point level 3s.       On 5cp, I hate playing engineer. You're much more mobile which isn't good because spawns are always changing. Teleporters are difficult to maintain. The maps are huge. Normally I run DM engineer or attempt to sneak around and set up a level 3 behind the enemy team. I don't really know what the meta is for 5cp for engineer, to be honest. I assume it is to play conservatively and do a combination of the koth/payload strat."
truetf2,3cp4r4,hockeychick44,8,Thu Jul 9 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure, but dispensers to help heal and minis to protect flank would make the most sense to me for 5cp."

His team pushed into last and got wiped, so the other team tried to push out onto second, but the engi had a wrangled lvl 3 pointing at the main exit, and shut down the push so hard that his team had time to regroup and save second. It's just one situation, but I hope it helps."

truetf2,3cp4r4,0Valkyrie0,5,Fri Jul 10 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of highlander engineer boils down to this: play defensively and support your team.  (Which is to say, your role is support and your strength lies in defensive play.)  You lack the tools to do anything else, so your best bet is to help your teammates do their jobs by reducing pressures and concerns.  You're pretty versatile in how you can accomplish this, and this coupled with your low value as a pick means you can go wherever you're needed.  Your freedom is mainly restricted by what the other team will let you get away with, not by what your team absolutely needs you to do.  Contrary to popular belief, you aren't role-locked or loadout-locked on certain map types, and any way in which this was previously true was probably altered by the Gun Mettle update.  But the defensive/support role of engineer is something no update will ever change (barring a really stupid buff like literally getting a sticky launcher) so it's a pretty good principle to lean on.  Learning how to work with teammates is more important to competitive than memorizing a particular role anyway.  Suggestions for play include: always fight when your team is fighting, but hang back a little bit and avoid being right in the front lines; consider spychecking to be even more your priority than your pyro's; be near teammates as much as possible (inversely: don't let teammates be alone if possible); only go for picks when they're handed to you (you'll learn with experience what you can and can't get); learn how to play with your limitations; practice dm; and don't be afraid to be creative and try new build spots and new things (but let your team know first if they're relying on you to do something else).  Also learn other classes so you can get off engineer when you get frustrated with it."
truetf2,3cp4r4,Pengn,3,Fri Jul 10 10:44:02 2015 UTC,"you aren't role locked or loadout locked      This is a great and very important point. Sometimes in lobbies I get questioned why I'm not running minis on offense, especially on payload maps. I promise, I know what I'm doing, the things that I do that matter to the team (dispenser and tele) will still be there, just chill. We've won a lot of games because of unconventional sentry placements. Stirring up the meta can be very rewarding for an engineer in non critical sentry situations like offensive payload or offensive attack-defend."
truetf2,3cp4r4,hockeychick44,3,Fri Jul 10 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"Well.  When I said that I had specifically in mind minis on defense pre-update, which was becoming a thing in platinum on pretty much everything but the most broken points (upward last, badwater 3rd).  Maybe post-nerf minis aren't as strictly dominant on offense, but +25 hp is still really important, and so is build time, and so is 100 metal cost.  The thing to understand when using level 3s in the situations where minis would classically be used is (as it always has been) that you can't play in a dedicated ""I am the sentry engie, I will do nothing but build my sentry and expect my team to protect me"" mindset like you maybe would on defense, because you can't have people on your team sitting around doing nothing but supporting you, and you need to be able to be part of fights and do things when you don't have the gun actually up.  This is where the real buff to offensive level 3s comes in - you aren't penalized for switching off/onto them anymore, so you don't get locked into a situation where you can't switch wrenches for the sake of your teleporter anymore, and that frees you up a lot more for experimentation."
truetf2,3cp4r4,Pengn,3,Fri Jul 10 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"Your life. Everything else can go down. Don't put yourself in a situation to keep it up if you will die doing it. Guns can be rebuilt, especially after the most recent update, so long as your team can support you. If you die, your team no longer has support and on payload that means they basically have to hold long enough for you to get back up, or concede two holds to give you the ability to build on the next one."

Your guns and wrangler can stall an opposing push or set up an attack. You bring a 10th player to the team who has an aimbot and 0 gamesense. Treat it well and it can be the deciding factor in a fight.   Your dispenser can shore up a hold and provide a launching pad for an attack. Build it where your team needs a rallying point, and near the players who have to hold space far away from kits.    Your teleporters can save valuable time for your team, and disrupt the pacing of the map. Build them where the team needs to hold and get instant boots on the ground.     Know what building is important when, and trade your time for your team's well being. Know when you can get away with a shotgun duel, and know where your team needs an extra player.

truetf2,3cnbjl,KevinIsPwn,18,Thu Jul 9 06:10:44 2015 UTC,"Fantastic summary, and I'm really glad you included that screencap of Marty.   Boycotting and transfering to tf2pug.me, tf2pickup.net is gonna be difficult. Like you said, there really isn't a direct replacement to TF2C, so it will be difficult to use anything other than it. We sort of have to change TF2C from the inside out, or else we risk watching it burn to the ground.  I personally think MN's massive immaturity and lack of competence makes him a danger even to TF2C's technical side, and he really shouldn't have any place in TF2C, but I'm comfortable with just your suggestion as well. Let's share this video and push for change, that's the most important part. I'm quoting someone else but 'there has to be better administrators out of a community of thousands.'"
truetf2,3cnbjl,aoid,10,Thu Jul 9 08:46:49 2015 UTC,"MN owns TF2C, so unless he voluntarily resigns and lets someone else take control, which would be a dream come true. Considering his attitude, that isn't going to happen, ever."
truetf2,3cnbjl,achnie,36,Thu Jul 9 09:22:43 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this at all. You've summarized only the issues that incite the public to anger.  I'll explain with my own insight.   TF2Center promises to use the donated money to fund server costs and community events. I have no reason to believe that MN's intentions are anything but this. The primary reasoning behind the drop in funding is due to change in donations per month. I won't disclose financial information to the public, but the donations in January (when MN pledged the 2k euros) and February are so dramatically different that the drop in DeutschLAN funding is perfectly reasonable. This information was miscommunicated between the parties, which is a reason behind the current issues. What RTC did before he resigned was completely irresponsible, and if he had not resigned, he most definitely would have been let go, and banned from TF2C. There was no debate amongst staff that his actions were unacceptable for any sort of administrator. While MN's offer to ban him from DeutschLAN is also wrong, I believe it is unfair to withhold the underlying information regarding the conflict between RTC and TF2C. Take a look at the majority of people who complain about TF2C bans. They think that they're edgy martyrs, and goad the admittedly easily exasperated staff into making statements bad for PR. Take the recent bans for name violations: Niggatron and TF2C | Ancer.  What would it mean if we allowed clearly inappropriate names on TF2Center? Any sort of racial slur should be unacceptable, and to allow them would be a disaster in the making. You are signed out of the site if you try to log in with the ""TF2C |"" tag in your name when you're not an admin/moderator, so the individual that decided to use the name went to extreme lengths to troll TF2C and goad a response. Again, not exactly someone who showcases responsibility on their part. Taking this vocal minority into account, now look at the primary admins that are being targeted: MasterNoob and Mother Tereza. While MN can be childish and irresponsible, he is also a very intelligent and talented individual - I have enjoyed every discussion I have had with him. We may differ in opinion on many things, some of which are what I and many others believe to be clearly erroneous beliefs, but that does not make him a Disney villain. The world is not black and white. Mother Tereza has had a history of controversial statements, almost all of which stem from the fact that English is not his first language. The man is also incredibly intelligent, but rather constricted by his verbiage. He has had no prior experience dealing with large public affairs like TF2Center, and it clearly shows in his interactions with the troll minority that badger him for public statements. He is a reasonable man, and I am hard pressed to find many faults with him. The leaking of that image is a direct result of my actions in the past two days, and I have no doubt that my actions were anything but fair, or acceptable. I do not doubt that people may see my actions are for the greater good of the community, but I did them through perverse methods. One thing that people do not know is that we conversed with each other extremely informally in the Moderator forums - to the point that it was more like a small, close-knit community than a professional setting.  The PR statement, as Digresser pointed out, is a creation of hers, with my own and NinjaMoocow's input added in. We, the moderators, had agreed to publish a final, released statement which we would first all agree to, and sign off on. However, we could not come to a consensus on what to release. Given that we pushed the release date back several times, I took into my own hands the matter and pushed for Marty to publish a version that cut out the sections with the most debate, yet still maintain the same general tone as the original statement Digresser authored. This does not excuse the fact that I went behind every other admin's back and published the statement prematurely. MasterNoob is completely justified in his anger at the PR statement being published. In order to further my own agenda - to better the competitive TF2 community - which in this case meant attempting to improve the reputation of TF2Center, I have trampled on many peoples' feelings and reputations. Whether the ends justify the means, I'll leave that up to you to decide.   I am extremely appreciative that you took the time to try and explain the situation in a shortened video. But the situation at hand should most definitely not be shortened, and interested readers most definitely should not come to a conclusion without understanding the full story. TF2Center has a huge position in the current TF2 community, and losing it would be a massive detriment, regardless of administrative actions. It is useful, but also flawed - I see the possibility for improvement for everyone if there were competitors to TF2C. The point of Digresser and I's post is to incite others to better the community, not to witch hunt unpleasant characters. While your video does not intend to do that, I predict that people will be misinformed based on the statements you've made. As /u/hockeychick44 stated in the other thread, ""being informed is the best thing one can do at this point."""

Luckily there hasn't been much poo flinging, but it's beginning to devolve to that.    To clear some things up: Masternoob and Tereza have fucked up. Marty fucked up by posting a drafted apology before Masternoob gave him the go ahead. Like Terry said, he fucked up by pushing Marty. Its all just a bunch of compounded mistakes! The thread has been hidden, not deleted. The admins announced to the members (Heiarchy is admin-moderator-member-everyone else) that they will be issuing an announcement regarding the DeutchLAN debacle - this wasn't Marty going rogue or anything.     Now I'm sad because they have few, if any NA moderation and NA is (one of?) their biggest regions. This is going to affect the entire tf2c community now, and that's concerning. It's a wonderful platform that is being ruined by bad decisions.    Let's not have a witchhunt. Let it work itself out.

The Machina almost exclusively changes Sniper vs. Sniper battles. when a sniper is buffed, he will have 185 health. The fully charged Machina bodyshot does 173 damage compared to the sniper rifle's 150.  If the enemy sniper is using the Machina, the medic is forced to keep their own sniper buffed to over 173 consistently when they peek. This means buffing other players is going to be pretty limited or alternatively, the sniper is going to have to risk being bodyshot killed.

No, but I find that a pyro or demo (or soldier to an extent) is much more liabel to run around with 4 or five chip dmg and not pick up a med pack than they are to run around with 150 or less and not try to top off that health.

truetf2,3cp5g9,Kairu927,3,Fri Jul 10 20:11:32 2015 UTC,I was really just re-iterating what I heard SpaceGhostsCoffee saying. He's generally had a very hard-scopey style and its been hurting him in plat. You just get punished for it by some really good players.
truetf2,3cp5g9,Karl_sagan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:31 2015 UTC,Most top plat snipers hardscope a fair amount. Hardscopeing is usually better and the machina gives you free extra damage. Most top snipers are finally realizing the machina is and upgrade to the stock sniper in most situations.
truetf2,3cp5g9,Stevepander,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:16:10 2015 UTC,"Snipers are used to ""threaten"" sightlines on a lot of occasions. Hard-scoping is the best way to bank in on that threat. And it takes 4 seconds for a fully charged body shot, nobody's saying ""pick a spot, stand there and wait until you die"""
truetf2,3cp5g9,Kairu927,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"When you say you have a ""hard-scopey style"" to me that means during fights. Say on a midfight. Rather than constantly taking shots you slow down and try to hardscope angles. That is bound to get you punished by the enemy sniper, maybe the spy, maybe the scout, maybe the soldier.  During passive holds peeks are almost always better with a hardscope, unless you're trying to pop out and shoot someone whos exact spot you know. I can agree with you there"
truetf2,3cp5g9,neobowman,0,Mon Jul 13 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Alright, I haven't been on reddit in days so sorry for not getting back to you. Extra damage is a factor because the way you get kills in this game is by doing damage. The major threshold that you're breaking is you are able to kill things that are buffed more quickly, and by that I mean once a class with 125 hp is done being buffed by the medic, your waiting period before your bodyshot is shorter with the machina than it is when waiting with the stock (173hp vs 150hp).  Also if a demo or pyro is chipped for any damage whatsoever, they're gonna die to a bodyshot. Trust me, it happens much more often than you'd think. I guess it's one of those things that you need to ""see to believe"" and that's basically what I've seen. It's not a ""because I think it does"" moment, it's an ""I've seen it all the time and there's a pattern here"" moment."
truetf2,3cp5g9,catfield,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:58:18 2015 UTC,I meant against it in a ban sense but yeah. I suppose it's an argument for using it.  It only reply comes into play in higher level matches where pocket snipers are prevalent. I don't think it matters much under Gold but that's really the big issue with it.
truetf2,3cp5g9,SileAnimus,3,Fri Jul 10 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"Ive started using the Machina a lot more this season and I have to say I have really been enjoying it. Getting used to the tracer took no more than a day or 2 of playing with it in pubs to get past the weird placebo effect it has on your aim.   The only real downside I see with it is the lack of no scope shots. Im a huge fan of no scope shots for close range combat and finishing off weakened opponents, so that was easily the biggest obstacle and downside of the weapon IMO. I dont see the tracer as a downside (with the exception of a couple parts of maps with really long sight lines where you can actually stay hidden for a bit). In pubs its irrelevant and in comp most teams are going to call your position anyways.   The added damage and collateral effect though I feel more than make up for the lack of no scoping ability in comp simply due to the fact that teammates can protect you better. This means you have more time to get fully charged for easier picks on all classes. Its also better for holding down chokes. I do occasionally feel a bit more exposed with it when I get ambushed but honestly if another class is that close to me I should be dead anyways. Just my 2¢."

The success of DOTA 2 and CS:GO as esports has shown valve that there is money to be made in these competitive systems, so that's what they are investing in.   The hat fortress 2 and competitive systems can exist together, giving newer players to tf2 in general pubs to play on, and people that have put ungodly amounts of time into the game a more skilled environment to play.  Valve is not perfect, but their support is a good thing, and it's something the competitive tf2 community as a whole has been fighting for, for a long time."
truetf2,3clbgz,TheLocoMofo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:33:02 2015 UTC,While I never played Dota I can confirm they generally do seem to botch MM. Everyone says how csgo matchmaking made it so easy to play competitive failing to realize that it basically follows no competitive rules. Go play a csgo game on MM then go play a game on faceit  the difference is very noticeable especially when it comes to the extra 10 seconds on the bomb timer.
truetf2,3clbgz,Diamondimus_Prime,3,Thu Jul 9 18:14:25 2015 UTC,Round time and defuse time are pretty important but I wouldn't say having them at 2:00/:45 qualifies as botched matchmaking
truetf2,3clbgz,TheLocoMofo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:39:30 2015 UTC,In the sense that the game is nothing like real comp CS it is. For example on inferno in a real league setting bomb site retakes are generally never attempted because with that 10 second difference you don't have time to clear the site and defuse where as on matchmaking they're always attempted because 10 seconds means more time to clear site or more time to defuse after clearing site.
truetf2,3clbgz,Diamondimus_Prime,4,Fri Jul 10 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"I know how the differences in timers affects the game. Saying that the timers make the game ""nothing like comp CS"" and a ""botched MM"" is a pretty huge overstatement though. Hardly changes the playability of MM. They could have fucked up a lot harder"
truetf2,3clbgz,TheLocoMofo,0,Fri Jul 10 01:17:15 2015 UTC,Fair enough maybe I was a bit harsh in my wording but the main point I'm trying to make is that in the sense of league rules valve tends to fuck up when they do a comp matchmaking set up for tf2 I'm thinking they may do no weapon bans which I think could end up being a good or bad thing but time will fully tell I'm just not quite as hyped as some.
truetf2,3clbgz,TheCodexx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, gotta agree. MM for tf2 definitely has a lot more room for fuck ups from valve - class limits, weapon bans, weapon balance, map types, payload style, team size...  Hopefully they do their research.

They then tell the LAN org that they will give another 500 euros if they ban a former TF2C moderator from the LAN because they don't get on with him. DeutschLAN tell them to get stuffed and drop the sponsorship.  Since then a bunch of top level admins and moderators have left and TF2C were supposed to write an announcement which was delayed several times until Marty (Admin) posted the statement on ETF2L and TF2C.

While no names were mentioned, it was clear who it was from.  Let me be clear that I submitted a moderator application this past weekend. I saw the leaving of key admins as an opportunity for myself to contribute to a community that I have grown quite fond of. I am not afraid of voicing my concerns over the lack of professionalism and maturity over admins on this site, nor am I concerned that it will affect my acceptance into the moderation team. This cognitive dissonance is absolutely bizarre and unnerving, frankly.  Marty, thank you for the apology. I appreciate you taking the time to address the concerns (which have been surprisingly hush-hush here - a actually learned of the debacle from reddit) and an acknowledgement that tf2center fucked up. The ""you""s in  this post are directed at the administration staff (notably, MN) who apparently are full grown adults but choose to act like children on their own website.  I'm very disappointed in the way this was handled, and admins walking away speaks volumes on the state of the management here. I want to help. I want things to get better. Consider seeing the problem at its source.""   Additionally:  This makes me sad. I've always defended tf2c because it is a wonderful source for pugs, as well as a great way to meet friends. With any hobby I have, I want to share it with others, so the community is usually my first priority with places like tf2c. I've seen certain admins be cruel, arrogant, and ignore the protests of others regarding a medley of things. Other admins have been wonderful, inluding Fairy, kKatlUu, and Luop. I applied for a moderator position in hopes that I'd help the impending firestorm of somebody (admin) snapping, but I don't think I want to work in this environment.  I'm considering pulling my donor status.  Shame on you, Masternoob. Grow the fuck up."

Then the whole deutschLAN drama started and I was sure I won't donate there anytime soon.  And then the whole drama AFTER the initial deutschlan happened. Don't see a reason to play there anymore.

truetf2,3clbgz,plaguing,2,Thu Jul 9 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"The DeutschLAN  TF2C contribution fiasco is the only real killer worthy of notice to me here.   The rest is mostly pointless squabbling between people with too much time on their hands. For having been in lobbies with him, I agree to say when it comes to human interactions, MN is a... special case. But equally foolish are those who use this as a way to settle their petty vendettas, or even worse treat this as a simplistic ""victim community v shoddy badmins"" thing and take a free ride on the bandwagon. Insulting the other party doesn't make you a hero; it simply makes you look like a fool for stooping to your target's level.  The user base is not made up entirely of angels; in fact I would say that low-brow ""humour"", mediocrity and good ol' Dunning-Kruger are a fairly common sight. Just read the chats or the ban report threads in the forums. In all earnest, you are mediocre if you think calling yourself ""niggatron"" is funny, and even more more so for defending him as a victim of ""arbitrary"" censorship (boohoohoo) with dumb hashtags (which is redundant). You are mediocre if you think that spamming the general chat with twitch fail memes and openly insulting people is appropriate, and even more so if you get butthurt after you get chat-banned for it.  I particularly liked this passage from Hildreth's post:   7) Stop getting baited by trolls  I see a lot of the horror show chatlogs from admins being baited by ridiculous discussions. Like the “Niggatron” incident, MT deemed it worthy of a ban, and was fair, but then got into a ridiculous discussion with somebody who isn’t worth the IQ points of my driving licence. So he fed him lots of silly comments he could use to attempt to humiliate MT, who doesn’t deserve to be humiliated but he did give his time to someone who wasn’t worth it. Simple moderation guidelines and following them… solve this.   Some people were indeed victims of power trips and shoddy moderation which needs to be called out, and there is indeed a PR problem. Do not spoil these causes by spewing out hatred and acting like crazy chickens, because you won't get anything out of it and end up with a silly ""nobody wins"" scenario. There are people out there willing to address the issues with a cool head, so don't ruin it with needless stupidity."
truetf2,3clbgz,neobowman,3,Thu Jul 9 21:47:37 2015 UTC,Can you explain what happened? I used to be on TF2C every god damn day and was talked to a few admins / known players before I moved to CSGO.
truetf2,3clbgz,ThePooSlidesRightOut,8,Thu Jul 9 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"TF2C was sponsoring DeutchLAN, then realized they couldn't actually offer the prize pool (2000 euro). So they dropped it to 500. Ouch. Then, an admin bribed the prize to 1000 if they banned a former mod from the event. Double ouch. On top of that, 'general immaturity and unprofessional attitude by TF2C' (probably Masternoob, the TF2C super admin). Triple ouch. Deutchlan happily dropped TF2C from sponsorship, and repped tf2pickup.net.   pastebin.com/EztjH3Xj  Then, the walls started coming down. Admins from TF2C started resigning. TF2C and TF2's comp community turned onto Masternoob and Mother Thereza, calling them immature and mean, respectively. One of the big arguments is 'MN and MT should resign, and it would fix many many things.' If not, the consequence is that TF2C may be phased out (which is going to be difficult, because TF2C is so big and currently has no replacement).  Then TF2C issued an apology made by Terry Crews (also 'Marty'), an admin. We liked it. Masternoob didn't. It was promptly deleted, and TC was quickly stripped of his duty by Masternoob and renamed ""clown.""   http://www.teamfortress.tv/thread/26829/why-it-s-time-to-say-goodbye-to-tf2center  http://i.imgur.com/hSFcgao.png  This one is great. Masternoob is caught out saying 'I have a vacation to plan for, good luck with the shitstorm.'  Now, we see what happens next. If MN/+MT resign, if Valve's Competitive update is going to outshine TF2C, if another lobby website takes this opportunity and outshines TF2C, or if TF2C comes crashing to the ground. For now, TF2C has no replacement. Hopefully things change."

truetf2,3cmuex,silver_nuke13,7,Thu Jul 9 16:56:35 2015 UTC,Anything works in pubs. Booties were viable in pubs even before the speed buff which to be honest isn't even that great. 10% speed increase is barely noticeable.  And now that sticky damage has been fixed/nerfed again you'll need pipes if you want to deal lot of damage.  Booties + quickie is a decent combo but the pathetic damage of stickies on airdets means you won't be very effective except in 1v1 situations.
truetf2,3cmuex,L-iNC,11,Thu Jul 9 08:38:26 2015 UTC,"10% speed increase means you're faster than average speed classes like pyro and spy by a small amount, I'd say it's noticeable"
truetf2,3cmuex,-ThG-13thDoctor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:07 2015 UTC,Much more noticeable for demonights trying to catch up to get the melee. But yea with stikies not too noticeable. Helps some when backing away and laying a line of stikies.

truetf2,3cmuex,Perfect_Perception,6,Thu Jul 9 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"I think that booties work as an alternate play style, but definitely have their trade offs. You no longer can rely on pipes as a finishing tool at close range. So anything that gets in your face is stuck there until a teammate or some self damaging stickies get it out. On the upside, you have the extra health to do it!  So could it be run full time theoretically, but it's a pretty even trade off."
truetf2,3cmuex,PineMaple,5,Thu Jul 9 03:50:33 2015 UTC,"I've watched a few HL scrims and matches where the demo ran booties fulltime and it was incredibly effective. Although you don't have the pipes to get people out of your face, you can get tanked to 300 and be speedy. If you have decent stick aim then you can definitely make it work, although you will need to be careful about ammo management and make sure to always have a couple extra sticks loaded if anyone rushes you."
truetf2,3cmuex,SUSAltd,6,Thu Jul 9 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"I've been ""forced"" into using it full-time sometimes (using it on mid and not dying) and all I can say is that I feel very uncomfortable having only stickies. For example I can put up a trap if we're holding an area but I can't do anything else if I want to keep the trap up since I don't have anything else to spam with."

truetf2,3cmuex,13_Polo,8,Thu Jul 9 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Demoman runs at 93% speed. With booties this is 103%, slightly faster than normal (medic runs at 107%). Skullcutter runs at 79% normally, or 89% with booties. So just a little slower than normal demoman."

truetf2,3cmuex,Bucksbelly,6,Thu Jul 9 12:50:42 2015 UTC,"I am not exactly sure, but I believe booties make you faster than normal speed classes (pyro, engi, spy etc.) and just a bit slower than medic.

truetf2,3cmuex,Mankut,2,Thu Jul 9 13:43:06 2015 UTC,It's amazing. Faster speed lets you reposition yourself and get to mid faster. The extra health makes you super tanky.

truetf2,3cmuex,Shady_Love,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:13 2015 UTC,They'll be most useful on long maps like granary (for run speed) and other rollouts that you could get 1 more jump on to be considerably faster.   Possibly on viaduct if you want to be a bit more invincible and don't bother with traps.
truetf2,3cmuex,ScootPilgrim,2,Thu Jul 9 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"More viable in HL than 6s I would think.

There is a chance that the uber mechanic is downright unhealthy for the game. Makes the game based on luck or something and just not healthy for competition. I'm not saying this is true, I'm saying this is a possibility.  What UGC is doing, to the best of my understanding, is saying that ""We will look into this change, but we won't let this potentially game breaking change affect this season. We will look at it at the off-season when there aren't any consequences"". I think this is the right course of action personally."

It makes everything even harder for new Medics.  It's a bad mechanic, that doesn't punish your team for losing a Medic on last hold. Assuming you prevented enemy's uber push but your Medic died, he simply respawns, picks up his Medi Gun and gets up to a full uber advantage for an easy push. Like this.

The proper procedure would be preventing them from getting into jumping position all together. Your demo should be stickying chokepoint corners while your scouts and roamer control your flank, they have to say if the enemy roamer is passing through the flank so your medic can position himself accordingly."
truetf2,3cjk9b,Kiltredash,6,Wed Jul 8 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest if you're low level, most bombers come from the same place again and again.

truetf2,3cjk9b,liuwqf,4,Wed Jul 8 13:24:21 2015 UTC,"You need to anticipate jumpers especially after a push from your side or theirs. You can't do all THAT much if your med stands still or can't surf, but always stay on the guard for jumpers during said periods. With that being said, I agree with /u/BLEEARGH just check out Froyo in the past, they'd keep b4nny with Shade to deny all jumpers and send off clckwrk, you need to be able to rely on your scouts in that case, especially the one you send off to exchange frags if anything.  If your medic doesn't know how to surf, TEACH HIM. Show him Mirelin and KnOxXx. Dikker is also a great example. If anything give him Mirelin's crouchjump script which helps with surfs. As a medic I mostly rely on myself when jumpers come in and surf/survive as much as I can until whoever jumped me is down, but they might even send someone else... positioning is also a big factor in this, don't put your med at choke when you're 'holding' your spire for instance, or just tell him to back the fuck off and rotate heals  Don't let your med drop also, tell him it's ok to get forced but make good use of it and try to get a positioning that would put you in advantage, if your med gets forced FLASH YOUR DEMO I CANNOT EMPATHIZE ON THIS ENOUGH, your demo can literally flip the tides and force THEIR med if you both had charges, flash demo and go out there for blood, you're not there to be a beauty you're there to exchange ubers"

Quoted from  TFTV:   There's a few spam angles that are only possible with the original. I used this one everytime my medic was climbing spire on badlands:  http://i.imgur.com/NjYfQbT.jpg?1 For this reason alone I think it's objectively better.  I also think it's better for the current map pool's corners. Lots of people think it just equalizes out since you're better at some corners and worse at others, but it really doesn't. Some corners matter a lot more, like peeking top when defending badlands last. It's way easier to peek that with the original than the normal RL. I actually went through most maps and figured I should swap to left-handed models, but decided against it since I valued the spam angles + easier pogo routes with the original."

truetf2,3cfql2,twilightvomit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"there's actually a difference for the way the rockets travel between left handed/right handed/original at close ranges. you just have to find out if there is a specific map to switch it.   (i though of viaduct, on blue side around ""china"" or near the tunnel, having the left handed viewmodel for rocket would have an advantage)"
truetf2,3cfql2,veachh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"This comes up in the jump.tf forums all the fucking time.  Objectively speaking, I'll say a few things:  1 - The original is slightly better for pogos.  It's just more consistent.   2 - The stock is slightly better for more horizontally oriented or speedier jumps, but only from right-walls.  This is just due to the angle the rocket comes out of you relative to the wall which can give you a bit more forward momentum.   3 - Despite these small pros/cons, both can do all jumps.    And where comp is concerned..  4 - the angles do equalize.  Right-hugging certain walls to fire around (LOS'ing) targets is an enormous advantage vs hitscan classes, but the stock can't do left walls.  The original is decent at both instead of specializing.  If you were still able to bind to switch between left and right-handed, the stock would be easily the best choice, but it depends on the map and what positions you favor.   5 - The original is more silent and honestly does help roamers get the jump on people.    I use the original by default but spent the last 2 years using the stock much more to stay versed in both.  For example, the big/fast rollout in process is better with the stock; I find it more consistently able to give me the speed I need to land at their sewer door before any of them appear on mid (on HL), letting me grab the health and take out their sniper or med and be a general douche.  But for other routes, especially if I need more versatility (using both walls on various map elements), I find the original a better choice.  I just like how well-rounded it is."

More edit:  I think  sv_cheats 1 tf_debug_damage 1   will allow you to see how the rounding actually works. I did a quick test now and it confirms my claim about rounding to nearest whole number. To use this, I would deal damage and open the console, and it would show the un-rounded damage. You can compare that to damage displayed by your HUD (6s for Degreaser, 7s for Flamethrower) and confirm that it is in fact rounding down for Degreaser and rounding up for Flamethrower."

At 330 HU, which is about the limit of the flame thrower's reliability, I've recorded (4.83, 4.95) dpp with nospread. For testing the flame thrower, I use +attack in console for upwards of 10 min. per distance checked, then look at the condump, but it's quite possible my min./max. are inaccurate.

We cooled down and talked about what was messing us up, and where.  Second half rolls around and we fight hard, managing to take a very close round and get us hyped up, momentum was now in our favor. We rode that for a solid two more rounds, each more convincing than the prior.  We were now 3-3, super hype and going into OT.  We talk and hype ourselves up, this is it, next round takes all.  We go right in, get solid picks, deny their bombs and get the clock down low before they cap.  It comes down to us bleeding a lot as the timer hits 0:01 and they cap.

truetf2,3cdmh7,TheYellowCellPhone,3,Wed Jul 8 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"NA Steel, Egg Salad Dressing (us) against Glamour Squad. We lost 4-2. That brings us to a win-loss of 4-2.  We rescheduled today because Glamour was going to have to use three subs, and it didn't seem right to any of us to face a team that wasn't at its fullest strength. Plus we spent most of our time since Badwater playing the Terraria 1.3 update like a bunch of casuals, so one more day to warm back into TF2 didn't seem like a bad idea.  I believe it went that we won the first round, lost the next two, won a second, then lost to conclude the half. After the half they obviously got the fourth win to end the game. The first few rounds we were still knocking off cap time, but our egregious midfights and Glamour adapting to us lead to us getting less and less time on the rounds we were losing.  I don't have much to say about the match other than Glamour Squad is obviously a better, more experienced, and all around more solid team than us. Our positioning was pretty screwy the entire game, plus our DM just wasn't up to par to what the Glamour Squad was throwing at us. For a team comprised of a bunch of pubbuddies around two weeks before the season, I'm shocked we've come this far in our first season and are able to knock a few rounds out of teams like Glamour Squad.  I thought it was a really great game, even if my teammates are a little bummed at their (and sadly, other team member's) performances.  I personally felt like this was an improvement over my performances on Badwater and Steel. I've been feeling pretty guilty for my team since I've been shitting the bed as far as my performance, but this is the first match since I think Gullywash where I felt like I contributed. I still choked hard when a Medic came in my sight.  Onto cp_glassworks.

The rest of the team weren't spectacular either, but not quite as bad.  Our team is doing much better now that I switched to pyro instead of medic. No mic for medic is awful, but no mic for pyro doesn't matter too much. I'm staying glued to the combo, former pyro would pretty much play roamer. So the combo is stronger than before, gives our pushes some actual oomph."

truetf2,3cdxdy,MrDoomBunny,3,Tue Jul 7 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"If you imagine your team as a literal fortress, Heavy is the wall."
truetf2,3cdxdy,Stormwatch36,14,Thu Jul 9 05:45:36 2015 UTC,"the big one, practice tracking.  you basically have one job:  learn how to stare at things until they die.  it's your hammer and everyone attacking you and the combo are the nails.  perfect it.  make people angry and accuse you of hacking without actually doing it.    also, usually positioning, dictated by how your combo plays.  it'll allow (or not) you the options of combo guardian or roaming heavy.  both are viable so long as you and your combo are on the same page and the map allows for it.    studying.  no, really, study up.  know the map you're playing back and front, watch video of all levels of heavy play.  doing so will help you learn what works (higher level play) and what doesn't (usually lower level play).    play every class while in pubs on competitive maps if you're able to get on servers that host them.  this can teach you how other classes attack/defend/approach/avoid/etc the combo while a heavy is alive.  and same with studying up, watch other videos of all levels of plays.  it's huge knowing spy hiding spots and movement paths to get behind you.  it can teach sniper sight lines to avoid and soldier/demo bombing flight paths which are huge with avoiding needless deaths and defending the combo."
truetf2,3cdxdy,fireshaker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:11:12 2015 UTC,"This is a very good description of what to do. If I can add onto what you've said, I'd suggest c-tapping as well. As a heavy, we're slow and vulnerable when spun up and can easily get headshot. But if we constantly are ducking and maintaining our speed it makes us a tougher target."
truetf2,3cdxdy,B-Lund,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"c-tapping is a jumping term for a very specific type of jump, you're just using crouching to change your hitbox"
truetf2,3cdxdy,vaylren,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"Any sniper worth a damn will just shoot you, headshot or not, and let someone clean you up.  if a flank or well aiming demo is out for blood after you take a shot for trying to c-tap without an explosion to propel you, you're highly likely to die.    though you can get pushed by multiple sources of bullets hitting you, the single sniper shot will not help you get away if you're in terrible position.  you should always be aiming to be where you need to be.  as vague as that sounds, it's actually as best described as you can get it.    you can get away with shenanigans like this on occasion, especially up to about mid-high silver, but once you're playing high level and teams have better coordination, focus fire, AND DM, all the c-tapping you have isn't going to save you."

truetf2,3cdxdy,Stormwatch36,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"Be powerful looking and stay back/safe more often than you want to. Don't try to get up in the enemy's face all the time, let them come to you. You are a giant thing in the back/center of your team that they have to take out before they can accomplish anything. Guard the Medic, watch for bombers and spies, and give every push your immense weight. Heavy is like the wall of the team. Where he is, it's safe.  EDIT: Your health is an asset, not a liability. Engineers are pretty good about their dispenser, usually, that's one of the first things your team will make sure they get drilled into his head. On top of good old Medic, you'll have so much health that you'll be able to eat some damage on purpose. Just make sure to retreat on time, and that will keep other tiny baby men alive. It's part of being the wall."
truetf2,3cd7a6,ElagabalusRex,17,Tue Jul 7 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every change was big. Just read through the whole thing and from your own opinions, even in plat the meta is still being formed."
truetf2,3cd7a6,MrDoomBunny,3,Tue Jul 7 00:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty wide ranging and big changes. I'm still getting my head around them and I'm usually pretty on top of things TF2-wise  Generally my thoughts -  A lot of 'situational' weapons were either buffed directly (and well pretty well) across the board or indirectly by being able to pick up enemy weapons. Say if you're rocking the new Natascha and using it to tank for your team and you want to get ready for a push, kill an enemy heavy running stock or tomislav and take his gun if you can.   Scorch Shot/Detonator changes means it's a lot easier to set a lot of people on fire from any range. As a Pyro player this makes me very happy and this makes afterburn more threatening (in pubs at least) as most extinguishes are one-use or require medics/dispensers.   Spies got buffs across the board, Dead Ringer is really confusing now and hard to predict which is kind of a buff. Cloak changes are great for escaping single players but you're still gonna die if found by a group.   Engi changes are very good quality of life stuff, teles and dispensers redeploy super fast and the annoying stuff like Wrangler/Pomson/Short circuit/Gunslinger got nerfed, while the Jag and Eureka Effect got pretty good buffs and are actually good at what they were meant to do.   Haven't toyed too much with soldier changes but the Air Strike is really easy and fun to use now.  Sydney Sleeper change is pretty good if you're a bad sniper like me, that instant jarate is sometimes enough to take down an overhealed heavy trying to out damage a sentry. Cosy Camper change is probably huge if you're actually a good sniper."
truetf2,3cd7a6,Frankly109,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"Gonna have to disagree with the ""spies got buffs across the board."" DR and Spycicle are a lot less viable now, because DR only blocks half the damage that triggers the feign, and damage resistance scales down until de-cloak. Spycicle only provides fire immunity for 1 second now, compared to 3 before. To make up for those, Kunai, Big Earner, Invis Watch, and C&D got buffed. Overall, it's a return to what the spy was before the DR/Spycicle combo became really powerful."
truetf2,3cd7a6,Zorronin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"I dunno about 'a lot less viable', as a Pyro it's a lot harder to track both the DR and Spycicle due to the changes. The afterburn change on the Spycicle is a really pain in the arse to track if the spy slips past, especially if he has the DR speed boost and you're pretty much never going to catch him before he find health/ammo.   They're less straight-up bullshit (oh hey I've found this obvious spy and know he's here and can't kill him/burn him) and more useful in other ways (escapes), I like the changes. Talking about general pub experiences here not competitive."
truetf2,3cfr7x,-Josh,9,Tue Jul 7 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"I also disagree. Snipers with razorback are already killable by either a skilled, lone spy or a little bit of coordination.   If neither of the two are present, the spy doesn't deserve the kill."
truetf2,3cfr7x,RedSquaree,4,Tue Jul 7 17:16:37 2015 UTC,Id say no overheal only downside.
truetf2,3cfr7x,Gamer880,5,Tue Jul 7 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"Too strong of a nerf. Way too strong. Limiting a class to 115 hp offers them no sustainability whatsoever. They will melt under anything and everything. Removing overheal prevents them from counteracting that debuff temporarily, and a -10 health bonus confers no difference to the ""health gate"", as the only reason 15 health would matter is in instances where damage falloff from long range spam comes into effect. Otherwise pretty much anything that would two-shot at 125 health, will two-shot at 115. No meaningful difference.  The current downside to the razorback is the lack of support you get from a secondary, and the upside is the psychological effect of being ""unbackstabbable"". That is to say, nobody considers the razorback a 2 stab kill. They consider it as a shutdown of their ability to stab a sniper, which it is. However, the trade off to this is the inability to support yourself (or your team) with secondaries that increase damage output at ranges a sniper is a sitting duck at.  So the razorback, while wholly annoying, prevents snipers from being able to reliably deal with anything that gets just inside their personal bubble. They have to rely on teammates to do that."
truetf2,3cfr7x,Perfect_Perception,6,Tue Jul 7 16:36:13 2015 UTC,"i disagree, i think the razorback is fine as it is. the problem i have with your suggestion is that the downside of the razorback comes into play when your back gets stabbed: the fact that you have no secondary. a spy could stab your razorback and then escape, forcing you to either run back to spawn and putting you out of the fight or risk getting backstabbed. the razorback has inherent negatives simply because of fact that you sacrifice a secondary for potential survivability"

truetf2,3cfr7x,catfield,2,Tue Jul 7 17:39:23 2015 UTC,"I think ""just blocks overheal"" is fine. A competent Spy should be able to kill a Razorback Sniper using any gun just fine."
truetf2,3cfr7x,Azmek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that would actually be a super-good nerf, because the meta right now is for the medic to keep the sniper at 185 so he can survive a headshot. Blocking overheal might shake up the secondary choices for Sniper."
truetf2,3cfr7x,Zorronin,2,Sat Jul 11 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"Trying not to sound like a super-biased spymain  Snipers dominate this game at a top level.  Simple as that.  Nerfing the razorback is better than banning the thing, as it makes snipers choose their secondary more carefully.  With buffs to the cozy camper, and JB combo being really strong, I could see more than JUST the razorback being used.  It'd be really nice knowing there is a way to counter a sniper.  Nowadays it takes a spy headshot along with some team spam, which is a ton to ask to kill one class.  I say a nerf would be great, although your stipulations seem a little steep."

UGC as a league might be rendered irrelevant entirely anyways, as only ESEA offers a reason to use their league with bolstered anti-cheat.    You've got two arguments going here, neither of which make any real sense. First, leagues have always made efforts to keep playing fields as level as possible. Anything that forces an opposing player to lock themselves into the same weapon choices, or has the potential to be outright stronger than other weapons of their class, tend be banned. The Airstrike isn't outright better off the bat. But it's conditions for becoming the best rocket launcher are: Jumping in the air, and/or getting a single kill to offset damage penalties entirely. That's pretty ridiculous.  Also, given that the league is mid-season, ""band-aid"" bans are going to be done to preserve the validity of the season. As is, a lot of players dislike that there wasn't a bye week in ugc so that the time to sort out the new weapons, config fixes, and a look at the new weapon pickup addition could be had. Even without it, the community made some damning arguments in a short time span, as to why a few things needed to be removed from competitive play.  Second, ESEA's anti-cheat is laughable at best, and the integrity of those running (edit: as in the people behind it, not the userbase. Though the argument could be made in a different context) the client has been lost with multiple abuses of injecting the client with some form of bullshit or another."

UGC and the like won't be rendered obsolete unless Valve does an absolutely stellar job with their matchmaking; and arguably not even then unless they provide a league of their own.  At most lobbies are the only things really at risk since they're basically just pubs with a competitive ruleset anyway.  And last, the entire reason why there's a huge gap between comeptitive and pub tf2 is because Valve has a horrendous reputation for balancing TF2 post-release.  If the competitive community is expected to bend over the table for every mechanic valve pumps out without even the slightest forewarning, then the gap between pubs and competitive will never be closed."

It's also a game where you can literally play it as a full time job, so y'knowwwwww its a little different. CSGO MM is the best thing to happen to the FPS esports scene EVER. Like idk if u remember but 5 years ago esports in general were kind of dying, and even now FPS are really only supported by CSGO."

I'm surprised you're in low open, because that implies you're on a team, a feat which is surprising considering your absolutely terrible compensating-for-something attitude."
truetf2,3cawpx,MovkeyB,-5,Mon Jul 6 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"incorrect   yr entire post was literally just personal attacks, but like whatever im not low open here's my looking thread tell people i was mean on reddit or w/e"
truetf2,3cawpx,gay_pedophile,3,Mon Jul 6 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"That just confirmed mostly what I thought:   he's not toxic anymore i promise  very trash player, rage shit talk u have it all in this guy  Could use some work on his attitude but he's a super solid pocket. would b fine with the right group of ppl  he is a giant baby but BOY CAN THAT BABY SHOOT SOME SWELL ROCKETS  Cool guy, but when he gets mad he will stop calling stuff and give up on trying to win.   good dm, likes to play the game, and gets community banned for racism every 3 months.  After being on Flatline's team for a week he went on tilt halfway through a scrim saying he had tendinitis, raged, and proceeded to remove everyone. 19 year old man with the psychology of a 14 year old girl whos parents said she couldn't go to the Fall Out Boy concert.  However, he has real problems with his emotional state. If you start losing or something bad happens you might not get comms for the rest of the scrim, or even the night. He seems to get really angry really easily, sometimes warranted and sometimes unwarranted.   You seem to be fairly skilled at the game but your attitude is terrible. You should work on that."

truetf2,3cawpx,TheCodexx,5,Mon Jul 6 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"i also know more than you, yr just a LITERAL child lol   I'm older than you buddy.    im better than you'll ever be lol   That can't be measured considering you play soldier and I play med   (im not saying this to put u down, im saying it because you being less experienced at TF2 than me is the reason u dont have a CLUE what yr talking about btw)   You're compensating hard buddy."
truetf2,3c9ch6,Sideshow-,11,Mon Jul 6 02:44:46 2015 UTC,Anyone know an application that would allow you to draw on an image in real time and have other people see it?
truetf2,3c9ch6,swicki,13,Mon Jul 6 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"Try tacnet.io, it even has symbols for TF2"
truetf2,3c9ch6,Ecophagy,5,Mon Jul 6 07:42:51 2015 UTC,"tacnet is hands up the best solution. I've used it with several teams, as long as you disable drawing for specific dick-loving team mates it's a cake walk for explaining tactics."
truetf2,3c9ch6,kkaltuu,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:14:14 2015 UTC,thanks
truetf2,3c9ch6,swicki,5,Mon Jul 6 17:12:57 2015 UTC,That's part of the reason I collected them :D possibly working on something like that #secret
truetf2,3c9ch6,swicki,2,Mon Jul 6 07:03:39 2015 UTC,that sounds awesome.
truetf2,3c9ch6,solomondg,3,Mon Jul 6 07:09:15 2015 UTC,Probably could just use Paint and stream it to Twitch or use Skype screen sharing.
