She said, based on her appearance, she didn't really have to; it was just assumed.   On one hand, I'm glad I can ""blend"" when I feel necessary and on the other hand, I kinda wish it wasn't necessary to have the big coming out thing all the time, to everyone I meet."

I am just about positive she would have figured it out if I were a man. And I don't think she suspects anything bc I am invisible (even more so for being in a relationship with a dude! :X). It's like, do I wish she could tell I'm queer? That would open me up to the possibility of rejection but also the possibility of greater things and ugh idk"

actuallesbians,3e2zc5,rab0t,9,Tue Jul 21 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"The MOST IMPORTANT THING is not to cut her off from you and your love. If you need time to think things through, to question, or even to deal with feelings of loss or confusion, that is totally okay, but your daughter should NOT be the sounding board for those emotions. There may be organizations in your area, such as PFLAG, to provide support for parents just like you, and they'll have resources, discussion groups, and other ways to help you navigate this new information. The fact that you are totally supportive and you want to be there for your daughter is phenomenal. If you express to her that you're supportive and you're open to her advice if, for example, you say or do something that offends her, that'd be huge. Having a parent who's also an ally is a huge blessing to any queer person, and it's something a lot of us never experience. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being that kind of mom. :)"
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,rab0t,8,Tue Jul 21 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think I could ever love her less, but it is confusing.  I would LOVE to join a group like that, my 'mom-friends' have straight kids and most of them are used to that idea and know how to go about certain things.  She has already been teaching me about sexualities and gender identities, if they are confusing because the definition of bisexuality was pretty straightforward until she asked if I thought about those who were attracted to- in her exact words- 'non-cis' genders (This should really be a class or be taught in schools. The fact that my teenage daughter is teaching me about this is odd.) She's a very stubborn, wonderfully vocal girl and has voiced her discomfort over certain things myself or family member have said in the past.   Thank you so much, I'm really trying!!"
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,Thessalonike,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Just trying is INCREDIBLE. And hey, if you ever want a totally non-judgmental queer person to talk to about things you don't understand or have questions about, or even if you just need to vent, I'd love to talk to you, so please feel free to send me a PM. My parents don't accept my sexuality at all (though our relationship has improved in recent years), so I'd be happy to help someone else stay connected to her kid.

actuallesbians,3e2zc5,IngridDruslan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"So, an aside based on your comment - this stuff is starting to be taught in schools, lol :P  Ontario is introducing a new ""sex ed"" curriculum this year for it's schools, which in elementary school does start talking not only about things like personal space and the idea of consent (introduced early on to talk about things like sharing and giving hugs), but also about different sexualities, and gender identity (which I personally think is great news, being trans myself).  Though as I am sure you can imagine, some more conservative parents are not in agreement with the new curriculum :/"
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,Kristouph,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:51 2015 UTC,That's amazing! Go Canada!  We live in a conservative state in the U.S. So I can only imagine the parents' reactions. I hope that they implement it anyway and I would love to see what that does for that generations outlook on those topics!
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,Lysah,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I'd like to elaborate on /u/rab0t/ post: do not change your attitude towards your daughter. She is still the same person she was yesterday, you just happen to know more about her now.   Do not make your insight a huge thing, take it in stride. Her SO might be called Jill instead of Bill, so what?  What is important is that your daughter is happy and safe.   Even if you crave for them, do not mention the desire for (bloodline) grandchildren.   Apart from that, support her as you would have done yesterday, respond to her insecurities (if there are any - I do not know her age) objectively and just treat her revelation in a kind of ""I don't like cheese cake"" way. Acknowledged, but no big deal. The sky has not fallen and the sun will still come up tomorrow. So your next question, after addressing any questions, should be more like ""OK, so what would you like for lunch"" instead of ""Wow, which girl do you have a crush on?"".  PS.: being here and asking respectfully I believe you are already on the right lane!"
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,Thessalonike,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"It's so funny you mention children! When she was around four, she marched right up to me with her baby dolls and said she never wants one! At the time she was mimicking my sister (she had dropped off her first baby for a 'mommy day out'), but hasn't changed her stance since. I have two other wonderful children, and an amazing step-daughter hopefully one of them will decide to have kids! It's not my place to decide for them, though.  I will do my best not to make anything of it! She actually has a date with, from what I've heard (which is from a biased source: my daughter), a great girl! I'm proud she approached the girl with clear intentions and it worked out for her! Thank you for the advice!"
actuallesbians,3e2zc5,Thessalonike,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:39 2015 UTC,"I am totally supportive    YAY! You're the BEST! Keep it up.  Love conquers all, so keep that going and don't worry too much about what not to do. There are awkward questions most of us like to avoid, so you might check out my post Lesbian FAQs for the Curious. There are better ones on Autostraddle and other lesbian emagazines, but I've lost the links to those. Here are a couple ideas based on moms I've known:  1) Don't pick her girlfriends. Only mention the positives of anyone she brings home. She will learn the hard way about good/bad people -- the same way you learned.  2) Don't tell anyone on your own. Your neighbor Margaret never told you about her swingers club because everyone has an expectation of privacy. Talk to your daughter about how ""out"" she wants to be and who knows and who she'd rather not ever tell.  3) Depending on how old she is, she might be confused about quite a few things herself. I'm 28 and found this forum to be the most supportive and consistent anywhere for embarrassing questions and advice.  4) Before you hang a rainbow flag in the living room window, ask her how much ""support"" she expects or wants from you.   Good luck! She's a lucky girl to have a mom willing to post for advice. Mine still thinks I'm going through a phase :)"

actuallesbians,3e2nl3,Tangurena,5,Tue Jul 21 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"I usually recommend some books on this subject because it lets you read about other women's experiences: Dear John, I love Jane. Living Two Lives. Married Women Who Love Women. Late Bloomers.   I'm starting to realize that maybe I don't enjoy sex with him      You might be gay or you might be asexual. Aces do masturbate.    For some sexual arousal is a fairly regular occurrence, though it is not associated with a desire to find a sexual partner or partners. Some asexuals will occasionally masturbate, but feel no desire for partnered sexuality. Other asexual people experience little or no arousal. Asexual people generally do not see a lack of sexual arousal as a problem to be corrected, and focus their energy on enjoying other types of arousal and pleasure.       http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Asexuality     I check out women in my day to day life... I fantasize about trying sex with women.     Probably not ace."
actuallesbians,3e2nl3,Tangurena,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I used to think I was asexual when I was younger, but I think I was in some form of denial or something about liking women. But now that I'm older, and now that I see and am aroused by specific things women do to eachother, and fantasize about being able to do the same thing, I think I may actually be a lesbian.   Thank you for the book links! I will definitely read them. Personal experience and stories and feelings and perspectives is exactly what I was looking for.   Feeling alone in a confusing situation like this is the worst thing ever."
actuallesbians,3e2nl3,IngridDruslan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"Feeling alone in a confusing situation like this is the worst thing ever.   I totally agree.   If you have a local LGBT center, they may have a discussion group for folks who are newly out. Part of why I'm a fan of discussion groups is to shatter the ""I'm the only one"" feeling. There is a sense of power that comes from seeing and meeting others in the same situation."

""and it's always lesbian porn"" is huge sign #2. ""I fantasize about trying sex with women."" Yep. Confirmed.  And the icing on the cake? You went to three different forums to ask if you're gay--because you already know the answer.   That's my take. The other posters here have more depth behind their advice.

actuallesbians,3e2nl3,markoyolo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"If you have any lesbianism in you, going down this path will absolutely change and rock your world. It will also change and rock the worlds of your husband and child. There is no light and easy way to do it, unless you actually are asexual.  I don't say this to scare you off, because I think one's sexuality is so powerful and innate that denying it creates serious emotional issues for oneself and one's family.  From my observations here and in my own life, once you start down this path there is no turning back while being true to yourself. You need to consider your child and husband as you process.   Some women approach this by first getting their husband to agree to opening up the relationship, either by bringing another woman to bed with the 2 of you, or allowing you to explore on the side.   Several women in this subreddit have been down this path; I'll let them talk more about it. So I just want to say welcome, and please hang around here and post as you go along whenever you would like some input."
actuallesbians,3e2nl3,KittyAng3l,-11,Tue Jul 21 15:31:14 2015 UTC,Sex isn't important for a relationship. Sorry it bugs me when people put such an emphasis on sex.

actuallesbians,3dzm9a,toastedenigma,23,Mon Jul 20 23:11:29 2015 UTC,I'm saving this one for later. Absolutely bloody glorious!
actuallesbians,3dzm9a,QuarterSooner,17,Mon Jul 20 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"I think the point is to de-escalate the encounter. Nobody likes being rejected, and being rejected for something you have no control over- in this case, being the wrong sex- feels especially unfair. Not suggesting that that excuses the rude, pushy, personal-identity-invalidating behavior of guys like this, just making a point about human psychology. If you can discourage them by saying something nice about someone else rather than saying something mean about them, that just brings things to a less acrimonious end- and it prevents you from sinking to their level."
actuallesbians,3dzm9a,VeryGoodKarma,14,Tue Jul 21 03:03:57 2015 UTC,Agreed that the point is de-escalation. I've been with people who don't have the first clue how to de-escalate a situation and it's frankly terrifying.  Counterpoint: de-escalation strategies are rarely humorous.
actuallesbians,3dzm9a,hobbular,6,Tue Jul 21 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"Fully in agreement with your first statement. I know people who when they start to raise their voices towards others my instinct is to run screaming from the building and not stop until I'm in another state, lest I be caught in the blast radius.  And in response to your second statement, that's unfortunately true. It's less fun and tends to require you to get into 'serious' mode and kill your buzz. I really like /u/toastedenigma's suggestion above about buying a bus ticket, and the more I think about it the more I think it illustrates a really interesting principle of communication.  When you respond by insulting your unwanted suitor (can lesbians be suitors? that word sounds so male) you're shifting your rejection from something he can't control that shouldn't be a measure of his worth (maleness), which his reflex is to dismiss as irrational, to something he has some control over and is the typical standard of attractiveness (beauty/ugliness), which he can understand more easily, but is hurtful and which he'll tend to reject if he considers it unfounded (and OF COURSE he'll consider it unfounded if he's the type to do this); you're basically just demonstrating that you will hurt him verbally until he stops bothering you, which is effective as a deterrent, but has little else going for it.  /u/toastedenigma's suggestion, on the other hand is so great because A) it completely avoids the pitfall of trying to say anything at all about the unwanted suitor- you're not engaging with him, neither insulting him nor giving an excuse for rejection that he can debate and B) (and this is the really neat part) it achieves the desired end through actual communication- you're demonstrating to him your interest in women by broadcasting that you're a sexual threat to his sibling, something he's wired to respond to defensively if you're at all convincing, and that reflexive defensive response on his own part is a thing he just can't argue with- you've literally gotten the idea across, rather than just merely dissuaded him with painful barbs. He can keep trying by suggesting that you're bi, but leaning on that defensive response forces him to recognize that he's not dealing with a straight girl, which completely changes the encounter. Plus, you know, it's unexpected and funny and lightens the mood.  Oh god it is so late here and I need to be in bed and instead I'm over analyzing put down lines from strangers on the internet goddess help me with a foot to the head. And no I am not any fun at parties at all."

actuallesbians,3dzm9a,Thelastunicorn1,8,Tue Jul 21 03:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think that women generally try to play nice (because they kinda feel they have to), until they absolutely hit the brick wall, and assholes take advantage of that, and test to see how far they can go.   Deescalating the situation isn't in your interest at all, why would you care? If someone is being a jerk (and they know they are being a jerk, you can't possibly say something that stupid and then wonder why you got called out on it), it's only fair to be a jerk back. If you just roll over and try to explain nicely from a side of empathy, they'll think they are right to express their petty emotions that way.   My prefered philosophy is ""talk shit, get hit."" Metaphorically, just to make that clear."
actuallesbians,3dzm9a,Cat_killed_curiosity,5,Tue Jul 21 08:36:02 2015 UTC,"It took me a moment to digest your points, and I don't disagree with them, so it took me another moment to figure out why I still thought de-escalation was the preferable option. The realization was very sobering: I honestly don't feel safe making threatening people angrier by calling them out on their bullshit; I've done it before and paid dearly for it. My experience is, when you confront someone with their delusions they usually just become enraged and lash out, and no one is going to be interested in getting between you and the animal you've ""provoked"". Maybe this is because I come from a crazy family, or maybe it's because I've lived my whole life in the deep south."
actuallesbians,3dzm9a,VeryGoodKarma,5,Tue Jul 21 08:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get where you're coming from, and that's why I think women in general lean to the de-escalation side of solving a problem.   Statistically, you're a lot more likely to run into someone physically stronger than you than an average male is. And even if we live in a civilized society and it's not really likely someone is just gonna come out and start physically assaulting you for it, there's still this underlining feeling that the other person could hurt you if they really wanted to. That's giving them power they shouldn't have.   It might be a bit of a pickle to overcome that feeling, but I think just letting bullies get away with what they might not even be aware is bullying because it's implicit (it's a threat, it mostly doesn't really happen, but a threat is enough to alter your behavior) is a worse option."

actuallesbians,3dz8nr,doombybbr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yes but the problem with Korra and Asami is that they were still too afraid to show them kissing, same with Princess Bubblegum and Marceline of Adventure Time. As for being a popular show, Korra wasn't popular on TV which is why Nick took it off because the ratings were very low compared to other animated shows on Cartoon Network and Disney. Once Nick put the show online, it did better because it had a bigger international audience to pull to.  I was never one for Korra; if the show would have started out as an shoujo-ai from the beginning then yes, I would have watched it. However, but from what others are saying about the comic and how it will focus on Korra and Asami's relationship then it's best to believe that I will be getting it from Amazon.com  Personally, I think it's good that no one is talking about it; it means we finally reached an level of our society where different sexual orientations being represented on TV is no big deal. Finally, we can have shows with same sex characters and no one is running around with their heads cut off like a chicken saying ""OMG TWO LESBIANS!"" but now it's ""okay, two girls in love no big deal"".  But that's just me."

It also has some of the most serious relationship advice (Love isn't at first sight. Love takes work.) and relationship problems (How are we going to make this work?) I've ever seen. There are tones of being blamed for your mother not being alive, impending invasion from a force you have no chance against, characters with mental illness (OCD and low self esteem), intimate relationships and discovering your body, how to oppose being nearly taken advantage of and being manipulated by a person that sees you sexually, and projecting your issues unresolved from your lost lover onto your son.

For them, discovering that Garnet was a fusion of Ruby and Sapphire wasn't a question of what their relationship really was because it was obvious to anyone who sees homosexual relationships are non shocking, normal relationships that Ruby and Sapphire were a couple in love (which was confirmed not just in Keystone Motel but in that song Garnet sang in Jailbreak right after they refused.

I'm clueless at how to take things to the next level with a girl friend, I'm going on 30 and it's been 10 years since I formed a friendship beyond a superficial contact.  When I meet women it starts off strong and then erodes from there - whether that is because they slowly suspect/realize I'm trans or not, it's the pattern I've noticed.  I try not to get hung up on that but it might just be that I'm not viewed as girl friend material."

It took me a failed hetero marriage, countless pointless relationships and 29 years before I was brave enough to make the move I KNEW I had to make.   That's an awfully long time not giving myself a chance to be truly happy.    As for your boyfriend - thinking about ending it is worse than doing it (I've just this morning ended a relationship with a wonderful woman who just wasn't right). He deserves to know that you aren't where he thinks you are. And you deserve the right to be your own authentic self. Ultimately he is responsible for him and you are responsible for you and that's it. There are no tricks to doing shitty things - apart from grasping the nettle and just doing them.

actuallesbians,3e1ej0,Nix143,6,Tue Jul 21 11:05:32 2015 UTC,"When I was in your situation, I decided to evaluate whether I wanted a long term relationship with my boyfriend (now my ex). The possibility of being gay was a part of that decision, but it wasn't the only part. I found this helpful, because if I ever began to question my sexuality again, I still had plenty of reasons for ending my current relationship.  I would also recommend not telling your boyfriend that you're gay when you break up with him. You don't have to lie, but saying ""My feelings have changed, and I no longer want to be in a romantic relationship with you,"" is much easier to handle than, ""I realized that I am no longer sexually attracted to men."""
actuallesbians,3e1ej0,Pwn493,9,Tue Jul 21 13:43:20 2015 UTC,"I was in the same situation. I kept trying to ""cure"" myself and it just ended up with me miserable. My relationships never ended well unfortunately. :/ Before making any decisions, you said you are 90% sure. Try to be sure before throwing something away you might not want to lose. In the end, try to be very gentle. No man wants to hear that they ""turned"" their ex gay, but to be honest an explanation of your situation might be easiest for him to hear. Fluff his ego. Make sure he knows you weren't using him; you were just so blown away by how great of a guy he was that you thought he might have been the perfect guy you were looking for. Good luck!"
actuallesbians,3e1ej0,alygator666,10,Tue Jul 21 07:12:40 2015 UTC,"Try to be sure before throwing something away you might not want to lose.    Whether she's straight or or gay (or bi), this guy she's seeing is a human being with feelings who deserves respect and consideration. He is not a comfort item to make her feel good/safe, or a hedge against loneliness.   OP, I think you need to decide if you're really into your boyfriend or not, and if you're not, break up with him. Whether you are ""100 percent"" gay or not is really irrelevant to that.  If you decide he's not for you, and you want to get involved with a woman, then go for it."

I told a friend, he assured me I was not attracted to women. At age 16 I kissed a girl for the first time, we were friends and just wanted to try. I liked it. My mom found out and told me I was disgusting (she's my biggest supporter now). I think that was all I needed in order to regress. I dated only men, and I even married a man. I never really liked sex with men, so I actually thought I was just not interested in sex at all. After my divorce I entered an open relationship with a man, and I experimented more with women. I liked it. After that relationship ended I dated a girl for like two weeks (I wouldn't count it but it's my first so I feel I need to) and then got in a serious relationship with a woman. I realized I love having sex with women. I love and thrive on the deep emotional connection I feel with women.   I'm gay. It took 26/27 years to realize fully but I'm gay. I spent years identifying as straight and 4/5 years identifying as pansexual before coming to find myself.   It takes time. Follow your heart, you'll find yourself."
actuallesbians,3e1ej0,armeebarbee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"Was in this exact scenario. I have always been attracted to women. But as I grew up in an extremely religious house, I repressed it for years. (Looking back I always dated more feminine men). Unlike a lot of lesbians, I had no disgust from having sex with men. I just couldn't connect emotionally, thus making sex just..meh. But I digress.   I found a great guy. A guy that made me think all those hidden desires were just a phase. I was with him for 5 years. Around the third year I started getting unhappy. I talked with him. He said ""well maybe you're just bi. Let's watch porn together."" And despite wanting a woman, I loved him. I didn't want to hurt him. I thought I can make this work. I just became increasingly miserable. He realized I was pulling away and he became unhappy.   If you have any doubt in your relationship, I'd advise ending it. Just for both of your sakes. Then once you're out of that. Go sleep with a lady. While sex with men wasn't awful for me, sex with a woman is mind blowing. I walked away from my first  lady encounter with weak knees, a massive smile, and a feeling of belonging like I'd never felt."

And ha writing lesbian romance is hard enough when there's so much she and her but ha, its downright hilarious when I write about this woman and me. Sometimes I use a nickname for her and my full name or a different nickname for me. That's always an option.

Anyway my real hair is maybe 3-4in now and I was toying with the undercut idea. I wanted it longer though so it could still look more femme. I don't know. I'm not quite as curly as you (with a bit more length and some product and a diffuser I could be lol) so I was actually questioning how it would look. At my length it might not lay right yet if its not straightened (hey there's an irony here to straightening your queer cut, huh?!)  But ahh rambling aside, gotta say I love the uniqueness of it with curls. So I have no idea yet what I'll do with my own hair but thank you for giving me a twist on what I've been seeing and woohoo to you! Enjoy your badass queer hair!"
actuallesbians,3e0vxm,Lachatini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help!  And one of the keys to enjoying curly hair is to just not care if it's lying right.  I'm not sure you could do this exact style with your hair that short, but short wavy/curly hair is really cute, just in a kind of messy way.  Best of luck figuring something out, and thank you for the compliments!"

Sometimes friends don't realize who they're hurting, tell them and educate them. If they won't accept you, then avoid them. I know you're scared, but there are many accepting people nowadays...you just gotta find them. You don't need the constant negativity in your life. Be aggressive and take no shit!  I know what it's like to have disapproving parents. It's really frustrating and I don't ever intend on coming out to them. It's okay if you don't. Only if you feel ready or whatever.  Don't feel ashamed for what you feel. There's nothing wrong with loving a person. It's not disgusting - people only feel disgusted because they don't understand.  Don't worry about the label now, you like girls so accept that. self-acceptance is what you need. Good luck<3"
actuallesbians,3e11me,hazea,5,Tue Jul 21 05:38:47 2015 UTC,"hugs I know it sucks to be seen as disgusting by your culture, but unless you feel like coming out would put you in danger, I recommend coming out. Coming out allows you to remove the people who can't accept you for you from your life and find new people who can accept you, sexuality and all. You may lose some important people, but you may find some people surprising you."
actuallesbians,3e11me,nikkitgirl,3,Tue Jul 21 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"Gay guys, okaaaaay, but lesbians, ewww, thats disgusting!   That's odd, usually it's the other way around. Perhaps it's a bit ""too close for comfort"" for your straight friend, or else she's more into it than she wants to admit and is actively repressing.  You know, not everyone is good at something the first time they try it. You should make the gay club a regular, ongoing experience. Keep going until you start to feel comfortable there, and people start to recognize you. Chat with the waitstaff, ask people questions, become a regular."

I'm a big fan of respecting people's right to self-identify their sexuality no matter where it falls on the spectrum, so if a girl says she's straight that's a write-off for me, romantically speaking.   If a straight guy met you and invited you to breakfast, what would you want his intentions to be?"

actuallesbians,3e1t4m,Lluxx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"Well, there's nothing wrong with getting to know her better first! Especially if she looked after you while you were sick.

Maybe she's not straight and things can go from there, maybe she is but at least you found out soon."
actuallesbians,3e2nvu,lifewasraging,4,Tue Jul 21 14:18:00 2015 UTC,"How honest do you want me to be? :)  Here's a perspective most don't understand about relationships, they are there to challenge us and teach us lessons about ourselves. We are always in a relationship be it family, strangers, co-workers, lovers. The main relationship is the one with ourselves.   I miss my independence but I don't want to give this relationship up.   So you gave up a relationship with yourself for one outside of yourself. Is there a way to balance this out? If the answer is no, then the relationship is not making you a better person.  There's a saying that my wise elders would tell me and it was annoying but true. ""Where ever you go, there you are."" As you move along in life you are always with yourself. At the end of the day, can you look yourself in the mirror and say, ""I love myself""?  IMHO, I believe that's the power of relationships. They make you better not the latter. However, that's a choice I make.  Also, not a fan of the word ""blame"". It's a counterproductive word. Okay, you feel bad. That's just feedback to own up to the things you want and take some kind of action, i.e. talking about it on this subreddit to get a perspective. Well done.   I can relate to you very much. My first love/long term relationship was with my ex-bff. I loved my best friend for nearly a third of my life (late teens to late 20s. I'm in my late 30s) At some point we stopped growing together and the relationship did not bring out the best in me. It was scary but at some point I walked away never to have her in my life again. However, I love myself now. It was a wonderful experience but I'm a different person. And yet, I can't regret anything because to do so would devalue who I am now and I love myself. I am a sum total of my choices up till now.   I live with no regrets.  I am not saying you have to take any big action steps or walk away from your BFF permanently. You can still have a relationship with her. It might be different. However, if you continue to hold onto this relationship now and you keep feeling what you are feeling in time you will begin to resent her. I am talking from experience. You have to honor things you want. Relationships are 100% about you first. No getting around that. What you are feeling and experiencing is a projection of you. Again, is this relationship making you a better person? Is it helping you to grow for the better?  So the next course of action for you, it depends on what you choose for yourself. Choose from your heart and be sure you own it. It's your life. Continue to be kind and patient with yourself.  You'll be okay. It's brave of you to share. I think you're a wise person to be discerning all of this. Again, you'll be okay. Take it one day at a time.   Did this help?  Best of luck."

Whoooa. This part is extremely not true! The fact that a girl sometimes/also/mostly sleeps with men doesn't mean she's crazy about penetration. I spent the first twenty-odd years of my life mostly sleeping with men, and that was never what I was there for. I'm still a person who prefers oral sex, grinding, fingering to penetration... and frankly am relieved that with female partners, sex doesn't feel like it HAS to involve it unless I'm in the mood to want it.  Also, worrying bi girls fantasize about men while they're with you is just a different form of insecurity. They're with you; they're with you. I can find both men and woman appealing, but I don't think they're the same thing, nor do I wish them to be.  The dominance idea seems more likely to hold water, imo. And actually, most bi girls start out sleeping more with men simply because men are more aggressive and men trying to sleep with them will be more plentiful. So many of us, even when we're sexually experienced with men, still have hangups about how we compare to ""real"" lesbians. I've been dating women exclusively for years now and I STILL worry every time it takes a little longer to get a girl off that it's because of all those years of practice I missed.   But yes, bi girls more often pattern the behavior they expect from female partners on what they're more used to with men. So between that and worrying about inexperience, they probably are (suuuper broad strokes here) looking for more guidance/leadership from you."

actuallesbians,3dzqkm,rab0t,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"While I do kinda agree that might not be very ""nice"", I also think people have the ultimate authority on who they shag, no matter how out there or crazy their preferences are. It's not really a social problem like discrimination (it's not like it's a protected class you're refusing to hire; sleeping with someone isn't a right, it's a privilege), it's a personal preference.   I mean, by all means, you're free to judge other people by their preferences in terms on whether you wanna be friends or not but ultimately, people sleep with those they wanna sleep with and that's such a deeply personal thing I really think making any comments on the line of it being unfair are kinda missing the mark. It would be like a straight guy being upset a lesbian won't like him back because of something beyond his control. Not her problem."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,Cat_killed_curiosity,3,Tue Jul 21 08:49:56 2015 UTC,"No one is demanding anyone have sex with anyone, but not dating someone base on stereotypes about a class of people they belong to is completely different than not dating someone of a gender you simply don't find attractive.

Why is it offensive; a preference is a preference. People have the right to date whoever they want. No disclaimers need to be added onto that.   I understand some preferences might be weird or indicate something off putting and you're free to not associate with people if you don't like them for whatever reason, but it's still that person's preference.   It can't be offensive to not sleep with people you don't wanna sleep with (no matter why or who they are or how ""oppressed"" they are) because you don't owe sex to anyone. It would be like a bunch of people you know and don't like showed up for a party you made for your friends, and claimed it was offensive you didn't invite them since you discriminated based on who you like or not. Just doesn't hold up."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,Cat_killed_curiosity,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:29 2015 UTC,I agree that it's hurtful. It's not like hetero society as a whole is so super accepting and understanding of bisexuality that we couldn't use a little community support lol.
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,ThisIsntNarnia,6,Mon Jul 20 22:38:20 2015 UTC,"Another hypothesis is that I'm real subby, and typically attracted to dominant women.

Haha, trust me, we're not all submissive. ;)  And we're also not comparing you, I promise! Like other posters have said, most bi women are probably just as nervous about not being experienced as you are about not stacking up to previous male partners. Just relax and don't stress about it!"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,i_am_a_meatpopsicle,11,Mon Jul 20 21:50:07 2015 UTC,"Holy cats, you've got to stop making assumptions about your sex partners right off the bat! Unless you read minds, you can't  know ANY of this stuff without really talking to them and getting into the nitty-gritty of their sexual histories. How do you know that the bi girls you sleep with aren't into super submissive dudes? How do you know they've ever even been with a partner who has a cock? I can't speak to your experiences, obviously, but unless you're quizzing all the girls you sleep with before y'all do the do, it seems like you're giving yourself cold feet and disengaging from the sexual experience based on what you assume she's thinking.      I'm bisexual myself, and I want to be clear that I can only speak for myself, but at least as far as I'm concerned, none of that stuff goes through my head when I'm with a woman. If I'm with someone, I am very, very invested in whatever they're bringing to the table--err, bedroom?--whether that's fingers or a tongue or a clit or a cock (purchased or not). Maybe you need to talk to your partners a little more, and try to be less afraid that just because a woman has been with a man, she wants to be with a man even though she is sleeping with you?"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,rab0t,6,Mon Jul 20 21:16:30 2015 UTC,"For background, I love talking to new partners about sex. Usually there's a lot of talk about sexual histories on 1st - 3rd dates. I'm really comfortable talking about it, and I've considered bringing up this particular insecurity specifically before sleeping with new people. (I've shared it with some and not others, but it doesn't seem to make a big difference either way.)  Typically, though, by the time I sleep with someone, I know who they're currently sleeping with, what sorts of person they usually sleep with, etc. Both of the girls this week are in open relationships and both have two (pretty dominant) boyfriends each.   I hear what you're saying, and trust me I am ALL ABOUT lots of communication, but rapport is hard to gauge before you're actually there. I'm just trying to figure out why it seems like the rapport is always... off. :-/"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,winterkoninkje,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, I think —painting with a friggin spray washer here— bi women who're inexperienced with women do tend to default to more heteronormative, hence more submissive, roles. (Largely because I think everyone who's inexperienced —and doesn't yet identify strongly with a non-hetero label— tends to default toward heteronormative roles, because that's what society indoctrinates us with.)  On the other hand, I want to speak up as a poly person here. You say this week's partners already have some pretty dominant boyfriends, okay cool. Have you ever considered that maybe part of the reason they're seeking you out is because they're looking for someone who's not dominant, in order to fulfill whatever needs their current partners aren't/can't/won't? There are many reasons to be poly or open, but some of the big ones for a lot of folks are (1) to help lessen the emotional burden placed on any individual, and (2) to satisfy a variety of kinks/roles/etc without requiring them all of one person. Both of these often lead folks to date people who are rather different from each other.  Another thing to bear in mind is that anyone who's experienced in dating one gender but inexperienced in dating another, is going to find it awkward to date that new gender. It's like how dating was awkward way back in the first place, except now they have to relearn everything, and to top it off they're used to feeling competent so they have to deal with the awkwardness of not expecting the awkwardness. It's not just bi folks, it's also gay/lesbian folks who come out later in life, trans folks who start dating another gender after transitioning, and anyone else who follows that experienced-but-inexperienced pattern."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,rab0t,7,Tue Jul 21 05:32:03 2015 UTC,"Aaah, okay, I got it. Sorry that I went and made some pretty big assumptions about you! :) I still think it's worth looking into whether your own mental roadblocks are getting in the way of the rapport you have with these girls. Maybe think about whether you've ever had a similar experience with a lesbian, like, ever? Were there other differences in the ways that you treat or interact with lesbians vs. bi women that could have made things feel a bit off or difference? Were you in a different place in life prior to dating a bunch of bi women? I dunno. Maybe subconsciously you're not into them as much because you feel like you can't relate to a pretty important part of their lives (the whole dating-guys-with-dicks thing)? The other layer of this that I can't really speak to is the open relationship thing, since I'm hopelessly monogamous. Whatever your takeaway here, I hope you end up having some phenomenal sex with your upcoming partners!"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,rab0t,3,Mon Jul 20 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those are really good feedback questions. I know I'm much shyer to initiate with bi girls in general. I think the idea behind that is that when I was dating guys before I realized I was gay, it was really easy to assume that they wanted me to touch them. It made initiating first things super easy. With lesbians, it's pretty easy for me to make the same general assumption, and I'm pretty confident about it.   I think with bi girls, though, I'm more cautious that they're not attracted to me, and I'm scared I'll scare them away. (Maybe this is closer to how straight guys feel about hitting on women?) I'm not sure.   Thanks for your well-wishes about good sex! Fingers crossed. :-p"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,isSlowpokeReal,5,Mon Jul 20 21:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty safe bet that if you're at the point of initiating sex, or even just kissing and touching and she's reciprocating, you're good to go! Obviously communication is key and consent is sexy as hell, but you really don't have to be afraid of initiating stuff with a girl just cause she's bi."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,maydaysoup,7,Tue Jul 21 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would help you to remember that if she wanted to be with a man, she would certainly be with one. If a woman wants to sleep with a man, all she has to do is step outside and yell that. Someone will turn up. She picked you. She's naked, in bed with you because she wants something from you besides penis. It's easy to get dick; she had to work to get you.  I also think it would help if you let go of some of your assumptions about bisexuals. I happen to be a top with both men and women. I absolutely do not expect lesbians to top me and I actively discourage it.   I've never had strap on sex so I have no comment about that. But if you can't stop thinking about her comparing it to a real penis than maybe you should just leave it out next time. I like to think that my advantage over men is that I know how to use my mouth and fingers better."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,Gallifreyan_fez,4,Tue Jul 21 01:38:19 2015 UTC,"People's sexual preferences can be super diverse. I for one can enjoy dick plenty but aside from grinding, as I would grind with a vagina-haver, I don't really care for it being anywhere near my genitals. I've never had oral good enough to crave, but fingering is what I fantasize over and want when I feel like getting fucked. Otherwise, I like giving whether as a top or as a bottom.... Both are fun.  Yeah, and I don't fantasize about men when I'm banging a lady. I tend to fantasize about, you know, the lady. The one that's having sex with me at that exact moment. Nothing quite as sexy as the real thing to me."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,ahatmadeofshoes12,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I'll toss my hat in here.   Bi girls aren't exclusively looking for PIV sex, sometimes with or without boobs. Yes, getting fucked by a hot chick with a strap on is different than getting fucked by a guy with a dick, but that's kinda the point! It's not about better/worse, it's about different experiences.   Not all bi girls are submissive. It's a common misconception that boy/girl sex is automatically boy dominant/girl submissive. My sex life is very switchy and I enjoy both roles equally. Even when a penis is involved, I can absolutely be the boss. And I very much enjoy it.   I think your biggest hang up is your assumption that bi girls are comparing you to guys. Which would be silly of them to do. If I'm going to hook up with a girl, it's because I want girl sex. I don't want a girl to do her best to mimic what I could get from a man. If you're with a bi girl, and she's thinking in the back of her mind ""this would be way better with a bio penis/dominant guy"" then I have to question why that girl is pursuing sex with a woman at all.   Sex with girls is different than sex with guys. And that's a good thing! They don't have to be the same to be equally awesome. If a bi girl is sleeping with you, she's not looking for a male experience. Just relax and have fun :)"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,Gallifreyan_fez,3,Tue Jul 21 08:30:03 2015 UTC,"Not all bi girls are submissive. It's a common misconception that boy/girl sex is automatically boy dominant/girl submissive.   I hate this assumption as a dominant bi woman. I don't fit submissive roles at all. I've been with plenty of men and women and I've always defaulted to dominant. Submissive guys can sense this about me so they're always the ones drawn to me while dominant guys are completely uninterested.   I'm poly and my primary partner is male and he's definitely more submissive, sure we switch sometimes but our defaults are me as the dominant and him as the submissive. Not all guys are dominant and I actively avoid the ones that are."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,ahatmadeofshoes12,2,Tue Jul 21 11:47:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Most guys I've been with have been more on the submissive side, and I am only submissive for people I am EXTREMELY comfortable with. And even then, I still tend to prefer the other side."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,djcapelis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of submissive guys out there, I don't even think they're that rare, every guy I've ever been involved with was/is submissive. I'm sure I self select because I don't want anything to do with guys who adhere to traditional gender roles but even many conservative guys like to be dominated by a woman. I think they just don't feel comfortable talking about it, but it's definitely common."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,artichokess,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Oh hmm!  I've actually had a lot of really fun times with bi/pan women!  In fact if they're actively sleeping with men who are doing the kind of heteronormative dynamic I like to frame things as a chance to break out of that and do something different.  Whether it's be more dominant or switch up activities or whatever can be a lot of fun for everyone involved.  Sometimes it actually works out better if they're still seeing someone else who is fulfilling other things they like, because then we can have fun focusing on other stuff I like more anyway!  (That said no queer woman is particularly alike, all of the bi women I've slept with have had as wide a range of preferences for what they want to do in bed and what we settle on as women of other orientations.)"
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,AllisonLovesYou,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:32 2015 UTC,"i'm going to try to give a general perspective then give my personal view.  some bi girls see sex with guys or with girls as two different experiences, and might miss one after a while. for other bi girls, the difference between the bond and satisfaction with each individual partner is much bigger than the difference between men and women in bed, so the guy/girl divide isn't even relevant.   but let's go with the first scenario for fun, and look at what a (cis) guy can offer in bed that a girl can't: -a live dick -more cum  so, for a girl that's really into blow jobs or getting cummed on or being thrown around in bed like a feather, a guy might have something to offer that a girl doesn't.  those women are certainly out there, but i don't think that's not what makes the sexual experience valuable to most women. i think that most of us just want amazing foreplay and amazing orgasms. a girl can strap on a dick and have all the same positions that a guy can, so really, the playing field is even.  now let's talk about me personally. i like penetration, but it's usually foreplay for me. when i have sex with guys, 90% of the time i either cum via the clit while being penetrated or the have him finger me afterwards. there's really nothing a guy can offer me that a girl can't, except a scruffy face, but there are things that girls can do that guys can't: tribbing, mainly. omg how i love tribbing. and four boobs smooshed together. fantastic. also, girls, in my experience, have been way better kissers on average than guys, but i digress.   that being said, i'm pretty sure that if i was in a LTR with a girl, i would start to miss the male body a bit. i haven't been with a girl in two months and i'm definitely craving the female body. however, i'm also pretty sure that this is something i'd be willing to deal with if the relationship was worth it, so it's not very consequential."
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,ahatmadeofshoes12,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:53 2015 UTC,I love being bisexual. I'm glad you reminded me of this!
actuallesbians,3dzqkm,kcidothtead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:39 2015 UTC,"I'm bi, polyamorous, and dominant and while my primary partner happens to be male all of the other partners I've had in the last three years have been women and the vast majority of them have been bi (bi poly women seen more common then lesbian poly women). You're making a lot of assumptions that aren't realistic at all for a lot of us bi women.   I don't have sex with men for dominance. I prefer to be the dominant partner regardless of my partner's gender. Every guy I've ever dated has been more submissive than I am and my primary definitely is. While I like to switch occasionally I don't want my partners dominant, I much prefer to top.   Secondly, penetration isn't that important and it's not the primary reason I have sex with men or women. While there is something neat about penetrative sex being able to get my partner off its far from the most important thing to me. Actually one of the reasons I've basically stopped dating men besides my primary is because a lot of men think penetration is the most important thing and only focus on that too the exclusion of oral and fingers, it's just how they've been socially conditioned. My male partner isn't this way at all but my male exes were and it's pretty much why I'm content to only pursue women, a lot of guys' social programming makes them shit in bed. The best partners of any gender are creative, giving and use a variety of methods to get me off, actually women tend to on average be better at this then men.   Besides, I'm a top, if anyone is going to be rocking the strap on its likely me. I've never felt insecure about my abilities to use it, I know I'll never be as good at it as my male partner (I have no feeling or proprioception through my silicone cock so it's harder to use) but who cares, that's a tiny piece of the puzzle and I know I'm great with my lips, tongue and fingers. Even when I've fucked my male partner with a strap on (pegging) he had no complaints and managed a prostate orgasm despite the fact that I was awkward at first because I'm not used to having a cock and I don't have feeling in it. All that matters is that you and your partner are getting what you guys both want out of the interaction.   When I'm with someone no matter their gender the only person I'm thinking of is that person."

actuallesbians,3dy1lq,WombatTaco,2,Mon Jul 20 19:04:42 2015 UTC,I was using it at the end of last year and I thought it was good. I don't know if it is this app you had issues with but you connect to it with your Facebook account so they can confirm your gender (if I remember correctly) and maybe I'm just being naive but I don't feel like guys would go to the effort of making a fake Facebook to use a dating app. The only issues I ever had with it were quite a few inactive accounts in my area and issues with the app itself.
actuallesbians,3dy1lq,nikkitgirl,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"Her is built for (transwomen included) and by women. I personally am not too keen on their dating section, prolly bc I get the same 20 ppl. I have heard of ppl finding dates and the like with better luck.   What I DO like about this app is their feed. They have events listed that you can say you're attending (and for those too shy to ""like"" or message a gal, you can see which events your crush is attending), blog posts related to pretty much anything LGBTQ related (more for lesbians than gay men, obviously), which you can comment, share, like, etc.   It's def different than other ""dating"" apps because there is more of a community feel to it. Admittedly as a traveller I would like to be able to have it know which city I'm at and update the feed of events accordingly so if I'm in NYC I can check out those events vs my own city (SF).

However, don't give any money to beggars on the train, this is a scam, avoid talking to them and watch out your belongings.

actuallesbians,3dwehy,AnnieB25,5,Mon Jul 20 13:46:27 2015 UTC,"LOL!  People think my sister-in-law is my partner too.  I've been friends with her since my senior year in high school (18 years ago, yikes) so we're very close.  When we're out shopping together it's interesting to see how salespeople relate to us.  One time we were continually skipped over in line while trying to pay at a cosmetics counter.  Once we were asked what kind of candles we burn ""at our home.""  And once at Bath and Body Works an associate made a hilarious face after my SIL and I had been in there shopping for several minutes and my brother walked in and gave my SIL a hug and kiss."
actuallesbians,3dwehy,cintelik,6,Mon Jul 20 16:50:36 2015 UTC,Why do people do this?? I was at a party kissing my girlfriend and someone clearly looking at us asked if we were best friends. Hilarious.
actuallesbians,3dwehy,bathtubsharks,6,Mon Jul 20 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Oh man, my fiancée and I get asked if we are sisters all the time!   Yesterday we were at the store and the cashier asked us what we were doing with the things we were buying and we said that we are making boxes for our bridesmaids. She was like ""oh! Are you mother and daughter?""  -_-   We are only 6 months apart in age. We looked at her like, ""really?"""

""This is Jon, we're on the same bowling league.  Jon, this is my girlfriend Stephanie""  Etc are very common."

actuallesbians,3e0nhk,Alexis76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:54 2015 UTC,"I'm from Tampa. Right now I'm on the east coast of the state doing a clinical rotation for grad school but I should be back full time in a few weeks. The Tampa Bay Area is a pretty great place to be queer. St. Pete Pride is the biggest pride festival in the state and there's a pretty big kink scene in Tampa as well. Saturday night at the Honey Pot in Ybor is lesbian night and it's a really good time.   I'm definitely looking for more queer friends, I had a big community in college but since going to grad school is been harder to find community since most of it is geared towards college students 18-22.  For the 20 somethings past undergrad who are either working or in grad school there are fewer communities and it's hard to fit with the undergrads since most of them are still in their baby gay/queer phase."

Gotten that break up text, no closure, no nothing, just one night she's there, promising forever with me, the next morning, says she's done and we are over. It took my whole world away back then. Couldn't see it through the pain, but the very basic things I had were still there. I have scars from it all, and a few trust issues, but like someone else here said, time heals more than you think. You're going to be alright. If you ever need somebody to vent to, I'm here to listen."

actuallesbians,3dy9rv,caikroll,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:58 2015 UTC,"As one who has survived a dreadful break-up, not completely similar to yours but still devastating, I just want to tell you that you can get through this, and you will.  Don't try to replace her. Just work on your healing. You're the same age I was.....you're young. Plenty of time later to find a new love. Go out and do things with friends, find a new engrossing hobby, get involved with a spiritual group if you're so inclined. Take lovely warm baths, write in your journal. All those healing things, do them. Over time, they work and you will heal."
actuallesbians,3dy9rv,izzgo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"I also am really sorry this happened. :(  When I went through a major breakup, friends told me to give myself some time to just be by myself, and at the time I was like WTF, but I really get it now, years after the fact. In the long run, it definitely helps to get a little space outside of being in a relationship and to try and focus on things you enjoy doing (for me it was making art), hanging out with good friends, etc. Well, it helps in the short-term, too, but I think it can be harder to see it.  It also is gonna be hard to meet anyone new when you are still working through your feelings for her. My advice would be to give yourself some time--and while you do that, do anything you can do to take care of yourself, whether that means treating yourself to your favorite cookies or taking a walk every day."

actuallesbians,3dzh17,wajtog,3,Mon Jul 20 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"/r/lesbianfashionadvice is where you want to be.   I'm definitely not the best person to answer this question, in terms of men's clothing, but I will throw in my two cents with regards to women's clothing in case it helps, since I tend to dress somewhere on a spectrum between femme and androgynous. Buying men's clothing works really great for a lot of people, but it doesn't work for me. Mainly because the bust is a problem even in women's shirts, and I'm also kind of short and small-ish. If men's clothing often fits weird on you, hopefully this helps.   In a business casual setting, I'd probably start with a base of a button down with tapered leg pants, like this, but ignore the shirt. It's not a strictly masculine style, but I feel like the alternative is to have wide leg or straight leg pants which seem fairly feminine to me. Here's photographic evidence that these pants WERK. I've never had them restrict my movement in any way.   A blue shirt with black pants and some kind of oxford would probably be a solid look. You can always add on a jacket or v-neck sweater or bow-tie/tie if you like. In certain cases, you could even get away interesting patterns on your shirt if it's in a dark/muted color.   In terms of comfort, you could get softer cotton/linen shirts which are not as crisp sometimes, but are very comfortable."

I can think of probably 5-10 lesbian identified women of all ages that have said similar things to my partner. Unfortunately straight people don't have a monopoly on being assholes.  I would also say that your friends are assholes. If they aren't standing up for you, your partner, and your non-binary friend, they are being assholes. And they may need that explained to them. I had to realize recently that I was being an asshole by not saying anything when these things happen to my partner. And unfortunately it will mean a lot more to the asshole woman when a ""real lesbian"" (as she sees it) tells her the fuck off. And if they don't seem to care, you should part ways with them.

I cannot fathom any other explanation for why she would make such an assumption about your sexuality and intentionally misgender someone.  I would suggest hanging out with your group of friends, but not talking to B. If B engages with you, give monosyllabic and polite answers. Make conversations with her awkward and stilted; she will stop talking with you.  If B says something offensive to you or misgenders your friend, correct her, or say, ""Wow. That's offensive"" and just let it sit there.  If your mutual friends want you to talk to B or be her friend or whatever, just say she isn't your favorite person, but you have no problem with your friends hanging with her.

actuallesbians,3dwt8l,thatsjustridiculous,9,Mon Jul 20 09:41:51 2015 UTC,"My take on this situation is that B has obviously had her heart broken by way to many beautiful women who ended up being straight, and she is bitter as hell about not only the fact that two women of that same stature of beauty found each other,  but that she couldn't find a girl she deems beautiful to commit to her.  She is so bitter about it that she is sensitive about it, and refuses to believe that two women so pretty would be into each other for any purpose other than attracting a man.  Perhaps she has unwarranted feelings of grandeur."

She'll have to agree--and she'll have to do some research immediately afterward. You might send her this link http://www.ingriddruslan.com/lesbian-faqs/ to help her along.

Before I went on medication, I would periodically reach out to my friends on Facebook and ask them if I could buy them lunch or coffee. Just having someone else to talk to what a huge help.  I also have a few close friends who deal with depression, and I would talk to them. People who have dealt with depression are less likely to freak out when you tell them you spent Thursday night crying under a blanket.   I also would watch Bee and Puppycat again and again. It was cheerful and happy, and it would make me feel the tiniest amount of joy, so I watched it everyday for months. I also made a playlist on youtube of stuff to make me happy, and I'd listen to it for hours.  I hope these suggestions help you make it to August."

My lady and I talk a lot, we don't hold anything back, even if it gets awkward/shameful/painful/whatever. Yeah we feel like shit for a while but we end up feeling freed of so many burdens.   It's been very hard, I can assure you. The ups and downs are exhausting for both, and we've both wanted to throw in the towel a couple of times. But love trumps all, and it's love and a loooot of trust that makes us hang in there. And it is so worth it, especially if you feel like this person is the one you want to spend your life with.  Have faith that just like you have bad days, and they're really bad, you're gonna have good days, and they're gonna be fantastic.

actuallesbians,3dy51u,KetordinaryDay,2,Tue Jul 21 09:41:39 2015 UTC,"Hi areeoddnuh-  I used to suffer really bad anxiety and depression-  someone else recently mentioned being depressed so I'll just copy paste what I wrote  ""I used to suffer from it but managed to fully recover by getting involved in exercise, meditation, self improvement (ex-learning a new language), and participating in charity on a regular basis (I donate blood regularly and show up to many posted community events that need volunteers).""  I managed to recover from very serious mental problems with a very strong determination to control my negative emotions and channel all of the strong feelings of anxiety into feeling productive by helping friends out (I'm the friend that will help you move), doing charity, and scheduling enjoyable things to do like walks, museums, shows and a daily meditation practice.   I was very self disciplined and consistent in doing all of the activities and still am. The thing with anxiety is that it is a very high energy state.  I found that if I channeled that energy into things that I can control in life rather then obsessing about everything bad that can happen or being hard on myself this helped me more then any medication or therapy.  My point is I was proactive as hell- determined as hell, and was very structured and disciplined about climbing out of the hole I was in. That's just what worked for me and my depression/anxiety was severe and I have managed to fully recover.   Bottom line- ENGAGE in life as much as possible however that looks for you.  Also my partner stood by me for years through all of this.  She's amazing."

It is people with all types of mental illnesses sharing their stories.  http://mentalpod.com/  Its a fantastic show that has helped me immensely.

It doesn't affect my interactions with people (or if it does, no one has ever said anything about it), but it does affect my moods when I'm alone, throughout the day, or after a triggering event. The thing for me is I personally believe it's the isolation that gets to me most. As long as I have some meaningful human interaction, I'm alright. So that's what helps me. Sadly I can't always get it and sometimes shit happens and I crash. So I don't know."
actuallesbians,3dy51u,numl0ck1s0n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"Fantastic you are on here. I suffered with depression / anxiety and a few other annoying things throughout my teens until about 30. I'm 36. Luckily I was never on medications. Or for some odd reason that was never an option for me but I did  have a very bipolar lifestyle where I would go go go throughout the day then crash at home and sleep for 15 hours a day. Very crazy back then.  My depression took a toll on me and I was in very toxic relationship back in my 20's. It was when I turned 26 that my life hit rock bottom and it was the impact the woke me up and I began to change myself for the better.  There are ways of healing. It is about learning to believe in yourself. Continue to surround yourself with better people. This takes times.  How I did it - It's first about choice. Taking responsibility for your life. I never gave up believing I could get better and happier.  I did everything under the sun from reading self help books, meditations I found through the internet, holistic coaching, hypnosis, therapy, working out etc. Also, I looked for mentors or people who could teach me how to be happy.   Who I am now - I am a bit of average athlete that goes to the gym, does yoga, weight lifting, my acne cleared up a few years ago. I eat healthy (a paleo type lifestyle) and I've been doing my own meditation for about 7 years now. I have a teacher in Hawaii. It's what works for me.  I know you don't have money to do all these things. Really it's not about how much money I spent (at times wasted.) The major theme: I kept trying and focused on wanting to find a better way at being happy. In the course of 10 years learning this stuff, what I discovered is that I developed better habits.   To be mentally healthy, it's similar to how we are taught to be physically healthy. You do things on a daily basis like exercise to strengthen muscles.  This goes with your mental disposition. Do little things for yourself every day to make yourself just a bit happier. Over time you develop a mental muscle and resources that you can access that if you have a bad day, those resources will help you keep grounded.  I still have bad days but I don't go into a deep depression like I used to. We are always allowed to have bad days. That's life.  I know it is not one particular thing that helped me to get better. What I finally realized is happiness is something I have to work out everyday. Like if I want to maintain a healthy body, I don't eat a healthy meal once a month. I eat healthy 97% of the time. ;)  I know it's tough for you right now. Mental illness is something I can relate to at a very deep level. Very.  It can get better. It does get better. Just take it one day at a time. Remember to breathe and slow down. The most important thing I've learned and it's a crazy concept, be forgiving of yourself first. Stop beating yourself for past mistakes and learn lessons and move on.   Does this help?  Best of luck."

I'm post-op, so it's not like it changes anything for them. I've always been a woman so I don't see what I have to ""feel comfortable to talk about it"".   Edit : However, I never lie.

I am under the mindset that it is a minor detail and this very mindset is what puts my partners at ease when they do not know anything about trans. Coming around and saying it as if it was this big thing could scare off someone who knowns nothing about trans. From first hand experience, being casual about it is the best for everyone involved."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,InfectedBlood,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"But disclosing that you are cis is like disclosing that you have two arms. I mean, that is the norm, so it's quite obvious that you don't need to make such a disclosure if you are cis. I understand that you need to defend your identity, but you have to expect that the vast majority of people will assume that and they will have to process a contrary information."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,6,Mon Jul 20 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"I am not defending my identity. What would I defend it against? If they assume I am cis, then it is their problem for assuming, not mine for not saying. It's not like this piece of information would affect their life. The only thing that affects them is my like of periods, and that's almost more of a pro than a con.  Honestly, I never had a girl being offended by my method. A lot of girls here theorize about how they would react, but when you are living the situation for real (ie : when it is the person you love for real), you somehow see things differently. In fact, I asked them questions about how they would have reacted if I would have told them earlier and two of them said they probably would have been scared and wouldn't have continued... It's only because they got to know me before knowing that I was trans that they were able to see that it didn't change anything."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,InfectedBlood,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"I would assume you have to defend your identity when people don't see you as a woman.

actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"Of course. I've talked with people who have no ideas about me and they have said the damnest things, like this girl I was on a date with. We had a common friend who was dating a transwoman and we ended up talking about them and she said ""I have nothing against her, but I need a real woman""... Excuse me? You didn't find the right person to say that! That's like someone who doesn't know you are gay saying some homophobic bullshit. Sadly, the only way to be seen as a woman by everyone is by identifying as a woman. If I was publicly trans, a lot of people would see me as ""less"".  I wouldn't say I lucked out. I don't date just anyone, obviously. If I have sex with someone, I always know them enough to know that they are open minded. Also as I said, when you love the other person, you don't see things the same way. I am fairly certain that if I was openly trans, I wouldn't have as much ""luck"". I do live in a very liberal area, though. If I lived in a very conservative area, things my be different, but this applies to any LGBT people."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,redditicantquitu,15,Tue Jul 21 13:27:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind but I've been dating a trans woman since January, who I knew was trans before we'd even met in person (she contacted me via OKCupid and was open about it on her profile). Surgery status is a non issue for me as well.  Unfortunately there are a lot of women out there for whom it would be a problem - if you're worried about it, it may be best to tell her sooner than later so you can work on moving on sooner than later if she has a problem with it."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Lesbian_Drummer,13,Mon Jul 20 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"When I was younger, I admit, I would have been very confused and needed to educate myself a LOT.  I wouldn't have turned myself away, probably, but I would've had a lot of questions, and I admit I also would've been weirded out by the unfamiliar genitalia (assuming we're talking about a non-op/pre-op woman, of course).    Now that I'm older and have already done all the educating myself?  No issues whatsoever.  The genital situation would be the same - if a woman was non-op or pre-op I would have to learn a few things and gain some level of comfort - but other than that I truly feel there would be zero issues for me.  This is academic, however, as I'm monogamously married.  But should I ever find myself in the situation to date again (and I'm hoping very hard that I never do), my potential partner being trans* would be so very far from a deal breaker.  edit: to add about timing.  I think three weeks is fine.  You're still figuring each other out.  And when you're dealing, on top of that, with the fact that you also want to know if it's safe to tell this woman about this... I think, given the timeline and the fact you guys haven't moved super quickly, you're fine if you tell her soon.  But tell her soon.  That way you can move on if she turns out to be a horrible person about it."

It's going to come up in a month at the 4 month mark anyways, that's totally enough time.  Ofc if she was pre-op I'd like to know so we can talk about what she's comfortable with sexually. Post-op I wouldn't care when because that's her business and personal medical history which I have no business knowing about.  Whenever she's comfortable. Ofc it'd probably come up living together (so... when do we sync up our periods?) etc.  The whole thing of 'cheating' or 'lying' connected with trans ppl is a fucked up concept anyways; it implies you aren't who you say you are. You ARE who you say you are. You haven't lied to her at all"

To me, I only talk about it to women who identify themselves as cis. I personally identify myself as just a lesbian woman and when I talk to someone else who identify as just a woman, then I assume that they don't care about that detail just like I don't care about it for them. If they do openly say that they are cis (it happened on OK Cupid), I just say that I'm trans. That's kinda like when you meet a new person and they ask you your name. It's normally good practice for them to give out their name after. It's kinda awkward sometimes when they don't."

Once we got to a point were sex was involved (assuming she hadn't brought it up beforehand),  I'd ask what type of protection is needed.   Personally I don't feel like it's any of my business, until we have sex, and only because I'd like to know what type of protection to make sure we have."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,vilpachu,35,Mon Jul 20 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"Mostly replying because I want to tell you: You're not a fraud.  It does sound like it'd probably be a good idea to bring it up soonish (in large part because you're worried about it).  Perhaps try to bring it up in a low-pressure situation? (Like, maybe not bring it up right before having sex for the first time for example).  That way if she has questions or wants to think about it, she'll feel like she has time to.   (I'm not a lesbian (queer lady with a slight preference for ladies) so my input to your original question may not be particularly valuable, but I wouldn't care at all.  I also wouldn't mind the time-frame.)"

No, because i'm aware i can't even begin to imagine how hard it is to ""confess"", and how hard must have been life before transition, and i'm not self centered enough to go ballistic and say i'm offended /hurt /disappointed because i deserve to know, i don't.  That said, finding it out might be a deal breaker if i'm honest. Penis is just a no go for me, and sex is an important part of my life.  Being even furtherly brutally honest, even with no penis might be a deal breaker, if i'm looking for just a semi casual thing and not the - omg i found the love of my life thing - because i'm kind of a horrible person and i might not want to take on the baggage, emotional, political, social, and so on that i imagine comes with being transgender.

A few months later at an event with my co-workers, she made comments out loud that implied I had trans history. Nobody at my office knows. I'm stealth. That's not okay. Luckily nobody seems to have heard. I find out later that she also told her family and friends, some of whom I've met.  That's why I hate disclosing. So make sure she knows what is up."

actuallesbians,3dwn2e,pseudolus,5,Mon Jul 20 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'm bi/pan so it wouldn't matter to me, as long as the person wasn't being personally deceptive. I feel that is a sensitive issue and the person may have wanted to wait until they were comfortable to reveal it. It may change my opinion based on if I felt they weren't upfront about it depending on what I felt their motivation was in hiding it, or not being comfortable. I feel that that's up to each person to decide how they feel about it though, and to say if they were comfortable or not to continue the relationship, just like with revealing any personal information that may be a dealbreaker."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,ahatmadeofshoes12,5,Mon Jul 20 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"I would hope not. But I've never been in that situation, so the reality of human frailty is theoretical.   If you fear an adverse reaction, you should talk to her right away. Get that part behind you and move on."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Silaryia,5,Mon Jul 20 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"3 weeks is a very short time, especially since apparently you've only been texting. I wouldn't care, but I can't tell you how this girl will feel, obviously. You should probably tell her soon. I mean, if you plan to continue the relationship, sooner or later she'll know, so might as well make it sooner. If she has a problem with it, then clearly you guys aren't compatible and waiting longer to tell her wouldn't change that. Hope everything goes alright."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,GQuestioningThrowAwy,4,Mon Jul 20 16:13:27 2015 UTC,"For me, personally, I don't think I'd feel betrayed or lied to or anything of that nature. I can totally understand that it would be difficult to express, difficult to bring up, difficult to own up. I wouldn't begrudge you taking the time to say it when and how you wanted to. I wouldn't freak out and I don't think I'd react negatively. I think, if your girl does, then that isn't the right girl for you anyway."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,gnurdette,5,Mon Jul 20 04:30:24 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with it, three weeks isn't that much time. Although if I liked someone and knew they were Trans from the get go that wouldn't bother me either. Sexy is sexy, I don't care if someone was assigned a different sex at birth, it really only matters where they are now. Then again I'm also bi so I'm more flexible with gender anyway and I wouldn't really care if genital status was congruent with how the person identifies or not.   I would want my partner to tell me fairly early on, I would just hope she felt she could tryst me enough to share. I make it well known that I am a trans ally so I'd hope she would see that and feel safe. Although I recognize it's hard for people to come out initially so I definitely wouldn't fault someone for not being 100% up front."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,minaivey,4,Mon Jul 20 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't feel cheated, especially at three weeks. You are putting yourself into a potentially dangerous situation (such as losing your job) by outing yourself as transgender, so it makes sense that there needs to be some level of caution. As for the transgender bit: if they care, they aren't good enough for you. Seriously.  And if any other lady here gets butthurt over my comment, I recommend you doing some self-reflection on why dating a post-op trans person is an issue."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,IndorilMiara,3,Mon Jul 20 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe, cuz I'm trans too, and ik how hard it is to come out, but I'd be hurt if someone who I cared about hid something like that from me. Idk, it'd make me feel like I wasn't trustworthy and they were trying to hide it from me."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,superpowder,6,Mon Jul 20 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Plot twist: she's trans herself.  OK, I just made that up, but honestly, you don't know, right?  And it would explain why she sells herself short...  Anyway, right, telling her is scary, but what are your other options?  The only one I can think of is to just assume that she'll dump you for being trans, and thus to preemptively dump her first without ever letting her know why.  You aren't considering that, are you?"
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,she_said_what_now2,3,Mon Jul 20 08:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that she (and most people) would react the way that I would- if a girl I was talking to told me she was transgender, that wouldn't diminish my feelings or respect for her at all. You are a woman, and I hope that she will see that and treat you with the compassion and the consideration you deserve.   I do think that you should tell her soon, in person, because texting can be challenging when talking about something personal. Tell her the truth, and go from there. I hope it all works out!"
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,violetmemphisblue,4,Mon Jul 20 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"If she thinks less of you because you're trans, then you deserve better anyway."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,undefiniert,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't, personally. I honestly wouldn't give a fuck after three weeks but that's just me.   However,  I have found many gay women seem to have difficulty accepting transwomen from my experience (not trans, just have a lot of opinionated lesbian friends). It's unfortunate, but what can you do? I'd say just be careful and don't get in too deep/serious without telling her first. Honesty is everything."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,ayanni07,4,Mon Jul 20 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"You can speculate about it and worry, but the the truth is, you won't know how she's going to react until you allow her to react. If you care about her and she's important, don't wait until she develops deeper feelings for you and then tell her; that would be particularly unkind. You know she could react negatively and it will only hurt you both more if you wait. The timing is up to you, of course, but you're already calling her the girl of your dreams. If your connection to her is that great, chances are, she's thinking the same thing about you. You're not misleading her; you're just as female pre-op as post op. But you're hiding a relevant truth and obfuscating the truth is the same as lying. You should tell her."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,3,Mon Jul 20 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person. If it were someone I just absolutely clicked with and was head over heels for, I'd probably be pretty okay. If it was someone I was having questions or doubts about, it might push me away...and I don't mean to be like ""you must share your absolute innermost secrets right away"" but I think it's one of those things that needs to be shared pretty early on in a relationship, because it is a big deal for some people. If you wait months to bring it up, it's only increasing the likelihood that she'll feel lied to or betrayed, even if she's otherwise okay with it. (I would consider information like this to be on the same level as like having a serious STD or kids or something--it's a huge major thing that, for better or worse, absolutely impacts both people in the relationship and should be dealt with early on)."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Alyssa_B,4,Mon Jul 20 04:02:24 2015 UTC,"Not planning on taking months to tell her. I'll probably mention it after the 3rd or 4th date. I'll be leaving in a month for surgery and I'll be missing for some time, so I'll definitely be telling her if we haven't stopped seeing each other yet."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,thatsjustridiculous,2,Mon Jul 20 04:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'd personally tell her before you're leaving so she knows why you're gone for a while. Gives her time to think about it if it does have some kind of impact and also doesn't let her wonder why you've left. Just my two cents, do what you think fits to the situation. Edit: I should start reading comments more carefully. You intend on doing that anyway, right?"
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,massaverokla,4,Mon Jul 20 16:54:58 2015 UTC,I would 100% feel betrayed. You should be upfront with it
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,InfectedBlood,3,Mon Jul 20 03:59:24 2015 UTC,Can I ask you why?
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nesswithanL,4,Mon Jul 20 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"We've not even gotten very far though. I mean we haven't even kissed yet, just held hands."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,aawillma,4,Mon Jul 20 04:24:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, as long as you don't mind being upfront with your views on trans women on a first date with anyone. That's fair, isn't it? I mean, if the expectation is being set that all trans women should share their medical history with you in the very beginning and on your timeline, I think it's the least you could do.  ""Hi, I'm ayanni07. Just wanted to get this out up front, but I dont believe trans women should have the right to disclose on their terms with me, without me feeling cheated and betrayed. So if you're a trans woman, you really need to tell me now, cause its gonna be a problem for me""  You can do that, can't you? On every date? It's not a problem to share such a personal thing when you have no idea how the person might react, right?"
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,merplethemerper,2,Tue Jul 21 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"You haven't kissed or anything yet, Just held hands.  And you haven't lied...if you say you are a woman, than you are a god damned woman.  you get an operation in a month, it sounds like it has been a nice slow courting process anyway.  I guess I could see where some might take it hard, but if she is already attracted to you like she seems, and has the same feelings for you that you do for her, than she will understand completely.  You don't get to choose what body you are born with.  Your honesty will win out either way!  Don't worry so much.  Anyone is worth the time is going to be loving and understanding about this, and they aren't going to make you feel like a fraud three weeks into a relationship.  Luckily I find women to be the more compassionate and understanding sex.  If she isn't into it, she's not the right one, girl.  I'd talk to her about it soon, maybe bridge the conversation by explaining about you parents (ie: do you remember when you asked me about my parents and having to leave home?  And how I told you it was complicated?  I want to elaborate on that and have a conversation about it because I respect you and I want to be upfront with you about not only who I am, but who I used to be.""  Something like that.  It wouldn't bother me one bit.  She might be put off by the idea of a penis, but depending on the gal, I would think that explaining that that will be a non issue in a month would probably work in your favor.  I'm sure you will be well worth the wait for her, and I hope it works out.  Take a deep breath, collect your thoughts, and remember that you are honest, and your heart is in the right place.  I think this will work out for you, and i will be thinking of you and sending good energy your way this week."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,3,Mon Jul 20 06:40:21 2015 UTC,First off she's not being cheated because you are a woman. And she's obviously into woman and into you!  So just let her know. She's going to find out sooner or later.  If she's not into you sexually- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. You did nothing wrong. Everyone has their sexual preference. I've had crushes on plenty of people and then realized we weren't sexually compatible. It happens all the time regardless of gender or orientation.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,2,Mon Jul 20 09:34:14 2015 UTC,"I would be glad she'd told me, as it would spare me and her a lot of grief, because I couldn't continue our relationship. Not telling soon would be truly an awful idea."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:13 2015 UTC,wouldn't bother me. hope it doesn't bother her when you tell her. good luck.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:02:43 2015 UTC,"It saddens me how much anxiety and insecurity lesbian transladies have about dating and feeling like frauds. That tells me that there a lot of us cis lesbians that have been jerks to you, I'm sorry you feel that way.   That said, your timing sounds perfect. When things are just about to get really serious, it's time to open up about things like this. Stance on marriage and kids, religion, potentially surprising genitalia. All in the same boat.  To be honest the only thing that would bother me about dating a transwoman would be if my conservative mom and stepdad found out they would question the sincerity of my sexuality and tell me to date a real man and blah blah. Not a big deal in the scheme of things."

actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:36 2015 UTC,I would feel cheated if someone lied about anything for 3 weeks.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Thelastunicorn1,7,Mon Jul 20 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"Well I've never really lied to her about anything. We've talked about our lives and there'll be sometimes when I simply just respond to her that ""it's complicated"". So she definitely knows something is up but I'm not comfortable with sharing yet.  Eg. ""Why did your parents kick you out for? Is it because you're a lesbian?""  ""Umm not quite. It's complicated."""
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,4,Mon Jul 20 04:20:47 2015 UTC,"Well to add on the other poster, that is kinda not cool. It is withdrawing of information. Not telling her that you are trans is not lying, but not answering questions clearly is not very nice. Of course, she understands that you are not ready to talk about it, but you make her doubt and imagine things. Please, try to avoid doing this in the future. It would make me uneasy."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,5,Mon Jul 20 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"Put it this way. You just met a girl 3 weeks ago and she wants to know every little detail about your life, eg. your salary. You don't feel comfortable discussing it with someone you don't know that well yet. Is it also ""not cool"" because you're withdrawing information?  I mean for fucks sake. We've only known each other for 3 weeks. We've gone out twice. We've not even kissed yet. We are not partners. We are not in a relationship, and we most certainly aren't thinking about marriage. It took months to over a year before my friends earned my trust. Why should anyone be expected to divulge information that they are clearly not comfortable sharing with someone whom they've known for less than a month?  If we were in a steady relationship then yeah, of course I should tell my partner. But at this point we're just at the ""I think I like you; I think I like you too"" stage."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Alyssa_B,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"Hey hey, I'm trans and I don't tell it to my partners. I usually take a month or two of dating for the conversation to come naturally. I know exactly how it feels to be in your situation. You misunderstood my comment. My comment not about you not divulging the information but more about your answer of ""it's complicated"". If the girl who I like would tell me this, I would know that there is something that she is not ready to tell me yet. I would probably think of a lot of scenarios in my heard, which would make me uneasy. Of course, I would totally understand their point of view and would not push for an answer, but still, I wouldn't want them them to make all kinds of scenarios in their head because it could potentially scare them. I know it could for me."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:09 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think that's cool.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Alyssa_B,0,Mon Jul 20 07:41:36 2015 UTC,"It can be an incredibly scary thing to talk about. And furthermore, it shouldn't be that big a deal in the first place. Do you tell someone you're interested in every little detail about yourself and your history before you get involved?"
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:15 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be a big deal, but for a lot of people it kinda is. It's not even just about the genitals, for some people just the fact that someone used to be trans would be enough to be completely disinterested. I understand that it's a scary thing to talk about..but 3 weeks is a long time if it ends up being a complete waste of time. I don't think i could disclose anything about myself to someone that would be a deal breaker."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,6,Mon Jul 20 12:54:11 2015 UTC,I don't think we should be catering to those sorts of people and I think 3 weeks is a reasonable amount to not feel comfortable discussing genitalia.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,nakedferengi,2,Mon Jul 20 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know, finding out that the girl I'm into is a closed minded biggot would be a big deal breaker for me."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,2,Mon Jul 20 15:43:40 2015 UTC,I don't think not being into someone who's trans is necessarily bigoted...people are allowed to pick and choose what they're into.
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,babygaythrowaway,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, everyone is allowed their tastes and preferences.  That being said, its a bit alarming that you think trans women who dont out themselves immediately in order to help those who find trans to be a dealbreaker avoid wasting time on them are deceitful.  I mean, how can you not realize that your view on this is at least a little fucked?   You say that there's nothing about yourself that you can think of that would be a dealbreaker, well hey, thats how a lot of us feel about our trans identities."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,TheCameraLady,0,Tue Jul 21 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"I am so so sure that trans women are well aware of the inflammatory nature of their identity.   Hey I'm a fast mover, so three weeks is a ridiculous amount of time for me. it's like if someone lies about their age, 3 weeks of texting and then you find out they're 17, can't bang. No it's not the worst thing in the world, but it's a waste of effort.   Trans women are sometimes scared to share their trans status with people, I feel like if maybe the details were shared sooner rather than later, people would feel less deceived and maybe would react less angrily.    Btw I have no idea how I feel about the whole trans thing generally, I'm not expressing my own personal opinion in these arguments, I just feel that if someone is not ok with dating a trans person, they shouldn't be called bigoted or transphobic for it, because it's simply not the case."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:23 2015 UTC,"Did I say that you were bigoted? Transphobic...maybe. I find anyone not sensitive or empathetic enough to realize that trans disclosure is something that needs to be left to trans people , transphobic or cissexist.  It's not lying. It's not deceitful. And this debate has come up so many times that it gets sickening.  Every trans person should have agency over how they choose to disclose or not disclose to people. Only in extreme cases on the fringe can it be actually deceitful.  I dont really know how to explain this in a way that will change your view on it, and I really dont have the energy. If youre the kind of person who would feel deceived by a trans woman disclosing her status to you on the 3rd or 4th date before physical contact is rven made, then there's really nothing I can tell you is there?  If you actually care, why not read up on what it means to be transgender, and what our lived experiences are like. I promise you that with an open mind, you'll understand better why we feel the way we do about disclosing our trans status on our terms."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,burninglikeabridge,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"it's like if someone lies about their age   But not saying that you are trans is not lying. I have always been totally honest. If they ask me something, like about my periods, I always answer honestly. If someone asks your age and you answer a different age than your own, you are lying. If they don't ask you your age, is it lying to now say your age? Of course not!   If they assume that you are 25 but you are 30, it is their problem for assuming wrong. How could you even know that they assumed wrong if we never talked about it? How many times did you say that you were cis to your new partner? I'm pretty sure it's a big 0. They assumed you were and you let them assume. They happened to be true. If people assume I am cis and they never let me know that they assume wrongly, then it is their problem. My last girlfriend was a nurse and she knew I was trans and she never said anything about it, and neither did I, until we talked about hospitals and she asked if I ever was hospitalized. I said no, that my surgery was done in a clinic and not an hospital. She assumed correctly. If I would have been cis, would I have been lying? Nope.   I feel like if maybe the details were shared sooner rather than later, people would feel less deceived and maybe would react less angrily.    Are you projecting your own feelings, here? No girl has ever felt deceived or reacted angrily to my trans status and trust me, I have dated quite a lot of girls in the last 10 years. Smart girls realize that if they liked me before, they'll will still like me, and I only date smart girls."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Dread9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:36 2015 UTC,Being into them until you find out that doesn't change shit is like being into them until you find out that they went to public school.

You aren't a fraud. Regardless of the way you might relate to your body, you are an authentic woman. Genitalia =/= gender, and in the same vein, lesbian =/= only attracted to cis women. If you don't feel like you can tell her directly, maybe you can find out how she views gender/sexuality in a roundabout way?"

Not so much about them being transgender, but the lying thing.   It would feel like they didn't trust me enough to be their real self with me. I would understand why they wouldn't tell me, but it would still hurt a lot."
actuallesbians,3dwn2e,Kristouph,6,Mon Jul 20 04:39:01 2015 UTC,"Well like I said in another post, I've never actually lied about anything. Whenever it comes to a topic where I might have to mention it, I'll simply tell her that it's complicated, so she knows something is up.  Also you've got to understand it from my point of view too. In the past I've trusted people enough to tell them, only to be betrayed by almost everyone. The fact is that 9 out of 10 people can't keep a secret as big as that. One person tells 2 people, they tell another 4 people, and soon enough it spreads like wild fire. Honestly if I held the grudge at those who betrayed me, I wouldn't have any friends any more, not even my 2 best friends."

It's much less harmful for us to present our true selves (our gender identity) from the start, allow people to get to know the real us, before we share information that would cause someone to question it as a result of ignorance baked into them by society and the media."

My go to treat-yoselfs are new gym clothes or eyeliner. Or maybe a day at the beach or a nice hike that you haven't had time for. Or if cash is tight just sitting around and not doing anything for a whole day except things you find relaxing, like reading or watching TV or writing in a journal or whatever.

I've also dated people so made it very clear that they would be cooking that amount anyways and then it was a ""guilty if I say no"" and ""guilty if I say yes"" thing.   Yes, people should reciprocate in a relationship. But, sometimes financially isn't an option.

When it's out of the city, especially, the price of gas can quickly add up. I never asked her to pay her share. One time we went hiking at a National Park and I didn't have cash to pay the entrance fee, which is like 5$ each or something. She gives me 10$ and tells me I'll owe her 5$... Are you fucking kidding me? The trip is costing me like 30$ in fuel and you are asking me to pay you back the 5$ entrance fee that you paid for me?  This sadly happened with most girls I was with, in one form or another. It's like, if they don't get a bill, they imagine it's free. Like home cooking : You might never see the bill if we don't live together, but it's not because you are not handed a bill at the end of the meal that it is free!"

actuallesbians,3dxylk,hellollamas,13,Mon Jul 20 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"Hey -- this really hit close to home for me. My ex and I talked about being each other's forever person constantly, and we just broke up because we switched into a poly situation too quickly and without enough processing. (And we had done a LOT of processing.)  I found a girl I wanted to be with, and I pushed it too quickly without my ex really being okay. Then I wanted to go back and go more slowly moving forward, but she had found a new person and she pushed it without me really being okay. It broke everything, and I am swimming in regret. She broke up with me because I couldn't deal with jealousy.  My advice at this point is to communicate your discomfort to your partner. You do not need to have a 'valid reason' to be uncomfortable. Me / my ex not listening to each other's requests to stop completely broke us. If you want to stay in the relationship, listening to your partner's needs = the most important thing. Even if it doesn't seem 'rational.'"

My primary partner and I had tons of jealousy after we opened up...there were many times we wanted to just say ""Fuck it, we aren't doing this."" The only way we have been able to get through it is by talking until we get to the root of our jealous feelings.  Your feelings are important. Think about why this friend makes you feel jealous. Ask yourself what you think you stand to lose as a result of their relationship. When you have an answer, approach your girlfriend about it at a calm time (read: not during a fight) and tell her what's up.  If you ever need to talk, I'm here :)"

If I'm feeling anxious and jealous, I may convince myself that my partner is going to fall in love with this other person and realize how much they've been missing/leave our relationship. Realistically, I only lose sexual exclusivity and a bit of time with them depending on when they do it.

actuallesbians,3dxylk,nakedferengi,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:45 2015 UTC,"First rule of poly: everyone needs to be honest and communicate openly. This doesn't seem to be the case here (correct me if I'm wrong), thus making this a surefire way to nuke your relationship.  I got the feeling that you are prioritizing your gf's feelings over your own. Except your feelings are just as valid as hers, and she must deal with your feelings just as you must deal with N, otherwise this is going to blow up in your faces.  I say be honest without being hurtful, and see how she reacts."
actuallesbians,3dxylk,nakedferengi,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"so I asked my girlfriend to stop being sexual with her and she did.   So often that kind of thing has the opposite effect of what you intend. It's like telling someone to NOT think about sex. What else can you do?  Personally, I prefer multiple partners to ""polyamorous"" relationships. To me, it works like this: you're slow dancing with someone special. Someone slithers up next to you, taps your partner, and she slips out of your hands into the other's. --OR-- You're slow dancing with someone and the two of you lift your clasped hands over the head of a third woman, bring her inside your circle and squeeze her in the middle. The latter scenario will have less jealousy, in my experience.  If multi-partner sex doesn't work for you, let your GF loose with her pal. If you don't, the tension is likely to erode your relationship and escalate. If you do, she might leave anyway. But, there is a better chance she'll cherish you for letting her have the fling. No one can predict the future.  Best of luck in any scenario."
actuallesbians,3dxylk,WalpigrsNM,2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is anything wrong with negotiated non monogamy and polyamorous people seem to be as well adjusted as anyone else so no judgement here.  But I get nervous when I see lesbians do this because there is probably actually very high rates of relationship instability in the lesbian community and relationship stability is correlated with improved mental health. I am not saying polyamory is corraleted with high rates of break ups or less happiness.  I do not know the answer to that.  Not everyone is meant to be in life long relationships anyway, its just those that do are statistically likely to be happier.  I could maybe do a spontaneous threesome in another city with my partner (big maybe) but polyamory? There are few emotions more unpleasant to me then jealousy.  This sounds miserable.  Other polys can no doubt answer this better then I but you don't sound very happy.  Are you sure this is right for you?  Perhaps having no strings attached sex TOGETHER with people you don't hang out with may be a better solution to the restlessness you guys feel.  Edit=  Maybe you are bi,  I said ""lesbians"" sorry for assuming if you arent one."

Incompatible people stay together because they haven't found a better option of breaking it off or possible they don't have the resources to do so. Resources could mean anything from monetary (not enough funds to out on their own) to emotional (fear) or mental (I'm just not good enough or I don't want to).

actuallesbians,3du04a,MsBroadcastTech,14,Sun Jul 19 13:26:31 2015 UTC,Courage isn't a competition and it isn't a finite resource!
actuallesbians,3du04a,Dispari_Scuro,2,Sun Jul 19 17:30:19 2015 UTC,Yes! This is exactly what I want to tell everyone who get so upset over this.
actuallesbians,3du04a,Jane_Lane_,42,Sun Jul 19 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"I think Caitlyn Jenner is very much courageous because she grew up during a time when identifying somewhere along the LGBTQQIA+ spectrum was viewed as a taboo topic, where people were treated terribly if they were found to be ""different"" or if they bravely declared that they were different, a time when there wasn't a lot of media coverage that showed queer people in a positive light, and a time when being gay (or anything along those lines) was viewed as an illness.  A lot of people from that time that are now in their 60s and living in North America and probably don't even feel like they can come out as queer and instead, live single lives because they fear stepping out and sharing who they are.  Let alone coming out as trans* which I would think is even more difficult.  Granted, times are starting to change and thankfully that's the case, but there's still a lot of work that needs to be done even in North America.  So while people from younger generations (like mine) are coming out more, the reality is that a lot of people in their 60s are still terrified.  And the harsh reality is that a lot of trans* folk continue to be treated terribly no matter their age or the time that they came from, some people feel like suicide is the only option because they feel like they can't be their true selves out of fear whereas some are severely beaten for simply being who they are in a world that can serve to be more compassionate towards the trans* community.  And, while Caitlyn Jenner has certain privileges based on her celebrity status, being a white woman, and having tons of money.  At the end of the day, having to fight these struggles on any level, but especially publicly would have been terrifying for her (and at one point she said when the tabloids went wild, she felt like suicide was a way out, but thankfully she didn't pursue that option).    So, I guess what I'm trying to say is for anyone that questions whether or not she's courageous, try to imagine her position and the time that she grew up in and the context that is her life.  She has the courage to be herself (finally) despite being terrified for such a long time.  She is bravely declaring who she is, she wants to truly make a difference, and with women as great as Laverne Cox and Janet Mock, I believe that they'd serve as great people to help point out the privileges that she has compared to trans* folk of color and together, I think they can work to help make this place better for all trans* folk.  EDIT: clearly there's a lot of discussion re: the acronym that I chose to use.  I only found out about GSM as an inclusive term today thanks to folks from here.  I hope this doesn't take away from the message that I was trying to get across which is more important than just an acronym in the grand scheme of things."
actuallesbians,3du04a,thehouseshelivedin,6,Sun Jul 19 14:43:26 2015 UTC,What does that second Q and the I next to it stand for? Or are the two Q's together as in 'double queer'.

I don't seem to have the urge to look it up and say it correctly because it doesn't really define anything to me anymore.     To me it's like those cars that have 7 or more bumper stickers to define themselves and express their opinions. And I'm the person that wants the one bumper sticker that says: ""I have opinions."" But then I think: ""Everybody should have that bumper sticker because everybody has opinions!"" But then we're back to square one, aren't we? Because if everybody has that bumper sticker. Nobody needs it."

actuallesbians,3du04a,murexmuris,10,Sun Jul 19 14:51:50 2015 UTC,"It's actually really curious the difference between area's and how they deal with personal pronouns. Back home (The Netherlands), everybody I know whom I've spoken to about the subject of gender will refer to the person we're talking about by their self-identified gender immediately. That never seems to be the discussion.     Here in the U.S., most of the people I've spoken to will switch pronouns and usually end up saying ""he, she, I don't know what to call it.""      However, I understand this confusion. Being uncomfortable identifying a pronoun. It's not an unwillingness to understand and not necessarily ignorant. Some people have never been confronted with the fact that you can identify as a different gender than that you were born as. They're not surrounded by people who will broach the subject of gender. It's foreign to them and I don't think that being too critical of that lack of knowledge is very constructive.     People don't like being told that they're perception is wrong. When I come into contact with someone whom I've just described, and we wander into the subject of gender; I will only sketch them a scenario that they might relate to. And if they ask for my opinion I will tell them what I think. If not; everyone has their own journey through life and they can pick and choose which things they want to expose themselves to during that journey. Unless they open up the discussion, it is really none of my business.     Although of course, most of us want our day in court when it comes  to our opinion. That's quite natural isn't it? It makes us fight for what we believe in. But hopefully it will leave us room to take another's perception into account and understand where they're coming from and where they are heading.     (This is not a criticism on you btw, /u/NHDruj.

actuallesbians,3du04a,murexmuris,11,Sun Jul 19 18:01:35 2015 UTC,I have advised my friends that if ever they don't know which pronoun to use (like actually don't know and aren't just an ass) then just don't use any. It isn't that difficult. Closeted gay people do it all the time.

actuallesbians,3du04a,lizgger15,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has to do with the language. The pronouns basically work the same and are treated the same. So as an example: gay marriage has been legal since April of 2001. A large portion of the population is progressive and accepting.   Also I think that it might have something to do with the fact that a large part of the population is either agnostic, atheist or more liberally religious. Now there most certainly are issues with gender minorities but the discussion is very much open and gets a lot of attention from politics and legislature."
actuallesbians,3du04a,Staple_Sauce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I knew the Netherlands was progressive but somehow managed to forget you guys were the first to legalize same-sex marriage. I remember when that happened, seems like ages ago. Attitudes towards same-sex marriage and LGBT people in the US have changed so much since then, it's great looking back.  Also looking at the wiki article for same-sex marriage in the Netherlands, it mentions how the Dutch Remonstrants started doing same-sex marriages back in the 80s. Pretty awesome."
actuallesbians,3du04a,mollymollykelkel,3,Sun Jul 19 21:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well the U.S. is already far more progressive than most think since the battle for equal rights has gone so well soon. There are still a lot of European countries who haven't legalised gay marriage even though a lot of people assume they have.  I miss The Netherlands a lot and it looks like I will be moving back before the end of this year. Even though it's great that the politics, the legislature and the healthcare system resemble something I agree with more, it isn't part of the reason I want to move back.

When I was in middle school and first learning that same-sex marriage was a thing (this was a while after the Netherlands legalized it, I think it was Massachusetts legalizing it that got me thinking about it) I never would have imagined that I would be able to legally marry a woman 11 years later. We've gone from same-sex marriage being seen as completely unrealistic and a joke to it being an accepted (by a lot of people) part of American life.  Ended up rambling a bit there, but tl;dr progress is good. Good luck with your move!"

actuallesbians,3duir2,chickennachos,11,Sun Jul 19 19:04:57 2015 UTC,Probably matters by the location/bar etc.  There are definitely gay bars that are more geared towards men vs those geared towards women.

actuallesbians,3duir2,reallyenergeticname,6,Sun Jul 19 17:16:59 2015 UTC,"I would suggest trying to find gay bars near you/Wichita/Kansas City online and seeing if they have a ladies night.  I grew up in the burbs and there were a few gay/lesbian bars -- they had to appeal to both groups or they wouldn't have been able to stay open.  They had a girl's night/guys night and a few other ""themes"" occasionally.  Hint: piano bar night = gay men; softball night = gay women.  I personally liked the mix, I felt that it cut the tension a bit and it was so much easier to talk to someone because it wasn't a huge community.    If you go to a bar that's predominantly for gay men -- yeah, it will definitely be slim pickings.  I find the majority of women in gay male bars are hags/drunken bachelorette parties/girls looking to dance.  That being said -- I live in Chicago and you'd think there'd be all these options for women, and there just isn't.  I think there are 2 bars predominantly for women and most girls don't even know about them.  So depending on what the overall slant is in the city you go to -- it may just be rough for raptor on the prowl regardless."

Tell him about your breakup, but if you're not in a good place right now or think you couldn't handle his worst reaction, wait to come out.  That being said, my conservative grandmother and I are very close, but I had a similar situation where I decided I wasn't in a good enough place to come out to her yet after I broke up with my boyfriend.  I am so glad I waited, because at the time I had way too many feelings to explain anything to her very well.  But, I came out to her recently and it went great!!  I think it was definitely partly because I feel more comfortable with myself now and I don't need as much validation from my family as I used to.  But also my grandma is just cooler than I thought--hopefully your dad is too!  Good luck!!"
actuallesbians,3dxvkf,hellollamas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"My parents are liberals, so I often underestimate the oddness of some people. Nonetheless, my advice is to be who you are, assume the best, expect everyone to be positive, and let those who have their own problems deal with them on their own.  Many homophobes have softened in recent years. Look at the arc of public opinion: California votes to ban same-sex marriages in 2000 and fifteen years later embraces the Supreme Court decision with wild enthusiasm. Be positive and assume your dad has made the same mental journey. Give him the benefit of the doubt.  Then call him up and tell him, in positive upbeat tones, who you really are. Regardless of where he's coming from, he will probably require time to adjust his headset. Even if he is homophobic, it's different when your daughter comes out. Keep it short, tell him how much his support means to you, especially since you don't have a mother anymore. Expect him to say something awkward/stupid. Be patient.  Best of luck!"

You could go with vaguely-romantic, like dinner or chocolates, or treat her to a movie.  You could do something with her, like go to a theme park or on a hike.  Limit it to a day-trip at most, though - no overnights, no camping trips, not this early-on.  My first birthday into my relationship with my wife, she flew me down to meet her family.  We'd been dating for a few months, essentially lived together (met in the dorms) and had made it to ""I love you"" by that point, though.  Plus she'd already spent time with my family.  But a few weeks into dating, we went to see The Incredibles together (not for a birthday or anything, just a date).  Just to give you a barometer for where my experience is coming from on this.

I'm not even exaggerating, I had no friends and I absolutely hated life. I saw absolutely no point in living, then I went to College after failing A Levels, I went on a course I knew I'd enjoy. I decided to put myself out there and not distance myself. I have a lovely bunch of friends, I got the courage to come out to them and they were all so loving and supportive. Coming out to my friends was like a backbone to coming out to my family, told my siblings first which went well. Then my mum (although back when I was questioning myself, she said it was a phase) and my Dad on new years. My dad is slightly homophobic, I've had times he's upset me but yes, it gets better and I actually love life right now. C:"
actuallesbians,3dwpmf,isSlowpokeReal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:14:28 2015 UTC,"That was me in high school. This is really specific and maybe sort of crazy but I didn't become comfortable with my sexuality until I became comfortable with my gender presentation. I had always wanted to act and be more ""feminine"", because those are the types of girls that I found attractive, but I wasn't sure how to do it and dressing ""girly"" was discouraged by my mom when I was growing up. I think the take away here is that you have to be completely comfortable with yourself to come out. But that's really not easy as a teenager.   Another thing that helped me was learning most women who aren't totally homophobic like being flirted with by anyone who's non-threatening. It just feels good to think that someone is into you. And it can also make them more attracted to you, because they get used to feeling good when you talk to them. As far as guys go, I think they put girls into two categories: want to sleep with and don't want to sleep with. Beyond that it seems like they really don't make a lot of judgments unless you're unusually annoying which you don't come off as.  I hope this helped a little and a promise it will get better as you come into your own a little."

Be who you are and let anyone who has a problem with it go have their problem somewhere else. Hold your head up, be proud of your accomplishments and learn from your failures. Your orientation is a small part of your career and overall life.   When you're 16, fitting in and being cool, are big parts of the herd mentality that is an important part of the human experience. But as you get older, you'll find what's cool is when someone has the courage to express his or her individuality. And there are many herds, go find one you can lead.  Best of luck!"

We ended up sitting next to one another riding in a friend's car on the way back from the theater. We hit it off pretty quickly, but I thought she was just really friendly. We talked over facebook a few times, and the next week some friends were coming over to have dinner at my house. I invited her to come too.   While everyone else went into the other room to watch something on Netflix, we stayed at the table talking for several hours. She was...fascinating. Just absolutely intriguing to talk to. We talked about everything from board games to work and school to music to politics to our families to philosophy. It helped that I thought she was gorgeous too.   After about 4 hours, she said ""I think you're pretty awesome. I like you."" I, clueless again, said ""Aww! I like you too."" She said ""No, I don't think you get what I'm saying. I like you."" It took me about 5 seconds of blank staring before she raised her eyebrow and cocked her head to the side, and I was done. She had me.  I said ""I'd like to kiss you, if that's alright.""

It really doesn't matter if you're a huge nerd or a huge sports fan or you make cute shit and sell it etsy, just run with it and be yourself.  Be outgoing.  I'm not saying you have to be at the club every night though, if your version of being outgoing just means actually talking about the book you're reading with somebody, then roll with it.  The notion of sitting down next to her and ranting about an academic   paper that I was writing scared the pants off of me.  Our first date was wandering around and talking about life while I took architectural photos.  She drug me to lectures on religious studies and anthropology, a subject that I now love.

When I met my wife I joked with our mutual friend that she was my ideal type, physically. We both had something going on and she was out of my league so I didn't think much of it. She was my ideal type physically but as I hung out with her that day I realized she was my ideal type mentally too. Educated, easy going, adventurous, well spoken, a little nerdy, a little pop culturey, just so perfectly well rounded. These were all very attractive. She was so out of reach I just added her on FB and let it go. (And damn if our FBs didn't show how much more compatible we were, darn!)  We met up a few months later and randomly got drunk and hooked up and apparently it was damn good for both of us because we were inseparable after. This is when she impressed me. Her family was such a priority to her, she always talked about them, especially her niece. Also, she said please thank you and excuse me always. To friends, family, service professionals and strangers. That was a BIG one. When someone is universally polite like that, it just shows that they have respect for people. She had great manners too. Always cleans up after herself and if she says she will be somewhere at a certain time, she is. In fact 95% of the time she's early. These sound so silly but when you've been with someone without them it makes a big difference.  Don't change who you are to attract or impress someone. Being your genuine self will do the work, you just have to be patient long enough for the right person to notice."

I trusted her, more than most people than and more than anybody today.  She is insanely honest, blunt is what she calls it. I never have to worry about what she may or may not be thinking. Sure, her thoughts are not always pleasant, but at least I know. My last two girlfriends dumped me over things I never even knew about, at least until after the fact, which has made me even more paranoid than I already was.

Even when we were just friends (as far as I was aware of) I was always really excited to see her and talk to her. Somedays we'd text/message for so long that I didn't do anything I was supposed to (like 5+ hours straight heh  in one night).   We have and had a  really strong connection (enough that it was able to awaken my repressed sexuality) which was what attracted me to her.   I definitely became much more attracted to her physically when she cut her hair short but thats a kinda me specific thing, she also got more confident and stuff as a result so that helped too"
actuallesbians,3dufqo,Maddwithherbox,6,Mon Jul 20 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"She's so incredibly easy to talk to. Like unbelievably so. I'm confident I could tell her anything, and we both fit each other's levels of goofyness perfectly. I found myself just making more and time to talk to her.

She had gone to my high school but was at a rivaling one that year as her mother had sent her away to live with her father.  She attracted me by saying hi first, and then promptly turning me down for a date.  Things went on like this, she pushed me away time and time again, but I told her that I would stop at no lengths to win her heart.  She would say I was annoying and awkward; all while being the one that texted me first.  We got together and she left me twice... Before I finally got the hooks in right by my junior year of high school.  She's a year older and we survived the college/high school year gap, and just celebrated our 5 year anniversary this past July 13th.  I told her she would be mine, but she gave herself to me bit by bit.  I don't really think I'm going to be letting her go anytime soon, and the best part now is knowing that she feels just as attached."

actuallesbians,3dufqo,thefivehole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"We met on OKC and texted forever and then went on a date. This was about a month ago, maybe?  It's just everything about her, really. We have so much in common and from the first text I knew that I was going to develop feelings for her. Driving up to our meet-up spot for the date was so nerve wracking, because I was already kind of emotionally invested in her. I kind of knew from our texting that we were, at the least, going to be hella awesome friends, but I was so nervous because I wanted the meeting to go well and I wanted to be more than friends and I wanted her to like me and wanna date me.  But when I got out of the car and saw her? My nervousness floated away. Well, I’m sure it was still there, but the overwhelming excitement of being in the presence of somebody who just got me kind of took over. Her passion for her job and for self-improvement was one of the most attractive qualities I’ve ever seen. Her beauty was exquisite, her humour completely on my level, and her eyebrow game was on point. She's absolutely brilliant and she knows so much about things I know nothing about, and for somebody who loves to learn, I just found her fascinating from the get-go. I was blown away by this girl and I suddenly, after 22 years of being able to successfully at least pretend to be confident, felt awkward and clumsy and like she was out of my league and I was playing a game that I didn’t know the rules of yet (this may be my first girl relationship of any level of seriousness). I’m a talker though, and I talked about myself a lot and my family and my own job and probably overshared way too much.  I think the moment though was when I learned how shy and nervous she was about this; when I learned that she thought I was unbelievably adorable and somehow she got the notion in her head that I was way out of her league. Which is ridiculous, of course, but I realized that we are two people who like each other more than may be normal or safe for such a short period of time, and both of us are nervous about messing things up. It all felt so… human. And real. And just honest.   I never stood a chance. This girl will take my heart, I’m pretty positive."

actuallesbians,3dvo4q,amiabadqueer,22,Sun Jul 19 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what you're describing is a thing in our community. I'll even admit to sometimes being one of those lesbians who've had less than generous thought towards bisexual women in the past. And it's not ok. It's prejudice, plain and simple. Like with all prejudices we have to constantly challenge ourselves when we stray to those kind of thoughts and actions. Because those of us who've perpetuated that kind of bullshit are the problem and we need to deal with them ourselves. That's what I do, and I think I'm less of an idiot because of it.  You've found someone you love and want to be with and that's great. So at least this particular lesbian wishes you all the best."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,NHDruj,7,Sun Jul 19 23:00:00 2015 UTC,Can I ask why those less than nice feelings are there? Like what exactly about being bisexual makes people look down on me? I mean even look at the down votes...this seems like the prevalent opinion
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,CookieDoh,10,Mon Jul 20 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"I've identified as bi for awhile now, and even my close friends think it's still a phase because I haven't dated any women yet. I think if I'm having sex dreams about women and get wet thinking about sucking on a girls nipple, I'm at least fucking bisexual. Honestly it's easier for me to have relationships with guys just because of the dating pool. I've met and known a few bisexuals and they have also dated more men than women.  It's just easier for men to be ok with you being into women than women being ok with you being into men. It is already a small dating pool women to women then to say that you like men too, it just makes some lesbians insecure about the possibility of losing a girl to a man. But in reality it shouldnt matter if your girlfriend leaves you for the other sex, it has nothing to do with them persay, but it's taken personally for whatever reason."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,alittlefallofrain,7,Mon Jul 20 01:21:10 2015 UTC,"As another poster said - the insecure, irrational part of me would be afraid of losing a girl to a man (why is this worse than the possibility of losing a girl to another woman? No idea), or maybe not being ""as good as"" a man. The fear of not fulfilling someone, as a woman, who might prefer a man instead. Also, girls who say they are bisexual or questioning, flirt, start getting involved, and then decide that they're straight after all, which has actually happened to me and my other lesbian friends.   But the prejudice is completely inexcusable, and I definitely wouldn't not date someone just because they're bi, or consider them a ""bad queer"" for dating a man. The attitude toward bi girls in the community is shitty."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,ducktape4everything,2,Mon Jul 20 02:33:30 2015 UTC,Thank for explaining the reasoning for this dislike/prejudice/whatever it is toward bi women.
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,lysergic_asshole,2,Mon Jul 20 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"I'm questioning and most likely bi. The situation of ""Also, girls who say they are bisexual or questioning, flirt, start getting involved, and then decide that they're straight after all,"" really scares me. What if I'm into a relationship with a girl and realize, shit, I'm straight? I don't feel like I can figure out my sexuality any other way other than experimenting (judging by how I figured out I at least liked guys), but I hate the idea of hurting anyone or leading them on."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,ducktape4everything,2,Mon Jul 20 06:34:21 2015 UTC,"You're questioning, and there's no problem with that. Just be up front with the fact that you're looking for casual experiences and be honest about the fact that you're not really sure."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,Tangurena,2,Mon Jul 20 07:08:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely will be upfront about the questioning part. I'm just a little bit uncertain about the whole ""casual experiences"" thing. Because, and this might be a little TMI, I can't imagine being naked in front of someone I haven't known for a while. Not judging those who like one night stands, but that would result in me being too nervous to enjoy anything."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,nakedferengi,5,Mon Jul 20 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why those less than nice feelings are there?    Because ""I'm going back to men"" has been claimed as a reason for breaking up: whether it was true or not. So women who are 100% into women will get twitchy about women who are not 100% into women. Consequentially, ""bisexual"" gets added to the list of red flags when considering who to date (versus who not-to-date).     i feel bad because...maybe their girlfriend was bisexual?      How about, ""maybe their girlfriend lied, thinking it would lessen the pain of the breakup""? Have you every rephrased things to try to minimize the emotional pain of the listener? Have you ever said ""it isn't you, it is me"" when that wasn't true? I've done that. I try to be honest, but I still do it (and later kick myself for doing it one more damned time).    Like what exactly about being bisexual makes people look down on me?     Some folks see things as a binary: you are either straight or gay and there is nothing between the two (President Bush phrased that as ""you're either with us or against us""). To them, someone who says ""pan"" or ""bi"" triggers a reflexive ""don't just sit there, shit or get off the pot"" response. To them, you haven't shown that you're loyal to the group identity. Some types of groups are more concerned with group loyalty than others. Jonathan Haidt wrote some books and papers about it and how it applies to politics.     http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GHKMIWD.inpress.MFT.AESP.pdf http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind?language=en http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/books/review/the-righteous-mind-by-jonathan-haidt.html?_r=0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory http://politicsofthemind.com/2012/12/01/the-six-moral-foundations-the-real-issues-lying-beneath-the-surface-of-political-debate/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_either_with_us,_or_against_us    Combine the twitchy-ness with identity politics (""you're with us or against us"") and you get a toxic situation where you have to prove fealty to identity politics (swearing fealty is insufficient). It is like the GOP presidential campaign politics: candidates now have to prove that they are aligned with positions that they were opposed to in the past.  Welcome back to Junior High School."

Especially all the bisexual coming out posts here, I always used to think 'why does anyone need to come out as bisexual?' It's just never seemed like a big deal to me, half the people I know are bisexual, it's just always seemed the norm. I've been being biphobic without even realising it :/"
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,NHDruj,2,Mon Jul 20 09:39:10 2015 UTC,"I posted this on another post recently, but it might also answer your question:  Part of it is being cheated on with the opposite gender and then blaming it on sexuality instead of character.  Part of it is people realizing their (homo)sexuality in stages instead of immediately coming to terms with being gay, and then projecting that experience onto others that are actually JUST bi.  Part of it is jealousy because gay people cannot find fulfillment in a ""socially acceptable"" relationship.  Part of it is confusing bi with poly by people who see polyamory as a cop out used by people who ""refuse to commit"".  Part of it is people with the same prejudices as (bigoted) straight people, except the prejudice is not about which gender you are attracted to, but how many.  It always breaks down to some combination of ignorance and fear. Sadly, bisexuality represents a lot of different things people are afraid of.  Sorry you have to deal with that. Being disrespected and invalidated is an awful feeling. Being shunned by the community you are supposed to be able to reach out to for help dealing with it is even worse."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,lysergic_asshole,2,Mon Jul 20 09:06:09 2015 UTC,"It's hard to put a finger on. But I think it could might have something to do with simple groupthink, that we in the community feel we're supposed to be on the outside (in this case, not do what the mainstream does and date people of the opposite gender) and share in that. When someone strays from that in any way, they run the risk of being ostracized.  Also, it's probably a good deal insecurity. It was on my part, at least. I've always struggled with poor self-confidence and self-esteem and I didn't see why a bisexual woman would ever want to be with me if she had the option of doing the more widely accepted thing and being with a guy. In my case, that notion was reinforced when my partner cheated on me and left me for her ex-boyfriend.  Oh and to clarify, this isn't some kind of justification for those things, just an attempt at an explanation."
actuallesbians,3dvo4q,lysergic_asshole,10,Mon Jul 20 09:36:00 2015 UTC,"Hey girl, I'm there with you. I'm also about a 5 on the Kinsey scale, slightly more attracted to women I guess (I don't think I've ever watched porn with a dude in it, it's just not appealing to me?). I'm definitely around queer girls but they just don't see me. It's weird. I don't register on their gaydars, and I'm not even read as an option for them.   Because of this, I've only ever been with dudes. And it's been good, and it's been bad--I've had to deal with things that straight girls just don't understand; can't understand. I'm sick of people demanding sex from me like I'm a sex toy they can just pick out to throw in a threesome. I'm sick of straight boys fetishizing my identity. I'm sick of listening to people I know call queers ""degenerates"" or ""disgusting"" and be scared to stick up for my own community. Too scared to stick up for myself. And I'm sick of the lesbians who listen to the stereotypes that say that bisexual girls are not queer, that we are straight, that we engage with women to get male attention and nothing else.  I am sick of being open about my sexuality and being harassed or invited into threesomes by men who are old enough to be my father. I am sick of hiding my sexuality and feeling like a liar. And I am sick of being told that I am not a ""real queer"" because my relationships are not queer relationships. I was raised in an environment that was alternately Catholic and Evangelical Christian. I despised myself my whole childhood. I thought I was wrong, fundamentally broken, destined to rot in Hell, worthless. I have lingering self-esteem issues and I have had panic attacks about this kind of shit. But nah, none of that counts because I don't have a black-and-white enough sexuality.  Honestly, amiabadqueer, you're not a bad queer. You're a queer and you feel shunted out of queer spaces. And so do I. But I have my allies--a gay male friend, a bi male friend, a bi girl. And we get to talk about this, we get to commiserate, we get to complain and tell our stories and it's good. I've made my own queer space. And you can too."

One time I had a bisexual woman tell me she didn't think bisexual men exist... wtf?   People try to make assumptions about shit they know nothing about all the time. It's in our nature because it's a survival mechanism. Challenging our assumptions can be mentally tiring because it's so ingrained. The gay community has had to deal with ""us vs them"" for a long time and that got ingrained. So when someone comes along that is ""us"" and ""them"" it freaks us out. But we gotta be conscious of that and work to unlearn the behavior. I think talking about it is important."

At least straight people will date me, even if it's usually for fetishistic reasons. Most straight girls won't even sneeze on a bi dude."

Being bi doesn't discredit you; it's misplaced fears and assumptions and the difficulty people (even lesbians) have because of binary thinking. People tend to forget that sexuality isn't confined to with whom you're having sex, but to whom you're sexually attracted. It's like trying to look at two sides of a coin at the same time, right?

Has never bothered me in the slightest, because I trust her and her feelings for me (which she once told me became even stronger when I told her I wasn't bothered about her seeing her ex)."
actuallesbians,3dw4a8,highbury_fields,3,Mon Jul 20 10:37:31 2015 UTC,"My ex-boyfriend came to my wedding.  My wife keeps telling me how weird that was, and I'm over here like, ""But... he's your friend, too!""  Seriously, we dated in HS, I was not attracted to him then, broke up with him because I'm gay, and since then we're video gaming buddies.  I don't get how this is like other instances where the ex-bf comes to your wedding with a man.  Me and this boy... all we did was video game together.  That and a few kisses with too much saliva.  Now my wife and I are friends with him and his long-time gf (and both think she's really hot).  BUT.  Funny anecdote aside.  I'm not friends with the other ex.  The ex-gf who was fucking crazy and is still incredibly immature, even approaching thirty.  But I am an anomaly.  It is incredibly common among both male and female gay populations to be friends with your exes, and to date your friends' exes.  Because everyone in the group has all dated each other!  It's baffling to me, but I also don't have a group of friends (I do a lot of individual friendships but groups are just not something I've really done since I was in HS) and I only have a few queer friends.  So.  Here's what I think, having navigated a relationship for a long time and maintained a friendship with a boy I once dated (who, it turns out, had entirely unreturned feelings for me, but I only learned that after I'd been with my wife for a few months).  If you are uncomfortable, you should talk it out with her.  But maybe talk it out with someone else first so you can really pin down your feelings and why you might feel them.  Then have a calm discussion with her, in which you both lay down your feelings and listen to what she has to say.  Sometimes all you need to do is say what's bugging you in order to take its power away.  This also doesn't have to be only one conversation.  In fact, it should be an ongoing one.  Communication in all things.  There's a reason it's called lesbian processing.  Talk to each other and find out what is bothering you about it, and come up with a solution together.  Ideally, you guys are on the same team.  The goal is to stay that way."
actuallesbians,3dw4a8,Lesbian_Drummer,2,Mon Jul 20 13:27:42 2015 UTC,"You're not being crazy, but I also feel like you can't put someone in a box. Inevitably everyone will do what they really want to do. If she still thinks you're the greatest girl in the world, she'll stay loyal to you. It doesn't hurt to voice your concerns, but I feel like ""banning"" someone from seeing someone else is useless/will backfire."
actuallesbians,3dw4a8,illegalpipedreams,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'm in a somewhat similar situation except I'm in your girlfriend's shoes. I've been dating my current girlfriend since the beginning of the year. She's great but a wee bit more territorial than I'm used to. I tend to be friends with exes, sometimes close friends, and it annoys me that she notices when I get a text or snapchat from an ex. They're exes for a reason. I have no desire to go back to any of them and I've done nothing wrong. If she were to outright try to ban me from communicating with any of them, it would be a fight and quite possibly one that would break us up. I've told her that this is something that she needs to get over and hopefully in time she will. However, at the moment, whenever I receive a text from an ex I hope she doesn't happen to notice because I don't want to hear the snark, and that in turn just makes me annoyed because I haven't done anything unfaithful.  Basically you can be watchful but either there's still something there for her or not. Be paranoid about it won't help the situation and in fact might drive her away."
actuallesbians,3dw4a8,squishedmelons,2,Mon Jul 20 04:00:04 2015 UTC,"I let my first girlfriend basically do whatever she wanted because I trusted her and I was friends with her ex but it was definitely a mistake.  I let them go to lunch every now and then, talk/text on the phone, game night at her exes family's house since ""her mom missed her"" and stuff like that.  We were all pretty immature at 20-21 so that plays a roll as well. I like to think of myself also as avoiding drama and chill.  The problem was that they both loved drama so having each other around created that, where I didn't.  How old are you guys?  If you are all mature adults then I don't think it's too big of an issue right now."
actuallesbians,3dw4a8,szmhjc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:00:03 2015 UTC,"One scenario: You trust her and let her do what she wants. She'll either stay with you or she won't. Hopefully she'll be honest about her intentions like a decent human being.  Another scenario: You distrust her, try to control her, inevitably fight, and she ends up doing what she wants anyway. Basically the same situation as above except with an extra helping of drama.  I hang out with a few of my exes still as friends, and I encourage my partners to hang out with their exes as well if they feel like it. I trust my partner until I'm given a reason not to. I wouldn't be upset if my partner wanted to leave me to go back to an ex, as long they were honest about it. But if my partner cheats or doesn't trust me, I'm gone with no love lost."

The thing for me was that I would never go back to my ex because for me what's done is done. On the other hand the girl I was in a relationship told me she still really cared for her ex. I don't know if she got back with her but, as you can see it can go either way. Just keep an eye out, if she really cares about you and loves you then there really shouldn't be anything to worry about."

I like a tomboy style but I have a very girly figure. I love my body and I like how their v-neck shirts fit through my shoulders and still so I can enjoy mens fashion but still look like myself (such as I am). And whatever they make their v neck t-shirts out of, its amazing. I wear an XS in regular cut T's but if its a slim cut I like to get a small just so I'm not strangled at the armpits (not cute). The button downs are a bit harder to nail down on Jcrew. I have gotten a few and none of them have really fit well straight off the hanger. But I always take my stuff to a tailor and he's usually able to make it into a custom fit shirt for me. Its a small additional cost, but so worth the money in my opinion especially if the shirt is super cheap. If you like vintage t-shirts like I do, you might try Etsy. I've gotten some pretty cool ringers and cute old shirts from the 70s and 80s there, and mostly I've found that a small fits best. I think they were all slimmer cut back then or something. Karmaloop, Jackthreads, Backcountry, and Buckle are great sites for stuff on sale."

So if I need dress shoes, I know I need to stop in Friday...It's kind of complicated, but it's easier if you have a relationship with one or two of the sales people.

She was 20 and I was 21 at the time. I asked her why in the world she used hand sanitizer on it and she said she meant to wash it out before we used it but got carried away and forgot. It was our first time using a toy and we quickly caught up on how to properly clean a toy but she felt safer with condoms after that.   I prefer to use them to avoid having my partners go through anything like that again and like thornsandroses mentioned, easier clean up."

Are you legit giving her a key to your home after one date?   Edit: I read through all of your previous posts on this situation and honestly girl, I gotta tell you....she seems a little unstable. I know I'll probably get down voted for not being ultra supportive and telling you how adorable this scenario is, but I've been through a very similar relationship. I met a girl who was older than me by your same age gap. She was suuuuuuper sweet to me and so charismatic. I started noticing some jealous tendencies after a while though but thought it was endearing. The jealousy became more and more intense over the following weeks and it got to the point that I seriously became scared of her. She even let me know that she had a warrant out for her arrest for assault towards another girl that had cheated on her....After a HUGE blowup fight one night, I woke up next to her and realized this is not what I wanted. I was terrified of her. I slipped out of bed in just my sports bra and shorts and drove away. I called the police and had her physically removed from my house.   All I'm saying is just don't rush into this. You guys weren't even in a relationship yet and she flipped out in a jealous rage. That's not cute. Take it slow and for God's sake, don't give her a key to your home yet."

I'd really recommend heading downtown- the VAST majority of my queer social interactions have been at the local's bars downtown; most of my queer friends (and I) work and play downtown and in the adjacent arts district- try Artifice (SO MANY queer lady bartenders) and The Griffin, Commonwealth, Beauty Bar, Don't Tell Mama..."

actuallesbians,3dsn4c,pancakemixes,9,Sun Jul 19 06:32:55 2015 UTC,"Well, I live in the western prairies of Canada, and she recently got a permanent residency in Costa Rica. So, the sea can thing is extra interesting because with only a little bit of tweaking it's supposedly appropriate for both!  In Canada, the #1 thing is insulation. It gets so damn cold you can't cheap out on insulation, but the space is already quite limited so you have to get creative in how you do it. Our solution is burying the thing, and insulating the top a little extra because it'll be just under a concrete pad. But we need to test it out, see if it's livable.  In Costa Rica, that gets reversed. You -will- poach to death in an unventilated sea can, and you need something to keep the sun off as much as possible.  It's been a super awesome time working with my engineer brother to figure out that strategy!"

actuallesbians,3duqb7,hannaguist,7,Sun Jul 19 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'd like this for female characters in general in comics.  I used to love comics, but recently I've found it very hard to find any that interest me, because of the ridiculous way in which the majority of female characters are depicted - Escher Girls frequently does an excellent job of highlighting this."
actuallesbians,3duqb7,pyrespirit,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Are you also getting the impression that this has been happening a lot in the recent years? I mean, there was a much better representation of female characters in the '80s! Thank goodness for The Hunger Games and Mad Max: Fury Road."
actuallesbians,3duqb7,pyrespirit,3,Sun Jul 19 22:46:49 2015 UTC,"While there were a lot of bad representations of female characters throughout the decades past, it's definitely become worse in recent years.  The 90s was really the last time I really enjoyed comics in general, but the majority of my favourite comics come from the 70s and 80s.  I've recently been re-reading the Dark Phoenix Saga from Marvel, and noticing how much more realistically proportioned the characters were in general - though the ridiculous female superhero outfits were really starting to come into fashion by then.  The impact that Rob Liefeld and people like him has had on comics has been disastrous."

actuallesbians,3duqb7,snapdragonj,8,Mon Jul 20 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"Real people! There's a lot of good points here, but I feel I should add something about my interest level in women in comics in general.  I've been getting into comics throughout 2015 and don't have many women characters I like. I find the men and their flaws more interesting, such as Hawkeye and his baggage from a difficult youth and feeling like the ""regular guy"" among the Avengers. In comparison, the woman who also shares his title and talents from Young Avengers who works with him has... no flaws that I know? Maybe it's that she's young and naive? Too talented? Too witty? I don't know. She's funny but I wouldn't buy a comic about her or the Young Avengers from what I've seen.   I'd really love to read about women and lesbians in comics, but as a newbie I feel like I either have to choose a token woman (read about her because she's a woman and strong, and therefore I should like her) or read about hetero men. I don't dislike reading about the men, I just wish I could find a lady equivalent of Spider-Man, Rorschach, or others who are as complex, human, and as downright messed-up sometimes. I know there's a Spider-Gwen now, but I don't know if she's going to be like Young Avengers Hawkeye or excite me and make me cringe the same way the Spider-Man movies did--I haven't gotten to the comics of either yet.  Watchmen was an absolute favorite, but I didn't like Laurie/Silk Spectre at all. I know the creator intended for her to make a statement about women and women in comics (supposedly), but I found her to annoying, more of a statement than a character, and less interesting than Rorschach or Nite Owl, who were more central to the story and more caught up in the superhero stuff. To me she only had one shining moment at the very end. I didn't even read her Before Watchmen piece, because it just looked like more mother drama and growing pains to me, while Rorschach and Nite Owl were developing as heroes and fighting bad guys.  Whew. Ramble over. I hope this doesn't come off wrong, I just really want to see women who aren't strong and feminist or making statements about feminism, but compelling and relatable in their own right while still being fantastical--which is the whole point of heroes. I don't want to like them because they're hot or because they're women or because they're lesbians or because they're not men. I want to like them because they're amazing and speak to me, the way Dan Dreiberg's attachment to the Nite Owl character in hard times spoke to me.  Anyway, one example of a well-done lesbian in my opinion is a woman called Blu Rain in the movie Precious. I had to watch it for a class and was absolutely in love with her personality and spirit. I really got the impression she was a beautiful soul hiding deep wounds who was trying to be strong for her students who had no one else. She was witty, empathetic, and a brilliant communicator who stuck her neck out to make change. There were some moments where she hinted at darkness and how much she really understood it, and everything she'd done to get past the point her students were at. I think a five-second point in a conversation made it clear to me why she worked so hard on what she did, and gave me the opportunity to understand her from my own experience in a way that was memorable. Her being a lesbian was just who she was, it slipped in when the students got to know who she was outside of the classroom. They shared Christmas when one student visited. Her wife came to visit her students, congratulate their successes, and cheer them on."
actuallesbians,3duqb7,snapdragonj,5,Sun Jul 19 19:02:00 2015 UTC,I kind of loved Oracle. Barbara Gordon got so much more fucking interesting when she was paralyzed and had to use her brains and her connections to fight villains instead of being Generic Superhero Number Three. Sad they gave her legs back for that reason.

actuallesbians,3duqb7,thwinnblue,4,Sun Jul 19 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"You should look into it. She had a bit of a crossover with the Black Canary in early Nightwing comics, which is where I first came across the storyline. Damn good, IMO.  EDIT: Of course the storyline really starts with The Killing Joke, which is Batman, not Nightwing."

The preface is by Rachel Maddow, the art is really great, and the story is awesome, with a lot of insights into Batwoman's life as a regular person, being in the military and having to quit because of being a lesbian, and also her relationship with her family and women in general. So, I would recommend that for sure."

actuallesbians,3duqb7,ampmz,4,Sun Jul 19 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"The psycho lesbian trope is bad, but I really would love to see more lesbian characters with mental illnesses and neuroatypical lesbians. It's not addressed in an accepting manner everywhere else so you're outta luck if you want to see it in queer media.   On top of that, more lesbians who are vehemently feminists. Most people are afraid of the image it'll cast of the stereotypical feminist and kind of gloss it over/make the character a joke but it's just not very realistic to see every lesbian depiction removed from her feminism."
actuallesbians,3duqb7,terabinthia,3,Sun Jul 19 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about feminists' representation and risks of stereotyping. I was wondering, what do you think of stories that are clearly feminist in content even if they never directly claim to be feminists? For example, my characters never mention explicitly feminism, as they live in a different universe and in a different time where women and men are truly equal, but there are still of lot of points that are a very important part of feminism (for example, children exploitation). Do you think a contribution like mine should be made more explicit or would you welcome more explicit contributions?"
actuallesbians,3duqb7,maggerson1,3,Sun Jul 19 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"Even if the word feminist isn't mentioned by name more lesbians being represented resisting a status quo and knowing they are doing so works just as well and is what I'd want to see.  Yeah, context in a story is everything. But feminist in content with clear parallels to the real world's systems featuring lesbians would be great, even if its not pointed out this is feminism."

The first girl I seriously talked with on Tinder we texted every day for about 3 months before we met. We thought ourselves to be on a friends level, but then we hit it off. Couple months later when I moved up to the bay area - with guidance and help from her (but both knowing we didn't want a relationship) - she became a ghost and I've talked with her less in the 9 months I've been here than a single month previously.  It's hard, but you have to learn to not take it too seriously. Sometimes you feel you're hitting it off over text and there's no in-person chemistry. Or she found someone she's really interested in. Or is just really busy with life. I've been on both ends of all these scenarios, they happen. It did take me a while to get over the level of communication with that girl, but really there's only so much you can do. If they're not interested, they're not interested."
actuallesbians,3dv6z2,chiruni,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"But there was in-person chemistry.

And I don't mind her being in a relationship with someone except that I know she's not because she's moving away in a few months.  She was busy with life a month ago because she had stuff to do for university, but I have her on Instagram and she's been going to the beach and going to bars and stuff - she's not busy."

Once specifically I knew I wasn't into at the time, but was polite and she took that as interest. There's two girls I've hung out with a couple times (which reads as: continued interest), but we'll go a month or so before even texting again. I keep occupied in other people and things and if they're interested they come back around. If not, saves me the hassle/heartache.  Going to the beach and bars is busy. She has friends or family she wants to spend time with. If she's moving so soon maybe she's calling off dating until then, or she's dating more people.  I've been in the crazy spot of ""she isn't replying but she's posting/replying on (whatever social media)"". It's not what you want to hear but: she's not interested in pursuing anything further."
