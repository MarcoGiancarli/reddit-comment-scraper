I am a 5 minute walk from the light rail, so I can be downtown in 30 minutes no problem.   Consider it, once you (and everyone else) gets over the stigma associated with trailer parks, we can move forward with being able to provide more affordable/realistic housing for individuals and low income situations."

denverlist,3bsrwj,Kikiwanderer,2,Thu Jul 2 00:24:52 2015 UTC,Thank you. Unfortunately I have no form of apprenticeship. NJ has a different system than most of the rest of the country when it comes to electrical workers. If he knows of anyone that is just looking for a helper at this time let me know. Or any contractor that is looking for a hand.
denverlist,3bsrwj,Kikiwanderer,2,Thu Jul 2 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I believe all you need to do is list the hours you have worked/where. Hubby has no paperwork either and he has been working as a 4th year apprentice for a year and a half. There is a great union out here from what I hear, but he isn't a part of it. Just make sure you register online with the state when you start because he thought the temp service had and now that time is lost (I think)."

There are quite a few truck stops along I-70 (Idaho Springs last I knew had showers) and along I-25 about 30~ min outside the city either N or S.

There are a lot of great areas that are still centrally located that might suit you better and be farther from institutions that you don't feel comfortable around.  Having said that, I have lived in that area and didn't really notice 'floods' of homeless people or have any significant problems there. This was fifteen years ago and the neighborhood was somewhat less nice ( or gentrified, upscale, or whatever term you want to use). Maybe you aren't too familiar with Denver but it doesn't have many 'bad' areas and the ones it does have are really mild compared to a bad area in say Baltimore or St Louis or wherever.
