DotA2,3e2pi5,poduszkowiec,5,Tue Jul 21 18:42:47 2015 UTC,Tiny is awesome with just blink.  But his Agh's upgrade is just so damn good...
DotA2,3e2pi5,MattieShoes,10,Tue Jul 21 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah Agh's is pretty much core on Tiny, but even without it you can still grab a Blink and 100-0 most heroes in the game. It's kinda ridiculous, actually. No other hero has that much burst AND can transition into a hypercarry."
DotA2,3e2pi5,thipp,17,Tue Jul 21 18:55:25 2015 UTC,The funny thing is he's almost never picked up in the pro scene without wisp.
DotA2,3e2pi5,MattieShoes,13,Tue Jul 21 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"Because Tiny is easily the weakest early game character so he really needs a dedicated babysitter. 0 armor at lvl 1, very slow move speed and a pitiful mana pool. You shut tiny down early and he's a sad rock."

DotA2,3e2pi5,randomkidlol,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"Since the recent change that coincides with HoN's pebbles where the throw actually picks the closest target, dagger-oneshot tiny is viable again.  But honestly though? I feel like it's still less viable in Dota 2 than it was in HoN, because you fall off so fast.  It might have had something to do with the difference in skill bracket."
DotA2,3e2pi5,pvmcfi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:56 2015 UTC,"the point of the build is to snowball ahead so you can farm up big attack speed and damage items so you can become a right click carry in the late game. previously, this was tiny's only method to farm efficiently. now that aghs tiny gives him a really good cleave and boosted toss damage, its more reliable for farming than blink arcanes"

DotA2,3e2pi5,pvmcfi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"I feel he was more viable in HON because it was (and remains) a faster paced, brawling game. Every single HON economy change has encouraged teamfighting and pickoffs, and burst is valued extremely highly even on the carries.   Or well, that is my best excuse. I played HON at 1800++ and Pebbles was still a common mid pick, and that was definitely skill equivalent to very high tier DOTA."

DotA2,3e2pi5,Hartwall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:24 2015 UTC,No one said that he can't enjoy the game. He's just not an amazing Invoker because he chooses to be flashy instead of going for plays that output more damage or utility.
DotA2,3e2pi5,joemagoe,18,Tue Jul 21 18:11:59 2015 UTC,How is team wiping the whole enemy team with a refresher tornado-EMP-meteor-deafening blast combo not maximizing damage output..?
DotA2,3e2pi5,mankstar,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:27:59 2015 UTC,"No, but the combos he mentions in that serie I linked are quite efficient, don't care about his pub playing."
DotA2,3e2pi5,Hartwall,11,Tue Jul 21 18:55:05 2015 UTC,He chooses to be flashy because he usually outclasses his opponents and wants to have fun.  He could probably buckle down and go tryhard if required.
DotA2,3e2pi5,lordcirth,24,Tue Jul 21 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"come with ghost walk -> invoke Meteor or EMP -> tornado -> throw Meteor / EMP -> Invoke Blast and throw as Tornado lands  Tornado -> invoke blast -> meatball -> throw blast as Tornado ends -> invoke Sunstrike and throw as Blast ends  tornado -> invoke meteor -> EMP ->  throw Meteor -> invoke and throw Blast -> refresh and throw Meteor again -> invoke and throw EMP again -> Blast again -> invoke and throw something else, like SS / coldsnap / ice wall / another tornado (if you are really tight, you can do everything without any opportunity to use BKB, blink, etc)  among some others.. Many combos are built around the duration of Tornado and Deafening Blast being the same as Invoke cooldown with aghs (blast is 1.75s, tornado 2.5, aghs cd is 2, octarine cd is ~ 4)  now, you could argue that combo-voker is a bit lame and I agree to some extent, but aghs is not really obsolete, as it allows you to do some (potentially game changing) things that Octarine does not  Also Aghs + octarine is actually pretty good.. It makes the timing for the combos fairly easy and forgiving (you have 1 second to adjust after every Tornado, and 0.25 second after each blast), instead of kinda tight. I've seen many 7k invoker videos where they buy an aghs mid game and Octarine later."
DotA2,3e2pi5,vrogo,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:08 2015 UTC,3.75 CD is definitely not enough.  2 CD is definitely not enough.  Aghs should make it so invoke has no CD.

DotA2,3e2pi5,romanozvj,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"You don't exactly want to use Refresher for spells like Forge Spirits or Sun Strike snipes. It gives you quite a bit of hp too, which Invoker lacks. Refresher is only good for one nuke combo everyone in a while, but Octarine gives constant benefit."
DotA2,3e2pi5,H47,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"My problem with refresher is you have to wait ages for it to be useful again, I think octa is much better considering all the extra perks but I'm trench tier."
DotA2,3e2pi5,Dr_Jre,3,Tue Jul 21 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"From other comment:   Octarine does give constant benefit indeed, but invoker's great advantage is being able to single handedly tip the teamfight in his favour with his vast amount of spells. teamfights only happen every so often, and octarine doesn't benefit you in one at all apart from the mostly useless spell leech. Refresher lets you cast a huge amount of spells in a teamfight, and if you manage to lose a teamfight after you successfully pull off a refresher combo and cast a couple of cold snaps and ice walls, you are probably doomed to lose the game anyway. Octarine reduces the cooldown on forge spirits - which you don't need, since the duration exceeds the cooldown anyway. It does reduce the cooldown on sunstrike, yes - but by the time you get octarine, you stop raking in kills with sunstrike since the enemies are getting tankier or wiser. I'm not saying octarine is bad, but refresher outclasses both octa and aghs by so much it cannot be put into words. there shouldn't be a discussion honestly, refresher is just better.   Octarine obviously has a bigger uptime, but it's much, much less useful."

DotA2,3e2pi5,Necrotos,-6,Tue Jul 21 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. Unless you're one of those people who does massive wombo combos with invoker, Octarine is better."
DotA2,3e2pi5,DangerAwar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"I find that aghs is more about flexibility than combos.  Ie being able to switch from coldsnap + ghostwalk ganking to 3-spell teamfight combo, then back again to pick off survivors.  Octarine obviously helps, but especially if you get Aghs before lvl 4 invoke, it's much better.  I'm not that great at invoker, tho."
DotA2,3e2pi5,lordcirth,0,Tue Jul 21 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"me too, octarine is good but there is 1.7k gold difference between the aghs and the oct. you can get some armor(AC, Shiva's...etc) or bkb i agree that it's little bit underwhelming but it gives him great stats, and invoking without mana seems not worth the aghs but it's the little details that count, plus being able to spam tornado>EMP>meteor>def blast>ice wall without cooldown on invoke is really good and under appreciated."

That isn't that much if looking by the strength required itself. Rifles weight max5.5kg for 10 m standing and 8kg for 50m prone. Not heavy either (I have shoot with both 10m rifle and a bow, none of them were olympic grade though and I wasn't good at it either). It's not easy ofc, all respect to those training and competing in all of the listed sports, but from a pure physical level of a person, pretty much everyone can pull an arrow and hit 1.5m diam target from 10-15m if he tries for a couple of minutes. Hitting the middle is hard, but winning against Secret would be as well.  But the same argument could be said for esports, try getting some of those high AMPs in starcraft, it's not easy.  In the end, I consider both of those things as a sport, unlike dota2 for example, but just that criteria alone, ""athleticism involved"", is bad."

DotA2,3e2rpi,Chunkey,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"I don't. It's not a sport. No one is every going to accept it as a sport, or anything even like a sport. And I mean, rightfully so.  It's weird how the competitive game communities want to give it that label. It's not going to change anything. There isn't a chance in hell that the bar mentioned above is going to change their opinion because of terminology.   Video games, and playing them profesionally, will only become ""mainstream"" and accepted as video games. The terminology we use to describe the hobby won't get us  there any faster. We ain't fooling anyone."

My mum will still complain that I spent too much time playing video games.  We still won't see it at the olympics.  I can change my name to Bill Gates, but that doesn't get me any richer.

Since every support buys courier, smokes and wards, merely showing the purchase amount is pretty much meaningless. Listing that amount just reinforces the terrible quality info gleaned from Volvo's tutorials and bot games.  Instead it should show vision provided (product of area × time) to team, successful camp stacks, successful counter-wards, successful rotations and counter-ganks, successful smoke ganks, denies by pulling, effectiveness of altruistic items (shared items, mek, urn, force, medaillon), time spent (not) baby-sitting in laning phase, amount of harass damage in laning phase, amount of time the opponent was denied experience/was out of experience range in laning phase."

DotA2,3e1gsl,feminsit,13,Tue Jul 21 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"Dota use to show wards, like 2 years ago.  What happened LITERALLY every game - Flamer picks carry (per usual), Support gets wards / courier etc for 10 mins, then flamer / whatever declares support total shit 'not supporting' and proceeds to buy out all wards from that point on wards. At end of game stats say like:  Support: 4 wards, courier Anti-mage: 12 wards, 20 sentries  Then proceeds to flame, nonstop.  The issue with 'counting' wards is that it only matters now b/c it's not counted. As soon as it's counted, shit-flamer-carries will buy out wards and declare team useless."

DotA2,3e1gsl,1gn1t0r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"This isn't a step in the right direction. It's more pigeon holing what a support does.  Will a Dazzle naturally out heal Lina? yeah, so does that make him a worse support?  Veno using plague wards for vision, or Techies using mines. Does that make them worse?  The problem is we are making complicated mechanics to judge a difficult role under the guise that it will make people want to play it more..."
DotA2,3e1gsl,9Point,3,Tue Jul 21 17:48:06 2015 UTC,"No one is going to gauge lina as a worse support than dazzle due to hero healing. No one has, even when hero healing is already a stat.

DotA2,3e1gsl,DotaStack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:44 2015 UTC,impossible to measure   Do you call everything that is not straight-forward impossible? This hyperbole is not useful to anyone.
DotA2,3e1gsl,daxim,5,Tue Jul 21 15:37:36 2015 UTC,"It's not about ease in doing it. It's about the nature of being a support.  Tracking any amount of items gained doesn't mean anything. Same with vision. These are stats in a vacuum...  A support supports. Yeah, under ideal conditions you can say by buying crow, giving vision, healing. But that's an ideal game...  If as a support your team has a Viper and he picks up mek, do you still buy one since healing is a basic factor in supporting?  You have 2 supports and one buys the crow first. Does that make the other bad?  If you want metrics for supporting they are already there. You want to put forth stats to dictate what a role does? Why?"
DotA2,3e1gsl,9Point,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Ok explain how it is possible to measure for example, a successful smoke gank: go"
DotA2,3e1gsl,DotaStack,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:48 2015 UTC,"we already have the teamfight recap, meaning the game knows when a teamfight happens. If someone smokes and then the consequent teamfight is favorable to the smoking team = successful smoke gank"
DotA2,3e1gsl,Reservoir_cat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:19 2015 UTC,"If it's not a teamfight and you run into the enemy CM instead of the enemy Gyrocopter, is it still a successful smokegank?  If you smoke into enemy woods and don't find anyone, but place 2 great wards is it an unsuccessful smokegank because nobody was ganked, even if it was a successful smoke?  If you smoke into Roshan and get Roshan uncontested is it an unsuccessful smokegank? Or a successful use of smoke?  This is what I mean when I say it can't be measured, because presumably the 'trigger' event is the use of smoke."
DotA2,3e1gsl,DotaStack,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"Of course it can. The game knows what heroes have more networth, it also has some sort of role system (you can check that on the window with all itens and heroes). To check if the smoke gank was good or not the game could gollow these steps: Smoke detected > how many heroes were smoked > how many wards placed while smoked > how many heroes killed after smoke ends (5s time window) > how much net worth does the killed hero have? > hero killed has the lowest networth on enemy team > not so good smoke."
DotA2,3e1gsl,Alyssonnm_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"Ok it boils down to: strategic importance of actions can't be measured accurately by the game(additionally the complexity it entails is simply inefficient to implement).  These are all nice ideas, but they simply don't work for all situations.       What if you kill a comparatively low net worth sand king who was really close to blink?  What if you smoke and kill the enemy dazzle who is lowest networth, but the fact he is dead means the enemy team is unable to take a fight and you get 2 towers or 1 tower and Roshan.  What if the fight has no casualties in 5s?  Strategy cannot be boiled down only to numbers. I agree that sometimes the situation is easily measured (early game 2 hero smoke successfully kills enemy mid, for example). But there are many occasions where this is not the case.  Therefore, not 'of course it can'. Also not going to waste time with more counterexamples because there are uncountable possibilities, and that's what makes the game interesting."

DotA2,3e1gsl,scruff304,8,Tue Jul 21 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"Support is practically a ""utility"" role, based around doing the right thing at the right time. Sometimes the right thing to do is something absurd like sitting behind a tree for a few minutes, and you can't measure that.  Kill participation would probably be the closest thing to measure support activity and influence on the game, and we already have that metric."
DotA2,3e1gsl,jtalin,4,Tue Jul 21 14:04:17 2015 UTC,Info that means nothing. That's why it's a bad idea. You can't measure a good support from stats.
DotA2,3e1gsl,conquer69,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:26 2015 UTC,"You can't necessarily measure a good carry from stats either. Having lots of lasthits is utterly meaningless if you have poor map awareness, decision-making and positioning. Having lots of kills could potentially just mean you ""secured"" many that your team set up for you. Having low lasthits and kills doesn't mean you're bad if you're focusing on taking objectives.  So should we just get rid of all the other information on the scoreboard just because you can't technically measure total skill from them? You can't pretend just one bit of information is useless. More information is not a bad thing.  OP already made a perfect point: it's not about measuring skill, it's about encouraging people. If a carry player sees he has lots of kills and lasthits at the end of the game, he's happy, even if it doesn't necessarily mean he's the next RTZ. More people would be happier playing support if they could see some statistics like number of wards placed, it won't mean they're great supports, but it will mean they've got something to show."
DotA2,3e1gsl,Chuzzwazza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:08 2015 UTC,Same could be said for a carry though. It is all good and well farming and farming and having an amazing CS and gold/min...

Healing and mana restored also are in no way unique to supports as mek/arcanes/guardians are bought very often on cores right now.  These stats wouldn't show early ganks/tp defenses, successful smokes etc. and theres no way they accurately could.  The current stats do a fine job of tracking how involved a support has been imo. If a lion or a dazzle has around 70%+ participation in kills (as in, the number of their kills+assists are fairly close to the total number of their teams kills) and don't have an inordinate amount of deaths, then in my eyes they're as good as the carry who's gone 14/1/5.

The current stats give me little to improve on. I can see how many fights I participated in, basically. My GPM/XPM aren't indicative of my success in many games as a support. I want to know game-to-game how much I've stacked jungle for my carries' XPM. I want to know how I contributed to their numbers in auras. I want to know about my warding efficiency (did I buy them close to cooldown? did I leave them in my inventory or get them on the map? did my sentries even spot anything invisible for the duration? How did my wards compare to the other team in that game?)  There are many many things that stats do not capture, but there are a whole lot of things that simple numbers can do to help players improve and analyze their game.  The uninformed will always find a way to misinterpret stats, but really, 1k games exist and those people are out there misinterpreting the game already. Providing information about the game can give the rest of us good info with insight on how to improve. These things can give sites like dotabuff even more ways to track success across games."

They're 75g a pop, and in low MMR it's really simple to take ~30 seconds and clear out the jungle to make up for the (~150g) lost. I doubt the enemy will be roaming around your jungle and, if they do, you see them long before they see you (You have wards, they don't)."

DotA2,3e1gsl,suyaku92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:30 2015 UTC,I think playing support can be way more fun than playing a hard-carry. As a hard-carry you literally hit creeps for like 30 minutes before you can even think about serious team fighting. Supports are online from minute 1 and only a few really fall off late game (e.g. CM) but most of them have even ultra late game impact.  The only unsatisfying thing is that you really need to care about your positioning in fights. If you are getting initiated you are most likely dead before your team can do something.

DotA2,3e1gsl,burnSTATION,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"i am ranked in low tier and i can say: flamers will always flame, the guys that quit or go afk whatever will do that even if you support very well/be a good carry/draft a good team as captain. thats why they (and unfortunately me and other poor guys) will stay a long time below 3kmmr"
DotA2,3e1gsl,kuramayoko10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:55 2015 UTC,"The more stats the better IMO. But I would like to see some stats like how much actual damage, that contributed to a hero's death, did I do? If you do 1k hero damage and they heal back to full, then it's almost like doing no damage (obviously sending them back to fountain is good but not AS good).  How much damage was mitigated by a player's items/abilities? How much damage did I keep my team from taking with my crimson guard/pipe? How much damage did i save my teammate from taking by disrupting him before a projectile hits? How much more damage did I contribute with my auras? Etc etc.  It will never be perfect but there are a LOT more stats that could be helpful. Although, it would probably be too taxing on the servers."

DotA2,3e1gsl,veggiesama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"Any reasonably competent player knows the necessity of having supports on a team. During their progression they are bound to be a part of teams with 5 carries, no wards and courier and realize how important support heroes skills and items are to the game.  I guess you could argue that something like this would help new players feel more inclined to support earlier on, however personally I wouldn't feel having a 'destroyed wards' stat on the scoreboard would make me play support any more or less then I do now."
DotA2,3e1gsl,KingKoopa2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:44 2015 UTC,I have to say that's the only reason I don't support too often other than that my support role really amazing for my tier.
DotA2,3e1gsl,MJawn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:08 2015 UTC,"supports are actaully pretty popular at high MMR because everyone wants to win and support is actually fun nowadays with the new items and gold sharing.

DotA2,3e1gsl,thehubps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:27 2015 UTC,It is cool that they implemented this is form of runes. But it certainly would be nice to have another field at the Score Table that would show the support impact on the game.

DotA2,3e1gsl,s3vv4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:15 2015 UTC,there's no good way to quantify support play tho honestly. space cannot be measured by AI
DotA2,3e1gsl,SrSnorlax1025,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:42 2015 UTC,this won't make people play more support. in low mmr (i'm here too m8) people won't support anyway. they just want to be the star of the game by going 20/0. it won't make any difference. still frontpage
DotA2,3e1gsl,Benji077,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"People still won't care about supporting. You have to be good at managing an economy to support (items for you vs items for your team) and you have to be willing to take one for the team. Most people just want to be the flashy hero that jumps in and gets all the kills, not the one that buys the wards so that they can farm and get the kills."
DotA2,3e1gsl,Jahordon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"""wards placed"" must be a more useful statistic. just a suggestion."
DotA2,3e1gsl,Croxxxxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately in my opinion it's not possible to quantify really good support play.  Sure, you can show who bought the most wards and who stacked the most camps and who had the most lane harassment in the first 10 minutes of a game.  But how can you quantify the shadow demon who has a perfectly timed disruption to help his hard carry dodge certain death at the 50 minute mark when his buyback is on cooldown?  Shit like that wins games.  Venge swapping to save someone and immediately blinking out of harms way.  Wisp relocating to save the carry.  Perfectly timed guardian angel's by omniknight right when void timewalks into his clumped up team and drops chrono on them.  I wouldn't have a problem with support statistics but, like a lot of other statistics in competitive games, they really won't mean shit."
DotA2,3e1gsl,ptmd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"How about a cell that says support for the team that shows all the things that otherwise go unnoticed, like support items bought (obs, sentries, smoke, dust, gem) and damage taken & healing done?"
DotA2,3e1gsl,huntman1412,12,Tue Jul 21 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"As much as you try to make supporting more attractive the position will always be looked on by the common player as below them. Most of the players below 4K have this delusional idea that they're better than they actually are and they're going to win the game playing carry. Let's face it the majority of gamers want to hit creeps and get kills and see their kda go up not stack camps, place wards and lane support. I always play support for my five stack and you should see the shitstorm that ensues when deciding who plays position 4 and who cores."
DotA2,3e1gsl,CaptainRuhrpott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"support role is boring as shit which is the reason no one wants to pick it  kinda a design flaw imo, basically after 15 minutes into the 40 minute game you can't kill anyone and everyone can kill you."

DotA2,3e1gsl,NeverWinterNights,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"what most higher mmr players don't realize is that low mmrs (1.8-3k) might have a support or two but those supports often don't know what they are doing beyond just buying observers, it's rare that they buy sentries. Camps almost never get stacked even if you ask them. Supports usually pull at the wrong time, or they do single pulls and just push the lane. Supports often don't harass and when they do they take creep aggro so they have to waste their regen because they got mugged by a gang of melee creeps. Smoke ganks do happen but not until at least 15 minutes in and most ganks won't use a smoke and wont occur until 10 minutes at least. The first 10 minutes is a battle of babysitting supports trying to get their carry/offlaner kills rather than farm."

DotA2,3e1h4v,MyNoobIsTeam,183,Tue Jul 21 06:36:50 2015 UTC,I'd still report you.
DotA2,3e1h4v,AlextheGerman,19,Tue Jul 21 06:40:50 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  I've seen one other play like that.  We had a Gyro with a Rapier and Satanic who had been caught out by a Primal Roar.  I blinked in to Disrupt him before the enemy could autoattack him down so that he could heal up with Satanic and kill the enemy team.  You can imagine my shock at what the enemy Omniknight did.
DotA2,3e1h4v,BellisColdwine,17,Tue Jul 21 07:19:23 2015 UTC,Yea haha. Using Repel on the enemy is one of those things that can be game winning or losing.
DotA2,3e1h4v,MyNoobIsTeam,5,Tue Jul 21 07:48:37 2015 UTC,Supports hate him!

DotA2,3e1h4v,ManoftheMarsh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't repel remove the stun buff? Gyro would have got off his auto attacks with Satanic.
DotA2,3e1h4v,whatgenreisthis123,8,Tue Jul 21 14:52:25 2015 UTC,No. Repel is not a strong dispel.
DotA2,3e1h4v,chakigun,4,Tue Jul 21 15:52:55 2015 UTC,Can't you just ult him and then disrupt though. Not sure if you can ult allies.

DotA2,3e1h4v,l_HATE_TRAINS,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:04 2015 UTC,My favorite is repel on the enemy core & naga song. Kill them in the time then easy team fight.
