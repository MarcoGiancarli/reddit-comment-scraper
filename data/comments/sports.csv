sports,3e2otv,klitchell,3,Tue Jul 21 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to look up the actual stats, so this is a bit assumption-heavy.   Assuming the players are spherical  Assuming both players are Bartolo Colon  Assuming both players are halfway through an ""average"" season of 550 ABs (unlikely, since at least one must be a bench player, but I've come this far), and assuming 25% of major league pitchers are lefties, and finally assuming that both have faced the same distribution of pitchers, you can say that each has had 69 at-bats against lefties, and 207 against righties. Of those 276 at-bats, no more than 55 of them could have been hits, to keep both their averages below .200.   Now, assuming each of them is practically incapable of hitting against their non-preferred pitcher, you have Player A going 0 for 69 against lefties, and 55 for 207 against righties. You also have Player B going 55 for 69 against lefties, and 0 for 207 against righties.   How much of a difference could it make to pinch-hit one sub-200 guy for another sub-200 guy? Well if there's a lefty on the mound, it could make .797 points of difference."

sports,3e26dt,remitroamer,5,Tue Jul 21 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"Zach is one of, if not THE, most popular guy on tour. Everybody loves him, so he can't be personality free -- and if you saw his post-win interview he was not boring at all. Really human. I think he just keeps his emotions in check more than most of us like on the course, but as we all know as golfers, that's the best way to not make one bad hole turn into a string of bad holes.   I really think the excitement of this tournament is GREAT for golf. Just because Jordan Spieth ""lost"" on the 71st hole, essentially, doesn't mean most golfers switched the TV off and won't watch again. If they did, they weren't fans of golf, they were fans of Spieth."

Obsessive people don't commonly have great personalities.    IMO, Rory and Tiger are pretty boring too.  The only difference between them and Zach Johnson is they have a lot more game.     There have really only been a handful golfers over the years who win and have a lot of charm and personality  - Arnie, Seve Ballesteros, and Phil Mickelson come to mind."
sports,3e26dt,direwolf71,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:04:50 2015 UTC,Yep - this is good for Johnson but bad for the Tour and golf in general.  Golf needed Spieth to win - golf needs all the hype it can get.    Instead it got arguably the Tour's most boring player & personality possible.

Alex Morgan will only be on the American version of the cover and won't be seen in the rest of the world, but even so the inclusion of women's national teams is a massive step forward to legitimizing women's soccer. There are 12 women's teams in the game (all national teams), and they have motion captured female players and added a physics engine just for the women's side. I hate EA but I have to give them props for taking this step.  Some interesting facts about women's soccer:  1) There are almost more registered female soccer players in America than in the rest of the world combined.  2) America started the world's first womens professional soccer league in 2000. It folded after 3 years. Japan's women play in an amateur league.  3) The Women's World Cup only started in 1991, after the US lead a coalition in FIFA to create it. This year it wasn't even on real grass. Its still not even broadcast in the overwhelming majority of countries.  4) Canada got to host the women's World Cup because no other country wanted it.  5) For the last Women's World Cup, 93% of the total global TV viewership was from the USA.  6) Over 22.8 million Americans watched the women's world cup final. This is comparable to the World Series Finals (men's baseball) and NBA Finals (men's basketball). Nowhere else on the planet does women's soccer get even a quarter of this audience.  7) The current US women's team coach is from England, yet she never played soccer in England as there were no leagues. She came to the US and only started playing soccer there.   8) Women's soccer was banned in England until 1971. The Football Assocation claimed that ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females"".  9) The US women's player Alex Morgan earns over $3 million per year, and gets nationwide advertising campaigns and is a household name. Other players like Hope Solo, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm are also household names.  10) England's highest paid women's soccer player earns £65,000 per year, and she is the highest paid by far. The Japanese women that the US women's national team defeated in the final of the women's world cup are literally amateurs and all have a second job to support themselves.  11) The US Women's national team is considered by far the best women's soccer team in the world, yet the few times they have played against amateur boys high school, they have always lost. They lost 8-2 to an American Under 17 boys team in scrimmage. They lost 2-1 to a Under 15 boys team.   TL;DR: Norway's women national team on how women's soccer is seen"
sports,3dz3ek,linesreadlines,128,Mon Jul 20 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"The Japanese women that the US women's national team defeated in the final of the women's world cup are literally amateurs and all have a second job to support themselves.   A good number of the women in the NWSL aren't able to support themselves with the income they make from the league. The max salary is only $37,800 while the minimum salary is below $7,000 a season. The league has a host family program to allow players to live rent free in the cities where their team plays.

sports,3e2jh2,bwr09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"The batsmen in cricket will often stand out of his crease (Closer to the bowler) and the bowler releases after passing the wickets on run up (Again, closer), so it's probably pretty similar in practice."
sports,3e2jh2,Betamaxreturns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you  are being down voted because you are right   From wiki  > In cricket, the striker's end stumps and the bowling crease are 66 feet (20.12 m) apart. The popping creases are 4 feet (1.22 m) in front of the stumps and thus are 58 feet (17.7 m) apart. The bowler's release point could be perhaps 1 foot (0.30 m) beyond his popping crease. The batsman tends to ""take guard"" or ""block"" on the popping crease, i.e. he stands 4 feet (1.22 m) in front of his stumps. That nets to a typical distances of about 57 feet (17.4 m) between delivery point and bat. In baseball, the pitcher's release point could be about 55 feet (16.8 m) depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends to stand back or ""deep"" in the batter's box, to maximise his time to ""look the ball over"", up to 2 feet (0.61 m) farther from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman is similar in both sports."

sports,3e2mhv,CharadeUR,5,Tue Jul 21 15:12:31 2015 UTC,"baseball is definitely one of those sports where it's better to watch in person. there's usually a good atmosphere and the breaks between plays aren't as noticeable. most games you stand a chance of getting a souvenir as well. this applies for lower-level teams (AAA and under) as well. cheap prices, but still as fun."

sports,3e2mhv,twas_now,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"Most forms of racing aside from human running.  Motor sport races. Largely uneventful and with an annoying engine buzz. Far more reliant on engineering and design than on athleticism, compared to other sports. I'm not really into cars, which is a big factor. Highlights from motorbike races can be ok—seeing those tight turns where their kneepads are grazing the ground, for example. I think motorbike racers are more athletic than auto racers, since they're using their bodies a lot more to influence the vehicle. I'm not saying that auto racers are in poor condition; I know all motor sport racers need excellent stamina, alertness, and reaction times. Highlights of close-calls and crazy turns in rally racing can be exciting, too. These guys have nerves of steel, racing with so many spectators lining the road. I could appreciate highlight reels, but I would never watch a whole race.  Horse races. These animals are bred by wealthy owners specifically to run. It seems just as silly as watching dogs or pigs or rabbits racing. Though after American Pharoah won the Triple Crown, I watched some of his races. I was impressed by his power and I found it  pretty exciting.  Cycling races. Kind of boring overall, just seeing a clump of 100+ men going down a road. Largely tainted by PED scandals, too. Track cycling can be exciting."
sports,3e2mhv,SlinkyAstronaught,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"As someone who loves motorsport and who can have a good time watching horse racing and cycling, I think the main point is that things racing, no matter what they are, is thrilling for me. If you add in the fact that these things are very fast and very impressive, both on the physical side and on the mechanical side, you get something that I love. Yesterday I turned on the TV and found a car race featuring Lamborghini race cars. I didn't know any of the drivers, any of the teams, or even what championship they were racing in but just watching the drivers push their machines to the very limit and seeing which one was fastest was very exciting."

sports,3e2mhv,YouTypeTooSlow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:42 2015 UTC,I think a lot of that might just be due to the long grind of the NBA season.  Players get worn down.  From  what I've seen the playoffs have much higher intensity.  I just don't like how the media plays up the hype and focuses on individual match ups and stars more than the teams themselves.

sports,3e2mhv,wolfpackflyflinger95,3,Tue Jul 21 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"baseball.  Pretty darn boring even with all of the rules trying to limit the batters and pitchers time wasting antics.   Tried to watch the World Series a few years ago. They literally had the screen split into two. One screen watching the pitch and the other showing an interview with the current batting teams pitcher about why he loves baseball.   I actually probably hate golf more, just because of how popular it is compared to how exciting it is. When I am in my 50's, I will be sure to continue playing ice hockey and soccer and probably take up some sort of water sport like sailing."

It's a constant barrage of them trying to convince you that it's a faster, harder, more difficult, better sport than whatever sport you happen to prefer and that its athletes are tougher, stronger, more athletic people than the athletes in whatever sport you prefer.  We get it, you've got the little brother syndrome because you're not as popular as other sports here in the U.S., and you want to get more people into it. But holy Christ, all you ever do is make me not want to see another game ever."
sports,3e2mhv,TheSensation19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"As a hockey fan, I completely agree that the fans can be obnoxious. I don't know why they show disdain for any other sport or athlete, it's like they don't realize that other sports take as much skill as hockey. I think they may be too focused on the fact that hockey is the toughest sport to pick up for other athletes, but that's strictly due to the fact that other athletes haven't skated since they were 5. Also ESPN having little rights to air NHL events doesn't help their little brother mentality. But the fans aside, the sport really is incredibly fun to watch, and has a pretty good community if they aren't talking about other sports."
sports,3e2mhv,samspopguy,4,Tue Jul 21 14:32:42 2015 UTC,"Funny that you say this.  Because EVERY single big time football or baseball fan I know of loves to trash hockey and soccer, equally for no real reason besides that its on TV. They love to say that soccer has no goals. I was not aware that a sport needed goals to be exciting. Furthermore, baseball fans... really? Hockey and soccer not as exciting? I worked at Applebee's for 3 years, and all of the waiters would love to trash any sport outside of their favorites. Its what most extreme fans do. Now idc, I tried to watch baseball but I cant. My dads a big baseball fan, because of stats but I dont get it.   The truth is though, outside of their favorite leagues. How much do they really love the sport? Most people do not even play football or baseball. Most have no idea what happens outside of the league they watch. Most NFL fans, dont like NCAA and vice versa. They can care two shits about international growth and leagues. Especially baseball.   ESPN has 0 rights to air hockey games and I love this.  ESPN is a joke of a sports network these days. ESPN tried to get NHL contract but the truth is that they would not have done as good of a job as NBC has done. However, ESPN did sneak in to host the World Cup of Hockey this fall.   As a big time hockey fan. I love the sports of soccer and basketball. I like tuning into Field and Track events. Crossfit Games have been pretty cool. I love watching water polo, hand ball and I am starting to get into Rugby, especially 7s.   Baseball is too slow for me. Football has way too many stoppages and commercials. 11 minutes of actual playing time... a joke."
sports,3e2mhv,twas_now,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"I think what's appealing to the football and baseball fans is that the sports are great to watch with friends, or if you have a family. The constant breaks allow you to talk about what just happened, do chores, get food, or go to the bathroom, etc. If you try this during hockey or soccer, you'll probably miss something exciting."

sports,3e2c1l,Footballmyass,4,Tue Jul 21 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"The US didn't even compete in the first two IFAF tournaments, probably because we have an unfair advantage. Hell, we even gave our own team strict guidelines to make sure we didn't have a huge advantage when we did start competing. To play in the tournament, our players can't have any professional experience, must have graduated college, and can be no more than one year removed from school.   We aren't forcing American Football on the rest of the world. It is simply growing in popularity on its own, just like every other major sport in the world has done at some point. If there weren't an international interest in the NFL and NCAA football, games wouldn't be played in Europe. It's all about money, and you need fans to make money.  You don't have to like our game, but don't say we're forcing it on you, either. Other people like it. You don't. Solution: don't watch it."

If you followed any sports minus your own you would realize that American Football is gaining popularity all over the world. Also the U.S. didn't even compete in the first few years of the IFAF.

You'd need to be within a certain windspeed range, the water can't be too choppy, etc. Catamarans aren't terribly popular for some reason. I kinda like them, though I haven't had many chances to sail them. I understand that sometimes tacking can be a pain, and if you capsize you might be in trouble.   That being said, you can get most dinghies to go pretty fast by getting them to plane. Here's a Laser II doing it.

Historically only those with access to private boats were able to watch the races. The wing sail the boats are using is also a huge improvement as it allows them to not be at the mercy of the wind as much as they were in the past. This meant there were huge delays in the action, which is terrible for TV.  For the next finals though they've shrunk the size down to 48 feet. The AC48 while smaller is a lot more affordable to build (SF only had three boats competing because of the price).

The wind doesn't always have to be at their backs, but what happens is similar to putting your hand outside the window of a car on the highway. As they surpass the speed of the wind, they gain ""apparent wind"" - wind from their sheer speed which steadily clocks around to in front of the boat (the wind always seems to be coming from the direction you car is moving).  Thus they are almost always sailing upwind.  Tldr magic also I don't know it just happens"

sports,3dtrq7,lycanilovememes,65,Sun Jul 19 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"As a sometimes-competitive sailor maybe i can give some insight. These boats are are essentially some of the most high tech sailboats ever built. Trying to control a boat like that is like taking a go-cart frame and strapping a V12 for a Lamborghini on the back and bolting the gas pedal to the floor. You are in for a wild ride but people can, and do, die sailing these boats. The boat that was tilting over or ""heeling"" as it should be properly referred to, looks as if they ""fell off"" meaning turned away from the direction of the wind in order to avoid a collision. They should not have had to do this since the boat with the camera is overtaking from an upwind position and the downwind boat has right of way in this scenario. The clip is short but if this is indeed what happened the race committee would decide what to do after the race.   The downwind boat was in a very precarious position, you can capsize by falling off hard like that which would have likely destroyed the boat (costs millions of dollars and risks lives) but the alternative may have been a collision which would have been far worse. The boat was likely damaged/compromised in some way due to falling back so suddenly which would not have happened to a regular boat, but like I said earlier the forces that these boats have to withstand from those sails are enormous. When the boat levels itself it appears as if they managed to turn back up into the wind, spilling their sails and at the same time being overshadowed by the overtaking boat which stole their wind. Its lucky that this happened since catamarans are a bitch to capsize, and one with a solid sail like these ones would probably not be recoverable during the race and may even be a near total loss of equipment."

sports,3dtrq7,Grassyfilth,7,Sun Jul 19 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"My time to shine!   If there were an abundance of lines, you were most likely sailing a monohaul sailboat with a symmetrical spinnaker complete with down-haul, topping lift, sheet, guy, jib sheet, main sheet, main halyard, jib halyard, spinnaker halyard and potentially a pre-ran reefing line depending how anally safe your friend is.   Source: racing sailboats for 10 years now"
sports,3dtrq7,sonny_sailor,6,Sun Jul 19 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the twing lines.  And the outhaul, vang, backstay (sometimes dual backstay lines), cunningham, maybe a jib cunningham.  Main sheet might also have both a gross trim and a fine trim.  And you gotta have some dock lines if you are going to park it.  Also could have separate spinnaker sheets and guys if you are on a big enough boat."

sports,3dtrq7,colbymcclain,362,Sun Jul 19 16:25:56 2015 UTC,The red boat (team new zealand) was leading team USA when they made an error and almost flipped. This allowed the Americans to overtake their boat. While this occurred during during the 8th race (not the 19th and final race) it proved to be extremely costly for Team New Zealand as Team USA would later make a massive comeback to take the regatta 9-8 after being down 8-1. If not for this error it is likely that Team New Zealand would have won the cup.

It has always been a bit frantic, afterall, it is a race, but it just seemed more graceful & beautiful. I guess, I don't appreciate all the technology thrown at the sport."
sports,3dtrq7,cmperry51,8,Sun Jul 19 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Prefer monohulls myself. Nothing surpasses the mighty J-class boats in that respect. I felt the same way when skating took over X-C skiing; ugly but it gets you there faster.
sports,3dtrq7,steppedindogpoo,5,Sun Jul 19 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, the J-Class are awesome. I always felt the boats used should represent the boats we use. How many people own catamarans? They're ok for a jaunt into the bay, but they are not seaworthy. Rough seas chew up a catamaran or trimaran."
sports,3dtrq7,cmperry51,4,Sun Jul 19 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"My ""favourite"" catamaran story is about two guys who showed up at our yacht club boat launch with a Hobie cat. As they were unloading, a girl who was with the Coast Guard Auxiliary strolled over and suggested they might want to think twice, as the lake was quite rough. This was Lake Winnipeg, which has a shallow south basin and can develop a steep chop - 6 feet or so, with a 20-foot period, in winds above 10-15 kts. The guys said they just wanted to do a little ""wave jumping"". Our friend pointed out that all the boats were in harbour, none out on the lake. Several hours later there was a search-and-rescue callout. They picked up one of the guys alive, his friend wasn't as lucky. This was in the early '80s."
sports,3dtrq7,Qualades,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"No they don't. The sea will chew up an inshore-designed monohull just as much as an inshore cat/tri. All of the recent round-the-world records have been set in tris and they plough through storms just as, if not even more smoothly than monos."
sports,3dtrq7,steppedindogpoo,2,Sun Jul 19 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"My info may be dated. Technology building them has improved since I sailed on one. However, all in all I think the mono hull would still be a better choice. A mono has less stress points,less joints, more longevity. Plus, I am stubborn and don't easily change. Even if it sends me to the bottom of the sea."
sports,3dtrq7,Qualades,2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:11 2015 UTC,"Monos are certainly better for lasting a long time and do tend to have a longer race-worthy period; but, especially with recent R&D, multi-hulls aren't going to fall apart as soon as a wave hits it. There are cats at my club that are going on 15 years old and have only succumbed to general wear and tear that comes with regular use and open winter storage."

sports,3dtrq7,SirSourdough,6,Sun Jul 19 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"The America's Cup is something like the World Cup of competitive sailing. It has a lot of interesting history and used to be a decently important piece of international sporting competition when sailing was more popular. The footage is from the most recent Cup, which was sailed with boats that can do something like 50mph over the water.  The title refers to the desire of the people in the boat with the camera not wanting to make their boat fall over (which is both costly in terms of speed and dangerous) like the guys in the front boat nearly do."

sports,3dtrq7,cambr967,3,Sun Jul 19 21:16:57 2015 UTC,One person was killed and 2 others seriously injured when Artemis and Oracle boats capsized during practice for this event. Basically when the boat goes from 40kph or 25 mph to zero when capsizing unless your holding on you get catapulted either away into the ocean or in to the solid wing(main sail) or rigging and if your unconscious in the water the chances of survival are pretty shaky. Plus These boats can be going 70 kph or 40 mph so a helmet mounted intercom system maybe needed to communicate between the team in windy conditions.

Check this youtube clip  From wikipedia:   Day 5: September 14 Race eight brought Team New Zealand to the brink of disaster. Leading from the start to midway up the third leg, TNZ was tacking back to starboard to once again cover Oracle. However, a lack of hydraulic power at a crucial moment during the turn meant that the large wingsail did not move in time. The boat's starboard hull rose out of the water and Aotearoa came within a degree of capsizing.[54][55] To add insult to injury, Barker was penalised for failing to give way to Oracle who was on starboard tack at the time. Merely glad to have their boat in one piece, the Kiwis followed Spithill to the finish 52 seconds behind."

He had a 99.4 as his test batting average back in a time when test matches were played on poor wickets (pitches), all against top class opposition. To put it into perspective no other cricketer has an average above 63, and only 4 cricketers are above 60. A 55 or above and you're the batsman of that generation. A 45 or above and you're a normal top flight batsman. Only 10 runs separates the very good from the incredible, and Bradman was the sum of both.   This is in the second or third most played sport in the world (there's some debate on this). It's obscene. I'm not a huge follower of cricket, but always see the guy as number 1 on 'best athletic achievement' or 'best sportsman of all time' lists. Gretzky is probably the only guy who comes close."

Keep in mind that sharks have very good vision and could easily tell the difference between a surfboard/person and a seal.   “The thought that a white shark would mistake a 6 foot long skinny surfboard for a 1,400 pound elephant seal is highly unlikely.” - President of the Shark Research Committee, Ralph S.

The batter's wicket is put down (he's out) because the bail (the yellow stick that flies) is separated from the stumps when the ball goes through it.

sports,3dts1h,NikoNiii,17,Sun Jul 19 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"Sure! here it is again in slow motion from above  https://gfycat.com/ThisIdolizedLcont  Massialas on the right attacks Ota. Ota blocks the attack in 'sixte' actually it's 'second' I think, by pushing Massiaslas' blade away from his body outwards to his right side.  In foil, if you block/parry, and then both fencers hit each other, the person who parried gets the point. The idea being, he successfully defended, so he gets a turn to try to hit. So when Massialas' attack get's parried, he tries to defend Ota's follow up.  Also in foil, you have to hit with the point. There is a little button on the end that you have to press down on your opponent. You gotta hit the silver part (it's conductive lame material) to score.  So Ota defends and starts his turn (when you hit back after parrying it's called a riposte). He fakes to the chest, and Massialas tries to sweep the attack out of the way and twist his body out of the way so that he can't get hit. But Ota then brings his blade up and around to Massiaslas' back. He then puts enough force in the blade so that it bends a little bit, and the tip can be pressed down on Massiaslas back.  You can see Massialas realises it's happening and tries to pull his right elbow back, and twist the other way to obscure the target, but Ota is to fast, and is able to score before that happens.   Manipulating the blade like that is quite a figety thing, and it's hard to get across the amount of athleticism that you need to do what Ota did. You can't just put a lot of force into it, cus you'll miss (especially against Massiaslas, who is very squirmy).   If I had to describe it, I would say it's like running up to a pool table at full sprint with a cus in your hand, and smoothly transitioning to pocketing a ball. Usain bolt can get there faster than anyone, but would miss. Mark Selby wouldn't miss an easy pocket, but wouldn't get there in time. You need to do both, and you have enough focus so that while you're doing a fair amount of cardio, you can see your time to do it immediately without hesitating.  This is the World Championship final, and Ota ended up becoming the 2015 world men's foil champion by winning this bout."

Moving his hand to defend his chest, combined with twisting his torso to further defend his chest allowed his opponent (left) to successfully execute a risky move to score on the other's back. Also red is good."

Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins, must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage. (The American game has a similar ""neutral zone"" but it is only the width of the football.)   Canadian Football"

sports,3dtjhc,SnowdensOfYesteryear,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"Yes... 6 points + conversion (1 or 2 pts).  One thing to note is that the CFL clock is different when in the final 3 minutes of each half.  40 seconds is plenty of time to cause a turnover (or successful onside kick) and get one more good chance to take the lead back.   In the last three minutes of a half, the clock stops whenever the ball becomes dead. On kickoffs, the clock starts when the ball is first touched after the kick. On scrimmages, when it starts depends on what ended the previous play. The clock starts when the ball is ready for scrimmage except that it starts on the snap when on the previous play. -Wiki about Canadian Football   This and the 20 second play clock (compared to 40 seconds in NFL) makes it tougher for the Defense to simply run out the clock, as is common place in the NFL.  This is why one of the league's mottos is ""No Lead Is Safe""."

sports,3dqy9h,Ntghgthdgdcrtdtrk,0,Sat Jul 18 19:03:22 2015 UTC,"because you are your brain. if your brain considers itself female then you are female. you are not your body, so if sex and gender do not match the problem lies with your body, not your brain. that's why it's not a mental health issue and psychiatrists only recognize ""gender dysphoria"", i.e. the discontent that comes from not having matching sex & gender."

Fuck there's a girl who was a national champion swimmer who always identified as male, and she grew a pair (no pun intended) and went through an operation and now she's a dude swimming for the men's team at Harvard.  She took a plunge.  Bruce did not, and just did it for the media attention and money.  So now you're telling me he's just a dude who thinks he's a woman (and from the looks of things, can't simply look down and say ""hey, I guess I'm not a woman""), went through a whole ordeal to tell the world he's a woman (but he still has a dick) who still likes women?  And this means he gets an award named after a black guy who was a gentleman, a social activist and a champion in a traditionally white upper class sport during the civil rights movement?  In short, he goes from a dude that likes women to a chick with a dick that likes women to......?  A straight dude to a lesbian (?) she-male.

Hence transgender. You can identify as a woman and still be into women. What Caitlyn is going through is tough, something much tougher than you probably realize. Caitlyn is a high profile celebrity, and is standing for a movement that's very important. Trans women experience a disproportionately high amount of murder and assault.

I can't stand the Cubs or the Red Sox, but because it is baseball, I would enjoy watching these teams play my favorite sport, as opposed to another sport. Does that make sense to you?"
sports,3duyfe,Snoclaf67,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:50 2015 UTC,No.. sorry. I love football and I enjoy watching any team play but I wouldn't ever actually call myself a fan of more than one team.

sports,3duyfe,sweatybeard,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:48 2015 UTC,"It's okay when loyal fans that legitimately love their team say it. What bugs me is the bandwagon fans that only know 1 or 2 stars on their team say it. (Florida State, Alabama. I live in the south, and these are two teams that are horrible about it because of recent success)"

sports,3duyfe,OnTheTerlet,5,Mon Jul 20 00:20:53 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to say we if you A: are on the team. B: Have stock in the team. C. If it is college and you attend that college and actually put money into the school.    How is that any different from fans who paid through the nose for season tickets?  Some fans have been rooting for the same team all their life.  In this era of free agency, many players hardly spend 2 or 3 years with the same team.  I think these life-long fans have a more legit claim to the word ""we"" than some of these mercenary players."
sports,3duyfe,kiwirish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:13 2015 UTC,I buy that. That's a solid point I forgot about. Season ticket holders. It is sad that only a handful of players stay on a team for 5 years or more. I'm not sure about comparing a lifelong fan to a player that actually plays the sport though....interesting thought.

Coordination, balance, eye movement, quality of speech, content of speech, mood was unstable, everything was to the point that they could get around the house on their feet (not fully ""walk"") and vocalize words, but everything was operating at 20℅. All of this looked odd because the rest of their body was physically fine, just took a really hard hit to the head. It took 4-5 years before they got back to passing for ~normal, and just normally ""off."""

sports,3dnzmm,theshowstoppa34,3,Sat Jul 18 13:14:22 2015 UTC,"For those trying to figure out what happened, here's an amateur racing cyclists' 2 cents:   it was raining on a new pavement which we all know creates an oily film on the surface that is dangerous these race bikes are designed to go, not stop. When a wheel gets wet the rim brakes don't work very well. Rim brakes will easily brake lock your wheel. To slow down in dry conditions you gently touch your brakes, in wet conditions this won't slow you down at all. So sudden need to rapidly decelerate usually means a locked wheel due to grabbing brakes hard and they slide out of control like in this video. bonus info: many manufacturers have started offering disc brakes which are much safer and effective at braking without risk of locking your wheel, AND they work very well in wet conditions. The UCI (Union cycling Internationale) hasn't allowed disc brakes in pro racing, I'm not sure why. Many people use them at the recreational/amateur level."
sports,3dnzmm,FutureEnterpriser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the epic breakdown. Interesting note about disc brakes. I've had them for years on single track, downhill, and cyclocross bikes... yet never on a road bike. They perform better for sure.  Haven't looked at the weight difference in years and know it changes the weighting of the wheel. Would be curious to hear how that would impact a pro race like TdF."
sports,3dnzmm,edlll91,2,Sat Jul 18 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Other than the helmet, they're barely wearing any protection at all. I cringe when I see them go down. Roadrash is so painful and so many times it just looks like bad timing and impossible to avoid."

sports,3dm8qa,animus_hacker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Since the NFL is the only one that has the right to broadcast or use it, they have all of the leverage. So it could sit in his hands as just a tape (possibly a collector would buy it, but not likely for as much as the NFL offered) OR it could sit in NFL's hands and produce a large amount of money. It sucks, but I think the longer he holds out the better it works out for him. The older these kinds of things get, the more antique and valuable they become.  EDIT: I could actually see some die hard wealthy fans dropping a shit ton of money on it."

sports,3dm8qa,baraksobamas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"The fact that no one has seen footage of this in ~50 years would make it a TV ""event"" - especially considering how popular the Super Bowl has become.   The NFL could translate this into a TV special, with analysts, sports writers, old athletes, etc. Young football fans would watch because of its buzz, old people would watch for the nostalgia.   So, the NFL making 10-20 million in revenue from this footage is reasonable.   I believe him asking for 2 million is more than fair."

The inclusion of civilian property was seen as a mistreatment of the civilian population and considered a violation of the laws of war (by the British), this happened again shortly after in the raid on Port Dover.  This arson/raiding happened mainly as an act of revenge by the soldiers for the timed explosion of Fort York that wounded and crippled the American force (first use of this tactic in military history I believe).    In retaliation for these two events, in 1814 the town of Washington was captured and occupied by the British and many buildings were burnt including the presidential mansion and the capitol.  Some soldiers committed the same looting and theft of civilian properties, against direct order, and were later punished for this by their superiors.  The sandstone walls of the mansion and the capitol stood (albeit now scorched) but all timbers burned.  In an effort to not have the capital city moved, Washington business men bankrolled the rebuilding efforts and the presidential mansion was rebuilt, repainted and re branded as the White House."

Just to simply say yeah those are shitty people but didn't mean everyone is. To a lot of Mexicans soccer is one of the few thing the people have going for them. So soccer is one of the most held treasures to them, and that passion and love for the have can sometimes cause people to act irrational especially under the influence of alcohol. I will admit that Mexican fans do this more than others but don't hate a nation for what drunk fans do. There are many other Mexicans that feel the same as you and I believe that those who do such as actions should be punished. I hope this helps stop the idea that all Mexicans are shitty people."

Oh wait...   He could be blamed for the Lakers' losing as well.  But in context, maybe you're right - winning was always the most important thing to him. It's just that he's not looking for his team to win but rather himself to win:    One anonymous ""source close to Lakers decision makers"" told Abbott:  ""He wants to win. But only as long as he's the reason we're winning, as long as the performance is not affecting his numbers. No one works harder than Kobe. And no one sabotages his own efforts more. He's scaring off the free agents we're trying to get. We're trying to surround you with talent and your ego is getting in the way.""   I won't fault him for taking the money even though it screwed over his team for years, as that's what a lot of us would do - it's a job after all, though in an entirely different context and on a different level of pay.

Things like this are more socially acceptable now because a lot of people are more open minded now then they were back in the 80s. From what he says he felt like this for a very long time. If he were to have done something like this when he started feeling this way rather than later and fought for this cause for 20 years then yeah absolutely. I think his actions have inspired other transgender people and that is great but I think of how many lives he could have saved if he had done something like this earlier in life and been an advocate for it to show people that it is okay to do your thing and be who you want to be. I respect him for what he has done thus far but in my opinion he could have done this way earlier.

So I would go with the NFL and pick five guys who are either incredibly athletic QBs, or guys who are wide receivers that were QBs in college.  I'd pick Michael Vick, Colin Kapernick, Russell Wilson, Julian Edelman, and Joshua Cribbs.   Vick, Wilson, and Kapernick all have great arms as they are NFL QBs and they are all mobile QBs.  Vick and Kapernick have blazing speed and rocket arms.  Wilson is slower but more agile, but he is also an MLB prospect infielder, so he has great and quick hands.  Edelman and Cribbs were both quarterbacks in college (coincidentally both at Kent State).  By virtue of being college QBs, they have strong arms for dodgeball.  But they are also incredibly athletic.  Edelman is a smaller target for being hit, and he is one of the best slot receivers in the game and has fantastic hands.   He is also one of the best punt returners of all-time.   Cribbs is one of the best kick returners of all-time (most KR touchdowns).

Samoa nearly beat the All Blacks last weekend.   I know the Australian team for the American football world cup are made up of players that started playing a couple of years ago and even some of the players play a game of social rugby and football each weekend. No one really takes it seriously outside the US and Canada."
sports,3dgnsm,peteav,41,Thu Jul 16 08:12:50 2015 UTC,Fellow rugby fan here. Couldn't agree more.
sports,3dgnsm,pmmecodeproblems,36,Thu Jul 16 08:38:16 2015 UTC,"There is about eight teams that could realistically win the rugby world cup (more than the soccer world cup)   Statistically speaking, this isn't really true. Since the 1987 Rugby World Cup (7 tournaments), there have been 8 teams that reached the semi-finals (6 of which have reached the semis more than once), while since the 1990 FIFA World Cup (7 tournaments) there have been 15 teams that have reached the semi-finals (6 of which have reached the semis more than once). If we look back and include quarter-finalists, there have been 12 quarter-finalists in the Rugby World Cup since 1987, and 28 quarter-finalists in the FIFA World Cup since 1990.  As for teams that have actually achieved victory, there have been 4 countries (New Zealand, Australia, England, South Africa) that have won the Rugby World Cup since the original 1987 tournament. Since the 1990 FIFA World Cup, there have been 5 countries (Germany, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain) that have won the world cup.  Looking purely at world cup finals, there have been 5 countries (the four winners and France) that have reached the Rugby World Cup final since 1987, and 7 countries (Argentina, Germany, Italy, Brazil, France, Spain, Netherlands) that have reached the FIFA World Cup Final since 1990.  Looking at recent/current tournaments, the current favorites for the 2015 Rugby World Cup are New Zealand, England, South Africa, Australia, and Ireland. It's difficult to look past any of those 5 teams and all of them are a constant presence in previous tournaments, while the other 3 teams that round out the top eight (France, Wales, Argentina) are more sporadic fringe teams that rarely reach the final four and have never won it. With the most recent FIFA World Cup (2014), there were around twelve countries that were favored - the eight former champions (Brazil, Germany, Italy, France, Argentina, Spain, England, Uruguay) along with Belgium, Colombia, Netherlands, and Portugal.  I'm a fan of both rugby and soccer but I'm going to keep the facts grounded here, and speaking of facts I certainly won't be letting in any the hype for my country (Australia) as we could be doomed for a group stage exit this year considering that (just like the FIFA World Cup last year) we're in the horrible group of death for the 2015 Rugby World Cup and I suspect that England and either Wales or Fiji will edge us out and advance ahead of us. Here's hoping I'm wrong about one of these things."
sports,3dgnsm,SerSilence,10,Thu Jul 16 13:23:15 2015 UTC,"Wales and France are certainly not ""sporadic, fringe teams"". They are more than capable of winning the World Cup. Wales has won the home/five/six nations more than any other country, and won the six nations in 2013. France won the six nations a few years before and they have both got grand slams in recent years (if my memory is correct, more recently than England and Ireland). France were World Cup finalists in 2011 and were very unlucky not to win, they were better than the All Blacks in that game, and they made the semis in 2007 by beating the All Blacks. And if you place a bet on either you won't get much money out of the bookies, they think they are a chance. As for Argentina, considering their performances in the Rugby Championship in recent years, especially their performances against SA and Australia, it is not out of the question that they could win. If you think Uruguay could win, Argentina deserves to be considered as a potential rugby World Cup winner."

One of the real problems in France is that the sport is not mediatised enough and players are not paid except in 2 teams. Which is exactly why there are 2 teams at the top of the 1st division and there's others teams. And btw, before you all ask, we have 3 national divisions and then some regional divisions.  We also have a small amount of ex NCAA players coming in France to play football when they failed to get signed by one of american teams.  Overall the level is not that bad, they have mostly some decent skills to throw the ball, catch it, run it, etc (on USA scale of course). The major difference is that in France, juice isn't allowed to go the gym, and we overall weigh less which is a major problem when you're facing a team where wide receivers weigh the same as your mlb."

They tasted defeat early on at the hands of Team Iceland. That loss forced them to learn and adapt. Through an intensive training montage they were able to overcome social stigmas as well as Team Iceland. That is why they are THE champions.

sports,3dgnsm,The_Tic-Tac_Kid,115,Thu Jul 16 05:23:20 2015 UTC,It would be far more than 100-0. The USA team is basically a really bad college team in terms of player skill. A bad NFL team would beat a good college team about 100-0. A good NFL team would probably beat these teams by several hundred points. JJ Watt or Justin Houston against these O-lines would be hilarious to watch. Rob Gronkowski could probably carry the entire defensive unit of the other team into the endzone. Darrelle Revis would laugh at QBs who threw directly into his arms. Aaron Rogers would absolutely devastate any defensive plans they had. An All-Pro NFL team would easily score 500 points if the time allowed.

You could not throw at an all-pro NFL defensive roster if you're at the levels these guys are, so you'd be forced to run. Good luck running against 250-350lb guys who can probably run just as fast as you can. If the Patriots can beat the Titans 59-0... With 45 points in ONE QUARTER against an actual NFL team. An ALL-PRO NFL team could beat any of these teams several hundred points to zero easily."

Boys usually choose football in the fall and either basketball or weightlifting in the spring. Girls either stick with soccer or do cheerleading in the fall and volleyball in the spring.   In highschool you have a whole mess of sports like Archery, Softball, Baseball, Basketball, Football, Wrestling, Swimming, Soccer, Track and Field, Cross Country, Marching Band, Boxing, Gymnastics, Dance, Cheerleading, Volleyball, Hockey, and Weightlifting. Often times students will play multiple sports so each is well populated.   The US isn't so singleminded as you might think."

sports,3dib34,ScorpionsSpear,7,Thu Jul 16 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Between Cowherd, Simmons, and Olbermann ESPN has lost a lot of what made them interesting. Those guys were never afraid to give their opinion, even if it ruffled a few feathers. Seems like ESPN just wants a bunch of ""yes"" men/women doing their reporting (read: top-brass determined narrative creating)."
sports,3dib34,hampsted,-2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:43 2015 UTC,What's the difference between Cowherd (gone) and Bayless and Stephen A. Smith (still there)?

sports,3dib34,mhallgren5,11,Thu Jul 16 15:12:03 2015 UTC,he's extremely good at what he does   So is Skip Bayless. That doesn't mean what he's good at is worth watching or listening to.
sports,3dib34,Nerdlinger,6,Thu Jul 16 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"Because it's not hard at all to play the antagonist.  ESPN can hire plenty of local hack TV sportscasters, throw the ESPN marketing machine behind them, and create the next ""controversial"" personality.      Sports personalities like Bill Simmons are rare and hard to find.  You don't have to look far to find another Skip/Stephen A./Colin/Olbermann guy."
sports,3dib34,KanyeExcuse,2,Thu Jul 16 19:27:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Colin's show is significantly worse whenever anyone fills in for him. He's far less of a troll than Bayless, too. Being controversial doesn't have to mean saying things that have no basis in reality as Skip does. I think the majority of Cowherd's points are defensible or at least debatable. People usually justify calling him a troll based on that one John Wall incident and less than a handful of others."

They're taking a pretty big hit this summer, this is bad whether your a fan of Colin Cowherd or not. Quality will definitely drop losing him.."

Wonder if Colin saw this coming."
sports,3dib34,diplomonad1,3,Thu Jul 16 17:01:00 2015 UTC,He probably did. They like athletes have contract negotiations and he probably knew ESPN wouldnt come up on their offer to keep him

Over time, this was one of the main reasons that I began to really like Colin actually. He said what he wanted to say, and even if I didn't agree with it I listened. That is his job afterall! He had a way to make arguments that were both interesting and engaging, like him or not.  This is a loss for ESPN, as are many of their recent moves over the last couple of months. Colin will bring many of his listeners to FOX or wherever it is he ultimately ends up."

sports,3dib34,SnapHook,-6,Thu Jul 16 15:15:14 2015 UTC,ESPN can't afford him anymore   Are you joking? Being in high demand in AM radio is like being the prettiest girl in the burn ward.
sports,3dib34,InvaderChin,7,Thu Jul 16 15:58:40 2015 UTC,"The difference here was that ESPN did make an aggressive bid to keep Cowherd, but was upstaged by Fox, who are clearly looking to make a big splash.   From the article."
sports,3dib34,SnapHook,-11,Thu Jul 16 16:02:33 2015 UTC,"Again. How are you making a big splash in AM radio? Reddit has a broader reach than AM radio.  No one cares who brings them sports news as long as they don't suck (see: Stephen A. Smith). Cowherd's a name that's only valuable to Board members at Fox who are out of touch with how people actually live their lives in relation to sports and think that he's a ""big draw"". The reality is, you could swap a guy named PeanutButter McGee into Cowherd's spot at ESPN and about half of the viewership wouldn't even notice."
sports,3dib34,InvaderChin,5,Thu Jul 16 16:08:56 2015 UTC,Am radio is huge. Sports radio is huge. Not sure why you're downplaying it. Plus you get an easy / cheap to produce 3 hour block of TV.   Also you can't plug random people in. Each radio host has a culture and rabid fans that will follow. Dumb to ignore that.
sports,3dib34,derpaderp1,-7,Thu Jul 16 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, you're right. There are literally dozens of rabid fans that crowd around the radio to drink beer and listen to Colin fucking Cowherd on AM radio.   Netflix? Podcasts? Flashes in the pan. AM radio is here to stay, jack!"

Do you think when Pat Summitt won the award in 2012, there were a bunch of people who boycott the awards or wrote nasty things online becuase the award didn't go to a soldier or a cancer patient? Of course not.  The truth is, the ESPY's have always been contrived; they've always been for PR. Athletes already get team and individual trophies in their own sport, why do we need to invent an award show just to give them more?  But they raise a lot of money for the Jimmy V foundation, which helps a ton of people. And they recognize people who aren't afraid to take an unpopular stand or who have overcome overwhelming odds.  What's really sad to me is the idea that I have to choose between celebrating the bravery of a wounded veteran/cancer/ALS patient and the bravery of Caitlyn Jenner. Why am I not allow to think that what she's doing takes courage while also celebrating the lives of people like Pete Frates, Stuart Scott, ect...?"

The dude had arguably one of the best championship performances in NBA history. People were actually saying shit like ""LeBron has superstars like Dellavedova and JR Smith""  That translates to ""It's is all Lebron"". They shoudl be renamed the Cleveland LeBrons. He was the only person steadily contributing. When Delly had a decent game, the Cavs won. When LBJ had just a glimmer of help, the Cavs won.   I'm not even a Cavs fan (Geaux Pels) but fuck that. LBJ was by far the most dominant player for either team and more dominant than any other athlete in any championship this year and it wasn't even close."

If you've ever played basketball (as a shooter) you'd know that shooting is as much about finding a rhythm as it is about skill. If you're only touching the ball whenever Lebonner can't get open after running the clock down the pressure to make that shot is that much greater on top of rarely getting to take shots.   I do think those guys should be able to live up to that pressure in the NBA, especially the finals but, everyone riding Lebron's shaft saying it was all him need to go away... he tried to carry the team on his back and never gave his teammates a chance to prove themselves. Yet, the media love Lebron and will always give him a nice out when he doesn't win a championship."

You are witnessing one of the most dominant athletes of all time and you hate it because it's the ""cool"" thing to do.   I enjoy watching LBJ more than any other player and he plays better than any other player. I don't think it is even close.

Nor am I saying the dude isn't incredibly talented. I think Lebron as a person isn't too bad. Lebron as a basketball player, bouncing around to win championship. Coming home because it was time ahem ""I'll go if you go KLove"" ahem Kyrie. ahem  The dude loves to stack the deck in his favor and despite doing it in Miami he still lost half the championships he got to.  Another thing that bother me about Lebron... well mainly about the media and fanboys is that when Lebron and Co. loses it's Lebron's teams fault. And when Lebron and Co. win it's because of Lebron. So his supporting cast gets no credit. So I guess that's not really a problem I have with Lebron more a problem I have with the media and mega fanboys."

I get that they want to bring in more viewers which is why they even had to say his name when giving her the award which was pretty lame. If Mayweather faced anyone not named Manny Pacquiao this year then I wouldn't even say anything, but he beat a 1st ballot hall of fame fighter, and sold and broke his previous record  doing over 4 million buys, and made like $300 million in 1 night. What fighter had a better year than that?   Not trying to discredit her, but this is the one year he definitely should have won. Most people don't even know the names of the women she is fighting, and if she is beating them that fast how good are they really? Honestly I don't watch much mma these days has she ever faced an undefeated fighter? Who is the best fighter she has faced and why?

I wouldn't have even really cared if they didn't mention him.  It just seemed a bit orchestrated to me like they did to just get head lines.  He already won it in  (2007, ’08, ’10, ’12, ’13, 14), so I guess they had to give someone else a chance.  I just think Floyd had a better year this year than last year."

But it seems like you're trying to somehow compare Ronda Rousey to Hope Solo? Don't criticize Rousey for calling out Mayweather just because the media has a double standard in praising Hope Solo.

Simply stated that when conducting an interview about a sporting event that just took place they generally talk about the event.

I'm not downplaying his actions whatsoever. In fact, I never mentioned his actions outside of being interviewed."

You have to know what to do to once you clinch. A referee isn't going to break it up. You don't get extra points for weak jabs. A counter punch doesn't work on the ground.  If a wrestler gets a boxer on the ground, the wrestler usually wins. Most real fights end up on the ground, which obviously isn't going to happen in a boxing match. If Floyd Mayweather tried to clinch a judo specialist, he would land on his head very fast. If he tried to dodge someone grabbing him, it wouldn't be nearly as successful as it would be against a boxer.   Mayweather easily wins this fight using boxing rules. I'm not so sure he does using MMA rules."

sports,3dgu7a,I_dont_bone_goats,6,Thu Jul 16 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"MMA has taught us very convincingly what happens when a boxer with no grappling or mma experience fights in MMA. They get taken to the ground and submitted easily. Royce Gracie vs Art Jimerson, Randy couture vs James Toney, etc... Ronda is an olympic medalist in Judo and tosses larger and well trained men to the ground with ease in training. If Ronda manages to get a hold of Floyd, he's going down, no question.  Floyd would have to ko her with his first shot. I think Ronda would stay out of range, shoot in from very far, very low, below striking range, grab his ankles, toss him to the ground, and submit him in short order. It took a 47 year old couture 15 seconds to get Toney to the ground and I think this fight would be very similar. I get that Toney and Mayweather are different boxers, but if this fight ever happened, which it won't, I'd be confident that Ronda would win in the first round, probably first minute   Rousey's thoughts on this topic  Couture vs Toney"

Every MMA .vs. Boxing fight though the boxer gets next to no punches off because they don't know how to counter a takedown (you need a sprawl or a knee to the head which takes years of training to get into muscle memory for the lighting quick takedown attempts).

sports,3dgu7a,BombSquad123,6,Thu Jul 16 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind,   Rhonda fights with 4oz gloves. Floyd fights with 10oz gloves.  Floyd is still faster with gloves drastically heavier than hers. Put him in 4 oz ones, and his hits would devestate her body and guard. Literally, she wouldn't be able to block, only deflect.   Floyd is insanely faster and stronger than her, has a half foot longer reach, and he has been taking hits stronger than hers since he was a young teenager.  Technique is more noticeable in the lower weight classes and women's fighting because muscle isn't used as much. The heavier you go, the less your body can take.  Floyd is a master of technique, and now he's fighting someone who can't defend against any of his attacks."

sports,3dgu7a,NeedHelpWithExcel,3,Thu Jul 16 18:14:45 2015 UTC,"In 99/100 cases I would absolutely agree. I just am trying to consider whether or not Floyd could simply out-power every aspect of mixed martial arts technique simply because he is a man. The only MMA discipline Floyd knows to my knowledge is boxing, so there are a lot of uncovered bases there. He is an inch taller than Ronda with only a slight weight advantage (if they fought it at a 135 lightweight it would be Ronda's fighting weight), so I am not so sure. I said that I felt like Floyd would have a better shot in an MMA fight than Ronda in a boxing ring because that is definitely the case based on sport and genetic differences alone. I just think Ronda would eventually be able to find an upper hand in an MMA bout."
sports,3dgu7a,BombSquad123,5,Thu Jul 16 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"You make very valid points, and of course this entire conversation is 100% speculation since this fight will likely never happen. However:  I honestly believe that even in a UFC ring Floyd would be able to completely out power Ronda. Just imagine if Floyd and Ronda were to arm wrestle. He'd probably break her hand slamming it to the table."

His rookie season in Formula 1 started with 9 podiums in a row, took 4 wins for the year and lost the championship to Kimi Raikkonen by only a single point (as did Fernando Alonso).  A famous DNF in China where he destroyed his tyres showed that he was indeed a rookie and made rookie mistakes - many say this cost him the championship.  The next season he went one better and won the WDC by a single point from Felipe Massa.  But Massa had the championship sewn up for half a lap, when Lewis passed Timo Glock in the rain at the final corner of the race to take 6th and get the points he needed to win.  The amount of hype surrounding Hamilton during his rise to F1 WDC was immense, and I don't remember anyone being hyped as much as he was."

For years, he has been preaching Aryan superiority and the Olympics brought about the apex of his propaganda.  Just two months earlier, German boxing champ Max Schmelling beat African-American Joe Louis in a sold-out Yankee Stadium to further add to Hitler's boasts.    These Olympics were to be the showcase and coronation of the Aryan race and Hitler initially tried to forbid all Jews and Blacks from participating.  When countries like the US threatened to boycott the Games, Hitler relented and even said Jews could compete on the German team (though in reality, Hitler allowed only one token Jewish woman to participate); Germany even removed the signs saying that Jews were not welcome near the stadia, though propaganda was everywhere.   Despite much protestation and concern, the games went on as planned.  Although Germany would go on to win the most medals in the Games, there is one lasting memory that stands above all: when a soon-to-be 23 year-old African-American from Ohio by way of Alabama entered the track and field arena in the heart of Nazi Germany and won four gold medals, winning the 100m, the 200m, the long jump, and the 4x100 relay.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quQopJmQry4"

sports,3dgrry,onoku,21,Sat Jul 18 10:27:45 2015 UTC,"Let me get this out of the way, right off the rip: I'm a former Corpsman. FMF. Spent a lot of my time treating wounded Sailors, Marines, Soldiers, Airman and civilians. My older brother was Army, and was KIA overseas after I left the Fleet.  With that said, Caitlyn Jenner has shown immeasurable courage with her personal life being placed in the public eye as it has been. This country, and indeed the world, is filled with hateful people. So yeah, she's shown some courage.  On the flip side, and this is the major thing why I disagree with her receiving the award, is that as courageous she has been, the issues she faces are nothing compared to what, in my opinion, the rightful honoree has to deal with.  Noah Galloway is an Iraqi War Veteran. A double amputee. In an era where 22 Veterans take their own lives EVERY DAY, Noah has refused to play the hand he's been dealt, and continues to show immeasurable strength, courage, and commitment to his Brothers and Sisters.   While both serve as inspirations to their respective communities, the issues facing the transgender community are slowly but surely getting better. I'm in no way diminishing the hatred, misogyny, and general shitty treatment the transgender (as well as the entire LGBT community) receive. I am, however, saying that the overall culture is shifting to be more and more accepting of them.   On the other hand, we Veterans are still treated as lepers. When people find out you're a Vet, they instantly ask if you've ever killed anyone. Or if you saw any of your friends die. Or if you have PTSD. When you say yes to any of those questions, people tend to shy away from you. They think you're dangerous. And speaking of PTSD, the help available to the Veteran community is woefully lacking. Take it from someone that the VA could not get to. The system is over-taxed, under-funded, and (no offense intended to the quality providers at the VA) inadequately staffed to handle the numbers of men and women coming home with issues from their time in service to their country.  Regardless, I'm happy for Caitlyn Jenner. She's a brave woman. In the end, though, Noah knows he's got courage. We all know it. And just like a true Soldier, he doesn't seek recognition for his deeds. He's a humble man, who will continue to serve as a motivator for those of us dealing with our own struggles. And he'll do it tirelessly, until his last breath.  Godspeed, Noah. Keep kicking ass."
sports,3dgrry,hotelcharlie22,13,Thu Jul 16 04:28:47 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, we Veterans are still treated as lepers.   Come on.  I agree with you on issues with the VA and all that. I think it's deeply wrong to send people to war and to give them less than the best care afterward. It's embarrassing. But how long has it been since a soldier got an award for being courageous? Has it been 24 hours? On the other hand from the shitty care from Veterans, you've got a huge war hero fetish in the US. Yeah, the same people who ""honor"" the troops will shrug at PTSD, but at least you're getting some recognition. At least you can bring up your problems without being ridiculed and told you've made it all up.  If left up to a public vote, a transgender person would never be recognized for their courage. It would be a soldier every time. Even if we went a generation without war (yeah, haha) as long as a soldier is still alive somewhere, that man or woman would be seen to be inherently more deserving of recognition. Is it possible that acknowledging the courage of trans people in general (beyond Jenner herself) is worthy of one award? It's just one (crappy ESPY) award in the history of awards. Is that too much? They should ALL go to soldiers? Noah Galloway isn't the first veteran amputee. He's just one that has also become a reality TV darling. He's a pop-culture commodity. Giving an award to him would be like honoring a stand in for all veterans. Do veterans need another courage award from ESPN in order to know their bravery is seen by society?"

Noah had to learn how to walk all over again. How to dress himself. How to do day to day tasks that you, and I, and even Caitlyn Jenner take for granted. It's hard enough for a completely healthy Veteran to come home and deal with PTSD, let alone when that struggle is complicated with physical disability.  If I really wanted to be a dick and throw a Veteran out there who did nothing more than become a woman, just to compare evenly to Jenner, I'd throw out Kristin Beck. Former Navy SEAL. Best of the best, kind of guy, becomes best of the best kind of woman. She happens to be an awesome woman, and it was my pleasure to know her both before and after her gender reassignment. But the thing with that comparro is that neither of them should be eligible for the Arthur Ashe. Neither of them have any relevance to sports. Sure, Jenner was a ridiculously talented athlete in her time, but her relevance to sports is non-existent. Same with Beck. She's a hell of a warrior, but she's not exactly a sports figure in modern times.  All in all, I am not supporting Noah Galloway simply because he's a Vet. I'm supporting him because, even as a non-Veteran double amputee, he would be more deserving than Caitlyn Jenner. That's all.  Sidenote: I really recommend picking up a copy of Kristin Beck's book Warrior Princess. Talk about a tale of true courage, albeit not related to sports. Kristin, you are a true DEVGRU Diva."

It's hard enough for a completely healthy Veteran to come home and deal with PTSD, let alone when that struggle is complicated with physical disability.   I agree that it's impressive. I think he does receive plenty of deserving acknowledgement for his persistence, as do many other people like him.    Sure, Jenner was a ridiculously talented athlete in her time, but her relevance to sports is non-existent.   So Galloway runs marathons now and that makes him more related to sports than the star of the 1976 Olympic Games - the person hailed as the greatest athlete on earth for a time? They gave this same award to Nelson Mandela. They gave it to Muhammad Ali and Billie Jean King decades after they retired.   All in all, I am not supporting Noah Galloway simply because he's a Vet. I'm supporting him because, even as a non-Veteran double amputee, he would be more deserving than Caitlyn Jenner. That's all.   The only reason most people are talking about Noah Galloway is that some right-wing blogger dude wrote a post that went viral ranting about this. Galloway was not a ""runner up"". He's the same as the other 7 billion people who did not win the award. Some right wing dude was just salty about an LGBT person receiving a mainstream honor. I am quite sure that Noah Galloway is not literally the most courageous person in the world. The point of this award is not to choose the bravest person, objectively, each year. The point is to honor someone who is courageous. ESPN shone a spotlight on not just a person, but on people who are never honored for their courage. There is still plenty of acknowledgement to go around for Galloway and men and women like him who have thrived in the face of great difficulty. Those guys are routinely honored and respected.   You see, if this thing didn't have such a virulent backlash to it, this could have a real positive effect. Trans people are often fucking terrified to come out. Transitioning is trading an internal struggle for an external one and many people suffer for years smothering themselves in private turmoil in order to not to make that trade. Making that trade, though, has a measurable positive effect on mental health despite the rocky road of public opinion. Having a mainstream acknowledgement of the courage it takes could do so much good. If it makes some people feel like maybe not the entire world will be against them, then giving this award to Jenner will have done some good. Coming out and being yourself shouldn't have to be courageous. But right now it takes courage for people to help themselves, and closeted trans people only ever receive signals from mainstream culture that they should stay in the closet.   Is it not OK to take this one moment to say that trans people can be courageous, too? Is that too much to ask? We have to go back to honoring the only type of person that is already steeped in praise and adoration, because trans people don't live up to mainstream standards of bravery? Hell, the fact that this is deeply unpopular is kind of the point. This chorus of voices is showing exactly why it's a good thing that someone mainstream took 30 minutes of one night to acknowledge transgender struggles. It's not the magnitude of their courage. It's the complete deficit of acknowledgement of the courage many trans people do have (and desperately need)."
sports,3dgrry,IsupportLGBT_nohomo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"At what point, in any of my posts, have I not said that Caitlyn is courageous? Or Kristin Beck. For fuck's sake. I'm not taking anything away from Caitlyn at all, only saying that Noah is far more deserving, given the struggles he has to overcome on a daily basis.  Caitlyn has no physical impairments. Has been supported by the vast majority of people (save for the bitter, hateful assholes that will exist no matter how far we progress). Has a ridiculous amount of financial gain coming over the next several years. Is the decision to get gender reassignment surgery after coming out as a transgender individual a courageous one? Yes. Is her decision to put her whole life on display for public consumption a courageous one? Meh. That's up for interpretation. Exploiting it for financial gain cheapens it for me (but, that's just my opinion).  On the flip, despite ridiculous physical disability brought on by the traumatic amputation of two limbs, Noah Galloway has excelled in some of the most grueling athletic challenges. Hell, the dude competed in the 58 hour long Death Race. A race so grueling and challenging, that most ABLE BODIED athletes couldn't hack it. He consistently surpasses able bodied athletes in the Crossfit Games. He's finished marathons. All while dealing with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You know, the cause of 22 suicides per day.  Noah has risen above both the physical and mental handicaps that fate dealt him. Rather than allowing himself to wallow in the bottom of a bottle, letting his mind and body falter, watching his family fall apart, he's chosen to continue as a fighter. Adversity is what we do. We're taught to embrace the suck. Noah's avenue for dealing with his challenge was to seek outlet in sports, and to not just be better than other amputees, but to put able bodied athletes to shame as well.  While I fully support Caitlyn, and (I say it YET A-fucking-GAIN) I applaud her courage, I do not feel she is more deserving than Noah Galloway. Jenner was a brilliant athlete 40 years ago. Noah is not just a brilliant athlete now, but has shown immeasurable strength and courage as he continues to rise to any and all challenges put before him. I'm also pretty sure that it's a bit easier to put a very personal decision and situation in the public view when you stand to make millions of dollars.  You want a true hero for the transgender men and women out there? Kristin Beck. Former Navy SEAL with literally the best of the best of the Special Operations world. She was a SEAL for 20 years, including time with DEVGRU (Team Six, for those who don't know). Kristin is an awesome woman, was an amazing SEAL, and is an all around hero for all, not just the transgender community. If it weren't for the pressing of a psychologist from Georgetown for an interview, Kristin may have never had her story told outside of the the Special Warfare community. Coming out to a group of the roughest, hardest-fighting, trigger-pullers on the planet takes some serious chutzpah. And no one even batted an eyelash. Kristin is still a badass."

Exploiting it for financial gain cheapens it for me (but, that's just my opinion).   I, too, find the whole reality television angle to be rather cheap. I'd rather her not be the one trans person that gets all sorts of attention. She isn't representative. Though, she does have enough money to have moved to any country in the world and transitioned in private, probably without anyone knowing where she went. So she has, at least, chosen a harder path and I could give her the benefit of the doubt that it's not for selfish reasons and that it will benefit others.   While I fully support Caitlyn, and (I say it YET A-fucking-GAIN) I applaud her courage, I do not feel she is more deserving than Noah Galloway.   You're completely missing the point. I'm trying to point out that this isn't ""Caitlyn Jenner v Noah Galloway COURAGE death match!!!!11!!1"". It's not even trans people vs amputees. If society decides what type of person is courageous above all others, and then only give awards to those people, there will never ever be acknowledgement of the courage that some transgender people have, or any other type of courage. This is about honoring all kinds of people and all kinds of courage, not just picking amputee/cancer survivor of the year. Physical struggle isn't the only struggle. Mortality isn't the only fear that takes courage to overcome. By your standard, nobody would EVER acknowledge any other type of courage.   I'm also pretty sure that it's a bit easier to put a very personal decision and situation in the public view when you stand to make millions of dollars.   I wouldn't be so sure. I wouldn't trade places with her. You know how many people I'd like to know about my transition? None. I'd like for it to not be a thing I'm known for at all. It's in my past and I've never ever experienced anything good from someone knowing about it. Being paid more millions when I already have millions wouldn't factor into it. I'd have disappeared with the money I had if I were her.  This is the kind of shit that's all over social media every time she is brought up. Right now my local newspaper's facebook page is 50 comments deep into ranting about mental illness, trans-species, perverts, genital mutilation, and whatever the fuck else comes to these people's minds when this subject is brought up. This happens over and over again. it's a 10-1 the ratio of haters to supporters at least. I don't think many people would take money in exchange for their gender transition being the subject of mass national ridicule. It's really easy for you to say that it's worth it for the money. It doesn't look like it to me.   You want a true hero for the transgender men and women out there? Kristin Beck.   Yeah, well, neither Jenner nor Beck are my ""heroes"". I honestly don't care that much that a person was courageous and then transitioned. Good for them. But that doesn't make me want them in the spotlight. I think the people who are the best examples of us are people who have a broad knowledge of other people's experiences with gender and can communicate really effectively about it with the masses of ignorant people. Jenner and Beck aren't that. I especially don't like that Beck has a lot of criticism for people who are trans and don't live exactly as she thinks they should. Also, both are conservatives and come across as a bit selfish. I'll have a hero when someone comes along that makes my trans status not a fucking detriment to my career, or even having a job, or makes it so that I could be out and treated like a normal person.

But this isn't about me. This is about why Caitlyn didn't deserve the honor.  Merriam-Webster definition of Courage:  noun; mental or moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty.  Caitlyn Jenner has turned her gender reassignment into a multi-million dollar media circus. She has profited both financially as well as in regards to publicity. While I do applaud her for bringing the issues facing the transgender community to the forefront of the public eye, her profiting by it is in poor taste.  This is all aside from the implications that the Arthur Ashe was promised to her in return for giving the exclusive interview to the same network that happens to run the ESPYs. However, this is still America and I am a duly sworn agent of the law, and as such, we presume innocent until proven guilty. Despite that, the taint of impropriety is enough to put a bad taste in a MAJORITY of people's mouths.  During the preceding 40 years (you know, since Caitlyn was an Olympic Athlete), Miss Jenner has maintained a life that was counter to her identity. That is difficult. I'm not cheapening that. But her decision to undergo this procedure has had NO IMPACT ON THE WORLD OF SPORTS.  Michael Sam, being the first openly homosexual player in the NFL, was a monumental event in sports. Abby Wombach running over to plant a kiss on her wife at the World Cup was huge, because the impact was felt far beyond the United States. Caitlyn Jenner's gender reassignment surgery has absolutely nothing to do with sports. It has as much to do with sports as anything I do now (former high school athlete, oh them glory days). Let me ask you this way: If Oppenheimer came out as a transgender woman 40 years after the Manhattan Project, would that be a momentous occasion in the world of physics that deserved an award? No. It'd be brave, no doubt, but it isn't something that should have been compared to athletes whose bravery had more recent impacts on the sporting world. Hell, between Noah Galloway (lost two limbs; still kicks ass), and Lauren Hill (19 years old when she lost her battle with cancer; raised over a million dollars for pediatric cancer research), Caitlyn Jenner's struggles seem kind of paltry.  But hell, it's easier to make an attack on the way I'm phrasing my argument (which it was never meant to be, just a statement of opinion, but hell, since you asked...) than it is to counter it.

And for that, as someone who despises violence and supports body positivity, I am both sickened and sorry.  But...  One thing I have always been raised to respect, is the soldier.  Regardless of whether or not I think a war is needed, or the cause for it is just, should I see a man or woman in uniform on the street, I will always stop, and thank them, for I feel that just as much as it is your duty to serve and fight, it is mine to salute and honor those who serve and fight, and show that there are still, and there always will be, those who are eternally grateful that there are people like you doing the things and braving the horrors that more common men like myself lack the physical ability and/or mental fortitude to stand up and face.  You have my deepest gratitudes, sir.  Thank you for doing what lesser men like me could not and can not."

For someone who's celebrity came from being the epitome of manliness to go through all of this so publicly definitely takes courage.   What courage is there in up and deciding you are now a woman and making boat loads of money from magazine deals, awards, TV show appearances and interviews? Jenner is going to have her own reality TV series called ""I am Cait"". Sounds like a money grab to me. Not like they were already an attention whore... Why couldn't they do it less publicly? Jenner is doing just fine by the sounds of it.  Read this article, Jenner has an upcoming reality series and their camp were the ones that suggested the award. I also felt that the award doesn't sit right with me after they were just recently responsible for that fatal car crash that killed two people.  I think its safe to say that gays and trans people are welcomed in society by nearly everyone apart from hardcore religious people and some older folk. It's getting to the stage where its being over glorified, and gay acceptance in particular is for the most part becoming a non-issue. Yet the media is constantly going on and on about it, creating the narrative with any celebrity who comes out as gay/trans as though they are a huge hero. It sells.  Remember Michael Sam and Jason Collins? Good for them that they came out, but they were scrubs in their respective sports and it was blown way out of proportion. Michael Sam was last year's winner of the award as well. Like Jenner, he also did a million interviews and whole bunch of stuff for Opera.  No, i'm not homophobic or any sort of phobic.

It's not as though she's living in the same time and geography as Brandon Teena, subject of the incredibly sad film Boys Don't Cry.  I also don't think it's accurate to say that her contemporary image comes from being the ""epitome of manliness.""

sports,3dgrry,druin9,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"Personally it seems as though this award could not have been presented to Caitlyn and the rest of the trans community at a more appropriate time. As we may have all noticed trans issues have been for the past couple months at the forefront of media outlets, and for good reason.   There are a few threads through out this subreddit discussing the recipient of this award, the majority of them highlighting the lack of courage that Caitlyn Jenner is demonstrating by simply ""dressing like a woman"" and stating that trans issues are dated and no longer an issue within our community. The simple fact that the title of this thread refers to Caitlyn by her former name along with the plethora of  negative feed back present in the comments throughout this forum are enough to justify her award and speech. Yes there are some if not many people who heard Caitlyn's speech and empathized with her and are aware of the trials and tribulations the LGBTQ community face, but then there are the people on reddit, people within the crowd of the ESPY Awards such as Chris Culliver and Garrison Hearst (both publicly homophobic professional athletes) as well as those athletes who have smartly kept their personal opinions to themselves that validate the timing and reasoning behind the recipient of this award.  Yes, Caitlyn comes from a highly publicized family run by PR teams and television appearances but that is all the more reason why she is such an opportune candidate to be spreading awareness of trans issues amongst a broad cross section of the public.   Have we forgotten that Bruce Jenner was a star athlete, an American icon bursting with masculinity and testosterone. It is hard to understand her turmoil of living 65 years under an umbrella of heroism knowing that her gender identity could easily ruin her reputation. But now as trans issues become more pressing, Caitlyn is no longer being just a beacon of hope for those striving for atheletic excellence but also a beacon of courage for those struggling to make sense of themselves and the sometimes incredibly spiteful community that surrounds them.  Arthur Ashe faced heartbreaking persecution because of the colour of his skin, and it seems as though from the look of some of the people in this thread that Cailtyn will have to endure her fair share of bigoted and ignorant responses to what I believe is an incredibly courageous act as just being herself."

Your entire argument seems to hinge on that fallacy.  Just because a league with little parity is popular doesn't mean it wouldn't be more popular with more parity.  Close games are fun for fans of both teams.  Blowouts are only fun for fans of one side, and even then it gets boring before the game is over.  Also, college sports have more parity when you analyze it in raw numbers.  Ten or so FBS college football teams have a legitimate chance of winning everything every year.  You can't say that many pro teams have a shot.  College sports are also doing what they can to work towards parity.  The landscape changed drastically in the late 90's when they implemented scholarship limits.  Finally, parity doesn't stamp out the all-time greats, it's how they're measured.  Strength of schedule always matters."
sports,3dja8v,biznas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"First, there is no fallacy. While I can't prove that less parity makes more popularity, you can't prove the opposite. I can only provide some evidence and arguments.  Second, your example doesn't hold: there are 128 FBS teams, so with only ten having a chance that particular measure still points to less parity than any of the pro leagues.  Third, fewer parity rules does not necessarily lead to more blowouts. Just like the fans, no organization wants to get blown out. The profit incentive alone will push owners to field competitive teams. Again, there is precedent for this all over the world…blowouts aren't an issue"
sports,3dja8v,biznas,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a fallacy. It's called survivor bias, and this is exactly a situation where it applies.

sports,3dja8v,biznas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"My point is that since there exists popular sports leagues that aren't designed towards parity and that teams that have no shot at winning championships can still be popular.  Not only do examples of such exist all over the world, it is actually the norm. I'm not sure how you can prescribe a logical fallacy towards a simple observation.   The U.S. system is completely unique worlwide. Drafts, strength of schedule, salary caps: these things are all completely unique to American pro sports."
sports,3dja8v,MJDiAmore,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, they can still be popular, but that isn't what you said in your OP.  In your OP you aren't just making an observation.  You're attempting to draw a conclusion:   Of course, the main argument for parity is that there is more interest when more teams have a chance of winning and when the outcomes of games are less certain. But again, looking at all examples across the world, this is simply not the case. Leagues with little parity are still massively popular, from college football to European soccer.   This is 100% a classic textbook example of the survivor bias fallacy.  You're saying that parity doesn't increase interest, because there's plenty of interest in leagues with no parity.  How can you say those leagues would not be more popular with more parity?  I don't know if they would be more popular either, but I'm not the one drawing conclusions with missing information."
sports,3dja8v,here2red,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"How can you say those leagues would not be more popular with more parity?   I address that with all my other arguments. Such as the increase in popularity of a sport or league when there is a dominant team. The fact that there is interest in leagues that don't address parity is just the first part of the whole argument, meant only to establish that such leagues do exist and aren't completely abandonded by fans because of the lack of parity.  But anyways, I'm just making an argument. I'm not attempting to prove anything. It's just my hypothesis backed by some evidence and some reasoning. I'm not sure how one could prove either way without a ton of data and some detailed statistical analysis across many leagues and over time.  But the prevailing wisdom of 'more parity is always better' also has no evidence and furthermore, as I tried to say, stands on some assumptions that I feel are very shaky"

Essentially we're a country full of bandwagoners.  The reason that a sport's popularity rises when a generational athlete comes along like a Bolt or an Armstrong (pre-doping convictions) is because Americans latch on to winners like there's no tomorrow.  So when your local MLB or NBA team constantly finishes with records in the .350 range (well below even), no one goes.  To give you an idea -- the last couple seasons before the Nets moved from NJ to Brooklyn, you could get tickets off StubHub for 89 cents.  I'm not making that up.  And this is the empirical type of data you should be basing your argument on, not platitudes like ""fan bases are still strong with decades of losing.""  Because that's simply not the case.  The Phillies sold out constantly from 2007-2012.  I could probably get Phillies tickets right now (because we're abysmal this season) on StubHub for $5 or less.  (News flash, the cheapest seat in the stadium is like $27).  Fans most definitely speak with their wallets, just not to the level they really should.  Unfortunately, this matters less nowadays in making meaningful change because the vast majority of the revenues come from TV/media rights.  Whereas we used to have the power to influence teams to change strategy, now we really don't because Comcast has paid them billions to show games on TV.  Secondly, some cities also just don't care about sports (or all sports)  in general.  Here in DC where I live now, the Nationals are super popular now because they're good, but the Redskins will always take precedent however shit they are.  Nationals playing a Sunday day game in early September with beautiful weather (72 and sunny, no humidity)?  With 85+ wins already and pushing 100 for the season, a guaranteed playoff team?  Maybe 25,000 showed up.  Why?  Because it was the opening weekend of the NFL."
sports,3dja8v,TXJKU,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:12:49 2015 UTC,I disagree with your conclusion about uninteresting games being popular - they aren't   Even in college - nobody wants to see lopsided matchups
