I loved the overall creepy vibe it gave you. I found myself closely watching each extra in the background trying to find the one.
dvdcollection,3e0mv2,treyjyert,3,Tue Jul 21 01:20:59 2015 UTC,Definitely one of those movies I had to see twice in theaters. The first time I found myself getting lost in the background trying to find what was about to jump out. Great movie.

dvdcollection,3dzt6o,DVDJunky,6,Mon Jul 20 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"With stuff like this if you get duped, call up Amazon. They'll at least try to remedy a bad situation with deceptive sellers. I had a similar situation with eBay where I spent a LOT of money on a Blu Ray set only for it to arrive and the packaging was in German. This wasn't explicit on the listing so I tried to return it but the seller tried everything to get me to keep it or at least to charge me a restocking fee. They were being very rude so finally I contacted eBay customer service and they sent me a full refund an hour later. These sites want to maintain a reputation of being a reliable place to make purchases so they'll usually do anything they can to solve a customer's problem with a third party seller of they are the intermediary."
dvdcollection,3dzt6o,awesomeness0232,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've never had any issues with amazon's customer service. I do wish they had a report button next to these listings so it were easier to get it straightened out."
dvdcollection,3dzt6o,TIGHazard,3,Mon Jul 20 23:02:56 2015 UTC,"As someone that's had to deal with this from marketplace sellers, this is allowed (under certain conditions) such as If Amazon doesn't list the version of the item you are selling such as Two-Disc versions, retailer exclusive versions, or if you have a DVD Version and Amazon only has a listing for the Blu-Ray version. Also, a lot of this is automated, so the system may have the wrong ASIN number for the Barcode to tell Amazon it's available to sell. And I know people don't, but you're supposed to read the condition before you purchase. - NOTE: I am basing this off Amazon UK, which is what I have experience with, if Amazon US is different, I'm sorry and ignore this."
dvdcollection,3dzt6o,BaylorYou,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming, kind of like /u/awesomeness0232 said, that if you notify Amazon they will drop the hammer on the seller. Also, if you already buy it, Amazon will take care of you."

dvdcollection,3drk6s,Duffadash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is this: The Batman movies are hell to organize because of the animated features.  If you organize them by year of release, ignoring their alphabetical order you get something like this (assuming you keep TV series seperately):   Batman (1943 serial) Batman and Robin (1945 serial) Batman: The Movie (1966 tv-series spin-off movie) Batman (1989 Tim Burton movie. Part 1 of the Tim Burton film series) Batman Returns (1992 Tim Burton movie. Part 2 of the Tim Burton film series) Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993 animated movie. Part 1 of the Animated Series movie spin-offs) Batman Forever (1995 Schumacher movie. Part 3 of the Tim Burton film series) Batman & Robin (1997 Schumacher movie. Part 4 of the Tim Burton film series) Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1998 animated movie. Part 2 of the Animated Series movie spin-offs) Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000 animated movie. Spin-off of Batman Beyond, which was itself a spin-off of the Animated Series.) Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman (2003 animated movie. Part 3 of the Animated Series movie spin-offs) Batman Begins (2005 Nolan movie. Part 1 of the Dark Knight Trilogy) The Batman vs. Dracula (2005 animated movie) Batman: Gotham Knight (2008 animated movie. Takes place between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, making it part 1½ of the Dark Knight Trilogy) Batman: The Dark Knight (2008 Nolan movie. Part 2 of the Dark Knight Trilogy) Batman: Under the Red Hood (2010 animated movie) Batman: Year One (2011 animated movie) The Dark Knight Rises (2012 Nolan movie. Part 3 of the Dark Knight Trilogy) The Dark Knight Returns - Part 1 (2012 animated movie) The Dark Knight Returns - Part 2 (2013 animated movie)   and so on...  As you can see the animated film were continuously released between live action movies, breaking up the various trilogies. Even if you separate the animated movies from the live action movies, you still end up with Gotham Knight, which is technically a part of the Nolan trilogy. It does not help that most of the animated movies are actually pretty good, and therefore worth owning."

He had this Star Wars set for 60.  So I ran home, grabbed my old Xbox 360 kinect and my Sony ps4 headset I no longer use. He bought them for 30, I offered 55 for the Star Wars set and BOOM. I paid 25 bucks, got rid of two things that were taking up space, and have a whole weekend of Star Wars ahead of me."

The convenience of having all the main storyline episodes complied together is really great. The Black Oil set is the best X-Files had ever been.  Though, I do feel that Sleepless should have been included with the Ascension set. While it's main plot is standalone, it introduced Alex Krycek and has a coda at the end directly related to the main mythology."

Most of the deals showed up with little warning, many hours after the day began, and mostly while people were at work. At least during the mob-scene known as the real Black Friday, most people are on vacation, and they know what they're hunting for. I hope Amazon learns from this.    EDIT: And a lot of ""sales"" were actually just price reductions from the previous week's exorbitant listings. People were pulling up camelcamelcamel to prove this tactic. Again, deceptive.

dvdcollection,3die5t,beav0901dm,5,Thu Jul 16 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"I might get the full adventure just for the Flux packaging and the animated series, been waiting for that for ages"
dvdcollection,3die5t,ninjartist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:15 2015 UTC,The animated series will also be sold separately. Not sure how much that is weighing your decision.
dvdcollection,3die5t,SnoozeTrain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:31:10 2015 UTC,It all depends if the series has been remastered in HD and if it looks good.
dvdcollection,3die5t,Foxhack,4,Thu Jul 16 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"The discs on the photo say DVD, so a remaster is unlikely."
dvdcollection,3die5t,SnoozeTrain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"The blu-ray version contains the episodes spread out across the movie discs. Those DVDs are for, as seen, the DVD release of only the series."
dvdcollection,3die5t,Foxhack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:32:54 2015 UTC,"The boxset shown there has Bluray discs, and DVD discs for the cartoon. Also, the text only mentions a DVD release of the cartoon - nowhere does it say they come in a Bluray version, regardless of the version you get.  They could easily cram the entire series on a single Bluray at SD resolution (like Discotek does with their anime releases), I wonder why they didn't..."
dvdcollection,3die5t,Vejadu,6,Fri Jul 17 05:09:30 2015 UTC,Might be worth the upgrade just to get packaging I can get my BTTF discs in and out of.  The animated series and Flux capacitor are awesome incentives.

There are three headings: The 30th Anniversary Triology, The Complete Animated Series, and The Complete Adventures.  Is the animated series also being sold separately? That's what it kinda looks like. Also, what's the difference between the ""Trilogy"" and the ""Adventures""? Are they two different packages? It seems like the two have the same stuff, though there are more things listed in ""Bonus Features"" under the ""Trilogy"" one. Does that mean I'm not getting that with the ""Adventures""?"

dvdcollection,3dfagw,iLuv3M3,13,Wed Jul 15 20:35:22 2015 UTC,Lynch's best film in my opinion.
dvdcollection,3dfagw,redder23,10,Wed Jul 15 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"Anyone else not at all a fan of the cover art? It seems really weak to me. For such a brilliant film and hotly anticipated release for Criterion, I'm pretty disappointed with the artwork. (Not that the best thing about a Criterion release is its artwork, but it certainly helps when it's a bit pretty.)"
dvdcollection,3dfagw,TheLumberjack81,5,Thu Jul 16 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree. It was the perfect opportunity to do something unique, but it feels like it's just kind of slapped together. For a normal release it would be okay, but there's a certain expectation level with Criterion's designs and I don't think they hit it this time.  Y Tu Mama Tambien was the same way, come to think of it."

Really disappointed since Criterion usually has such beautiful releases. I honestly prefer the box art on my current version.   It also just comes with interviews with Lynch that have already been released. It did say ""More!"" so there maybe some really interesting unannounced special features but I'm pretty underwhelmed."

dvdcollection,3deky0,deandiggity,3,Wed Jul 15 17:42:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. I didn't realize I bought the DVD version.
dvdcollection,3deky0,DookiMode,2,Wed Jul 15 18:35:46 2015 UTC,I got this set at walmart for 19.99 last week. They might still have that price.
dvdcollection,3deky0,JohnLocke815,3,Wed Jul 15 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"Nice! I posted this because Amazon is using it on DVD as a ""Prime Day"" special when in reality it's not and is cheaper on Blu-Ray. Don't want people fooled."
dvdcollection,3de1js,TheLumberjack81,5,Wed Jul 15 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"Might have to accidentally order some, if not all of these.   I particularly love the artwork for Casino Royale and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Anyone else have any love/hate opinions?"
dvdcollection,3de1js,hansmilhouse,3,Wed Jul 15 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"These are pretty cool, but I'm really thankful you inadvertently reminded me to pre-order the You're Next Steelbook."
dvdcollection,3de1js,BillMurrayWuzHere,2,Wed Jul 15 15:30:48 2015 UTC,"Nice call, it looks great. Especially the back. I'm also excited about the pre-order for The Orphanage steelbook, but I'm waiting for them to finalise the artwork before I make the call."

dvdcollection,3de1js,Yeah_Okay_Sure,2,Wed Jul 15 18:57:27 2015 UTC,"Just so you guys know, Best Buy USA and  MediaMarkt.de have also announced these. Please click this link to see information for all of them.  Also, Zavvi does not list that they will be releasing Quantum of Solace or Skyfall, but Best Buy and MediaMarkt.de have them listed. MediaMarkt also has a Goldfinger, but it seems to be a previous release, similar to the previous Best Buy/Future Shop releases."
dvdcollection,3de1js,slayster,2,Wed Jul 15 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Damn. Probably for the best I own the complete collection on Blu-Ray or this would be a must buy and I would quickly be broke.
dvdcollection,3de1js,BaylorYou,2,Wed Jul 15 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Looks nice, but for me to be tempted it would have to be the whole set not just 7 popular ones."
dvdcollection,3dem93,kyak12,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:51 2015 UTC,Awesome collection! I love What If. Need to pick that up on sale sometime.
dvdcollection,3dem93,Yeah_Okay_Sure,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:01 2015 UTC,Cheers! That was the girlfriends choice so the pressure is on her haha.

dvdcollection,3ddtrt,deandiggity,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"If you love Tarantino's movies and are a collector(safe to assume you are), it's great. I haven't gotten through all the extra content, but just having the films on Blu-Ray in a beautiful boxset makes it worth it to me alone. Seriously, I love the boxset and the artwork."

dvdcollection,3ddtrt,treyjyert,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:18:22 2015 UTC,The picture of Chronicle on BestBuy shows it comes with a code for a ticket to Fantastic 4 so $4.99 is pretty good.

dvdcollection,3dc13k,Hikki_Panda,15,Wed Jul 15 02:29:05 2015 UTC,Lord of the Rings:Extended Edition set for $27.99 on Blu Ray
dvdcollection,3dc13k,whowhatwhere11109,8,Wed Jul 15 07:03:25 2015 UTC,I've been holding off on this for so long waiting for the price to come down... looks like now might finally be the time to buy.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,AlmostWorthless,2,Wed Jul 15 12:08:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is going to be your best bet. Don't wait too long though, the deal of the day items can sell out."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,whowhatwhere11109,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:48 2015 UTC,Just bought it. I also had a $2 amazon gift card credit so that helped as well.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,Ihaveanusername,2,Wed Jul 15 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"The only time this can go down any further is Black Friday/Christmas time. $27 is a good buy, but I'm going to push for December."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,whowhatwhere11109,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:35:38 2015 UTC,Good luck! If you look at the Camel price tracker the lowest it has ever been prior to this was $29.99 and that was on Nov 25th 2014. I hope it drops more for you in December!
dvdcollection,3dc13k,Ihaveanusername,2,Wed Jul 15 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'm still thinking about it, but yeah. I don't think it'll go lower, but hopeful! :)"

EDIT: Found their sale page, but it's pretty underwhelming. Maybe camelcamelcamel will alert me to some stuff.    EDIT2: Got some DVD & Blu-Ray deals on the Gold Box page. But they're going fast.    https://youtu.be/oewMbg8wFQU"
dvdcollection,3dc13k,awesomeness0232,5,Wed Jul 15 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"Metropolis Blu Ray for $8.99....I clicked on it RIGHT as the sale went live...BAM! POOR WAITLIST. Fuck you Amazon.  Thanks to u/SsurebreC for the heads up, apparently the $8.99 isn't the most original. So I take it back, Amazon, Thank you! :D"
dvdcollection,3dc13k,SsurebreC,2,Wed Jul 15 04:50:07 2015 UTC,Really bummed that I missed that one. I stopped checking for a couple hours because all the deals were so lame then I see that shit and there's a waitlist.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,Ihaveanusername,2,Wed Jul 15 20:09:43 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about this one by Moroder then you should cancel it. It got awful reviews and it has a lot of the more modern singers. It was even nominated for razzies for music specifically. Considering it's a silent movie, that's a big deal.  The one you want is this one. It's not only restored but they also include title cards for actual missing footage and they fixed up the original soundtrack rather than using completely new music like Moroder's mix.  As far as the price - this is typically almost $20 and it rarely goes anywhere. If you're more of a purist where you want the originally restored video (and audio!) then you should get this version."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,SsurebreC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:07:33 2015 UTC,WHOA! I would have hated myself if I bought that one. Thanks for the heads up! I had no idea there was a restoration version. Definitely want the most original as possible. I guess it worked out for the best. Thanks Amazon! :D
dvdcollection,3dc13k,jihiggs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah - it's been in my wishlist for a few years, lots of discussions about the various versions :]"

Got my fiancée Dawson's Creek Complete Series for $25 as well as the complete Shrek series on Blu-Ray for $30 (that was for me). They also had a good deal on Despicable Me 1&2 for $7.99 each on Blu-Ray, but I told myself Shrek was enough of a kid's movie purchase for me. Love 1,2 and 4 and $30 for them on Blu-Ray seemed too good to pass up."

dvdcollection,3dc13k,TheVioletBarry,2,Wed Jul 15 13:23:19 2015 UTC,No worries - just want to make sure others know it's not a Prime Day special or anything.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,TheVioletBarry,8,Wed Jul 15 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"I can't even tell which ones are prime day sales and which ones are just standard mark downs (other than the, for some reason, super advertised LotR boxset). This sale's a real downer. Absolutely none of the movies I planned and have now checked for sales have changed price..."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,akujia,4,Wed Jul 15 15:40:16 2015 UTC,"That's generally how it goes, even with Black Friday.  I've always gone into sales like this with no expectations or hopes of what's going on sale and if something I like or could want ends up on being on sale, I'm happy."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,kyak12,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I guess so. I just sort of figured they would throw entire categories of Blu-rays and DVDs on sale instead of just specific ones. I mean, there are thousands of movies, just how many people do they expect will care if they put 3 dozen or so on sale?"
dvdcollection,3dc13k,adamgb,2,Wed Jul 15 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"With what I'm noticing how they're handling things, and it's been very similar to Black Friday, they typically put things on sale that they may have a huge surplus of in the warehouse with the occasional ""let's give them this amazing thing for this price"".  I'm still waiting for something to make this ""Better Than Black Friday"" as they put it, but the way it's looking, it's on par with it at least."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,kyak12,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"Agree. They touted that the sales will be better than Black Friday ... but, in my opinion, they're not ... at least regarding DVDs."
dvdcollection,3dc13k,ShitGetsBrill,7,Wed Jul 15 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"PSA: For those of you that aren't already; follow the DVD and Blu Ray deals on their department page, not the Prime Day page. I've found more deals by doing this and I don't have to skim through webcams and bloody Frozen Olaf toys."

dvdcollection,3dc13k,sbfaught,6,Wed Jul 15 19:10:26 2015 UTC,What the hell man. Some of these prices went up since the last few days. The Tarantino Collection went from $57.99 to $99.97 and the Woody Allen Bundle went from $25.99 to $60.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,diceman89,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:22 2015 UTC,Tarantino XX Collection is still $57.99  Link is in today's Beav's Bargains post
dvdcollection,3dc13k,AlmostWorthless,3,Wed Jul 15 14:20:50 2015 UTC,Yeah if you get it through the link. If you look through the Prime Day sales it's at $99.97.

dvdcollection,3dc13k,ZoruaUnited,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:20 2015 UTC,Just got it too! Missed it in theaters but decided to blind buy because of all the great things I've herd about it.

dvdcollection,3dc13k,JacquesCiesla,7,Wed Jul 15 21:23:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty underwhelming all-around if you ask me. I already have the Lord of the Rings boxset, and just about everything else has already been on sale all week."

dvdcollection,3dc13k,AlmostWorthless,3,Wed Jul 15 03:13:34 2015 UTC,I skimmed through it and they are having some interesting deals on tv boxsets.  Although I can't judge if they are good or not since I don't know how they price stuff there.
dvdcollection,3dc13k,JacquesCiesla,2,Wed Jul 15 03:15:21 2015 UTC,Did you happen to see the breaking bad collectors box set?

dvdcollection,3dc13k,tbc34,3,Wed Jul 15 15:18:32 2015 UTC,That price seems to have been pretty much steady for he last few days. I'd like to get it around 80-90. That would be a great deal.

Love the movie but never really felt it needed an upgrade since it's not overly visual"
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,blaman27,4,Wed Jul 15 03:47:19 2015 UTC,I hope your re-watch has shown you that it is an extremely visual movie and a gigantic upgrade over the ancient non-anamorphic DVD from like 1997.
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,schwano,2,Wed Jul 15 07:35:45 2015 UTC,I'm sure I will. I just hate having to spend so much on a movie so old. Damn you criterion
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,hansorg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:10:41 2015 UTC,Universal released a standard version of this earlier in the year for under $15. Sounds like that woulda been the way to go for you.
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,hansorg,3,Wed Jul 15 10:45:38 2015 UTC,I saw that on amazon. I heard the video quality was about on par with the dvd. Figured if I'm gonna upgrade I may as well really upgrade.

dvdcollection,3dc9ri,beertastic,0,Wed Jul 15 13:59:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, this is one of my favs so it's probably worth the $25, I just hate I already bought the dvd for probably $20 when it first came out then had to rebuy it for more. I would mind less if it was my first purchase. I think all upgrades should be discounted if you trade in the old one. That should be a permanent deal."
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,blaman27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:39 2015 UTC,Best Buy used to have an in-store deal like that. Don't know if it still exists.
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,eightslicesofpie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"I know they have it sporadically. Trade in any dvd and get $5 off any blu ray $14.99 and under.  Wish they had one permanently where you bring in a dvd and get $5 or $10 off when you buy the same movie on blu ray. Some dvd companies do that, rebate when you send in upc of dvd and blu ray, which is super nice of them, haven't seen that in a while though"
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,InquisitiveCigar,0,Wed Jul 15 17:16:28 2015 UTC,Lol
dvdcollection,3dc9ri,InquisitiveCigar,2,Wed Jul 15 11:57:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I recently found out a few of my criterion DVDs were also non-anamorphic.  I was pretty pissed.

dvdcollection,3dbo7t,Im_Grizzzly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:47:20 2015 UTC,I see someone else saw the sale signs at Target.
dvdcollection,3dbo7t,PREDXENO426,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:06:48 2015 UTC,What did you do with the slipcovers? Please tell me you didn't throw them away.
dvdcollection,3dbo7t,heypossiblenephew,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"I do throw them out. I know, I'm awful."
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,PREDXENO426,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:20:42 2015 UTC,What country is that from? That's a killer case. Really jealous compared to the one I got.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Yeah_Okay_Sure,2,Wed Jul 15 05:28:37 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain that's the Target Exclusive steelbook if you're asking about True Detective.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Vaelyna,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:53 2015 UTC,Yeah. Damn. I bought mine at Target and didn't get that one.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Yeah_Okay_Sure,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:47 2015 UTC,"USA, It's a target exclusive."
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Yeah_Okay_Sure,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"That sucks. I bought mine at Target in the US as well and they didn't have it as an option. Oh well, still an awesome show and a great have on Blu-Ray."
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,ShitGetsBrill,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:17 2015 UTC,I don't know about your local Target but two out of the three in my area still have 1 or 2 copies.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Yeah_Okay_Sure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:25:05 2015 UTC,Now comes the internal debate to go look. Probably not worth the extra money seeing as I bought and opened mine a while ago and can't return it.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,ShitGetsBrill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:39:49 2015 UTC,I guess. I bought both versions because I loved that season so much that I need both releases.
dvdcollection,3dbsgc,Yeah_Okay_Sure,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:08 2015 UTC,Right now you're that little devil/impulse on my shoulder telling me to buy it...not helping lol.
dvdcollection,3dc84v,Gaara1187,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:25 2015 UTC,I HATE the fanning sisters doing the new dubbing for totoro.  It's sad how hard it is to find the orginial dubbing. Other then than that nice pick ups!
dvdcollection,3dchs8,SeparateWay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"Have you told your PS3 to output stereo only?  It should be able to downmix 5.1 to stereo I believe.  I watched it for the first time last night (though I have a home theater, receiver, etc) and thought the score sounded absolutely fantastic."
dvdcollection,3dchs8,beertastic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:49:12 2015 UTC,"I did, but my tv wont take separate video and audio channels. Oddly enough, a torrent has the same effect on my computer, but the closest thing I found to work is watching it on vudu"
