This definition is clearly forceful rape.    Good start.  Will that realization affect your approach to the study?   But apparently non-forceful rape is a thing, and women can be raped without ever realizing it. So this makes those numbers even more suspect...   Apparently it's not rape if the victim is unconscious.    from the link:   To limit ambiguity, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) definition of rape was adopted for this study, which is “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”14 In addition, only completed acts were counted as rape; attempts that failed to result in penetration were excluded.

It's never been about actual rights for men and it never will be but I think the red pill and similar ideologies have truly taken over and the massage and he and disdain for women is on the forefront.

Criminal defence attorneys however are generally male, juries don't like seeing women get as pushy and aggressive as defence attorneys have to in order to do their job, and that hurts cases.

It changed my mind on at least labeling myself a feminist, or thinking that feminism had become something I didn't want to associate with. If I can dig up the title later tonight and post it, I will.

againstmensrights,3devfc,saintartaud,7,Thu Jul 16 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"Here's the number one problem in what you've written--bell hooks has never railed against you personally (she probably doesn't even know you exist), and taking a critique of society personally exasperates the problem. bell hooks, along with most of modern social theory, is based on the idea of systems theory--we build structures and systems as a civilization that are inevitably imperfect. Critiquing individuals is pointless. Yes, yes, it's nice that you're a nice guy, good for you, but can you put your nice guy-ness aside for just a moment and take a look at how what society has given you by virtue of being a middle class white male but not given others may just not be fair? Feminism, at least the third-wave feminism I subscribe to, has no interest in critiquing individuals. Its interest is in critiquing the structures that some benefit from disproportionately from others.  As for the MRM, you have to realize by now that they're not working on any real issues and are not a social movement at all. A recent thread in /r/mensrights from a person suggesting MRAs actually get off their asses and do something was literally met with, ""But typing on reddit is doing something!"" Male issues are being brought up in feminist circles, albeit not always perfectly, and, while I'm sure there are some feminists who believe that men can't be victims sexism, they're a minority and easily argued against."

I'm blaming the system, the economy, the government, the culture that our systems of power have created, which is something outside any individual or group. To say that Clarence Thomas and Cornel West share the same culture would be ludicrous but there is a system that oppresses them both in different ways as black men.  If you think I'm denying people like what you're talking about exist, you didn't read my reply very closely when I said,    ...and, while I'm sure there are some feminists who believe that men can't be victims [of] sexism, they're a minority and easily argued against.   In fact, I validated that they DO exist but I believe they're easily argued against.

It ain't always about teh menz.  As another upper middle class white male I never saw that bell hooks was hassling me personally, but it, like feminism in general, allows me a lens to see view my behaviour and how the world interacts with me. I don't have to agree with it, and I don't accept all of it, but it allows me an opportunity to address the issues that men face too.  I don't see that with the men's rights crowd. I don't get that from the men's rights crowd. What I see and read and experience is a confused melange of griping and whining and trying to solve the problem (if we can even stretch that far) by blaming some one else.  When I look at myself, I wonder why I'm not a men's rights activist. I'm in the demographic, for certain. I have some of that same frustration in life. But here's the thing, the only thing I can think of that parts me from the MRA is I don't blame women, or feminism for my problems or where I am today, because they aren't to blame for my problems, or where I am today."

Even accepting the concept that the feminist movement has some policies detrimental to me, the movement as a whole is far better at dealing with any men's issues than the men's movement is.

Also, u/apotheosis276 didn't say that feminism has to have a clearly defined end, nor that it had to have a clearly defined means tied to that clearly defined end. All he/she said was that if you do not have a clearly defined end, then your claim of being true feminists is no more valid than those who have a different goal than you. Similarly, if you do not have a clearly defined means to reach your end, then your claim of being true feminists is no more valid than those who would use alternative means to reach that end.   He/she was pointing out a lot of presumptions on OPs part about what feminism is, and how it should be done. While I agree that most MRAs point to teenagers on Tumblr and ignores well researched and reasoned feminist theory, u/apotheosis276 is right that a lack of clear definitions and the broadening of what feminism means has made it so you can't really say those Tumblr kids aren't legitimate feminists."

It is not hard to imagine a couple having black-out-drunk sex, then in the morning having a facetious conversation, comparing who initiated, pursued, aggressed, penetrated slightly more than the other trying to figure out which one of them raped the other.

I can see that even though I initiated 5% more than you, you penetrated me 6% more, so I'm a victim of rape but if you had just initiated 2% more that would have turned me from a rape victim into a rapist.""

You still see this in a lot of war-torn or economically unstable places: nonprofits generally focus on empowering both women and young men, women because they use their newfound wealth and economic agency to lift up their communities, young men because if you don't give them something to do, they'll just fuck shit up.   *Which isn't to say that women never cause trouble.

There are zillions of guys out there,  of all colors,   sizes, cultures,   shapes, religions,  creeds,  and whatever,  and they don't get laid because they look for technicalities they can exploit. They get laid because they're decent.  ""Well....she didn't say no.""   If they have any doubt,  they wait.  Then both of them can enjoy it,  which is what nice,  decent people want. If,  when sober,  she backs out,  no big deal,  because what's important is consensual fun.  Everybody's happy.    Nobody's talking happy drunk hook ups here.  A woman (or guy) who's utterly wasted cannot consent,  and the decent thing to do no matter what your gender or whatever is to back off. If you have any doubt,  it's pretty simple.  These guys act like the only way they get laid is if a woman lapses into a coma in front of them.   These guys always shriek that feminazi harpy bitches are out to celibasize men,  but these guys are the ones trying to get away with being predators.  They're pretty revealing,  actually:  the whole mindset is,  ""But if I can't fuck seriously-wasted, vulnerable,  comatose, girls,  then I'll never get laid,  probably because my hatred and contempt for women drives conscious women away.  And that is not fair. Women owe me sex!""  Consent is really easy-----and sexy as hell.  What these guys want is the exact opposite.

Here is the criteria for ADHD for the DSM 5 according to the CDC:  http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html  Notice the lack of any mention of ADD? Even in the link you provided it stated: ""The condition is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD), though this is considered an outdated term.""  So while people still use it, they are using it erroneously and whenever I see another mental health professional use ADD it makes me cringe a little bit because it kinda shows their dated knowledge of the subject.  Again though, it is a pet peeve because I recognize how pretty minor it is and arbitrary since it wasn't like the day they decided to change it to only ADHD it magically changed the symptoms in people and it was purely just a name change... but pet peeves are allowed to be minor arbitrary annoyances :) lol."

Now, if you will, allow me to discuss this issue. Please realize that there are different experiences across different collectives and I know my radical politics aren't quite ""popular"", but, still, please allow me to explain myself.  I have been an Anarchist organizer for a while. I help out with Food Not Bombs, I help organize events, etc.  I have noticed a somewhat large influx of ""Liberal Feminists"" coming to our meetings and general assemblies. They are certainly most welcome (as are all non-fascist, anti-capitalist friends :D), but, their disruptions are not welcome. Allow me to explain before you yell at me.  We have a unique process to how we raise issues. We pass out pamphlets and handouts to alert newcomers to how we operate and how they can participate. For some reason, these Liberals completely disregard our rules.  (Again, not Liberal bashing here, just how some of these newcomers are. All Anti-Capitalists and Leftists are allies.)  They yell out of turn, and attempt to recruit our fellow Anarchists into their Liberal movements. This isn't a bad thing, but their views do not fit within our Anarchistic thought.  Often times, we find our meetings being disrupted because a Liberal raised the idea of calling the cops (...What?) on people who didn't do anything wrong to raise awareness (...What?).  So, we tell them that we don't operate that way and we would rather organize protests, raise awareness, and use direct-action methods (sit-ins, occupation, large marches, etc)  They get upset when we refuse to use the law and authority to further our agenda. We do not affiliate with police simply because no good can come from it within our cause, however, they simply choose to disregard that.  The most recent case of bad behavior from these types came from one raising a not-so-popular opinion about using law enforcement for our own purposes. She and her friends got shutdown by our assembly via vote.  This angered her and she left. About 15 minutes later, we had police show up to our collective. Apparently, she called the cops and told them that we were planning on building bombs and bombing the courthouse and police stations, so they sent a few officers to investigate. That turned into a yelling match over everyone because at least ten cops were there yelling at us about bombs and what not. It was a very frightening experience.  We had to shutdown our public meetings due to that. It scared all of us. Instead, our meetings are invite-only. If you know someone, and can vouch for them, you're invited.  We still hold a public forum once a month though.  I'm all for radical feminism! I love it! Just not authoritarian feminism.  I know my events are localized. This has just been my very unfortunate experience with my collective."

Some reddit mod teams took solidarity with AMA in how the admins of reddit are inconsistent, and absolutely crap at communicating things, and in this case, really  unfair in how they threw a wrench into a subreddit's gears.

againstmensrights,3bvvgq,turk4lyfe,5,Fri Jul 3 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"A comparison of these two statistics underlies a fundamental ignorance about fitness and sports communities, and exactly what PEDs have the capacity to do and why they are used.  A little known fact about steroids is not only can they be safe, but you can remove virtually all trace of their usage quickly prior to a drug test.   There are some sports where steroid use is just systemic. Its no surprise this the case for powerlifting, bodybuilding and weightlifting, but you might be surprised knowing a good majority of, say, amateur cyclists dope even when competing for local, inconsequential events.  Its also true the overwhelming majority of elite athletes in all sports are on some kind of gear. No athlete, no matter how beloved and adored, can be considered beyond a shadow of doubt above this practice.  Now on to the subject of a specific subset of steroid usage - solely physique. A common misconception about steroids is that they only make you 'huge', when they can do things as simple as accelerate progress (gains and performance), allow you to cut down to very low body-fat % and recover from injuries more quickly.  They can also push you past your genetic potential, which is desirable for strength sports where it is difficult to see little to no progress after a good many years. Thus, experts link male steroid usage to a predisposition to 'risk-taking' as opposed to the psychological disorders and dysmorphia associated with eating disorders.    All this said, its important to examine how the fitness industry and hollywood exacerbates this problem.  It can be extremely hard to tell whether someone is on juice, as some physiques achieved this way can also be achieved over a much longer period through tirelessly hard work. Further, we currently consider most aesthetic those body types which hover around our limit of genetic potential.  Some examples: male 1, 2, 3, all of these men; female 1, 2, even women competing in the bikini division of bodybuilding competitions use gear to reach their incredibly low body-fat (while maintaining a surprising level of muscle definition).  Its also no secret stars like Tom Hardy, Hugh Jackman, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans used steroids for their superhero physiques (not necessarily for size, as they are attainable naturally, but due to their busy schedules and the duration over which the progress was achieved).  This feeds back into a culture of masculinity where readers and viewers are continually asking for stronger, bigger and more ripped actors and models without any regard for their health, while fitness mags and websites sell this idea of masculinity through bogus 'How to Look Like Wolverine in 12 Weeks' programs to impressionable young males knowing it is unattainable.  I'll believe Mr's actually care about male body image issues and the structural issues in 'Men's Health' when they start bringing it up independently; protesting magazine covers with models who don't openly admit to their steroid use, disappoint young men through their lying about workouts, and movie directors who require unnatural means for their male actors to achieve their superhero physique.  This would be so much more helpful than pretending society cares about women's eating disorders while they're still rampant throughout the modelling world (those very models shamed for being 'skin and bones') and the fact that all movie actresses are required to maintain near unhealthy BF% to be considered for any roles in hollywood."

About when they turned their sights to target local and national people who'd ""earned"" the MRBM's ire.  Not that they bug me anywhere near as much as Randi, but...someone found a very old picture of me on Twitter in which my hair was brown with three little pink streaks and they whined about that. From, like, 2006. TWO THOUSAND AND SIX y'all. Highlight was a Gator saying he'd, uh, forcibly violate ""it."" Gosh, thanks. But MRAssholes aren't transmisogynists.   Anyways, there's also this weird belief, as someone who used to have not-in-nature colored hair ALL THE TIME (oh high school and college I misseth thou) there's a certain percentage of White America who really believes it's some sort of ""kinky"" thing. Which, really, it was mostly social armor during dark times in my life, but if it was someone's kink that's great but at the same time this is the sort of White America sorts who look down on all kinks, methinks.   So, basically, it's a)as pointed out below, the MRAsshole fears women with bodily agency, as their theology says we don't get that, b)an odd coincidence as blue-haired anime girls are fine but blue-haired actual girls are not in GGMRA-world, and c)GGMRA sorts have identified a pattern of women who don't behave the way they want and are thus whining about it.

againstmensrights,3bnw8z,redyellowand,-4,Wed Jul 1 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's because humans tend to be opinionated and then be opposed to opinions different from their own. When you actually socialize and interact with people in the real world you have those opinions and feelings challenged on different levels on a regular basis. That's normal, you grow from it, it's healthy.   On the other hand, if you exist and/or socialize primarily via the internet, you just exit the tab, block the person, or generally move on when anyone says something you don't like. I think this leads to bad things, basically a bubble containing your largely unchallenged opinions with which you can seek out other people who have a similar bubble of thought-process, which keeps going until anyone outside your collective bubbles can be considered this and that but most importantly a target of this anger you otherwise can't expend without being challenged, and so they then become a target.  That's how I see Harper and a lot of people so incredibly embroiled in this conflict.   Why should Harper be the subject of a piece like this? I think she should because she's long been in and used a position which has allowed her to use her collective bubbles, aka unchallenged influence of opinion, to hurt a lot of people. The article later goes into that with specific examples, interviews with specific persons.  So I guess it's a natural reaction to such a toxic person; she hurt enough people, abused the voice she had, and was mean on the internet to enough people for someone with a column to see it and ""call her out,"" so to speak. That's what I think this is.  Sorry for the essay. I was trying to wrap my head around a stupid yet loud phenomena."

againstmensrights,3bn885,Throwaway2223337,8,Tue Jun 30 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"I hate when MRAS bring up Japan, because then everything they say is wrong. Not that it isn't, usually. But when Japan appears, it's a guarantee.   The completed suicide rate for Japanese men is 2x that of women, not 300%, as of 2009. This is a much closer gap than the world difference in rates.  http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/japa.pdf  Fig 6 in the article below shows that ""there is little difference in suicide rate between males and females considering that suicides consist of the sum of completed and attempted suicides."" Counting everyone who tries to commit suicide, regardless of failure or success, it is equal between the sexes. Five times as many women in Japan try to kill themselves as succeed. Both genders use poison, suffocation, hanging as their primary method.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16796024  Obviously, one explanation for this is that men use more violent or extreme approaches than women even in the absence of guns, and within this rather broad category. Perhaps if guns were legal, more Japanese men would successfully kill themselves and the gender differential would look more similar to that of the US. How is Japan relevant to OP's argument again, other than tacitly supporting it? The Japanese suicide rate is the second highest in the world. Did you know that Japanese train companies charge your family thousands of dollars if you try to kill yourself?  The Japanese government is totally aware of this problem and is actively working on it and the rates ARE DROPPING. Numerous published articles online discuss the legislation. Definitely not a lack of awareness and/or activism on this front. The biggest factors in male suicide are unemployment in the young and financial debt in the elderly. You can learn this from published papers within the top ten hits for a google search. These are the men who can't support a family. Patriarchal values directly killing off men, anyone? The statistics for Japan are totally and completely anomalous in a global context, utterly different from the characteristics of suicide in Western culture, and are a pointless and obvious red herring in this counter-argument."

againstmensrights,3bliob,thereisanxsuchthat,18,Tue Jun 30 04:53:10 2015 UTC,"The guns vs pills thing plays into an old trope that stretches at least as far back as the second world war.  Suicide by poison and indeed, murder by poisoning, is traditionally considered the preserve of women, whereas the use of weapons and violence in ending both one's own life and the lives of others is seen as a male role exclusively.  Another dimension to it is that men are far more likely to lead into their suicide with a murder spree, slaughtering dependents before they go, their family, wife, children or significant other going with them like treasured possessions of some viking warlord bound for valhalla, where they will ride eternal, all shiny and chrome.  It's easy to see how conventional, patriarchal gender roles feed into this phenomenon, rather than some feminist conspiracy calculated to drive men mad."

(Note: I am not trying to criminalize men here, it just happens to occur more in the male population, something that MRAs hate talking about)."

Poisoning was regarded as the preserve of women; guns and explosions were for men.   After the major incidents in America of mass murder with explosions and poisons, various restrictions were put in place; but not with guns - guns were seen as a healthy manly pursuit.   Just imagine if someone said their hobby was poisoning animals for fun. I mean, the animals are pests and it's acceptable but there are people who really love poisoning them."

Some quotes:   The male-female difference in methods is true outside the U.S. as well. In one cross-European study of suicides, more than 60 percent of males, but only about 40 percent of females, used firearms or hanging.   And a the difference in suicidal ideation is statistically negligible:   In 2008 and 2009, 3.9 percent of women had suicidal thoughts, compared with 3.5 percent of men.      Also, men are far more likely to own guns, according to Gallup.

I wanted to explain more of why it's important that men generally are more likely to choose firearms. One of the reasons is because they have more experience with them due to more men than women knowing how to use them. Which helps people overcome the fear of the act of suicide.

If you want to make video game and geek culture more accepted by society, stop treating these activities as something done by a specific group of people in an effort to block out newcomers and those that don't ""fit the bill."" The more you parade them as people who are misunderstood, the harder it is for people to get integrated by having to choose sides, and it makes those involved in gaming appear more as outcasts.  Repeat after me: ""There is no such thing as a true gamer."" And when you finally accept that, we can see gaming and geek culture as a set of fun and awesome hobbies rather than a specific group."

None have cried on my shoulder and I never cried on any of theirs when it happened to me.   which men's magazine has offered tips to escape a rapist.   This is part of the problem, our society either does not recognize male rape as a thing that actually happens or just outright does not care that it's a thing. No magazine cares enough to ever even mention it.   what areas/times he has identified as high-risk.   When it happened to me it was very early morning and I was alone in a girls house. I was sleeping over and we were the only people in the house. I've made sure never to be alone with someone I don't know and completely trust since.   ask him if he ever acknowledges male rape victims in any context other than to derail a conversation about female rape victims.

I acknowledge it every single day and I will for the rest of my life.    My bet is that if we were to see your real account, there'd be little, if anything, to back this up.  As a male victim of rape, I have never felt the need to derail conversations about women. rather, I take action such as supporting organizations (I have, in my comment history, proof of my support towards Just Detention Intl.) and I inform people around me who aren't feminists and who actually don't think men can be raped."

The market? That is a very juvenile way of looking at relationships. Like, taken straight out of a PUA book.   this is what happens when you price yourself out of the market, the more demanding and unreasonable you are the more likely you will be replaced and rejected, and women seem to be much less self critical then guys when it comes to realistic expectations etc.   You just went full red pill.

How is the first article you linked not against the male pill?

Sometimes it is not so much convincing him as presenting him with a fait accompli - just letting nature take its course.   Please tell me if I am misreading the article somehow, because to me it sounds pretty alarming.  She not only ignores the fact that men taking a pill doesn't mean that women can't also take a pill, but she says that men taking a pill is bad because it means men will have a way to say ""no I don't want to have a baby"".  In my mind the mistake they made is to take one author as the entirety of feminism.

The goobers cried foul.  ""You are not required to kill the strippers!  You get penalized for killing civilians!"" they said.  ""Most players go through that section of the game without murdering any strippers!""  Of course, if you search Youtube for ""hitman stripper"" you will find an endless supply of gamers doing just that.  Number two on the list is captioned ""In which we Enjoy Talking a Lot and Killing Strippers a Lot. We strangle and kill many strippers, then make piles out of them and watch them ragdoll and roll around the floor.""  It was published five months before Anita's first ""Tropes vs. Women in Video Games"" video came out.

I have no idea how the hell it works because GynoGrypers rarely understand that censorship is a government activity or an activity which a de facto government sanctioned monopoly engages in, not a woman talking about video games.   The fun part: I disagree with Ms. Sarkeesian on more than a couple of things. But I pay attention to her because even though she says gross and dehumanizing things about sex workers (for example), most of what she says is on point and I understand that good people sometimes say awful things. But unlike GhastlyGoat, I can disagree respectfully and not, you know, commit terrorist acts because I have hurt feels that someone criticized things. And then there's the anti-Semitic bullshit directed at her, fresh in my mind as I logged into my Warcrack server tonight to see our local shame, Baelof the MRAsshole, referring to her as ""Needy Jewkeesian"". Man, MRAs are so creative.  But sucking Anita into GooberGrape in the first place is the most positive proof GhastlyGripez is MRA-controlled. See, misters have been whining about AS for years. And in October, when GravyGross decided to expand, they targeted people MRAs can't stand. I'm one...not to the extent of Anita, but I used to work for an abuse prevention charity that helped disabled women get out of abusive living situations. And, well, this annoyed local misters, especially WF Price, who claimed we were stealing property and sends me a dead rodent in the mail or an envelope full of assuredly human feces now and then. I mean it may well not be him, but what other prominent MRAsshole lives in Bellingham, where the shipments come from, and called me a ""dangerous feminazi r--ard""? You got it, just WF Price.   Anyways in rapid succession in early October the MRAsshole world started all talking up GoofyGopher at exactly the same time. But still deny any involvement even as their own foot soldiers admit that it's a recruiting event for the Man Klux Klan.   We know the Manbabywhiner Reification Movement is very bad at being accountable for what it does (see how much they whine that Futrelle quotes them) but their hand is inside the till on GopherGossip, and that hand is part of why GG turned its ire to targets of the Men's Rights Bowel Movement, like Ms. Sarkeesian, at alleged random when GG became an MRA movement.

Have pride meant that you stuck up a middle finger to years and years of society telling you that you were inferior.  The reason no one wants MRAs celebrating ""pride"" is because being a man has historically been an ok thing to be. It's belittling to groups trying to find acceptance being something that society said was not as ok.  MRAs come from a group that has always had rights...I bet most of these people are White as well.

I do think it's a little reductionist because this doesn't take into account ideas a woman might become desensitized to (i grew up in a community in which the woman is always considered subservient to the man in a marriage, and many women accepted this because of the religious teachings of men and because they had been raised never to question that concept), nor does it consider that feminism is an incredibly nuanced movement occurring over numerous generations, with countless points of intersectionality with class, race, sexual orientation, etc, and filtered through many different contexts for each individual in the movement. but i don't quite see how all black people should be republicans or all women must subscribe to a single, hivemind concept of feminism... nor do i see where the feminist movement notably supports this idea.  all this not to say that i'm a little uncertain of how it ties into men's rights. not that i'm surprised..."

While Lincoln was a Republican, he doesn't sound at all like any Republican I've ever heard of.  I think it's also a pretty reductionist view of feminism, although I think it -is- useful to articulate the ongoing significance of feminism by reference to the past. The goals of feminism are more complex and nuanced than just 'get women the vote', and maybe that's a failure of marketing, but I like to think it's just a reflection on how far it's come. You get women in on the ground floor of feminism by demonstrating that progress, rather than trying to explain gender theory or self-selection in employment opportunities. Exactly as you put it in your comment.  As for Men's Rights, you've got to remember that this was a subreddit that touted for years (and completely unironically) that it believed in a ""feminist conspiracy"" to oppress men. They're so obsessed with 'bringing down' feminism that anything they can say or do to achieve that outcome, regardless of how tangental it is to the rest of their goals, is worthwhile. And that includes devoting all of their upvote muscles to worthless tumblr posts.  And, of course, that tumblr post buys into the 'controversial' idea that women used to be oppressed. It's a crapshoot as to whether any given /r/mr poster believes that, or whether they believe that women were never actually oppressed, and that the fabrication of history is, in turn, part of a greater conspiracy to oppress men.

They clearly state in the original article that it's still not the victim's fault.  If you teach a person to set up better defenses for being murdered, the person will more likely not get murdered.  the murderer is still at fault, and it's fucked up for innocent people to worry about it  If you teach a person to set up better defenses for being raped, the person will more likely not get raped.  the rapist is still at fault, and it's fucked for innocent people to worry about it  How much are they going to suck each other's dicks before they realize that no matter how naive a victim is, they are not at fault for being assaulted?  I think that the biggest problem with this ""logic"" is that if someone wants to rape someone else, they will do it. If everyone said ""no"", he/she would change their tactics to do it, making rape worse for everyone, not reducing it. Rape is a display of dominance and entitlement, and if they can't get it easily from someone, they'll go to someone else. Same amount of rape in the end, even if it's not on a college campus.  And the response to people like me who've said no and been raped with their back pressed against dirty leaves in the dark in urine, humiliated? ""You just weren't assertive enough""."

According to the folks who dreamed up this program, college women are currently being ""raped"" in epidemic fashion even though they have reasonable alternatives to engaging in the sex act but choose not to exercise them. In other words, a lot of college men are ""rapists"" not for forcing themselves on women but for doing nothing more than nagging for sex, and a lot of women are ""victims"" because they choose to go along with it.   Oh fuck me. This is why you people can't become more popular than you are. Because you have ass backwards thoughts on these issues like this.

I don't think anyone will see your comment as this thread is from a few days ago, but I'll try to answer you quickly.  It's rape if there is no consent given. Some examples of where consent can't be give : children, people who are asleep or very drunk/passed out, people under care of the state (eg prisoners) etc.  Sex that someone did not consent to is rape. If a person cant say no (eg passed out), or is too frightened to say no, it's still rape.  It's not really that difficult to distinguish what counts as rape, it's basically sex that a person didn't consent to."

That assumes that education systems are necessarily ones aimed at efficiency and therefore production. I think that is a dangerous endorsement of neoliberal capitalist orderings of society. There are a few other issues I take with gender segregated schools.   First, segregating genders lessens exposures betweens genders. I cannot give any 100% certain conclusions based on that, but it seems like socialization between genders would lessen. The post-education world isn't (strictly) gender segregated; you're going to have to learn to work with all genders.   Secondly, the idea behind gender segregating is blatant heteronormativity. The idea is that kids of opposite genders get distracted by the other gender because they're attracted to them. That assumes that they are straight. Obviously non-straight students would not be placed in different schools. I would think that the minority gay populations would be marginalized here, since the basis of gender segregation is a pseudo-puritanical belief opposed to sexual interaction.   Thirdly, gender segregated schools inherently erase the existence of trans/non-binary individuals. Not only are gender segregated schools heteronormative in their dealing with sexuality, but also because of their dealing with gender itself. Every student is assumed to be straight and cisgender. Although that is absolutely most common, you preclude the identities of individuals who haven't had a chance to fully develop them yet. I can't see stigma against these students being helped any by a system based on their non-existence.  I obviously don't agree with the linked poster, but I hate the counter-jerk that takes place in feminist spaces against arguments like in the OP. Sure, gender segregated schools would not be le STEM boys schools and arts and crafts girls schools. They would be another regime of forced heteronormativity, which I cannot accept.   I will say that girls only schools etc. along side typical schools are don't fall into all of my criticisms at the same length. My arguments pertain mostly to gender segregation as an imposed system on all schools. Although I do think that single-gender schools are still problematic in the assumptions they make. In any case, I don't think we should uncritically accept the idea of gender segregated schools just because they are more efficient and MRAs don't like them."

I'd just sit around and think about what I survived... as a survivor of it.  To me, a self proclaimed ""rape survivor"" is trying to convince themselves more than anyone else. I don't think those people, if they are real rape victims, have actually gotten over it yet.  Your identity shouldn't be tied to your rape, but that's what ""rape survivor"" does.

againstmensrights,39tbsn,DaneWhitman,16,Mon Jun 15 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"sure  Finland didn't ""warn"" 900,000 men about war conscription. The military has undergone a change in general strategy and the letter sent simply told where you'll serve if it comes to war. It isn't a retaliation to the whole Russia-Ukraine situation.  Other than that, it's your standard anti-feminist bullshit. Finnish feminists aren't any kind of unified group who view conscription the same way. I'd say most feminists are more likely to be against conscription as a whole, but also many are in favour of equal conscription. Sure, some are in favour of keeping it male only, which I personally disagree with.  It blames feminism for remaining silent on an issue that hardly requires any comment.  Also it seems to imply that men who serve as some kind of heroes who risk their lives, which is just kind of funny having served there. Most view it as a nuisance at best, some simply skip every field exercise by claiming to having hurt their knees etc.  anyway, it's just fails to make a point other than omg feminism is evil men are god. It's a complicated issue that the writer seems to know fuck all about. Equal conscription is probably far away whether feminists ""stay silent"" or not. The last comment I heard on it was from the finnish army general who said that because women have to give birth it makes sense to have conscription male-only which I thought was kinda silly."

It incorporates the word ""feminist"" which I think is a misnomer. Punching down on women isn't feminist. I'm not saying the feminist movement is without sin...shit, it's got plenty of sins, but I am saying that it's inaccurate to call anyone who punches down on women, and radical fauxminists punch down on many women who aren't trans women on top of punching down on trans women.   What it's not: I don't think it's a slur.  What it is: a term that I see people who don't stand up to other forms of pro-patriarchy activism use to refer to one particular sort of pro-patriarchy activism. I'd rather not do what radical fauxminists want strategically and rage against them and give everyone else who harms trans women a free pass. Patriarchy is like a hate hydra: it has many heads. You can't cut one off and expect the hydra to go away."

She has to realize that he did not have the exact same childhood he did just because he was raised female. He might not understand any of her perspectives and opinions she has developed due to her socialization, because he does not react the same way psychologically to the same experiences even if they do have experiences in common. Cis women do not get to just shout over someone else's personal experiences just because they're cis women and they can.

I'm cis, so obviously I'm not as attuned to these issues as a trans person would be, but in the ~10 years I've been in the feminist movement I've seen a HUGE shift in how trans people and their issues are treated. TERFs are still a presence, but they are much less accepted than they used to be within mainstream feminist spaces. Moreover, mainstream feminist blogs and publications include more trans writers, deal with more trans issues and are much more sensitive to transphobic and trans-exclusionary language. Again, I really recommend browsing this sub, its affiliates, and the linked sites.   Here are some examples of how some of the larger feminist spaces handle trans issues:   http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/category/politics/glbtq/trans/ http://feministing.com/tag/transgender/ http://everydayfeminism.com/tag/lgbtqia/ (they don't have a trans tag but this one includes a lot of articles about trans issues, by and directed at cis and trans people)  And how feminists are fighting transphobia within their own movement (includes discussion of how transphobia is actually antithetical to modern feminism):  https://www.facebook.com/AgainstTERFS https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lesbians-and-Feminists-Against-Transphobia/342749112475402 https://feministsfightingtransphobia.wordpress.com/ (there are a lot of links here regarding trans-inclusive feminism, worth checking out) http://bitchmagazine.org/post/the-long-history-of-transgender-exclusion-from-feminism http://www.salon.com/2013/07/11/the_hate_group_masquerading_as_inclusive_feminists_partner/ (kind of old but very on point re: TERFs' hypocrisy)   I hope all these links don't get my post deleted or put in moderation. Not sure how this works. (EDIT: Aaaand the formatting is fucked. No idea how to fix it, sorry.)  Again, I'm sorry you've had shitty experiences and I don't mean to dismiss them, but I DO want to assure you that TERFs and transphobes aren't nearly as prominent in the feminist movement as your experience might suggest, and certainly not as prominent as they used to be.

They recruit from within the trans community and convince trans people to not transition, and said individuals end up with severe psychological problems as a result (those I have known anyway), and/or try to convince them to not call themselves men and women, with similar results. They have successfully blocked transgender healthcare bills (The Making of a Shemale influenced this greatly, as did protests by radfems at the time). They have made it more difficult for trans people to access any kind of healthcare. They are directly responsible for the suicides of many underage trans people. It doesn't matter if they are a ""very vocal minority."" Know why? There aren't that many trans people. It's not that difficult to interfere with our lives when you outnumber us five to one, especially when you are more likely to be listened to by the majority. Especially when the rest of feminism is virtually apathetic to what's going on.    Your initial posts gave the impression that you thought TERFs = feminism as a whole.    If you believe that gender is a social construct and which is influenced entirely by how you were raised, and the only thing that really matters is biological sex, of course you are going to be transphobic. Transphobia is the natural outcome of that kind of thinking.    Criticizing transphobia within our own movement, as well as in the movements we disagree with.    Please show me. Show me how you are actually protecting trans people from this kind of oppression, or even attempting to help a little bit.

It's stupid to me to celebrate physical characteristics so much because that excludes so many people for absolutely no reason.   Unfortunately, the intersectional third-wave that most of us seem to be in line with here gets overshadowed by the 'wombyn' type second wave that puts a lot of emphasis on stupid stuff like reproductive capabilities. I guess since women's bodies have been disproportionately shamed throughout a lot of history, it's kind of understandable that the pushback would be overkill. However, there's something weirdly regressive about the second wave's focus on ladyparts like they're some kind of fucking exclusive club badge.   Regarding Reddit? Well, this is where I learned the word TERF because TERFs are reviled as much as MRAs in the circles I'm familiar with. I avoid the larger feminist subs and stick to AMR or SRS-related ones. I have seen very, very few people defend transphobia in these, and those who do have their comments removed or are banned.   Also take a look at Everyday Feminism. Though not a part of Reddit, one of their main focuses is fighting transphobia. They don't address MRAs too much but instead write a lot of articles critical of feminism in the interest of making it more generally inclusive and welcoming to ALL people.   I am sorry that your experience has been otherwise. I hope that you'll stick around, if you're interested in helping us think critically about ourselves so we can improve. I've always felt we were inclusive and intersectional, but being cis I don't know anything about what it's actually like to be trans. Co-opting people's experiences is stupid. I was pretty off-put by your original comments because with the brigading I'm feeling defensive and it just seemed like shit-stirring.

I used to sub to /r/TwoXChromosomes, but left a couple months ago because it's so often filled with/brigaded by MRAs and I was tired of it. There was plenty of racist rhetoric around there, too.

Then again, I am not transgender, so I acknowledge that I'm definitely less likely to run head on into transphobic/trans-exclusionary feminists.  I think more often than not feminists want to strive to be trans-inclusionary, but might be carrying around and perpetrating the micro-aggressions and little things they don't realize exclude and marginalize trans people. I also think there's been much more discussion in the past year or so amongst trans-inclusionary feminists about how to be a good trans ally specifically in regards to trans women, while being a good ally with trans men (as you are) has been sorely overlooked and under-discussed. This has probably fueled at least some of your negative interactions with feminists.  I get where your confusion and animosity are coming from. IMO, and I don't believe I am the minority in this, the ideas behind honest to goodness present-day feminism simply do not line up with the ideas behind transphobia and trans-exclusionary feminism. All I can say is no movement is perfect, and there are shit people in every one of them. My recommendation is unsub from /r/feminism, /r/AskFeminists, and especially /r/TwoXChromosomes. Hang around /r/TrollXChromosomes and /r/FemmeThoughts, and see what feminism is actually about."
againstmensrights,39hoxt,Sinister_Hand,-9,Thu Jun 11 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Another place where I have seen transphobia looked upon and dealt with harshly is /r/TrollXChromosomes.   I once ran across someone at /r/TrollXChromosomes who said they misgendered trans men who were ""misogynistic"" by her incredibly broad definition, 15+ upvotes. Misgendering trans men who don't toe the party line completely and perfectly is actually very common among feminist women.   TERFs are a vocal minority   I can see how it would seem that way to a cis person. Many people who do not think they are transphobic but are.    I am not transgender, so I acknowledge that I'm definitely less likely to run head on into transphobic/trans-exclusionary feminists.   Thank you for acknowledging that. However, it has been my experience that many people who cis people would describe as trans-inclusive in fact are very gender critical. I can't really this to you very well.    I think more often than not feminists want to strive to be trans-inclusionary, but might be carrying around and perpetrating the micro-aggressions and little things they don't realize exclude and marginalize trans people   There is no way that you're not doing that too. The only way to really fix it is close your mouth and listen when trans people talk to you about transphobia, or when they talk about their own lives.  The most annoying thing about cis women is assuming that there is a universal female experience that trans men also universally understand. Some women will try to claim a trans man's experience as her own, or when he talks about his experiences, she will reinterpret the story and add details which make it her story instead of his. This is a very annoying and invalidating experience.    the ideas behind honest to goodness present-day feminism simply do not line up with the ideas behind transphobia and trans-exclusionary feminism   Yeah they do. Most feminists believe that gender is a social construct and not real, and that biological sex and your gender assignment is the only thing that is valid. This essentially means that cis people are the only people with a real gender."

In the face of many people in this thread saying that we do not tolerate transphobia here, and we participate in a number of feminist circles that also do not tolerate it, you simply respond ""NO BUT FEMINISM AND FEMINISTS ARE TRANSPHOBIC AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY.""  Like, we get that transphobia in feminism exists, and even that a feminist may not be/think of their self as transphobic but still perpetuate some transphobic behavior and ideas. In cases like these, these feminists are often unaware of this and when pointed out to them they make efforts to change their behavior.  Regardless, right here is a bunch of feminists telling you that there's a significant and sincere effort being made on the part of feminists to be more trans-inclusive, with links to other threads, articles, etc. to back it up, and you're refusing point blank to acknowledge that these feminists exist because you've apparently only had negative interactions with feminists online and off. That doesn't mean the feminist movement is transphobic. To say otherwise is an argument built on a logical fallacy.  We're trying to show you other places and people that are not transphobic, that there's a lot of them out there, and you just want to argue that all feminism and feminists are transphobic. As someone else already said, you're pretty obviously just looking to demonize feminists, feminism, and specifically anti-MRAs in this thread.  In another response, you said this:   I'm just saying that even if you disagree with the things MRAs say about cis women, you should agree with the things they say about trans people, because that a view they share with the feminist movement.   And... no. Just no. Again, there's a ton of people in this thread saying this is not feminism, that this is not tolerated by many feminists, with links and articles to back it up, and you still insist it's something that MRAs and feminists as a whole should obviously be in agreement with when we're all obviously not."

I'm willing to admit you guys aren't as bad as I've been led to believe, but I also don't think you get how bad the problem is and how severely it has impacted our community.   In cases like these, these feminists are often unaware of this and when pointed out to them they make efforts to change their behavior.   In my experience, that's not necessarily true. When people are called out for their oppressive behavior the first instinct is usually to deny and argue. In the case of feminists, they use feminist theory to prove why I'm wrong and why they should be allowed to continue oppressing trans people. Again, that has been my experience. I get that my personal experience isn't the only one that exists, but it makes me kind of want to give up on this community.   Again, there's a ton of people in this thread saying this is not feminism, that this is not tolerated by many feminists, with links and articles to back it up, and you still insist it's something that MRAs and feminists as a whole should obviously be in agreement with when we're all obviously not.   The articles you guys linked to were links to extremely small communities or articles written by trans women, which doesn't exactly prove that trans inclusive feminism is popular in the mainstream, or popular with cis feminists. What I am talking about is an actual effort on the part of mainstream feminism to stand up for trans people when they are attacked by gender critical feminists.   If you have an article that has been published in a mainstream news outlet, or a book published by a feminist, or any other work of literature challenging TERF philosophy written by a feminist, I would love to know about it. If you can think of a single instance where a trans person was defended by feminists when TERFs attempted to dox, threaten or harass them, I would love proof. If the feminist movement has ever defended trans people from other feminists attempting to block pro-trans legislation, I'd love to see that too. When radfems threaten young trans children and encourage them to commit suicide, I don't see many ""inclusive"" feminists protesting their actions."

It's a privately owned website.   EDIT: There's no reason to maintain a completely laissez-faire speech policy in every private community. Fat people hate should understand this, as they had no problem banning anyone critical of them."

It's turning into a free-for-all. False flag ""harassment"" is probable.  This is what happens when you start down the road to censorship. [...]      The biggest danger is going to be from people adhering to these other subs ideologies trying to impersonate people on this/other subreddits to try to get them banned.  I think we should all be on the look out for extremists who are trying to make us look bad.      i wonder how long it will be before dedicated harasser accounts start popping up so that subversive users can start posting harassing comments in subs they want to get banned.      Look folks, you need to face it. Nobody gives a shit about those subreddits. Those are just a pretext to nail /r/mensrights and any subreddits that are unfriendly to hillary as we enter election season.   Outrage Forms   MRA's and SJW's use the same language because they are two sides of the same fucked up coin.  MRA's are a response to feminism.   Nope. MRA's are a response to Divorce Rape and Judicial Kidnapping.   And where did divorce rape and judicial kidnapping come from?  Feminists and women's suffrage.       Jesus, nothing's even happened and they're pictures themselves as fugitives...   We might want to find a secondary place of discussion. I doubt they'll hesitate to use it against us.   I hear talk that there's a general exodus to voat. Might be the easiest shift.   Everyone should have three or four different men's rights sites bookmarked.  That way, if any one of them goes down, there will still be a network through the others.       /r/MensRights is the new Civil Rights Movement   So - will this subreddit be removed and then an arbitrary excuse made up to justify it? That is the big question. Recall the common activities of police to oppress people of colour - arrest first, find a reason later.     Men's Rights is also like the Holocaust.   While these are not exactly quality subs that someone would want to keep, the old addage of ""They came for X, but I did not speak up because I was not X. When they came for me, no one was left to speak for me."" applies.     Oh this is a good one...   Why are some ""hate"" based subs banned (fatpeoplehate) but other subs supporting this type of message allowed?  /r/malepeoplehate redirects to /r/feminism   Why wasn't this four hour old sub banned with the rest eight hours ago?

Retirement Age varies from a minimum of 45 years in Turkey to 70 years in Australia. Policy makers usually consider the demography, fiscal cost of ageing, health, life expectancy, nature of profession, supply of labour force etc while deciding the retirement age.

There certainly are.  Anna Maria Tremonti: And do they have a place in your group too?  JT: Absolutely not, we are focus on men's health and weflare. Uh, there are extremist components in most social movements, and I think that uh, the men's movement is no different. But again our focus is on providing services to boys and men and fathers in need to strengthen families.  AMT: In his uh, article for GQ, Jeff Sharlet quotes um, someone who turns out to be one of your board members, Dan Perrins, who attended the conference organized by A Voice for Men last summer. And Mr Perrins is listed as the Canadian News Director for AVfM News, A Voice for Men's website. Isn't that a direct connection to the group?  JT: Well we have members on our, we have a 12 member board. We have board members who are individually members of all sorts of organizations including women's groups, including LGBT groups, including other men's groups-  AMT: But do your connections, the connection to A Voice for Men...?  JT: Let me speak specifically about these allegations regarding Dan Perrins, okay, because he is alleged to have said some very hateful things. And you know, Dan Perrins has suffered from PTSD as a result of himself being a victim of domestic violence for several years. Uh, he has made remarks that have been taken way out of context, remarks that were made on a distress call line.   Aside: I don't know what this refers to. Sharlet's quote was taken at the AVfM conference, not over a distress call line AFAIK...   AMT: Okay well I'm not going to ask you about Mr Perrins personally because we don't have the right-  JT: You brought him up.  AMT: I brought him up because he's quoted and I'm asking, he sits on your board, and he is with A Voice for Men.    JT: He's quoted in the article, so I'm referring to the quotes in the article. I'm trying to explain the context which wasn't given by your previous guest.   AMT: Okay, but my question is do you have people on your board who are associated with A Voice for Men? There are lots of quotes in there about how men see women in A Voice for Men.  JT: But we have people on our board who are associated with uh, centers that are dedicated to women's issues, okay, centers that are dedicated to women who are victims of domestic violence. We have people on our board uh, who come from universities, who run men's health programs. We have people on our board who are part of the LGBT community and are pioneers who have been fighting for gay rights for years. We have people on our board who are extremely broad, that's what makes our organization stronger.  And in terms of the diversity of organization, we have women and, and LGBT people, and people of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds who are involved on our board, who are involved in leading our groups. Half of our men's issue association campus groups are run by female students.   AMT: Why is a men's rights organization necessary?  JT: You know, we're not a men's rights organization. We're a men's health facility. We provide peer support for men who are victims of domestic violence. Uh, we provide counseling and therapy for men who are in danger of committing suicide. We provide mentoring and tutoring programs for boys who are at risk of not-graduating. Uh, we work with uh, women as I've said, we have women among our counselors uh, we have women who are facilitating that peer support group.

This doesn't really change the fact that radical feminists openly and publicly picketed, threatened and condemned Prizzey, or that she had reason to suspect them. They had threatened her before.

Female partners are also more likely to be in abusive relationships themselves, so the line of ""abuser""/""abused"" becomes very blurred.   Further, if you think that it's faulty to base the number of perpetrators on police reports, that's a misunderstanding how all of this works. Women are also likely to under-report and it's impossible to quantify to what extent under-reporting exists for female and male victims and further who does so more. The same study I posted also shows that women are more likely, proportionally, to be arrested for DV than men are. So say what you will about bias towards female toward police, there's research out there that doesn't back that up."

Instead of promoting gay rights, they used the platform to promote themselves with CAFE merchandise.    Imagine my shock to see today that CAFE's ""LGBT Committee"" which didn't exist before it wrote a letter to complain about CAFE losing its permit still has not done a single thing (besides that letter).

Yes, other people have it worse, but if we use that argument the only person who legitimately gets to complain about their oppression is one starving, abused, disabled, gay, poor, fat, and sick black woman from the middle of nowhere Africa. Nobody else gets to complain!  MRAs use this argument all the time. They usually fail to see how this slippery slope argument totally undermines their own points as well- they need to demonstrate compellingly that men now have it worse instead of just allowing both men and women to have problems and accepting it as is. Oppression olympics is incredibly silly and it wastes everyone's time."

The usually line is ""How can you say you care about X, while ignoring the much worse problem in [insert random 3rd world country]"" It's a way of derailing debate, making the activist seem petty, and make the person doing the undermining seem like they occupy the moral high ground (when they really don't care about any of the issues in the first place).    If you're a student, you have a lot more power to enact positive changes on your own college campus, than ending rape in countries thousands of miles away. The fact that you focus on things with your power to change, doesn't mean that you're also ignoring other problems in faraway places. People fighting for change in their own local communities is one of the only ways the world becomes a better place.   The people making these ""Why don't you care about rape in Somalia?"" type of arguments, really don't care about making the world safer for women.

Undoing that damage is important feminism, and I don't know many well versed feminists that haven't come to a similar conclusion, though the fear of white saviors swooping in is definitely justified. However:   The people making these ""Why don't you care about rape in Somalia?"" type of arguments, really don't care about making the world safer for women. If they can get activist to focus on impossible goals, then the status quo will not change.   This is the most important part, I think.   It's just that the critics who keep trying to remind us of that fact are, in general, not Paul Farmer themselves. They are just trying to tear down the opposition and make them look selfish and misguided, all the while doing nothing about the actual problems. Note that this is precisely what MRAs are doing when they ""what about the men"" with many issues as well, trying to tear down a focus on women's perspectives with no intention of doing anything to actually help men."

againstmensrights,37r1xm,maat-ka-re,2,Sun May 31 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"I read the Wikipedia page and checked out their website. It seems like they're basically a men's right ""lite"" organization. I haven't done much research on them, but they don't seem to be of the same vitriolic caliber as AVFM.   However, despite their mission statement to support equality for men and boys, they don't seem involved in any gay rights issues or causes. Most of the things they're involved in seem to be garden variety MRA petty grievances such as fighting for the right of men to ""manspread"" on subways and arguing that college women's studies courses spread misandry.   Therefore, I really don't know why they want to be part of the Toronto Gay Pride Parade other than shameless self-promotion. They don't seem to care about LGBT issues. It's probably a good thing that Gay Pride isn't diluted to point of meaninglessness by allowing groups to participate that don't have anything to do with gay causes."
againstmensrights,37r1xm,carasci,21,Sun May 31 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Look, if we threw out every group marching in pride that didn't have much to do with gay causes, we'd barely have any left.  Do groups march for self-promotion?  Sure.  What's more important, though, is that when they do they're still making a public statement about their values, and that's a good thing.  Public displays of acceptance and values are reassuring to people both inside and outside the LGBT umbrella, and they're particularly important for people who are struggling with or questioning their sexuality - even if an organization's mandate doesn't include active LGBT programs, it's kinda nice to feel like you won't get side-eyed if you come by one day with your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/etc.  I'm not unsympathetic about the idea of Pride being an ""us"" thing, but if we wanted that we'd literally have to start again from square one.  As for the organization itself, their website says they run a men's center which offers counselling, peer support and employment stuff.  Hard to take issue with IMO, and 90% of what I'm seeing here is meaningless guilt by association.  How many feminist organizations would be left standing if we tore down everything that had ever been seen in the same room as a nutball TERF?"

It's an inclusive organization, and there are plenty of groups involved that aren't 100% LGBT activist groups (corporate sponsors are the most obvious example - but their involvement has been the source of controversy as well). It's a big umbrella, for sure, but if a group's mandate or behaviour is seen as antithetical to Pride, they won't be allowed in.  As for ""guilt by association"" - please take a look at the links above. CAFE has hosted talks by Warren Farrell, a notorious rape apologist, and Barbara Kay, a reactionary with an awful track record on LGBT issues. They've repeatedly shown themselves to be dishonest, by lying on their charity application and by marching at Pride last year under false pretences. And one of their board members - again, not someone who they just happened to be in a room with, but a leader of the group - made awful slut-shaming comments on his public Twitter account. Holding an organization accountable for the actions of its members is not ""guilt by association""."

Sure, but there's a big difference between ""not having a lot to do with gay causes"" and ""actively antithetical to Pride's mandate.""  (Also, it goes way beyond just corporate sponsors, my guess is half of the groups I saw last year didn't have a substantial relationship to LGBT advocacy or issues.)   As for ""guilt by association"" - please take a look at the links above.  Holding an organization accountable for the actions of its members is not ""guilt by association"".   I did - you're certainly right that we need to hold organizations accountable.  However, as one of the many people who doesn't consider Manboobz/WHTM/David Futrelle in general to be reliable sources, I followed up with some time on Google.  (Sorry for taking so long, but I've had other things to do and tend to be picky about checking things.  If that wasn't warning enough, this is going to be pretty long, but if I was going to do it I figured I should do it right.)  Sadly, I pretty much found what I was expecting:   The charity application.  If anything was going to torpedo them, that would be it - from what I've seen, the CRA takes the charity process very seriously and I can't imagine them not investigating a complaint like that.  Since they don't seem to have been stripped of their charity status, their own explanation (that the quotes were taken out of context, and from a small portion of a much longer process) seems to hold water. The tweet.  From the two or three sentences that were actually relevant, I can trust the basic premise: he made a genuinely jackass comment on a personal account.  The tweet itself doesn't exist anymore but @s another twitter along with Valenti - I don't know if it was just a retweet of Valenti or actually changes the context, but there isn't much that would justify his response.  Am I okay with it?  No.  On the other hand, I mostly just have to reiterate my last point from before: if we tossed out every feminist organization which had had a major member say something jackass in public, there wouldn't be many left.  As-is, their site doesn't show him as a board member or committee chair any more (I think it has him on a media committee or something, which is admittedly kinda ironic), and there's nothing really connecting the comment to CAFE. The rally.  Now, when I say that I don't trust WHTM to be a reliable source, stuff like this is why: in a couple pages of text, I couldn't find anything whatsoever connecting CAFE to the ""rally"" put on by AVFM besides the sentence, ""Given that most of the opposition made a clear decision to ignore the AVFM/CAFE rally and lecture...""  So I checked the links.  The first one (to AVFM itself) seems to be the only relevant one, and all it says is that the rally ""followed a presentation given by Dr. Miles Groth [for CAFE] at the University of Toronto the night before.""  In other words, the only thing actually connecting CAFE to the AVFM rally is that AVFM stuck their rally after a CAFE event, probably hoping to capitalize on things.  CAFE doesn't seem to have advertised it, promoted it, contributed to it, participated in it, or even acknowledged it besides one quote in a Vice article (which frankly is a hit piece if I've ever seen one) from a spokesman who basically said ""look, we had nothing to do with it and aren't supporting it.""  So yeah.   This basically leaves me with the remainder of what you've said.  I'm actually pretty familiar with what's been said regarding Warren Farrell, but a ways back I also read through an AMA in which he was specifically asked about a bunch of the quotes and whatnot - while I seem to have lost it, I recall him giving a fairly nuanced response.  (Just to be clear, I don't expect you to take my word on it, just explaining why the mention of him doesn't affect my view much.)  The bigger issue with all of them is pretty much what I mentioned before: guilt by association.  Am I comfortable with the speaker lineup?  No, I'm not, and there are definitely some regressive views present there.  On the other hand, I'm loathe to let someone's views on one topic define how I view them on another: I don't judge Stephen Harper's politics by the fact that he's a member of a religious denomination that's basically a doomsday cult, I judge his politics by the fact that they suck.  Similarly, as much as it pains me, I would willingly hire Harper to give an economics lecture if he were the right guy no matter how much his politics suck.  (Actually, scratch that, his politics happen to demonstrate that he sucks at economics but that's really not the point.)  Basically, what I'm asking is whether there's any evidence that things like Kay's LGBT nonsense actually played any part in her (work? relationship?) with CAFE.  If there is, that's a different matter, but I'm not seeing it.  I can't say there isn't some fishy stuff around the edges, but FFS we let the bloody Catholic school board march and we know what they've been up to.  It seems to be a new organization, all the WHTM stuff is almost a year old, and most of the rest seems pretty much circumstantial.  It's not reasonable to throw out a group like that based on a couple of assholes, even important ones (god help us if we looked at the engineering faculties, at least three of which are marching this year) or their association with people who hold nasty views unrelated to that association.  (I mean, it might be nice if everyone could just boycott all the homophobes, but I know that's not a luxury I could personally afford so I can't really blame others for it.)  So yes - at this point I don't really expect to convince you one way or another (and frankly, knowing the sub I'll probably just be banned anyways), but that's what I've come up with.  I noticed this because I'd actually posted an article about the last time this happened - at the time, I was weirded out because Pride seemed to have thrown out their rulebook, so I figured this would fill that in.  Your links definitely go a long way to explaining the ""why"" of the matter, but based on what I've seen I can't really find myself agreeing."
againstmensrights,37r1xm,mdmarty,2,Wed Jun 3 03:14:54 2015 UTC,"You're right; I don't think either of us is going to convince the other. You seem to take a different approach to Pride than I do. (I had no idea the Catholic School Board marched in the parade, and I'm super uncomfortable with that FWIW). I know a lot of people are comparing this to the Queers Against Israeli Apartheid situation, and while I think they are very different there is a common thread: sometimes a group's politics are offensive enough that people don't want to see them march in Pride. You clearly don't think CAFE is particularly offensive; I disagree.   I think CAFE is making an effort to rehabilitate their image, by distancing themselves from AVFM, getting involved with legitimate organizations (like Pride), and trying to do actual activism instead of just hosting lectures on why feminism is terrible. If it works, good for them. As it stands though, their image is terrible. They have a reputation for misogyny, and that reputation is not undeserved. Maybe you don't think that's a good enough reason to keep them out of Pride, but I certainly do, as do many others. Maybe in a few years, CAFE will have fashioned itself as a real charity, doing real stuff to help men (including LGBT men - so far their ""LGBT committee"" has done nothing and seems to exist solely for PR purposes), Kay and Farrell will be forgotten, and they'll have no ties with AVFM. Then I'm sure they'll be very welcome at Pride. Right now? Not so much.  Also, what's so unreliable about Futrelle/AVFM? He makes a point of providing context and citations for everything he posts. Even if you don't like how he frames things, he's clearly not making this stuff up."
againstmensrights,37r1xm,Spawnzer,4,Wed Jun 3 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"You're right; I don't think either of us is going to convince the other.   Fair enough - I'll say my piece and that'll probably be the end of it.  At the very least it'll have generated some useful information for anyone else looking through the thread as well as being a decent civil discussion.   I know a lot of people are comparing this to the Queers Against Israeli Apartheid situation, and while I think they are very different there is a common thread: sometimes a group's politics are offensive enough that people don't want to see them march in Pride.   Sure, but let's not forget that (by my recollection) QAIA was universally allowed to march despite being (IMO) far more worrisome.  That's the precedent: like it or not, Pride has allowed plenty of very questionable groups to march in the name of inclusivity even when doing so presented an outright threat to its funding.  (To some degree I'm on the fence about that, I'll admit, but that's the way it's been and there's no reason this should be an exception.)  Even if you were mostly right about CAFE, I'm still not sure it would rise to that level given that there's no evidence of the organization itself doing anything antagonistic to LGBT interests besides the lack of boycotting.  The reason we feel differently here is probably that I tend to err on the side of caution, and feel that the harm caused by unfairly excluding a group far outweighs the potential harm caused by allowing a group to march that shouldn't.   I think CAFE is making an effort to rehabilitate their image, by distancing themselves from AVFM, getting involved with legitimate organizations (like Pride), and trying to do actual activism instead of just hosting lectures on why feminism is terrible.   Except there doesn't seem to be any actual evidence of them being close to AVFM in the first place, besides what's pretty much unavoidable in a very small world.  That's honestly a big part of why I'm so skeptical about this: every search turns up a litany of claims that CAFE is basically a northern wing of AVFM, yet everything I'm seeing tells me the two have always been pretty much at arm's length (and a steadily widening arm's length at that).  At the very least, I'm not seeing anything remotely conclusive, let alone enough to view that association as sufficient to justify excluding them.   If it works, good for them. As it stands though, their image is terrible.   Not to be blunt, but it's starting to seem to me like most of that ""image"" is third-party mudslinging rather than substance.  The claims I could fact-check seem to be questionable, the ones I couldn't are mostly unsubstantiated, and literally the only thing I can confidently say in all of this is that a bunch of people (many of whom I don't find terribly credible) really don't like them and love connecting them to AVFM.  On one hand, ""where there's smoke, there's fire""; on the other hand, ""enough smoke without fire suggests smoke machines, not invisible bonfires.""   Also, what's so unreliable about Futrelle/AVFM? He makes a point of providing context and citations for everything he posts. Even if you don't like how he frames things, he's clearly not making this stuff up.   Futrelle is usually right about the very basic facts, but his editorializing tends to range from ""sensationalizing and exaggerating"" to ""outright lying"".  Take the charity application thing: the quotes weren't made up, but they were taken so far out of context that they might as well have been.  Were he an actual journalist, running what he did without contacting (for example) the CRA would probably be an outright breach of journalistic ethics.  (Yes, I'm aware that the whole thing didn't start with him, but that's really not the point.)  I'm a fact-checker by nature, and when virtually every time someone's linked me to Futrelle I've found something fishy in the background that's enough for me not to take him at face value.  Also, as a more personal assessment, the guy seems like exactly the kind of asshole who would be writing for AVFM if his views were a bit different; that may not impact his credibility, but it does mean that I typically avoid his site in much the same manner."

I hope they take all the passion, anger and energy they've applied to making college administrators figure out when yes means yes and no means no, and harness it to address problems far beyond their own.    It's funny how people react to rape accusations/trials as if it was something only the victim and her family need so they can heal and not something to punish/lock a criminal. When someone murders someone else, do they also only think about the family's feelings, forgetting some sick fuck is running free outside??? This might sound horrible but as much as I wish rape victims can heal and have a nice life, the thing I actually want the most is punishing/locking rapists: there might be too much of them to handle but it doesn't change the fact they're fucking trash. I feel like people react so lightly to people who sexually assault adults/teens because they think there is a way to avoid them and also because they think some people deserve this crime: be a good girl and nothing will happen of course, and god forbid you don't follow the rules!

Studies show that adults treat babies differently depending on perceived gender. So if you take a baby in a yellow onesie, and say it's a boy, people will say he's strong, independent, etc. Even if it's a girl. And vice versa; she'll be sociable, cute, and need help."
againstmensrights,37hfly,meowmixxed,1 point,Sat May 30 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"But no one on the MRA team seems to take socialization into account.    It's like Christians and free will. They can never take into account biological imperative. For them, to suggest that being gay is innate means that their superficial interpretation of the bible isn't absolutely true. Ignoring the internal contradictions in the text that already exist.  There's a psychologist that I like that says people don't engage in moral reasoning, they engage in moral rationalization. They start with a knee-jerk emotion and work backwards to a seemingly plausible conclusion that justifies the thing they already believe.  MRAs have personally been ""burned"" by something that contradicts the oppressed woman narrative. Like they've had to pay child support despite the fact that they couldn't get custody. As a consequence, they think that men are more oppressed.  It's closer to their nerve so it's more important than something that's so clearly pervasive, historical and systemic. They've now created an excuse for everything. The way that Christians have excuses for their contradictions."
againstmensrights,37hfly,inchoaterica,1 point,Sat May 30 07:03:19 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""science and chromosomes"" argument is intrinsically wound up with the white supremacist-transexterminationist wing of the MRBM. The Jack Barn3s/Dean E$may types who make no apologies about their hate and who tend to skip directly to that hate whenever questioned about something. This is indistinguishable from any other argument about innate traits which automatically make someone better or worse rather than recognizing general patterns that are suggestive rather than forceful.  It also has a much more sinister side, though: the idea that there are innate differences say that some things just aren't the fault of men when they do violent things. This is one of the scarier parts of the MRBM's theology: that there's just some things that men do according to them. This ignores the vast swath of men who don't rape or indiscriminately kill and wires right back to the idea that There Are Some Things That Men Just Do. If you're wondering where you've seen this before, second-wave fauxminism, discredited ""genetic science"" in the past used to repress, etc...oh yeah.  I don't know, maybe I just think better of men than to believe all men are monsters because of ""science"" and ""genetics"", but this would be the same Dean E$may who claims that there's no such thing as an intersex person but has no problem defending people who believe racial segregation is a great idea.  Hell, maybe I think better of white men than to believe that's a good idea. And when I'm the one thinking about the white mens...that really tells you what the MRBM is actually about: the idea that men have no control and need excuses. The idea that ""science"" and ""chromosomes"" are proof of everything. Racial and gender Calvinism, basically."

But as another male victim of sexual violence (molestation not rape though) I can understand why he would say that especially if he doesn't have much of a grasp of feminism.   As he mentioned, there are very few to no avenues for support. It's getting better, obviously, but that's all in the past few years. There was a period of my life where I didn't really call myself an MRA but was against feminism. I'm a feminist now, I'm just trying to explain how I thought back then.  It was born of frustration, of seeing my victimhood denied and mocked. A lot of times in feminist circles people will say things like ""but what about teh menzz"" in response to male victims of rape. This is because people bring it up at the wrong times, try to derail conversations about female rape, but when you're hurting and sensitive about something you don't really process that context. You just see someone mocking your pain, again, except they're also talking about how bad rape culture is. And the perceived hypocrisy pisses you off.  Of course, now I know how much work feminism has done for male rape victims, and how bad toxic masculinity is and all that jazz. But when you're on reddit and most of the exposure you get off feminism is TiA and MR, it's easy to get the impression that feminists don't care about you either. Since the vast majority of people think your rape was a joke, it's not exactly much of a stretch to imagine this other group does as well."

Slowly but surely.  That said TiA and MR only exposing those echo chambers to straw feminism isnt really something that should excuse them. Especially while they still happily consider any rape of a woman a joke or a lie.   Also the reason that whole ""What about the menz?"" thing happens is because its never ever employed to help the male victims of sexual violence. Its used as a silencing tactic. ""Men get raped too"" and whats unsaid is ""So shut up about it."" I can see how this could be a double edged sword when seen by a male victim of sexual assault.  Problem is, thats the extent that MRAs even mention man and rape in the same sentence unless its to claim someone is lying or its Feminists' fault. They dont care about the victims, they use them as a tool against anyone discussing the issues with rape for women.    This is because people bring it up at the wrong times, try to derail conversations about female rape, but when you're hurting and sensitive about something you don't really process that context. You just see someone mocking your pain, again, except they're also talking about how bad rape culture is. And the perceived hypocrisy pisses you off.   Understandable but you see what they dont. Thats the kicker.   The moment I see an MRA say  ""Men get raped"" and there's no ""too"" and its not just a taking a swing at a Feminist I'll believe the MRAs actually give a shit about male sexual assault survivors.

Those who rape men can still be prosecuted just as harshly under sexual assault, though all rape victims - cis men and trans women - should be protected under the same law.  The FBI definition doesn't have any legal weight as it pertains primarily to statistical analysis, which is important but a different issue altogether.

I think it takes a special kind of psycho to read everything that gets posted here on AMR and not conclude that the MRM is dismissively callous towards serious women's issues at best and disgustingly misogynistic at worst.  The problem with r/mr is that it's really just an anti-feminist rage jerk. Whenever I open that sub, pretty much 90% of the posts aren't even for discussing men's issues, but are for complaining about women, feminism, and apologetics about why we shouldn't ever care about any of the problems women experience in society. That alone is enough reason for me to detest the sub. But in addition, even the few times when they are talking about men's issues, they're either just being paranoid (e.g. false rape accusations), or their analysis is incorrect (or nonexistent). For example, male suicide. Men are much more likely to commit suicide, and that's a problem. However, women are actually more likely to attempt suicide. So there isn't necessarily a gender disparity for suicidal tendencies, and if there is it runs the opposite way. Therefore, the solution to the problem would be to somehow keep suicidal men safe from more lethal suicide methods, such as firearms. But r/mr will never analyze this issue in depth like this because it doesn't fit their narrative that men have it so much worse.  And r/mr is, in my opinion, the best the MRM has to offer (read: least awful). That doesn't say much for that subreddit given how awful the wider ""movement"" is. Just listen to people like Paul Elam or Mike Buchanan to see how terrible these people really can be. And of course all the red pill crap which, let's not kid ourselves, has a pretty wide overlap with the rest of the movement.  The thing is, just because they occasionally talk about real men's issues doesn't mean they discuss them on any useful or meaningful level. Why do these issues exist? What can we do about them? The MRM has discarded all the tools suitable for answering these questions. They dismiss key feminist concepts like intersectionality and culturally enforced gender roles. I remember hearing Buchanan say that trying to change culture is like trying to change the weather. The fuck? So culture has stayed completely stagnant the past several millenia? Nobody has ever had a substantial cultural impact? Tell that to MLK. Tell that to Rosa Parks. Tell that to every influential person in history. The MRM claims that equality of opportunity before the law is all that matters, but racism didn't end after Jim Crow. Cultural barriers are real barriers, and denying them is a sure way to stymie any progress in gender equality.  TL;DR The MRM is usually wrong, but clueless and ineffective even when it's right. It's a right-wing reactionary anti-feminist movement, not a place for people seriously trying to work towards gender equality."

By the way, I got my hands on the book that quote from Sally Miller Gearhart is taken from and currently having a look at it. It's quite a disturbing read indeed (and the editors of the book acknowledge that it is in their foreword...): she makes quite a lot of good observations on power structures, advocates the need for radical ecology and the overall reduction of the total population to a tenth of what it was back then, always carefully adopts an anti-imperialist approach to every issue, calls for complete control of women over their bodies... and then the ratio."

This whole movement is supposed to come from women first given that they are ascribed a tighter relationship to (mother) nature (the text is a bit mystical at the beginning) and can therefore only be realised if they have total control over their reproductive rights. Now, the line is never really drawn between whether this relationship is natural or acquired and she even goes to say that it does not really matter: empathy and nurturing are currently female traits and the revolution has therefore to (and will) come from women.  The ratio of 1 to 10 is supposed to emerge from the fact that more and more women will choose merging their eggs over procreating with a man because the thought of raising a child who will, no matter how much anti-sexism he is exposed to at home, become a violent man, an abuser, a rapist, etc. will be unbearable to them. So about 20% of children will come from usual procreation and the rest from egg-merging.  Overall a pretty weird text. Not at all representative of any current feminist movement I have ever come across.

I am equally a man playing God of War as I am having tea parties with my daughter or holding back tears watching an episode of Doctor Who.

It's the same with people who were claiming that Anita Sarkeesian was transphobic because she said that glorifying violence is part of toxic masculinity. ""Masculinity"" is not ""male-ness"", it is a cultural construct designed around the ideal male. And in Western Culture, the ideal male is defined primarily by the ability to do violence. She's not saying ""only men can do violence"", she's saying ""the glorification of violence exists because our society favors masculine behavior, and masculine behavior is represented by the ability to do violence"". It's the same with this author: he wants to point out that masculinity isn't real, but he also wants to say that masculinity IS real, and the anti-feminists aren't masculine.

Is their sense of manhood so fragile that it is honestly threatened by a two-hour car chase flick not being 100 percent male power fantasy reinforcement?

A commitment to marriage is a commitment to have sex (this is why a marriage with no sex is void and can be annulled, even today)   I was curious about this so I looked it up. At least in my state (Illinois) it is only if one person can't have sex (i.e. not just that they didn't have it) and the person seeking the annulment would have to have not known about it at the time of the marriage.   Even then you have to apply for the annulment within a year.   So maybe in some places he's right, but I'm guessing it's fewer and fewer that this is true."

I also firmly disagree that the mere presence of a rape makes a movie or show sexist. I'm currently teaching Things Fall Apart to my 10th graders.

Her story in particular is that she was raped by a friend who she had previously hooked up with (I'm not aware of the exact details but if I recall correctly, it was something like her not wanting to have anal sex and him trying it anyway when she was drunk). She eventually went to get university to ask for help because she couldn't face being around him and they found him not guilty after the usual school trials that never go well for anyone. She was eventually encouraged to go to the police, but they couldn't find enough evidence to prosecute (which is fairly typical in date rape cases). That's when she began speaking out.   There have been other students who have come out accusing the same person of rape, but I don't have any details on that.   This story began to be widely circulated in the MRA circles after the accused spoke out and (shockingly) claimed to be completely innocent. He gave an interview and handed over a bunch of communications between then which led to an article being published which largely focused on his side of the story."

And then in this instance, the ""journalist"" who delved into this story was only interested in cherry picking certain parts of victim's histories with the alleged rapist to make him look innocent, skewed the story heavily in his favor (and even left out one of his alleged victims, the most recent one to come forward), leading to an opinion of, ""Emma never got raped.""  It doesn't matter that it's scientifically proven that trauma alters the way your brain perceives events (such as specific dates and times). It doesn't matter that you might try to be kind to your rapist in order to prevent retaliation. It doesn't matter that there are a million, perfectly reasonable, well-documented reasons why any of this ""counter-evidence"" might not be what they think it is... but they don't care.  Because no matter what, no woman ever gets raped. Ever. They're all lying. Because that's what women do.  Only men get raped when false any accusations are made against them.

I consider myself first and foremost a humanist, and to me that means equality, and unfortunately I see the main push for gender equality from feminists (wish it was driven under a more gender neutral label). Among my friends some are more combatant than others, but I've never met a misandrist. Are they really a problem, or is this more a concept meant to push back on the criticism of misogynists?   I have met misandrists. It's not that they are outgoing with their ideology, but they you see it in their actions. Abusing sexual harassment, custody laws, and fake rape reports. They do exist, they don't have to be a large number to hurt feminism. Just as the men's right movement is now seeing issues of misogyny like the red pill. I'm sure their intentions started with simply helping men's rights but in the end, they attract misogynists. I was to purge hatred and focus on the general goal of both groups, to make all rights equal for all genders.   But what the fuck do these ""misandrists"" have to do with feminism? A woman commits a crime against a man= a ""feminazi"" harming feminism? I mean, are we going to label every male criminal a MRA hurting the MRM now too?  The MRM did not start for men's rights, it probably started out of rage against women's liberation and it's still the same expect now they're even angrier because feminists are (supposedly?) gaining more power to help women.  And I'm sorry but I can't stand this egalitarian attitude: the idea that ""we all have issues"" and you just have to say ""hey let's all get along!"" is pure bullshit, it just ignores each group's specific issues and we all know who refuses to hear about these specific issues..."

That's why this entire line of reasoning is backwards (i.e. looking at wage statistics and trying to figure out which factors are causing the difference).  Speaking as a [male] data scientist, observational studies like these can be credible when the groups you are comparing are very similar and when the number of factors involved is small.  They are not good in cases like these where there are an infinite number of possible explanations.  For cases like these, the only way to really test what's going on is to set up a randomized experiment that isolates the effect of gender discrimination.  Many tests like this have been done, and they all show the same thing: gender discrimination does exist.  For example, they have tried sending the same resume around to many jobs, half the time with a woman's name and half the time with a man's name. And the ones with a man's name is much more likely to be given an interview.  If anyone cares to see it, there are several other examples listed at the bottom of this post: http://metrocosm.com/a-visual-history-of-the-gender-employment-gap/  I am tired of hearing men claim that the wage gap is a myth."

againstmensrights,3636is,Tesla_in_the_house,15,Sat May 16 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, feminism would like to ban all skirts based on the uncomfortable sexual feelings men might have for underage girls.  I get why an adult man would feel uncomfortable telling a girl her skirt is too short though. The sexual objectification is just there, rooted in our culture, and it can be uncomfortable having to enforce dress code policies.   But I think the solution involves looking at school dress code policies not as protecting modesty or something but just as a semi-professional code of conduct. I shouldn't wear clubbing outfits to my grad seminars, girls shouldn't wear party length skirts to school. Not because of sex, just because of business casual.   Then enforcing dress code comes less as ""You look too sexy for school"" and more as ""hey, we're here to teach you how to function one day in the professional world, please follow the dress code.""

againstmensrights,3636is,she-stocks-the-night,17,Fri May 15 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no. The biggest issue I have with the professionalism argument is that as it currently stands, there is a huge double standard and inconsistency in how it's applied. The idea of professionalism as the reasoning behind these dress codes falls flat when you examine what is allowed such as hoodies, band shirts, men's gym shorts, etc. It really isn't about professionalism as it is about policing (mainly) young women's bodies or at least policing modesty but rarely anything else other than profane graphics and hats. A good many of the items considered okay by most school's standards would be entirely inappropriate in most workplaces, regardless of how modest they are in terms of covering up."

If a father decides to not give a child up for adoption, he can require that the mother provide financial support. And in that, the system is equal and fair.  I mean on some level I do get the point that MRAs make (Hey, even a broken clock is right twice a day). The choice to have an abortion can be one made out of fiscal responsibility. A woman can decide she's not financially ready to be a parent and choose that path. It is an extra avenue to express responsibility that men don't have.  A man can't correct for a mistake he made in the way that a woman can.   Would it not be considered be responsible to state up front ""I am not capable of taking up the financial responsibility for this child"" at which point the woman can decide if she can take the responsibility alone or if she might want to take another action like giving up a child for adoption or having an abortion.

Up front by meaning before they have sex? Maybe, but that isn't practical. This would essentially require a written contract and that just isn't going to happen.   If it is after sex when they know of the pregnancy then it's just plain giving the guy the right to abandon a child and put the onus on the woman altogether, which isn't right since even an abortion has a number of health risks included. Abortion isn't just a casual and risk-free option that a woman can just take.   I can empathize with the perception of unfairness when a man doesn't have the option of getting out of the responsibility for a potential child that a woman does, but I haven't seen a policy suggestion that makes sense and doesn't just provide incentive for men to just abandon women to the real responsibilities and risks involved."

I don't know where I stand on this issue because I haven't really had the opportunity to explore the whole picture. It's important for me to understand the complete argument before deciding what is fair.   Up front by meaning before they have sex?   No, I mean after the fact. Abortion is a decision that happens after one realizes one is pregnant.   Abortion isn't just a casual and risk-free option that a woman can just take.   But fiscal responsibility is one reason why a woman might choose to have an abortion. For a guy to be up front and say ""I'm not capable of being financially responsible for a child"" and informing her in a timely fashion, a woman can choose her options and ""timely"", I mean within the same amount of time that a woman has to choose to abort a child.  It's about owning up to a mistake and laying the cards on the table.  Certainly the guy couldn't abandon his financial obligations to the woman herself during her time of pregnancy and I would include that if a woman chose to take a child to term for the purposes of giving it up for adoption that any cost she might incur, the man would be responsible for as well. That's the cost of the mistake itself. This is an important qualifier. This is both the cost of the mistake itself.  The child after the fact is quite different. I already laid out the legally responsibilities of adoption and those are fair. Because a man can obligate a woman to financially support his child that she would otherwise give up for adoption, then it's reasonable that a woman can obligate a man to financially support her child that he would otherwise give up for adoption. It's fair and equitable.   men to just abandon women to the real responsibilities and risks involved.   Owning up to a mistake is not abandoning responsibility. I think it's being frank and honest about the situation.  The difference between men and women at the time of pregnancy is that women can compensate for a mistake. She can take the risk and have an abortion (as she should be able to) where as for the guy, the mistake isn't correctable.  It should be a smaller window of opportunity as to minimize the risk to the woman's health. So she has time to make a decision."

Owning up to a mistake is not abandoning responsibility.   Owning up to a mistake includes taking responsibility. Stating that you are unable to handle it and abandoning a woman to take the risk of pregnancy or abortion alone isn't taking responsibility or owning up to it, it's abandoning your responsibility.

I fully support a woman choosing abortion for no other reason that ""they don't want to deal with it"".   On some level gender equality needs to take every responsibility to ensure that both women and men have the same opportunities. Abortion, while I think it's ABSOLUTELY a woman's right, does create a significant inequality.   abandoning a woman to take the risk of pregnancy or abortion alone isn't taking responsibility or owning up to it, it's abandoning your responsibility.

She is left with the decision to take the health risks of an abortion or the health risks of the full pregnancy and the responsibility of raising the child - alone.   If a woman aborts then there is no risk for the man whatsoever. He's left with no risks and no real added responsibilities.   Do you see the difference there?    I'll quote myself because I think I was being clear:   What you stated is only a minor amount of the real cost. Basically you are saying that the man should be able to saddle the woman with the vast majority of the risk and the cost of having a child at his whim.   It also doesn't address how this would be enforced. How would you force a man to support the woman during her pregnancy? How would you enforce any of that? If the guy chooses to not pay any of it then the woman is faced with trying to sue him for the costs that she would incur, which is not a cheap process in itself."

againstmensrights,35trtf,Defenestratio,2,Thu May 14 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think their culture covertly encourages and expects autistic behaviors in a lot of ways. Look at just how they think autism is a free pass to epic levels of engineering knowledge, and the endless speculation about how everyone from Einstein to Jobs was autistic (two vastly different individuals). Some places do mandatory training for engineers that's basically like ""here's how to behave yourself in public"" as if it's expected that they don't know this, even though there's no way that the majority of a profession could be autistic. And then I constantly hear engineers saying things like ""I can't remember names because I'm an engineer"" (then who trusted you to do basic tasks?). It's this really weird myth in geek culture."

You lept before you looked kiddo.  So 'these people are sick in the head' that you typed? You mean you and yours.  Now frantically clean up your comment and thread out of embarrassment.    For laughs, Here's his comment in case he deletes it.   This reminds me of the way they blamed the bi lufthansa pilot who deliberately crashed his plane on MRAs.  They know precisely fuck-all about the motives of the killer so they just assume it was a nefarious MRA led conspiracy. Same with Eliot Rodgers and Breivik and all the rest.

For marginalized, oppressed or discriminated groups (e.g. LGBTQ, PoC, women and so forth) ""spaces"" have played a large role in struggles for societal change. For example, in the days of the civil rights movement black churches provided a space and for the early feminist movement womens' groups provided the same. ""Safe spaces"", ""sequestered social sites"", ""zones of cultural autonomy"" or whatever you call them can be locations in which existing relations of domination and hegemony are challenged or maybe you can even get rid of them.   Take the womens' groups in the 70's. Finally women could gather and discuss their lived experiences of sexism. My mother told me stories about her women's group and how for once, finally, they could articulate the feeling every one of them had after political meeting when the talk was over and they were expected to do the dishes while the men drank beer. It didn't take long for them to demand equality in dishwashing.  This is what spaces can do. Even though they are not political as such (like TwoX) they can be considered ""proto-political"" in that they open a space for discussing lived experiences (misogyny, violence, discrimination, rape and so on). And this is what pisses the MRAs and dudebros off.  By continually derailing every discussion with ""that happens to men as well"", #notallmen and so on they effectively close both the discussion and the space. It threatens them (and their privilege) that in some spaces they are not the center of attention and that for once they don't get to decide the agenda. They don't want social change."

Also, not really about this video and its message but I don't understand these people who don't get that there are certain types of racism and sexism that are much worse than others, for their contexts but also their consequences. What's the problem with considering this? What's with the postmodernist jerk attitude? Like there are visible biases in society but why is it so hard for some people to consider there are cultural and social tendancies behind them? Are they just scared these tendancies could disappear (or worse, reverse) or do they believe it's just ""nature""?  I want to ask them sometimes, but these people are either the angry TRP/MRA i-don't-want-to-hear-anything asshole type or just people throwing statistics around: is there hope for debate when one believes in a reality that is the opposite of yours and the other doesn't want to analyze or criticize something indepth?  Anyway, I feel like these people haven't really tried to understand the ""other side"" so I don't really bother with them but I assume they have spent too much time on the internet, especially tumblr, and became even more biased than they already were after bad experiences or out of jealousy (although it's true ""SJWs"" circlejerks can be pretty ugly, I consider the fact it is in response to much uglier and more powerful irl circlejerks)."

I dunno, seems a bit ironic that you have a problem with people complaining about certain kinds of activists when meanwhile your subreddit is dedicated to doing exactly that.   edit: oh you edited your post. I don't believe people of today should have to atone for the sins of their forefathers. What you have today is a medium oriented towards straight men (as they mostly consume it), with a number of female NPC's portrayed sexually in certain adult games, and sometimes a little bit of optional violence towards them. However, 95%+ of all mandatory violence is done towards men in these games, and in some of these games there are sexualized men as well as, or instead of women. Female sexuality in gaming is more prominent, certainly. But violence against men and this idea of the ""disposable male"", which correlates with the history of men-and their own ""oppression"" (if you'd pardon the term), is definitely more prominent. The idea that men could be drafted into war, be last out a burning building or a sinking ship, be expected and demanded to put women's lives first in any situation of danger, is certainly one side of history I think you are overlooking. Few men have ever taken issue with this representation in games though, because these are not real life and thank god, we live at a time and place in the world where this oppression does not exist (unless you live in areas of Africa or the middle east, in which case, I take that back). I don't know how many of these people are MRA, and I don't suppose you do either."

Yes, SBA recognizes women-owned business as a small business concern that deserves preferential treatment when it comes to government contracts and small business loans. But SBA also recognizes a whole host of other small business concerns such as veteran-owned, disabled vet, and HUB-zones (inner city) businesses deserving of assistance. In the end, SBA probably helps men as much, if not more, than women. In fact, when trying to reach our small business sub-contracting quotas, finding women-owned businesses to hire has been the most challenging.   The author tries to point out how SBA ""meddles"" with male owned businesses.

While I don't agree with a lot of what the MRA on reddit do, and really don't have anything against feminism, I felt the need to reply to this because I think this is a common misconception that women have about the draft and selective service. If that gets me banned or downvoted, so be it.   The whole selective service system isn't an issue because we're worried about there being another draft. It's a symbolic issue. Everywhere we're told we have to man up, be strong, aren't allowed to be afraid, etc, and the fact that we have to sign a registry when we turn 18 agreeing to go to war is just the perfect example of this as enshrined in actual law. It's hurtful, lets us know that our opinions and fears don't matter, and that our body is officially and legally property of the state once we turn 18.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried when lying in bed the night after signing myself up. As a teenage boy in high school who already had pretty low self-esteem, it made me feel utterly worthless and crushed me. It was basically telling me my life wasn't worth any more than a few feet on a battlefield, at a point in my life where I already believed I was worthless and it was only really confirming my fears. It hurt, like hell.  If you want to consider it, imagine if women were required to sign a registry agreeing to give birth to and raise children if the population of America ever started hitting a dangerous low. Now, assume everyone knows that there will always be enough mothers willing to do this voluntarily, but you still have to sign the registry. How do you feel when people laugh at you and say that you should stop complaining because it will never actually happen? Would it be any better if this was a law voted into place exclusively by patriotic women during the world wars?

Not true. My workplace does court advocacy for all genders. And we  provide housing support and occasionally HUD money for men and children. We just actually haven't had any men approach us about it. Most of the men we work with are childless or homeless without children, which does not qualify them for HUD money.   Also, because of new language in VAWA, all shelters will be required to provide equal service to men and women. So this mandate is good because yes, men's services are not as frequently available, but also difficult because now we have to figure out how to safely have men in our shelter safely. Also, we are likely to have empty male beds than cannot be given to women even if they're physically open because of the mandate. It's definitely a good thing for an increase in male survivor services, but not when it's at the expense of womens' services. :-/"

Libertarianism arose in the 1970s when women, gays, blacks etc. had finally started to enter the political arena. The government was no longer totally of, by, and for straight white males anymore. Now that they'd lost control of government, they decided to destroy it to prevent any erosion of their privileges. This is when the ""small government"" catechism on the right arose.   Under Libertarianism, everyone's on an ""equal playing field"", which means white males get to retain the massive advantages they've accrued over the centuries.

With all things, sometimes there needs to be medical intervention. So sometimes, it's warranted.  That said.   MRAs abuse the issue in their zero=sum game to justify their rhetoric that men have it equally as bad as women by denying that FGM is a uniquely female form of oppression.

One of the feminist arguments is that single mothers do not make as much money. I feel the reason for this has more to do with choices, than sexism, but that is an argument for another day. If a single mother has less money to support her kids, it seems reasonable that she hasn't been able to save for college for her kids. If later in life she marries, her kids do not benefit from those years of being broke and lack of savings, and will now qualify for less aid.   There is nothing inherently sexist about the FAFSA rule, as it could easily pertain to single fathers as well. Lastly, you must include income from the primary parent, any child support, and the new step parent. This to me will disqualify many people from receiving aid who's parents have been unable to save for them."

Denial of a privilege was always the intent and purpose of barring women from registering for selective service.

But I doubt your story will change their minds because they'll say, ""look you found a way to get an abortion after all."" The problem is with the way they claim ownership over women's bodies.   One of the common MRA talking points is the inherent unfairness that women can get an abortion without the consent of the unborn child's father. They want to change the laws so a woman needs to seek the father's permission before terminating a pregnancy. The other common talking point is the inherent unfairness that they cannot force the mother into getting an abortion when a pregnancy inconveniences them, thus they argue that men should have an option to have a ""financial abortion.""  In both situations, MRAs claim that men should have ownership of women's bodies, whether it is to prevent an abortion or coerce one. I don't think arguing that abortions are hard to get in some states will change their minds. They'll just insist that women fly to another state, or get a back alley abortion, or take some pills they bought on the internet. And the MRAs who want the father's permission before terminating a pregnancy will never make it easier for women to have safe, easy access to abortions.   What needs to be challenged is that men have a right to make decisions on behalf women and their bodies. Bodily integrity is the most basic human right, and MRAs show a deep lack of respect for it."

againstmensrights,34c70j,yelirbear,1 point,Wed May 6 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"No.   While access to and affordability of abortion in the US is a major argument against LPS, there are bigger and better concerns.   -If the parents aren't responsible, who is? If the gov't were to say parents are not naturally, primarily and directly responsible for their biological children then there would have to be another default responsible party unless it was legal to just let the baby die of neglect. Who and how? And why? How can the parent(s) sign away a third party's right to support?   -No one should be coerced into having any medical procedure done.   -Abortion isn't opting out of parenthood. It's the choice to not remain pregnant. It's not a choice afforded to women for any other reason than to not be pregnant if they do not want to be, no questions asked.  -If a woman gives birth, she has the same rights (generally speakng, unless the father doesn't take any action or if either parent has good reason to be denied rights) and responsibilities as the father. Although it may seem unfair because the father can't choose abortion, firstly the pregnancy is not in his body,  and it is fair in the end because both parents end up with the same rights and responsibilities to the child. It's less fair to coerce someone into abortion, force them to gestate or deny support for your own child. Even if you see child support as evil it is certainly less evil than forced abortion, forced pregnancy or forcing a child to go without its due support.  -How is it reasonable to legally bind a father to a decision to relinquish all rights to a child before it is even close to being born? As far as I know, even surrogate  and potential adoptive mothers (and fathers) still have the right to keep the baby after birth. They cannot make a binding contract to give up the child until after birth. This seems much more reasonable than the former potential scenario-giving up rights before birth.  -How do we make a system where men can be properly notified of a child in time? Wouldn't women have to submit to monthly pregnancy tests to avoid any fraud on her part (hiding a pregnancy til it's too late)? Would men be required to leave contact information with every woman he has sex with so he can be informed?   -Would we require people to use, and prove use of, birth control if they invoke LPS? How would this be proven, what court has time for this, what about when b.c. fails? Child suffers because condom broke? Mother forced into abortion, single parenthood when b.c. fails, or child foisted upon the gov't?"

Most people probably don't use phone books anymore but still...I live in a very rural area where they are still valid.   So onward in my search...I find I have to drive either 90 miles to Lexington or 90 miles to Knoxville TN to get this done. That's the closest. Lexington will cost me $650, Knoxville is $530. I am going to Knoxville...they only do the procedure on Mondays and Fridays so I had to plan around that. We make too much to qualify for any assistance but not exactly enough to be able to comfortably afford this. If we hadn't just received a tax refund I'd be screwed.  I'm lucky I have a supportive husband and just enough money to pay for this or else I'd be having a kid in a few months, not by choice. I feel so hard for women who aren't as ""lucky"" as me. It is sooooo hard to get an abortion for so many women and it makes me sick to hear these MRA's saying ""just abort""...alluding to how easy it is not just in choice but in actually getting it done. Financially, time-wise, missing work, arranging childcare, driving a long distance, the unpleasantness of it all, walking past the protesters, recovering....it's not easy even with support.  I'll be making a donation to help women who can't afford this when I go for my appointment even though I can't really afford to but it's so needed."

It's crazy that MRA's treat abortion so casually...I mean, not even talking about the choice itself (realz over feelz, ya know) but the fucking reality of getting an abortion done-it's not easy, readily available or affordable. They act like cuz it's legal it's also a viable option for most. And any woman who doesn't abort is freely choosing to be a parent. No. Just...no. Any woman who goes through with a pregnancy wanted to be a parent. No. Maybe she had no other option due to no access to abortion. That doesn't mean it's ok to deprive the child of support.  There's just so much wrong with financial abortion. The limited access to actual abortion is just one of many counterpoints."

That said, there are countries where there's a mandatory military service in effect, and I'd love to see them stop. what's more, i'd love to see a complete dismantling of the military-industrial complex, mind you, but there's a number of cost-benefit things that need to be worked out to replace it to drive some of the areas of development it tends to fund as a side-product. Of course, there are things that aren't being focused on because of the military-industrial funding, so there's that too."

For all their concerns about unjust convictions, you'd figure they'd be enraged at ""failure to protect"" laws, which require women  somehow suspect everyeone even when wrongdoing is concealed, and often serve to punish women more severely than the men who actually injure their children.  Andrea Yates' husband deliberately took away her meds and demanded she shape up, leaving her alone with the kids. She promptly killed them at Satan's orders.  If he were a woman, he'd have been charged with failure to protect. Gary Tinning stood idly by while his wife Mary Beth killed eight of his and her biological children and then tried to kill an adopted child. He was never charged, but you can bet if he were a woman he'd have been.  If Susan Smith had been Steven Smith and a girl had dumped him after his lifetime of abuse, the girl would have been an accessory somehow.  It's funny how Susan Smith is a famous name but Charles Stewart and Charles Rotherberger aren't.    These guys look at actual facts and declare that assessing and abiding by actual facts, if it results in less than happy treatment for men is MISANDRY.  They claim they want equal treatment; what they really want is for men to do whatever they want and get away with it."

This shows such a poor understanding of history. Many, many women worked in farms, dangerous factories and even coal mines. Only wealthy women could afford to stay at home comfortably. If a woman's husband was working in a coal mine, there is no way she would have had a comfortable life and probably would have been working herself.  And even the middle class women who didn't have to work outside the home still had enormous amounts of difficult housework to do. Laundry, cooking and keeping the house clean were laborious all-day  tasks."

So this ramble below is my attempt to square staring == sexual harassment and adjust my misogynistic worldview.  It is ugly, poorly written ... but I think I am starting to get there.   SUPER EDIT  So you are equivocating sexual harassment and ""impolite behavior""?  That seems not quite right.    But I think that staring at another human should be viewed as someone trying to dominate another person ... just like when other mammals do it.  Staring is a lot more nuanced that just sexualized harassment.  But I am interested in why it is sexual harassment.  Because I have seen women stare men down.  To me it is just dominance play.  Is it because men can stare down and back it up with physicality?  Because I have seen women disregard size difference and assault men pretty regularly.  I see female partners slap and jab at males at malls, movie theaters, restaurants and in public all the time.  Not in a mean spirited way.  But I see it all the time.  And the stare can be sexualized.  I think that the male gaze is a useful expression to help men gain access to the subject.  I still find my head on a swivel at very inappropriate times.  And when I get a disapproving look ... I feel both badly and angrily.  So I do admit that is problem with me.  And I'm not sure how to find something to catch it personally every time.  So I guess I understand how time and time again trying to guess if it is ""male gaze"" or some other shit it would become tiresome.  That said in my 20s I got lots and lots of attention from gay men.  And I loved it.  But the analogy isn't one to one.  The power play between men and men vs men and women isn't the same.  All of this is so complicated.  It gets so complicated that it begins to feel external to what I want to do  which is find common ground to hang out and enjoy life at with other people.  But I cam remember my dad staring me down constantly at dinner or watching tv or anything really.  i would ask him to stop and he wouldn't.  he was trying to minimize me through glaring and staring.  So I can see it now.  I can see how staring can be sexual harassment."
againstmensrights,3398xh,Alternating_Sum,10,Tue Apr 21 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"I still find my head on a swivel at very inappropriate times. And when I get a disapproving look ... I feel both badly and angrily. So I do admit that is problem with me. And I'm not sure how to find something to catch it personally every time.   There's nothing inherently wrong with admiring a stranger who you find attractive.  When I do it I try to be subtle, since not everyone wants to be made aware of every stranger's lustful thoughts when they're going about their business.  But I think it's pretty normal to slip up occasionally and check someone out more overtly than you meant to, and it's not the worst thing in the world.    These are two types of staring I would consider sexual harassment (and yes, women can absolutely do it to men, I just don't think they do as often):    -Staring at a stranger at great length, longer than a few minutes.  (Once I was doing some work at a coffee shop, and a man I'd never seen before stared at me for about an hour straight.  At one point I moved to a different seat, and he moved as well, seemingly so he could keep staring at me.  I interpret that as threatening behavior, personally.) -Overtly staring at someone's breasts, butt, or crotch, at length.  (Overt meaning they can see you doing it, at length meaning more than a brief, unconscious head swivel.)    On the other hand, sometimes strangers look at each other in a mutual, flirtatious way.  This isn't sexual harassment because it's mutual.  For example, if you glance at an attractive stranger, and they glance back at you and smile.  Maybe then you smile back, and then they turn towards you with relaxed, open body language.  Maybe then you ask them about the book they're reading, and they tell you about it enthusiastically.  You can tell it's a mutual interaction because there's give and take every step of the way, it's not just one person imposing a relentless stare on someone else."
againstmensrights,3398xh,psirynn,5,Tue Apr 21 06:03:17 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. Men staring at women because they believe they have a right to (if you do feel flattered by gay men staring at you, you are alone; other straight men have -murdered- gay men, or come very close, for such ""infractions"" against them) is a different beast from any other form of staring, because we exist in a culture in which men pretty regularly assault women. Women are expected to be aware of their surroundings and view attention from male strangers as a threat. So it isn't merely ""impolite"", it can actually be terrifying. Men know this, but disregard it as unimportant, compared to their ""right"" to gawk. It makes women extremely uncomfortable, and if it happens in a space from which they can't easily remove themselves (like a workplace), it creates the same climate of hostility and fear and difference of power that any other form of sexual harassment does. But without it being considered sexual harassment, it's something women just have to put up with. They can't complain to anyone. They can't confront the starer, that would be ""disruptive"", and they might even be accused of harassment themselves. They just have to take it, until they can't take it anymore, and then they have to leave a space they have every right to. My point in commenting was to show that staring -- actual staring, the sort of prolonged staring that can actually reasonably get you caught -- is not beyond your control like many MRAs claim. Children, not exactly paragons of self-control, are expected to control themselves and their natural curiosity for the sake of manners and not making others feel uncomfortable. And they do. It's one of the easiest lessons taught to young children. It took one time of my mother explaining to me that you don't stare because staring is rude and it makes other people think there's something wrong with them when it's actually you who has a problem for me to just not do it. Do I forget on occasion? Sure, momentarily. And then I remember and stop doing it. Because unlike men who stare at women, I care about the comfort of the people around me.  I'd point out that we are not other mammals. Smiling is not a show of aggression, dancing isn't a substitute for fighting, and we don't regularly challenge our bosses to fights in order to get promoted. When someone stares at another person, they are not challenging them. Indeed, they're often pretty shocked if the stare-ee reacts in any way, let alone by becoming aggressive or loud or hostile. Before they were complaining about staring being sexual harassment, a common complaint of misogynists was when women said -anything- about being stared at. If they screamed at them or cussed them out, they were a ""crazy bitch"", but even complaining after the fact was going too far. You really think they're viewing it the same way other animals do? If so, it's so far removed from a non-sexual show of ""dominance"" that it's almost unrecognizable (shows of dominance are pointless if they cannot be challenged, basically).   It's really not that complicated. Men think their right to stare at tits or ass in public, as opposed to in the privacy of their home, is more important than women feeling safe. This is a continuation of the notion that men, very specifically, have a right to women, very specifically, by default, unless another man challenges them. If they view the objects of their attention as not-objects, they can make themselves not do it. And a lot of guys don't do it. The ones who continue have made their priorities very clear, and they are knowingly making their work or school or whatever else environment unhealthy and unproductive for women. They just don't care."

A bunch of wealthy white men patting each other on the back for being smart enough to work out god doesn't exist while being willfully and proudly ignorant of literally anything other hard science (and sometimes even that). I think a lot of their sexism (and racism and classism) comes from their idea that religion is the major cause of social problems, which means they can ignore the effects of colonialism, patriarchy, material conditions, etc. (e.g. problems in the middle east are just because religion makes people crazy, or because Islam is a particularly dangerous religion - forget social and historical context).  These people were righteously skewering the Catholic church for its cover-ups of sexual abuse. But when reports of bad behaviour start coming out of the atheist community, these people (both big names and followers) behave exactly like the fucking church - closing ranks around the accused, blaming the victims, trying to silence them, accusing anyone who talks about it of witch hunts or trying to destroy the movement.   And what's with the fucking authoritarian hero worship among these ""free thinkers""? Any criticism of Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris etc. is met with outrage and accusations of crypto-fundie-ism.

Thus, if a complaint is made against someone the group holds up, unless said group is really good about interrogating that tendency, they'll circle the wagons to protect the shittiest behavior as long as the one who committed it is ""one of us.""  It's not just a religious thing, or a MRA thing. I've even seen some feminist groups that fall prey to that trap. Hell, I've even been part of it, letting shitty, abusive behavior, things that made me uncomfortable, etc. go in the name of intra-group peace.

Source?  I've worked at prominent universities where atheists are everywhere. The atheist communities there (at least where I worked) were comprised equally of both men and women. I actually never looked at the demographics (male/female) of the numbers for the actual universities, but I don't care. It's inconsequential.    Any criticism of Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris etc. is met with outrage and accusations of crypto-fundie-ism   I have seen Dawkins in person. I've shaken his hand. He's a decent guy, and his research isn't too bad. However, I don't agree with his method of being cold towards those who hold faith. I consider myself an atheist in practice, but don't think being a dick to people will ever change anyone's mind (on the contrary, in fact).  As for Sam Harris, I've listened to him a bit. Unfortunately I can't speak one way or another as I'm a bit less familiar with him.  But as for Christopher Hitchens, I've listened to much of his youtube videos. I've read several of his and Dawkins' books. Both are good writers. I agree with Hitchens on more than one level, and would like to be pointed in the direction of a video showing his misogyny. IIRC, he was a man who has said that (I'm loosely quoting here as it's from memory), ""We know there's only one cure for poverty: the empowerment of women. If you give a woman some control over her reproductive system and raise them to social equality with men, everything in a country will improve as a result.""   I used to scoff at religious people who call atheism just another religion, but now I think they have a point.   Atheism, like any other belief system, will have a percentage of its members who are ""militant"" or really gung-ho about what they believe (whether they have good reasons too or not). The question then is, what constitutes a ""good"" reason to believe in anything?   Edit: If you guys are downvoting me because you disagree with what I say, then it shows that you can't back up any of the claims you've made, or are too lazy to actually have an argument using any reasoning at all. So, which is it? Are you lazy or are you blindly following this sub's conventions?

Every statistic ever says men rape and kill too much. Feminists point to toxic masculinity and male entitlement to explain and address this gendered disparity in violent crime. But Doh! But some of the victims of violent crime are also men. So in recognizing that toxic masculinity is the cause of their victimization, we've just blamed male victims for their own victimization. What a fuckup on our part!   Except we didn't accuse the victims of exhibiting toxic masculinity, we accused the perps (and not even all of them). It's instructive that the only way MRAs can deflect the gendered nature violent crime is by intentionally confusing victim and perp.   Care to try again 5th Law?

The reason I agree that accused rapists names need to be private is because I've seen some people's lives be destroyed by false allegations of rape before.  If a person is accused of rape, that's it. They can no longer get a steady job, they may lose part or all of their friends or family and may in some cases commit suicide. Of course, not all rape accusations are false--most of them are true. But to release the names of all who are accused? That's a whole different beast.   The same thing is true for people who are falsely accused of child molestation or molestation or anything ""sexual"" attached to the name.   Even if a man is exonerated, his reputation will never be the same as it once was. If the man did the crime, then he deserves all of the bad things I mentioned above. If he didn't and his suffering was a direct result of a false accusation, false police report or something similar, then I think it's fair to say that if his name hadn't been released before the fallacies in the report were found, his life would have been alright."

The overwhelming majority of accusations are true. Given the ubiquitous and ever-growing rape culture we live in, it makes sense to treat all accusations of rape or sexual assault as real, because to dismiss real rapes due to a few fringe cases (again, where the women involved were almost certainly suffering abuse of some kind) is exactly what the misogynists want, so rape can continue to be used as a form of oppression against all women by all men.  Edit: Whoah, I thought I was on the other sub, not MensRights. I must have misread that graphic at the side, it must actually say ""Misogyny Time.""

The overwhelming majority of accusations are true.   This statement is naive. Have you considered relationships that have gone bad, where the woman in a hetero relationship decides to give her boyfriend an ultimatum like, ""If you leave me, I'm going to tell the cops you raped me.""  We have the justice system as well as common sense and reasoning to know that treating all accusations as true is a very, very slippery slope. We know this not only because of what a rape accusation can do to a person's credibility and reputation, but what any sort of ""sexual"" allegation can do.  Although I agree they should be taken seriously, a means of quality control for the alleged ""victim"" should be in place (such as police interrogations to repeat ""the story"" of what happened). In several cases, women have been found to manipulate their SOs into staying in relationships with them or blackmailing them in some way with a rape accusation.   Now, of course what I'm saying here does not apply to all reports. I'd say that the majority are certainly true.    so rape can continue to be used as a form of oppression against all women by all men.   This is hyperbole, and is ridiculous. How can you be so naive? Men get raped just as women do. Yes, there are more reported cases of men raping women, but think about what reporting a rape for a man must be like. Imagine the shame, the embarrassment of saying that you're a male (in a society where men are supposed to be ""strong"" and ""big"" and ""bulky"" and ""manly"") and have been raped.

Seriously - any guy who says shit like this guy said, even on a smaller scale, is basically a rape-apologist who is just an assault waiting to happen, or more likely has been victimizing women and children (this dude was at a high school?

Why would he, when society teaches him to treat women as objects?  There's an easy test for a guy. Get him to publicly state that he knows we live in a rape culture and that he understands that toxic masculinity and patriarchy is the cause, and that he has no voice when it comes to talk about rape statistics - all men have no voice about that, it's not for them to deny or even affirm, it's their job (if they are to be allies) to be silent and listen.

againstmensrights,32zc3o,IrbyTremor,8,Sat Apr 18 00:05:14 2015 UTC,"Edit: Sorry for the long rant, but the document below is what interests me.  A whole lotta MRAs in that comment section spouting the all-too-common ""NotAllMRAs."" They seem to think that if some good people are led to believe that the MRM helps men, that their entire movement is justified in social justice. Yet, many of them constantly oust feminist beliefs because of all the ""evil feminists"" that have plagued the front page of r/videos.  I don't doubt that there are some good people who have joined the MRM in search for justice for men, and some people have contributed to good causes that identify as MRAs. But, lumping all the eternal goals of the MRM and it's members calls for an environment that would be more toxic for both men and women as a whole. In the end, the only people who will win are the ""Alphas"" if we were to shift to the ""dog eat dog"" society that they consistently fantasize about in the Man-babysphere.  What's almost as hilarious is the ""proof"" that's been spammed in that comment section. This pdf brings up many good points and ideas that would help men as a whole. However, many of these ideas are things that your typical MRA would actively work against. Let's dive in:   More education must be provided on non-violent conflict resolution models and men's work that applies to non-violent solution models must be supported and developed (page 24)   If you recall, there was a recent thread on r/Memesrights that claimed it was unfair to try and change young boys' behavior in order to prevent cases of hyper-masculinity. Misters argued that by doing this, we would be treating boys like ""broken girls,"" as if we were forcing young men to adopt what they consider to be feminine traits.   The media, entertainment and gaming industries will be challenged to take part in work to change and diversify the male image (page 24)   This would go against what gamergate stands for. That is, social criticism of videos games and a look into how they reflect and affect the developers and consumers involved. That would be treating them like an art-form, which is ""unethical.""   Purchasing of sex must be criminalized (page 24)   Good luck   Police statistics show that 78–89 per cent of perpetrators of violent crimes, depending on their level of severity, are men. However, violence is not just a men’s problem. Malespecific violence requires male-specific measures, which must cover everything from preemptive measures, intervention and after care. (page 23)   I'm honestly beginning to think this was written by a feminist, or at least, an ""egalitarian."" It acknowledges that the majority of crimes are committed by men, but doesn't blame it on women or feminists. Rather, it's saying that there's something wrong with the way men are brought up in society, and that it can be rectified (to an extent) if we focus on a cultural change.   We must intervene in violence against boys and carried out by boys. (page 23)   We can all agree on the first part. MRAs tend to scoff when hearing about the second one.   Labour force services and the participation of both men and women in these services must be analysed from the gender perspective, and services must be developed to correspond with the needs of men and women, not in a gender-blind manner. (page 23)   Remember that thread that complained about women in the military, a STEM field, etc? The ones that say they should ""suck it up"" instead of taking a look into how different sexes are treated to improve worker life?   Actions that will see men gaining an interest in jobs within fields that have traditionally been considered female professions and their employment in these fields must be supported. (page 23)   Remember all those threads that say women should work more dangerous jobs to ""see how it is,"" rather than encouraging men to work in [what they consider to be less-lucrative] healthcare and social welfare fields? Because God forbid...   In addition to male and female-dominated fields and professions, segregation is evident in the greater share of men in top management positions. (page 19)   Interesting. It's saying that some fields are more difficult to enter due to one's gender, and acknowledges that men make up a large part of top-management positions. Flat-out misandry amirite?   Developing family leave legislation further to support the inclusion of fathers more than before  (page 11)   Hell yeah. Care for children in the early stages of life is important, yet you'll still get MRAs who bemoan paid leave, as it ""makes a worker less valuable.""  You see, THIS is what advocating for men's rights looks like. The document didn't seek to oust feminism in gender studies, it didn't piggyback on Red-Pill theory, and it didn't place blame on a ""new way"" that men are treated, but rather how society has viewed men as a whole, with historical context.  I'm saving this pdf, as it has shown that there are great advocacy groups out there centered at mens' experience that don't need to align themselves with the MRM. And best of all, it was provided by someone who tried to make MRAs look good, but has shown just how juvenile Paul Elam UnitedTM is, in comparison to those who have taken an active effort into improving the lives of those across the gender spectrum. This is why one can easily call themselves an advocate for men's rights without associating with the MRM. Simply by doing what's right without resorting to misogyny when the chance arises.

Contrary to MRA supposition, no hostility is shown and the organisation is completely willing to abide demands of male survivors. Original post.  2. Overwhelmingly positive reception by feminist groups and DV shelters toward opening male specific shelters, offering support for such initiatives.  MRAs never pursued this to fruition.  3.

Instead of directing homeless men to the many valuable resources and tips that ANY homeless person could benefit from, they'd rather bitch about how there is (questionably) ""more"" help for female homeless. Because female-specific homeless services exist that means somehow it's taking away from men? Like how teen shelters take away from adults...?? Nope.

But the theory holds, these women still want to have babies with the alphas, so they either cheat on their beta mates or spend years sleeping with alphas and then, as their looks begin to fade, quickly grab a beta to exploit financially before the woman becomes too old to be marriageable.

In a fully-realized communist society, workers wouldn't be commodities because labor wouldn't be something to be sold; it would be freely shared by those who do it to benefit their community and to fully actualize their life experiences. Workers would be free to pursue what fulfills them, and would be in control of their labor and their workplace. In other words, people wouldn't be forced to do one repetitive thing day in, day out, at the behest of and for the profit of someone else.

In October we put up life-sized silhouettes of local people, people, killed in domestic violence disputes with a brief description of what happened to them. Some silhouettes were guys and little boys but some guys still were butthurt. A few silhouettes were even vandalized. All the vandilized ones were women and one was a transwoman's. They drew a dick on the transwoman, one said most domestic violence is started by women, and the other said shoulda made him that sandwich. They were expensive too and we planned on using them for a couple years. We were able to paint over the dick but the other two were defaced over the printing so we had to get them redone.

But something folks ought to know:  Any emergency DV shelter receiving funding under VAWA (most of them, but not all--some church affiliated shelters, for example, are fully funded privately) has to essentially offer gender neutral services. That includes housing men with whatever accommodations they would house women. Our shelter just houses men on-site, same as we would house women. Others may offer off-site housing, but they have to offer the same services (generally, crisis intervention, case management, and whatever other programs are offered to other residents, like legal advocacy).  Crisis intervention services are not generally gendered, and our training standards, as determined by our state level org, demand that we do specifically discuss how to effectively help men (because there are definitely unique issues facing male survivors of DV/SA!).  If someone feels like a shelter might not be meeting its obligations, you can definitely contact the state level org (usually ""State Coalition Against Domestic Violence/Abuse"" or something like that) and mention it. Most federal grants are disbursed through those state-level orgs and for us, at least, the state-level org has definitely handed down mandates if there were concerns about program compliance with federal stipulations. State orgs live and breathe on federal grant money and they're not gonna let one shelter fuck it up. That's why they exist: to hold feet to the fire when it needs done."

Here Ally Fogg comes right out and acknowledges that parenting involves mandatory participation on the part of mom but purely discretionary participation from dad, and dads usually like it this way. It explains far better than any ridiculous childish conspiracy theory about how ""family courts are stacked against men and this is 100% ironclad fact"" why the number of dads with primary custody of their kids are so low.

They care about trying to do away with child support. That's what this is really about. It's why they insist financial abortion should be a right. They know goddam well that the number of guys who are going to actually be railroaded into lifelong financial servitude over a one-night-stand with a trickster - the scenario they invoke when trying to sell still more loopholes for men to weasel out of their responsibilities to their kids - is next to nil.

To even call it a right is strange, as it has always been a woman's (""natural"") duty. Considering all this, I'm not surprised at the lack of positive reactions. These rigid sex roles have always been to the benefit of men, otherwise they wouldn't be soo deply ingrained and regarded as ""healthy and natural"" like they are.  In Germany, fathers can have OR share ""parent time"" with the mother (up until the child is 3 years old), but very few fathers actually choose this, or, if they do, they only take a very short time off.

(Incidentally, the last guy this happened with, who got really depressed while we were hanging out in bed, leading to me saying something about how now I definitely just wanted to cuddle, also loses interest in having sex with me when I'm being particularly panicky or upset, and definitely wouldn't have sex with me if I was crying, so I really don't even see this as a gendered issue.)"

againstmensrights,32lkoa,jbinbin,0,Wed Apr 15 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"anyway to put it simply... if you're a woman, and a man tells you why he hides his emotion, you don't scoff at him and explain to him how he actually feels. that sounds an awful lot like ""mansplaining"" doesn't it? you don't tell a man who already knows why he hides his emotion that he's actually hiding it to avoid being shamed by other men. if he says it right to your face that he wants to avoid being shamed by women, you take him seriously. maybe not all men feel that way, but he does. he couldn't be so fundamentally wrong about his own god damn emotions. like i said in my earlier posts, MRAs are pretty sick of having women tell us how we feel. sick of having feminists tell us what we fantasize about. i don't make up feelings that women supposedly hold, and i certainly don't tell them why they feel a certain way. i don't tell women that they're only afraid of men because feminists brainwashed them. so for you to scoff at a man saying he hides his emotions to avoid shame from female, just because you're conditioned to view it as ""problematic,"" is not only stupid, it's hurtful.  you're a perfect example of people not listening to male emotions. like just look at yourself. in one breath you've listed as problematic ""the way we deal with male emotions,"" and completely discredited and ignored a man's emotions, arguing that he has HIS OWN FUCKING EMOTIONS completely backwards. i'm sorry but this is just ridiculous. how can you claim to be an expert on ""how we deal with male emotions"" when you completely discount male emotions? it's just the most insane hypocrisy. and this is why i'm not a feminist in the first place. there is so much blatant hypocrisy all over the place in feminism, it feels almost like a sinking ship. to be in favor of men showing their emotions, you have to stop mocking men when they show emotions you don't like. if you want to disagree with him, that's fine. it's totally cool to disagree with him. but to use this ad hominem that he's just sexually insecure is not helping the problem in any way. you can disagree with him and argue with him, but if you're going to shame him when he shares his emotions, you don't get to claim credit for ""fighting for men to be vulnerable."" if a man is vulnerable, and you strike him while he's down with the most shaming attacks that can be used against a heterosexual man, then you are fighting on the wrong side. you want men to be vulnerable, stop shaming their sexuality or their sexual success. it's that simple. MRAs are not manbabies, fedoras, or neckbeards. they are MRAs.  the second you stop calling them language that's intended to portray them as losers who can't get laid or don't have jobs, who are only MRAs because of their own sexual inadequacy, is the second i give you credit for fighting for men to be able to show their emotion. it's really the worst thing you could call a man. ""creepy"" or ""gross"" or a ""loser,"" these are all words that shame men more than any other word. there is nothing that makes a man feel more ashamed, more inadequate, than attacking his sexual insecurities. telling him that he is unable to attract females, please females, or provide for females, is just indefensible. it's cruel. that is no way to argue, and that is why so many people now support us and our movement over you and yours. if you want to work together to fight for male and female rights & interests, then first you are gonna have to stop shaming every man who disagrees with you."

I am mocked, and humiliated, and thrown under the bus. It's been a very strange thing to learn, but I now understand. The simple fact is that most people aren't thinking at a high enough level, with enough self-awareness, to realize that they themselves discriminate against the very people they tell to open up. It's psych 101; they see the individual as weak, as being held back by self as opposed to surroundings; they see themselves as being held back by surrounds, each unique. It's very, very simple. Feminists, at the end of the day, are not humanists, and are simply not on enough of ""the level,"" if you will, to actually discuss what is, what can be, and what was. Very few people are, but very few people push things on others in such a hypocritical fashion.

Instead, they think ADHD is actually an excuse created by feminism to treat normally developing young boys like there's something wrong with them and force them to take medications that essentially feminize their behaviour.

By contrast, female sexual objectification is an ongoing socioeconomic-cum-psychosexual epidemic, affecting the vast majority of women at some stages of their lives. Even when they are no longer objectified (losing looks or fertility; ageing), it’s used against them in a routine way. Without meaning to be crude, from a female perspective, you’re screwed when you’re being sexually objectified, then you’re screwed when you’re not.

Sexual Contact is:  *Any intentional sexual touching  *However slight  *With any object or body part (as described below)  *Performed by a person upon another person  Sexual Contact includes (a) intentional touching of the breasts, buttocks, groin or genitals, whether clothed or unclothed, or intentionally touching another with any of these body parts; and (b) making another touch you or themselves with or on any of these body parts.  (2) Sexual Intercourse is:  *Any penetration  *However slight  *With any object or body part (as described below)  *Performed by a person upon another person  Sexual Intercourse includes (a) vaginal penetration by a penis, object, tongue, or finger; (b) anal penetration by a penis, object, tongue, or finger; and (c) any contact, no matter how slight, between the mouth of one person and the genitalia of another person.  (3) Affirmative Consent is:  *Informed (knowing)  *Voluntary (freely given)  *Active (not passive), meaning that, through the demonstration of clear words or actions, a person has indicated permission to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity    The Liberty Unyielding truth twistarama.   If you hug your boyfriend and as a result your clothed body (including your breasts) touches him, you could be accused of “sexual assault” through “sexual contact” under the University of Virginia’s broad new “sexual assault” policy adopted to appease the Office for Civil Rights, where I used to work (assuming you do it without explicitly agreeing on the details of the hug). Because U.Va. lumps together touching, “however slight,” and intercourse when it comes to sexual assault, requiring “affirmative” consent for both.    That's ridiculous of course, if you hug someone you're in any sort of relationship with, including friends, and have previously hugged, if they're receptive and the hug you back then there is zero chance it could be confused with sexual assault. Even if one or more of the people hugging happen to have breasts.  So the fear mongering in the example in the opener is pure bullshit. Shocking, I know.   (“Affirmative consent” is a misleading term, and does not include many forms of consent that occur in the real world, and are recognized by the courts, as I explain at this link. The new policy further warns that “Relying solely on non-verbal  communication before or during sexual activity can lead to misunderstanding and may result in a violation of this Policy.” Portions of U.Va.’s policy are reprinted below.).   If I were a cynic, I'd think this paragraph is deliberate attempt to misrepresent how UVA's policy defines ""affirmative consent"" and falsely portraying it as demanding verbal consent for every action instead of stating that ""clear words or actions... indicate permission"".   Moreover, making out is now effectively forbidden at the University of Virginia, which >has rewritten its Interim Sexual Assault Policy under the impetus of the Education Department’s Title IX investigation. U.Va.’s new policy requires “affirmative consent” (rather than “effective consent,” as before) not just to sex, but also sexual contact, which encompasses touching.  Of course, no one ever says things like “may I touch your breast” before doing so.  These things are welcomed after they begin, not authorized in advance, but the policy effectively forbids step-by-step ratification after the fact (i.e., making out) by banning any touching “however slight” without such authorization, so if you touch your partner an instant before they welcome it, you’ve presumably violated the policy.    Except if both partners are making out then their mutual continued participation can show consent through their actions.  Also, I eagerly await a mister post about how this policy effects male rape victims. Yeah, /s, sadly."
againstmensrights,328wmy,LylahClare,7,Sat Apr 11 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that UVA recommending people don't rely solely on non-verbal consent is simply very good advice, despite Liberty Unyielding's outrage over it.  If one parter trys to forcefully initiate sexual intercourse during a make out without verbal consent, especially if they aren't sexual partners, it can lead to more than ""misunderstandings"". The language of the UVA policy is, if anything, deliberately careful.  I know the author thinks ""may I touch your breast"" sounds completely ridiculous, even though there are people, especially unexperienced teens, who want to take it slow."
againstmensrights,328wmy,LylahClare,3,Sat Apr 11 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"It's not even a matter of wanting to take it slow or inexperience.

Especially after college where there were a lot of dodged kisses (I hated the resulting slobber trail) and ass grabbing and other unwanted contact, it's just a relief that seems to be over for the most part.  But the fact these guys can't wrap their mind around asking permission is sad."

What MRAs are really objecting to here is the principle that they need consent before sexual contact with someone.  Edit: Worth pointing out that clearly a hug can be sexual in nature, but these MRAs seem to be assuming that all hugs count as sexual contact, which I'm not convinced by."

Someone thought it was so important to note that women are more likely to suffer from ""mental disorders"" than men, even though that's only anxiety and depression (no difference with other diagnoses such as schizophrenia)...But another poster points out that women have unbelievably high self-confidence ""these days"". HMM. Also, if you want to link a study that supposedly takes shots at one gender, you might not want to choose one that says men externalize the same problems instead of internalizing it, making them more likely to affect others with their negative behavior.  Looking at the other comments shows more gold. ""Women are more likely to text/call when driving"". Let's throw irrelevant shit in here just in case we don't get our point across that women r bad. But men are far more likely to get into accidents, and on top of that, men's accidents tend to be more serious. Men are more likely to get distracted with the radio and get into an accident.

It's seeming pretty crap one, IMHO, but these STEMlords are all over it because it focuses on male narcissistism.   My suspicion: It's a phenomenon that has loing been suspected ( to be honest, I think I have never looked at a selfie and not thought ""What a sick morally bankrupt, socially degenrate and twisted individual""), but due to the usual onesidedness in finding bad things, it's only ""discovered"" in men.  The article leaves out how selfies is much more of a female behavior and how for a large group of women especially in America, their who life is about manipulation and presentation of their image to control men. But if a guy takes a selfie he must be a psycho.  It bleeds into the differences with body positivity between genders in general. Women are constantly told they're beautiful from a young age, but men stop getting that once they reach adolescence. Consequently, women are more likely to celebrate their beauty then me.   The last one's attempt describe how the cultural dynamics of female beauty work fails so spectacularly that it's almost impressive in it's wrongness."

I'm seriously fucking tired of this straw man argument. No rights movement has ever prioritized other groups' problems.   If they want to seriously address men's issues then they need to stop lashing out against another rights movement and try to explore the root of these problems. If your problems aren't getting enough attention you need to try to pinpoint where they came from and create a logical explanation for how, and how it can best be fixed.  The ""men's rights"" movement lacks any kind of clear goal to end these problems other than eliminating feminism, which I guarantee did not cause a bunch of issues in men's relationships with each other and with themselves.  It's hilarious that when feminism does go out on a limb to try to take care of issues that are mostly irrelevant to the movement, they are criticized for not doing enough.  In a country that has been run by men for a couple hundred years which grew from another culture run by men, women had no power to fuck shit up for them. The problems ""men's rights"" people bemoan have existed since pre-feminism days. Maybe running society with that much of an imbalance screwed over a lot of people of both genders. HMMM...

Anything else is simply deflected. Feminist theory has created a number of mental templates that preclude them from having a reasoned discussion about men's issues. They start from a standpoint of male patriarchal oppression, then make everything they find fit that narrative. When more men die in war, it just means that women are victims from losing the men in their life. When men die on the job, it's an example of businesses not trusting women with dangerous tasks. When men are vastly more likely to be murdered by strangers, they use that to talk about how much more likely women are to be killed by someone they know. Take a Father's kids away and it's evidence of forcing women into child care roles. Yet fighting for shared parenting is supposedly abusive behavior. etc.. etc... Men's issues inside of Feminism can't be seriously discussed with all of this baggage. Treating all problems as if they have one answer is unproductive. Take a hard look at your thought process if you ever find yourself thinking that all problems stem from one group of people or can be solved by one type of action."

againstmensrights,3247gd,anisaerah,7,Fri Apr 10 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is a men's rights issue, because men should have 50% equal access and physical and legal custody of their children without child support wealth redistribution that is rationalized by unequal custody orders - by default of law unless one parent is proven to be a clear and present danger to their children- without needing to pay tens-to-hundreds of thousands of dollars just for the privilege of seeing their children that men must pay if the mother refuses to let their Fathers see their children.   I wish these guys actually understood how things actually work.  Child support is not a payment to see your child. Support and custody are separate issues (other than parenting time used in calculating support), and most men who contest custody win.  It's sad and ironic that they call for 50/50 custody to be mandated into law, when the vast majority of custody cases are agreed by the parties involved, and a court doesn't decide who gets custody.  I think we need societal change where men do half of the parenting as a normal thing before we mandate that sort of thing. Something like 25% of noncustodial fathers see their children once a year or less. I don't think it would be fair to their kids to assume they are doing half of the parenting, and not obligate them to pay support."

Personally, I think the only way to solve the problem of low income noncustodial parents having genuine difficulty making child support payments is to have a basic income for children (at the very least).   While I agree that seeing legal custody as a ""ownership of children"" is not a good attitude to have, children do need to have guardians who are obligated to care for them, because they can't care for themselves. We don't have much of a social support system in the US, so the default is biological parents (because we can determine that biologically and defacto) unless they cannot and someone else steps up.  Without having a court system to enforce agreements about child custody, how can we protect the rights of children?"
againstmensrights,3247gd,anisaerah,3,Fri Apr 10 23:22:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I forgot to say what I mean haha. I think we need to look more to the other people around children and not put so much stock into the institution of ""parent."" like, kids already spend much of their time growing up in school. We should also look to their peers and push for more autonomy for children in general. I think having one or two parents as the supreme arbiters of their children's fates leaves far too much room for abuse. But yeah, it's not something that can simply be mandated.   And I do agree that a basic income would be a far better bandaid than what we have now."

Dudes who yell at you from their cars and disappear but then corner you in the next streets, or dudes at the supermarket checking out your ass and throwing random ""wow"" or whistling = not good first impression of these men.   The thing I say to guys who pretend there's no problem with cat-calling or women are just paranoid: if it's something you wouldn't want be done to your daughter/sister/mother and it's something you consider some women ""asked for"", then you know it's offensive and you're lying for your own anti-feminist agenda. It's a very cliché catchphrase but it shows what they think of cat-calling and the women receiving it. As for women who see no problem, then good for them.  My friend's father is your typical blue-collar middle-aged divorced dad, the type to say ""shut the fuck up"" at his TV and change channel whenever something mildly feminist or anti-racist appear on the news... He still beat the crap out of his neighbour just for having stared at his daughter's body. Also one day, while we were walking on a big road, a pizza delivery boy passed by and told us ""hi"" from his scooter: it looked like your typical cat-call but he was actually an old high school classmate saying hi. My friend's dad got furious and gave no fuck about the fact he was our friend, he just ""lacked respect"", so in the evening, he ordered a pizza from the place the boy worked at and said he wanted this particular delivery boy: all I'll say is that now this boy will probably never cat-call any woman.

And then it presents an exaggerated version of the MGTOW philosophy, which is satirising... how feminists strawman MGTOWS I guess?  And then it does a brief review of some butter? What?

""Vaginterrupting"" (HOLY FUCK I'VE GOT TO SAY IT AGAIN THAT IS SO GODDAM STUPID) won't work because women going around randomly interrupting mens' ""deep thoughts"" with prosaic questions isn't a readily identifiable social phenomenon. All it actually does is manage to make the person who devised this word look more like a (wait for it) mansplainer. He's talking down to women, trivializing and invalidating basically anything they might have to say by classifying all of it as a potential ""interruption"" of his genius thoughts.

Second,  a guy that big would be retrieved by TWO soldiers.  Or dragged.  Back injuries need to be avoided,  and you can get disciplined for not acting safely.  Third,  the ""sensitive items"" are actually pretty light and not that big a deal if the choice is somebody's life or somebody's rifle.  Just about anything else,  if it's too much,  can and WILL BE destroyed on the spot.    These morons act like being huge is the only way to be a soldier. It's not.

Wikipedia has a great quote on the subject from arch-suffragette Emily Pankhurst:   …if you really want to get anything done, it is not so much a matter of whether you alienate sympathy; sympathy is a very unsatisfactory thing if it is not practical sympathy. It does not matter to the practical suffragist whether she alienates sympathy that was never of any use to her. What she wants is to get something practical done, and whether it is done out of sympathy or whether it is done out of fear…doesn't particularly matter so long as you get it. We had enough of sympathy for fifty years; it never brought us anything, and we would rather have an angry man going to the government and saying, my business is interfered with and I won't submit to its being interfered with any longer because you won't give women the vote, than to have a gentleman come onto our platforms year in and year out and talk about his ardent sympathy with woman’s suffrage.   There's a long history of effective direct action in feminism, and it's more than a little problematic that you, a male feminist ally, presume to tell me and the other women here how best to effect our own liberation. Instead you should respect that feminism is a diverse movement with diverse tactics and choose solidarity over chastisement.   I respect you a lot, and it makes me sad to see you say this kind of stuff. But's it's an important conversation and I hope we can continue it."

Evaluators penalized female candidates more than male candidates for initiating negotiations. In Experiment 3, participants evaluated videotapes of candidates who accepted compensation offers or initiated negotiations. Male evaluators penalized female candidates more than male candidates for initiating negotiations; female evaluators penalized all candidates for initiating negotiations. Perceptions of niceness and demandingness explained resistance to female negotiators. In Experiment 4, participants adopted the candidate’s perspective and assessed whether to initiate negotiations in same scenario used in Experiment 3. With male evaluators, women were less inclined than men to negotiate, and nervousness explained this effect. There was no gender difference when evaluator was female."

He never point blank asks her out so she can reject him -- probably because he knows his attentions are unwanted. His behavior has been telegraphing the idea that he doesn't take no for an answer. For instance, the last time he was there I informed him Laurie was out, he just walked around me straight into her office. Aggressive shit like that.  The guy is a certified creeper, the woman, Laurie, is afraid to offend him because he is her father's best friend (ewwwww) and a customer.   Had a week-long exchange with a Redditor who actually argued that repeated, aggressive, and unwanted sexual attention should not be objected to as long as the guy is ""just talking to her"" socially. He actually argued that because he had not asked her out, there was no way of knowing there was sexual interest, so therefore, she had no right to label it as ""unwanted sexual attention"" and should just put up with this shit.  To save some of the hassle of reading through a blizzard of posts, I'll post the best gems here:   And we're still making some ludicrous claim that merely making conversations means a guy is trying to get into a girl's panties. YOu know maybe, just maybe it is perfectly innocent, maybe you should fit that possibility into your over inflated view of yourselves.  Yes she has made some overtly subtle indications that shes not interested romantically but he's only making conversation regardless of his assumed end goal.  Assuming it's acceptable to interact with a fellow human being doesn't strike me as negative at all, if other people talking to you about not remotely sexual things makes you afraid, it's your problem, and if you then proceed to make no indication this is the case how can you expect the guy to know that. the unreasonable expectation here is on her side.  I fail to see how you hope to convince me that talking in a respectful way to a woman is harmful to anyone ever?  in fact, you wanna talk harmful, think of the end result of telling men they need to be extra careful with what they say to women  Most women don't mind polite, respectful conversation, it's only the sexist ones like you that think every man that has the nerve to talk to them is trying to get them into bed.  It's sexist to assume someone talking to you has any sexual intentions at all based on their gender.  It's just plain stupid to expect people to pick up, from oversubtle hints that you are not romantically interested, that you are also uncomfortable even talking to said people.  men don't exist to make you feel comfortable and safe, nor do they need to be hypersensitive to their intentions being misinterpreted, or somehow be aware of feelings you fail to communicate like a normal human being.

To rage over the rare male victim being ordered support and ignore the thousands of underage mothers who, while not formally ordered support, are raising their children? To act like it's uncommon for even forcibly raped women to go through pregnancy, who go on to give birth and raise their babies...alone? Then consider marital rape was not even outlawed until the 90's in the US. I mean, the sheer number of women raising/or have raised children resulting from rape is enormous. Just because they were not necissarily brought to court means their contribution is meaningless, they don't count? They are also not immune to the state coming after them if their child ends up in foster care. Rape is not a defense in that instance. If they gave birth then they are responsible...and unlike the father, the mothers are always identified and known. MRA's might like to say the mother could abort and avoid any responsibility but it's not that easy...she may not be able to afford it...or in extreme circumstances, may be prevented from doing so by an abusive partner, a captor (as in cases like Jaycee Dugard or Amanda Berry and others like them), being incarcerated and not being afforded the option to abort due to the circumstances....or not knowing in time, etc. Mothers are absolutely, positively more affected by children resulting from rape than fathers.

againstmensrights,31fc1d,theone899,24,Sat Apr 4 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Islamophobia is intimately linked to racism - people don't just worry about the spread of Islam, they fear immigration from Islamic countries (which, gasp, just happen to be non-white, I don't hear much fearmongering about Albanian Muslims) and being ""outbred"".  Secondly, you're fundamentally misrepresenting that incident. As the Guardian pointed out, the Rochdale crisis was indeed ignored by officials, but is this really because officials were scared of being called racist? Because it seems to me like it more clearly fits into a narrative where no sexual abuse by any perpetrators was being reported properly, see Saville, see the number of celebrities only now being brought to justice, see the investigation into the MP pedophile ring."

It never will be. Especially if this ideology encourages misogyny. There are ex-Muslims who are people of colour and they hate Islam.   I'm not referring to the Rochdale incident, I'm referring to the Rotherham scandal. I live quite near to it and the community felt let-down.   They (Police) were afraid of being called racist because those men were of colour. The rape was reported numerous times by the rape victims themselves and it was discarded. There are far too many red-flags in the reports because they had multiple chances to arrest the rapists but did not. These men weren't celebrities like Saville either, they had grooming gangs around the country.  There was recently a documentary called Things We Won't Say About Race Which Are True which was presented by Trevor Phillips,  former head of the Commission for Racial Equality (he's black).

It should have been stopped and prevented Isabel, Abuse victim Failures by those charged with protecting children happened despite three reports between 2002 and 2006 which both the council and police were aware of, and ""which could not have been clearer in the description of the situation in Rotherham"". Prof Jay said the first of these reports was ""effectively suppressed"" because senior officers did not believe the data. The other two were ignored, she said. The inquiry team found that in the early-2000s when a group of professionals attempted to monitor a number of children believed to be at risk, ""managers gave little help or support to their efforts"". The report revealed some people at a senior level in the police and children's social care thought the extent of the problem was being ""exaggerated"". Prof Jay said: ""The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for."" A victim of abuse in Rotherham, who has been called ""Isabel"" to protect her identity, told BBC Panorama: ""I was a child and they should have stepped in. ""No matter what's done now... it's not going to change that it was too late, it should have been stopped and prevented."" line Analysis James Vincent, BBC Look North The scale of this report is simply staggering and some of the detail extremely hard to read. It lays out how Rotherham Council and the police knew about the level of child sexual exploitation in the town, but didn't do anything about it. They either didn't believe what they were being told, played it down, or were too nervous to act. The failures, the report says, are blatant. The report estimates 1,400 children were sexually exploited over 16 years, with one young person telling the report's author that gang rape was a usual part of growing up in Rotherham. The processes for dealing with these crimes have got better in the last four years, but still improvements need to be made. There were more apologies from the council today but the report's author says they are too late. line Speaking about her abuser, Isabel said: ""I think because the police were aware and social services were aware and he knew that and they still didn't stop him it I think it encouraged him. ""It almost became like a game to him. He was untouchable."" The council and its partners could and should have done more to protect young people Martin Kimber, Rotherham Borough Council Speaking after the publication of the report, Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove said: ""I'm appalled by the extent of the horrific abuse endured by these vulnerable victims. ""It's deeply distressing how the authorities failed to protect these young people and their voices were not heard. ""Everyone involved needs to take responsibility for the shocking failings that this report has exposed. This must not happen again. ""I want to see every one of these victims getting the right support now and for as long as it takes them to help them on the path to recovery."" Maggie Atkinson, children's commissioner for England, said the number of identified child victims was ""largely consistent"" with the findings of their own national inquiry into ""child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups""."

againstmensrights,31fc1d,Angadar,-3,Sun Apr 5 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"Edit: As I said before, I am not white. I am brown. Liking a black Feminist who opposes Islam is not white supremacy. Islam is an ideology and NOT a race; opposing it is not racist. If it makes you feel any better, I also oppose Sikhism being an ex-Sikh.  This essentially is my problem with some modern Feminists. It needs to actively acknowledge the source of what causes oppression in these Islamic countries and stop being so afraid of offending people. Using terms like ''Islamophobic'' undermines the Feminist goal of achieving gender-equality, it stifles any real discussion, even from ex-Muslims who have experienced such oppression.  This is why Ayaan Hirsi Ali is taken seriously by academics and scholars. She is acknowledging a barrier to equality. She has insight and intimate experience in addition to being well-versed. People getting offended by criticism of religion should be more offended by what is done in the name of their religion, if it's oh-so-peaceful.  I find The Qu'ran offensive for the misogyny it encourages.  Allow me to post a list of laws women face in Saudi Arabia, home to the barbaric, murderous and misogynistic conquering war-lord that was the ''prophet'' Muhammad.  http://www.theweek.co.uk/middle-east/60339/eleven-things-women-in-saudi-arabia-cant-do#ixzz3WMdSgPNH   Go anywhere without a male chaperone  When leaving the house, Saudi women need to be accompanied by a 'mahram' who is usually a male relative. Such practices are rooted in ""conservative traditions and religious views that hold giving freedom of movement to women would make them vulnerable to sins,"" according to The Guardian. In one extreme case, a teenager reported that she had been gang-raped, but because she was not with a mahram when it occurred, she was punished by the court. The victim, known as ""the Girl of Qatif' was given more lashes than one of her alleged rapists received, the Washington Post reports.  Drive a car  There is no official law that bans women from driving but deeply held religious beliefs prohibit it, with Saudi clerics arguing that female drivers ""undermine social values"". In 2011 a group of Saudi women organised the ""Women2Drive"" campaign which encouraged women to disregard the laws and post images and videos of themselves driving on social media to raise awareness of the issue in an attempt to force change. It was not a major success. Saudi journalist Talal Alharbi says women should be allowed to drive – but only to take their children to school or a family member to hospital. ""Women should accept simple things"", he writes for Arab News. ""This is a wise thing women could do at this stage. Being stubborn won't support their cause.""  Vote in elections  Saudi Arabia is the only other country in the world, apart from the Vatican City where women are not allowed to vote, but men are, the Washington Post reports. However, a royal decree will allow women to vote in local elections in 2015.  Go for a swim  Reuters correspondent Arlene Getz describes her experience of trying to use the gym and pool at an upmarket Riyadh hotel: ""As a woman, I wasn't even allowed to look at them ('there are men in swimsuits there,' a hotel staffer told me with horror) — let alone use them.""  Compete freely in sports  Last month, Saudi Arabia proposed hosting an Olympic Games without women. ""Our society can be very conservative,"" said Prince Fahad bin Jalawi al-Saud, a consultant to the Saudi Olympic Committee. ""It has a hard time accepting that women can compete in sports."" When Saudi Arabia sent its female athletes to the London games for the first time, hard-line clerics denounced the women as ""prostitutes"". While they were allowed to compete, they had to be accompanied by a male guardian and wear a ""Sharia-compliant"" sports kit that covered their hair.  Try on clothes when shopping  ""The mere thought of a disrobed woman behind a dressing-room door is apparently too much for men to handle,"" says Vanity Fair writer Maureen Dowd in 'A Girl's Guide to Saudi Arabia'.

Many, many countries fail to protect the victims of rape, but some go a step further -- punishing women for leaving the house without a male companion, for being alone with an unrelated man, or for getting pregnant afterwards. The most infamous case may be Saudi Arabia’s “Qatif girl,” but a recent suicide in Morocco also made headlines -- 16-year-old Amina Filali killed herself after a judge forced her to marry her alleged rapist, in keeping with a policy that invalidates statutory rape charges if the parties marry."

Article 209 of Iran’s Constitution states that woman's life is valued only half as much as a man's life. A convicted man who has intentionally slain a woman is subject to execution only after the payment of ""Deyeh"" by the family of the victim. ""Deyeh"" is defined as a sum of money that the victim's family has to pay to the assailant's family for the physical damages, dismemberment, or death of the assailant.  Article 300 of the Penal code states that the ""Deyeh"" of a Muslim woman is half of the ""Deyeh"" of a Muslim man. By law the life of a woman has half the value of a man in Islamic criminal law in Iran.  In 1998, Iran’s Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the bill on same inheritance rights for man and women. They said the proposal was contrary to Islamic law, which stipulates that a woman’s share may only be one half that of a man’s.   Article 102 of Iran’s Constitution indicates: ""Women who appear on streets and in public without the prescribed ‘Islamic Hejab’ will be condemned to 74 strokes of the lash.”2  Iran’s Parliament adopted a law, in April of 1998, to fully segregate the health care system for women and girls. This law has seriously compromised women’s health because there are not enough trained female physicians and health care professionals to meet the needs of all the women and girls in Iran. The same law also points to another new law of prohibiting the discussion of women’s issues or rights outside the interpretation of Shari’a (Islamic law). *Women’s rights can only be discussed by religious male figures in Iran. *"

Example: I had an argument with some gamers on a forum after someone posted an article about prison rape: we argued which sex has it worse in a situation of rape... I hate how this guy felt the need to ask this but I said it's horrible for anyone and rapists are always sick fucks; a girl said it's worse for women because they can't defend themselves or get revenge and people can call them names; one guy said it's worse for straight men only and the other guys were just like ""you're girls, you can't understand how it feels for men, it will ruin a man's life, trust me it's much worse for us"".

I don't know if the OP here has specific examples of how men have it worse and I don't want to read the whole thread but apart from war, I think he's wrong that men have it ""often worse"".

Absolutely. Go to any long-term ward in a hospital and see which gender the majority of the people by the bedsides are. I've volunteered in a handful of hospitals and I've seen many, many wives taking care of their crippled, disturbed or dying husbands. And many, many women being taken care of by sisters or other female relatives because hubby ran for the hills when thinks turned ugly.  I really think it's a learned behaviour as women are expected to be caretakers (be it children, the elderly or the ailing) and thus leaving your sick husband is a kind of social suicide for a female, whereas a man is more or less expected to ""not be able to cope"" and has an easier way out.  Regarding your example about rape, I think it has to do with homophobia and the fact that penetrative sex is part of being a straight woman but a straight man who is raped is having an experience that he isn't supposed to go through ever in his life  so there's an ""unusual"" side to it that kind of adds to the trauma.   IMO it's the other way around, I think it's far more traumatic to have an experience that's supposed to be a moment of pleasure and intimacy associated with pain and suffering. Not that the experience itself is worse (I don't think we can or should compare anyway), but the path to recovery. A bit like being in a car crash versus being attacked by a bear while hiking: you can just never go in the woods again if it's triggering but you can't isolate yourself from traffic."

The court decides whether you're going to jail, not what the objective facts of history are. There's no meaningful distinction between ""not guilty"" and ""not enough evidence,"" because guilt in a legal context is nothing but a statement about evidence.

Innocence is a statement of fact, but guilt is (in the law) a statement of what can be proved.  It is confusing, though, even for native English speakers. Normally ""guilt"" is the opposite of ""innocence,"" but in the law they have special, more specific meanings."

I am not a lawyer, but as I understand it this is not true. An acquittal just means that you were not found guilty of the charge.

Because this Taliban-like vigilante justice will help everyone in the situation, and these values totally aren't what our justice system was built to prevent.

On another level, it shows how thin the veil can be that MRA's claim they genuinely care about men's rights and promoting gender equality/egalitarianism. If a man is falsely accused of rape and is acquitted, how can someone possibly believe, with the man's best interest in mind, encouraging him to revenge-rape the girl does both parties justice and is going to help him psychologically and emotionally heal and move on? Please, tell me how women react emotionally and men use reason. The contradictions are astounding.  Of course this was maybe one or two individuals among plenty of others who this awful thought never crossed their minds, but I think none of us are strangers here to seeing MRAs promote and threaten women with rape for expressing opinions they disagree with, or as a response to challenging male privilege."

I'd advise saying no to all these last three; as long as you can travel sometimes then it's not unreasonable to also be unavailable for travel other times if it's not a normal part of the job.  It's actually a lot harder to answer these types of questions once you do have kids, because it's easy to say you don't have any plans to start a family without precluding having children later. It probably wouldn't even raise eyebrows unless it was soon after being hired.  It's worth noting while some questions are illegal, it's not illegal to ask a neutral question like """"Where do you see yourself in five years?"" to see if any information is volunteered by the candidate, e.g. mentioning family or needing flexibility, as long as the question is asked to all candidates and not just women.  I wouldn't say the coded questions are difficult to spot; the tricky part is not giving an answer without coming off too confrontational. You can ask how it relates to the job, or point out that it's illegal, but the best route imho is to simply say you're dedicated to performing well at your job and then ask a follow-up question about something else."

Comparing the two candidates solely on their skills, abilities, dispositions, competencies and qualities is equality. On the other hand, in a society which is striving to reduce the pay gap, the woman may get the better job. In turn, the pay gap will be lowered, and many will think equality is being achieved. It isn’t. I’m sure the woman wouldn’t want the job if her gender was the only thing that merited her it.

He's setting up a scenario comparing two jobs with different pays in the same company; clearly they're going to have different functions and requirements to justify the pay. I don't think I need to clarify to anyone on here that the pay gap comes from comparing women and men's salaries FOR DOING THE SAME JOB.  What a fucking joke. This article is promoting hysteria and slippery-slope fallacies. To begin with, the suspicion that women are getting jobs over a man ""because she's a woman, but the man was more qualified"" is inherently sexist and flawed. I also find it troubling that these kind of arguments make such assumptions about employers, that they will pander to gender politics at the sacrifice of the productivity, success and profits of their company (big news: they won't), and ultimately make decisions independent of their own judgment (assuming the ""less qualified"" woman was hired over the ""more qualified"" man because of politics). In other words, ""we all know menz are always more capable and qualified for jobs, but we are just allowing womynz to join because we only care about gender politics, not because they actually have legitimate skill and knowledge and ethically should be paid as much as their male coworkers."" (Amirite?) Let's just doubt that employers have any sort of agency and sensible judgment in hiring workers, but assume they will inevitably only hire woman for better paying jobs and leave out poor hard-working menz because the media and pundits say they should fix the gender pay gap. These kind of arguments make no sense.   His research suggested that there are twenty-five key workplace decisions that men make which, in turn, allow them to earn more on average. Things like, for example:     working longer hours,     taking riskier or more hazardous jobs, and     willingness to train for more technical jobs which will limit their human contact.  And there you have it: men don’t earn more because of their gender.   Well shit. Problem solved! We should have just come to you for the answer! Everyone go home. Feminists=wrecked. Clearly this man perfectly understands culture and socialization from every perspective and individual reality which might result in this discrepancy between male and female work habits/preferences (and time affordance!).  Sure, these findings were based on a study that probably has legitimacy from an objective, measurable standpoint, but what I'm finding more and more is that MRA's have no concept of outcomes that result from atmospheric influences and our culture's zeitgeist. It's always black and white, cause and effect. No one wants to examine the bigger picture, question why these things happen. It's because they don't have to question the status quo. It already works in their favor. These issues don't negatively affect them, aside from teh terrible feminazis coming to take their jobs and freedoms.

Of course there's also the whole war thing. Men are the ones sent to die in battle. Of course it was men who were sending them out do die, but obviously they were slaves of the Matriarchy.

The mentally ill are stigmatized and kept from certain jobs and positions in life. And yet, tons of people lie and say they are healthy when on the brink. Men especially. Men are literally dying for that shit. They are choosing suicide over the stigma of being labeled mentally ill.   Being a victim of child sexual abuse does not carry as huge a stigma, but if it did, MORE people would lie about it. They'd just lie and pretend it never happened. What's worse?

For some reason, I have a hunch that the odds of a feminist claiming to have been ""raped"" are a factor above the population average.   I actually wouldn't be surprised if this were true, but obviously for different reasons. It's not hard to believe that rape victims would become feminists as a result of their traumatic experience. I know I didn't identify as one until my (now ex-) husband raped me. It was my experience with how other people treated me when I told them that made me realize our culture has a serious problem here.   My ex truly didn't believe he had done anything wrong. And many of the people I trusted made all kinds of excuses rather than just believe me and comfort me. People I thought I could trust were so quick to brush it off (""he's your husband, you should have just let him anyway, why would you say no?""), blame me (""what did you say to make him so mad? were you having sex with him often enough?""), or outright call me crazy/a liar (""he would never do that"" ""you must have misremembered it"" ""you're just trying to turn people against him""), even though I wasn't confessing it for any gain.

Which is understandable I guess, they shouldn't believe me just because I was crying when I finally told them. It had been more than a week by then.  So I lost my friends because I was raped.

Because MRAs know female population as a whole obviously... And the average female has no problem talking about it with these guys either... smh.

againstmensrights,30sywi,failuer101,12,Mon Mar 30 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"Ok here we go. From a psychoanalytical perspective we can most likey classify them as sensualists. Sensualism is the basis of TRP ideology and generally speaking the more masculine approach according to our culture. Now considering the weight of virginity and and our cultural standard of validation by sex, we could view the woman as the transference object used by the man. While women being viewed as ""pure"" or whatever become the perfect object for a man to transfer his sins i.e. insecurity, fear, and guilt. The more the woman is idolized as a spiritual figure (pure and innocent) the more significant this becomes. This idolization of women more pronounced when we add modern sexual trends such bdsm and the general demeaning of the woman through sex. this allows one to overcome the spiritual concept one has built up and thus become greater as oneself. These are all tools to validate the body as a defense against the fear of death; by spiritualizing women (calling the angels and covering them in make up in order to hide any flaws, flaws show mortality so a flawless object is immortal) one gains the opportunity to enhance oneself by overcoming or demeaning and destroying that concept.  This process of validation through idolization and then destruction can force the man to seek validation with or without consent as the spiritualized object having sex done to it in anyway would be considered demeaning and therefore validating for the prepetrator.  This whole process is reinforced by the conflicting ideologies of the MRM of viewing women as superior (feminist conspiracies, spermjacking, sexual manipulation) and the need to show the world, but particularly themselves, of the demeaned and destroyed concepts that our society idealizes. Thus the superior female image becomes a the object of hatred by preventing the the removal of  the veil of spiritualization necessary of body validation. This makes the idol destruction a moral imperative.  Sorry for the weird language I used when talking about women. I'm reading the denial of death by Earnest Becker and he uses this kind of language in his book.  TL;DR The process of rape culture. I think.

Then you have a required demand to fill on a small supply, which would push salaries up.  Physical exertion is such a tiny part of a nurse's job. There's so much pressure in hospitals to work together or use tools instead of someone using a good portion of their strength (especially at the capacity that a woman's wouldn't suffice).

Nursing is very often brought up, along with teaching and childcare. This is a very good example of a majority-female profession treating its men better than its women. Anything that demonstrates how full of shit MRA talking points are is absolutely relevant to this sub.  Also, this is not your sub. You do not mod it, you do not frequent it, and given your posting history, I'd be shocked if you've ever even visited it before, except to mock it. The mods determine the purpose of this subreddit, you do not. If they don't think it belongs here, they'll remove it. They don't need your help or input."

It's becoming more and more apparent that you people don't care about anything at all except for feeding your growing hostility.   I could be like you and fling a hate filled comment right back, without any concern for expanding a perspective, but I guess I still care a little too much.

That's not rude? But me getting fed up with his rudeness is?   Here's a little secret: you are not the first person to ever try and tone-police a feminist into silence because a man acted like an ass to her and she responded as an equal and not a servant. I'll never threaten a misogynist. I'll never wish him harm or celebrate when bad things happen to him. I'll never call him a slur. I'll never act like what is the norm for them. But I will not babysit him. Someone who is a blatant anti-feminist (and hasn't said something horribly bigoted) gets one shot, as far as I'm concerned. One attempt at me explaining my position, or trying to clear up some misconception. After that? Fuck him. I don't owe him my time or patience, and it's not like I'm going to get anything out of it.  You can beat down some feminists with tone-policing. I am not one of them. So you might as well stop wasting your time."

This is such a stupid fucking statement that I'm actually embarrassed for you.  Male dominated professions are often so because of a long history of oppressing women and not allowing them to advance in the workplace, or allowing them in at all.  Female dominated professions do NOT have a history of actively excluding men en masse. They are generally the result of women being told ""this is where women belong"", women finding less resistance in professions that men find to be ""women's work"", and men choosing not to go into those industries because ""women's work"" is bad or ""emasculating."" They are both the result of misogyny and patriarchy."

But yeah, there are less men in primary school teaching, because all the men are in administration and secondary school because it pays more. I would love to see this change but using bullshit scare tactics about how children are gonna say you raped them isn't going to encourage more men to take the pay cut.

But of course teaching is a ridiculously low paying job for the hours and energy it requires, it's major advantage is family friendly flexibility being more normal than elsewhere making it appealing to people who are primary childcarers, and it's stereotyped as an easy womens job by people, often men, who would leave crying within an hour if they actually had to deal with it. I'm sure none of those things account for the low numbers of male classroom teachers though right misters? Somehow it has to be women's fault.  And as an aside they can fuck off with their male teachers being singled out and treated like sex offenders crap.

Yes the man was entitled to her body, and the woman was entitled to the mans emotional and financial support. That was how marriage used to work.     Ah, the good old days."

What . . . so hyper-competition is only bad when women do it? WTabsoluteF? Also love how rape awareness is a ""weapon against men"". This is so far out there that it has reached Poe levels. And this is just the first fucking point!   This law has created grotesque inequalities in the home by giving women the power to imprison men with one call to the police with a false claim of abuse.    So women being able to call the police when their husbands do illegal things is ""creating inequalities? ""False claims of abuse"" What? Does this guy just think that all men are perfect fucking angels or some shit? 'Cause that is what is seems like.   This act effectively replaces a husband as head of the household with the government, creating family distrust and further enslaving and controlling a man’s behavior by requiring him to comply with whims of the state.   And why, exactly, should men be the de facto heads of the household? Maybe you should focus less on the State and more on your own, patriarchal privilege asshole.   Enforce equality of the law and due process. If a man and woman both drink during sexual encounters, the law must treat them equally instead of placing the burden of consent solely on the male.   You know what? Just fuck it. This guy is beyond hope.   Repeal or forbid laws that regulate sexuality, sex, or bedroom activity.

You see a lot more male-on-male attacks (and, in rare cases, women do harass or attack men, usually when they outrank the victim) than in the general public.   The idea is never to distract from or diminish the victimization of women in the force, but to reverse the culture that tolerates harassment and assault across the board.  EDIT: And, as the article points out, while the military has been successful in encouraging more women to speak out when they're attacked or harassed, it seems to be more difficult for men to speak up, partly because of the perception that men cannot be victimized in this way."

I understand that that's unfortunate, but maybe I'm naively optimistic in believing that this shows that there are actual issues that the men's rights movement could address, and that with reform it could perhaps be something that is valuable in our society. Honestly, this article does seem to point to an underlying problem where I think men understandably feel like feminism isn't really for issues related to men (not saying its against men, but rather that its nature is biased towards problems which affect women) - nothing wrong with that, but we either need to modify feminism to make it feel more approachable for men to address ways in which gender norms have harmed them, or we need to find a way to reform the men's rights movement to actually care about important issues like this one instead of just focusing on anti-feminism."

I don't think the men's rights movement can be reformed: It's not really even a ""movement"" but, as you point out, just people pushing back against feminism.  This does get discussed within feminism: For example, this discussion about rape culture in the military on /r/feminism is two years old, but it's about precisely the topic we're discussing.  As for what to do to make feminism more ""approachable"" for men, I don't know. For my part, I'm a white cis male and I'm firmly on the side of feminism, but it still feels weird to call myself a feminist, especially online. It's partly a problem of the forum where these ideas get talked about online, within the wider discourse of call-out culture and language activism. I'm not interested in putting anyone's label on my shield and wading into all the flaming and trolling that passes for discussion online.

It depends a bit on the country. But if you google for things like well-being, quality of life and happiness you'll find such things as spending power, security, leisure, family, education, health, mental health and happiness. This list was off the top of my head. Remember that these kinds of indicators must take into account what is already measured in a reliable way. Thus health, for example, is often measured by the lifespan. We know that women tend to be happier, they have a better education, they have more leisure time they can spend the way they want, women face far less violence and live in better neighborhoods (because they are not discriminated against by landlords), women have better health (when measured by lifespan and suicides) and women spend more time with their family (something many men regret that they didn't). Spending power is something that isn't so clear cut, but it's common wisdom that women spend much more than men and make purchasing decisions much more often than men. Another way to look at this to consider what is the probability of a really miserable life (homelessness, jail and so on). And we all know that for men the probability is much greater.    Huh. Not a single link or number in there. Imagine that.   How's this for a statistic?"

If anything, it is feminists who actively argue against such a notion that men and women have inherently different behaviors. They believe that variations in behavior are social, not biological, and thus, no serious feminist would argue such a thing, especially in 2015. (50 years ago? Eh, maybe. But even then.) Further, the subject is so stereotypical on its face that I have a hard time believing even non-feminists making such a case.  What seems more likely is that the presentation in question was nuanced: Perhaps suggesting that toxic masculinity in certain cultures has affected men negatively, and that the presence of women in positions of power can help to dilute that cultural trope. (Note that this is not a perspective I'd agree with, but it would certainly be more complex than the OP suggests.)  Truth is that I wasn't there, so I couldn't say what actually happened. But what we find so often on /r/MensRights is the claim, ""OMG there was a feminist outcry about this!!"" when, in fact, they can find no written case of a feminist making such a claim, and the alleged ""outcry"" is completely unevidenced. The above is such a case. It's pure strawfeminist. In the worst case, the guy made this up.

I had a sociology professor who held very controversial beliefs, but one day (i forget the reason) we must have been discussing males, maybe, in the context of third wave feminism and I think for whatever reason she felt possessed to look at this room of 25 or so students and say ""And boys should get circumcised. I don't want to hear any arguments about it,"" or something to that effect. No one argued with her and the room had been pretty much silent until that point, as well. It seemed she just wanted to say it quickly and approach the potential for an argument head-on without letting it get out of hand. Needless to say I was quiet and simply learned to very carefully watch my mouth and stay silent for the rest of the term. BUT, i'm convinced that was that and this is this.   (I think I was just giving an example in my past where this happened. And it was my first semester at college, too, so it made me uncomfortable about speaking my mind in general with professors.)

Interesting that there's no link to this alleged article of mine this person read that TOTALLY CHANGED MY MIND RIGHT GUIZE.  As for the alleged lies:   men's rights groups attempt to take money from going to women's shelters   AVFM set up a phony ""white ribbon campaign"" that seems pretty clearly intended to screw with the real ""white ribbon ca,paign,"" and included a donation button that would go not to any programs to support abuse victims but to running the site. At least one person claims to have donated to AVFM's fake ""white ribbon"" site b/c they thought it was the real one. But the real isssue here isn't the money; it's that AVFM is using extremely underhanded and I would think illegal tactics to fuck with a real anti-violence charity.    MRAs are misogynists   Uh, lots of them are. Many are proud of it.    Suggested Paul Elam supports rape (quoted him out of context)   I've never suggested that he, you know, goes around telling men to rape women. I did quote him saying that he would never vote to convict a rapist, even if the rapist was clearly guilty.   Men talk s*** about women (talking about MGTOWS)   What does this even mean? Of course lots of men talk shit about women. Many MGTOWs pretty much do so all day every day; just go to their message boards.    MRAs are associated with pick up artists ...   Some are, some aren't. But there's a huge overlap in the worldviews of MRAs and PUAs.   Also, if this person went to AVFM in the last week and found lots of great articles, guize, they must have missed the posts titled ""Removing your nuts for the she-squirrel,"" Janet Bloomfield's article suggesting that it should be a felony for a woman to have a child unless the father agrees, Elam's post saying that the ""MHRM"" is really only about ""talking"" online and not actually about trying to set up shelters and so on."
againstmensrights,2zbhq6,Sinister_Hand,6,Tue Mar 17 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"That last bit is what gets me.

It's not projection though, it's that the internet is their entire frame of reference. I had this bonkers discussion like a year ago in r/mr where some poster was saying that the mens rights ""movement"" couldn't take responsibility for what people on AVFM, PUA forums and /r/theredpill etc do since they're not a part of the same ""movement"". They have an incredibly flawed definition of a movement where if you post on even another forum than they then they're not a part of the same movement. They are so caught up in intentions that they can't understand practice. ""Well, I don't FEEL like an X and I don't think X things, that must mean I'm not an X"". When in reality - movements aren't a framework of thoughts or feelings, they are a gathering of practices, and anyone taking part in those practices is therefore a part of the movement. They need to understand what the word Movement is, they need to reflect on why it's even called a Movement.   Whether or not mens righters call themselves ""libertarians"", ""liberals"" or anything else - that doesn't matter. They're still part of a neo-reactionary movement for instance."

I was initially lured here by a Trailer Park Boys IAMA in 2011. Within a week of beginning to post and read regularly, I began noticing constant references to ""SRS"" and how terrible they are. I had no idea who ""SRS"" was, and in my state the Human Services department that handles families in crisis is called the department of social and rehabilitative services, or SRS for short, so I wondered if it had something to do with that. Then I realized it was just a bunch of basically troll subreddits where they make fun of some of the worst things they find being said in the biggest subreddits. This was how I figured out how dismayingly bigoted the majority of default-subs posters are.  Now, I have tended to frequent boards in my life where there were a lot of misogynists and racists, but because they were boards about subjects that are well-liked by far-right wackos, like heavy metal music and wrestling I was at least sort of prepared for the shit when I encountered it. But I have to admit I was shocked by just how misogynistic and racist reddit was, because it's such a huge community I assumed the idiocy of the people on my smaller communities would be harder to find. Naively, I thought that because reddit was so vast and had people from so many different countries weighing in with opinions, it would somehow have relegated its misogynist and racist troglodytes to their own small corner. It was a rude awakening because I can no longer kid myself that these bigotries are confined only to the dumbest Americans, which was what I thought before."

This is actually provably untrue: according to a study by the London School of Economics, more women than men die during natural disasters, for a variety of reasons related to gender roles and women's perceived lower value in many (let's face it, most) societies. Moreover, according to the WHO, women and girls are also expected to take on additional caregiving roles in the aftermath of natural disasters, which damages their health and well-being in ways that men and boys don't generally experience.

Evaluators penalized female candidates more than male candidates for initiating negotiations. In Experiment 3, participants evaluated videotapes of candidates who accepted compensation offers or initiated negotiations. Male evaluators penalized female candidates more than male candidates for initiating negotiations; female evaluators penalized all candidates for initiating negotiations. Perceptions of niceness and demandingness explained resistance to female negotiators. In Experiment 4, participants adopted the candidate’s perspective and assessed whether to initiate negotiations in same scenario used in Experiment 3.

Chances are you come to reddit because it is the de facto forum for your interests just like why most of us are here. This subreddit probably doesn't share much of a user base as /r/all or the subreddits outlined in this article. If reddit went under really all that would be lost from the internet is the small portion of /r/all content that is OC, something I think the world would be just fine without. If we don't support reddit's policy or even the larger idea of reddit and are only here because we have no where else to go why should our advertising dollars go to support a company that clearly doesn't share our morals?"

No, we wouldn't. Because that would make the community shit (or, more shit). But I believe (and it's strange I'm on a site where this is apparently a controversial statement) that not allowing groups like MRAs, neo nazis, repillers, etc to propagate would improve the overall community.  Like, I get what you're saying; we don't want that to happen to us, so we shouldn't try to make it happen to other groups, and so on. It's Golden Rule type stuff, but I think that's simplistic in this case. You have to look at the impact each group has, what they promote, what benefits and detriments they bring to the site as a whole, or to society as a whole. And it's ok to, as a site, have a political opinion, to say ""no, these aims are not ours and we don't want to provide this group with a platform"".   I get why they allow anybody and everybody to say whatever. They see themselves as more than a website, they see themselves as some kind of internet in its own right.   Yeah, they've expressed that a few times and, frankly, it's stupid. Reddit's always had delusions of grandeur (""Front page of the internet""-- fucking really? And how about after The Fappening when they essentially said that Reddit is a country?) and vastly overestimated their own importance.  Beyond that, they stick to this bizzaro-Libertarian idea where complete unmoderated conversation leads to everyone being included and the votes and community consensus will sort it all out. That sounds nice, but it doesn't work, it never has, and I'm kinda shocked people still think it does. It leads to whatever the biggest groups are (for Reddit, that would be white straight cis men) dominating the conversation and pushing other groups to the sidelines. Fuck, look at the Chans for the perfect case study (though note, they tend to pretend that they're super inclusive, but only with their myopic view of inclusion: as in, you're welcome to be a minority on the site if you never challenge our assumption that you're a straight white man, and if you ever do bring up that you're not you're obviously an attention whore)."

A place to provoke some discussion among like-minded people who are otherwise a minority on Reddit and often just a place to have a sarcastic laugh at the expense of the MRAs.

The most upvoted posts on there are often tagged as women behaving badly and link to news stories about women who did bad things. If these were stories about women who did bad things who were clearly punished lightly or not at all just because they were women, I could understand that. But most of the time the women in the linked stories ARE being punished for their wrongdoing and the guys in there just sit around venting how terrible it is that terrible women do terrible things. Too often, the underlying attitude there seems to be ""Because some women are very bad, no women deserve any of the gains feminism has made for them, and all of feminism is bad because it has failed to make all women perfect.""  There's also a lot of complaining about ""female privilege"", by which they usually mean the treats, gifts and social perks that powerful men dole out to attractive women. If it's something that is completely and totally still at the whim of men, and is not consistently applied to all women but only the most sexually desirable ones, then it's not a ""female privilege"", it's a quid pro quo. To reap these ""privileges"" things are expected in return, and if those things aren't given the ""privileges"" can be taken away. When we talk about the concept of privilege, we are talking about the benefits reaped by the people who've traditionally made all of the rules, ie, white guys. Nobody can revoke these privileges because they're only shared at the top of the food chain. I know poor white guys don't feel like they're privileged, but there are even aspects of being poor that are easier for white guys than for women or minorities. Privilege is a difficult concept for the people who derive benefit from it, because they don't even realize what some of those benefits are."

Leaving aside any scholarship involved, and I do believe there is some, he rereleased it last year for a 20th anniversary edition, on which the cover has the silhouette of a female figure, back, hip and backside, because looking at a beautiful woman is to remind men the power of a beautiful woman has on the thinking and actions of men. Even allowing for a savvy marketing ploy, being told from the cover of a book that I, as a man, am oppressed because a woman only makes me think with my cock, is not a good start.  Elam is a dog-whistling opportunist, who genuinely appears to hate women, who claims his speech is satire when challenged and who seems more inclined to employ his rhetoric to fleece the men he claims to be speaking for/to.   These can be claimed to be the word and the prophet of the men's rights movement and even if they only appeal to a small coterie of admirers, the deafening silence from the moderate wing, if such a thing exists, is telling."

Oh, no, sorry I just checked my Warren Farrell 365 quotes of the year calendar and it filled me in on what's going on. I forgot that men are slaves to the mighty lady butt and what she did therefore counts as coercion!   [Edit!!!!!!] A nice mister has provided a great explanation for why this is awful, and is currently at [+22]   Not exactly. When any man anywhere will lower himself to such depths, mens perceived values everywhere are lowered as well. The value of most men to a woman, is how readily she can duplicate his resources. When they can extract mens resources easily, then men in general are worth less because those resources arent as rare. Why do women act the way they do? Because they know dam well they can basically get what they want from almost whoever they want, when they want. Now they are spoiled, and their behavior reflects that fact. Pussy ass men are basically to blame for womens behavior.   [Edit 2!!] And another, much more concise comment at [+10]   I wish men weren't enslaved to pussy   And another comment that I was hoping a nice mister could wander into here and clarify for me that is sitting at [+17]   One of the most damaging aspects of feminism is the way it insists men are worthless unless they are having sex."

What is most problematic is how manipulative the whole thing is, it exploits another's loneliness, the writer's attitude reminds me of pick up artists/redpill bullshit.    She went on tinder, on Valentine's day, exploiting lonely men out for any human interaction to do physical labor for her, likely on the hope that some connection will happen and her message is some sort of test (or else why would it be on Tinder).   This is messed up, at least to me. People who are alone miss feeling needed, but that doesn't give other people license to pass on unpleasant tasks to them.   She didn't lie to anyone, but she could have used craig's list, or a paid service like taskrabbit.

If we do agree that it's okay to have preferences that include not having romantic interest in women based on their sexual history, does the objection come from the being honest part?

While I don't get behind the idea of calling women sluts or degrading them for past sexual history, I do staunchly stick up for men to exercise the ability to prefer partners with less sexual history. As far as traditionalism vs progressiveness goes, I think any women, men, and non-binary people should be able to chose for themselves to adhere to traditional values or not - I don't think people who are traditional should be pressured to adopt the values of people who are progressive into their personal life or vice versa."

Because I think the reason is actually pretty important here. I can completely understand wanting a partner who isn't much more experienced than you, because of insecurity or whatever (I've been there, though even in that case number of sexual partners doesn't actually = sexual experience). I can even kind of understand wanting to be with someone who is and has always been monogamous and who doesn't enjoy casual encounters because that's something you wouldn't have in common (though if it's in the past I don't see why it would matter that much but TMMV). But beyond that... why? I can't come up with any other reason that doesn't treat a sexually experienced woman as ""unclean"" or ""damaged goods"" and I'm genuinely interested.  Conversely, I think it's fine to want to be with someone more sexually experienced because you want them to either match your level of sexual experience, or because you don't want to be the one to show them stuff for the first time, or because you don't want the pressure of their first time being with you, or something similar, but I think it's pretty icky to not want to date a virgin because ""eww virgins are gross nerds"" or whatever.  Having sexual preferences is fine, but most preferences don't develop in a vacuum and I think it's also fine to acknowledge when they reflect or reinforce problematic social phenomena."

I'm sure for guys who have a certain upper limit in mind it either has to do with their own performance insecurities, religious values, or possibly notions that a woman with a higher partner count is less likely to be faithful (which would only matter in a long term relationship, and may be an erroneous notion to begin with).

Yeah, men shouldn't need to pay child support for kids that aren't theirs. Yes, it shouldn't be allowed that a mother can give up a kid for adoption / drop it off without asking the father. If the law allows this, it needs to be changed. Those are legitimate issues.  Mixing them with silly whining about womens right to abort and the very concept of child support is stupid though."
againstmensrights,2y4tt6,Doldenberg,2,Fri Mar 6 15:54:59 2015 UTC,I wonder how many mothers are forced to give the kid up because the father already skipped off?  I doubt it's women doing it frivolously.
againstmensrights,2y4tt6,grumpyfairy,3,Sat Mar 7 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, men shouldn't need to pay child support for kids that aren't theirs.   Well, maybe. MRA's forget the other side of the coin...men who take care of a child that's not theirs, whether knowingly or unknowingly, but have bonded with that child and would like to have rights to the child. I mean, a blanket ban on requiring support of such children would probably include a ban of rights too so that hurts children,  and men who want to remain involved. If the law can just say, ""hey you're not the real dad so fuck off now"" then I can definitely see that screwing over men who stepped in and were involved but getting no rights in the end."
againstmensrights,2y4tt6,uh_sure_,2,Sat Mar 7 03:23:28 2015 UTC,"I dare to say that it is possible to make a law that allows having both; men not having to pay child support for children that aren't theirs, and men being able to have rights for children they want to care for."
againstmensrights,2y4tt6,Doldenberg,2,Sat Mar 7 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't have all the answers to this issue. The way it works now is that it's recognized as being in the best interest of the child to continue being supported by the person who acted as a parent for a meaningful period of time. I'm not sure I disagree with that. Not entirely, anyway.   Ieas....  -mandatory counseling for unwed men before signing a birth certificate. Inform them of the rights and responsibilities that come with it.   -opt-out paternity testing at birth (or, upon being made aware of the child in cases where the father is not present at birth). I disagree with mandatory paternity testing but I think an opt-out system would be alright. Offer the test, man can choose to take it or not before signing the birth certificate. Again, with counseling on the implications of taking or not taking the test.   Those ideas would at least protect men from the get-go. They'd be able to make fully informed decisions and not get unwittingly stuck in a bad situation down the line."
againstmensrights,2y4tt6,uh_sure_,3,Sat Mar 7 19:17:36 2015 UTC,"Also, MRA's talk about men being forced to pay child support for kids who aren't theirs like it's a super common occurrence, just like they do with fake rape claims. It seems to me that it's much more likely that it happens very occasionally, or happens the way you said: the guy isn't being forced to pay, he's choosing to pay to support a kid he cares about.

I agree with some of their other issues on parental rights though, but I'm sure those are the same issues feminists would agree with as well.  I've had many arguments about how the biological process of child birth is inherently ""unfair"" and since you cannot force a woman to have an abortion of she doesn't want one, then you make the decision to have the posibility of a child when you have sex.  and the idea of promoting ""fairness"" is really weird when you are trying to be allowed to commit an act that is intended to create children and be completely free of responsibility for what generally is the outcome of the act."

Of course, he is  either a) mistaking a female voice for ""singing weakly"", or b) not understanding the point of singing weakly about your feelings.  Singing in a tone that is ""weak"" sounding you are using tone to convey something that words written on a page never could:  The vulnerability that comes with introspection about your emotions.    That being said, my interpretation of his post is no more charitable than yours...  If his thinking is case a) mistaking feminine tone of voice for weak tone of voice, then he is a misogynisitic idiot.

But MRAs proposed solution for this particular issue is to doubt all rape out-criers and put them through even more of a wringer to justify their victimhood, when it's already difficult to come forward. Also, just because it can't be proven that a rape occurred doesn't mean the victim is lying, and punishing her/him with incarceration will make another victim think thrice about coming forward.

(I would even argue that today more and more women are looking for men who behave this way in bed, because most men today have been beaten into being puppydogs and manginas by our matriarchial, gynocentric, feminist, man-hating culture.)   Just no words to adequately describe how vomit-inducing this kind of language is.  Seriously this is bullshit. The guy who assaulted me didn't listen to my numerous ""I don't want to""s, my ""no""s and eventually I just gave up because otherwise he was going to keep stalking and harassing me and being violent. I even had an orgasm because you can't always control that bullshit. I can just see my ex adopting this kind of argument if I were to ever confront him about what he did.  Seriously the Male Rapists Activists should do nothing more than fuck themselves and stay the hell away from everyone else. They are the worst kind of people."

I could have worded it slightly more accurately, but I was not saying that all women who have undergone FGM can come to a clitoral orgasm.  It's just as likely that they are able to as it is for an unmutilated woman to be able to.  It's comparable to the unmutilated population.  Type 4 is one of the more extreme types, I'm sorry your roommate had to experience that.  Here's one bit of evidence, and here's another, and another.  I'd love to see more research on this, but unfortunately there isn't much.   In accordance with other research, the present study reports that FGM/C women can also have the possibility of reaching an orgasm. Therefore, FGM/C women with sexual dysfunctions can and must be cured; they have the right to have an appropriate sexual therapy.      Scores of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction and pain were comparable between circumcised and uncircumcised groups, while lubrication score was significantly higher in the uncircumcised group      The study found that sexual pleasure and orgasm are still possible after infibulation, and that they rely heavily on cultural influences — when mutilation is lived as a positive experience, orgasm is more likely. When FGC is experienced as traumatic, its frequency drops.   Your roommate experienced FGM as a traumatic experience, I'm guessing - that makes it less likely for her, but it is still possible.  Has she tried to engage in any sexual therapy?  Research shows that men and women who have undergone genital mutilation are able to feel just as much pleasure as those who have not.

They cited the reduction in UTIs, HIV, gonorrhea and HPV infections as potential benefits. I take issue with their interpretation of the literature, as does most of the developed world, as we can prevent and treat these infections with education in safe sex practices, vaccines and antibiotics.

As for false rape accusations:   The largest and most rigorous study that is currently available in this area is the third one commissioned by the British Home Office (Kelly, Lovett, & Regan, 2005). The analysis was based on the 2,643 sexual assault cases (where the outcome was known) that were reported to British police over a 15-year period of time. Of these, 8% were classified by the police department as false reports. Yet the researchers noted that some of these classifications were based simply on the personal judgments of the police investigators, based on the victim’s mental illness, inconsistent statements, drinking or drug use. These classifications were thus made in violation of the explicit policies of their own police agencies. The researchers therefore supplemented the information contained in the police files by collecting many different types of additional data, including: reports from forensic examiners, questionnaires completed by police investigators, interviews with victims and victim service providers, and content analyses of the statements made by victims and witnesses. They then proceeded to evaluate each case using the official criteria for establishing a false allegation, which was that there must be either “a clear and credible admission by the complainant”5 or “strong evidential grounds” (Kelly, Lovett, & Regan, 2005). On the basis of this analysis, the percentage of false reports dropped to 2.5%.   http://www.ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_3_no_1_2009.pdf"

Of course it's women who have to be pregnant so theu should make the ultimate choice whether to keep the child or not, but once the child is born, this is where it gets equal. If the woman can choose whether to take care of the child or just drop it off to adoption and forfeit its care, both physical and financial, then the man should have the choice not to be involved in the child's life neither physically nor financially."
againstmensrights,2x44jl,Sunjammer0037,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"A mother can't just give away a kid if the father objects to it. If the kid is given away then the father benefits just as much as the mother financially. If he objects then he can take the child and sue her for support. If the mother gives birth and abandons the child then the father has the exact same rights to either drop it off at a safe haven, adopt it out or keep it and sue for support.  Let's break it down...  Man and woman have sex. Woman gets pregnant.  She chooses abortion:  -both benefit equally if both want abortion.  -father benefits if he wants it but she doesn't and does it anyway  -father is disadvantaged if mother aborts against his wishes  The only time a father is in a true disadvantage is if HE wants the baby and she aborts. Otherwise, both mother and father are on equal grounds. They both have the same  responsibilities...or lack of, rather, if she aborts.   The mother is just as responsible for the child as the father is once it is born.  Mother gives birth:  -either both parents are legally equally responsible or none are if the child is given up (which both must agree upon unless one parent is dead or cannot be located)  It's not unfair. It's exactly fair. The child has the RIGHT to be supported by its biological parents. Child support is a human right recognized worldwide. The biological parents have the responsibility to contribute to the care of their children before anyone else (before the state and before the taxpayers).   If we let biological parents out of respinsibility for the children they create, that is completely unfair to 1. The child 2. The taxpayers. How is it more fair to let those directly responsible for the child's existence off the hook and make everybody else pay for it in taxes? How does it benefit men to allow ""some"" men to avoid responsibility for their children by making ""ALL"" men pay more in taxes for those children?  What about homelessness? MRA's supposedly care about homeless boys and men. Well, unsupported boys will be at more risk of poverty and homelessness.  What about suicide? Homeless fatherless unsupported boys are surely more at risk for suicide.  Boys in poverty are more likely to have all kinds of negatives...more likely to be incarcerated? Raped? Hungry? Depressed?  So you're telling me that it's better to let a few deadbeats off on their child support obligations so that ALL men together can end up paying for it, and society can pay the price too, but MOST importantly all those children can go without the support that is their basic human right?  Yeah...fighting the good fight for boys and men!  Ok."

For the most part, unless a dickhead journalist jumps the gun or there's some conspiracy to put someone behind bars, cops don't really care about domestic issues. For men or women. There's so little proof and the dynamics throw them off.  Most kinds of violence, as much as I hate to say this, is predominately (but not exclusively) initiated by men, due to testosterone differences. Women commit crimes all the fucking time, but as far as things like rape and deadly violence, they still have a male majority. I'm not saying men are evil or that no woman has ever killed or raped someone. What I saying by this is there is no huge favor for female victims. No one gets taken seriously for domestic issues, and the ratio of male and female perps who get time is not as unfair as they are seeing.  I hope this makes sense...I'm really tired.  I feel bad for her that she shared something so personal to a trash community.  Edit: http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280915.php   Here is proof of testosterone influencing aggressive behavior.

Suddenly I'm an awful feminist for being angry for having my boundary violated. And my only crime would be walking outside as a woman. Apparently that is me bringing it upon myself according to American men.  If I'm raped, I'd be told I was making a false accusation unless I taped the entire incident so those perverted  voyeurs can watch and make insensitive rape jokes. And I'd be an evil feminist if I'm offended at that.  Then I'd be blamed anyways for what I wore as if I deserved it.  And while were on topic of perverts, that's wrong too because that's apparently just ""nature"" to be attracted to children. According to pedophiles. Who apparently feel they have rights to behave this way. they feel they should be protected from any consequences of their actions. And creeps, that's apparently a bad word compared to be equally bad to the worst names to call a woman. Because a guy doing inappropriate behaviour also feels he has rights and being denied his behaviour is a violation.  And masturbating to images they find of a woman online, that's apparently their right too and denying this is a violation of their right. And if I am offended at that, I'd deserve to be ridiculed on reddit and told that I deserve to be punched in the face because I took an exception to it and called it a crime.  And while were at it, turning down men you don't want to date or responding to their compliments that aren't positive is me being an evil slur. Because again, I'm not allowed personal boundaries and have to behave just right around all guys, as if I'm being paid to tolerate and baby sit their delicate ego.   When leaving the house If I don't dress or have the right weight or age that is appealing to a mans sexual attraction, I deserve to be ridiculed.  If I don't laugh at their jokes, I am told I should kill myself immediately.  If I were beaten, I'd be blamed because I must have said something to deserve it.

Did women experience a lot of sexism and didn't have lots of rights? Sure. But it's not like men were free to act however they wanted either. Besides, historically you can't lump all men and all women together - there was much bigger difference between the treatment of women of different class/social group than between men and women of the same class/social group. Ironically, lower social classes were often more equal between men and women than the upper noble class. Noble males had most power and arguably had best lives, but men of lower class hardly had any power - even at home they didn't exactly ""rule"" over their wives or anything - in some regions women were the ones who had more authority at home.  However, when MRAs insist that men were the ones oppressed while women had and still have it super easy compared to men and didn't/don't have to take any responsibilities while men bear all the burden, I'm going to take the feminist side immediately.   (aka toiling the fields and working hard to show little for it)   Women were working in the fields just as hard as men, though - and also had to take care of children and the home and be either pregnant or breastfeeding most of the time.

Guess they missed the research about how women are punished for trying to negotiate raises (men are not).    In repeated studies, the social cost of negotiating for higher pay has been found to be greater for women than it is for men. Men can certainly overplay their hand and alienate negotiating counterparts. However, in most published studies, the social cost of negotiating for pay is not significant for men, while it is significant for women.   Women are acting rationally in response to gender bias when they avoid negotiating. That said there are also strategies that can manage this risk and of course I encourage women to negotiate if that is right for them. It probably isn't for actors since I doubt most of them are directly involved in negotiating their own salary."

Women and the work they do, in a very real sense, is considered less valuable than men and theirs. All this observation requires is a cursory knowledge of how wages work.  It's not a problem you can negotiate-bootstrap yourself out of, and the idea that such a wage gap exists because women don't negotiate is incredibly condescending, just like every other ""if women aren't equal, it's because they haven't earned it"" argument.

No it doesn't. It acknowledges that reality and points out that it does not account for the difference in pay:   However, the empirical evidence again does not support the argument that work patterns alone are sufficient to explain the gender earnings gap [link].   Besides, choice and discrimination are not mutually exclusive. Many of women's choices are responses to discrimination across the work force, which tends to hold unconscious or explicit bias against women in ""men's work,"" ie any time they transgress their socially prescribed gender roles. Moreover, that society has organized in a way that tends to better reward men's work relative to women's work, independent of human capital investment, is itself an indication of discrimination against women.    could pay one 25% less they would pick that one every time wouldn't they?

(ii) all employment decisions are perfectly informed, rational, and free.  Pick one. The ""best"" labor is not always treated as best. You know that.

So either have women be forced to sign up for the S.S. or they can work to abolish it and prove feminism is ""for men"" as well.  But no...that would take work. Something feminists fucking HATE the idea of if the ""wage gap"" is any indication."
againstmensrights,2wtxsm,slothcough,43,Mon Feb 23 06:19:27 2015 UTC,"how about they turn their attention towards ending the selective service?    You mean like when the League of Women Voters filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case against the draft? Or when the ACLU represented the case by arguing it relegated women to second class citizenship, an argument that was informed by feminist activism of the day? Or maybe more like how the National Organization for Women has clearly/consistently opposed the draft altogether but still advocates against its current gender discrimination? You mean like how many suffragettes of the early 20th century opposed this too? Like how this has been overwhelming consensus for decades among feminists?   The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of this discrimination because women were not allowed (how paternal, thanks matriarchy!) in combat positions. Women have been in combat for all of history but nevermind. Feminists were also involved with the recent repeal of this combat ban.   So learn your history.   But mainly, shame on you for your toxic activism. Don't punish women for a system that discriminates against them by discriminating further. Don't insist on thoughtlessly extending harm to more people just because some are supposedly already subjected to it. Don't discuss this harm without acknowledging it's likelihood (political reality: the draft is already dead). You don't get to willfully withhold women's human dignity until you feel satisfied."

againstmensrights,2wtxsm,grumpyfairy,-27,Mon Feb 23 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Here's my biggest question: Why do feminists like Arquette get to make idiotic statements like she did on a world stage and get a standing ovation, but I make the same sort of blanket statement she does and get chastised for it?  Feminism makes the claim that everything they do is to ""help men"" but all they ever do is whine about ""PATRIARCHY!"" like it's a tangible thing.  Then you have an entire subreddit that will praise Arquette like she is the next Lincoln. It makes no sense."

But I also provided a link that specifically states how men in America are forced to sign their life away or else lose 250,000 dollars and 5 years of their life which I think covers that 23 cents an hour gap that doesn't exist.  That is a real issue. Manspreading isn't. The Wage gap isn't. Men LOSE ACTUAL RIGHTS by not signing up for the S.S. and bringing that to the attention of the people bitching that there is an MRA thread about an actress spouting lies for personal gain isn't extreme. It's pointing out how fucking stupid they are for whining about a ""wage gap"" that doesn't exist."

Or if you insist that the obligation to forcibly serve your nation in the military should be gender neutral, get off your ass and campaign for that!

Rich white women wanting to be as rich as their male counterparts are irrelevant to feminism and I'm entirely unimpressed with what she did. Lower class women can only dream of the financial security she has.   Too bad most of these men only care about an excuse to throw misogynist slurs around.  edit: omg why are they babbling about the military again like they're victims when they blow up people in other countries?

againstmensrights,2wtxsm,psirynn,-9,Mon Feb 23 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"Idk, I'm not really concerned with the fact that rich as fuck women are not as rich as fuck as rich as fuck dudes, you know? If those same women were sexually harassed it would still be misogyny and unacceptable. It's however also unacceptable that these people are rich while poor people (women, especially) in the very same country have/make enough to barely survive. So yes, I am not impressed by rich women applauding each other.   Solution would be simple though: have rich dudes make less. Nobody needs that much money."

Rich white women wanting to be as rich as their male counterparts are irrelevant to feminism   This isn't ""I don't give a fuck about this specific example of inequality because it affects people I don't like"", this is ""NO ONE should give a fuck about this specific example of inequality"". Some people are able to multitask. Some people are able to care about multiple things. Some people are able to factor in facets of privilege not relating directly to gender and recognize that while the effects of sexism differ in severity based on those other facets, it exists at every level and is still worthy of being criticized. If you can't, that's your problem. It doesn't mean you're somehow sticking up for lower class women, it just means you suck at intersectionality."
againstmensrights,2wtxsm,psirynn,-9,Mon Feb 23 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"Intersectionality has nothing to do with caring about rich women, too. And yes, I stand by the statement that it is irrelevant to feminism, because I understand feminism as liberation from patriarchy for all women. If rich women demand to make as much money as their rich male collagues, it doesn't bring us closer to that goal.

I think it's less about the rate at which men commit crimes and more about the rate at which women who have committed crimes are generally given lesser sentences for similar offenses, or even have their cases outright dismissed.

I think that women do get lesser punishments in the court systems but the solution isn't to make women's punishments harsher it is to treat everyone in the court of law like a human being and have some empathy when it is warranted.
