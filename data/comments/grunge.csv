grunge,3e5sx5,GenerationWasteland,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:27:16 2015 UTC,The Distortion Bit and Vocals are great. The stripped part sounds too much like SILVERCHAIR BLIND and Nirvana Heart Shaped Box. But Hey whatever. It's GOOD.
grunge,3e5sx5,WadeYaeger,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:32:27 2015 UTC,"I like the vocals but I think you're limiting yourself by attempting at making ""grunge"" music. I can tell by the guitar work and song dynamics that grunge obviously plays a large influence, and I really hate to sound like i'm putting down your work, but this honestly sounds like ""just another grunge band"". I'd suggest (and maybe you already do, i don't know) exploring different styles, especially with a voice like your singers, don't limit yourself by trying too hard to mimic your heroes."
grunge,3e5sx5,Evilfetus155,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"We differently don't. This is the only song that sounds super grungy that we recorded. Thats why I only posted this song and not the entire playlist of songs. The entire group of songs does have a grunge influence, but its certainly not going to be a grunge album. I will consider this though. Thanks for the feedback."
grunge,3e5poe,WadeYaeger,2,Wed Jul 22 03:57:03 2015 UTC,"Andy Wood was a life cut short. The real tragedy is that he didn't live to see Apple come out.  Chris Cornell felt the blunt of the tragedy too, since they had been roommates and friends.   Kurt also died young, but he had his time to shine. He hated the fame.  I doubt Andy would have, considering his flamboyant stage persona. Finally, Kurt took his own life. He wasn't stolen from us. Andy died so much more suddenly and unexpectedly.    Finally, grunge was kinda on its way out of popularity. It would be better just to give a moment of silence then try to force something commercially. Frankly, I doubt that Kurt would want an album made in his honor."
grunge,3e5poe,WhiteLightRising,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:45:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess the fact Kurt indeed for sure wasn't going to be forgotten I guess there was no reason to cement him in the music world with a tribute album ;p

grunge,3dzi2k,10Miles,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but this is not within my personal definition of Grunge. When I think grunge, I think of pearl jam, soundgarden, Alice in chains, stone temple pilots, seven Mary three, silverchair, toadies, etc. a lot of that had a lot more musicianship to it than Nirvana styled grunge, which I suspect you're aiming for here. That's all well and good, and if your lyrics are as interesting as Kurt's were and if your drummer was as awesome as Dave Grohl you'd be in good shape, but the vocals I can't get on board with, and the music wasn't emotive enough for my liking. But best of luck to you and keep writing and performing. If you love what you're doing then just do you. Chances are there are more people out there that love it too."
grunge,3dzi2k,10Miles,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"No worries. I totally appreciate the gulf between the AIC, Soundgarden etc. style grunge and the more Nirvana-y post-punk/indie style that we're closer to. I hope you don't find it inappropriate that we posted here.   Thanks for your feedback."

There's a fundamental change in AIC then, with Cantrell taking greater control through necessity, and to that extent, for the first time. I think you have to take it for that. ""Heaven Beside You"" and ""Grind"" have some of the greatest vocals and riffs of their catalog, IMHO. Guess I know what I'm listening to on the way to work tomorrow..."

grunge,3dbvy3,GeorgeNorman,2,Wed Jul 15 04:01:51 2015 UTC,"I think you have a point, although I disagree in regards to not being able to get into this album. Sure, it probably isn't as good as the others but it's still solid.  As to why it differs from the other albums, I believe it was most likely thrown together with more haste than usual. Now, that's not to say they didn't spend as long working on it as say dirt, but just that the time spent probably wasn't as productive as they'd like. Also I have a suspicion that some of the songs were ones that maybe jerry had written earlier that probably wouldn't have made the grade if the band was more stable at the time. Lastly, I think there was an effort to evolve and change their sound just a little bit. Mainly though slightly more muddled, darker distortion on guitar and vocals. But all in all it's still a great album in my opinion, heck of a lot better than we get now a days."
grunge,3dbvy3,huntedhunter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"I remember Jerry saying that watching Layne nod off during studio time was incredibly difficult to watch. The dude had such a problem, and they probably needed to rush production.   However, I disagree about albums not being good these days. I love the 90's, but Godsmack's latest album is pretty good, and I found a band called Wolf Alice, and they're just a blast from the past. Even AIC's latest two albums have been pretty rockin."

grunge,3cui9t,CaptainDefect,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:33:36 2015 UTC,It's hard to classify the melvins as grunge. They are wicked all over the place you have no idea what you're going to get. Not a bad thing it's just tough to classify them to one genre

They are closer to metal on Screaming Life/Fopp, heavier and sludgy on Badmotorfinger, and closer to rock on Down on the Upside.  King Animal has elements of all of these types.    If anything, I find Nirvana closer to pop."

grunge,3cui9t,Evilfetus155,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ""Bleach"" is IMO the perfect example of the ""Grunge"" sound whereas an album such as ""In Utero"" is very much an alternative pop album."

grunge,3cui9t,SickSinceSunday,2,Sat Jul 11 06:09:00 2015 UTC,In Utero still blows my mind. There is so much rage spilling through.  My guess/opinion is that he was fully realizing how much he was being used to further  other people's goals and ambitions.

grunge,3c6kjt,liableAccount,2,Sun Jul 5 09:45:06 2015 UTC,I meant studio release. That version is actually a decent version though
grunge,3c8367,mp2014,5,Sun Jul 5 19:56:37 2015 UTC,"Layne's voice peaked in the early Facelift and Dirt days. Listen to any live song from '91-'94. Man in the Box, Sea of Sorrow, and It Ain't Like That are great examples of amazing live performances. I think they (for the most part) sound better than the studio recordings.  I find AiC unplugged to be one of their best performances ever. However, Layne's voice at that point has noticeably deteriorated, on top of the fact that he has to sing Heavy songs in a quieter acoustic manner.   By the time you get to the ""Tripod"" album in 1996/7, his voice is but a shell of its former self. It's still haunting and snarly, but it has lost nearly all of the punch from his glory days.   It is most likely due to drug abuse, especially heroin.   Of the Big 4, Layne's voice was the ""softest."" He didn't have the earth shattering shrieking range of Cornell, he didn't have Kurt's aggressive yelps and growls. But he did have a unique, strange, and beautiful voice. Combined with Cantrell in a two man harmony, I would say that AiC's sound is the most memorable IMO."
grunge,3c8367,GeorgeNorman,3,Mon Jul 6 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"Agree. It's perhaps an unpopular opinion, but I prefer ""Nutshell"" from Jar of Flies to the Unplugged version, simply because Layne's voice on JOF is still at its peak. I love Unplugged but it's difficult for me to hear the damage done to Layne's voice. '94-'96 were tough years for him, I think, on the drugs front."
grunge,3c8367,luynes,4,Thu Jul 9 13:29:12 2015 UTC,I don't think Kurt honestly once sounded the same live as in the studio. His vocal performances are always giving 110% but wildly inconsistent.

grunge,39jz8i,L3aBoB3a,0,Fri Jun 12 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"I do love both, and I will definitely agree on the two different styles of music.  Part of it was that I knew the Cash version before the Soundgarden one, I grew up listening to Johnny.  The rest of it is that raw feeling created by Johnny's deep voice and that acoustic guitar. The original Soundgarden song has fantastic guitar work that the song feels driven by, here it's driven by Cash."
grunge,39jz8i,baconbash,0,Sat Jun 13 00:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kinda how music works. You have a deeper connection to Johnny. I think you got downvoted bc people perceived your comment as saying that the original SG version is not good at all. In case you haven't seen it, check out Johnny performing the song live on Leno."

It just seems like it's all garbage music now. And I was too young to experience those bands in their prime.. It all just seemed to pave the way for post grunge, nu metal, and boring folk/indie bullshit.

Actually some of them do have some valid points, and I totally understand why somebody can find Nevermind both overhyped and not like them nor relate in any way.  I like it, and it has been one of the first albums I ever bought as a teenager and one of the few albums I NEVER get bored of listening.   This does not mean at all I find it perfect, that I don't agree that the production music and vocals are quite far from being excellent.  But still, it is one of the most iconic albums ever.  But to some it's not and they should not be mocked publicly with such an article. There's a reason why most public reviews systems have a ""downvote option"" so if somebody gives a weak and just hate based review he gets less support and his review gets buried like some reddit comments on /r/worldnews"

It's an open submissions kind of thing, so check out the site about how to submit a review of an album you love!  This review was written by my good friend Jeff, who was very influential in my high school years in terms of getting me into some music I hadn't heard before.  Mudhoney was definitely one of the bands he turned me on to, along with Dinosaur Jr, the Melvins, Meat Puppets, Minutemen, etc etc etc  Couldn't be happier to have this be the first album featured in the series.  Immeasurably influential, and still as fresh and visceral 25+ years later.  The kind of album that lends itself very well to a retrospective, or any line of thought that contextualizes it to the era and the genre that it was so inexorably a piece of.    Hope you guys enjoy it.

grunge,35m0fc,LunchpaiI,10,Mon May 11 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot of things.. Firstly you have to think of grunge a less of a style than a place and time. Seattle early 80's-mid90s.  With that in mind you then have to appreciate how central Mother Love Bone are to the scene, not only is their sound incorporated into bands that followed but the acts associated with them are a key part of Grunge history.  Andrew Wood for instance was in Malfunkshun which were featured on the breakout Grunge compliation ""Deep Six"" which is generally considered the start point for the genre.  You've already mentioned Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament.  Also the death of Andrew Wood is part of grunge history (place and time remember). Temple of the Dog were a tribute band formed in Andrew Woods honour. Layne Staley often sung about how his friend died and feared he would die that way too (which he did).  A couple of awesome tribute songs include Would? - AiC and Reach Down by Temple of the Dog  Edit: Here is  Say Hello to Heaven - Live Chris Cornell. Chris and Andrew Wood were room mates and good friends. I think you can feel the emotional pain in Chris in this song.  TLDR - Grunge is about place and time. MLB are part of the history"
grunge,35m0fc,GenestealerUK,6,Mon May 11 17:58:03 2015 UTC,"Also the death of Andrew Wood is part of grunge history   I honestly think, had Andrew Wood survived, that Mother Love Bone would be holding the place Nirvana does today. Or, more likely, that Grunge wouldn't be seen as a unified scene as it is today, but the split between the more Punk influenced bands (Nirvana, Green River) and the Heavy Metal acts (Soundgarden and MLB) would be more pronounced."
grunge,35m0fc,Clovis69,5,Mon May 11 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"I'm old, but I remember reading about Apple's release and how MLB was going to be the THING in Rolling Stone.  Then Andrew Wood died.  That was going to be the summer of 1990.  If he'd lived, they might have been on the first Lollapalooza, grunge would have broke a year early."
grunge,35m0fc,Clovis69,2,Mon May 11 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"Same! He was clearly poised to be the front man for the scene and the ""spokesman for a generation"" thing Kurt hated so much.  It'd be so interesting to see the world where someone with the exact opposite personality held that title."
grunge,35m0fc,GenestealerUK,2,Mon May 11 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"I have to confess, I still have MLB and Return to Olympus in all my music libraries, even at work  So I'm biased."
grunge,35m0fc,GenestealerUK,2,Mon May 11 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I do too man! Andrew Wood was probably my favorite artist to come out of the whole Seattle scene. The only bands I think really stood up to him at that time were Green River and TAD.  sincerely,  Still trying to find ""God's Balls"" on CD."
grunge,35m0fc,Clovis69,3,Mon May 11 20:13:56 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. MLB was set for the fame that Nirvana had. When I see Kurt Cobain posters, T-shirts and what-not, I can't help but imagine some parallel universe with Andrew Wood's face plastered everywhere instead"
grunge,35m0fc,MrBinns,3,Mon May 11 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Nirvana was obviously a great band and all, but they were definitely an outlier in the Grunge scene, and there's a reason Kurt considered them a Punk band.  I definitely wouldn't mind living in a world where the two main Grunge factions were talked about separately, but it seems nowadays since Grunge isn't really popular that that's what's happening here. It's crazy that Mudhoney and Temple Of The Dog are in the same genre, ha."
grunge,35m0fc,ilikemyteasweet,3,Mon May 11 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"That would probably mean Pearl Jam never existed, too.

grunge,35m0fc,Clovis69,3,Mon May 11 19:33:15 2015 UTC,Yeah that thought has also occurred. No Pearl Jam.... No Temple of the Dog. Wonder if we'd even know who Eddie Vedder was

grunge,35m0fc,ottoplainview,2,Mon May 11 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"fantastic write up... to carry on, Temple of the Dog came out of the unfortunate passing of Wood. At the time Eddie Vedder was singing with a band down in San Diego called Bad Radio. They were very much progressive with a little funk sound which led to Eddie meeting drummer Jack Irons, who at the time was with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Since Irons had ties to the Seattle scene due to longtime friends, sometime in the late 80s he gave Vedder a demo tape of a band that was looking for a singer...that band eventually hired Vedder and became Pearl Jam. Irons would later (late 1994) play with Eddie in Pearl Jam after they called it quits with David Abbruzzese."
grunge,35m0fc,bradyarmobile,1 point,Thu May 14 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"Going along with time and place, only looking at the album covers or pictures of the band immediately makes me think of the Seattle area. But that's probably a bunch of personal growing up shit tied into it. Anyway its hard to imagine the Seattle scene as it is and was without them. The city it's self may have changed a lot, but the roots remain, and they go deep."

grunge,35m0fc,bradyarmobile,1 point,Mon May 11 20:58:16 2015 UTC,You should read 5 against 1: the Pearl Jam Story.  The first third of the book doesn't mention Vedder;  it follows Ament/Gossard moving to Seattle and all the interactions among the bands and personnel. Many of the lineups we know are that way because when grunge blew up that's who was playing with each other at the time. Very fluid scene.

So I'll shamelessly plug them here, and I do truly believe they're the best thing to come out of Seattle in the 90's. They get more songs played on the radio than any of the other bands because their albums are packed front to back with great songs."
grunge,35j0e1,nevosoinverno,3,Sun May 10 21:58:48 2015 UTC,which Alice in Chains album would you recommend i start with?
grunge,35j0e1,spacedog41,5,Sun May 10 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Some more selling points: When AiC did a special reunion concert for victims of a huge tsunami back in the early 2000s do you know who their main guest lead singer was? A Mr. Maynard James Keenan.   Every album of AiC has a different sound. In chronological order, Facelift sounds a lot like darker 80s metal, it in fact came out before Nirvana got big. Dirt is a super heavy and dark grind/doom metal approach to grunge, Sap is an acoustic experiment with beautiful deep songs and a few guest lead singers from Heart, Soundgarden, and Mudhoney. Jar of Flies is a more thought out acoustic/electric masterpiece, and is (I'm pretty sure it still holds the record) the highest selling E.P. (short album) of all time. Their self-titled, commonly called Tripod or the Dog album, is their most true grunge album and has a lot of inventive original sounds. Those are the albums with Layne, their two newest are Black Gives Way to Blue, which is a more mature dark and heavy album but isn't as chock-full of quality as the older albums, and The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, which includes songs that ANY Tool fan will love.  AiC is really your starting point. It's the most metal of the grunge bands (in my experience), it generally has an extremely heavy and dark atmosphere with amazing vocal work (even on the new stuff, Jerry is a god of harmony and songwriting) and has much less of the punk rock influence that most other grunge bands show.   I really didn't mean this to become a damn essay."
grunge,35j0e1,nevosoinverno,3,Sun May 10 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"If you are a fan of Tool, I would highly suggest their newest one, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. But all of their albums are very good. Jar of Flies / Sap if you like acoustic style work. Facelift and Dirt if you enjoy heavy riffs and grimy metal stuff. Their Self Titled and Black Gives Way to Blue are a mix of all 3."
grunge,35j0e1,eyecebrakr,5,Sun May 10 22:16:41 2015 UTC,"Alice in Chains is one of my all time favorite bands too, and I can confirm that these descriptions are accurate.... although I would never recommend starting off with their latest album.  I would start with what got them huge in Dirt and Jar of Flies."

grunge,35j0e1,inflated_waffles,3,Mon May 11 00:37:45 2015 UTC,I'd look into Mother Love Bone. By far my favorite band. Mike mccreedy is in MLB. I'd also suggest Mad Season which had members from Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam.

grunge,35j0e1,jacktheBOSS,2,Mon May 11 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"With Pearl Jam I'd start with Ten. It's an amazing album and definitely one of the best of all time. Its super easy to get into. Then move onto Vs (my favorite PJ album)another amazing album. Most would agree that Pearl Jam is at the top of their game between their first two albums. Check out their unplugged performance from 1992, along with the songs ""Yellow Ledbetter"" and ""Breath"". I'd suggest you listen to Vitalogy as well (it is a fantastic album despite the 4 filler songs)but its not as easy to get into compared to the first two. If you like Ten and Vs then definitely move onto Vitalogy and so on.  With Soundgarden, you have to start off with Superunknown. That album is just a fucking masterpiece; there isnt one bad song on it. Then move onto their vastly underated Down On The Upside. From there you should check out Bad Motorfinger. Those three albums feature Soundgardens' quintessential sound"
grunge,35j0e1,eyecebrakr,2,Sun May 10 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"Of course, you're still missing Nirvana, the band that inspired the genre's name. If you like heavier stuff, then start with Bleach; it's fantastic, but you may start with their Unplugged album too. All three of their studio albums are top notch. With that said, Soundgarden is my favorite grunge band. I really like Badmotorfinger and Down on the Upside by them."
grunge,35j0e1,constantstopper,3,Mon May 11 00:41:43 2015 UTC,Stone Temple Pilots. Purple is an outstanding album. Scott Weiland is probably the best vocalist of the 90's
grunge,35j0e1,MrBinns,1 point,Sun May 10 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"Hm, if you want to be a sort of experiment, start with  Flipper - Generic Flipper, and the Stooges - Fun House (not grunge but Flipper were proto-typical for cynical punk, and the Stooges, outdating punk by a decade, were just fucking fantastic)  Then move on to Sonic Youth - Daydream Nation, The Pixies - Doolittle, Surfa Rosa, Trompe le Monde  Probably Green River should be next, also Mother Love Bone  Then Alice In Chains - Facelift, but follow it with Nirvana - Bleach Then listen to Mudhoney - Superfuzz/bigmuff (my favorite album of the ""genre"")  Then go for AIC - Jar of Flies, Nirvana - Incesticide back to back with Nevermind. Then STP - Core. You'll pick out the big hooks and see how they're all sort of sonically related, but differently produced.   I'd throw Pearl Jam in here now, though Ten was around the time Nevermind was released, but they have a very different sound. Vs. is a great album, too, and will lead you right into the Soundgarden catalog, which is much more trippy and prog, but still in that base of Neil Young'ish Rock N' Roll.  Then on to newer stuff, which you're probably young enough to know way more about than I do.  Also, I know I'm leaving out a bunch of stuff, so just listen to everything, honestly. Having the internet is such a great resource for getting music and not having to go get judged by record store clerks for wanting to order a cassette of a 10 year old SST release. Hope you get into it, and remember, ""the look"" i.e. flannel and chucks is just bullshit. Just do what you want.  Edit: forgot Dinosaur Jr./anything j. mascis and folk implosion, also forgot the Meat Puppets and Vaselines. I'd fit them in the order around the flipper stage."

I don't think they had the front-back quality that the other albums had, but they were really good none-the-less.    Something else you have to remember, and please don't think I'm taking anything away from Layne, because I'm not, is that Layne was only 25% of the band.

I think back to when grunge was a thing people got overly concerned with a look that wasnt even supposed to be a look.  Same thing with punk.  Why do people have to latch on to things and make it fashionable?  can't people just dress how they stress without others assuming they are making a statement?  I think most of us just liked bands shirts and happened to have flannels and ripped up pants often from skateboarding too much.  Then they started selling pre-ripped pants and people bought the shit.  Stop making all forms of expression into consumerist hipster shit."

Same thing had just happened to my friend (that I'd rode to the concert with) and we were standing on the sidewalk out front when he recognized the drummer of Superdrag. He was a big fan so he starts talking to dude. He invites us on bus and we get drunk with Superdrag while other friend watches crappy Green Day show. I'm not sure if this is the craziest thing, but it's the best and most memorable."

They had rows of metal folding chairs set up, with security at the aisle intersections.  Prong opened, and the 2 guys in front of us got ejected for dancing into each other.  Rob & crew take the stage and play 2 while people try not to dance. Before the third, he says ""Wow.  This place sucks.  We won't be playing here again.  Try to have a good time."".  Halfway through the 3rd song, he stops and says ""We signed a contract saying we wouldn't start anything, so, yeah, but this...""  Just at that point, Security was running for the walls as the folding chairs began to groan.    I was pretty sure that the cops were going to shut it down, but they never did.  Great piles of folding chairs, and a few unseen folded ones on the floor for tripping upon.  Dangerous and amazing.  Rob was great.  Sean was a goddess."

Besides, you get a bigger variety of help over here. I consider myself a pretty harcore Grunge listener, but everything has its limits. I am sure I am not the only one that loves Grunge, but has some pet peeves. For example, I barely listen to Pearl Jam and I hate The Smashing Pumpkins, which some might not even consider Grunge. Grunge is in fact a pretty loose term. For example, I consider Local H to be a Grunge band and Dinosaur Jr is not Grunge enough for me. I am 100% sure that there are a lot of people around here who would disagree right away with me. Yet, I am a pretty seasoned listener. I listen to a solid variety of Grunge almost everyday. But do I, or anyone, represent a true ""Grunger""? No. My point is that you can't really choose a single person to do all the input for your interview, assuming that this interview has the purpose of exposing or informing about Grunge. It would be a lot easier for us, if you set up a number of questions for us to answer, and, hey, if you like what we are writing, reply with another question, directed to the specific user. If this is for your English class, get someone to dub our answers. Easy."

grunge,31yr9g,outer_fucking_space,2,Thu Apr 9 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, you need to realise that Mudhoney are not as underground as you think they are. They were as important, if not more, than the so called Big 4 bands. Throughout the years, they've consistently shown how prolific of a band they are, and just last year, they revived their spotlight with a commercial for the Infamous videogame. All this considered, you also need to realise that Mudhoney is a much more raw and punkish sound than any of the other Grunge bands you've listened so far. I still remember how I didn't care much about Mudhoney when I started listening to Grunge. They are not an easy listen like Nirvana or Pearl Jam. Even though Mudhoney kept defining Grunge, they had a very unique sound. Not only that, but Mark Arm is not a singer like Cornell or Vedder. He just screams/moans whatever the fuck he wants and he doesn't care if you think it is pretty or not.  I would recommend that you listen to March to Fuzz to get started. It probably includes most of the songs that you'll listen to and it is a good collection of what Mudhoney represents. You should also really listen to Rehab Doll/Dry as a Bone by Green River. It complements March to Fuzz really well, and it will help you understand what Mark Arm is all about. Anyhow, like some people already suggested, it's not a bad idea at all to let Mudhoney show themselves. Then again... I don't think any ""fan of the Seattle Sound"" should be missing the essential Mudhoney! Go listen to some Mudhoney!"

grunge,314is5,MrBinns,3,Thu Apr 2 00:53:34 2015 UTC,this guy biamps for sure. No way he could get that sound on a bass alone. that or his bass has an extended upper range that puts it into the guitar string range.  but biamping is the shit man! I want to biamp my guitar rig but idk if it would be worth it. It's kinda a bassist thing.

It's hard because while those bands were all labeled ""grunge"" they had pretty diverse sounds, except AiC and Soundgarden were both heavy as hell. So like, maybe the Space Needle with the SUBPOP logo worked into if? Troll doll wearing a flannel?

So grunge was my first musical love, and I got into it a couple of years past its prime, when it was basically on its last legs. I got into a few similar sounding bands around this time:   Local H For Squirrels (very sad story about what happened to this band, and it was a very important album for me. I tear up when I hear it.)   And I had a short and partially closeted hardcore punk phase, although I still love this album:   Refused   Then I got into stoner, doom and gothic stuff and its what I write and play myself now:   Kyuss Monster Magnet Boris Candlemass Scald Electric Wizard (one of the heaviest bands ever) Type O Negative Paradise Lost   And a lot of ""post-rock"", but most of all Pelican:   Pelican   More recently these have been on my playlist:   HAM Blood Ceremony Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats   But yeah, there might be a few things grunge fans like in that pile. I can give further recommendations if there's anything in particular that you like. Have fun!"

So, some time around 2010, probably 2007-08, I'm at Westfest on Division, in Chicago.. hanging out, drinking with my friends, most likely trying to talk to girls, sloppily, stupidly. My friends all go to get tacos or something and for some reason I end up just walking alone.   There's two stages, one at the east end of Division and one at the west end. I end up hearing something interesting coming from the west as I'm walking that direction, and eventually the music starts overpowering the music from the east stage.   I walk up on two dudes on a stage.. Local H just starting Fritz's Corner. They tear into it and that song hit me like a ton of bricks.

Today's post was this early version of what's probably their best-known song. Here's the backstory that came along with it:   Built on a chord shape lifted from Andy Summers and featuring a word borrowed from Velocity Girl, this early version of “Bound” isn’t quite there yet. It needs some tightening, and Joe Bosso, the consummate A&R man and an invaluable editor, will suggest losing the bridge. But the riff is there and the hook is hammered home like a sonofabitch.

I'm listening to music when ever i can so. but anyway there was a song with Alex using a flanger and it reminded me of some SG song. I guess that's the opposite of how it happened since rush was first but still. I would definitely say soundgarden has some psychedelic/progressive songs. Kim plays a guild guitar because he can make landscapey sounds by playing behind the bridge.   I was also going to make a ""What SG song has the best lyrics"" post because the imagery in Drawing flies reminded me of a darker King Crimson. Maybe I just like hard rock, punk rock, psychedelic, and progressive music and SG to me is the perfect combination of all of that.  As for why other people downvote songs that aren't strictly to whatever genre. It's probably because most people sub to listen to specifically listen to and talk about established bands in the genre. I know /r/music always has people complaining about other people just upvoting songs they know and downvoting stuff they haven't heard.

Thayil: Even before we slowed down and got more heavy and groove-oriented, we did stuff in weird time signatures. I don’t know how to describe it. Kinda like a Bauhaus-y-Gang of Four-Minute Men-ish-Big Boys amalgam. That was sort of before and up to Screaming Life. I mean you hear a little bit of that in “Hunted Down” or “Entering”—that sort of quirkiness or gothiness. But when we slowed down that quirkiness manifested itself in a sort of prog rock sort of quality. I remember when Badmotorfinger came out, and I remember Mark [Arm] from Mudhoney said, “Hey man, I just heard Badmotorfinger.” I’m all, “What do you think?” [Laughs] And he’s like, “Fuck, it sounds like Rush!”"

What I can add, is an agreement that Soundgarden definitely has a lot of outside influence in metal/progressive rock. I few months ago I took a headfirst dive into Progressive music: Cynic, Intervals, Tool, Dream Theater, Opeth and Pink Floyd and as someone who mainly listens to 90's ""grunge"" (predominately Pearl Jam), the band that bridged me from progressive to 90's hard rock again was Soundgarden and it's when I grew a much larger appreciation for their music."

Call it 25 years for easy math. Clearly I'm a little biased.   I think you are touching on some rather large issues in music today in general, but I'll try to stick with Soundgarden in particular.  A lot of the genres are getting extremely divisive right now. Music is splitting up into lots of smaller subs. Metal isn't metal anymore, there's 20 different types of metal.   I don't like to classify bands if I can help it. I don't like calling Soundgarden a grunge band, or a metal band. They're both, and more. Their sound can fall into about 15 different categories. Based on that, post it where ever you want. If it really doesn't fit, let the mods of that sub sort it out. If someone gets butthurt over it, fuck them. Seriously.   You should be posting whatever where it even kind of fits though - especially in the music subs. That's the whole point isn't it? To expose as many people to as much new music as possible? Maybe there's a 12 year old out there who's never heard LimoWreck, or No Attention or Mind Riot and gets blown away and suddenly there's a new Soundgarden fan.   Take a look at some of the more recent rock bands out here - like The Pretty Reckless. I'd call them more of a straight ahead rock band, but there's all sorts of influences in there. I can hear Soundgarden, Zepellin, Oasis etc etc. Are they rock? Hard rock? Post grunge? Yes. And it doesn't matter - she's got a great voice, writes mostly interesting lyrics and they happen to have a couple radio hits. Good for them.   Do I care what other people think of them? No. The only opinion that matters to me is mine. Fuck everybody else :)  I think that's the attitude we all should have about the music we listen to.

That's the beauty of this band to me. They are one band who have managed to grasp so many different sounds and styles and instead of people wanting to embrace that, they almost shun them for it. When I do post them to a diff subreddit I will include a tiny blurb where it points to how this band/song is relevant to the genre. Instead of people being interested, they look for me to exactly point out what song from SG sounds like <specific band from said genre>. Makes my fuckin eyes roll out of my head.

grunge,2zhkte,kiwikoi,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"Yep - Badmotorfinger was it. Buddy of mine brought it over one day and I heard Jesus Christ Pose and Rusty Cage and that was that. That album blew me away.   That summer was pretty crazy honestly. Ten came out in July? and then Nevermind...so the whole grunge craze was starting, and I was fully on board that train. And I love both those albums and listen to them on a fairly regular basis still for a lot of different reasons, but yeah, Badmotorfinger came out and it just...grabbed me like the rest of the stuff didn't.  On TPR - give it a try. I think she's got maybe the best female rock voice I've heard in a long long time. I do find their stuff a little hit and miss. I'm not skipping any songs on either album, but there are some tracks that are clearly better than others. I do think she tries a little too hard to be provocative, and I am not sure if that's just her being her or her being a 'rock and roll star'. Hard to tell. She's been pretty open and honest from what I've read etc, so maybe it's genuine. Whatever the case, it seems to be working. I think she's extremely talented though - she's 21? 22? Has 2 pretty solid albums under her belt already - so I'm looking forward to more stuff from them.   Never watched Gossip Girl so can't comment on that - didn't even know about that connection when I heard the first album so maybe that saved me from being too judgemental and/or dismissive.

Hear me out-   To quote Krist Novoselic ""Music is an art form that thrives on reinvention."" I remember seeing that at the EMP when I first got to Washington. Its a good mindset. You can't repeat the past.  Grunge as we knew it ""The Seattle Sound"" is dead. It didn't die with Kurt Cobain, it died with the media and probably somehow the internet, but that's a digression.  Walk around. Grunge is trendy. Youths are spending $800 for ripped jeans and an edgy graphic tee at urban outfitters. Alt music is the new pop music. Grunge, in the label it's in, is dead. Its a fashion accessory. It's a superiority complex. If you're looking for grunge the way it was, there will never be a genuine revival.  The idea of grunge is alive and thriving. Teens are still digging through thrift bins to be clothed, not kitschy. Freegans fucking exist, god bless em. At least three of my friends are in really shitty hardcore bands that play in this underpopulated garage. That's grunge, in my opinion. And it's booming in every other shitty rural town you can find. Its redefining itself every day with another shithead kid posting his staticy EP online, every bastard that hates the rat race they're headed towards and doesn't know where to store that anger at injustice.

Once after Pulp Fiction, and now again with the uprise of tons of Indie Bands using influences from the old Surf Rock and Garage Rock. It's not uncommon at all, as long as there is a cult following behind the scene. So, Grunge could potentially revive, in my opinion. Heck, we Grunge losers are more common than the Greasers who kept old school Rock N' Roll alive for all these years. There is no reason for Grunge not to revive. In fact for the last 6 years there has been an increased interest in Grunge. Even though Grunge has not  yet fully-revived, it has reappeared with new albums from Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, re-releases from Nirvana, Mad Season and others, very recent reunions like L7 or Babes in Toyland, and last but not least, some solid but obscure acts from Europe, like Japanese Voyeurs or The Chikitas. There are also notably popular bands like Drenge or Wavves, which are also Grunge, but with a prominent indie sound. They are pretty good, but not really the revival that most grungers are dying for. So, in short, I think if the right conditions are met, we could have a Grunge Revival coming up in the next 6 years."

grunge,2wbz1o,MeIohi,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:11:54 2015 UTC,True.  Kurt said himself the band started out as an indie rock band. Whether or not they released any of the music that was indie rock before they released bleach. I dunno.

grunge,2txsh6,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"Garbage (band):       Garbage is an alternative rock band formed in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1993.  The group consists of Scottish musician Shirley Manson (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and American musicians Duke Erikson (bass, guitar, keyboards), Steve Marker (guitar, keyboards), and Butch Vig (drums, percussion). All four members are involved in songwriting and production. The band have counted worldwide album sales of over 17 million units.   Garbage's debut album, Garbage, was critically acclaimed and an unexpected smash, selling over 4 million copies and certified double platinum in the UK, US, and Australia while accompanied by a string of increasingly successful singles in 1995–1996, including ""Stupid Girl"" and ""Only Happy When It Rains"".   Follow-up Version 2.0, released in 1998 after two years of production, had an equal commercial success, topping the UK Albums Chart and getting nominations for two Grammy Awards. Garbage followed this up by performing and co-producing the theme song to the nineteenth James Bond movie The World Is Not Enough.   Despite critical acclaim,  Garbage's 2001 third album Beautiful Garbage failed to match the commercial success achieved by its predecessors.  Garbage quietly disbanded amidst the troubled production of fourth album Bleed Like Me, but ultimately regrouped to complete the album, which was released in 2005 and peaked at a career-high No. 4 in the US.  The band cut short their concert tour in support of Bleed Like Me announcing an ""indefinite hiatus"",  emphasizing that they had not broken up, but wished to pursue personal interests.  The hiatus was briefly interrupted in 2007, as Garbage recorded new tracks for greatest hits retrospective Absolute Garbage.  Garbage ultimately regrouped in 2011, and released fifth album Not Your Kind of People in 2012 via the band's own independent label, Stunvolume Records.

People get off the most listening to musicians who dig the fuck out of what they're playing. That's the hook. Best of luck."

grunge,2qhf7r,yakeiram,6,Fri Dec 26 23:08:42 2014 UTC,"Good luck with the gig! Nirvana is my fav and I think that Kurt was an underrated guitarist. That being said, if you're a solid lead guitarist, you should have little trouble playing most of Nirvana's library, considering they were a three piece for most of their success. In my opinion, some great and easy tunes would be:  About A Girl  Very Ape  Polly (possibly the New Wave version, that's fast, fun and loud)  Sliver  On A Plain  Rape Me  Territorial Pissings (if you got the breath and pipes, haha)  Dive  Those are some of my favs and they are generally simple repetitive power chords. Lemme know whatchu think."
grunge,2qhf7r,GraveDohl,3,Fri Dec 26 23:30:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for these! i don't actually know all of them, I'd love to do Territorial Pissings though and I can pull off the screaming.  I've always wanted to do Rape Me but as a girl I feel like that would be taken the wrong way, haha."
grunge,2qhf7r,GraveDohl,2,Fri Dec 26 23:44:20 2014 UTC,"Oh cool! You should totally sing Territorial Pissings, it'll be awesome. Yeah, if you're uncomfortable with Rape Me, I totally get it. Pair Territorial Pissings with this and you'll be gold, I think."
grunge,2qhf7r,MrBinns,2,Sat Dec 27 00:47:47 2014 UTC,"idk how much you can learn in a few days especially with singing. maybe i'm just a slow noob. HEre is some I can 'sing' with while playing. I'm not a singer though. have you tried recuiting someone to stand in for your guitarist?  nirvana has a lot obviously. Aneurysm, Lithium, something in the way. The unplugged stuff is pretty easy and it's all tuned to eb(i think)  soundgarden: rustycage(drop b), outshined(drop d), fell on black days  STP: plush   TotD: Hungerstrike if you have another singer. the guitar part is very easy and only two parts, but the singing comes in at odd times.  Pearl Jam: maybe rearview mirror. why go, for the solo just stick to e minor pent. you can get alive to sound good with only one guitar, but idk about singing also. Black is easy. It's E Maj and A Maj barre chord for the into. then moves to C Maj and Em open chords. A d Maj open comes in at some point. You can add the d on the 2string 3fret for the CMa and Em to 'spice it up'  Mother Love Bone: Stargazer. For the into you can strum the chords and play the end of the end lead parts. Then back to strumming. break it in half and play each part. turn on a chorus for the prechorus part right before ""stargazer you call the shots"""
grunge,2qhf7r,MrBinns,3,Fri Dec 26 23:45:54 2014 UTC,"This is an awesome list!  yeah it will definitely be a struggle to learn them all in a few days. Why Go is a great one, I didn't think of it before but I'll almost definitely do that one!"

grunge,2pnpfn,MrBinns,7,Thu Dec 18 06:01:29 2014 UTC,I think DAVE GROHL knows he's a better drummer than singer/guitarist. He hasn't exactly stopped playing drums.
grunge,2pnpfn,CaptainDefect,3,Thu Dec 18 10:34:12 2014 UTC,"Dave Grohl was better in Nirvana than the Foo Fighters. It's just not progressive anymore, Nirvana was something new and exciting, Foo Fighters just seem like any other rock band these days."
grunge,2pnpfn,LunchpaiI,2,Thu Dec 18 16:29:46 2014 UTC,The Foo Fighters have always sounded painfully generic to me.  But I've seen a lot of people say they prefer the Foo Fighters to Nirvana.
grunge,2pnpfn,CaptainDefect,2,Thu Dec 18 18:38:57 2014 UTC,"Seeing people say Dave has a ""golden voice"" in his AMA was pretty painful. His voice is nothing compared to Kurt's. I can appreciate his music, but I don't think they can ever really compare in my mind."

grunge,2pmdcw,DanConnersGarage,3,Thu Dec 18 04:23:08 2014 UTC,Honestly I can't recommend anything less than the entire discographies of the big 4. Each band evolves over time so you should listen to them all to find out which ones you like the best.   Or if you are like me you'll like every single one.
grunge,2pmdcw,MrBinns,3,Mon Dec 22 07:35:06 2014 UTC,all of them  .  .  .  because they are vastly different from each other
grunge,2pmdcw,-SpittingVenom-,2,Thu Dec 18 04:54:53 2014 UTC,Green River - Dry as a Bone/Rehab Doll Soundgarden - Badmotorfinger Nirvana - Bleach Temple of the Dog - Temple of the Dog
grunge,2pmdcw,lovemeorrageme,2,Wed Dec 17 22:35:47 2014 UTC,"You should give a listen to one or two from most of the bands to get a taste, cause grunge is general, there still exists different sounds within the genre. Also, explore this sub a little because it's a great place for variety with a great collection of popular and maybe even unheard of songs by the popular or maybe even unheard of grunge bands. Then, if you want to focus more on one band or one specific style from the era, check out the subs linked in the sidebar. All of them are great communities like this one that are all there for the same reason.  I like pretty much all music from that era, and Soundgarden is my favorite band...So with much bias I'm gonna recommend every Soundgarden album. 'Down on the Upside' is my personal favorite (although sometimes you might hear people say it's their worst album, opinion thing I guess). Other than SG, though, I highly recommend Temple of the Dog's self-titled album, as well as 'Sweet Oblivion'-Screaming Trees (one of my all time favorite albums, absolutely amazing). So explore around a bit, and visit the general subs as well as the focused subs for a little bit of everything."

I really like how he was such a fan of music. He was so immersed in being a fan that when he created songs he was acutely aware of their influence. For instance, Kurt had stated the song You Know You're Right was a perfect Alice in Chains song. I love that about him, because he is right when you think about it. I'd really love to get into a dimension machine and get to see the Pixies play Smells Like Teen Spirit, or hear the Melvins play anything (other than Love Buzz of course) off Bleach.... Or better yet, The Beatles play About A Girl.."

What seems like a 90's heavy rock revival is what Cube offer, are we're loving it.

There are pictures of Sub Pop parties where Soundgarden was there, well after they had moved on to A&M.

grunge,2jc5n0,LunchpaiI,22,Wed Oct 15 17:52:12 2014 UTC,"Well the band had existed for years and released several albums before the term ""grunge"" came into existence.   They started as a metal band. Period. That is what they always identified with, and if you were watching Headbanger's Ball play Man In The Box in 1990 before Nevermind and Ten were released and nobody was using the term ""grunge"" yet--they were just considered another metal band.   I'll reiterate what I've often said about this subject: ""Grunge"" is not a sound, it was a scene. The term was primarily used to describe a diverse group of musicians who shared a common cultural/musical background  in a specific region but also had diverse styles and influences. You cannot define a band as ""grunge"" by how they sounded--otherwise you could not lump Pearl Jam and The Melvins in the same category even though they are both widely acknowledged as some of the titans of the grunge scene.   Bands like Soundgarden, AIC, The Melvins, and others came from a primarily metal influence/background. AIC and Soundgarden even had borderline ""glam""  style in their early years, and certainly took a lot of influence from the spectrum of the metal community from Sabbath to Maiden, etc.  Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, and Nirvana came from a more traditional ""classic rock"" background that was tempered with a punk edge that was seemingly intent on rebelling against the ""glam"" hair metal of the era. Their biggest influences were Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Hendrix, The Ramones, The Pixies, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Neil Young, Dead Kennedys, etc. They all evolved together, developed their unique styles,  and coexisted peacefully despite their differences and that is why the grunge scene was such a remarkable thing. It was because it fomented inside  of an insular community that united across the stylistic and creative divides that normally separate musicians--it is rare for the punks and the metalheads to get along and collaborate and they typically had very separate ""scenes"" going on simultaneously, but in the Seattle area they actually bonded together (of course, with some exceptions of interpersonal rivalry).   So yeah, tl;dr short answer: They are both"
grunge,2jc5n0,night_owl,4,Wed Oct 15 21:36:20 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure the screaming trees first met soundgarden by going to their show to heckle their sludge metal sound. They ended up liking it; I guess they became friends or whatnot.
grunge,2jc5n0,MrBinns,2,Thu Oct 16 01:38:31 2014 UTC,AIC was a glam rock band to begin with. There's a video with them on YouTube about 2-3 years before Facelift made its debut they looked glam rock as shit especially Layne and Mike. But fast forward about 7-8 years later and you see them on the unplugged concert it's like viewing a whole different band. Physically speaking.

grunge,2izhdc,fff8e7cosmic,5,Sun Oct 12 17:06:39 2014 UTC,"I have a theory on this.  The False Nostalgia of the Nineties.  I'm sixteen, born in 1998. Can I remember the nineties? Fuck no, I was an infant. Chances are, anyone from 14 to 19 don't really remember the nineties, and if they do, it's bits and pieces. But right now, that age group is the target demographic for most fashion industries.  But if you ask anyone around that age about any distinctively nineties trend, they'll talk about how totally nostalgic they are about it. And maybe they are genuinely nostalgic, but chances are, they have a thin memory of it at best.  Now, every generation is full of pretentious fuckers who think the decade during their prime is the greatest. That's just how it is. But the nineties weren't the decade of my generation. Hell, they weren't our decade in anything but technicalities.  So what's the cause for the ""nostalgia""? The internet.   We all know common useage internet is only a recent thing. On the internet, everyone can talk about something, and everyone can see it. And when an eight year old on the internet in the early 2000's sees twenty year old's recounting the grandeur of the nineties, they want to feel like they're a part of it. And can claim they were because, technically, they were.  But now, everyone's kind of in denial in realizing that our generation isn't the nineties. So we ""bring it back"" out of ""nostalgia"". Which is somewhere between a misguided attempt at being a part of something, and resentfulness at how the nineties popularized being alternative; which made trying to rebellion or having definable social cliques completely null.  Does the 2010's have it's own fashions? Yes. But the more we get in, the more we're taking from the past. Flower crowns, those atrocious windbreakers, winged eyeliner, mod style. The ""hipster"" style is a bit of an advent, but even that is rooted in vintage looks.   This all to say grunge isn't a movement or a statement to the masses. It's a fashion statement."
grunge,2izhdc,lightfive,2,Sun Oct 12 02:15:39 2014 UTC,"Thing that really doesn't sit well with me is that grunge was an anti-style. Grunge went against the norm of fashion and music. It was scruffy, dirty and grungey. The movement has become one of the very things it was rebelling against. Mainstream and fashionable."
grunge,2izhdc,oddbuttons,3,Sun Oct 12 02:28:00 2014 UTC,"I can't find it with a google, but I think there's some Kurt Cobain quote out there about how he started to hate Nirvana, because the kind of people who used to pick on him were going to the shows and loving the band.   The grunge movement had some fantastic effects, but it made alternative mainstream, and I don't think that can be undone."
grunge,2izhdc,fff8e7cosmic,5,Sun Oct 12 02:35:29 2014 UTC,"If you read his suicide note, One of the reasons Kurt killed himself was his fame. He hated how famous he had become."
grunge,2izhdc,fff8e7cosmic,1 point,Sun Oct 12 02:55:36 2014 UTC,"That was never implicit or explicit in his note. He said he had lost his passion for making music. He was 10x more famous in late 91 early 92 than he was in 1994, his suicide I think was purely caused by his manic depression and drug use."

Can't find the exact quote either but he said that in Come as you are. He also stated that they fucked up shows around 1991-92ish on purpose to get rid of mainstream fans."
grunge,2izhdc,Dr_Turkey,2,Sun Oct 12 16:56:32 2014 UTC,"Perhaps the initial wearers were poor and threw it together, but once it became known by a cultural term, 90s grunge was a fashion statement. ""Look at how hard I'm not trying"" is still trying.   People searched for plaids they liked, usually ones that were long, fit as desired, had pockets a person liked, etc. Ones from mall department stores were definitely considered dorky and off the mark in my area. New jeans and shoes were often aggressively abused to look worn before they were presentable for school.   I was 10 in 1991, so I remember it all. There were great things about the time but kids/teens were what they always are: cliquey, scared, passionate, argumentative, copycats. There was a fairly strong hippie and goth resurgence in the 90s as well."

The beginning riff is really, really close to Heart-Shaped box's, and the flannel + Kurt haircut, similar music video style (the effects and idea with the mask theme are unique, but you can pretty easily see similarities with Kurt's mannerisms) and Fender Jaguar makes it a little less than original. There's nothing wrong with taking ideas and chord progressions and making them your own but I feel like these guys would be much better as a cover band, the frontman is a near flawless Kurt, which I do think is pretty cool, but I don't really think it works when you're making your own music, it just made me feel like I should go and listen to In Utero to be honest."

grunge,2ggb8w,RedBeardofDoom,0,Mon Sep 15 21:03:50 2014 UTC,"not Smashing Pumpkins  I no this is a controversial topic here, but I'm pretty firm on this. Take a listen to a bit of Gish, which came out only a few months before Badmotorfinger, Ten, and Nevermind. I am just not hearing the angry convergence of metal and punk that defines the rest of the grunge scene.  (For the record, Gish gets just as much love and spins in my collection, I just don't consider them grunge at all).   Afghan Whigs are another that I normally wouldn't include, but they are a little closer--they were on Sub Pop after all. I think Afghan Whigs, Meat Puppets, and The Pixies had a big impact on the scene, but the came a little early and were peripheral to the grunge scene which was almost exclusively in the pacific NW--sort of proto-grunge, like the way The Stooges and MC5 paved the way for the birth of punk, but weren't really considered punk bands themselves.   I know some people complain that this strictly confines grunge to a small scene, but that is really how it was, and part of why it didn't endure--it was a scene, not a genre, and it was fated to only exist for a finite window of time."
grunge,2ggb8w,echoswolf,2,Mon Sep 15 21:18:09 2014 UTC,"I agree to an extent.  I think for a lot of people 'grunge' means 'alternative bands from the nineties'.  I will always mention bands like Pumpkins, Tool and Faith no More when I have a conversation about grunge because they were bands I got into at the same time that grunge was having an impact on the music scene, but I don't really consider them to be grunge."

One of my favorite songs of theirs (saw them play it live about 6 months ago), but I've never thought of it as grunge at all--far from it. It's essentially a countrified folk rock song. Not even close to grunge at all--it's closer to Americana than grunge.    It just doesn't have the grimey, rough, angry, angsty convergence of metal and punk to it that  is the essence of grunge.   If I had to pick a single song to define grunge, it would probably have to come from Dirt, Badmotorfinger, or Bleach."

grunge,2en09q,GoChiefs,8,Tue Aug 26 18:05:30 2014 UTC,I cannot fully express the mixed emotions. The new stuff from Alice in Chains is great. I've seen them live twice and I am so pleased to hear them sing the older stuff too.  Sometimes I wish they weren't Alice in Chains but a different band with a different name. That way William DuVall could rock it without the unfair comparisons to Layne Staley. Layne was a legend with a voice that can't be compared. William is great and that should be enough.
grunge,2en09q,GenestealerUK,4,Tue Aug 26 19:35:14 2014 UTC,"he is not Layne but there will never be singer like him again so i think it could be far worse i think that he gets more hate that he really deserve he is not bad singer his voice is just different and people kinda cant reconcile with that and with the fact that Layne is gone. I like the new Alice in Chains especially the new album tracks like Stone,Voices,and Devil put ...are really great mainly The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here has that old AiC feeling in it :) i dont fancy the first new AiC album though maybe just because in time the album came out i was still pissed off they making new AiC album without Layne :P but Check my Brain is great track i like this one i think that AiC and especially Jerry has lot of to give and Duvall is better and better i think the fans will start to like him by the time.Peace ... :))"
grunge,2en09q,LordAlphonse16,3,Tue Aug 26 18:13:20 2014 UTC,"I think he rocks.  I think it works because he doesn't just try and ape Layne, he has his own voice.  If they'd got a Layne soundalike I don't think fans would have bought it.  Then again, it worked for AC/DC, I suppose...  EDIT - check out William's previous band, Comes With the Fall.  That's good shit right there."
grunge,2en09q,RedBeardofDoom,3,Tue Aug 26 18:16:50 2014 UTC,I think he is doing a great job in a tough situation.  Layne is not coming back.  I want to hear more AiC.  It all works out in my book.
grunge,2en09q,AshleyBlackhorse,2,Tue Aug 26 22:59:12 2014 UTC,"I still feel Maynard James Keenan would have been a perfect choice.  I'm not a fan of the modern AiC material, but also wasn't much of a fan of Jerry's solo work either. So I think it's less to do with William and more to do with Jerry just changing after the original AiC broke up."
grunge,2en09q,Highw4ySt4r,2,Wed Aug 27 00:04:56 2014 UTC,"I think that it's good music that he's making, but I think it's disrespectful to Layne to have used the Alice in Chains name after his death. I like new AiC but Layne was way better."
grunge,2en09q,gmartin613,1 point,Thu Aug 28 18:38:04 2014 UTC,"He does a great job being a 2nd vocalist and providing a somewhat close impersonation on older songs. The only issue I have is that in the mix William is always really quiet in comparison to Jerry now, or they seem to really like sounding similar in the studio. Live they're more distinguishable, but the mix is a bit muddied still for some of the DuVall records.  Love them still, glad that AiC still continue like Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, etc."

I love Smashing Pumpkins and think Billy Corgan is a brilliant songwriter - the best SP songs wouldn't be the same if Billy had not been such a control freak - but look at SP now. It's just Billy remaining and a bunch of new musicians he's had to bring on board. I much prefer Soundgarden's songwriting process, where it's much more of a collaborative team effort, and the burden of producing songs is not just on one or even two members. With all the members of Soundgarden working together to produce music they think kicks ass, they have a good idea that there fans will also enjoy it.  I'm eagerly awaiting new albums from both SP and SG.."

grunge,2brtvn,MrBinns,10,Sat Jul 26 19:57:26 2014 UTC,"Screaming Trees, you might already listen to them but you didn't mention them. Absolutely fantastic band from the classic 90's era.   Eyes Adrift weren't grunge exactly but that album is so vastly underated, Krist Novocelic was in them if you didn't already know, so was Kirk from the Meat Puppets.   Meat Puppets also since I just metioned them, some of their stuff would appeal to fans of grunge for sure and they've got a large back catalogue.   Those three would appeal to your first preferance I think.  The Cows - awesome awesome band, noise rock i guess but would appeal to fans of grunge, especially since you like the Melvins. Cunning Stunts would be a good starting point.  If you like Tad, Melvins and that nois rocky, Bleach, type grunge sound them check out the stuff that was on Amphetamine Reptile Records in the 80's and 90's."

From Can Through String was a classic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1DqP1Moae4  Although they moved far away from this in later albums, the first two Everclear albums are grunge classics.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSHQmKXeaJc&list=PL3083D76081E9ECF1  While more of a bay area punk band, Jawbreaker incorporated a lot of grunge elements into their music.  Bivouac was pretty much a grunge record and is massive.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUTNCHil68s    If you like Jawbreaker, there's some other great bands like Samiam and Knapsack that were in the same vein and definitely relate to cleaner grunge bands.  One of the biggest influences on grunge was a band called the Wipers.  Nirvana was fond of covering them (both ""Return of the Rat"" and ""d7"") https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTqUoSF8mJA"

They've moved into more of an indie rock band over their career and they are definitely a ""softer"" band compared to a lot of the stuff in the genre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Ke7Sd2qgc  The Future Now has a little of that toadies vibe, very grungy: http://thefuturenow.bandcamp.com/  If there's anything in either of these that interests you, let me know and I can get you more in that direction."

It was dumb, but fun.  That looks like what you have here.  The font for 'farmlands' is atrocious. I don't hate the rest, but I certainly don't like it a lot. There are plenty of design subreddits that would be keen to help you out. If not, give fiver a go.  If all else fails, I could help out. At least, I'd like to help with a band logo.  Edit: found the generator - http://thesurrealist.co.uk/album.php  Edit 2: just listened to the tracks. Sounds very Gish-era Pumpkins slash AIC - which I love. Kudos.  I really hope these aren't final mixes. You could use a second guitar track to really beef up the guitar sound. It lacks at times, but at other times, the stark loneliness of the guitar is wonderful.  You guys look young which means there's plenty of time for your sound to mature.

See i really like the kind of amateur / cheesy look of the Farmland font. I think that handwriten kind of style was very prevalant a couple decades ago. Kind of adds some charm to it. I want it to be kind of crazy and off the walls with some amateurish charm.. after all there is virtually no budget for the art or the printing.

It's definitely one of a kind and is so much different from anything they ever did later on.   EDIT:  Interesting fact from the article:   Alexakis used a beat-up Guild Bluesbird guitar to perform the album. For an amp, Alexakis used a Fender Super Twin with a blown 6L6 tube that would squeal every time Art hit a chord. Often, the amp would overheat and start smoking. When that happened, they would put icepacks on the back and let it cool down, then get back to recording the demo. Despite the problems, Alexakis' amp ended up giving the album a uniquely raucous, noisy sound."

I think ElasticDawg's comments in that Flaming Lips discussion are pretty apt, in that they qualify by the earlier definition, but not the later one.  I felt like the Cobain connection made it worth posting here either way, though."
grunge,2a18u0,Shogun102000,0,Tue Jul 8 00:34:39 2014 UTC,I wouldn't even say sound or scene. This song has a mandolin in it for Kurt's sake.

Yes, he wrote amazing songs about suffering.  Dirt is like a heroin concept album.  (I've got 3 yrs+ clean from heroin myself).  I can't think of another artist, besides perhaps Trent Reznor, who excels at painting that dark image of life, angst and pain.  But you can't do it forever.  Artists need to evolve to survive.  Layne was never stopping heroin.  He was never going to stop writing songs about the inner turmoil he suffered from.  Unfortunately, the way it played out was an eventuality and everyone knew it.  My only thing:  Perhaps Jerry should have released those albums as solo albums.  Just a thought.  But if Sublime can carry on...well, nothing surprises me anymore..."

And they are amazing musicians with all the grunge pedigree (Green River and MLB) anyone could ask for.  McReady is an amazing guitarist and Matt Cameron plays drums in PJ and fucking Soundgarden.  So you know he's doing something right.  But when Kurt came along in the late 80's and certainly after Nevermind he smashed all the faggy LA hair band bullshit.  Pretentious Ballad-Metal (BLAH).  He proved that you didn't need a $10000 guitar or 20 years of lessons.  That passion and real emotion were enough.  This, to me is the foundation of grunge.  The manifesto.  And Pearl Jam, just don't have it.  Even when they took on Ticketmaster in the 90's if felt forced.  But that's only my opinion.  Have a great weekend everyone!"

Also, most rock musicians want to be rock stars, so I am not sure why she thinks this is an important thing.  He probably wanted to be successful, but did he want to be the most famous person in music? Maybe not.  I mean, he was an amazing and authentic artist who was very conflicted about success and whether or not that would change him into something he hated.

grunge,28fhym,night_owl,3,Wed Jun 18 06:09:48 2014 UTC,"I think the term grunge is and should be used pretty loosely in this sub. What bands are grunge is not clear cut and there is always room for debate, so I think any band with a 90's alternative sound that is similar to what most people call grunge is acceptable."
grunge,28fhym,Chunibrow,1 point,Wed Jun 18 16:03:19 2014 UTC,"They don't sound ""grunge"" and they came from a totally different background.   The only thing it has to associate with the grunge scene is it was released the same year as Nevermind and Ten. Grunge is a pretty narrowly defined term, and although it means the sub isn't overflowing with content, I'm okay with that for the sake of accuracy.    I think any band with a 90's alternative sound that is similar to what most people call grunge is acceptable.   so this sub should be about Bush, Radiohead, Collective Soul, RHCP, Weezer, etc?  They have a /r/90salternative and /r/alternativerock, might as well just merge them all together then....If we blur the lines that loosely then there is really no point in having separate subs--maybe just put it all in /r/music."
grunge,28fhym,night_owl,1 point,Wed Jun 18 18:05:51 2014 UTC,"It was also produced by butch vig and they had a huge fan base overlap with Seattle bands, if we're playing this game.   Far from being narrowly defined, grunge is literally not defined at all. Is Pearl Jam grunge? Many say yes, many say no. Is AIC grunge? They'd be the first to say they're not. And yet those are 2 of the Holy Quartet of grunge bands.   As to your other point, you're correct that all 90s alternative bands shouldn't be considered grunge, and I wouldn't want to see rhcp or ratm here. But Bush or silver chair... Eh. For me it's grungy enough I'd take it. I mean they sound so much like grunge it's no different than people putting videos of their friends current band that sounds grungy and videos like that get posted all the time. I guess it just comes down to personal preference. Me, I'd like to be more lenient in order to be exposed to more music on this sub, rather than keep it ""pure"" with a strict set of arbitrary rules and have nothing but the same bands recycled over and over"

Don't get me wrong, I think Gish is one of the best albums of the entire decade, but it really bothers that some people consider anything with guitars that came about between 1991-1995 as ""grunge"".

The band name is taken from the novel Brighton Rock by Graham Greene. The band is often credited with initiating a new wave of shoegaze, sometimes referred to as NuGaze, which bears comparison to bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive.  The band currently comprises Som Wardner (vocals, guitar, piano and lyrics), Ravi Kesavaram (drums) and Tatia Starkey (bass) (daughter of Zak Starkey, and granddaughter of Ringo Starr of The Beatles). The band had success in the early millennium with three Top 40 hit singles in the UK Singles Chart and a UK Top 40 album,  before announcing a hiatus at the height of their success. The group released new material in 2007, and will finally release their second album in 2014.

grunge,27cqbq,Vesploogie,2,Thu Jun 5 06:24:33 2014 UTC,"Houdini was the album that got me into them, but my favorite has to be A Senile Animal. Every single song is just a powerhouse of sound from every instrument. Prick was a bit too experimental and 'out there' for me. I group that one with Honky, which actually frightened me the first time I listened to it. But I guess that's just part of what makes Melvins such a great band; even more so with Tres Cabrones being a great album after 30 years of doing what they do."
grunge,27cqbq,Vesploogie,2,Thu Jun 5 06:23:51 2014 UTC,"A Senile Animal was the album that re-ignited my love of The Melvins. I'd actually kinda stopped following them and hadn't really been listening to them very much until I got a copy of that album and it stayed in heavy rotation for a long time and encouraged me to listen to more and more of their records from all eras. Civilized Worm is probably my favorite track from their entire catalog.   I've seen them live a few times over the last few years and I'm continually amazed at how they can re-invent themselves and keep doing new and interesting things without really abandoning what i like about them. They are always bringing in new collaborators and their flexible lineup means you never get bored with their tours because each one is a totally difference (like having Trevor Dunn playing stand-up bass). I'm seeing Buzz doing a solo acoustic show at a bar near my house in a couple weeks, really excited to see a stripped-down version of their music!"

grunge,26bugd,0JRB19690,3,Sat May 24 00:23:58 2014 UTC,My mate made a pretty insightful comment when I first let him hear this band. He noticed how this album is the perfect example of the turning point between glam rock and grunge. The way in which the obviously hair metal leanings are trimmed back a little and you can hear the grunge coming through. Obviously that's ignoring the proto-grunge movement with bands like Dino Jr and the like who already had a grunge sound down but he made a pretty good point. Early Alice in Chains is another good example of that I think.

grunge,24wkq6,mrndizzle,3,Tue May 6 22:53:30 2014 UTC,"The first 6 songs are all amazing.  Swing on This is kind of a goof off for my tastes that I forget exists most of the time, but it doesn't tarnish the record much like any of the sillier tracks on Physical Graffiti or something.  Whale & Wasp is so incredibly gorgeous with that layered guitar tone and then you have this melancholy acoustic melody layered with the ""otherworldly guitar bends"" that breaks into a sentimental, almost hopeful chorus of sorts, before falling back into despair.  But it's all so beautiful that it can't make you sad.  At the end of the day, that's what AIC did.  Whenever I'm really frustrated, there's nothing better than this band. But that song tells such a fucking story for having no lyrics.  It's the funeral dirge for Layne, 8 years before he would die, and he had no part in writing it.    As far as sensitive metal instrumentals go, a good comparison would be Bron-yr-Aur from the aforementioned Zep album.  That one is also beautiful and it lets you feel the sun on your face, bouncing off blades of grass at Headley Grange in some middle earthy world conjured in Jimmy Page's mind, but it doesn't nearly have as much implicit beauty in the words it doesn't say.  And Whale & Wasp is a song that relatively few grunge fans have bothered to listen to more than once or twice, probably writing it off as that curious instrumental towards the end of Jar of Flies."

They were good bands.  I think Puddle of Mudd sounds more like Nirvana. Lead singer has a Kurt-esque voice on many songs."
grunge,24wkq6,Chunibrow,6,Wed May 7 03:08:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah Godsmack's first album is excellent.   I've always found PoM music to be very AIC influenced, but the singer tries to sound like Kurt."

In the 80s, we were listening to hair metal bands, with songs about getting laid and partying, complete with screechy chromatic guitar solos.  The grunge bands came along with a heavier, more bare bones, less produced sound.  The guitars sounded totally different to me.  I remember specifically that Cantrell's ""bendy"" guitar sound blew me away.  And the lyrics weren't about chasing tail and getting drunk, they seemed much darker and more meaningful.  At least that's how it felt to me at first.  Later on it became more of a scene, with the clothing and derivative bands like STP popping up."

That's not a catch all either though, there is a grunge sound, and Stone Temple Pilot's 'Core' is a great example of what you listed, despite the band originating from California. It depends on how you define Grunge, but it's a loose term and the fact that grunge was deemed to have died on Kurt Cobain's death leads me to believe that the term can mean quite a few things to quite a few people, none of them wrong."
grunge,240u6r,KittyMulcher,6,Sat Apr 26 11:03:23 2014 UTC,"They don't sound post grunge, post grunge emulated Vedder's sound."
grunge,240u6r,Epithemus,5,Sat Apr 26 12:38:39 2014 UTC,"Depends on your definition of grunge.  I don't think grunge is outright definable.  Different people have different ideas.  But if you've only heard Pearl Jam's singles then you won't have noted that they do have:   heavy guitar distortion punk influence *occasional acoustic songwriting   I don't know how to define grunge but I feel it was just as much a scene as it was a sound (and let's face it, none of the big guys sound particularly alike).  They were all friends, all doing the rounds at the same time, all came up together, etc.  That's what makes PJ a grunge band if nothing else, their history of Mother Love Bone, Malfunkshun, etc.  Have a listen to Spin the Black Circle, Blood, Brain of J, Animal, Go to name but a few.  They might show you a side you haven't heard before.  Whether they will then fall into your definition of grunge I don't know, but they certainly fall into mine."
grunge,240u6r,RedBeardofDoom,5,Sat Apr 26 10:57:26 2014 UTC,"I think /u/KittyMulcher has given the best answer there. Even though grunge seems to have sort of a particular sound, it's more of a music scene from Seattle that came out in the 90s. But still, I think I know what you mean and it's probably because you just haven't heard of Pearl Jam's heaviest songs. As much as they have a smoother sound, they can still rock the shit out of a song.   Try Blood, Not For You, Do The Evolution, Comatose, State of Love and Trust"
grunge,240u6r,Marcalogy,4,Sat Apr 26 16:07:45 2014 UTC,"Grunge was a scene not a genre, Pearl Jam was in Seattle in the early 90's so were Tad and Mudhoney they're all Grunge"
grunge,240u6r,rideaspiral,4,Sat Apr 26 16:42:43 2014 UTC,"Want to echo all the comments here saying it was a scene, not a genre.  I think it's important to note as well that by the time Nirvana broke and grunge went global the scene was effectively over.  The early 90's stuff by the big grunge bands, I would argue, are the end of ""grunge"".    To Pearl Jam specifically, I think Ten is very clearly a grunge album.  There you have Vedder joining a group of guys that had been playing with each other in different bands for some time.  Eddie adds vocals, but doesn't influence the style of the band much.  What you hear moving forward is Eddie taking on a bigger writing role with each record."
grunge,240u6r,theGuatemalanYMCA,1 point,Sat Apr 26 18:12:29 2014 UTC,"they were just a part of the scene back in the glory days. as far as sound goes all those bands have extremely different styles. Nirvana is Pop/Punk Rock, Alice in Chains is definitely the heaviest thing coming out at the time more like Hard Heavy Rock, and Pearl Jam is just a great jam band. Lots of progressions and repeating licks it's more of a vibe they get with their sound that is so nostalgic"

grunge,240u6r,DrunkenGerbils,1 point,Mon Apr 28 21:32:07 2014 UTC,"There first two albums, Ten and Vs. are very distortion heavy and guitar driven with strong punk influences. The first song on Vs. called GO is a great example of that. They still have a strong punk influence till this day, the second track on there new album Lightning Bolt called Mind Your Manners is good example of this.   Pearl Jam is actually very similar to Nirvana (my personal favorite). Both bands are known more for there more melodic tracks but when you really dive into there catalog you find a lot of punk rock influence and heavily distorted guitar driven songs. Neither Pearl Jam or Nirvana's ""style"" can be summed up in one word or defined by any one of there albums alone. Even Kurt said when he was alive that Grunge was a made up word that was created by the media to sell more magazines. When asked what kind of band Nirvana was he said ""just a rock band"". Simple as that, so yeah you could say Pearl Jam is ""just a rock band"", and I bet they'd tend to agree with you.

""isn't that what grunge is all about? Aggression, loudness, smashing guitars?""  Not necessarily.  ""I'm mostly drawing these ideas from the two grunge bands that I've properly listened to - Nirvana and Mudhoney.""  So you don't really know what you're talking about having only 'properly' listened to Nirvana and Mudhoney.  ""to me Pearl Jam are weak, bland and just a 'rock' band. In fact, they sound more like post-grunge than grunge.""  Don't know what you're talking about and calling out one of the bigger bands associated with the genre?  I smell troll.

You're definitely showing your 90s grunge influence, too.  I was sort of expecting that the sound would somehow become bigger at 0:50, though. Maybe it's a good idea to do something there like throw some more distortion on the bass, double-track it, or double it with a guitar? Just an idea.  Oh yeah, and the bitcrushed stuff in the background at some point seems a bit gratuitous. It doesn't quite fit the production style, I think."

It'd be a stretch to categorize Beat Happening as grunge but this song in particular has an experimental fuzz to it that reminds me of some quieter Sonic Youth.  Check out /r/lofi for more quasi-grunge and /r/cassetteculture for all the tape hiss you can handle."
