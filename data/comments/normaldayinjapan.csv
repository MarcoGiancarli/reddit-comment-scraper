normaldayinjapan,3dx76c,RegentYeti,2,Mon Jul 20 08:39:42 2015 UTC,Doubtful. Either based off of this: http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/06/25/zoo-reports-increase-in-visitors-as-japans-women-fall-for-this-handsome-gorilla%E3%80%90photos%E3%80%91/  Or born from a similar cultural attitude.

normaldayinjapan,3dx76c,devcoder,2,Mon Jul 20 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"I was going to ask a similar question. Japanese culture is known for being kinda racist, and 'gorilla' is a fairly standard metaphor for 'black guy'. It wouldn't surprise me if there were some serious racist undertones to that game..."
normaldayinjapan,3dx76c,vazzaroth,6,Mon Jul 20 13:27:10 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively ""safe-space"" kinda guy, and often very critical of Japanese ""unintentional"" racism. But in this case I kind of doubt it has racist connotations to it.  In Japan, Gorilla is often used as a metaphor for people that ehh... look like gorilla. (example, example 2). Racial minorities in Japan are invisible and socially hidden, and I would be surprised if they picked the protagonists to be anything but Japanese (or maybe white).  Also I wouldn't say ""bouncer/bodyguard = black guy"" reference exists in Japan.  edit: but I think its fair to suspect."

If you don't know the show basically the gimmick is she will dress up like a schoolgirl (she's in her late thirties) and paint on these really thick eyebrows for no reason, then go abroad and do various things. This one at a zoo is extreme for her - usually the stuff she does a typical ten year old would find slightly boring, or perhaps mildly interesting. Regardless, she's wailing like a dog in heat for the full hour, taking an elephant ride or climbing a ziggurat or whatever. I mean really wailing too, you have to see it to believe it.  Think if you gave Karl Pilkington serious brain damage, draped him in the British flag, pumped him full of methamphetamines, and sent him off to film ""An Idiot Abroad"". That's this show. I guess the Japanese find it funny enough, although the show is mercifully not being made anymore I think. But every person in the host country who interacts with this woman or the producers of this show leave the encounter thinking ""what the fuck is wrong with Japanese people"". She is a national embarrassment and she ought to be ashamed."

The exact dates vary: the main festivities fall on the first Sunday in April. The penis, as the central theme of the event, is reflected in illustrations, candy, carved vegetables, decorations, and a mikoshi parade.       The Kanamara Matsuri is centred on a local penis-venerating shrine. The legend being that a sharp-toothed demon (vagina dentata) hid inside the vagina of a young woman and castrated two young men on their wedding nights.  As a result, the young woman sought help from a blacksmith, who fashioned an iron phallus to break the demon's teeth, which led to the enshrinement of the item.

normaldayinjapan,35330f,muhowhow,2,Wed May 6 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"So nothing in the original that talks about suicide, and the link you posted is 404'd now. But I don't actually have anything against a robot designed to assist in suicide. Obviously you want to make sure it has a lot of settings and precautions so that it can't be accidentally or superficially triggered, and perhaps even needs a doctor authorization code or something, but allowing a robot to ""pull the trigger"" so to speak removes some of the issues with medical assisted suicide (in that you could blame the doctor who administers the injection for murder if you're an asshole). If it's a robot doing it, then that removes the human element by one step. (Making it akin to, say, a train conductor who is driving a train when someone jumps on the tracks. He is not responsible for the death, and although the train killed the person that is not the train's main purpose.)  I definitely think a lot of people commit suicide when they shouldn't and that most young, healthy people should have therapy or medication to help them through their issues.  But if you're terminally ill and vomiting feces and just waiting for your diesased body to stop working, or basically starving yourself to death slowly because you can no long eat or digest food, etc. and you're in constant agony, living in a haze of numbing drugs, and the hospital bill (at least in America) is ticking ever upward by the day, and there is 0% chance of recovery... yeah. I think it's a lot more humane to have a robot ""put you to sleep."""

Couple that with the fact that the corn doesn't taste as good as if it had been freshly picked and you get the reason why people don't usually get corn in the winter.  Because it wouldn't make sense to let 95% of your shipment spoil, grocers tend to bulk more on vacuum sealed corn when it's out of season."

I'm not a huge manga fan, but there are two places in Japan that I know of where you can find manga on the shelves that's not shrink wrapped. Book Off doesn't bother to reshrinkwrap it, unless it's smut, so the floor with manga on it is usually full of people just reading standing around reading manga. There is no seating on the manga floor.  also they can be pretty big and have large selections, even the english section was relatively big which would be good for expats. The manga sections are some of the only places to find classic manga, like original pokemon (for 100¥ even, pretty much everything was 100¥)."

It's the horizontal cylinder at the top, inside this capsule. There is a small metal wire handle hanging down in the middle.  Also, the plastic object in the upper-right of the photo (you can see the corner of it) is a television. There are about typically about 10 channels, typical variety. But there's always been one or two porn channels in the capsule hotels I've stayed at."

normaldayinjapan,2fqb03,thegirlontheredbicyc,16,Sat Sep 27 20:12:22 2014 UTC,"It's a bad place to stay if you have a lot of luggage.  Having said that, SOME places have a big closet room behind the front desk, and you can log your luggage in there. You are discouraged from bringing anything but yourself into the capsule.  You get a small locker to store your clothes in. Toiletries such as toothbrushes and shampoo are provided in the bathroom/shower areas. The expectation is that the small locker will be sufficient.  From what I understand, it's not meant for tourists. More as an alternative to a taxi home after a night of drinking, or if you are doing a short business trip within Japan. When I stayed, the crowd was mostly grungy old men and drunk blue-collar types. I've heard people fall out of the 2nd-tier capsules while drunkenly climbing up. Also lots of snoring."

normaldayinjapan,2egbpr,spiraltime,20,Tue Aug 26 03:37:24 2014 UTC,"Batman's cape works because Batman works in a poorly-lit city at night. The cape obscures his silhouette (often the only way you can be seen against a dark, urban backgound) and allows him to move around smoothly and silently. The ninja of Japan are known for doing the same thing with lose-fitting, black garments.   It also adds a supernatural element to an encounter with The Batman. Many times criminals have shot at him, only to have their bullets 'pass right through him!' or 'bounce off him like nothing!'. Batman's greatest weapon is fear, and the more supernatural he appears, the more criminals will fear him.   All that said, I have to agree - It looks absolutely ridiculous when he rides a motorcycle."
