suggestmeabook,3e54ls,avocadoaficionado_,2,Wed Jul 22 01:00:17 2015 UTC,Lipstick Jihad is a great memoir about an Iranian American living in Tehran.   I just finished James Madison: A Life Reconsidered by Lynne Cheney. Wow what a great book. Every fan of American history should read it.   1776 by David McCullough is also a great book.   For books that are anti-republican I recommend The New American Economy or Imposter. Both by Bruce Bartlett.   I think every American should read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.   The Worst Hard Time is a great book about the dust bowl.
suggestmeabook,3e33lk,grotesque_awareness,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"Not just a single book, but several series. From most addicting to least:  Seafort Saga by David Feintuch (may he rest in peace) I loved following Seafort's career. I felt like I grew with him and was, for a time, a part of him. It made me interested in the Naval culture that existed in the 16th-18th century.   The Imager Portfolio by L.E. Modesitt, Jr. Very similar to the Seafort saga, but with more intrigue and a fantasy setting. Rhenn is probably one of my favorite characters in a novel. He's so different from me - from culture to personality (tho there are some similarities there) that it has been a very refreshing learning experience. I can't say that about many books. I loved following Rhenn's journey from Portrait Painter to Imager and beyond, growing with him and his family. I'm not done reading it yet - only on the 3rd book. But the fact that I've read every page of what can often times be a meandering and overly in-depth story is a testament to how well written it is.   Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling As you might notice, a common theme in the books/series that pull me in the most is that you start from the beginning (or near it) with the main character and don't really switch perspectives. Harry Potter definitely follows this. I love a good, in-depth magic system, too. I honestly wouldn't mind another series of books that follow Harry Potter into his adult life. I feel like he would journey from Auror, to Hogwarts teacher, to headmaster and perhaps beyond. Or maybe in a different order."
suggestmeabook,3e33lk,ApocaRUFF,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:59 2015 UTC,"And Then There Were None by: Agatha Christie. Read it in one sitting.  Also just read Old Man's War by John Scalzi. Reminded me a lot of the stylings of the popular Fantasy authors (i.e. Routhfuss and Sanderson)  EDIT: I'm also in the middle of The Rabbit Back Literature Society By: (really long Finnish name) and it is incredibly compelling. A Twins Peak vibe but still manages to feel completely fresh and original. It's also proven to be a real page-turner without being a ""typical"" page-turner."

suggestmeabook,3e33lk,ThatSpencerGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"Compelling and Addicting? Huh! You'll probably get a lot of pretty popular suggestions--because that's how books become popular for a really broad audience!   Nearly anything by Malcom Gladwell, especially Tipping Point, Blink, and What the Dog Saw Harry Potter! Agatha Christie's best works, for example, And then There Were None, and The ABC Murders"
suggestmeabook,3e33lk,gaardyn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"Nearly anything by Malcom Gladwell, especially Tipping Point, Blink, and What the Dog Saw   Just don't read any articles about how completely wrong Gladwell is if you don't want to destroy your appreciation of his work."

It was one of those books that, for some reason, I couldn't put down until I finished it.  If I stopped reading, I would just think about it until I could continue reading.  I finished it in a day and a half.  I have a feeling if it took much longer to read, I would have lost interest at some point."

There are far more compelling books out there, but that is one that I found the most addicting."

suggestmeabook,3e33lk,thejoyofcraig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Most recently I could not stop reading a random book I came across: Still Falling by Martin Wilsey. It's the first of a trilogy, a classic sci-fi tale about a shipwrecked engineer on a hostile (populated) planet. Second book is coming out in September and I'm gnawing at the bit!"
suggestmeabook,3e33lk,LetsBlameYourMother,2,Tue Jul 21 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"Here are a couple of fairly obscure ones that I've never seen circlejerked before:   James Renner, The Man from Primrose Lane: It starts out as a Dennis-Lehane / Michael Connelly-esque dark mystery novel and 2/3rds of the way through takes a serious turn into just-plain-bonkers territory. Probably not for everyone, but I was glued to the kindle to the point of blowing-off social engagements until I finished. Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion. A social psychologist discusses his own and others' research re how people form moral/ethical judgments. Absolutely fascinating, the rare non-fiction book that you keep reading long after you promised yourself you'd turn in for the night. Of particular interest if you often find yourself rolling your eyes at online arguments on forums like reddit. Probably deserved to be the Black Swan or Freakonomics of 2012, but seems largely to have been overlooked."
suggestmeabook,3e33lk,mike413,2,Tue Jul 21 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"I might as well add a few for others! A few I have read in the past few weeks:   ""Room"" - Emma Donoghue.  It's written from the perspective of a 5 year old who lives in a room with his mom. That's all you need to know! ""All the Light You Cannot See"" - Anthony Doerr. Just about to finish this up. Fantastic story thus far! All-time favorite series that I rarely see on here: ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" If you can make it past the first 100 pages or so, you will be hooked for the rest of the series! I try not to think that this was planned to be a 9 novel series, but that could just be a rumor!  ""The Martian"" (obligatory)  ""11/22/63"" - Stephen King"

I ended up staying up until 3am devouring the last couple hundred pages of that book. If you dig through the archives here, you'll find several posts asking for books like HoL. There are only one or two actual responses to that request. (S by Doug Dorst & JJ Abrams is the definitive answer.)

suggestmeabook,3e514m,Itchy_Back,2,Wed Jul 22 00:32:20 2015 UTC,"Congrats on reading Orwell, those are two of my own favorites. ""The Road to Wigam Pier"" is another of his non-fiction, not equal two the others but worth reading. "" The Worst Journey in the World"" by a guy name Cherry (you'll have to look it up.) fits your definition. ""Sailing Alone Around the World"" by Joshua Slocum , also. I know they're fiction, but Orwell was very close to Evelyn Waugh and might try reading his African comedies ""Scoop"" and ""Black Mischief."" Also, since it's sort about travel ""Decline and Fall."" Those are some of the funniest stuff ever written."

suggestmeabook,3e45lu,Higgenbottoms,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"I am not a 17 year old boy.  But, I will tell you that I hated the Round House, and loved Poisonwood Bible.  The rest of the books I haven't read, so that's even less helpful.  Round House is about a young man on an Indian Reservation who's mother is brutally attacked, and there is a semi-mystery going on as he attempts to find out who did it.  It's more of a life on the rez type thing as opposed to a mystery though.  You might like it - I don't know your reading history.  Poisonwood Bible is (to me) very readable, written in a narrative that kept me turning pages.  It's the story of a good white christian family in the 60s going to Africa, to spread the word of god and putting themselves in a very bad situation as the country goes up in flames.  Its a story of hubris, and I love it."

suggestmeabook,3e45lu,kovixen,2,Tue Jul 21 22:46:29 2015 UTC,"So funny, I had the exact opposite reaction to these two books.  I found the Poisonwood Bible boring and stressful, but I do have many friends who enjoyed it so I might be an outlier.  I don't much like books that take place in Africa.  Round House was a much faster read for me, and I was curious to find out the ending.  Didn't love the very end though, cop out IMO.  I did also greatly enjoy Everything I Never Told You."

Don't trust the news.  Written in very accessible YA language, but absolutely not formulaic like most YA books have become.    The Queen of the Tearling by Erika Johansen .  The story starts very much like the beginning of Sleeping Beauty. Princess is sent out to the middle of nowhere to be raised by peasants only to return to her kingdom when she is old enough to rule. Except one day a group of badass knights sworn to protect her by her dead mother show up and escort her back to the kingdom dodging assassination attempts along the way.  Really great start to a series, second book just came out in June.    The Last Dragonslayer by Jasper Fforde.  There's really no way to describe this other than a modern British fantasy comedy verging on absurd.  Really hilarious, engaging, and poignant.  Also felt like a very quick read, even though it was 287 pages. I finished it overnight."

You pretty much just a take pics of your shelves within a frame and the app looks them up and makes a list of what you have. It didn't really work as advertised... It would show the spine of a book I had taken a pic of and assign a completely wrong title and author. You would then need to continue taking pics of that single spine and trying to get the app to assign the correct information to it. Kinda a pain so I just gave up.

Augusten Burrough's Running with Scissors is biographical, shocking/messed up, hilarious, and uplifting. This is a book someone who is homophobic or conservative might dislike but it is also a book my mother or pastor might enjoy. Ash Wednesday by Ethan Hawke (yes the actor) is about an AWOL marine and his pregnant girlfriend going on a  road trip to her parents. I would recommend this one to anyone wanting a change of pace from regular genre fiction it is heavy on dialogue and internal monologues so it is easy to get hooked on."

Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford - about the Chinese and Japanese communities in Seattle, going back and forth between the present day and the main character's relationship with his son, and WWII when the father was a child and the Japanese internment camps. Really beautiful and emotional.  Room by Emma Donoghue - narrated by a five-year-old who has lived his entire life held captive with his mother in a single room. A weird, excellent, heartbreaking page-turner."
suggestmeabook,3e337b,ThatSpencerGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"The kinds of books that spring to mind for me are books with some kind of literary merit (i.e., something you can sit around and talk about together), but that are also really accessible and likely to appeal to a wide audience. So, nothing very deep into any genre, nothing that's going to take a really unique stance, and nothing formally experimental. Ideally something with a story that moves along at a decent clip.   Books by John Irving are great. They're strange and dramatic and have big casts of memorable characters. They're sort of sentimental and occasionally really funny. His best two, I think, are The Cider House Rules and The World According to Garp. Note that Cider House includes a main character who is an abortion doctor. The book handles the topic with care, but in case there's someone who is especially sensitive about the topic, you might avoid it.  Johnathan Franzen is also a pretty safe choice. His two most recent novels, The Corrections and Freedom, are very human and kind of soapy, but I think really, truly great. Some people find the characters too ""unlikable"" to read about, and it's true that Franzen doesn't shy away from his characters' pettiest and most selfish sides, which some readers don't like, though others find it illuminating. Personally, what I love about those two books is how well he humanizes people behaving pretty badly.  There's also Donna Tartt, either The Secret History or The Goldfinch. Her work reminds me of Irving, now that I think about it. It's sweeping, kind of strange (a critic might say far-fetched), romantic, and entertaining."
suggestmeabook,3e08ha,starlingling,17,Mon Jul 20 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"Tina Fey's Bossypants had me laughing so hard while listening to the audiobook that my face hurt at the end of the road trip.  (That said, it's often mentioned in the same breath as Mindy Kaling's book, which I didn't find anywhere near as good.)  It's about her life pre-stardom in general.  A recent, great memoir about alcoholism and sobriety is Blackout by Sarah Hepola.  It's got some very funny moments and is a very poignant explanation of what it's like to try to live sober after having relied on alcohol for all social interaction for pretty much all of her adult life.  As far as fiction, if you're a fan of puns and like fiction that inserts a lot of jokes in the dialogue, Lorrie Moore is pretty amazing at both of those things.  I like her short stories better than her novels but I haven't disliked anything I've read by her.  If you enjoy Moore, I'd check out Renata Adler."

Twisted by Jeffrey Deaver is a collection of mystery short-stories, most of which are built around a twist or fake-out at the end.  They're dark and exciting and I had a fun time trying to figure out the curveballs the author was throwing.  McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales is an anthology of short stories by popular writers dedicated to bringing fun and genre back into short fiction, often by stepping outside of their own confines.  So you'll get stuff like a noir by Daniel Handler or a sci-fi about the end of the world by Nick Hornby.  It's great.  Finally, the funniest stories I've read come from The Vinyl Cafe collection by Stuart McLean.  They're a collection of charming stories about a used record store owner, and his wife, children, friends and neighbors.

suggestmeabook,3e0aso,Not_A_Hyperbole,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"I've never read them myself, but the works of Bernard Cornwell might be interesting to you. They follow the adventures of King Arthur, but, if I understand correctly from what I've heard of them, from a realistic side.   Another series I'm rather fond of is the King Raven Trilogy by Stephen Lawhead. It follows an exiled prince in Wales who is fighting off the Norman invaders who killed his father, stole his kingdom, and enslaved his people. Essentially, it's a realistic take of Robin Hood, but I found it to be way more interesting than that description makes it sound.  A third series that came to mind is a trilogy by Megan Whalen Turner beginning with the book The Thief. While it's technically fantasy (takes place in a fictional world with a few brief interactions with gods (nothing too jarring)), it borrows heavily from Greek culture and style. It's very realistic if you're willing to overlook it's fictional setting and those minor supernatural encounters.   That's all I can think of at the moment, but I hope they help!"

When my girlfriend passed, I actually had a lot of trouble reading lighter, silly stuff. I'd actually get a little angry at how trivial the issues seemed to me, and I'd have to put the book down.   The kinds of books I could read tended to be books that dealt with meaningful, important themes. It helped me put things in perspective a bit and to realize that while her death was the worse thing that has ever happened to me, it doesn't have to be the only important thing to have ever happened to me.   A book that is both meaningful, and funny may be a good way to go. A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is a book that helped me, but death is definitely a theme, so that may not be an option for your friend at this time. The book is something of a memoir written by a young guy whose parents both died pretty suddenly and left him to take care of his much younger brother. It's written very humorously despite the theme, and it was one of the funnier books I've read.   For something that steers away from death a little better, Christopher Moore's Lamb was really funny, but also touching and often uplifting. I'd also second a lot of Terry Pratchet's stuff, which fits the bill in a similar way."

""Can you keep a secret"" and ""Undomestic Goddess"" by Sophie Kinsella (she writes the shopaholic books for a reference) are so so funny. Literally LOL sometimes. Those are both great standalone books. Janet Evanovich writes the Stephanie Plum books (they made ""One for the Money"" into a truly awful movie with Katherine Heigel), which are super funny and totally entertaining.

A book I read recently is The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society. It's light and enjoyable to read without being too fluffy. Michael Chabon's Summerland is a great escape. It's a fantasy-ish young adult novel, but it definitely appeals to non-fantasy old adults as well.  If she's an action-y type person and hasn't already read them, I think the Hunger Games trilogy would actually do an admirable job of taking one's mind off of something (as well as off of eating and sleeping).  The other one I'm thinking of is Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex, but maybe that's just because I recommend that to everyone. It may be too heavy, but it is a wonderful, beautiful book."

For example, you might love the world, the characters, how exciting the story was, the language. There are a lot of classic epic fantasies out there. The Shannara series by Terry Brooks is a little lighter than Tolkein, but has that classic fantasy feel with elves, magic, and a quest. A more recent trilogy that's really great is Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson. Sanderson excels at creating interesting worlds and magic systems, and his plots and characters aren't too shabby either. It's not fantasy, but I think Dune by Frank Herbert is a great next read after LOTR, It has the crazy detailed worldbuilding and the epic scale."

Ngaio Marsh wrote mysteries in a very similar vein as Christie, and at about the same time--tight plotting, clever twists, evocative settings. I also love Dorothy Sayers' mystery novels, the first of which I believe is in public domain and available through Project Gutenberg. For current novels with a not entirely dissimilar feel, Aaron Elkins and Laurie King are powerhouses, imho, and Ian Rankin does a more thriller/gritty interpretation but has similarly dense plotting and really vivid background.   Second Charlie Stross as akin to Dresden Files, but also wanted to add that Seanan McGuire's October Daye novels are quite similar--fae instead of wizards, SF Bay Area instead of Chicago, but PI main characters caught up in big events and permanently having to crawl out of disaster areas. And Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of London series is similar to Dresden Files but instead of being a PI and operating alone, the main character is actually a policeman."
suggestmeabook,3dyynd,VerityPrice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:31:16 2015 UTC,"If you like the Dresden Files and want something similar (but arguably better) I'd suggest The Laundry Files by Charlie Stross - It's an action modern fantasy series that follows a newly commissioned occult agent.

Naomi is an English Lit major whose particular love is the Napoleonic Wars which she studied extensively. Her particular gift (in this series) is taking the Aubrey-Maturin ideals - an intelligent and adaptable captain, a great ship with a dedicated crew, discipline, the great war and works of men, and injecting that unique take on the world.

What I know about high-frequency trading: HFTs make use of microwave transmitters to send orders faster than those firms using fiber optic cables. Because of that, they take a different look at market neutral strategies regarding timing and the size of the spread. And so they make multiple trades over the span of milliseconds to profit on small spreads converging instead of waiting for wide spreads to converge (common among statistical arbitrage and merger arbitrage hedge funds). To do this, they use trading algorithms to trade automatically.   HFT firms are hedge funds which are less regulated than other financial institutions as they're meant for ""smart investors"".   The only legitimate problem I've heard about HFTs is that there's evidence they knew that the Fed wouldn't taper their bond purchasing program in late 2013. But other financial institutions would have known if HFT firms knew. I haven't read through his research paper on it but there's a MIT economist who says that HFTs didn't cause the Flash Crash which they're commonly blamed for.   Most of what I know about financial markets comes from reading different sources e.g. academic and government finance researchers as well as work from the researchers and practitioners (namely quants, strategists and risk managers) in the financial industry."

suggestmeabook,3dy7om,Roxoorz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"I've read through your comment history and see that you've got a relationship going on. I'm mostly a science fiction/fantasy person, and my interest flows from there. One of the best things about science fiction is one of the primary goals is the exploration of the human condition and spirit. With all that stated, you've asked for something that makes you think about life - I'm taking that you'd like stories that deal with the philosophical side of living, that is, thinking about the value of one human life, and focuses on introspection.  There's two recommendations I'm going to make and qualify for you, but keep in mind my bias for enjoying fantasy/scifi.  Transformation by Carol Berg - Carol writes with a most deft touch. Her focus is on a single character and their deep introspection into their life and values... after they've been broken and had everything of value taken from them. Transformation is the story of a man in his 30s who was once a great warrior... before he was taken as a slave. The novel picks up a decade later. Forced to learn his place, he adapted to a life of servitude and a desire to be unnoticed. The story picks up as he slowly discovers he still has a value to offer the world. His passions tempered and his great powers taken from him, he seeks to find a balance to survive. The novel is told from first person perspective following his internal narrative. The story is a rich one, long and rewarding, but does have violence in it.  A Shadow in Summer by Daniel Abraham - This is an unusual recommendation for what you asked. I'm making a number of assumptions. A Shadow in Summer is one of those unusual experiences that is hard to describe to someone. It is set in an unusual fantasy world where what we would call immensely skilled hackers/programmers are instead poets. These poets are trained through their entire lives to complete one great work, where any misstep, any mistake, any single error in their life's poem will result in horrible death for them. Should they succeed, their reward is a lifetime chained to their creation, a force of nature given life, who at all times seeks to harm all around them. The novel follows a young poet who is sent on an assignment to learn from the Poet in charge of Seedless. Seedless is a concept of nature, given life whose ability is to remove the essence of growth potential from anything. The great power is used to remove seeds from cotton, thus making this nation great profit. - I recommend this book as it follows a young protagonist sent into a world he is ill prepared for. The novel follows his perspective as he deals with adapting to a city that cares little for him beyond the potential he has to take Seedless should the current Poet pass on. Love, pain, great loss, loneliness and depression are the major themes of this first book by Daniel, who would go on to create such great fantasy and science fiction novels.  Daniel, for those who do not know, is part of the team known as James S. A. Corey who created the Leviathan Wakes series.  So, Rox, I hope this helps. It may not be exactly what you want."

You might know the author from Beyonce's ***Flawless video, which samples her TED talk. The book is based on the author's experience during the civil war in Nigeria in (I think) the 90s. It does a great job of exploring issues of race in a really sensitive and eye-opening way, plus it has a strong female protagonist and a great love story. Hands down the best book I've read this year!"

suggestmeabook,3du7yr,beautifultomorrows,9,Sun Jul 19 17:50:49 2015 UTC,Le Guin is a great recommendation. She is a totally rad feminist and a great author. Margaret Atwood would be another good one IMO.

suggestmeabook,3du7yr,AzureMagelet,6,Mon Jul 20 00:26:16 2015 UTC,"If you'd like to introduce them to a new genre, I'd suggest - Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie - It is one of those rare science fiction action books that is not focused on a warrior protagonist. Instead, it follows a unique being who has lost everything because of her love for another but is not a pining for lost love story. Instead it is a story about relationships, both establishment and losing of them, and how those impact us. It is emotional and wonderfully told and has action without being an action story. It's a short novel. Ann's a wonderful writer.  Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson - This is a genre starter that introduced a wide range of people to the best fantasy has to offer. Like Ancillary Justice, it is not a violent tale, but it has good action and clear, well-written prose with excellent and deep characters.  Both novels feature women protagonists who are discovering themselves. Neither are tropish (damsel in distress) and both are satisfying on their own, and yet part of a wider story in case your audience is interested in further exploration. They're great starters in their genres that respect women."

'The Martian' by Andy Weir is a soon-to-be-film and it was a super-fun read for anyone interested in space. It's about a guy who gets stuck on Mars after being left for dead by a crew of astronauts.  I also think Margaret Atwood is a good choice, as is mentioned below. 'The Handmaid's Tale' can probably be considered a classic at this point, as it's taught in a lot of college courses. It's a feminist what-if tale. She's a prolific Canadian and this novel was ahead of its time. It's very relevant.  Kudos for sticking with an all female book club!"

suggestmeabook,3du7yr,DrTelus,2,Sun Jul 19 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for something very readable but also sciency, I recommend 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.' It's about the lady whose cells were the first cells to grow in culture well and thus started a revolution in biology, medicine, etc. It talks about that progress, while at the same time profiling her, a poor black woman, a recent descendant of slaves, whose descendants live in Baltimore unable to afford health care and thus benefit from the discoveries made using their mother's cells. Makes you think about the interplay of science and society.  'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' by Betty Smith is great. It's a classic, atleast taught in high schools in NYC. It's a coming of age story about an Irish girl. It's uplifting.  +1 to the other mentions of 'A Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Atwood.  'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls. It's a memoir about Walls' family and growing up. Her parents were kind of weird vagrants. She turns out all right.  'The Poisonwood Bible' by Barbara Kingsolver. About an American missionary family who lives in Africa. Main character is one of three (? it's been a while...) daughters. Life is not super easy."

Most of the book has good imagery, but certain scenes have some of the most vivid imagery I have ever encountered. The novel's imagery ranges from the descriptions of Roman Yerusalaim (Jerusalem), to very accurate descriptions of 1930's Moscow, to beautiful sequences that seem to come from the mind of the most skilled cinematographer. But, as I said, it is my one of my favourites, so I might be a bit biased."

If you want a quicker read, go with his young adult series, The Abarat and make sure to get the ILLUSTRATED EDITIONS as he did his own paintings for the books (each containing @100 each... google for examples) or even check out his short story collection, The Books of Blood which put an entire genre on the map."

Yellow, white, red, jacinth, all the various colors of flame—here and there a green or blue one, where some temple's altar fire had been sprinkled with salt or copper filings. And every one of those shining beads and clusters and bands of light shone twice, each having its brilliant reflection in the lake. Even the stone causeways that vault from the island to the mainland, even those wore lanterns on posts at intervals along their reach across the water. From our acáli, I could see only the two causeways going north and south from the city.

It is told from the point of view of an Oprichnik, a high-up member a a secret police like organization. This one is more modern, as it was written in 2006.  ""We"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin is similar to ""Brave New World"", but Orwell preferred it. ""We"" does not necesarily focus on government, but more on one prison.  Alexandr Solhenstyn was a Nobel-winning author who wrote about the Gulags. This could be of use to you.

suggestmeabook,3dth24,Slurpee14,4,Sun Jul 19 10:01:40 2015 UTC,"While most of the suggestions here so far are great novels, I feel like they're horrible starting points. While Stephen King is certainly more than a horror writer, that's still what he's primarily known for, and where I feel you should start.   I would suggest starting with Night Shift, his first collection of short stories. Many of them have been adapted into movies, most famously Children of the Corn and Trucks, the latter being the basis for the movie Maximum Overdrive. Starting here will give you a feel for his writing without tying you down to hundreds of pages of a story you may or may not enjoy.   If you enjoy that and want to explore deeper, then I would suggest going with one of the earlier horror novels, either The Shining or Cujo. Firestarter isn't necessarily horror but it's worth considering as well.   After that, it would be safe to jump into his more mainstream or longer works. Different Seasons contains four novellas, two of which were the basis for the movies Stand By Me and The Shawshank Redemption.   Don't start with The Dark Tower series. It's eight books long and King's magnum opus. You only start with someone's magnum opus if you aren't interested in them and only want to experience the best of their work. By definition, it's all down hill from there.   The Stand is over a thousand pages long. As it was written in the '70s, it does give you a feel for King's early work, I feel like it's too much of a commitment to an author you may or may not enjoy, when there are so many shorter works that can ease you in.   I see people suggesting Eyes of the Dragon every time this topic arises. I suspect that's because we have an abundance of fantasy nerds (I use that term non-disparagingly, I'm one of you) who are going off the sort of thing they enjoy and not really thinking about the best place to start. Subject-wise, it isn't really indicative of King's other work and won't necessarily give you any indication as to whether or not you'll enjoy it.   I would shy away from 11/22/63 sheerly because I feel early King is the proper place to start. If you don't enjoy his earlier work, however, I would try this before giving up.   One other potential starting point would be the novella Ur, which I feel fits in with King's early work but is decidedly more modern. It was originally published exclusively for the Kindle but it's being included in the new collection that comes out in November. It's about a Kindle from another dimension that accidentally ends up in someone's hands."

The reason why people still keep recommending you stories like that, is because that's the only way the question still makes sense, if you make it be about stories that are still recognizably superhero stories because there are capes in them, but non-cheesy in the sense that they rationally question what sort of person would dress up in an anmal-themed costume and punch criminals in the face as a hobby, or they blurry the line between immoral superheroes and virtous supervillains, or something like that.   In that sense, I would repeat the already recommended Worm web serial by Wildbow, which is rather good at all of these points."

It follows one of the most interesting people of the time, I think: Ann Putnam, Jr. She was 12 years old at the time and became one of the leading accusers. It follows the chronology and characters more historically accurately than the Crucible, though includes a fictional magic scene and my own postulations about parental abuse and power struggles.   It is YA, (I won't speak as to how much better than twilight it is haha) but the audience so far has been adults. Hope you don't mind me spamming this. Summary & links at www.oliverdahl.com/lies.

I'd say with my first two, it's more the first one I'm not overly fond of. (You probably also read my age. I'm 17 now, and my first book came out when I was 13.) There's just a lot I'd change or reword to match the style I've grown into. I'm always thrilled (if not also surprised) to see positive reviews for it, though. Glad to know some people can still enjoy it even if I don't! It's targeted towards middle school school students, but has (again surprisingly) been enjoyed by adults. But those two are pretty fun, silly books. They're also available on Amazon as paperbacks.  My writing grew a lot between each book and will definitely continue growing. So it should be fun to follow the improvement of my writing with each book I put out, cause each one's been way better than the last, IMO.  Working on 2-3 books at the moment.

If you'd like a wider story that focuses on the changes this would cause to society, I'd recommend The Guardians of the Flame (omnibus book) by Joel Rosenberg which is considered the premiere version of this.

Also, Jumanji and The Polar Express by Chris van Allsburg.  You might also try some of the shorter Roald Dahl books, like Fantastic Mr. Fox or The Twits.

While a true story, the book reads like a novel and is very compelling.   On the fiction front, you might enjoy Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson. Much of the novel centers around The Metaverse, a global virtual reality MMO. Someone has figured out how to create a virus that affects the human brain as well as computers. The main character, Hiro Protagonist, seeks the source of this weapon, which he had plenty of time to do having lost his job delivering pizzas for the mafia.

The characters are teenagers but the novel itself is decidedly adult. The story follows that every year, 100 teenager (two per state) participate in an event called The Long Walk. They start on the Maine/Canada border and begin heading south, along the eastern cost of the United States. If you slow down, you get a warning. For every hour that you walk at the required speed, you can clear one warning. If you amass three warnings, you get ticketed. The ticket earns you a collection of bullet holes in your flesh. They continue until there's only one person left. The winner gets whatever they want.  I often see people claiming The Hunger Games ripped off Battle Royale, but The Long Walk proceeded them both by more than two decades.  Frank Drabont (who wrote & directed The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Mist owns the theatrical rights, so hopefully we'll see the story told on film some day, but the novel is probably my favorite of Stephen King's works."

Can you give a little more detail on what would interest you? Ex: Are you interested in commentary on political systems through sci-fi/fantasy, characters conflicting with or encountering different political systems from their own, or more along with the politics of governance.   From your post, I'm guessing the latter is your case, so I'm going to offer two suggestions. There are more, I just do not read too many of them.  Fantasy that deals with empires and politics: The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison - The only flaw is that this is a single, perfect novel. It follows the machinations of a powerful fantasy empire just after the emperor's family dies and rulership passes to an unexpected heir. Deals with a lot of intrigue, told from the perspective of the heir.  Malazan: Book of the Fallen - This series follows the political upheaval and machinations that occur when a conquering warrior culture wins its last battles and has its emperor overthrown. Told from many perspectives and spans a wide range of cultures. Violent, bloody, deep, and long, this series spans 10 novels starting with Gardens of the Moon.

Now my experience with The Gunslinger is somewhat flawed, as when I was about 85% of the way through my ebook file got corrupted and I've been unable to repair it, so my perception of this book is somewhat skewed.  Likewise I read wheel of time when it was about 9 books long, put it down and haven't read it since, so likewise skewed.  Mistborn is an excellent series for several reasons, and I'll get the most obvious one out of the way: it's fucking awesome. The magic works in a really cool way that is all internally consistent, the action is very well done and there are villains that may honestly give Darth Vader a run for his money as ""most badass"".  Aside from the action, the characters are very likable even if flawed, they all have very strong character arcs, features one of the strongest female characters I've ever seen. The world is one of surprising depth, and honestly it's just a very cool read.  Then there's the fact of the 4th book. Now, my opinion on the mistborn trilogy was 1 is better than 2, and 2 is better than 3. Many will likely disagree with me, but that's just how I see it. The 4th book, however, blows the original trilogy out of the water (in my opinion) and is simply an astoundingly fun read start to finish, and only serves to highlight the best bits of the original trilogy."

It took me so long to read because I would read one book and say, ""Oh, God, I don't want to read another because then I'll be one more step towards the end of this series."" I was so upset when I finished it because I couldn't read it for the first time again. I hadn't read many King novels before this and it got me hooked on his style. There's a reason he's so popular.  I disliked Mistborn. I don't think that Sanderson is a very good writer. He is brilliant at creating worlds and magic systems and characters, he's just terrible at fitting them all together. I didn't like any of the main characters at all. That said, the story is amazing and the twists and turns are fantastic. His ability to swerve you and get you to focus on one thing whilst moving things about in the background is akin to a stage magician. I read the first book and was never so happy to be done with it, but my girlfriend urged me to read on. I don't regret reading them, but it was a slog.  The Wheel of Time is a book series that I really enjoy but can only listen to them on Audiobook. The world is so immersive, Jordan spends forever just building these amazing towns and fantastic settings. It, like The Dark Tower, is one where I finish a book and need a breather before the next one. I, however, might be missing out on some things because, as I said, I listen to the audiobooks, usually while doing other things.  Just my opinions, OP, but you can't do badly with any of the three series!"
suggestmeabook,3dnq8k,SOB-17,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:36:10 2015 UTC,"WoT is my favorite series by far. Sanderson did a great job of finishing it.   Ironically, Mistborn isn't as good. The first book was good enough to keep me reading, the second was better, and the third was great.   But still not as mind blowing as WoT."
suggestmeabook,3dnq8k,thewindupbirds,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what you are looking for! They're quite different: WoT is high fantasy in a very classic sense, Dark Tower is dark fantasy/western, and Mistborn is dark-ish high fantasy that goes against many of the tropes that pop up in series like WoT. Personally, WoT is a bit too... classic? for me (if that's the right phrase) but many people absolutely adore it. Dark Tower starts out very strong but takes a lot of perseverance. Mistborn is the shortest of those you've listed, since the first trilogy is only 3 books (obviously), though it will eventually be a LOT more and cover several different genres (first trilogy is high fantasy, there's a middle series that's western/noir, next two will be modern and then cyberpunk)."
suggestmeabook,3dnq8k,whomad1215,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"Mistborn is the shortest. Wheel of time can definitely drag and is massive. Dark tower is detailed and benefits greatly if you've read some other works of King.   I'd vote for Mistborn, followed by the dark tower, then wheel of time.   Jordan is a great author, but I personally only got through book 7 before I had to take break.   Oh, the stormlight archive only has two books so far, but is easily one of my favorite series in a while so far, Sanderson is apparently about 10% of the way done with the third also."

suggestmeabook,3dndgq,gaardyn,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"I would suggest exploring Haruki Murakami. He's a wonderful writer (if we were to take a poll of SMAB, he would likely come in second behind Vonnegut) and his books are highly literary yet still very accessible.  I would suggest starting out with either Norwegian Wood or Kafka on the Shore. The former is about a Japanese college student during the 1960s, the latter is about a high school runaway during modern times.  Norwegian Wood does have a couple of major romantic plotlines but I wouldn't classify it as a romance novel by any means. Kafka on the Shore has heavy paranormal aspects.  There seems to be a schism between Murakami fans as to which is better. Kafka on the Shore advocates often claim that Norwegian Wood was too ""childish"" for their tastes, though I'm not quite sure that's the accurate word for it. Norwegian Wood advocates rarely have anything negative to say about Kafka on the Shore but I've seen many people who consider Norwegian Wood their absolutely favorite book of all time.  Then, of course, there are people like me who loved both books (though I favor Norwegian Wood). I'm sure there are people that don't like either of them, but those sort of people probably poop their pants on a bi-monthly basis.  If you turn out to be a fan of Haruki Murakami, he has a dozen novels, a few collections and one children's novel, so you'll have plenty of options on where to go next."

There are 8 books in the series proper, so it will last you a good amount of time.   Based on your tastes, you might enjoy Sacajawea by Anna Lee Waldo. It's a massive (1300+ pages) historical fiction novel that covers all of Sacajawea's known life then goes on to speculate what might have happened to her in her later years. While it's fictionalized, the author spent a decade researching the subject to make it as realistic as possible. With the exploration during the Lewis and Clark expedition and the Shoshone lore, it feels a bit like a fantasy novel.

The first book doesn't pick up until about halfway, but when it does, you'll be hooked for the rest of the series. Area X by Jeff VanderMeer is also well narrated. It straddles a lot of genres and the whole trilogy is available for one credit for the omnibus. The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury - the narrator has just enough 50s TV panache to his voice (keeping in mind that a little goes a long way) to make this a fantastic listen.

He masterfully imitates all of the returning characters from the original trilogy while giving all of the new characters Zahn introduces to the universe their own unique voices. His Han Solo voice, for example, is especially good. The audiobook is also dramatized so it feels like you're watching a movie.  The Thrawn Trilogy is the -now- unofficial sequel to the original trilogy and is highly regarded among fans. Set 7 years after the Battle of Endor, what was supposed to be a ""mopping up operation"" on the remaining Imperial forces quickly turns into another full fledged war for the New Republic when Grand Admiral Thrawn returns from deep space to lead the Empire. Thrawn is one of the best villains I have ever seen. He is cunning, logical, ruthless, and seemingly omnipotent. All of the new characters Zahn added to the universe have a lot of depth and are all extremely interesting while all of the returning characters are written perfectly to form. Seriously, this series is better than the films. It is a must-read for any fan of Star Wars."

Even if it's a collection of erotic science fiction or cookbooks, it should be on the shelf.   Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita is definitely required reading for any English major.   As someone already mentioned, the Russian classics should not be overlooked. Personally, Crime and Punishment is my favorite novel of all time, but I have to sheepishly admit I still haven't gotten to The Brothers Karamazov yet. I'll be putting it on my ereader shortly.   I feel like Mark Twain doesn't get enough love in discussions like this. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should definitely be mandatory reading. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer may not be as much of a masterpiece but it's still a great tale. Don't ignore Twain's short stories, either. (In fact, if we're talking building a library, I recall a wonderful compendium of all of his novels and stories. If you're interested, I'll do some research and find the exact volume I remember.)   I have a fondness for Jack Kerouac and feel he occupies an important enough place in the American canon that even his detractors will begrudgingly amir he should be read, even if they think it's as an example of how not to write. On the Road is his most famous work, but I preferred his followup The Dharma Bums. I would also strongly encourage you to read two of his shorter works, Tristessa and The Subterraneans.   As a nearly forty year old writer, I firmly believe be in the importance of children's literature in keeping one's mind open to the world of possibilities. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Alice's Adventure Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll are the quintessential classics in this regard, for good reason. Much more modern but equally wonderful is The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster. I also encourage everyone to read the original Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, which contain much more than just the parts everyone knows from the movie. (Did you know there are more than 40 books in the Oz series, 17 of which were written by Baum himself, the others by writers he authorized?)   I could go on and on about this subject, but it's time for lunch. If the suggestions resonate with you, I'd be happy to provide another round."

You might like to visit Maurice. It was written 1917-1919 but not published until after the author's death in 1971 due to the ""controversial"" nature &amp; I guess Forster didn't want to make his private life public. It's beautiful though. Forster is a fine master of the art &amp; if you read anything he published you'll do well.    George Orwell, naturally. But read Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Down & Out in Paris & London. These are nothing like 1984 & Animal Farm. Orwell & Forster knew each other & both worked at the BBC so they're interesting to juxtapose.   Read Virginia Woolf. Personally, my favourites are Mrs Dalloway &amp; The Waves. She's good to match up with James Joyce of course! IIIRC it was Woolf & her husband's company that published Ulysses  And check out George Eliot. I have only read a couple of hers, so I guess Middlemarch is the go to for her. I'll rethink this because I know I've read something else by Eliot & it's gone out of my head. I think The Mill on the Floss is hers...it's very good.   If you want the best of the Brontë's go straight to Villette by Charlotte. It is the best of all of them (in my opinion - I'm sure there will be arguments over that!)  I recently read & adored Graham Greene's The End of the Affair. That was something rather special. Beautiful.   You should consider Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens (A Tale of Two Cities is awesome!) Henry James. W Somerset Maugham (I best like The Moon &amp; Sixpence.

If you're looking for something recent with interesting storytelling techniques, Ann Leckie (""Ancillary Justice"") and Jeff Vandermeer (""Annihilation"") might be of interest, too.

suggestmeabook,3dk1h8,ewokkwarrior,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:45:31 2015 UTC,"My favorite Authurian fantasy is Stephen R Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle. It starts with the destruction of a fictional Atlantis and follows the survivors onto Britain and into history with the retreat of the Roman Empire and the Saxon invasion.  Now if you want a book that is therapeutic/cathartic but enjoyable to read then check out Augusten Burrough's Running with Scissors. It is funny, effed up, and uplifting.   These are two recommendations I never thought would go together....   Edit: Also Siddhartha by Herman Hess is something everyone unsure about their future should read."

So there's no issue of piracy and other intellectual property issues other than crediting the author for the work and saying thanks to his/her facebook page when you have the time."
suggestmeabook,3dibse,MajesticQ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:13 2015 UTC,That's perfect thanks!  Also looking for similar stories as well in case anyone knows of some.
suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,cobainsdragon,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"Have you read Peter V Brett's The Warded Man or Scott Lynch's Lies of Lock Lamora? If not you should start there, they are popular contemporaries to the authors you mentioned.   If you have read those... I am a huge fan of Anne McCaffrey's Pern and Catteni series, they are completed and you should be able to find them new or used in paperback. Also Carol Berg's Rai Kirah series. I like to say she is the female version of Brandon Sanderson, great worldbuilding and technical/thoughtful story writing."
suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,Imaninja2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:32 2015 UTC,The Warded Man looks really interesting and up my ally. I just checked my local book stores online inventory and they don't have any in right now unfortunately. I have read Lies of Lock Lamora. Thanks for the suggestions!

suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,themonkeyparade,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:28 2015 UTC,"I'm the author of Do Not Resuscitate (Nicholas Ponticello). I really think it fits the bill for what you're looking for--a fast, fun read about life, death and immortality in the near future. Part scifi, part mystery, part humor. Check it out at http://www.amazon.com/dp/099082473X."
suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,ewokkwarrior,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:48:25 2015 UTC,Throne of Glass is a great fantasy series. I'm in they middle of it now!
suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,Nihil_Sanctum,0,Fri Jul 17 10:35:17 2015 UTC,Aztec tops that list.
suggestmeabook,3dk4ev,Nihil_Sanctum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:28 2015 UTC,That looks really good too. Just checked though and my local book store doesn't have it in stock either. damn it!
