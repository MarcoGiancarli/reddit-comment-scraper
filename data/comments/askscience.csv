askscience,3e2t6v,NowHerePresent,4,Tue Jul 21 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"To follow up on this question, what is your opinion on Daniel Amen's, MD research on ADHD (assuming you're familiar with it because he's high profile and controversial )?"
askscience,3e2t6v,NewAccount4Friday,3,Tue Jul 21 17:29:42 2015 UTC,Followup question: I got a 137 (99%ile) for Processing Speed Index on the WAIS-IV test.  I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD and often feel like my brain is 2-3 sentences ahead of my mouth and this causes me to sometimes not finish the last few words of my sentence or even slightly stutter if I get excited about a topic.   Is there a drug or CBT out there that can address this phenomenon? I've tried smaller doses of adderall and Vyvanse (40mg) and that hasn't done it for me yet.
askscience,3e2t6v,D4ddyW4rbux,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Adderall is a trade name for the drug amphetamine, and vyvanse is a slightly modified form of dextroamphetamine.  It is important to note that a substantial portion of people with ADHD respond better to either amphetamine or methylphenidate.  From what you've said, you have not yet tried methylphenidate.  I would definitely recommend that you do so, as approximately 90% of ADHD patients respond to at least one of the two drugs."
askscience,3e2t6v,Optrode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"to add on to your statement the most common brand name methylphenidates are Ritalin, Concerta, and Focalin (dexmethylphenidate). Focalin being the strongest of the 3."
askscience,3e2t6v,moocow921,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"I can answer some of that!  I am a neuroscientist and I have ADHD, and I take amphetamine (AKA Adderall).  Also, regarding treatment, please see my comment elsewhere in this thread.  The tl;dr is that there is really no treatment that is as effective as stimulant medication (typically either amphetamine or methylphenidate), and those medications are extremely safe and may even have greater beneficial effects if given during childhood / adolescence.  Regarding what is going on in the brain of someone with ADHD:  The brain is...   Really ludicrously complex.  The tools we have available to us are very limited in their ability to look at the fine details of what's going on in a living human brain.  You can do fMRI studies of people with and without ADHD, sure, but even if you DO observe a difference in activity, the area you're seeing that difference in probably contains a hundred million neurons, and you have no way whatsoever of knowing which neurons in that area are acting unusually (since different subgroups of neurons in a given brain structure usually have very different jobs).  So our best guesses about what's going on in ADHD are really quite limited.  Here's what we DO know:  The neurotransmitter dopamine (which is often, stupidly, referred to as ""the reward chemical"") is used by many different brain systems, including some relating to reward or motivation, others relating to movement, one system relating to lactation..  The list goes on.  But some of the important dopamine pathways that we believe might be abnormal in people with ADHD are dopamine pathways relating to motivation and attention.  This is supported by the finding that certain versions of certain genes that are related to dopamine function are associated with increased risk of ADHD, and also by the fact that drugs that affect dopamine tend to affect ADHD symptoms.  But, there is probably a lot more to it than that.  It is almost certainly NOT a simple matter of ""too much / too little"" of some particular neurotransmitter.  The ""too much / too little of this neurotransmitter"" way of thinking about mental disorders is commonly used to explain things because it's easy to understand, but it's pretty much always wrong.  I know of perhaps 1 or 2 disorders that are actually legitimately caused by an overall excess or deficit of a particular chemical in the brain (e.g. phenylketonuria).  Some more nuanced evidence for the pathology of ADHD comes from EEG studies.  Among other things, EEG can be used to assess temporary connections between brain areas, in the form of synchronized brainwaves between brain areas.  There is some evidence that people with ADHD have abnormal communication between brain areas, particularly involving the frontal cortex, a part of the brain particularly associated with making decisions and evaluating choices, which may be related to the impulsivity and difficulty sticking to a task that people with ADHD often experience.  I think we will find out more within the next couple decades, as methods for both examining the activity of live human brains AND for creating and studying animal models of ADHD (which can potentially assess the role of much more specific neural circuits in the disorder) improve."

askscience,3e2t6v,Catharcissism,9,Tue Jul 21 18:50:53 2015 UTC,What do you think about the long-term effects of medications for ADD and depression prescribed to children nowadays?
askscience,3e2t6v,zjbird,6,Tue Jul 21 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"I am a neuroscientist, and I have ADHD and take stimulant medication.  Regarding ADHD meds:  You may know that the most commonly prescribed ADHD medications are drugs like amphetamine or methylphenidate.  What you should ALSO know, however, is that the dosage and method of administration makes a REALLY HUGE DIFFERENCE when it comes to how dangerous a drug is, and how addictive it is.  People who take large, recreational doses of drugs like amphetamine, and take it in different ways (e.g. crushing & snorting pills) are VASTLY more likely to be harmed by the drug or develop an addiction.  Amphetamine and methylphenidate have been in use for about half a century now, and when taken at the prescribed dose, they are extremely safe.  They have a good therapeutic index, meaning that there is a large margin of safety between the dose that will successfully treat ADHD and the dose that is dangerous.  They have a very good side effect profile.  And there is even some evidence that suggests that, contrary to what popular opinion might have you believe, being given stimulant medication during adolescence can actually produce a long term improvement in the outlook for kids with ADHD.  (What would you think if someone's child had epilepsy, and they hemmed and hawwed about ""the dangers of giving such strong medications to children""?)  It's also worth considering that ADHD is a very, very real disability that can hold someone back in life in ways that are sometimes simply impossible for someone without ADHD to understand.  About 90% of people with ADHD will respond well to either methylphenidate or amphetamine, and most people experience only very mild side effects.  The positive effects, for kids OR adults, can be life-changing.  And interventions like teaching study skills simply are not effective.  Clinical studies have shown that therapy interventions have relatively little effect on school performance and other ADHD symptoms, but that adding medication makes a very big difference.  People with ADHD can learn better ways to handle life, but what they can't do very easily is put it into practice, so the results are disappointing.  Medication helps make it possible to take the skills you learn and actually apply them when you need them.  Medication for ADHD does more than just help with schoolwork.  I, personally, have had trouble as an adult controlling my emotions and thinking before I speak.  Medication has made it much easier for me to think carefully about my own emotions, and find ways to express them that are appropriate to the situation (which has odne wonders for my relationship with my wife!).  My ability to keep up with research and teaching responsibilities has improved substantially.    Antidepressants (particularly SSRIs), by contrast, have extremely weak supporting evidence.  They are at best marginally more effective than placebos, and have very unpleasant side effects.  They are generally poorly tolerated by patients.  They're pretty sucky drugs."
askscience,3e2t6v,Optrode,-5,Tue Jul 21 18:20:12 2015 UTC,Adderall is amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. The effects of chronic amphetamine administration are pretty well documented.

askscience,3e2t6v,zjbird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"Hey now, there is all sorts of peer reviewed literature out there on the effects of amphetamine use. There are plenty of clinical trials examining specifically the drugs used to treat ADD.

askscience,3e2t6v,ForScale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's possible, sure! I would imagine that the negative side effects would still be there though... If not, it'd be valid to say that people with attention deficit disorders are somehow immune (or show a degree of immunity) to the ill effects typically seen with daily amphetamine use."
askscience,3e2t6v,ForScale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"Please see my response to the original question.  Overall, people with ADHD typically develop a tolerance which rapidly reduces side effects, but do not develop a tolerance to the therapeutic effects.  When taken orally at normal doses, amphetamine and methylphenidate tend to continue to produce good therapeutic effects with minimal side effects.  The story becomes very different if you take bigger doses, or snort the drug."
askscience,3e2t6v,Optrode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"Overall, people with ADHD typically develop a tolerance which rapidly reduces side effects   Don't most people who use most recreational drugs develop rapid tolerance (or at least learn to ignore) the more unpleasant aspects of the substances they use? But they keep using them cause those drugs make them feel better?  Is there a studying showing that people with ADHD develop tolerance side effects of amphetamine faster than those who have been screened and found not to have ADHD?"
askscience,3e2t6v,ForScale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"I am uncertain about differences between people with ADHD and people without, but I can tell you that monoaminergic drugs of the same class as amphetamine (e.g. cocaine) tend to have a pattern of effects that develop either tolerance or sensitization.  One very common effect of cocaine, for example, that is studied in rats is locomotor sensitization, in which the effect of the drug on overall levels of locomotor behavior becomes stronger with repeated doses.  I should also note that differences between people who take amphetamine for ADHD and people who take amphetamine recreationally are confounded by the fact that the regularity of dosing, the dose amount, and route of administration are probably different between those two groups.  As I pointed out, the dose and dosing regimen make a huge difference in the effect of the drug."
askscience,3e2t6v,Optrode,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"This is an important question, differenciating the two.    I sure hope it's different... Adderall changed my life for the better and I get depressed remembering what life was like before.  Much of my ADD I experienced as depression, but Adderall (along with structure and self-care) helped more than any SSRI or other that I tried.  I say this to acknowledge I have a dog in the fight, and am therefore somewhat biased due to my own experience.  The thought of potential negative long-term affects from Adderall use is frightening to me primarily because I don't want to return to the old lethargic and ""depressive"" life without it.  Sorry for rambling."
askscience,3e2t6v,NewAccount4Friday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"Hey. I used to take Adderall, it's lovely! It helped me focus/stay alert, get through the day and feel better about myself and easily lose weight. All that said...  It's amphetamine and dextroamphetamine; it's amphetamines. And people diagnosed with attention deficit disorders are not immune to its negative side effects. You can look at the warning labels and pamphlets that come with the controlled medication to get an idea of what negative side effects are typical (hopefully you did this when you first started taking the drug). It's all well documented stuff.  That being said, dose is important. You're taking two kinds of amphetamine in a relatively small dose. You're not taking methamphetamine in as large a dose as can be tolerated, I assume you're not taking 5X your prescribed dose... but you're still taking amphetamines. And people diagnosed with ADD do report negative side effects such as grinding their teeth, experiencing racing/pounding heart, high blood pressure, anxiety, loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia, even hallucinations and disorientation.   Amphetamine may play out slightly differently in the brain of someone with ADD, but people with ADD are not magically immune to the deleterious effects of amphetamine use."

askscience,3e2t6v,VotesThings,0,Tue Jul 21 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Inhibitor is a pretty vague term which can mean a variety of things depending on the context of the target. Most commonly, an inhibitor acts at an enzyme to present the biotransformation of some small molecule or protein. Most psychiatric drugs do not target enzymes, so few are commonly called inhibitors, although when well-known example is MAO Inhibitors, which prevent the breakdown of monoamines.  Now a negative allosteric modulator (or NAM) is a much more specific term that refers to compounds that negatively regulate a receptor while not directly competing with the endogenous ligand. Endogenous ligands, by definition, interact with a receptor at the orthosteric binding site. A drug that mimics this interaction is called an agonist, while a drug that inhibits it is called an antagonist. Examples would be morphine and naloxone for the mu opioid receptor. In contrast NAMs (and positive allosteric modulators, PAMs) act at a different site on the receptor to dampen or enhance ligand-mediated signaling, and thus generally act more subtly and are argued to preserve endogenous temporal resolution. Benzodiazepines act as PAMs at GABA-A, and increase the probability of channel opening when GABA is present. The GABA-NAM, presumably, would do the opposite and dampen GABA signaling. This mode of interaction is advantageous compared to a compound that completely shuts off GABA-A, as such would likely produce seizures and other nasty side effects."

Could you fill in this picture in simple terms? How does the next pump know to fire? What triggers the release of the neurotransmittors in the end?"
askscience,3e2t6v,Catharcissism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but hopefully I can use simple concepts to help!   This process is all summed up as the ""action potential."" Essentially, axons are the polarized, long body of the neuron. Polarized meaning that the inside of the axon is negatively charged while the external environment is positively charged. At the ""top"" of the axon, so to speak, is the soma (cell body) and the dendrites (little fingers that synapse with other neurons). When neurotransmitters travel from the ""pre-synaptic"" neuron to the ""post-synaptic"" neuron, this triggers ion channels to open at the top of the axon. This allows all those positive ions outside the neuron to flow into the axon, making that area of the axon where the channel is positive! If there is enough of a ""depolarization"" as this is called - where enough positive ions flow into the axon to change the voltage of that area from -70mV to +35mV - this will trigger the action potential. (The area that was first depolarized will repolarize/hyperpolarize as the adjacent space depolarizes, I can go into more detail on that if you'd like, but essentially this will always flow in the one direction down the axon because the hyperpolarization prevents the area from becoming positively charged too soon after already firing.) The action potential is essentially the positive charge travelling down the axon to reach the axon terminal, the space housing neurotransmitters that has little fingers at the end of the axon which will synapse with neighbouring neurons. When this positive charge reaches the terminal, the little balls (vescicles) containing the neurotransmitters move toward the membrane of the cell. The neurotransmitters are then released into the synapse (space between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron) and the vescicle remains in the axon terminal, leaving these free-floating neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters will then bind to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron's dendrites! This then triggers the action potential in the post-synaptic neuron, where the electrical potential moves toward the cell body and eventually the axon of that neuron. It continues on from there!   I tried to make this as simple as possible. If I somehow messed something up or something was confusing, please correct me or let me know! I love this stuff :)"

My father has had a meningeal tumor pressuring the motor cortex on his right side, it was the size of big chicken egg. Shortly after the first surgery he unfortunately developed a hemiparesis on his left side. However the wound still bled and again caused a lot of pressure.   A few days later he had another surgery to remove the blood. According to the Neurologist at the hospital he didn't have any actual brain damage. He is recovering pretty fast now (he can walk again with the use of crutches and has regained some strength in his left hand!).   As a student of Neuropsychology I'd like to know how this recovering process manifests itself on a cellular level. In other words, what caused him to have a hemiparesis in the first place and how is he regaining motor skills this fast?"

Many individuals experience anxiety and depression, and SSRIs are the most common medication currently. From personal experience and my studies thus far, it seems like a significant portion of individuals can attribute their anxiety or depression to certain problems/deficits in his or her life, resulting in self medication, whether it be binge eating, recreational drug use or alcoholism, etc. In the instances of these arguably addictive/compulsive behaviours, would it not make sense to instead medicate with regards to dopamine, altering the ""reward system"" so to speak, and therefore tackling the underlying problem? Are there good drugs to approach this, or would it be too complex as dopamine agonists lead to transcription and the effects that dopamine has as a vasopressor and inotropic agent? Is there a way to influence this ""reward system"" in a way that's beneficial for treating certain unhealthy behaviours, as opposed to the effects of opiates, for example, as I'm sure it's a much better idea for someone to be an alcoholic than a heroin addict! (I hope that question made sense, just a mere undergrad with limited neuroscience knowledge but plan to take many more neuro courses in this upcoming year!)  What are the links between autism and epilepsy? I read about certain receptor deficiencies in the brain, specifically creatine receptor deficiency, that produce symptoms of autism as well as frequent seizures. I have also read that epilepsy is commonly found in cases of autism. What differentiates someone with creatine receptor deficiency from someone with autism and epilepsy? Does autism simply come down to a different receptor deficiency, or is it something else entirely while there is no deficiency in creatine receptors? Is all of this on a spectrum?

This causes the next neuron in line to start an action potential (electrical signal) by adjusting the ion flow into (or out of) the neuron using voltages-gated ion channels. This ""electrical"" signal causes the neuron to release more chemicals to the next neuron which causes it to fire and it just keeps going like this.  *This is obviously a very simplified version of this but if you're interested in diving deeper you should be able to find some awesome videos on YouTube that help you visualize this concept."

Here's its info from the wiki page:   The NerveGear's high density microwave transceivers are capable of accessing the user's brain, allowing it to send fake signals to the five senses of the user. The transceivers are not only capable of inducing fake sensory signals, but can also block every movement command from the brain to the body, preventing the player from moving their body while in FullDive to avoid injuries. The transceivers are also capable of blocking sensory information from the body to the brain, thus, while using it, the player is completely insensate to the physical world.While details are never specified, the powerful electromagnet is able to destroy a person's brain, and SAO's operating system has been programmed to do so if the player's hit points are reduced to zero.

Muscles get sore due to eccentric contractions (muscle lengthening; think of a bicep curl....the eccentric part is when the curl is going down). The heart only performs concentric contractions (muscle shortening; think bicep curl again...the concentric part is when the curl is going up).   Eccentric contraction causes small micro-tears to occur in the muscle, otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). This is what gets repaired and how our muscles become larger (hypertrophy). Since our hearts do not encounter eccentric contractions (ever), then our hearts do not become sore.

askscience,3e1eus,Jake_JAM,143,Tue Jul 21 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thanks.  How do bodies get better at cardio? Does the heart just get stronger like any other muscle, or do other improvements also happen?"
askscience,3e1eus,dmorg18,213,Tue Jul 21 12:12:23 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic question, to understand it, it is important to understand how ""Cardio"" is measured.   We typically measure it in what we call VO2 MAX (Volume of Oxygen the body can use maximally). VO2 is calculated as follows using the Fick equation:  VO2 = Q * (A-V) where Q is the cardiac output of the heart, A is the arterial oxygen content, and V is the venous oxygen content. (A-V) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference.   Cardiac output is how much blood the heart is pumping out in Liters/MIN (Cardiac output is heart rate * stroke volume...I wont get that in-depth in this post). Arteriovenous oxygen difference means the difference in the oxygen content of the blood between the arterial blood and the venous blood. I like to tell my students that is basically the measurement of how 'good' the body can use the oxygen in the blood.   So, to improve VO2, we must improve Q and (A-V). It is much easier for our bodies to improve (A-V), than Q. So, after several sessions of ""Cardio"" our bodies will begin to use oxygen better and thus, we improve cardio."
askscience,3e1eus,Jake_JAM,55,Tue Jul 21 12:28:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the great information!   Weird question, if a person were to lose a leg, for example, would the person experience any boost in cardiovascular ability due to their heart and lung capacity staying the same yet their consuming body decreasing?"
askscience,3e1eus,neoikon,42,Tue Jul 21 12:59:50 2015 UTC,"This actually becomes very complex and again goes back to what Jake_JAM was saying in that it really comes down to how you define ""cardiovascular ability.""  For instance, most people talk about VO2max as way to measure the cardiovascular system, but it functions more as a middle man.  That is, a better way to measure someones ability is a term called ""vVO2max"" which means ""velocity at VO2max.""  This basically means how fast you are moving when you reach your VO2max (this could be cycling, running, swimming, etc).  But lets take running and slightly change your example.  Instead of losing a leg lets assume an identical person had no changes to their body but lost 20lbs.  So identical VO2max except in one situations he is 20lbs lighter.  Obviously they are going to be able to run faster so their VO2max is the same but their vVO2max is higher.  This is sort of the introduction to ""running economy"" which means, essentially, how efficient your body is at translating a unit of oxygen into a unit of motion (in running).  Speaking in terms of VO2max, it sounds based on your question you might be under the impression a lower VO2max is better but a higher VO2max is actually indicative of a stronger cardiovascular system (ignoring economy).  Think of it like an engine, a stronger engine can guzzle more gas and you want the strongest engine possible.  Physiological adaptions that can allow you to guzzle more oxygen include things like (but are no limited to) muscle capillarization (increase in capillaries in the muscles to allow better oxygen uptake by muscles from blood due to increased surface area), increased cellular mitochondria density and size (allows your muscles to use more oxygen per unit mass), increased red blood cell density in the blood (able to carry more oxygen from the lungs to the muscles), increased hemoglobin (each blood cell can carry more oxygen), increased lung capacity, increased stroke rate and volume of your heart, the list goes on."

If we don't exercise regularly, our body has no need to give provide the muscles with extra oxygen, nutrients, etc. our muscles then become smaller (due to the body being able to maintain a smaller mass easier), and the need for the extra oxygen and nutrients isn't there.

What is actually happening is adaptations that facilitate the cardiovascular system decaying at different rates.  I'm not 100% sure of the various rates of build/decay of adaptations (this is actually on ongoing area of research) but the basic idea is that you can have two adaptations, A and B, which could be built up after training for a long time.  If you then stopped training for a month, adaptation A might be completely gone after a month but adaptation B might have just started to decay and so if you were to resume training it would take less time to attain your previous level of fitness."

askscience,3e1eus,Jake_JAM,3,Tue Jul 21 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"Which is why eating or drinking can be very difficult during exercise, and overeating/drinking can end up leading to very painful intestinal issues.  Normally when you eat food your body diverts blood to the stomach to start digestion (which is often why you feel drowsy after eating a big meal--all the blood going to your stomach).  During exercise you are essentially forcing the body to choose between sending blood to the stomach to help digestion or to use it mostly to carry oxygen and dissipate heat (send blood to the skin).  Balancing water/electrolyte/calorie absorption during exercise thus becomes a very difficult and important issue especially for endurance athletes as eating or drinking too much can easily lead to them not finishing an event."
askscience,3e1eus,Birdman10687,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:43 2015 UTC,Wouldn't drowsiness/food coma be more attributed to the release of insulin after a big meal?  I can't imagine the stomach takes that much blood away from other systems.
askscience,3e1eus,Blatblatblat,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:05 2015 UTC,I am just a student so correct me if I am wrong but I think going a tad further in depth regarding cardiac output might be of benefit to this conversation in that one of the adaptations that occurs with exercise is an increase in stroke volume due to the strengthening of the ventricular walls (more blood pushed through with each beat of the heart) which leads to a decreased demand on the heart (improved efficiency? via not having to beat as many times while still circulating the same amount of blood). This improved efficiency is why athletes like Lance Armstrong had resting heart rates in the low 30 bpm range.

They didn't necessarily train up their vo2max levels from normal to elite, they initially (through genetics) had an unusually high vo2max to start with, but undoubtedly they did increase it with training.

It might be more accurate to say that they are ""incomplete""     Yes eccentric contractions do result in the most damage/soreness but they are not a pre-requisite for pain/soreness, per se.   Generally speaking,  inflammation is the direct precursor of ""soreness"" and results from both eccentric or concentric contractions.  As far as my qualifications, I have a PhD in Biochemistry and I received postdoctoral training in Immunology (studying inflammation) and I currently have 8 published peer reviewed articles in both of those fields (with more coming out shortly)."

My apologies for being a little harsh. I'm going to edit my original post - you'll get the credit! Thanks!  Yes, inflammation is a precursor of ""soreness"" and does result from both eccentric and concentric contractions, however it has been my experience that eccentric contraction is what really causes DOMS effects. By that, I mean anything that can impair force production (or performance in anyway you wish to measure it). As it has been suggested that multiple bouts of concentric exercise will not decrease performance significantly, due to little muscle damage (i.e. DOMS), when compared to eccentric exercise.   See: Talag, Trinidad S. ""Residual muscular soreness as influenced by concentric, eccentric, and static contractions."" Research Quarterly. American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation 44.4 (1973): 458-469.  With that said, I am not an inflammation expert by any means. I primarily deal with muscle fibers & motoneurons, and their effects on force production. Thus, I am biased to believe your insight on inflammation. Thinking on it a little bit, we are both probably correct in the grand scheme of things. I believe that the cause of amount of soreness (DOMS) greatly depends on the specific activity, contraction type/intensity, and overall conditioning (fitness level) of the subject."

Any other thing i said, for example DOM's not causing internal bleeding (DOM's is a symptom, precipitated by the intracellular contents bursting from cells; call it what you will), is mincing words. Pain can radiate from any number of sites along the spine and neck to, for example, the chest (I should have been clearer on that one). It can also cause the receptors in nerve endings to perceive 'pain' in the direct channels via chemicals. Someone who has perceived pain in the pectoral muscle, for example, can actually have a completely unrelated issue in the muscles around the Occipital nerve (Anecdote - that happened to me personally. I laid on one of those back-elongating devices years ago when those were 'fad'. It stretched out all the wrong muscles at the base of my head/neck).

I haven't seen any studies that tease out precisely whether metabolic distress or time under tension is the stronger variable but generally speaking when you increase total training volume you will increase both metabolic distress and time under tension. That being said that's a broad generalization and it's possible to achieve high training volume with little fatigue/ distress (long training sessions or several short sessions throughout the day) and possible to achieve extreme fatigue without significant time under tension (cycle sprinting or something like that). My personal hypothesis (backed up by the literature) is not that it's one or the other, but an optimal interaction between the two that leads to the most hypertrophy."

askscience,3e1eus,Gpbroseph,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"that's a complicated question.  first off, micro tearing your muscles probably isn't the primary mechanism of hypertrophy. I linked this article in another comment and it's a comprehensive literature review on hypertrophy. The author thinks hypertrophy is probably accomplished mostly by a combination of time under tension and metabolic distress.  creatine increases muscle volume by two mechanisms. The primary mechanism is that it causes a net increase in cell volume. Your body likes to maintain homeostasis. Creatine supplementation causes an increased proportion of phosphorylated creatine (PCr) in your cell so your body basically takes in a bit more water to maintain the same ratio of solute to solvent. This is why creatine usage causes water retention.  THe secondary mechanism is that creatine increases the function of a primary anaerobic pathway which will increase how much time under tension you can apply and increase the amount of metabolic distress you can cause which is how it increases hypertrophy.  So Creatine causes increased muscle volume by 1) increasing water retention and 2) causing an increase in the processes that lead to hypertrophy."

The proximal cause of expression of genes for myofibrillar proteins is NOT microtears, but muscle fatigue. The mediating substances are not known. Microtears in muscle fibers occur during excessive exertion (which may be associated with muscle fatigue) largely near or at myotendonus junctions. At those sites, leakage of K+ causes acute pain, but in post exercise myalgia inflammatory processes including macrophage cleanup and lymphokine secretion occurs.

Gait in general is a process accomplished through eccentric muscle control to counter ground reaction forces on impact and using gravity to move your body forward. Walking and running are often described as controlled falling. While this is a bit simplistic, it is, at least in principal, accurate.  Every time you make contact with the ground you have eccentric contractions to absorb the force of your foot hitting the ground. Running has a more concentric component than walking due to increased speed, but running is HIGHLY eccentric, the range of motion of the eccentric contractions is just very small.   This is, however, why cycling tends to cause less soreness than running. Cycling has almost zero eccentric component, but even then if you induce a high metabolic demand that causes the accumulation of a lot of metabolites you could still be sore.  Eccentric contractions are probably one of the main contributors to muscle soreness, but my understanding is they are far from the only contribution."

askscience,3e1eus,MapsAreCool,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Not only does it not pass the gut check, this study suggests otherwise.   The purpose of this two-part study was to determine whether the amount of exercise-induced muscle soreness differs between subjects who perform concentric and eccentric isokinetic contractions of their quadriceps femoris muscles. In experiment 1, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised at the same power level. In experiment 2, subjects were randomly assigned to either an eccentric or a concentric exercise group and both groups exercised with maximal effort. Muscle soreness ratings, obtained by using a visual analogue scale, were taken immediately before exercise and at 24 and 48 hours postexercise. Changes in muscle soreness ratings between exercise groups from preexercise to postexercise periods were compared in both experiments, using a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance. There was no difference in the change in muscle soreness from preexercise to post-exercise periods between groups exercising at equal power levels. Subjects who exercised using eccentric contractions with maximal effort demonstrated greater increases in muscle soreness than those who performed concentric contractions. The results suggest that exercise intensity, rather than contraction type, may be the dependent factor in producing exercise-induced muscle soreness."

Some sort of ""soreness"" is necessary for an adaptive response to training which typically occurs on a 1-2 month timescale: http://www.practicallyscience.com/how-fast-do-i-gainlose-fitness/  As best I can figure, the ""shortness of breath"" one experience in the days after hard running is the cardiac equivalent of skeletal muscle soreness.  Also, the limiting factor is not always BOTH cardiac and skeletal but can be one or the other.  For example:   If you're sick and it is harder to breath your heart will be extra stressed (limiting) (trying to make up the oxygen transport) but your leg muscles will likely feel file If your legs are sore and you run a race you're leg muscles will be extra stressed (limiting)* but your breathing/heart will probably feel fine"

Basically there's more than one type of muscle tissue in your body. There's Skeletal, Smooth and Cardiac. They're differentiated in a few different ways such as striated muscles, voluntary and involuntary control(you don't need to think to digest food or make your heart beat, it's involuntary), etc. In cardiac muscle, the type that your heart is made of, there's a much higher density of mitochondria than in your skeletal muscle. The first paragraph of the introduction on page two gives a good intro in to mitochondria and its effect on muscle. I don't have a source for the exact figures on the difference in density between skeletal and cardiac muscle so I won't guess an exact figure, but I believe it was pretty extreme; in the area of multiple time the density of your skeletal muscle.   TL;DR: Your heart has more mitochondria in it than other muscle which makes it much more fatigue resistant than other muscle in your body."

askscience,3e0fu7,alarumba,231,Tue Jul 21 09:27:22 2015 UTC,Features of extant animals often evolve in an ancestor which lived in a very different environment.  Possibly the very distant ancestor of armadillos lived in an environment which was unfavourable for large litters (not too much food perhaps). So it evolved an implantation site which ensured only a single offspring per-litter.  Over geologic and evolutionary time some more recent armadillo ancestors came to live in a more abundant environment. Evolutionary pressures now favour large litters but our proto-armadillo is stuck with a small zygote implantation site. So over time it evolves this 'additional' splitting mechanism instead.  What this illustrates is that evolution is much better at adapting the structures that it already has to work with than it is in ret-conning things that have already evolved.  NB: It may not have literally worked this way but hopefully you get the gist.  Edit: Often things that might look mal-adaptive today may have been super useful in some other environment and to understand why animals display certain adaptations you often need to think about what those other environments might have been like.

Most of the time, these lead to absolutely nothing; sometimes they're detrimental. A small number of them are advantageous.  The organism itself means nothing, in terms of evolution. Animals that exist today are collections of genes that survived. One of my biggest pet peeves with the way that science is taught, especially to students who aren't going to pursue a career in science, is anthropomorphization.  We need to start teaching kids from a young age that there's no Evolution God watching over organisms and optimizing their genetic makeup. Similarly, I'm annoyed when people say things like ""electrons want to be at their lowest energy level."" No, they don't. Electrons don't ""want"" anything. It's symptomatic of the pre-modern thinking that's unfortunately prevalent in American society."

askscience,3e0fu7,FrancisKey,3,Tue Jul 21 09:55:29 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, ever since the beginning of the universe, one of the natural tenancies of open systems (physics definition) is they tend to expel entropy into the environment. By that, I mean they will collapse possible states by releasing highly entropic energy (heat) into the environment. This process isn't controlled by any kind of decision. It just happens. This tendency has caused the formation of hydrogen atoms, the formation of stars, the formation of heavier elements through fusion and supernovae. It caused the first cells and RNA molecules, it caused the beginning of life, it drives evolution, which just so happened to result in humans, among vast numbers of other species. It caused our ability and desire to invent tools and language and build environment controlled shelters, it's why we have computers and the internet. I think that people thinking that we are somehow different to the rest of reality, that we are in it but not of it, is truly conceited. I think the same physical tendencies that formed reality also formed us, and that it doesn't make sense that we would be different. I think that a very simple rule, ""open systems tend to expel entropy into the environment"", combined with itself endlessly in an unimaginably complex system is absolutely capable of generating the entirety of the reality we see around us. Trying to anthropomorphize any of reality, even things that are already ""human"" is an incorrect way of modeling reality."

As I understand, fitness is the ability for an organism to pass on its genome and then have the F1 pass their genome on as well. Since there is 4 progeny, it quadruple (relatively speaking) the chance of that genome getting passed on."
askscience,3e0fu7,Steve4964,2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:23 2015 UTC,"Basically. Keep in mind that much like organisms, genes themselves are also in competition with each other to reproduce. It's often claimed that genes are selected for based on how much they benefit the organism, but this isn't strictly true. It would be more accurate to say that ""genes are passed on based on how good they are at getting themselves passed on."" Most of the time, this requires the gene to be in some way beneficial to the organism, but this is not the only case.  Ever wonder why most disease-causing genes are recessive? Because being recessive allows the bad gene to be present in the organism without significantly harming it, and thus get itself passed on to that organism's offspring.  Back to your armadillo example: whatever sequence of genes is responsible for identical quads, that sequence is very common in armadillos because it is far better at passing along copies of itself than any harm it may cause by not ""enhancing genetic diversity."" Genes don't care about diversity, they just want to be copied as many times as possible. The title of Richard Dawkins' famous book The Selfish Gene is in reference to this concept.  Note: I should clarify that genes don't strictly ""want"" anything, since they're nothing more than complex molecules. We can't really ascribe goals to inanimate objects, but the fact of the matter is that genes that are better at getting copied end up being more prevalent in any given population."

askscience,3e0fu7,vanilla_thunder34,2,Tue Jul 21 08:20:04 2015 UTC,"It's hard to pick examples of useless adaptations that became widespread, especially if by ""useless"" you mean that it never served any sort of useful function at any point. Adaptations like that are usually eliminated before they get too common in the gene pool.  Somebody already linked you to vestigiality, which is an example of when a formerly-useful trait became useless due to another change in physiology or environment. Oftentimes, the trait becomes minimized over time as the pressures that used to promote it are no longer present. In humans, an example would be the coccyx (tailbone). When we left the trees to walk on the ground, and especially when we became bipedal, there was no advantage in having a tail anymore, and it was just extra biomass that required energy to maintain and was maybe even a liability when running from predators. Thus, over generations, the tail shrunk to the point where you can't even see it without an x-ray.  There is also sometimes tradeoff between obvious advantages and subtle ones. For instance, take the fiddler crab or the peacock. Neither the crab's giant claw nor the peacock's enormous plumage serve any direct function for survival; in fact, they're usually detrimental, since they're also excessively large, and take extra resources to maintain. However, in both species, this seemingly extravagant and ""useless"" adaptation plays a role in courtship, and can increase their likelihood of finding a viable mate. Thus, the evolutionary pressures from natural selection and sexual selection reach an equilibrium that promotes seemingly ""useless"" adaptations like those mentioned above."

askscience,3e2u4c,Oli-Baba,27,Tue Jul 21 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's accurate to say that a mirror will be subjected to a deformation when a beam of light is applied. The reason is that photons have a finite momentum, and because the mirror changes the direction of travel (and hence the momentum) of the photons in the original beam, it itself must experience a change of momentum (due to the conservation of momentum). By Newton's second law, we can express this change in momentum as a function of time as a force: F = dp/dt. This so-called radiative force in turn will in turn produce a pressure on the area of the mirror that it impinges on. As an aside, this is the exact scheme that could be used to power spacecraft in space using the light of celestial bodies via solar sails.  In other words, the mirror will be slightly bent in the region over which the beam hits it because of the resulting radiation pressure. However, since this pressure is relatively low (because the momentum carried by photons is relatively small), the mirror will usually not be permanently altered by the beam and will return to its equilibrium position once the beam is removed (this is called an elastic deformation in the language of engineering)."

askscience,3e2w6v,FuriousGeorge5726,14,Tue Jul 21 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"I worked for a MRI lab recently, we used 3T models for research purposes (hospitals generally use 1.5T models for patient procedures, anything higher is usually reserved for research purposes). The book we were given stated all of the usual safety guidelines and FDA stuff, besides that, there was a section about tissue heating which I'll just copy and paste here, might answer some of you questions:    2) Exposure to the RF field causes tissue heating: The Radio Frequency (RF) fields used in MRI are non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation, and so do not pose the same type of risks as x-rays and radioactive tracer techniques. However, the RF fields do cause tissue heating. The FDA guideline is that there is no significant risk if the specific absorption rate (SAR) is:   a. Less than 4 W/kg whole body for 15 minutes, b. Less than 3 W/kg averaged over the head for 10 minutes, c. Less than 8 W/kg in any gram of tissue in the head or torso for 15 minutes, or d. Less than 12 W/kg in any gram of tissue in the extremities for 15 minutes.    Additionally, (for MRI's anyways, because of the shifting magnetic fields) there can be peripheral nerve stimulation. Again copy and paste:    3) Exposure to rapidly switched magnetic fields can produce nerve stimulation: The gradient coils used for imaging produce time-varying magnetic fields (slew rate in dB/dt). Such fields, if sufficiently strong, can produce peripheral nerve stimulation. Stimulation can occur in peripheral nerves, muscle, and blood vessels. The FDA guideline is that switched gradient fields pose a significant risk if dB/dt is sufficient to produce severe discomfort or painful stimulation. The mean pain nerve stimulation threshold, the level at which half of subjects are likely to report painful stimulation, is 90 Tesla/Second. The mean peripheral nerve stimulation threshold, the level at which 50% of subjects might report a tactile sensation or metallic taste is 60 Tesla/Second.  However, these cases are for MRI's where the magnetic fields are being manipulated, I give this answer because I imagine you're asking this question because you are working with or in close proximity to National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's 45T Hybrid Magnet or the likes of. Having been inside of a 3T scanner myself and felt the PN stimulation, I can tell you that twitchy feeling will be stronger as the magnet's strength increases (again, when the fields are being manipulated). Simply standing next to a passive magnetic field (3T) has no recorded risks whatsoever, usually any harm caused is related to a metal object being brought within proximity of the magnet.  Doing a cursory search on the average amount of ferrous in the human body, roughly 4-5g of iron is present in an adult (Wikipedia) which is spread throughout the body in the form of minute particles.  Which then changes the question to, how much ferrous is too much while in proximity to the 45T magnet?  Again, this answer is based off of my work with 3T MRI Scanners, I imagine calling up and asking the safety coordinator at NHMFL (Kyle Orth -8506453205 or Colleen Davis -8506450777) would give you a more satisfy and definitive answer."

From NASA:   The trouble is that the Sun is very noisy at radio wavelengths, which would make it very difficult to tune into the radio telemetry from the spacecraft. By putting it into a halo orbit, we can place it so that it's always a few degrees away from the Sun, making radio reception much easier.    So no, a relay satellite isn't needed, but we do avoid trying to separate a signal from the noise of the Sun.  A satellite stationed at L3, directly opposite the Sun, would be much harder to communicate with. However, this point isn't very stable, and there's no major benefit to collecting data here, so we don't have anything in L3."

askscience,3e2gjs,paulHarkonen,-12,Tue Jul 21 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way, the sun broadcasts a fixed (relatively) quantity of radiation across a broad spectrum.  EM radiation is additive, meaning if you have two signals broadcasting at the exact same frequency, they come in together at that frequency but twice as loud.  That means that as long as your satellite is able to broadcast on a frequency where it is fairly ""loud"" compared to the sun, you can listen on that frequency, ignore the constant background noise of ""sun"" and only listen to the sat.  It doesn't mean you have to be ""louder"" than the sun just ""loud"" enough that the fluctuations from your transmission are distinct compared to the normal solar fluctuations.  Think of it like talking next to a loud street.  Your brain knows that the street is noise and the voice is what matters, so it filters it.  I don't know that this is how DSCOVR is communicating, but it is certainly possible to broadcast ""louder"" than the sun at specific frequencies, and then filter the solar noise out.  The other option (if the sat can't get ""loud"" enough) is to bounce the communications off other listening satellites that aren't in the direct path of the sun.  This allows your signal to be slightly angled compared to the sun and would allow you to only listen to signals coming from the L1 point and not hear the sun at all.  It would be much more complex from a mission and equipment design perspective (since you would have a very limited angle) but is also doable if for some reason you can't get a high enough gain off the L1 antenna."

Looking at the Wikipedia page, we can see that the bomb consisted of a fission bomb (something that breaks up an atom - such as uranium) as well as a fusion bomb (the wiki page refers to the bomb as a 'lithium' bomb, so I assume it was lithium that was fussed). When a heavy element is broken down, the mass which is lost comes from the energy involved in the bonding of the protons and neutrons. Ie, there are no chemical bonds breaking, the bonds between what the atoms consist of is what's broken. This is a huge amount of energy, this energy is large enough that it contributes to the atoms mass, and so when the energy is released the mass goes down a little bit."

Relativity says that the inertia of a system is determined by its total internal energy.   When you perform a transformation (chemical, nuclear, anything) and move the produced energy out of the system, the internal energy was decreased. So if the above is to be trusted, your system will literally weigh less.  In the reaction happening in a nuclear bomb (ignoring neutron radiation), the number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is conserved. It's the same number, count them.   Mass is not ""converted"" into energy. Nuclear binding energy in the nuclei is developed as heat; if this heat is then removed from the system, the system will weigh less than before. But there was no change in the matter content, no destruction or creation of protons took place. Simply, the greater binding energy contributed to the fissile material before the reaction by making it weigh slightly more than after.  read SR1"

askscience,3e2a9q,mrmidjji,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"If we wait until all the neutrons decay, then dissipate the resulting heat, we'll have to add the neutron decay energy to the mass count.

Their half-life is massive compared to the total reaction time. Absolutely gigantic. Moreover, a neutron decay yields around 700 keV, while hydrogen fusion if I recall correctly is around 20 MeV. So the number of neutrons decayed is insignificant, and the energy from neutron decay is absolutely abismal.  But still, even if you do count those, what I said still applies with the clear caveat that you have to factor those decays in.   I'm also curious if any type of particle created in the explosion might stimulate neutron decay?

This is actually how every nuclear reaction, from Tsar Bomba to power reactors, produce energy.  In nuclear reactions, a very small portion of the mass of the particles involved is converted into energy. The mechanism is a bit complicated, but it's ultimately due to the fact that some of an atom's mass already exists in the form of the nucleus' binding energy; 2 protons and 2 neutrons actually weighs slightly more than a He-4 nucleus. It can be visualized like this. Any reaction that takes particles from one part of the curve and ends up with particles that are higher on the y-axis have effectively turned mass into energy: fission of U-235 into any pair of lighter nuclei produces energy, just as fusion of H-2 into He-4 does.   There's actually a nifty little site that talks about what this means for nuclear weapons, a term called yield-to-weight ratio. Fusion is actually much more efficient at converting matter into energy than fission is, and Tsar Bomba could have been a much larger weapon had it been designed to use its fusion fuel more efficiently."

The current working hypothesis is now based on one or a series of gravitational near-misses that produced enough tidal torque to tile the planet.

askscience,3dxutn,Squishumz,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"No matter what speed an object is moving in the X direction, it has absolutely no effect on any force in the y direction, correct?  That's because it has three different inertia values, all of which are orthogonal.    I didn't think that this was true of angular velocity.  A spinning ball has only one moment of inertia, so if it's spinning east to west, any force trying to spin it north to south will be acting against the east-west inertia, thus they are not orthogonal.    Or maybe I'm just confused as to what ""orthogonal"" means.  I thought it meant completely independent from, and having no effect one way or the other."
askscience,3dxutn,_PM_ME_YOUR_SMILE,5,Mon Jul 20 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"There is a single angular velocity vector which can be projected onto three orthogonal axes called the principal axes of an object. It is incorrect to say that an object has a single moment of inertia because moment of inertia is defined with respect to a certain axis. Since you can draw an infinite amount of lines through a given point (i.e. the object's center of mass), the object has uncountably many moments of inertia. The moments of inertia about the principal axes are called the principle moments, and rotation is much easier to describe using these axes and their principal moments. Thus, people typically talk about an object having three moments of inertia in orthogonal directions.  In the case of a spinning ball, the ball is isotropic so that the moment of inertia is the same about any axis through its center of mass. This is not true of all objects. A thin disk, for example, has moments of inertia (1/2) MR2 about an axis perpendicular to its surface and (1/4) MR2 about any two perpendicular axes parallel to the surface. This is why it is easier to spin a coin on its edge than to spin it on its surface."
askscience,3dxutn,catvender,5,Mon Jul 20 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, angular momentum has to be represented as a pseudovector rather than a regular vector. Treating the cross product as a vector is just a simplification."
askscience,3dxutn,popisfizzy,6,Mon Jul 20 23:27:27 2015 UTC,I have seen this effect with gyroscopes. Tap it in the right spot and it will flip 180 while still spinning full speed. It might actually gain a little speed from the tap.
askscience,3dxutn,DorkJedi,5,Mon Jul 20 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"How do you 'flip' a planet, though? It seems like you'd have to impart spin to do so.   Yes   Since the different spins are orthogonal, wouldn't that require completely cancelling your angular momentum in one direction, while adding to it in the other?   In the case of Venus, yes.  In the case of Uranus, not necessarily.  To be absolutely exactly 90 degrees, you would, but Uranus isn't like that.  It's entirely possible that Uranus had some of it's prograde angular momentum cancelled in the collision, but equally possible that it just got a LOT MORE of the orthogonal angular momentum added, so much so that the original, unchanged prograde angular momentum seems small by comparison (""seems small by comparison"" is the ""almost"" in ""almost 90 degrees"".)  As you say, the spins are orthogonal.  Thus, you can add or subtract angular momentum in the X and Y directions without impacting the extant prograde angular momentum in the Z direction.  Just like linear momentum."
askscience,3dxutn,garrettj100,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:13 2015 UTC,Good point. I was only considering exactly 90 degrees. Too much time spent doing computer stuff tends to make you forget the real world doesn't work in 'nice' angles.
askscience,3dxutn,Squishumz,2,Mon Jul 20 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"What if it's not flipped? What if it entered the system with an energy such that this is how it settled? Or is still in the process of settling? These natural forces of the system that force the system to all conform, could just be so relatively small compared to the original state of the planet(s). Or any number of events, large or small could have added to the results we now observe. I think for all we know, Venus bounced off of Triton. Or maybe I'm just pulling this out of Uranus."
askscience,3dxutn,RaptorPrime,56,Mon Jul 20 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Actually the fact that these are physically equivalent, in terms of required energy, is the best way I know to explain gyroscopic stability.

askscience,3dxutn,Olclops,13,Tue Jul 21 01:06:08 2015 UTC,The thing is though wouldn't flipping it have to be two separate actions? First you have to add momentum to start it flipping and then you have to hit it in the opposite direction to stop it.
askscience,3dxutn,PlacidPlatypus,22,Mon Jul 20 18:28:37 2015 UTC,Wouldn't conservation of angular momentum mean that reversing rotation requires the same energy as flipping (while preserving rotation speed)?
askscience,3dxutn,gpunotpsu,8,Mon Jul 20 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"Changing the plane of rotation requires sqrt(2) times the energy needed to get it rotating at all.  You have to null the rotation in the original plane, and create rotation in the new plane.  Remember, this is space, so there isn't anything to push against to spin it around.  The calculation is the same as those for plane-change maneuvers for spacecraft.  90 degree inclination changes require sqrt(2) times the delta-v of the orbital velocity."

Beyond that these embryos grow into planets by smashing in to each other.  Venus isn't the only inner planet that shows signs of such collisions.  Mercury's mantle and crust are badly depleted in material for an object its size, and that's thought to be from such a collision.  Our own Moon is the relic of a collision between the Earth and a roughly Mars sized objects.

askscience,3dxutn,nothing_clever,7,Mon Jul 20 19:04:54 2015 UTC,Poles don't have much to do with rotational axis of the planet.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal.  Our north has only been north for on the order of 50k years.  It has flipped and gone all wibby-wobbly (highly technical terms...  I know) before.  That's a lie...  I'm sure the rotational axis has some relationship to the magnetic poles - they don't form randomly.  But it's not a fixed relationship like you may think it is.

askscience,3dxutn,Kwintty7,11,Tue Jul 21 00:49:32 2015 UTC,"The same argument explains why most rotating systems like the Solar system tend to flatten out into discs.  All the ""vertical"" (relative to the plane of rotation of the system's total angular momentum) moving particles in a cloud will cancel each other out over time through collisions, which compacts the system's mass into a disc and can speed up the rotation.  This compaction and increase in orbital speed accelerates the rate at which bodies in retrograde orbit are eventually neutralized through even more collisions.  If we treat this system as closed, the total angular momentum must be conserved, so given enough time, a single common direction of rotation will prevail."
askscience,3dxutn,DiamondIceNS,5,Mon Jul 20 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"It's even more basic than that.  If an object is ""above"" the plane, there will be a ""downward"" gravitational force toward the disk as each of the objects in the disk attracts it.  Similarly, if an object is ""below"" the plane, there will be a gravitational pull ""upward"" towards the disk."
askscience,3dxutn,The_camperdave,3,Mon Jul 20 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"That force you describe only suffices to keep the cloud held together.  If a body was traveling up relative to the plane of rotation, well, gravity will accelerate it to a stop and pull it back to the disc, but once it gets to the disc, it is now traveling at a high velocity and will zip right past.  The body will fly below the disc, until gravity pulls it back up to the disc, and it will fly back up, and back down, and back up, in a cycle.  Until it hits something.  It's generally the collisions that actually cancel out that vertical momentum."

After that, it's constantly slowing down due to friction and air resistance. The angular velocity is slowest at the start, and increases as it goes. It takes far longer to go around the funnel at the start than at the end.   If you could speed up the coin when it was near the bottom of the well, the coin would end up in a higher orbit, which would give it a higher linear velocity and a lower angular velocity.

The interesting aspect of this result is that it doesn't matter where in the hollow sphere you are. Whether you're exactly in the center or near the edge doesn't matter, the net gravity force experienced is always zero.  Intuitively, this can be understood by considering that while being close to an edge, the gravitational pull from the material near you is rather high, but there is so much more material pulling you the other way, that the net force is zero. Gauss's Law and the Shell Theorem put this intuition into mathematical context.  Note that one assumption was made that was not explicitly mentioned and that is that the mass of the surface of the sphere is distributed evenly. Or more precisely: The mass should be distributed in a spherically symmetric way. If 90% of the mass would be located in the left hemisphere and the remaining 10% in the right, the story above does not hold."

It is unlikely for any given system to be like this, but the farther out we look the more stars there are within a certain radius, so the greater the chance of a system having a favourable chance of alignment. There is no specific reason why the closest star system would happen to have that alignment.  There is possibly an exoplanet around one of the Alpha Centauri stars, but the detection is unclear and controversial. Because the two Alpha Centauri stars are too close to each other in the sky right now to verify the detection, we'll have to wait a few more years."

I can see how it'd be simpler to tell with an aligned plane since you only have to check x or xy axis motion at trillions of miles away. If xy can still be measured at that distance, I'd figure that a non-aligned star's motion on a z axis could still be negligible. What's fudging their results?"
askscience,3e26uu,RapingTheWilling,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:08 2015 UTC,"The Kepler mission, which is the most prolific finder of exoplanets, looks for a dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it. This only works if the planet's orbit takes it between the star and the Earth. The  other principle method relies on looking at changes in the velocity of the star due to the gravitational pull of the planet (via the Doppler effect), but we can only detect changes in velocity in the direction of the Earth, so the planet has to be pulling it in that direction.  There are methods that don't require this alignment but they are a lot less sensitive."
askscience,3e26uu,iorgfeflkd,9,Tue Jul 21 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"Our exoplanet detection systems can only pickup planets with certain parameters.  We can't directly observe the planets from that distance,  so instead planets are detected by their effects on the stars light as it passes between its star and the Earth.  However, this only works if the solar system's orbital plane is oriented in such a way that the star planet's orbit passes in front of the star from our view.  For instance, it could be 90 degrees to us,and the planet would circle the start from our perspective, thereby never passing in front of it and never affecting the stars light.  In addition, there are further restrictions:  -the size of the planet: too small and it won't affect the stars light enough when it passes in front of it)  -orbital distance: too far away and it won't affect the light enough to notice it  -year length:  we need a few transits to confirm it is actually a planet.  If an exoplanet had a Jupiter clone with a year equivalent 12 Earth years, we'd have to watch it for up to 12 years to catch a transit, and then wait another 12 years to see if it repeats to make sure the dimming wasn't a fluke.  The odds of an exoplanet meeting all these criteria aren't super high, so chances are Alpha Centauri doesn't meet all these criteria.  Instead we survey lots and lots of solar systems knowing that some small subset of them will meet all these criteria and we'll be able to spot a planet."

Usually, the star's mass dominates so much that this point is located within the star's radius, so the star's orbit is more of a wobble. Nevertheless, this wobble can sometimes be detected by measuring the doppler shift of star's spectral lines.  This is the method that was used in the detection of Alpha Centauri Bb. The reason that there exists considerable uncertainty about this detection is that the planet is very small, and so the wobble of the star is very tiny. With such a weak signal, combined with lots of statistical noise, many scientists are skeptical that we're actually seeing anything at all.  The reason we can have confident detections of planets in systems that are thousands of light years away is because the distance doesn't affect the results very much. We're measuring the amount by which the star's spectral lines are doppler shifted, and the distance won't affect this; it is primarily a function of the planet's mass, orbital radius, and orbital inclination. So long as we have a very large planet, it can be very far away and still be easily detected because it produces a large and easily measured wobble in its host star."

askscience,3e36lj,WildZontar,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"I don't study the evolution of plant morphology, but here's my attempt to explain.  Selection acts on existing variation in the population. Those plants which produce leaves that perform better are able to produce more offspring.  Dark colored leaves collect more light, but produce more heat so there needs to be balance there.  Leaves with large surface area collect more light but leak more moisture, so in dry climates plants compensate by decreasing surface area and/or producing a waxy film. These have the cost of either reducing amount of light the leaf collects or reduces the leaves ability to respire.  Producing toxins which make leaves distasteful requires resources that otherwise could be used for growing or producing seeds.  Notice the veins on a leaf. Larger leaves tend to be lanceolate because this reduces the distance from the edge of the leaf to the primary veins, so transport of nutrients through the whole leaf is more efficient. To achieve the same efficiency in a spatulate one requires more veins. I would imagine that the shape a leaf ends up with tends mostly to do with which increases first; surface area or the vascular system of the leaf. The former producing lanceoloate leaves (since extra surface area which is ineffectively used will cost more than it benefits), with the latter producing spatulate ones (since maximizing the surface area relative to perimeter is achieved via a rounded shape)."

askscience,3e1wy9,RRautamaa,9,Tue Jul 21 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"See this article from 2011.  The following excerpt describes what I found to be a particularly interesting example:   Unlike English, the Kuuk Thaayorre language spoken in Pormpuraaw does not use relative spatial terms such as left and right. Rather Kuuk Thaayorre speakers talk in terms of absolute cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, and so forth). Of course, in English we also use cardinal direction terms but only for large spatial scales. We would not say, for example, “They set the salad forks southeast of the dinner forks—the philistines!” But in Kuuk Thaayorre cardinal directions are used at all scales. This means one ends up saying things like “the cup is southeast of the plate” or “the boy standing to the south of Mary is my brother.” In Pormpuraaw, one must always stay oriented, just to be able to speak properly.  Moreover, groundbreaking work conducted by Stephen C. Levinson of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and John B. Haviland of the University of California, San Diego, over the past two decades has demonstrated that people who speak languages that rely on absolute directions are remarkably good at keeping track of where they are, even in unfamiliar landscapes or inside unfamiliar buildings. They do this better than folks who live in the same environments but do not speak such languages and in fact better than scientists thought humans ever could.

That would indicate it's not acceptable in Japanese culture to openly express disagreement, and that the same result (final outcome) must be achieved by other, indirect means that do not depend on language itself.

However, if you show them a green apple, or a green light at an intersection, they will call it 青い (aoi) meaning blue.

Having learned a different language at a native level, I can attribute to your discussion that there are a few potential aspects that can support this argument.  1.) Language Syntax/Vocabulary - each language (and more specifically each country) has its own slang and idioms. As an example, in Chile there is one word which is used in an impressive variety of manners. Different forms/conjugations aside, this word can be used to express a person as being a friend, an enemy, an annoyance, an unknown person, an acquaintance, etc. It is also used as a vague reference for objects and actions (similar to ""that thing"" in English). This isn't common in other Spanish-speaking countries, and so Chile is known as having a ""difficult"" Spanish due to a word being widely used by everybody to describe nearly anything in nearly any situation. This requires the people here to rely upon context much more than other dialects of Spanish which simply use the specific word. As far as applying this to understanding the world, knowing the Chilean culture quite well (8 years living here) they draw many conclusions and generalize nearly everything as compared to my experience living in the US. Great belief in stereotypes (although that isn't unique to Chile), but a surprising lack of racism given the former. It's a difficult concept to explain, perhaps because I don't 100% understand it myself, but the general behavior of the people reflects what I wrote above.  2.) Culture - It is nearly impossible to separate language from culture. It is an integral part of culture, which as we know also shapes how one views and understands the world. Things considered as normal in one culture are completely unacceptable in another and vice versa. This isn't to say that the language is exclusively responsible for these views, but to say that it doesn't play a role isn't quite right either.  Hope this makes sense to you and can help you with your question."

askscience,3e27vk,MfgLuckbot,9,Tue Jul 21 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, in general charging a metallic object will introduce an internal electrostatic repulsion that will in part offset the binding energy of the material and reduce its stability. Provided that the charging is slow enough and that it is distributed over a large enough object, such that the local charge density never becomes too high, then the object can stay intact and will slowly re-neutralize over time by soaking up electrons (in the case of positive charging) from the surrounding medium. However, if the charging is very fast and targeted to a small area, then a phenomenon called Coulomb explosion can occur. The name of the effect pretty much speaks for itself, but the idea is that if you have a metallic cluster and you drain a large chunk of its electrons, then the resulting electrostatic repulsion can cause the cluster to blow up into an ionized plasma as shown in this animation, where the smaller spheres represent electrons and the larger ones ions.  As an interesting tangent, Coulomb explosions are now believed to explain why many alkali metals explode when they come into contact with electronegative species like water. For example, here is a pretty cool video showing what happens when you put a drop of NaK (an alloy of sodium and potassium) in water. What is now believed to take place (as described in this paper) is that within a very short time the electrons are removed from the drop, leaving behind a highly charged liquid, which then essentially explodes due to the very strong repulsive forces in its interior."

Same reason your heart rate goes up during exercise: think of a chipmunk, bouncing around all the time -- it takes a lot of energy to do that, and thus a high heart rate.

Additionally, if you paired a Bb heterozygous black parent with a bb white parent...well, you've just produced a set of offspring where half are black.

If you took a population of 'white people' (which ... the concept of 'race' and the reality of genetics don't mix too well, frankly), put them into sub-Saharan Africa, and came back after a long period of time, I guarantee that either they would have died out, or they would have developed darker skin.

There are portions of all chromosomes which have different lineages from either your mother or father's side due to recombination. Some of the genes involved are dominant, some are recessive. Certain traits then, such as hair or eye color, are in large part controlled by dominant traits. However not all traits on the continuum of the stereotypical ""white"" person and ""black"" person behave in this manner. Just look around at people with mixed ethnic heritage, and look at their siblings if they have them. Often there's a lot of mixing of traits and the children don't necessarily look of either ethnicity.  On to your question of dominant genes vs recessive genes. As long as being homozygous for the recessive gene isn't bad, then no what you're describing wouldn't happen. It all depends on the fitness of individuals who are homozygous in either version versus heterozygous. If they're all of roughly the same fitness then what happens to the population is mostly due to random chance. A random fitness neutral mutation has equally likely a chance to sweep through the population regardless of if it is dominant or recessive."
askscience,3e2yxq,WildZontar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"The genes and their interactions that lead to skin color is very complex. The evolution of dark skin coincided with the loss of body hair from the human/chimpanzee common ancestor approximately 1.2 million years ago. A mutation in the MC1R gene (receptor that  signals the production of eumelanin, a skin pigment precursor) allowed the protein to be more active. This was favored in areas with higher UV exposure such as southern Africa. When human populations began to migrate out of Africa,  mutations on other genes decreased overall melanin production which allowed lighter skinned people. Areas such as Europe and Asia have less exposure to UV radiation, other mutations were allowed to propagate in the genes responsible for melanin production. Because the pathway for melanin production is so complex, beginning with tyrosine import and then modification, a mutation in any step could result in a less efficient pathway (aka slower rate of reaction)  and thus less melanin.

Any image you want to consider ""similar"" should produce the same hash.  The tricky part is that you want the hash to be just a few bytes (even though the whole image may be megabytes) and the hash should be identical even when there are:   subtle changes in hue/luminance/color-profile (re-encoding often changes color slightly) noise (JPEG adds DCT noise, and any encoding, even lossless, may add quantisation noise) subtle boundary changes (due to minor cropping)   A simple hash is to scale the image down to a tiny 4 by 4 square and then normalise the color values. You then have 48 bytes for your hash. Or an 8 by 8 and only use luminance for 64 bytes or only use bits for an 8 byte hash.  Other more complicated hashes involve using Speeded Up Robust Features (aka SURF, can find subimages and image fragments), Zernike moments (rotation invariant, highly noise tolerant, will find similar not just identical), singular value decomposition (good for finding exactly the same image with some jittering), feature point extraction (SURF is a sophisticated version but simpler versions are good for hashing faces and objects with specific shapes).

This is a problem because images are often resized, re-encoded and often in lossy formats like JPEG, where each re-encoding means a small loss of information. So, Google would probably have to employ a fuzzy matching algorithm. This probably works by downscaling an image and comparing it to the pool of images in Google's cache in a way that doesn't mind if some pixels are off.

I also personally suspect that comparatively little radioactive decay goes on in the moons, solely because the far higher average density of the first three planets seems like it would correspond with a much higher ratio of radioactive elements, all of which are heavy (by definition they have to be heavier than Iron)."

The main diference between us and our ancestors is that they only had the knowledge that acquired during their life time, they might pass it to others by showing but that was it. Knowledge could be lost very rapidly.  Now after writing was invented if you managed to write what you discovered you could preserve the knowledge, that made the transition from individual intelligence to civilization knowledge. Because we humans as a civilization kept the knowledge after the one individual that discovered it died, even more so with education you could reproduce the knowledge dozens of individuals fought their whole life to acquire compress it to a couple of years and distribute it the dozens, hundreds and eventually thousands of young men, that could later increment the knowledge a little more forward in several new fields.  With the advent of printing press that progress grew exponentially, with the advent of public mass education, it increased even more, and every single day thousands of people after years of studying our collective past knowledge for thousands of years in a specific area can push it a little forward, making humanity as a whole more knowledgeable than we could ever be individually.  We are stronger than the sum of all our parts because we have writing and education. We are intelligent but what gave us tools, the internet and the universe was our collective knowledge, one tiny human at time, pushing our knowledge a little more forward."

For example, someone had calculated the maximum age of the earth before radioactivity was known. He calculated how quickly the earth would cool down, and came up with a maximum age of the earth as around 20 million years. Of course, radioactive decay invalidated those calculations since it adds to the earth's heat.   The last estimate Thomson gave, in 1897, was: ""that it was more than 20 and less than 40 million year old, and probably much nearer 20 than 40"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth   There's similar things with the ratio of radioactive elements, as well. If you find too much of a particular radioactive element, it means that the earth would have to be young. For example, you can compare the amount of radioactive uranium in the earth's crust to the amount of its decay products. If there's a lot of radioactive uranium and virtually no decay products, it means the earth can't be very old. It turns out that if you look at all the radioactive elements on earth, they fall into two categories: radioactive elements that are generated by some process (like Carbon-14) or, if they aren't generated, they conform to the ratios that we would expect if the earth was at least 4.5 billion years old.  It's interesting how all these things that could be problems for evolution (if the numbers were different) end up working out consistently with what we would expect if evolution were true."

The rate at which the Sun emits energy is ~ 4E26 joules per second ... so we can determine that if the Sun was burning coal, it could burn at its current rate for ~ (6e37 J)/(4e26 J/s) ~ 1.5e11 seconds, or about 4700 years.

The Ancient Greek polymath Eratosthenes first calculated the circumference of the Earth (yes, they knew it was spherical) and possibly, using trigonometry and the best available data at the time, the distance from the sun to the Earth.  Kepler's laws of planetary motion established some rules about the motion of the planets and gave a few key relations between very important astronomical properties: year length, orbital distance, solar mass.  Now, this means that if we can calculate solar distance (from, say, blackbody radiation) we have the distance to the sun from the Earth. By knowing this it's a relatively simple trigonometric calculation to find the radius of the sun.  That's volume. Mass is actually a bit simpler.

You initially get heat when you compress something but it doesn't keep generating heat when you maintain the pressure.  I see this occasionally posted as the source of the heat inside the Earth. They say the core is hot because of all the pressure. But pressure is not an energy source, and gravity is not an energy source. You can't turn on an air compressor and have that tank stay hot forever. It get hot when it initially compresses the air and then cools off afterwards."

Now obviously as the previous commenter and our current knowledge shows, gravitational attraction alone isn't nearly enough on its own, but it wasn't that crazy of an idea thermodynamics-wise."
askscience,3dwkli,max2407,5,Mon Jul 20 13:25:21 2015 UTC,"You can continue to get energy from gravitational collapse if the object is still collapsing. The loss of energy from the sun due to radiation of light at its surface is actually very small compared to its internal thermal energy, so it would collapse very slowly if there was no such thing as fusion, such that its lifetime would be about 100 M years."
askscience,3dwkli,Lmcboy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:49 2015 UTC,"You're right. The idea was that the Sun is very gradually contracting under gravity, and continually radiating the heat generated by this compression.  Suppose you have a giant cloud of gas. It will contract under its own gravity. This compression will heat the gas up. As the gas gets hotter its internal pressure increases. Eventually this pressure balances the gravitational force, halting the contraction. However the hot gas is now emitting light, which carries away some of the heat energy. As this heat energy is lost the pressure in the gas falls. So gravity starts to win again, and the gas again contracts until the heat and pressure rise up again to balance gravity. And so on.  In this process gravitational potential energy is being continually converted into heat and then into light. The process ends if the gas cannot contract anymore. For stars, this fate is represented by white dwarfs, the end point of stellar evolution for most stars. White dwarfs are slowly cooling as they radiate all the heat produced by their initial contraction.  This view of the Sun is still kind of true, except that there is also an additional energy source, namely fusion in the core, which is much more important than gravitational potential energy."
askscience,3dwkli,The_Duck1,3,Mon Jul 20 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"When you turn off your compressor there isn't anything to maintain pressure so it looses energy.  The gravity of a body like the Earth's maintains continuous pressure towards its core.  As matter gets forced into occupying an ever more confined space it bumps into one another and excites, thus generating heat.    Should this jostling for space become energetic enough you reach the point of hydrogen fusion.  Prior to this matter just gets hot and fast, creating outward pressure.  Gravity might be the weakest of all fundamental forces in our universe but it's not to be trivialised.  It's effects move the continental plates and force stars to shine, powering all life on Earth.  You know what's awesome/scary.  We still don't fully understand why this is."

So if, for example, the star has a radius of 50,000 km, and it shrinks to 40,000km the energy at any point on its surface reduces from 50,000,000mg to 40,000,000mg. This energy has to go somewhere: the rotational speed spins up, but it also generates energy.  I don't know much about how the core maintains it's heat, but I'd imagine it's a mix of very good insulation and the huge amount of energy required to produce a movement under that pressure."

The complete annihilation of matter had not yet been observed, and he didn't think it likely, but he was on the right track.    In 1920 F.W. Aston was making precise mass measurements of various elements, and discovered that 4 Hydrogen atoms weighed more than 1 Helium Atom.  Eddington immediately knew how to correct his theory, this time theorizing that the sun converts Hydrogen to Helium.   Unfortunately, correction of his previous theory (that he knew was incomplete) did not get him as much attention as the guys who used the same method to reach the same conclusion in 1929.

Remember, small as they are, electrons have mass. In order to accelerate them (and thus create current) we need to exert a force on them. And that is where I will answer your question.  Your question is really about electric force, not current. It's the same force that you feel when static electricity raises the hair on your arm. This force is not mediated by electrons, but by photons.  Similarly, magnetic forces are also mediated by photons. Magnetic and electric forces are actually one and the same, two sides of the same coin called electromagnetism.   Light is just another expression of electromagnetism.

It is not clear how Pluto formed but is definitely the oddest of the bunch. It formed very far away from the sun and not the same way that planets traditionally form.  (I can't remember the name of the process but its where bits of tiny solid matter orbits the sun in a disc shape and eventually spins and coagulates together to form rocks and bolders and eventually planets) So because Mercury formed in the traditional sense, the way I just explained, it can be classed as a planet.

No, there seems to be a misconception around here that things close to the sun are always pulled into the sun. Planetoids, asteroids, etc. orbiting close to the sun are no more likely to fall into the sun than objects in the middle of the solar system or things in the Kuiper belt. There are stable orbits at all of these locations, and an object would have to suddenly decelerate to fall into the sun.   If Eris was close to the sun would it be classified as a planet too?   Probably. If it were at Mercury's orbit, the Stern-Levison parameter would be greater than 1 (although only around 5, so not orders of magnitude greater, like the actual planets, so it could still be debatable).   If Mercury was found in the Kuiper belt would it be classified as a dwarf-planet?   Yes.  But since the planets formed in their real orbits, it's not about where we found them, but rather, it's more like ""this massive object is the collection of most of the mass at this distance from the sun. It is gravitationally significant enough that everything around it either merged with it or was ejected from this orbit."" So by this view, Eris is insignificant, and if that amount of mass were much closer to the sun, it would have essentially done what Mercury did - gather all of the nearby mass."

Normally, our atmosphere is a very poor conductor, but if sufficient charge builds up in a cloud, the electric field might become strong enough in some places to start creating a conductive channel. Once this channel is complete and connects cloud to ground (or in some cases, different parts of a cloud with opposite charge), charges can flow freely.  The large current flowing through such a thin channel causes the air in the channel to heat quickly. And hot air takes up more volume than cold air, so the heated channel expands. Rapidly. This rapid expansion of the lightning channel creates a shockwave that we can hear as the boom in a thunder.

That other answer mentions the David Blaine stunt as an example of an isotonic solution being used in submersion. It also notes that that stunt wasn't exactly a shining star in Blaine's history because he failed pretty miserably and ended up with some somewhat severe ill effects. But that answer also states that an assumption is being made that pressure would be non-negligible. In the Blaine stunt, he was standing in a sphere of water and pressure would be non-negligible. But in OP's question here the person is laying in a bath and pressure would effectively be negligible.

askscience,3dy6ny,AnecdotallyExtant,12,Mon Jul 20 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"A couple of reasons. Pressure always increases with depth. In the bath a person could be fully submerged with only a centimeter of water over them. Pressure would be nearly non-existent. Whereas the sphere was 8 feet in diameter and his head was the only thing outside of the water. The problems he encountered were in his hands and feet which would have been subject to pressure at depth. Also, the nature of the sphere would further increase the pressure as there would be an inward pressure from the tapering sides.     Again, pressure in the bath could be all but eliminated.     (Edit: This comment was downvoted without explanation. I believe it's completely accurate. If that's untrue, please correct me.)"
askscience,3dy6ny,Lacklub,13,Mon Jul 20 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"inward pressure from the tapering sides   This isn't a factor. Pressure is only dependent on water depth. It's not like the water pressure in the ocean is higher beside a cliff than it is further from that cliff at the same depth. Tapering sides only changes pressure when you're dealing with flow.  That being said, you are correct in that the pressure at the depth of his hands and feet would be different than pressure laying down in a bath. I think the assumption by the original post was that the higher pressure wasn't the cause of the injuries."

Actually, now I'm thinking I am.     Okay, maybe this will help clear this up for me. If one were to increase the air pressure in the bubble at the top of the sphere then the pressure would increase throughout the water column.

askscience,3e1qcf,jazzagechoir,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:44 2015 UTC,"Hi Forensic scientist and ecologist here. So actually yes and there are a few examples. Although when it comes to male animals, the killing and aggression has been attributed to excess testosterone, and territorial dominance.  Examples:  -Jane Goodall first noticed serial killing animals in Chimpanzees. The worst was a Mother/Daughter pair who frequently would kidnap, beat and eat the babies of other females in the area. According to Jane Goodall they were very prolific.   -Elephants (sometimes attributed to musk and testosterone) have been seen killing other large animals basically for the fun of it. There are so many instances of Elephants killing rhinos and hippos in the wild that zoos don't even allow them to share pens anymore. Elephant males and females have been seen suddenly stampeding a couple football fields away to trample rhinos to death, rhinos with such poor eyesight probably couldn't see the elephant coming.  -Dolphins and Orca's (also attributed to hunting practice) have been known to attack other species of dolphin and porpoise for the sole purpose (haha see what I did there) of killing them. There are videos of Orca's finding smaller species of porpoise and tail slap passing them above the water like some demented Orca tennis game, and then not eating the battered remains. Dolphins have been known to literally rape other dolphins and animals to death (not joking).   -Shrikes and Butcherbirds- Shrikes (Americas) and Butcherbirds (Australasia) are falcon-like passerines (songbirds) that hunt anything smaller than themselves and sometimes bigger, and then ""larder"" them. Lardering means impaling on a thorny plant or barbed wire. In the Southern USA and Australia if driving by a barbed wire fence you may see insects, mice, lizards and other birds half impaled upon them, thats a Butcherbird territory (also colloquially called Butcherbirds in America) . While the birds eat like this, using the thorn to hold the food, many items never get eaten and it is thought that the uneaten remains are used to define territories and attract mates by saying ""I'm here and a good hunter! Don't fck with me/Please fck me""."

askscience,3e1oam,dutchovenpizza,5,Tue Jul 21 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"According to this list of specific heat capacity of different fluids, fresh water has a specific heat capacity of 4.19 kJ/kg K, while sea water (salinity not specified) has a specific heat capacity of 3.93 kJ/kg K (these numbers are temperature dependent though, but we should be able to ignore that). This means that seawater requires less energy to reach a specific temperature, thus heats up faster if the effect input is the same as for fresh water.   This is easy to realize if you think about the difference between 1 kg of fresh water, and 1 kg of salt water, and the difference between the specific heat capacity of water (4.19 kj/kg K) compared to that of salt (0.88 kJ/kg K). So to raise the temperature of 1 kg of fresh water by 1 K, we need to input 4.19 kJ of energy.   But what happens for a 20% solution of water and salt? Well, there is only .8 kg of water, and another .2 kg of salt. So we get 0.8*4.19+0.2*0.88 = 3.528 kj/kg K. I.e. we only have to input 3.528 kJ of energy into 1 kg of 20% water/salt solution in order to raise its temperature by 1 K. I.e. salty water heats up faster than fresh water.  But, if you take two pots, put the same amount of water in both, and then add salt to one of them, that one will heat up slower. Why? Well, you have the same amount of water in both pots, but you added salt to one of them. The water takes the same amount of energy to heat up, but the salt takes some additional energy to heat up.   But back to the example where the weight of both solutions are equal. I have showed that the salty water will heat up faster, but will it boil faster? Turns out that adding salt to water increases the boiling point (this can be calculated using the Ebullioscopic constant of water, I'm running out of time though, so I just assume that the info i found of about 2°C boiling point increase for 20% salt/water solution is correct).  We can quickly deduce that since the ratio between the specific heat capacity of water compared to 20% salt/water solution is much greater (4.19/3.53=1.18) than the ratio between the boiling points, (102/100=1.02) the 20% solution will definitely boil faster."

In terms of evaporating from the pot, the solution without salt will evaporate faster (see raoult's law) at the same temperature (boiling or not).

This is because of the following vertex in quantum electrodynamics:  vertex  which couples a fermion-antifermion pair to a photon. However, this alone is an unphysical process, as in: a fermion and antifermion cannot actually annihilate into a single photon. It is seen upon a brief computation that conservation of energy and momentum prohibits this process.  However it can happen if two photons are involved, as such:  diagram  so the particle-antiparticle pair can turn into a pair of photons. These photons will have in total the total energy of the two particles.  If the two particles are nonrelativistic, most of their energy will be rest energy [; 2 \cdot m c^2;]. This is generally a very large energy compared to the original kinetic energy. Positronium (a bound state of electron and positron) decays in vacuum by the above process into a pair of very energetic photons, on the order of the photon rest energy of [;511 \, \text{keV};].  However, more energetic fermion-antifermion collisions get also contributions from the weak and strong force. So all sorts of reactions can actually happen, not just annihilation into photons. This is precisely the point behind electron-positron colliders such as LEP.  Matter-antimatter, as in baryon-antibaryon annihilation is more difficult, because the pretty energetic photons produced by a single quark-antiquark annihilation can then interact with the other particles involved and produce different particles. It is better to see these kind of reactions in terms of hadronic physics. So you have a bouquet of different possibilities."

For the neutral pion, , [; \pi^0 \rightarrow \gamma \gamma ;] has partial width 98%.   For the eta meson, it's not as dominant, but still [;\eta \rightarrow \gamma \gamma;] at 39% wins over [;\eta \rightarrow 3\pi^0;] at 33%.  Moving to charmonium, [;J/\Psi;] would prefer to decay strong but the OZI rule suppresses the strong decay considerably. So the EM decay [;J/\Psi \rightarrow \gamma \rightarrow \text{hadrons};] at 14% is not insignificant compared to the 64% [;J/\Psi \rightarrow 3g ;].  Moving on, yes, typically EM decay falls short.

That's why when two protons are smashed together in a Hadron Collider you get so many unuasual particles out, because lots of the kinetic energy of the proton is converted into mass and we experience new particles. The higher the energy the more particles. So when you see a matter anti-matter annihilation a lot of the time the energy released will be in the form of particles or neutrinos or photons of light.  The simplest annihilation would be the electron- positron which in turn releases two gamma photons. I know it's long winded but I hope it helps."

askscience,3dwq56,detinith,290,Mon Jul 20 04:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, in SR, no two objects can travel, relative to each other, faster than light. Often, students then ask questions like: ""If B is traveling at 0.8c with respect to A, and C is traveling in the opposite direction at 0.8c with respect to A, does that mean B is traveling at 1.6c with respect to C?""  The answer is no. Velocities do not add linearly in SR. Instead of the normal formula V = u+v, we have the formula V = (u+v)/(1+uv/c2). So in my example, the speed of C relative to B is V = (0.8c+0.8c)/(1+0.82) = (1.6/1.64)c = 0.9765c. So they travel relative to each other slower than light speed, as expected. However, according to A, the coordinate of B is x = 0.8ct, and the coordinate of C is x = -0.8ct. So the difference in coordinates is X = 1.6ct, and this coordinate difference has a speed of 1.6c. This coordinate difference velocity is also called the mutual velocity of B and C, according to A. Do not confuse it with the relative velocity of B with respect to C.  Now, I should mention that even this picture is not entirely right, although the difference is subtle and rather advanced. In GR, there are no global inertial frames, only local ones. What this means is that the relative velocity of distant objects is not actually well defined! It is entirely possible for such distant objects to have a relative speed greater than c, for example, because of the expansion of the universe. But if the objects are very close so that the effects of spacetime curvature can be ignored, then the two objects must have a relative speed less than light speed.  edit: Some clarifications.   All inertial frames in SR move at constant velocity with respect to each other and that velocity must be <c. A consequence of this fact is that photons have no rest frame. This is further emphasized by the fact that world lines of photons are null (i.e., ds2 = 0) at all points, and there is no way to define a proper time for such paths. Therefore, it is meaningless to ask questions such as ""what does the universe look like to a photon?"", ""if B and C are photons in the above example, at what speed do they move relative to each other?"", etc. Just to reiterate, it is nonsense to say things like ""a photon experiences zero time"" (nonsense because its rest frame is undefined), ""a photon experiences infinite length contraction"" (nonsense for the same reason), ""a photon completes a journey of X length in 0 time, it is everywhere at the same time"" (nonsense for the same reason). Do not confuse a photon's world line being a null geodesic (ds2 = 0 everywhere) with the statement that its proper time is 0. In fact, its proper time is undefined simply because it is a null geodesic. Suppose we have two inertial frames, S and S', in standard configuration. So their x-axes are parallel and their temporal origins coincide. Frame S' moves along the positive x-axis of S with velocity v. Now suppose there is an object which moves along the x-axis of S' at velocity u with respect to S'. (I say object and not ""inertial frame"" because I want to allow for the object to be a photon, which does not have an inertial frame.) In classical mechanics (i.e., Galilean relativity), the velocity of the object as seen from frame S would be V = (v+u). But this obviously can't be right in SR because this can easily be >c. Velocities do not add linearly. The correct formula is V = (v+u)/(1+uv/c2). (Be aware that the formula is a bit more complicated if the velocities are not colinear.) It turns out then that V is always <c as long as both u and v are. If either of u or v is =c, then V = c, which emphasizes the invariance of the speed of light. In my example with A,B,C, there is a distinction between the mutual velocity of B and C as observed from A and the relative velocity of B and C. The mutual velocity of B and C as observed from A is simply, from A's frame, the rate at which the distance between B and C changes. It is not the velocity of an actual object, and is sometimes called a coordinate velocity to emphasize that fact. Since objects can travel with a velocity at most c, the mutual velocity of two objects is bounded by 2c (e.g., two photons moving in opposite direction as seen from A). The mutual velocity is the rate of change of the separation of B and C, as seen from A. The relative velocity of B and C is the rate of change of the separation of B and C, as seen from B (or C, just with a minus sign). To determine the relative velocity of B and C, we must use the relativistic velocity addition formula. For that, we note that A moves to the left at 0.8c as seen from B, and C moves at 0.8c to the left as seen from A. So B sees C move to the left with velocity V = (0.8c+0.8c)/(1+0.64) = 0.9765c, about 98% of light speed. Very fast, but still less than light speed. Note that the velocity addition formula holds for all speeds, no matter how small or large. It's just that if the speeds are very small compared to c, the error between the relativistic formula and the Galilean formula is extremely small. So suppose you are on a highway, standing still with respect to the ground. A car whizzes past you at 50 mph, and that car sees another car whiz past him at 10mph. What is the speed of the second car with respect to you? The answer is not 60mph. You have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but the value you get is different from 60mph only by about 1 part in 10-15. The difference is extremely small. For the more math-inclined, there is a velocity parameter that does add linearly, for all possible speeds. The parameter is called the rapidity and is defined by Φ = tanh-1(v/c). It then turns out that the velocity addition formula can be written as ΦV =  Φu+Φv. I originally wrote    In GR, there are no global inertial frames, only local ones. What this means is that the relative velocity of distant objects is not actually well defined! It is entirely possible for such distant objects to have a relative speed greater than c, for example, because of the expansion of the universe.    These last two sentences seem to contradict each other, because I used sloppy language. It is true that in GR, the relative velocity of distant objects is ill defined. However, we do observe a Doppler shift of photons between Earth and distant galaxies (the so-called redshift), which may be interpreted as a relative velocity. Strictly speaking, it is not. But the relative velocity from that calculation is allowed to be greater than c."

If we were talking about purely newtonian speeds then yes that means you must be moving infinitely fast as we perceive it to experience all positions simultaneously.  The thing about relativity though is in unadulterated spacetime c is maximal in the same way as infinity because it influences the way space and time together are perceived.  The linkages of space and time by relativity are literally outlining what it means for two events to be simultaneous.  The key being that relativistic time, more specifically the way time is perceived by observers in relativistic situations, is not linear and by extension not intuitive.  It might actually be easier to think of c as being infinitely fast, honestly.  Assuming no funny business changing the shape of spacetime of course."

However if a photon has no concept of time, I'm confused how it could perceive velocity at all.   You have stumbled onto the reason why /u/andromeda5E 's description is wrong. The description is what you inevitably conclude by naively looking at the equations of special relativity and taking the limit as velocity approaches the speed of light; however, if you actually plug in v = c, you get an undefined quantity, and there is no physical reason why we should expect that limit to be meaningful.   It is in fact to the contrary! Considering a reference frame moving at the speed of light necessarily results in inconsistencies such as the one you pointed out: there can be no notion of speed from the hypothetical perspective of anything moving at the speed of light, which means considering such a reference frame violates the second postulate of special relativity (that the speed of light is c in every reference frame). Not only should every other photon be traveling at c with respect to the photon whose 'perspective' we're trying to imagine, but that photon's speed should also be c... in its own reference frame! This is obviously nonsensical. In other words, using special relativity to analyze the reference frame of something traveling at the speed of light is fundamentally wrong, and cannot be done. You cannot use relativity to analyze something that inherently violates one of its fundamental assumptions.  The reference frame of light is not described by relativity, and so trying to describe it within the context of relativity simply cannot be done. To the best of our understanding, the correct conclusion is that there simply is no such thing as a physical reference frame traveling at c. It is possible that a future correction or addition to our knowledge may change that; but based on special relativity, that is all there is to it."

Photons don't have a reference frame, so it's literally impossible to correctly imagine what the world looks like to a photon ( others have given convincing approximations and analogies, these will lead to unphysical results when you think them through). It's as much an unphysical question as ""how fast does an electron spin?"" or ""How fast would one need to move to escape a black hole?"". These questions only make sense in simplified models of the universe that do not propperly apply to the real world.  As for why a photon has no reference frame, a photon is a self-sustaining oscilating electromagnetic field. Now try to imagine a stationary photon, i.e. a stationary, self-sustaining oscilating electromagnetic field. Obviously, an electromagnetic field cannot be both oscilating and stationary at the same time (any solution of the Maxwell equations that both oscilates and does not move will not be self-sustaining). So we have a contradiction when we try to imagine a photon; either a photon is not a self-sustaining oscilating electromagnetic field, or a photon cannot be stationary. The former cases would require us to toss out everything we know about photons, but the later just means that photons are not the same as massive particles (something we already knew)."

So it experiences its emission, the travel through space, and its final absorption at the same time.   So, to imagine the two torch question, you have fired two photons in opposite directions at the same time, they passed through space, and then were absorbed by two different objects. If one was somehow able to look back at the other, it would see it in every point it passes through, like a line, whilst it experienced every point it was passing through at the same time. This means the photons relative speeds are meaningless.  It's a bit of a mind-fluff, as imaging events happening without time isn't really what our brains are designed to do.

For example, if we were to take a reference frame in which the momentum of a particle is 0 and the particle is at the origin, then quantum mechanics states that the uncertanty on the particle's location is infinite. In other words, while the expectation value r = r|p> = 0, the particle is not actually localized at the origin and in fact since the uncertanty is infinite the probability of finding the particle at the origin is infinitismally small. Clearly this is a significant departure from what we would normally recognize as a reference frame."

It is something that we talk about to make it possible to understand physics. In reality, photons do what photons do and protons do what protons do. The rules of special relativity seem to be pretty certain. Maybe there is a mathematical formalism that you would like better that has yet to be discovered, but that is very different from not believing that relativity is true.  Cent #2 Why shouldn't different objects obey different rules? That may not ""feel"" right to you, but there is no law of nature that says everything should be treated by the exact same rules."

He's saying that instead of adding 1c + 1c = 2c, you use the (u+v)/(1+uv/c2 ) formula. In the example he used, the objects were moving at 0.8c.  If I understand it right, u and v are the velocities of the two photons. So if we plug in two photons each moving at the speed of light, we'd see the other moving at (1c+1c)/(1+(1*1)) = (2/2)c = 1c. Each photon would see the other as moving at the speed of light, even though conventional physics tells us different things for, say, highway speeds.

This transformation doesn't exist for light, since all reference frames see the same speed for c. The existence of a reference frame for an object moving at c is a contradiction, since it would have to see itself as having a speed of both 0 and c.  More specifically, given an object with timelike motion you can pick a Lorentz transformation to swing its four-velocity parallel to the time axis.

But that's not a proper use of the formula. Think about what you are doing exactly. You are saying you have a frame S' moving at c with respect to S, and another frame S'' moving at c with respect to S'. So then V gives the velocity of S'' with respect to S. This is not right because photons (objects moving at c) do not have inertial frames.  However, it does make sense to say the following. Consider a frame S' moving at speed u with respect to S. Then S' emits a photon (at speed c). What is the speed of this photon as seen from S? Now we can use the velocity addition formula, with v = c.   V = (u+c)/(1+uc/c2) = (u+c)/(1+u/c) = c(u+c)/(u+c) = c   So S also sees the photon moving at c. Also note that the value of u does not matter since it entirely cancels out.

If I run away from you at 8 mph, and you run in the opposite direction at 8 mph, you still can't just add ""8 + 8"". You have to do (8+8)/(1 + 8*8/c2) to get the correct answer. Well, you'd need to do the unit conversions from mph first, but we'll ignore that.

askscience,3dwq56,welding-_-guru,3,Mon Jul 20 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this logic is incorrect. You are not taking into account length contraction.  An object in motion experiences both time dilation (time slows as speed increases) and length contraction (distances shrink as speed increases): this is how general relativity solves the dilemma you present. Say B travels 5 light years away from A, as measured in the reference frame of A; and B traverses this distance at close to the speed of light. In A's time, the journey takes more than 5 years, but in B's, it takes much less time. This is because, as soon as B starts moving at close to the speed of light, it measures the distance to the destination as less than 5 light years. At the end of the journey, if B stops (and assuming it returns to a time frame that progresses at the same speed as A's), B will also measure the distance traveled as 5 light years. If B takes this distance and divides it by the time it seems to have traveled, it will think that it traveled ""faster than the speed of light."" But this math is invalid, because two different reference frames are being used. In reality, at no point during the journey did B travel faster than the speed of light, due to length contraction.  That is, the speed of light limitation on velocity refers to an instantaneous speed in a given reference frame. If you want to do invalid math and compare two different reference frames, it is theoretically possible to traverse a distance that you initially measure, while stationary, as 100 light years, in what seems to you (the traveler) like only 2 years. However, once you get there, everyone you knew back at the origin is dead, because more than 100 years have passed in that original frame. In your moving frame, you do not travel even 2 light years, because the space in front of you contracts while you move through it at such a high speed."

While most people here are discussing General Relativity and Special Relativity I am thinking more about cosmic expansion.  If you have two objects separated by sufficient space the cumulative effect of expanding space will add up to the two objects moving away from each other FTL.

So how could that work?   I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.  The expansion of the space immediately around the object would already be accounted for in the previous calculation.  If you mean that since both objects will be at rest in their own internal reference frames then how are they accelerating or moving away from eachother at all.  The problem with this is it does not take into account the whole system (in this case both objects).  While an object can claim to be at rest when referencing its own FoR , when comparing the two objects in this scenario all observers would agree that both objects do not share a single FoR and therefore must be experiencing some form of acceleration compared to one another.    It's like a warp drive space is contracting and expanding. But the velocity of the object is 0. Just the space around is the object is moving.   This is close, but it is not fully correct.  In a warp drive the ship/capsule/whatever is not perfectly stationary.  The trick is to compress spacetime in front then travel forward and let spacetime snap back behind you.  In this way you travel faster than light from an observer's reference frame but in your own you do not, but you still have some speed and acceleration.  Otherwise when you let spacetime snap back (when you turn off your warp drive) you would not have moved at all."
askscience,3dwq56,MrTartle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"Space, as viewed from the reference frame of an object, will view every other reference frame as contracted along the direction of travel.  Thus, any object moving at any speed will see space contracted just enough to preserve the relative speed of light.  Basically, if you are going 0.5 c, then a stationary kilometer long rod will be 0.5km long from your perspective.    Thus an object traveling towards you at 1 km/s, will appear to be moving at 0.5 m/s.   If that object is coming towards you at 0.5c then it will appear to be going 0.25c  Another way to think about this;  the other vehicles time is also contracting, as seen from your reference frame.  So an object, from its reference frame will say its moving 1km/s, but for you, it's clocks are saying its moving 1km per 2 seconds. It's apparent time will be slower from your perspective.  These are gross simplifications of the lorentz transformation, but its useful to project linearly for thinking about it, instead of the logarithmic contractions with relative velocity.   The actual equation is V = (u+v)/(1+uv/c2), So the relative velocity of 2 things moving at 0.5c towards each other is 1 / 1.25 = 0.8c, Or stated differently, their clocks will be going 20% slower, thus they are covering 20% less apparent distance over the same amount of time.

So, for example, if an object at the edge of the observable universe is pushed out of the observable universe from expansion, then if we could measure that object (which we can't) then we would measure a speed greater than c."

When it comes to IR, there's nothing blocking the light.  Your photoreceptors just aren't sensitive to the longer wavelengths.  The closest it comes is that people are naturally variable, and some people have receptors that pick up longer wavelengths than others.  The textbook border between red and infrared is a wavelength of 700 nanometers, but some people can push this boundary to 730nm, 750nm, etc.  Even with more sensitive eyes, the intensity of the perception drops off dramatically, requiring a brighter and brighter light source for a person to perceive it.

askscience,3dxuag,PhysicistJack,52,Mon Jul 20 12:41:05 2015 UTC,"Where humans feel cooling (or heating) based on the rate of heat transfer from/to their body, thermometers typically measure the actual temperature, rather than the rate of heat flow.  Take for example the mercury thermometer. This device functions using the fact that mercury expands when it heats up. This property applies to pretty much every material, but mercury has properties that make it especially suitable for use in a thermometer (amount of expansion as function of temperature, liquid state at the entire range of everyday temperatures, etc...)  At high temperature, the same amount of mercury will be less dense and occupy more of the volume inside the temperature. When it's cold, the mercury will occupy a smaller volume. Through calibration, one can put readout markings along the tube of the thermometer.  In any case, it is the absolute temperature of the mercury that determines the amount of volume it fills. The only thing that wind might change is the speed with which the mercury comes in thermal equillibrium with the surrounding air, and therefore the speed at which the temperature reading is adjusted after the air temperature changes.  In everyday applications, you probably won't notice this effect. You might see a small difference between a calm and a windy day if you take the thermometer out of a well heated house into the freezing cold outside. If it's windy, the temperature reading should drop more quickly as the wind helps the mercury to shed its heat more rapidly than if the wind wouldn't have been there."

If this were possible, then we would have a free source of cooling, since all you would have to do is spray water on something, let it evaporate, which then would [in this thought experiment] lower the temperature, promoting more condensation, etc, in a runaway chain of cooling, with no net heat being moved into the environment."

Additionally, the seeking of knowledge creates tools that can be applied. Some of the most powerful mathematical tools are required to investigate primes and this has spurred much mathematical innovation which, in turn, has applications.  But these are not the reasons why prime numbers are so prevalent in math. Cryptography, in a way that can really take advantage of primes, hasn't been practical until computers became prevalent but primes have been the center of math since the ancient times.   In the times of the Greeks, Babylonians, Egyptians, Mayans, culture had grown to the point where people did not need to be constantly concerned with menial tasks and practicality, leaving time for people to think and create. From this we see great advancements in both Science and Art. The ability and drive to ask a question, for it's own sake, and to seek an answer is a sign of high culture. Astronomy was one of these big questions asked by the ancients, and while it has had application here and there, astronomers are mostly people who ask questions about the nature of the cosmological universe. Is there going to be any practical application to the New Horizons mission? Most likely no, but it is one of mankind's greatest achievements and astronomy continues to be one of our greatest endeavors.  Similarly, we seek to understand the nature of arithmetic. Particularly multiplication and addition of integers. This has also been one of mankind's greatest endeavors. Not because of what the answers allow us to do, but for how compelling the questions are. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that prime numbers are the cornerstones of understanding integer arithmetic. The Infinitude of Primes tells us that there are infinitely many of these building blocks, so integer arithmetic never gets trivial, no matter how large we get. The allow us to reduce other questions to simple cases involving primes. For instance, if you want to know what integers can be a hypotenuse for a right triangle with integer length sides, then you only need to figure out which primes can be hypotenuses. It turns out that a prime can be on a hypotenuse exactly when it has remainder 1 after dividing by 4. So 3, 7, 11, 19 are not hypotenuses, but 5, 13, 17 are.  There are just so many questions involving primes, and the use of primes is usually the ""best possible"" or ""most fundamental"" cases when working with integers. Are there infinitely many primes that are hypotenuses? That are not hypotenuses? Are there infinitely many primes whose last digit is 1? 3? 7? 9? How close are primes allowed to be with infinite frequency? How much to primes spread apart as you move up the number line? How fundamental are primes to addition? Do equations such as x7+y7=z7 or y2=x3+Ax+B, have integer solutions? How many? How does arithmetic change when we include roots to polynomials, such as sqrt(-1), 51/13 etc? What is the affect on primes? Are there hidden biases and patterns in the location of primes, or is it random? Is there a connection between primes and geometry? Can we take advantage of it?  These are questions that have troubled and fascinated the most brilliant people in human history. Many are still unanswered. The investigation of primes is an endeavor that has lasted since the beginning of civilization, and is one of the greatest quests of mankind. Just as the ancients looked up at the stars and wondered why they moved, so we still look at the primes and wonder about them.   But just like alcohol, primes are an acquired taste. What may be revolting when first learning of them may be the sweetest nectar after gaining familiarity. Take a look at the book Prime Obsession to begin to understand these kinds of questions.  Do primes have applications? Does it matter?"

The speed with which this can be done is related to your ability to factor N.  Ideally we want to make N a power of 2 (so for example N = 32 = 25 would work very well) -- then the algorithm will proceed very fast.  If N is prime, then it happens more slowly.  If there were a quick way to figure out the prime factors of N, it would allow us to perform this operation more quickly."

askscience,3e0piu,RothBraun,4,Tue Jul 21 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldnt say all of them are destined to collide.. there are a lot of star systems out there and up to 2/3 of these are thought to be binary systems. There are a whole bunch of different things that can happen to these, including collision however i think the more likely result would be the less massive of the two stars in the system seeding its mass to the larger of the two stars.   This is how helium white dwarf stars are thought to be formed. One star loses much of its outer layer to a larger companion star until the point all that remains is the resulting helium from the hydrogen fusion at the stars core. Without the necessary mass to create the energy required to continue producing energy through helium fusion the star is effectively dead. I could be wrong but i think this is the most common type of binary system (big star, white dwarf)."
askscience,3e0piu,Kelsicle,3,Tue Jul 21 10:18:55 2015 UTC,"Actually. A way for them to collide is from loss of energy through gravitonal waves. Two orbiting bodies produce gravitonal waves, which becomes orbital energy loss. So effectively as time moves on the binary stars will indeed orbit each other closer and closer.   The time scale of this can be fairly short, like two binary neutron stars, or insanely long, like the Earth around the sun.   The time scale is based off of mass of the objects and distance. A two massive neutron stars could collapse into each other in half a million years. How ever the earth and sun would take up to 1023 years to collide.  Basically this sums up to the fact that any orbiting body will eventually collide with its counterpart. It may take an enormous amount of time, and other events will probably occur disrupting to  the binary star system before this happens."

askscience,3e1acl,Respectful_Lurker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:42:53 2015 UTC,"The current theory is that sex evolved as a way to help combat parasites. There are several species of worms which exhibit both asexual and sexual reproduction, alternating between the two modes as they please.  This paper shows that asexually reproducing only worms are rapidly driven to extinction by parasites, while sexually reproducing ones can survive.  Asexual reproduction doesn't allow the genetic shuffling which sexual reproduction does, meaning that if a parasite infects you, it will also infect all your children. Sexual reproduction is a way to escape from parasites.  In these examples the sexual reproduction is done by hermaphrodites. Evolution of male and female specialisations probably followed."
askscience,3e1acl,Kandiru,2,Tue Jul 21 09:21:50 2015 UTC,just to extend your answer: having fixed genders is a genetic advantage over hermaphrodites because those are likely to fight (and waste energy) to decide who has to play the female part (because the male can spread more genes and therefore prefering the male role is a genetic advantage)  for fixed genders there is no act of deciding and the energy can be spend elsewhere
askscience,3e1acl,MfgLuckbot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:06:56 2015 UTC,"It depends for hermaphrodites vs fixed sex. In the deep ocean many fish are hermaphrodites as the population density is very low, so the chance of encountering a fellow fish of the same species is low. When it does happen, you want to be able to mate rather than have two fish of the same gender!   A gene which turns a hermaphrodite into a male can rapidly spread through a population, as a male is able to mate with many hermaphrodites. When a population is composed of mostly males and hermaphrodites, there is little point in a hermaphrodite wasting energy making sperm, and so there will be a selective advantage for changes which make them only female. Then you have a population of males and females."

askscience,3e1acl,egodebt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:12 2015 UTC,"The first thing to bear in mind is that the evolution of sexual reproduction and the evolution of the male and female sexes are not the same thing. Sexes are defined by differences in the gametes (for us, sperm vs. eggs) but you can have sexual reproduction with the same gametes in different 'mating types' that have molecular mechanisms that determine compatibility (and even some species of fungi where everyone can reproduce with everyone).  The evolution of sexes is essentially the evolution of anisogamy - gametes with different physical characteristics. In our case, we have oogamy with big, immobile eggs in females and small, mobile sperm in males. Our best hypothesis for the origin of the different gametes, and thus our sexes, is as a result of disruptive selection on size. In our isogamous (similar gametes) ancestor, reproductive success was largely dependent on how hard it was for your gametes to find other gametes, how much competition your gametes had from other gametes, and how likely that, once fertilised, your new offspring was likely to develop successfully. To be better at competition and finding other gametes it's better to make lots of gametes (which will necessarily be smaller because you've still got the same amount of resources to make them with), and to improve the survival of your successfully fertilised offspring it's better to make your gametes bigger to give them more resources to develop with. So you have selection for big gametes and small gametes - anything in the middle will be worse at surviving than the big ones, and worse at fertilising than the small ones. Big gametes will rarely meet to fertilise, and combining small gametes will produce terrible zygotes. Once this has been established you have two mating types - sexes - with morphological differences that will be under sex-specific selection to pursue their own sex-specific reproductive strategies (though the precise order of mating types and sexes isn't set in stone).  The evolution of mating types themselves is slightly more contentious. It may have been to mediate conflict over the inheritance of organelles (like mitochondria) where if they are inherited from both parents they can compete and harm the offspring, to avoid inbreeding, to allow signalling that governs the correct timing of reproductive processes, as well as a few other things. This is all properly reviewed here."

You'd be better off eating a peice of cheese, the sharper the better, because it will act as a neutralizing agent by pulling the saliva PH away from the acidity sugar causes.   There are also efforts to target mutans with specific mouthwash. Right now something like Listerine acts as a 'bleach' on the mouth, wiping out all the fauna equally, which then grow back in  proportions to their prior state. Targeted mouthwash that hit only mutans would give the other fauna in the mouth opportunity to replace it ecologically. People who 'never have cavities' probably have a similar state through chance and genetic inheritance, but the prospects are out there.  edit: specific to licking, the gaps between your teeth and in the crevices along the roof of each tooth are where the real damage is done.

It stays liquid above 100°C, but if you disturb it too much it starts boiling violently from the disturbance outwards, moving into the lower energy state of being vapour.  Now, here we're talking about quantum fields, and quantum fields do not need external disturbances. They have their own quantum fluctuations, so the transition can happen spontaneously, and travel outwards as a true vacuum bubble.   What would it look like?   Like nothing. It would move at the speed of light, so you'd never know until you're dead.   And is it really possible for our universe to just suddenly, at any random moment, collapse?   In theory yes, but with the current parameters, it is too unlikely (or maybe impossible). Even if it was somewhat likely, it didn't happen in 14 billion years, so I'd say we're safe at least for a bit.  I wouldn't read this metastability in a catastrophist light but as a very interesting observation. The plot in question is this:  plot  (only consider the larger ellipse. The inner ellipses are hypothetical)  the mass of the Higgs and the top quark really seem to like being that close to the unstability line (also notice how stability is not excluded - unstability obviously is because, well, I feel fine)  The idea that they are very close to the unstability line could suggest that the [;\lambda;] parameter, modulating the self-interaction of the Higgs, is 0 along with its derivative at the Planck scale.

For example the first Higgs phase transition (if it was first order..), wôuld most certainly be much slower than the speed of light and probably even slower than the speed of sound (1/Sqrt(3) c).  This is due to the friction of the background plasma, which counteracts the expansion of the bubbles of true vacuum.   This has an interesting application in the form of  electroweak baryogenesis, which could explain the matter asymmetry of the universe !

There should be an awareness that there are also uncountably infinite sets (like R, or [as another example] the set of all subsets of N).  Actually, and this will probably really help OP though perhaps too buried to be noticed: the 'real' source of the paradox is what's going on when we talk about 'size' of a set. If I have the set {1, 2, 3} and {2, 4, 6} they're 'clearly' the same size because  1 <--> 2, 2 <--> 4, and 3 <--> 6, with no 'leftover' elements. OTOH, {1, 2} and {2, 4, 6} don't have the same size because there's no bijection -- no function maps each element of the first set onto exactly one element of the second and vice versa.   So our conception of size follows our intuitive understanding for finite sets. Ex: the set of all even numbers from 1-10 inclusive and the set of all odd numbers from 1-10 inclusive is the same size because 1 <--> 2; 3 <-->4, ... 9 <--> 10. The set of all numbers from 1-10 is larger than the set of all even numbers from 1-10. In the first case, we have the function is 2n-1 <--> 2n, 0<n<6. In the second, we have no such function.  When we talk about size with infinite sets, though, we can use this same conception of size to show that the set of all positive integers is the same size as the set of all perfect squares. Here, we have the bijection n <--> n2. 1 <--> 1; 2 <--> 4;, 3 <--> 9, ...  Here we see we have a perfect 1:1 mapping of each element of the first set onto each elements of the second, and vice versa. Hence, they're they same size."

Easy: just tell guest #383727 that they can use the 383727'th room once it's built, and so forth.  When the other infinite line of guests arrives, you tell the guests that already have a room that they need to double their room number and go to the room with that number (once it's built). You then start handing out the odd rooms to guests in the new line and start handing out the remaining even numbers to guests in the existing line.

Infinity is not a set nor a number, it is a concept. In mathematics (and especially in physics) we will often use infinity like it's a number but that's not strictly correct. Really what we are doing is taking the limit as a ""regular"" number grows to approach infinity, but keep in mind that it doesn't make sense for it to ""reach"" infinity.

When we talk about a limit as a number grows arbitrarily large, that's calculus or real analysis and contrary to what he said, it does not obey cancellation: inf/inf and inf-inf remain undefined.  There are geometric notions of infinity as well (see the ""point at infinity"" on the Riemann sphere or the ""circle at infinity"" of the projective plane).  The notion of ""infinity"" that's used in the Hilbert Hotel discussion is simply the set of natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ... forever. We say that for every natural number, there is a room with that number. This kind of infinity (called ""countable infinity"") has the seemingly weird property that although only ""half"" of natural numbers are even, there are nevertheless as many even natural numbers as there are natural numbers. This is the property that's illustrated by the first part of the Hilbert Hotel ""paradox"".   I should look at it as a set of numbers that contains all things   This is very close: instead of ""all things"", say ""all natural numbers"", and you've essentially got it.

The set containing all of the natural numbers isn't changing in size. The cardinal number (the number that counts members of a set) of the set containing all of the natural numbers is usually called aleph-0.   Your next question is a good one because it shows that you have made it to the next level of conceptual understanding. An infinite set is such that it is the same size as one of its proper subsets. This is not true of finite sets. This theorem was proven by Cantor by showing that we can put members of an infinite set into a one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of that same set. This makes it a little hard to understand because the definition of a ""proper subset"" is that it is a subset of a set, that is not also the same set.  Infinity is not like other numbers.

I think you are attaching some metaphysical presumptions to the concept of infinity that aren't really valid. It is important to understand that infinity is a concept. It exists as a mental representation (i.e. an idea) in the mind. This is a very powerful thing, and not limited by physical, biological, or social rules. It is entirely possible to have an Infinite Hotel where an infinity of guests show up, all of whom are different from each other, and all of whom are not the same as any existing historical or fictional person from our history as it has unfolded.  Insofar as the original formulation of the Infinite Hotel is concerned, all of the guests are free to move about and associate with anyone they want, and we can imagine that the messages left at the front desk would be adequate to contact every guest so as to give the notice that they need to change rooms. Those sorts of issues have no impact on the validity of the original thought experiment.

askscience,3dwvqv,viciarg,19,Mon Jul 20 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"I'll explain what this has done another way. Two strings that are infinitely long, one red, one blue. Both wish to occupy the same space. Red string is already in that space, to create room for blue string you create a wave, and feed blue into the now empty space. The red wave will go on infinitely and you will infinitely fill in blue for red. You never finish putting blue string in because it's infinite, and red string is never again ""at rest,"" because it is constantly moving for blue.   I don't see the equivalence.    I felt I grasped infinity pretty well, but does my explanation make sense, or am I missing a fundamental part of this thought experiment?  Because it's infinite you'll never free up enough space (the hotel is occupied at every number you get to) for another infinite amount of people.   Most likely, since the argument in the video seemed correct to me but you are disagreeing with the conclusion. It seems you're assuming that the process of people in the hotel moving to even numbered rooms never terminates, correct? Why do you not have the same objection when we added just a single person to the hotel? The two scenarios really aren't all that different, instead of picturing that all of the people in the hotel scrambled from room n to room 2n picture instead that the concierge took the 1st person in the bus to the 1st room. We've reduced this to the case of adding one person, except instead of being instructed to move one room over the hotel guests are instructed to double their room number. Great, we've reduced it to a solved problem and we're done with the 1st person in the bus. Next we take the 2nd person in the bus, take them to room 3, and instruct the hotel guests as above. Again, solved problem, we are done. We can continue this way and for every person in the bus we can find them a room in a way that everyone that was already in the hotel has a room, as we intended to do.  The point isn't to free up enough rooms, because you need to free up infinitely many rooms and infinity is finicky to deal with if you picture it as a number. So the way the problem is handled is you need to find a way that each person is assigned at most 1 room in the hotel, if you can assign them at least 1 room in the hotel you don't need to keep track of whether you've freed up enough room as every guest has a room and your job is done. As you can see the staff in the hotel are work to rule, fucking unions.  One issue you may be having is you're attributing too much to the physical plausibility of the scenario. This is a cute illustration, but at the end of the day what you're actually dealing with is sizes of sets, in particular you're answering the question ""how do we quantify the size of a set with infinitely many elements"". You can say they're infinitely large but how do we compare them when we have the natural numbers (1,2,3,...) and the integers (...,-1,0,1,2,...), is one bigger than the other? What do we even mean by size?  The answer interestingly is that there are as many natural numbers as integers, which we get when exploring for a bit what we mean by size of a set, something also known as cardinality.  Suppose we have a set containing 3 letters, {a,b,c}, and a set containing 3 numbers, {1,2,3}, how do we say which is bigger? Well we can count them both up and end up with 3 elements in each, which is great but that isn't going to be of much use in the infinite case. Another way to go about it is we can find a way to assign a unique letter to each number and a unique number to each letter: a corresponds to 1 and vice versa, b<->2,c<->3. We call that assignment a 'bijection'. We can also figure out when one is bigger than the other by similar means, suppose we compare {a,b,c}, and {1,2,3,4}, we can see the second set is bigger, but why? Well for every letter we can assign a unique number a->1, b->2, c->3, but we have a number (4) that can't be assigned a unique letter. It is useful with infinite sets to do the assignment one way, without checking if the reverse can even work, and say that the second set is at least as big as the first.  Now let's go and compare the integers with the natural numbers. Now since the integers contain the natural numbers we see the integers are at least as big as the natural numbers. What we need to show is that the natural numbers are at least as big as the integers, we do this by the assignment process above. That is to say given an integer we need to assign it a natural number and no natural number can be assigned twice. How do we do that?  Let's start with the largest integer that isn't a natural number, 0 (in my definition), and assign it to 1. Now let's put the natural numbers in themselves by taking a natural number and multiplying it by 2, which is the assignment 1->2, 2->4, 3->6,...   Which natural number would be taken by this process? well 1 is taken and so is the even natural numbers. What's left is 3 and every odd number bigger than it. So we can assign -1 -> 3, -2 -> 5... (the algebraic rule here is whenever k<0 , assign(k)= 2* |k|+1.  Summary: This shows that the integers and the natural numbers are of the same size, a sort of paradox similar to Hilbert's hotel. One thing to note here is that we don't need to make an explicit mention of infinity until the last step. We can make our assignments for finite numbers, prove that the assignment never puts two integers to the same natural number, and then show that the assignment can go over all integers. The lesson from this, and Hilbert's hotel, is that dealing with infinity is usually hard and it can be sensitive, so the approach to take is to somehow reduce it to a problem with finitely sized sets and show that the properties you want carry over in the infinite case."

Edit to be less bluntly: /u/king_of_the_universe has a nice example: Those struggling with infinity should make an effort to replace the brain's substitution of infinity with ""A DAMN LOT!"" instead with ""Always more."" because ""infinite"" means ""with out end"", so in the case of e.g. space or numbers, it would mean ""ongoing"".  That's actually a nice way to imagine infinity and to solve your problem with ""twice as many integers than naturals"". If I were to count the integers and the naturals in you scheme, I would increase the number of integers twice as fast as the naturals, yes. But on what point does it matter? Where is the point when I say ""Okay, I'm done counting and now I know I have twice as many integers as naturals""? Never. Because when I say ""Now, at n=1234567890"" I would've counted a finite set, not an infinite one. No matter to what numbers you have counted so far, countable infinity is even more, there are always enough naturals to fully map the integers from +infinity to -infinity. And back.  To make matters worse, there are also always enough naturals to fully map all rational numbers, but there are not enough natural numbers to map all real numbers between 0 and 1.

askscience,3dwvqv,BNNJ,7,Mon Jul 20 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Good to see you thinking about infinity, certainly one of the more interesting parts of mathematics. It's especially fun because, as this video shows, ideas about infinity can be explored without much more than an elementary maths background.  You say you have an issue with the ideas presented in this video, that's great! In mathematics if you think something is wrong then a really powerful tool to show it is by finding what's called a counterexample, a specific case that doesn't work. Let's deal with the case of fitting that countably infinite bus of people into the hotel. I challenge you to find a counterexample, i.e. a person (from either the bus or already in the hotel) who doesn't find a room. Take the person in seat 1 of the bus, well we put them in room 1 (and she stays there). The person in seat 2, they go into room 3 (and stays there). The person in seat n goes in room 2n+1 (and stays there). Notice everyone from the bus gets put in an odd room?  And as for the hotel, well as the video explains person originally in room 1 is now put in room 2 (and stays there). The person in room 2 goes to room 4 (and stays there). The person who was in room n goes to room 2n (and stays there). Now everyone originally in the hotel is now in an even room.  Everyone moves exactly once. Furthermore, the odd/evenness we brought up makes it pretty easy to see no two people get put in the same room. If you're from the bus you're in an odd room and can't be sharing with an old hotel person. And you can't be sharing with a fellow bus passenger because they weren't sitting in the same seat as you on the bus. This is the same idea of counterexamples as before, namely that we're failing to find one.  As for your string analogy I don't fully understand your wave idea. A better analogy for how the two pieces of string can be in the same place is to introduce the idea of chopping up the strings. Chop the red string every 1cm and then spread them out so there's a 1cm gap in between each piece. Now lay the blue string next to it and chop it every 1cm as well. Again, spread the pieces out but this time slide them into the gaps you created earlier. The reason I did it this was is because mathematically speaking we're doing the exact same thing as we did to the hotel guests. Notice how every 1cm piece of string is only moved once, just like how every guest is only moved once in the hotel example.  Hope that helped. I know infinity is hard but keep thinking about it and you'll wrap your head around it in no time.

For the rucurring decimals, my problem arose in thinking that, because we are writing down an infinite number of 9s, you will always be at least a little bit away from 1. But this isn't infinity, this as an increasing sequence of finitely many 9s.  Instead, think about it in terms of putting all infinitely many 9s down first, using an infinitely long rubber stamp. Then, you can't find ""the end"" of the number, and thus can't calculate a non 0 difference.  Now think about your hotel. Instead of starting at the lower numbers and moving everyone along, move everyone at the same time.  Let's say it takes everyone already in the hotel 5 minutes to move from the their original room n, to their new room, 2n, (some people will have to run pretty fast, but because we are not thinking about this physically, this is ok). Then, after 5 minutes, all of your original guests are accommodated for, they all have an even room.  Now let's empty our bus. Before we start the moving process, give eveyone on the bus a room number based on their coach seat number. Someone sat in seat n, moves into room 2n-1. Everyone on the bus has a room number, all the room numbers are odd, and thus all the newly allocated rooms are empty.  Now, making sure people get a move on, we give everyone 10 minutes to move into their new rooms, which we assume they can do (because we aren't physically doing this). Then after 10 minutes, the hotel is full again, and all our guests have rooms.  TL;DR, think about moving all your guests simultaneously at every stage, rather then one after the other."

Then you have a function (n,o) |-> 2n+o from these objects to the natural numbers. The function assigns one but only one (n,o) object to each natural number (is bijective) therefore there are as many (n,o) objects as natural numbers. What is different about the real numbers is not explained well but the thing is you cannot uniquely assign a natural number to each real number therefore they aren't countable(the set just containing all rational numbers and roots of them and  pi and e and combinations of all those would be countable but that is not the set of real numbers)."

askscience,3dwvqv,ChalkboardCowboy,0,Mon Jul 20 11:36:04 2015 UTC,"What the thought experiment is really an introduction to the idea of the ""cardinality"" of a set. Roughly speaking, cardinality is ""the size of the set."" (The cardinality of a set S is denonted |S|)  This can be thought of in two ways.   Suppose we have a finite set of chairs and a finite set of people, and we want to know if we have enough chairs.  We can either count the number of chairs, and compare that figure to the number of people.  Or we could say ""Everyone grab a chair and sit down"". If there are chairs left over, we know that the chair-set has a higher cardinality than the people-set. If we have people left standing we know that the opposite is the case. If all chairs are occupied and nobody is standing, we know that the chair-set and people-set have the same cardinality.  By saying ""everyone sit down"" we have defined a mapping from the people-set to the chair set. There are three classes of mapping   Injections: Every person gets a chair  Surjections: No chair can have more than one person sitting on it Bijections: Every person gets a chair AND no chair has more than one person sitting on it   Now, if exists an injective mapping between set A and B then we can say |A| &leq; |B|.   If there also exists an injective mapping between set B and set A then |B| &leq; |A|, hence |B|=|A|.  Also, if there exists a bijective mapping between B and A, then |B|=|A| (since a bijective mapping and the inverse of a bijective mapping are both injective).  Whether or not we can visualize it, these mappings can be applied to countably infinite set.  Countably infinite is defined as ""the cardinality of the set of natural numbers N={0,1,2,3...}"" and is denoted &aleph;_0 (that is, &aleph;_0=|N|).  The question posed by the thought experiment boils down to ""what other sets have cardinality &aleph;_0"".  How about the set of even numbers S={0,2,4...}={2n | n &in; N}  Clearly there is an injection from S to N (since S &subseteq; N). So we can use the function f(x) = x. Hence |S|&leq;N  For the other way, from N to S, use the function g(x)=2x. Hence N &leq; S (this is actually a bijection).  So, |S| = N.   It may seem counter-intuitive, but we've just proved that there are as many even numbers as natural numbers (e.g. the 2 sets have the same cardinality).  Now consider the set of integers Z={...-2,-1,0,1,2...}  The mapping from N-> Z is pretty straightforward--it's f(x) = x, again (since the set of integers contains the set of natural numbers).   The other way gets a bit more complex. Define the function g:Z->N such that  g(2n+1) = n+1  (odd numbers) g(2n) = -n         (even numbers)    So,   g(0)=0 g(1)=1 g(2)=-1 g(3)=2 g(4)=-2 ...  So that's basically what the thought experiment is about. All of the different bus-configurations have the same cardinality.  But not all infinite sets have the same cardinality! &aleph;_0 is the smallest order of infinity, but there are bigger ones!  Georg Cantor proved with his diagonal argument that the powerset of a set is strictly larger than the original set. (The powerset of S, denoted P(S), is the set of all subsets of S. For example P({1,2,3})={{},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}).   For finite sets, the cardinality of the powerset is given by |P(S)|=2|S|  The cardinality of P(N), however, is denoted &aleph;_1  So, while &aleph;_0 = 1+&aleph;_0 = 2*&aleph;_0  2&aleph;_0 = &aleph;_1 > &aleph;_0  But I digress."

askscience,3dz8bb,garrettj100,3,Tue Jul 21 06:10:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should first understand a bit about gauge theory. A gauged quantity is much like money. One euro is now 1.08 dollars or 135 yen. But, if you could get $108,000, it wouldn't really matter if you would get €100,000 or Y13,500,000 instead. So, the unit here is arbitrary; the underlying quantity doesn't change.  However, not all real things follow the gauge logic. For example, the strength of the electromagnetic force may be arbitrary, but the ratio between the strength of the electromagnetic force and the strong force isn't.  For the speed of light, current theories treat it as a constant with a value of 1, meaning all other speeds may be expressed as a fraction of it. In this sense, the famous formula E=mc2 answers your question, albeit in a trivial way, since in Planck units, c=1 and E=mc2 is just E=m 12 that is E = m.  Within relativity, you can't change the speed of light without modifying everything else. This is referred to in the source cited on Wikipedia. Thus, the idea of speed of light being a power of 2 in some units is not a simple one, since you would have to redefine distance, time and gravity.  Arguably, one could use pure Planck units, but then it's the same issue as before. The only way to get something fundamental would be to measure the ratio between e.g. Planck energy and the masses of particles we observe. Unfortunately, this may not be as meaningful as you think. Masses can come from many sources and there doesn't need to be one great underlying principle behind them. For example, 99% of proton mass is in strong force field potential energy, and a proton doesn't just contain three quarks but an unholy mess of quarks, antiquarks and gluons. In fact, if the Higgs mechanism didn't work and the Higgs field was zero, all  particles would be massless, except for a very massive Higgs particle. The flavor problem is that there is no ready explanation why the Higgs-particle interaction strength varies with flavor, and why this much. Any ""numerological"" solution of the issue would solve the flavor problem, which would be undisputed Nobel material.  tl;dr: You're trying to solve a very hard problem that nobody has ever been able to solve with inadequate tools."

In a basic sense what was done is that the DNA was crystallized then X-rays were directed through the crystal creating the image now known as Photo 51. The beams going through the crystal are bent at specific angles that are unique to the molecular structure of the crystal. Based on the angles that the X-rays are bent at, Watson and Crick were able to determine that the structure must be a double helix.    I should note the role of Rosalind Franklin here though. She was pretty much solely responsible for Photo 51 and it was shown to Watson without her permission. Watson and Crick went on to work out the structure of DNA and failed to credit her with any contribution. Even though hers was the major contribution. Once the photo was finally obtained it was a matter of math to work out the structure and it's likely that she could have done it herself. That's been the subject of some debate, but it remains clear that she made a major contribution to the work and the two scientists who won the Nobel Prize for the work admittedly omitted her name intentionally."
askscience,3dwktt,AnecdotallyExtant,13,Mon Jul 20 10:07:28 2015 UTC,"Not a tried and true chemist, but I think I may be able to shed at least some light on the diffraction portion.  Note: The type of diffraction used back then, and what is used today (what I learned) are VASTLY different. But I think I can explain why the photo looks the way it does.   A little background first: if you've ever seen the Pink Floyd album cover for dark side of the moon, you have seen the typical diffraction of light through a prism. This was a compete mistake on my part, wrote this too early on a Monday. So, light will diffract through crystals the same way, and not only visible light.  If you shoot x-rays through the crystal, characteristic diffracted x-rays will come out at an angle that is measureable from a datum.  As you change the angle of entry, the exit angle also changes, this exit angle (in relation to the crystalline lattice structure) is known as the 2theta angle, or Bragg angle.  See here.    Now, if you look at that picture and know that shooting x-rays through at an angle of (what appears to be) 15 degrees will only interact with 2 nodes (in reality, it will be much much more). But if you were to change the theta angle to, something closer to 20 degrees, the left and right x-ray lines would change to this.  In this scenario, instead of the x-rays only interacting with 2 nodes, it interacts with 4 nodes.  This (depending on a bucnh of things like x-ray wave length and crystallne spacing) can create ""constructive interference"" where wavelengths of the x-rays (remembering, in this scenario they are waves) line up, so their amplitudes are additive.  This creates a stronger signal at that angle.  So by sweeping through an angular range, you will get different intensities to plot out.  Now, looking at the image that /u/IRLpuddles posted, you will notice that there are dark spots.  Those are the intensity spots from the diffractions at specific angles.  You'll also note that most of the intensities have symmetry around the middle (where the crystal was) and for each set of points on the photo, there are ~4 intense dots at approximately 90 degrees to each other.  But also, inbetween each ""set"" of similar dots is a radially band of less intense diffraction points.  This happened because the crystal is not 2D, it is 3D, therefore to understand the structure, you must spin it while shooting x-rays through the sample.   So while looking at the picture from top down, you are seeing that the sample is spun in the plane of the figure.  Now, how they determined the structure to be helical is based on the math of the diffraction points and (my guess would be) by noticing that the most exterior band of diffraction is NOT radial but a weird truncated diamond shape. Adding onto that, a TON of math, and you work out that it must be doubly helical.  I hope that helps."
askscience,3dwktt,ax7221,9,Mon Jul 20 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"Without looking more carefully at the literature, my first guess would be that the hint at a helical structure comes from systematic absences in the diffraction pattern that indicate screw axis symmetry.  X-ray diffraction analysis allows you to know something about the symmetry of crystals, and different types of symmetry (rotation, inversion, reflection across an axis, glide plane, screw plane, etc.) lead to different absences in the x-ray diffraction pattern.  Certainly there is math involved as well, but an experienced user of x-ray diffraction can get a general impression of a structure more or less at a glance."

askscience,3dwktt,dblmjr_loser,8,Mon Jul 20 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, Watson and Crick were not capable X-ray crystallographers. The woman who DID find this was named Rosalind Franklin. She knew from studies of proteins which are often helical, that she was seeing a helical pattern via her work on DNA using X-ray studies. Watson and Crick took some time finding that out from her, and then were able to take credit for what she found, a double helix, not they. All they did was to add the known Chargaff rules, that adenine=Thymine and Cytosine=guanosine in all known DNA. Then they put the thing together by trial & error.  Sadly, Ms. Franklin died young, possibly due to x-ray exposures. And neither they admitted nor the world knew her VERY critical place in finding DNA molecule's crystalline structure.   Of course in the living cell, DNA is held by histones and other elements of chromatin which allow it to be opened up, transcribed, duplicate and other things such as shutting down genes by methylations. So while DNA is helical, its actual, folding, winding structure while still a double helix is VERY much more complicated than that. Probably far, far more than we humans can EVER comprehend with 3 billions of base pairs spread along in humans inside of 23 pairs of chromosomes.  So, yes, the structure of DNA is a double helix, but it's a double helix ""PLUS"", the complex system of biochemical structures it's nested inside of."
askscience,3dwktt,herbw,6,Mon Jul 20 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"My favorite pet peeve - Rosalind Franklin did not solve the the crystal structure of DNA - she worked on fiber diffraction. DNA crystals have only been available since the 1980's, when oligonucleotide synthesis became feasible (Aaron Klug, Franklin's last graduate student, was one of the people who did the first crystal structures of DNA). IN fiber diffraction linear molecules get more or less aligned by pulling a fiber of a concentrated solution (Think snot)  According to the literature, Watson and Crick were unaware of the results from Chargaff's studies, and honestly, the numbers Chargaff got were not that great and convincing. Instead, they followed Linus Pauling's example and looked for possible configurations of the bases that would give good hydrogen bonding patterns. An issue about tautomerization of on of the bases held them back until they were told what the more energetically advantageous conformation was. Franklin, as a crystallographer, was probably not too fond of the model building that Watson and Crick did. They drew a lot of conclusions from limited data (that one diffraction pattern, that turned out to be really hard to replicate), and I think it would be fair to say that the Double Helix structure for the longest time was little else but a hypothesis - but an extremely fruitful hypothesis"

Much of what we believe of Franklin being 'hard to work with' comes from Watson's own account of the period published in '68. In the intervening years he has recanted that opinion of her. If you read the 2012 edition of the Double Helix they go in to a fair amount of detail on the events and correspondence which led to Watson's initial opinion of her.  And the supplementary material added to the 2012 edition paints her in a much more favourable light than Watson did at the time.

Darwin formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection around 20 years before he published it. He would probably have sat on it for another twenty years if the theory hadn't been independently formulated by Wallace. In fact, Wallace and Darwin were originally co-credited with the idea.      It was another year before the Origin was published. And Darwin is now, rightfully, given the majority of the credit.    Darwin was just as content as he could be sitting on the theory that would be the single largest revolution in biology. But of course history hasn't forgotten who made the major contribution there.     (Edit: And I think you're totally right that Crick doesn't deserve to be vilified.

If Franklin had the answer she would have published it. Watson is a prick and did something between not crediting properly and straight-up stealing Franklin's work, but Watson is the one who had the final insights and gave a complete structure.   In your Darwin/Wallace analogy I would call Watson Darwin, he was the first one who finally put the pieces together. Franklin produced what was perhaps the most important piece, and deserved to share the Nobel as a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, but its not as though she had it all figured out and just got scooped."

So it was quite easy to imagine her the product of an unsatisfied mother who unduly stressed the desirability of professional careers that could save bright girls from marriages to dull men. . . .

TRANSCRIPT   Question: What was Rosalind Franklin’s role in the discovery of DNA?   James Watson: She provided the... some crucial pieces of information.  Her great handicap, which I would now say we would use the term Asperger’s, she didn’t know how to deal with other people; didn’t know how to ask for help. And, if anything, probably paranoid about people stealing her data.  And if she’d come out to Cambridge and shown her data to Crick, she... Crick would have told her how to solve her problem.  She had a clue, but she didn’t know how to interpret it, and Francis would have immediately have told her what it was because his own work in Cambridge, just by accident, had let him deal with that problem.  So he could have told her, and she had gone back to London and he would have said, ""You know, there are two chains and she said the phosphoruses were on the outside then they would have to be held together by the bases.  And once you say that, you are very close to the structure.    So...

She was a chemist (a published one, in fact, with two papers published before Watson and Crick's discovery on the A form). There isn't an uproar about the Franklin controversy because she collected the data and wasn't credited, it was because by all accounts she made the discovery.   Third, I'd be interested to see how many scientists would agree with 'Data collection is the easiest part' (I'm paraphrasing your last line). I think many if not all will tell you that its generating the data thats the hardest part.

A lot more complicated mathematics went into actually computing the numbers for the dimensions of the double helix, however.  See here  It's actually interesting to note that in order for x-ray crystallography to work, they needed (as the name implies) a crystal. DNA does not exist (in vivo) in such a state - they had to dehydrate their samples in order to get a resolvable image, which doesn't necessarily reflect the shape that DNA exists as within our cells.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Alternate_DNA_structures"

This is because when one x-ray photon hits a protein in its natural state, the energy transferred to it causes it to denature, altering its shape. Now, to fix this we would need more than one of the proteins, which is exactly what a protein crystal is. It has regularly repeating patterns of the same protein, and if dipped in liquid nitrogen (which is modern practice, I'm not sure about then) it make the protein crystal even stronger and better able to resist denaturing.   Now, what you're saying about crystal vs. natural state may be true, but we honestly don't know if their forms are altered by this process of crystallization because our current method of imaging requires them to be in crystals, which do not to my knowledge form naturally in any reliable or cost-effective sense."

Based on how far they traveled into the crystal before reflecting, they will interfere differently with other x-rays upon exiting; once you have the diffraction image, then you can work backwards to figure out the structure of the crystal that reflected the photons.  Pretty cool that the periodicity necessary for using diffraction techniques happened to coincide with a technique necessary for avoiding denaturing, though. They got pretty lucky!"

The characteristic ""X"" is the result of Fiber diffraction which is related to X-ray crystallography, but whereas crystal diffraction will allow you to place all of the atoms in space, fiber diffraction can only give you certain parameters for the material being studied.

DNA does not exist (in vivo) in such a state - they had to dehydrate their samples in order to get a resolvable image, which doesn't necessarily reflect the shape that DNA exists as within our cells. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Alternate_DNA_structures[2]     If I remember correctly, Franklin produced crystals for DNA both in the presence and absence of water, which gave details about the structure of B-form and A-form DNA, respectively. It's not that you can't produce crystals with water (quite the opposite) it's that you get different results depending on your conditions."
askscience,3dwktt,dazosan,7,Mon Jul 20 11:52:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, something i can actually help answer! This is the result of something called x-ray diffraction imaging, where crystallized proteins are blasted with focused x-rays, which then diffract. These x-rays are recorded and usually show a scatter pattern resembling concentric circles of dots. This is because most proteins/enzymes are very clustered and do not resemble any actual shape other than a blob, and the image is a composite of many of these same proteins. The results from Picture 51 are special in that its results actually show a very defined X-shape. This shows us just a small piece of the DNA, and since DNA repeats in very long chains, we can apply this model to the entirety of the chain. Then, once we account for 3-dimensions, we can conclude it is a double helix."
askscience,3dwktt,irdk4,2,Mon Jul 20 11:56:28 2015 UTC,"Xray diffraction doesn't yield concentric cirles of dots because proteins are globular; it has to do with the nature of crystal diffraction. Normally a number of images would be collected with the crystal rotated relative to the beam and that would be used to solve the crystal structure. A single image is a slice of points that make up the reciprocal lattice, which is a grid with evenly spaced points where the distance and angles depend on the crystal unit cell. The circles or lunes are caused because the crystal is usually oriented ""crooked"" in the beam, and you can imagine the lunes as the corners of the reciprocal lattice passing throught the image plate. It's impossible to tell DNA and protein crystals apart just by looking at a crystal diffraction image.  Edit: /u/jballanc says the Franklin used fibre diffraction; so if it was 2D fibre diffraction then a single image would suffice to narrow down the DNA structure from the double helix or Paulings triple helix. You could measure the distance between the spots to figure out how wide the strands are and, if the resolution is high enough, determine how far apart the repeating units are (distances between major grooves, etc.)"

askscience,3dwktt,floatablepie,5,Mon Jul 20 12:12:21 2015 UTC,"Others have said some useful things about the biology of the experiment, so I thought I'd chime in and just comment on diffraction real quick.  Diffraction techniques bombard a sample with some kind of particle (in this case, high energy photons, i.e. x-rays) and use a detector to record those x-rays after they are reflected or diffracted by the sample.  The diffraction pattern you're seeing corresponds to interference among those reflected particles. See this image from the Wikipedia page on Bragg's law. Basically, there's a certain (not equal to 100%) probability of these particles reflecting from atoms in the sample, and so some particles will dig deeper into the sample than others before reflecting back out. Particles that go deeper before reflecting will have traveled a longer total distance when they hit the detector than particles that just bounced off the surface. This difference in distance (and therefore phase) causes the particles to interfere; if the distance two photons have traveled when they interfere is off by half of the photon wavelength, then they will interfere destructively and you'll see nothing. Why this is the case is beyond the scope of this post!  But anyway, if you had a very small structure, there wouldn't be enough layers to get meaningful interference, and especially with high energy x-rays most of them might just pass right through.  What if you had a large structure, but it was random and disordered? Then you'd get lots of reflections, but almost every photon would have a different phase than every other. So the interference pattern you get would be random noise.  But, if you have a large enough sample, which is ordered like a crystal, then you'll get bins of photons which have traveled different distances. A large chunk will have reflected from the first layer, a chunk from the second, and so forth. Then, since there are specific and well-separated distances (corresponding to the ordered layers) that reflected photons can travel, you'll have meaningful interference which will contain information about just how separated those layers are.  That's all pretty simplified for a simple layered structure, but as long as you have a degree of order and a large enough sample, you can get information back out of your diffraction data. That's why, as others have noted, you need a DNA crystal for this experiment.  TL;DR: Diffraction works by interfering reflected light which penetrates the sample at a variety of distances.  Sorry, I was going to just ""comment... real quick"" and I got carried away!"
askscience,3dwktt,danielsmw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"In the experiment an X-ray beam is shot at the sample. Most of it just goes through, and the main beam is anyway discarded. The X-rays cause some of the atoms to vibrate coherently. Therefore, the re-emission is not random: the photons leave at the same time, but because they are in different positions, the phase is different and they interfere. The diffraction off the center of the beam then has a diffraction pattern if this distance between atoms is constant. The angle depends on the inverse of the crystal spacing, so the image is a sort of an inverted view of the repeating patterns. Larger structures cause a peak closer to the main beam.  The problem is nevertheless an inverse problem, because the phase information is lost when the pattern is captured as a photograph. One way to solve it is to simulate. Before computers, it could be done with microwaves, as in this physics student lab exercise: www.physics.rutgers.edu/ugrad/205/manuals/bragg.pdf"

They spent this time going over known data and building models based off of said data. One of the most important things was probably chargoffs rule that says the number of adenines = thymines and cytosines = guanines. Watson and crick built many models trying to incorporate everything that was known about DNA, a double helix was one of the contenders before the picture. When one of them (I think crick) saw the picture he immediately knew it was a double helix because of knowledge of x-Ray crystallography (he was writing his dissertation on crystallography) in addition to knowledge of DNA.

Red, yellow, and blue are only primary colors for pigments that act to absorb other wavelengths. So a red shirt does not emit red light, it absorbs every part of white light except red. When you add emitted light together, the primary colors are red, green, and blue instead.   This is all because of the way your eye works. You only have 3 color receptors (cones) in your eyes, sensitive to blue, red, and slightly-bluer-than-the-red-one-so-we'll-say-green. Your green cone is not very different from your red cone because color vision is fairly recent in humans. Most mammals only have 2 cones - red and blue. Some humans have a defective green cone and end up with the same red/blue-only color vision than most mammals have (like dogs, cows, etc). Color blind people aren't really totally ""blind"" to color, they don't just have greyscale vision, but they are dichromats and aren't sensitive to the same color range as the more common trichromats.  As a side note, many birds have four cones: red, green, blue, and one that's sensitive into UV. To a bird, a typical human trichromat could be called ""color-blind"".   When your eye sees photons with a wavelength of 400 nm, they're only picked up by the blue cones. Your brain interprets this as ""violet"". Photons with a wavelength of 520 nm are detected mostly by your ""green"" cone, and also a bit by your ""blue"" and ""red"" cones, and your brain interprets this particular combination of signals as ""green"".

In general, the vast majority of stars with spectroscopic measurements in the early 20th century are/were not moving quickly enough relative to us to have a substantial Doppler shift (as they are moving <0.001c), and they aren't dense enough to have a substantial gravitational redshift. So at the time, no, relativity did not change what people thought about stellar composition. (Other galaxies did have more sizable Doppler shifts, but this didn't extend into regimes where relativity was important until shortly after GR - indeed, in 1920, it wasn't yet agreed upon whether these ""nebulae"" were actually inside the Milky Way or were galaxies all their own.)  Where it gets interesting is in some of the more exotic things that weren't discovered until after relativity was already well understood. Things like distant supernovae and quasars, where a thorough understanding of GR is necessary to make sense of the apparent faster-than-light movement of objects with Doppler shifts at z>1, and neutron stars that are dense enough to have a significant gravitational redshift (in fact, measuring the gravitational redshift of a neutron star is something people are still trying to do, since it would greatly help to figure out how the interior of a neutron star behaves).  So TL;DR it didn't change anything about composition at the time, but it has been key to understanding things that were observed later, and makes important predictions that not only have been upheld, but provides some useful tools that allow for other interesting physics to be done."

I know it's calculated from the frequency or the wavelength, but both formulas just reduce to a scalar?)  I guess my question is kind of moot when you know (as I later found out) that (most?) stars are NOT moving at significant speeds, relative to us, for GR to really matter. (And that anything that does is at the outer edges of the observable universe where there aren't a lot of stars?)  Also, a question that came up as I was putting together this question was, did the usefulness of astronomical spectroscopy go out the window after the conjectures Payne put forth were verified? I'm guessing no, but with all the caveats that came in the twenties (?) it would seem that there would be so many variables to account for."

GR effects are important at even lower redshifts than that, but without it, it's impossible to make physical sense of what's happening at high redshift by relying on special relativity alone.   The stars that we can individually see are all fairly local to us, either in our own Galaxy or in nearby low-redshift galaxies. By the time you get far enough away for the GR effects to matter, you generally can't see individual stars anymore - they just blend together into one diffuse mess. It's not that the stars aren't there, they're just too far away to resolve from one another.

The reason that things like satellites and asteroids burn up is because they have huge velocities when they enter the atmosphere; I'm talking astronomical speeds, like kilometers per second. That's a lot of energy, and a lot of it is going to end up getting dissipated as heat.  Believe it or not, it's not just friction that heats the object, but also compressed air. When a spacecraft or rock enters the atmosphere going really fast, air doesn't have time to get out of the way, and it gets compressed ahead of the object, and if we know our ideal gas law, we know that compression will heat the air.   If you were going slow enough, you'd fall like a normal rock (you know, the kind that doesn't burst into flames). For example, Felix Baumgartner essentially started from rest by jumping from a balloon, so his jump didn't have the same sort of technical issues as a space shuttle re-entering. For comparison, Felix's top speed was about 800 mph, compared to a re-entering space shuttle which is closer to 17,500 mph.   So why don't we just slow down space shuttles so they can re-enter cold, instead of hot? The simple answer is cost. To get a spaceship up to speed you need a big ass rocket with a lot of fuel. In space, you have nothing to grab onto to brake (except maybe the atmosphere), so to slow down you'd need a rocket that's pretty much just as big as the one that got you up there in the first place! And it costs a lot of money, about $20,000 per kilogram of payload, to get stuff into orbit. Why take that fuel with you when you can just build a heat shield? At least the heat shield is reusable."

Getting them from there would be difficult und you cant just aim at a shore. that would be too risky.

So now m_1 * h_2 = m_2 * h_2 => m_1 * (h_1/h_2) = m_2 => m_1 * 0.85 = m_2.   So, effectively the second guy is also 85% of the weight. At 240 lbs the second guy would be 204; 220lbs / 187 ,  190lbs /162 lbs.  These are all well within plausible weights for individuals as well.  Though in this particular case if you pay attention closely, it's actually two people who jump down from the top holding hands. You can see the four legs in flight but it's easy to see the separation at the bottom and when their heads are in the water. In this case, their combined weight would be ~118%/1.18x of the second guys (100/85). If the second guy weighs ~220, that would allow for a female of ~90 lbs and a male of ~170lbs.

No -- there is no part of the universe which has no matter in any observable direction (at least not within our observable universe, and probably not outside of the observable universe either).  On the largest scales, the universe appears to be homogeneous (with the same average density of matter everywhere) and isotropic (looks the same in every direction).  These two conditions together define the cosmological principle and they underlie modern big bang theory -- big bang theory doesn't work without these as assumptions.  Alternative theories also can't explain observations very well without also making these assumptions.   The Universe is (probably) infinite.   ""Probably"" might be a little strong, but the simplest hypothesis consistent with observational data is that of a flat and infinite universe, yes.   There is a finite amount of matter in the universe.   If the universe is infinite in extent, then this is very likely not true.  If the universe has infinite volume and has the same average density everywhere, then the amount of matter in the universe must also be infinite.   The observable universe has a non-zero density of matter.    Yep!   Since the Universe couldn't be composed with the current density to infinity with its finite amount of matter wouldn't that also imply that there is a region of the universe outside of our observable one that would be void of any matter?   If there were a finite amount of matter in a universe of infinite spatial extent, that does seem to be implied.  However, we don't expect there to be a finite amount of matter.   Then also wouldn't that imply some sort of ""structure"" to the universe (e.g. nonzero density region vs zero density region)?   It would imply that, yes.

This page from the NOAA provides a nice description of some of the basics of a tsunami. Aquatic life near shore would be a different story. In a simple sense, as the waves approach a shore line, the wavelength is compressed, increasing the waves height. This leads to the large effects near shore that we associate with tsunami. So if you're a crab living on the beach or something in the shallow intertidal zone, a tsunami could be a very bad day for you, but if you're a fish out in the middle of the Pacific ocean, you would likely not even notice a tsunami passing you by."

Let's assume I'm 180 lbs and can jump 24 inches vertically on Earth.   You just made it really easy for me.   This tells me the maximum amount of work your legs can do, and by conservation of energy:   m g h = (180 lbs) (9.81 m/s^2 ) (24 inches)    is about 500 Joules if you round up a little. Of course, it turns out your mass doesn't matter in a problem like this - it's sort of like Galileo's cannon balls.   If you jump on a rocky body with the density of earth, which is about 5.5 g/cc, I can find the potential energy of an object on the surface of that body which is equal to the work you can do with your legs. That imaginary rock is about 2.4 miles, or 4 kilometers across.  Unfortunately, bodies of this size don't have enough gravity to pull themselves into a sphere, and are generally potato shaped, so it's hard to find something of this size on a list of known solar system asteroids.   But again, comet 67P, where the Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander are, is quite close. This is why it was kind of a big deal that the lander bounced when it first landed - it would have been very easy for it to bounce off and never come back.

Yes, your mass doesn't matter in the sense that if you can jump a maximum height h at sea level on earth then your jumping speed is given by sqrt(2gh), regardless of your mass. On other astrophysical bodies, this could be faster than escape speed. But h will, itself, generally depend on your mass. If I strap a weight to my back, the amount of work my legs can do when I jump won't change much if the weight isn't too heavy. So I'll still have about the same kinetic energy, just with a lower speed (and reaching a lower h).   So, yes, if you treat the height you can jump on earth as a fixed quantity then whether or not you can jump at escape speed on another body is independent of your mass. But it's not really right to say ""your mass doesn't matter in a problem like this"" because if you're going to let your mass vary, you should let your jumping height vary too. How it varies will be some complicated function of your leg muscles' power under various loads, but as a first approximation we should expect h to go inversely with m.  There should also be an estimate of how much you lower your centre of mass by crouching to start the jump. Some of the work your legs do goes into raising your centre of mass again before you leave the ground. If the force your legs can supply is fixed, then on a body with weaker gravity you will have more kinetic energy—and therefore a faster speed—at the moment your feet leave the ground because raising you back up to your standing height takes less work."

It comes down to magnetocrystaline anisotropy, which is basically how easy it is for the magnetisation to point along a certain axis. Some bulk magnets, like a bar magnet, point along the longest axis because it's just more energetically favourable. If you apply a strong enough magnetic field, you can get the magnet to switch the orientation of the north and south, however this might not be very stable and the magnetic moments might re-align themselves to something more favourable over time.   Another thing that comes into play is called magnetostatics. Imagine a standard bar-magnet. You know the field comes out of north and loops around outside the magnet to the south poles. But there is also a field going through the magnet, called the demagnetising field, this field opposes the magnetic orientations within the material is energetically unfavourable. In your 0.5x2 magnet, the number of magnetic moments pointing out of the magnet (which you can imagine as being the start of field lines) are much greater, so there is also a much greater demagnetising field, which means even less favourable.   It is easier to switch the orientations of bulk magnets (what I call bulk is anything over about 100nm thick however consider a big old magnet you could buy in a shop.) is because inside not all the magnetic moments are pointing the same way, because the magnetic domains (regions of likeways orientated magnetic moments) don't always align due to the random grains in the material.

When moving the pegs around, you're always waying the whole setup, so the only difference in weight should be the difference in potential energy depending on how far apart the pegs are.

askscience,3e1d7y,triponer,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. A liquid is defined by the fast translational diffusion (that means arbitrary and random movement within the three dimensions of space) of the atoms or molecules within. That means that any mercury atom which ""sits"" at the surface of the mercury when you spray it will move into the liquid and will be replaced by another atom quickly. The paint will either dissolve in the liquid (unlikely) or will be expelled and form a ""puddle"" of liquid somewhere (most likely at the at the side of the drop or surface) due to surface tension. It would dry at some point but would not stick to the surface as long as no chemical reaction between the metal and paint occurs.  When you shake the sample you add translational energy to the sample which increases atomic movement and creates convection (turbulent or laminar, depending on the shaking motion and vigor). This leads to a more efficient random replacement of the  atoms with shorter residence times at the surface."

The color of light depends on its frequencies, while the color of a substance (paint) depends on what colors it reflects, and what colors it absorbs. So red paint, for example, absorbs all but red light.  To focus purely on light visible by humans - if you had a red light, a green light and a blue light, and shone them all on the same point, they would combine into white* light. This is what your computer screen is probably doing when showing you white, or any other color for that matter - each pixel is composed of different levels of red, green and blue light. This is also known as the RGB color model.  However, if you were to combine red paint, which absorbs all but red light, green paint, which absorbs all but green light, and blue paint, which absorbs all but blue light, you would necessarily get a darker color - black*. Combining paint is something printers need to do, so they need lighter components than red, blue and green - see the CMYK color model.  * this is a bit of an oversimplification, as the exact shade depends on the shade of the components, but the principle remains."

If you take the sunspot pictures when you do the shadow measurements you'll find the sunspots in the same location.1  A naive objection might be, what if the Sun is a disk? No shift in sunspots would be seen!    Then the response would be why is the Sun a circle in both locations? The off-angle location would then see an elliptical Sun.    Then the Sun disk is far away!    A-ha, then we can use the parallel approximation! Further more, the sunspots move across the solar face disappearing to one side and new sunspots, not only that, they skew at the ends implying off-angle viewing.

In the case of Mercury (the only planet lacking an atmosphere) or non-planetary bodies like the Moon or Pluto, I suppose it's possible for something to scrape the planet and then escape, but by definition it wouldn't transfer much kinetic energy to the surface and thus wouldn't leave much of a mark for us to observe. Similarly, a highly tangential impact (i.e., from which the meteor does not escape) would, by definition, expend most of its energy moving rock sideways rather than digging down into the planet, so you'd get a long shallow scrape that would be harder to make out with a telescope than a deep, round crater generated by a head-on collision"

Imagine now that you're standing on top of a ~ 5 story building and you throw a tennis ball as hard as you can horizontally off the edge. By the time the ball hits the ground, it more or less is going straight down (at 15m with no air resistance it will hit the ground at ~ 60 km/hr downwards -- which for most people will be ~ 45 degrees at impact). Now if we're talking about an asteroid, it's going to be a whole lot higher than 15m, in fact the exosphere is 10,000,000 meters high and gravity is pulling even above that. In a best case (?) scenario with this, the asteroid would at the VERY MOST hit at a 45 degree angle, but most impacts will be a lot more direct than that."

Analog speedometers don't literally do any calculations, mind you—they use a magnet and what is essentially a small electric generator to deflect a needle by an angle proportional to your axle's RPM. Then the speedometer is calibrated so the needle's positions line up with the car's actual speed. A slightly flat tire would introduce error relative to this calibration since the wheel's circumference would be a bit smaller than it was calibrated to. This means the number on your speedometer will be slightly higher than your actual speed (so the excuse of, ""My tires are a bit flat, officer,"" isn't going to get you out of any speeding tickets).  Unless your tire is so deflated that it's undrivable, I really doubt this would amount to more than a mile per hour. Perhaps you can do a simple experiment and report back with your results. Use a piece of string to measure your tire's circumference, using a bit of tape to hold in place along the flattened part contacting the ground. Then let some air out and do the same thing. 100%*(full pressure circumference - deflated circumference)/(deflated circumference) will be the percent that your speedometer would overestimate your speed by. I expect it will be quite small. This isn't taking into account the additional friction on a flat tire which will tend to heat it, and the air inside it, up a bit more than the fully inflated one. (Note that this heating, and therefore expanding, of the air in your tire is why your car manual probably tells you to measure your tire pressure cold, not after you've been driving a while)."

It might be bigger at other points but this doesn't count.

But on earth it is very difficult to observe directly. There was gravity probe B, a probe designed to observe it directly. And it succeed, but due to a hick-up in its design, only  barely so.  One way to think about it is in terms of a gravitomagnetic field. Strictly speaking this is only a weak field approximation to general relativity, yet it is good enough to catch most frame dragging effects. Gravitomagnetic fields are completely analogous to magnetic fields, in the sense, that they are generated by moving electric/mass charges, i.e. a rotating mass/electric sphere also generates gravitomagnetic/magnetic field around it.

At sea level the pressure change with height is about 0.01 kPa per meter. So assuming the passenger compartment of your car is 2 meters long, during strong acceleration there will be about a 20 Pascal pressure difference from front to back.

The succinct answer to your question is twofold:   No massive object can travel at the speed of light. So already your question is ill posed. Any object (necessarily massless) traveling at the speed of light has no rest frame. So even if you rephrase to ask something like ""what does the universe look like to a photon?"", the question is still unanswerable. Photons have undefined ret frames.   Photons have no rest frames because such a frame is not consistent with the axioms of SR: (1) laws of physics are invariant across inertial frames and (2) the speed of light is the same at all times, at all places, and in all inertial frames. Long story short, the Lorentz transformations directly show that an inertial frame must move at velocity v < c with respect to any other inertial frame. Photons also travel on so-called ""null geodesics"", paths on which the invariant interval ds2 = 0 at all points. These last two properties reinforce the fact that photons have no rest frame."

However, once we start to talk about elliptical orbits, it gets a little more complicated. If we imagine an object with an orbit that is below the altitude of our forming planet most of the time, but intersects the planet's orbit at its high point, this object will be moving slowest at this point, slower than anything in a circular orbit at that altitude (such as the planet). The reverse is true for objects orbiting mostly higher than the planet's orbit.  Though this addresses your actual premise, I'm not sure if it's the actual reason most planets rotate counterclockwise."
askscience,3e0l32,jb0ne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"Insects aren't exactly known for their mental prowess and most of the work on insect learning has been in the social Hymenoptera. But for the most part insects rely on fixed action patterns (FAPs). These are basic sequences of behaviors that kind of follow very simple rules.     The dung beetles for instance have rules that say: Rule 1: ""Make ball out of dung."" Rule 2: ""Roll ball away."" Rule 3: ""Bury ball/lay eggs/guard.""      And they really wont do anything else until a rule has been followed. But they don't have a rule that says ""Accept pre-made ball of dung."" And they wont do that. They must follow their rules in order. So if you give them a ball of dung before they've made theirs they will ignore that ball and follow their rule. Once rule 1 is complete they can move on to rule 2. Notice rule 2 says nothing about turning. So they go in a straight line. Notice also that rule 2 says nothing about making a ball of dung. If you take theirs away, they wont go back and make a new one. They'll try to find the one they've lost. If you move them back to the dung they'll search for it there. (They really aren't very bright.) But interestingly, now they'll also accept a pre-made ball. Since they've performed rule 1, they are now only obsessed with rule 2. So if you take away their ball and give them a new one, they're okay with that at this point and they will follow rule 2.     Once they've found a suitable spot, it's on to rule 3. Now they've forgotten all about rules 1 & 2 and are only interested in burying the ball.       So they really aren't learning any of that behavior, and they can't even figure out how to do it until they've completed all of the necessary steps to get up to where ever they are in their FAP.     This is how most insect behavior works it's all FAPs and there is really almost no learning. The exception being the social insects. They will learn a lot from their hive mates, but even this is a fixed pattern. Bee one tells her sisters where to fly; they learn the pattern and all fly in the right direction.      So to answer your question. It's never taught, and they have very specific rules about it. So they'll always perform the tasks in the same ways."

Galaxies are incredibly sparse beasts, with stars and other bodies occupying a tiny fraction of a percent of their volume. When galaxies collide the odds are decent that no two stars will hit each other. That's not to say that it can't happen or that it doesn't happen, it's just that the vast overwhelming majority of stars don't collide.  That's also not to say nothing interesting happens. Near misses, which are more common than direct hits, can disrupt planetary systems, and eject planets from their orbit. Gas clouds too, which are much wider than stars, can collide head on and get compressed and heated, triggering star formation. Lastly, and most interestingly, the super massive black holes in the centers of the two merging galaxies will sink to the center of the new galaxy and find each other, forming a super massive black hole binary. As this binary orbits over the next couple million years it will decay by radiating gravitational waves until they merge, forming an even bigger super massive black hole."

The binary contracts by transferring angular momentum and energy to surrounding gas and stars, particularly through slingshot interactions, until the binary separation is about 0.01 pc, which is when gravitational wave radiation takes over.  The difficulty with this model is getting enough mass through the binary so that it can reach the point gwaves can take over- most solutions require some replenishment where distant 3 body interactions eject a star towards the binary. The problem is that this isn't fast enough - we don't observe many SMBH binaries so they have to coalesce quickly. This is called the final parsec problem.   Hopefully aLIGO can put some better constraints om the merger timescale"

For instance, we can see multiple galaxies outside the Milky Way with the naked eye as it is now, and such galaxies would be even more easily seen without the moon, stars within our own galaxy, or light pollution."
askscience,3dtuyy,seamustheseagull,2,Mon Jul 20 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"Do you have any view on the effect humans would be subject to by any velocity change in our orbit/new course? By that I mean, could Earth being torn from orbiting the sun be felt?"
askscience,3dtuyy,NonsensicalParadise,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Without an actual impact, the realistic answer is no, we wouldn't feel it. The earth's gravity dominates everything on its surface, so gravitationally displacing the orbit of the earth wouldn't be ""felt"" by us. It would also probably be a slow and gradual process, by that I mean over hours or days, so there wouldn't be any moment of a ""hard jerk"" on the earth."
askscience,3dtuyy,seamustheseagull,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"Really depends on whether you're talking about Earth or the entire system being flung out into intergalactic space.  Just earth, then earth's velocity would need to increase by roughly 50% to achieve escape velocity. In effect, we would continue on our existing course, but not orbiting around the sun. So there would be a period of days, perhaps weeks or months, where we are still well within the habitable zone of the sun. However, as we are moving away from it, there will be an instant and noticeable decline in the amount of energy received from the sun. Every day will be measurably colder than the average and pretty soon daytime temps across the planet will be zero (celsius) or less.  With the sun's energy reduction, the weather will go nuts. The heating and cooling currents will be massively changed, resulting in unpredictable patterns.  After just a couple of weeks, harvests will fail, plants will begin to die. We will burn through our food resources insanely quickly as we continue to consume food and produce relatively very little. The number of human individuals still alive after the first 6 months would likely be six figures or less. Famine, disease and violence will take nearly everyone.  This will continue as we move away from the sun, though there is a baseline temperature that the planet will hit as there is significant geothermal energy released. Some life will likely survive on earth for thousands if not millions of years, provided that it's not reliant (directly or indirectly) on sunlight.   The sun will remain visible for a long time. But we would reach Jupiter's orbit in around 18 months, and pass Pluto's orbit in 10-12 years. At that stage practically all animal and plant life will be dead. Some small human groups may survive in bunkers with fossils fuels providing their essential needs, but outside will be basically like Antarctica, so gathering new resources will be effectively impossible.  Some group may hit the jackpot and find themselves located somewhere with high geothermal activity and a lot of fossil fuels so they can develop some kind of sustainable existence. But in reality the human race would be at most a couple of decades from extinction, depending on how much fuel and resources they've managed to hoard before outside become too inhospitable."
askscience,3dtuyy,KrazyKukumber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:37:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking something more along the lines of the entire system being flung, would there be any relevance if the solar system was freeroaming outside of a galaxy?"
askscience,3dtuyy,Zarmazarma,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"Probably not a lot from our perspective. That's assuming the relevant gravitational forces didn't affect our orbit or the orbits of the other planets in our system. It's improbable we would get away without the entire system being thrown into chaos, but let's assume we get lucky.  The sun is thrown into an escape trajectory out of the galaxy, which is roughly 550km/s. The first things we would notice would be the changes in the layout of the stars.  It would be subtle at first, probably unnoticeable to the human eye, but astronomers would notice it pretty quickly, that the redshift of various objects had changed and things aren't quite exactly where we thought they'd be. But actual star constellations in the sky would probably stay relatively steady, shapes changing noticeably to the human eye every couple of hundred years. See, galaxies are big. Even at 550km/s, you're only travelling roughly 17 billion km per year. Or 0.0018 light years. At the conservative side, the galaxy has a radius of 50,000 light years, and we're about halfway out. So it would take close to 28 million years* to officially ""exit"" the galaxy. But even then, the milky way would take up most of the night sky. But at that stage for parts of the year where the sun is between the earth and the galaxy, the nights will be almost starless, and progressively more and more starless over the hundreds of thousands of years that follows.  Eventually when the system moves out by about 1 million light years (half a billion years in real time), for part of the year you will see the entire galaxy in the night sky, and the other part of the year, you will see nothing...except a lot of other galaxies. Andromeda is about 2.5m light years from us and in the night sky is slightly bigger than the moon. But the background light of the Milky way effectively drowns it out. Without that background light, you will see not a completely dark night, but hundreds, even thousands of galaxies. Not quite like the famous hubble shot, but it would be a spectacular sight nevertheless.  Other than that, the actual effects here on the ground would be minimal. From from our perspective we're basically a closed system, getting all of our energy from the sun. Provided the sun stays put relative to us, then life is good.  *I'm ignoring the fact that velocity will slow as we exit the galaxy, so the real time could twice this or more. Does it really matter?"
askscience,3dtuyy,KrazyKukumber,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:24 2015 UTC,The density of galaxies is like a handful of golf balls scattered over all of Europe   How close is this to being actually accurate?
askscience,3dtuyy,EvOllj,3,Mon Jul 20 10:29:42 2015 UTC,"The mass of the Milky Way isn't perfectly measured, but we'll say it's about 1.2x1012 solar masses. It has a volume of about 8 trillion cubic light years. That gives it an average density of about 3.5 x 10 ^ -19 kg / cubic meter.   If you replaced the entire earth with about 8300 golf balls, the new system would be about as dense."
askscience,3dtuyy,VeryLittle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:12:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Just to be clear, you're talking about the golf balls being contained within the volume of the Earth (so, imagine they're floating around between core and surface), whereas that other guy was talking about scattering them on the surface. Right?"
askscience,3dtuyy,SnickeringBear,15,Mon Jul 20 11:23:36 2015 UTC,"very unlineky, very roughly...  stars are lightyears apart and lightseconds in diameter.  so your odds are roughly  1 second divided by as many seconds as in a year, except in 3d space this value is taken to the power of 3.  by this rough approximation, your odds of of randomly appearing stars taking up the same space, within the space that stars occupy on average, is roughly 1/1023"
askscience,3dtuyy,VeryLittle,23,Sun Jul 19 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"I like that approximation, but I think it would be more fair to say that the collision probability goes like the square, not the cube. The reason being that the galaxies are essentially going to be projected onto each other, area-wise, making the square behave like a collision cross-section. That gets you closer to 1 / (3 x 107)2 ~ 1015  Assuming a generous estimate of 1 trillion stars, that's 10-3 collisions per merger."
askscience,3dtuyy,Spirko,3,Sun Jul 19 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"Still off by orders of magnitude.  You can still calculate this and it is not that difficult.  The odds are roughly 72,000,000 to 1 of a given star being involved in a collision when two galaxies pass through each other.  Do the math.  Start with 200 Billion stars in each galaxy, 90% of them will be small stars in the brown dwarf to slightly larger category.  Calculate the cross-sectional area of all the stars vs the diameter of each galaxy (roughly 150,000 light years).  Then calculate the effect of gravity which can turn a near miss into a direct hit.  I've read this repeatedly over the years that the odds of a collision are ""astronomical"".  I submit to you that this can be calculated with a reasonable level of accuracy."
askscience,3dtuyy,Ballongo,26,Sun Jul 19 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"72,000,000 to 1    I had to do some digging to find where this number came from. Looks like ""Fusion Bear"" on galaxyzooforum came up with this figure. He did the original work in this other thread though.   I went through the calculation and found his error. He used miles as his unit, and didn't use scientific notation, so it was a little cumbersome to follow his math, and he made a few errors in the coefficients but nothing that drastically changed the order of magnitude up until this line:   Now take the 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 mile diameter of the galaxy as a whole and divide by the diameter of the smoothed star surface area and use some simple math  to take 6,000,000,000/85 = 70,600,000.   His methodology was good until there. He takes the diameter of his area of interactions to be 100,000 light years across, basically the diameter of a galaxy. Then, he calculates the total area occupied by stars, but then he takes the square root to find the diameter of a circle that these stars would fill up. This is incorrect - he should instead be squaring his galactic diameter/radius and then take the ratio to compare the area that his stars occupy to the total area of the disc.   Redoing his calculation from this step, comparing areas instead of diameters, you get:    120 billion * (500000 miles)2 / (100,000 light years)2    is 8.6x10-14, so we can just round to 10-13. That means that with 120 billion stars (1011), you get an event rate of about 10-2, similar to my figure."
askscience,3dtuyy,SnickeringBear,2,Sun Jul 19 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Isn't that 10-2 per star in one galaxy?  Edit:  Nevermind.  You did multiply by 120e9 twice, to account for the stars in both galaxies."
askscience,3dtuyy,farticustheelder,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:18 2015 UTC,1% per star or per merger? Sounds either too high or low.

askscience,3dtuyy,AmericanPopMusic,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:44 2015 UTC,If the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy collision is a merger event then the likelihood of objects colliding rises to certainty as the two central black holes will eventually 'collide' and merge.  Best not get too close.
askscience,3dtuyy,TakoyakiBoxGuy,4,Sun Jul 19 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"None of you guys are calculating the effects of the gravity of stars and planets, or the ejection of material and energy after a collision.  There will be a beautiful chaos.  So much destruction, but at the same time so many wonderful new creations."
askscience,3dtuyy,ViaMoon24,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:29 2015 UTC,"I believe the thought is that because of the relative ""emptiness"" of space large objects like stars and planets will be too far apart for gravity to cause many collisions."
askscience,3dtuyy,Imaharak,4,Sun Jul 19 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"I think he is referring to the effects of near-misses.  Collisions are rare, but a large star passing close enough to a planetary system could disrupt orbits and possibly eject them.  If you allow the ""hit area"" to be as large as the gravitational well of a star, it could very well cause some disruption.  Gas clouds and nebulae are quite large, and could ""collide"" as well, triggering more rapid star formation.  Other could be ripped apart by passing massive objects."
askscience,3dtuyy,Rustyramrod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"There will probably be no collisions, but gravity between stars and other objects will definitely have a great effect when this happens.

askscience,3e0c9i,_______DEADPOOL____,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"Flat spacetime does not need any energy content.  A spacetime without any energy-momentum content in its equilibrium configuration stays perfectly flat. This is the ""normal"" state for spacetime. As soon as you introduce energy-momentum, it curves.  Now, spacetime is not alone: it hosts a set of quantum fields. These fields are those who give rise to matter when excited. However, even in their ground state (called the ""vacuum"" state because there are no particles) they still have an energy, called ground energy or vacuum energy.  So the emptiest possible spacetime has still vacuum energy. Therefore it will not be flat. Vacuum energy acts as dark energy/cosmological constant, so it induces an exponential expansion of space (which in terms of spacetime, is curvature).  Now, our Universe right now is at a turning point between being dominated by normal, ""dust"" matter (mostly dark matter + our usual visible matter) and being dominated by dark energy/vacuum energy. After this turning point, dark energy will take over and the expansion will be exponential."
askscience,3e0c9i,rantonels,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:10:44 2015 UTC,"If you believe quantum physics then no - the uncertainty principal says that the universe can always borrow energy for a small amount of time, as long as it's given back again. This means that the vacuum is full of virtual particles coming into existence and then disappearing again. This means there will always be something in empty space."

With a bit more heat from the sun Mars would become more habitable than it is today but it would still be a harsh dead place due to it's thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field.  Also, it's likely that the sun would eventually get too hot for Mars as well, so there may be a brief warm era on Mars until it gets burnt out like Earth"
askscience,3dt5ra,MostlyDisappointing,297,Sun Jul 19 09:09:40 2015 UTC,"Is there anyway to sort of ""kickstart"" Mar's magnetic field so to speak?  Also I'm curious if it'd be possible to strengthen it's atmosphere so that Human's could breathe it."
askscience,3dt5ra,Freekling,482,Sun Jul 19 10:54:06 2015 UTC,Mars is a lot smaller than earth and lost its magnetic field because the core of the planet cooled down a lot faster.  Without a liquid core there's no way for a dynamo effect to produce a magnetic field.  So the only way would be to periodically replenish the atmosphere of mars.  But we'd still be talking about millions of years before solar wind does any kind of measurable damage.
askscience,3dt5ra,t_Lancer,181,Sun Jul 19 11:12:00 2015 UTC,"Mars probably never had enough metal for an earth like magnetic field. At half the diameter of earth, it only has about 1/10th the mass."
askscience,3dt5ra,Splorz,291,Sun Jul 19 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ganymede has a magnetosphere, despite being smaller and less massive than Mars.  I don't think anyone is quite sure why it has a magnetic field, but the point is that Mar's E: Mars's size alone doesn't sufficiently explain it.  Also, apparently it's likely that Mars used to have a magnetic field.  From the wikipedia page on Mars:   Although Mars has no evidence of a current structured global magnetic field,[41] observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, and that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals has properties that are similar to the alternating bands found on the ocean floors of Earth."
askscience,3dt5ra,doppelbach,213,Sun Jul 19 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"I imagine tidal forces between Ganymede and Jupiter keep it's core liquid and prevent it from cooling off. This is just pure speculation, though..."
askscience,3dt5ra,Seventytvvo,79,Sun Jul 19 13:50:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely right. The pull from jupiter and the synchronous orbit of the moons creates a bunch of tidal forces. The most extreme version is Jupiter's closest moon, Io."
askscience,3dt5ra,lennon3862,21,Sun Jul 19 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"So could we ""re-warm"" Mars' core and therefore kick-start its magnetic field by throwing a couple more moons around it?"
askscience,3dt5ra,MarauderIIC,24,Sun Jul 19 18:05:41 2015 UTC,"No, the tidal forces of the planet cause the moon to compress and expand as it rotates and orbits due to the difference in force as you move away for the planet. The difference in force has to be great and is most greatly effected by proximity.  As you can imagine such a gargantuan mass overtime would produce enormous heat. However, a smaller body cannot do this, especially to a larger one. Take a gander at the earth-moon system the most the moon does to our planet is pull our oceans and the earth doesn't come close to deforming the moon."
askscience,3dt5ra,Callidus32,26,Sun Jul 19 18:30:36 2015 UTC,The earth does deform the moon. But the moon and earth are now tidally locked so the deformation doesnt change.. no heat generated.  http://scitechdaily.com/nasa-scientists-measure-deformation-moon/

Jupiter does actually produce heat, and emits more energy than it receives from the sun.  But remember, Jupiter is a long way away from the sun.  The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is still far far below 0 C.  The 'heat' given off by Jupiter is not even close to sufficient to melt water ice on its moons.  Several orders of magnitude too little."

askscience,3dt5ra,MBloomberg,2,Sun Jul 19 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"That begs the question of how the atmosphere on Venus stays intact, being that it's closer to the sun?"
askscience,3dt5ra,Helassaid,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Several reasons.  The TL;DR is that Venus' atmosphere is very dense, and can basically deflect the solar wind in its ionosphere, which heats and compresses the solar wind.  The upper atmosphere basically forms a bow shock, which deflects it.  See http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/interact_solwind/ for details."
askscience,3dt5ra,TakoyakiBoxGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"More importantly, with its greater mass, Venus has a significantly higher escape velocity than Mars, meaning it's much more difficult for atmospheric molecules to escape the planet."

Even if we had 1,000x as much on hand, we can only reach one conclusion  We do not have enough uranium.

The spread out would be more effective for getting the core spinning, but the energy release would be the same, so you would need enough energy to heat up the core.  Also, the core would not hold its heat, as it lost its heat before, so theoretically it would need to be reheated periodically."
askscience,3dt5ra,JagdPhoenix_13,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"Yea, it the separate smaller nukes would have the same yield, but rather than just blasting a single spot with a few hundred million degrees, you could hit multiple spots with just a few dozen million. I would think that that would be more effective in melting/heating up the entire core all at once.  On the topic of it eventually cooling, though, how does Earth's core stay hot? Will ours eventually cool?"
askscience,3dt5ra,DasJuden63,4,Sun Jul 19 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the core of Mars has cooled down enough to solidify.

askscience,3dt5ra,jdepps113,4,Sun Jul 19 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"Well for one you forget about pressure. Heat isn't the only thing that stops us from reaching the core on our planet. Even though mars is a third of our size, there would still be a massive amount of pressure the closer to the center you go.  Secondly is getting the equipment to mars.

askscience,3dt5ra,2BigBottlesOfWater,32,Sun Jul 19 14:24:51 2015 UTC,Main theory is that the magnetic field deflects solar wind that would otherwise blow the atmosphere off.   http://m.space.com/11187-earth-magnetic-field-solar-wind.html
askscience,3dt5ra,Jake_2M,15,Sun Jul 19 14:29:34 2015 UTC,"This is an idea that has fallen out of favor. Most popular now is just that mars being sufficiently hot and having sufficiently weak gravity just is not able to gravitationally hold onto an atmosphere.

A magnetic field stops one kind of atmospheric loss process. However, there are many, many different kinds of atmospheric loss process, most of which are insensitive to whether there is a magnetic field - and some of which only occur with a magnetic field such as polar outflow."
askscience,3dt5ra,Astromike23,9,Sun Jul 19 21:50:15 2015 UTC,A magnetic field is essential for life on Earth because it effectively blocks a lot of harmful radiation from the Sun.
askscience,3dt5ra,neman-bs,6,Sun Jul 19 14:34:55 2015 UTC,"This is not actually entirely true. It does act as a shield for charged particles that is true, but it also concentrates the radiation near the poles and the radiation has no effect on the life living below due to our thick atmosphere.    Even if the whole magnetic field were to vanish for several hundred years to a thousand years, it wouldn't make living on the surface any different. The atmosphere is thick enough to block practically all meaningful high energy particle radiation coming from the Sun and the magnetic field does in fact vanish periodically every 250,000 years or so...and it has already begun weakening again for a new flip.    There is no correlation in the fossil records of any ill effect for not having a magnetic field when it has been gone for several hundred to a thousand years in the past. Life continued as normal completely unaffected by it.    Even if the field were to vanish entirely, the atmosphere is thick enough to protect us and the mantle hot enough to keep the atmosphere for the next few billion years at least.    That being said: we are all dead within just 80-150 million years anyway. The Sun is slowly increasing in luminosity as we speak and within 90-150 million years it has become just 5-7% brighter which is enough to boil away every ocean in the world and sterilize the surface."

So the only way would be to periodically replenish the atmosphere of mars.   Even with a magnetic field, Mars would still be leaking atmosphere into space. It has a much lower escape velocity, so it's much easier for atmospheric molecules to gain escape velocity. Since molecular velocity is a function of temperature, this atmospheric loss process is a simply a function of the upper atmosphere temperature and the low gravity - this has nothing to do with whether there's a magnetosphere or not."

Just a few megawatts of power would probably deflect the solar wind a good bit, deflect some cosmic rays, etc. If you want to enhance or diffuse the field according to need, get some automated robots to stack up iron ore around the cables.   That's the boring way. The crazy way would be to have a ring of bucky cable orbiting around mars, and a bunch of tethers dropping down into the atmosphere and conducting current. You don't actually even have to push much current over the lines since you'll pick up current from the solar winds on a cable that huge. The tethers would be there to spread out the magnetic field, and try to dump some of the current.

That represents when Earth exits the Habitable Zone. At this point nothing can stop the temperatures from increasing and Earth will become a Venus clone.  An Earth-sized Mars would be the same. It would have Earth-like temperatures despite being farther from the sun because this climate-regulating feedback mechanism would give it much higher levels of CO2.

askscience,3dwhsb,FrequentlyHertz,18,Mon Jul 20 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"This is a fun effect. It is precession, as you claim. But the reason for the apparent, very abrupt change in the rotation axis is not obviously clear. Rather than explain the details myself, I will let Terence Tao do it for me. He has a very good explanation on this Stack Exchange post. His response is readable from someone with little math or physics background. You just need to be able to visualize the disc he is describing.  If you want some more background, he is assuming the object is a freely moving rigid body (i.e., no external forces), which is a safe assumption since this video was shot in outer space. Any rigid body has three so-called principal moments and axes of inertia. It is a well-known result that rotation about the second principal axis (i.e., the axis whose moment of inertia has a value in between the other two) is unstable. If an object is initially rotating about the second principal axis, any small perturbation will not cause a small periodic motion of the rotation axis (which is precession). The small perturbation will cause an instability. In the video, the instability manifests itself by causing the rotation axis to periodically switch orientation.  I should note that Terence explains the effect for an object whose first moment of inertia is small, and whose second and third moments are unequal but close. Instability about the second axis occurs as long as the three moments are unequal. There is no requirement for their relative values. However, if the first is small and the second and third are close, the effect of the instability is quite dramatic, as seen in the video. By ""dramatic"" I mean that the object seems to be rotating very stably about an axis until it abruptly does a half-twist. What is really happening is that the rotation was unstable all along, but the closeness of the values of the second and third moments means that the instability grows more slowly than if they were very different values.  This picture might help if you are familiar with some of the math. It's difficult to explain succinctly all of the math behind this picture. Essentially, the sphere is meant to be a surface of constant energy. (Since kinetic energy is like v2 = (dx/dt)2+(dy/dt)2+(dx/dt)2, you can see where spheres come into the picture.) The curves on the sphere are then the intersection of this sphere with ellipsoids, of varying semiaxes. The ellipsoid is a surface of constant squared angular momentum. Cut to the chase... the curves correspond to the precessions of the rotation axis if the object is given a perturbation away from a principal axis. Now this is where you need to have some imagination. This sphere is not the object per se. So imagine squashing this sphere into an ellipsoid in the following way: squash the I1 direction so that the ellipsoid is very thin in that direction. Then squash the ellipsoid in the I2 direction only very slightly so it is not equal, but very close to having the same thickness in the I3 direction. All of the curves should appropriately deform.  Note the X-shaped curve in the original picture. Just consider the left half of it (in the direction of the arrows). You can think of this curve as V-shaped, if looked at from the side. Better yet, the curve looks like the upper part of a taco shell. (Yes, that's just a picture of a taco.) What happens to this curve after we squash the sphere? Well, we still have a taco, but one with a very large opening. The top edge of the taco is basically just two semicircles, that are spaced very far apart. Remember that this curve is meant to be the path of a rotation axis. What happens? When the rotation axis is close to either of the vertices of the taco, the object looks like it's just spinning calmly, minding its own business. But the rotation axis is very slowly moving along the upper edge of the taco, but it is gaining speed. At some point, it is moving so fast so as to appear to traverse the entire edge of one half of the taco shell in almost an instant. When the rotation axis has reached the other vertex of the taco shell, it has reversed direction. Now the process starts again. The rotation axis is moving very slowly, but then speeds up very fast to traverse the other edge of the taco shell in an instant, reversing direction again. This reversal is periodic and is, strictly speaking, precession about the first principal axis, although it does not look like that at all from the video.  For more of the fine details of this subject in general, any good classical mechanics text should have a section on the motion of rigid bodies. I originally learned from Thornton and Marion's text, which is geared toward undergraduates. Goldstein's and Saletan's graduate texts (they are two separate authors, two separate texts) are my most common personal reference texts for mechanics.  edit: I really like this video. It's in Russian, which I don't understand. I assume the interviewee is explaining the effect. Around the 0:30 mark, you can watch a slow motion video of a screw undergoing this rotation. (It moves to the left in the video because it has some initial linear momentum from when it was unscrewed off some bolt.) At around the 1:00 mark, the slow motion is replayed, but with an overlay to show you the rotation axis of the object in real time (in red). The blue axis is just so you can orient the object in 3D for yourself. If you imagine ignoring the overall motion to the left, you can see the taco shell curve that the red line traces in space.  edit 2: This video is also really good in showing the general phenomenon that a perturbation from rotation about the second principal axis is unstable. This is seen in the ""tennis racket theorem"" video when the paddle performs a half-twist right after it flips over from red to black. (This is the last demonstration in the video that starts at about the 1:10 mark.). This video shows several home demonstrations, using an empty cereal box, a tennis racket, and some novelty toys."

It describes situations very similar to this where a series a small perturbations to a system continue until a moment of ""catastrophe"" where a major change then happens out of seemingly nowhere. Thanks!"
askscience,3dwhsb,babeltoothe,3,Mon Jul 20 07:15:30 2015 UTC,"Catastrophe theory is really a subject of the more general bifurcation theory, which is not exactly the same as what I described above.  In bifurcation theory, an example of a basic setup is a system described by some parameter S. For some range of values of S (for example, S>0), the system has a stable equilibrium. But if S<0, the system may have no stable equilibrium. The point S = 0 is said to be a bifurcation point because the stability properties of the system change abruptly at S = 0. Another typical example of bifurcation theory might be a system in which there is only one stable equilibrium for S>0, but for S<0 there are multiple stable equilibria, possibly not even including the original equilibrium from S<0. The point S = 0 is again said to be a bifurcation point.  For the case of rigid body motion with three unequal moments of inertia, rotation about the first and third principal axes is always stable. Rotation about the second axis is always unstable. The relative values of the principal moments of inertia, which are the parameters that entirely describe the stability regions, are not important, only that are unequal. For a fixed body with unequal principal moments (like in the various videos linked above), I'm not really sure how you could frame the problem as a bifurcation problem.  The closest related problem I can think of is considering continuously changing a principal moment. Consider an ellipsoid (x/a)2+(y/b)2+(z/c)2 = 1, with unit mass and a>b>c. The principal moments of inertia are    Ixx = (b2+c2)/5  Iyy = (c2+a2)/5  Izz = (a2+b2)/5   The principal axes are, respectively, the x-, y-, and z-axes. We have that   Ixx < Iyy < Izz   so that this is also the order of the first, second, and third principal moments. Hold a and b fixed, while changing c. If we decrease c, the order of the moments never changes, and, therefore, the stability region never does either. That is, rotations about the x- and z-axes are always stable, with rotations about the y-axis unstable. If we instead increase c, then the stability properties change abruptly when c = b. In that case, we no longer have unequal principal moments. We have   Ixx < Iyy = Izz   It turns out that with one pair of equal moments with the other moment unequal, stable rotations exist only about the axis corresponding to the unequal moment (regardless of its relative size to the equal pair). So rotations about the y- and z-axes are unstable, with rotation about the x-axes stable. If we continue to increase c, so that a>c>b, then the order of the principal moments changes. We get   Ixx < Izz < Iyy   There is an abrupt change of stability properties. Now the z-axis is unstable, but the x- and y-axes are stable. Increase c until a = c > b. At that point, the y-axis is the only stable axis. Increase c until c>a>b. At that point, the only unstable axis is the x-axis. This is all summarized in the following table.    Axis a>b>c a>b=c a>c>b a=c>b c>a>b    x-axis ✓ ✓ ✓ X X   y-axis X X ✓ ✓ ✓   z-axis ✓ X X X ✓    The checkmarks and X's denote stability and instability, respectively, of rotations about that axis."

Another typical example of bifurcation theory might be a system in which there is only one stable equilibrium for S>0, but for S<0 there are multiple stable equilibria, possibly not even including the original equilibrium from S<0. The point S = 0 is again said to be a bifurcation point.   Could you not describe the 3 moments of inertia as multiple stable equilibria, and the system is switching between them (where one switches from stable to unstable, and another vice versa) at critical points? The bifurcation would just be the critical point where enough instability is added to the stable principle axis and enough stability is added to the unstable principle axis, and the switch happens.   Or am I missing some critical difference in the intuition? For me I see catastrophe theory as how small changes to a state in a stable equilibrium can create sudden shifts from one stable equilibrium to another.

askscience,3dwhsb,babeltoothe,3,Mon Jul 20 08:29:35 2015 UTC,"The bifurcation would just be the critical point where enough instability is added to the stable principle axis and enough stability is added to the unstable principle axis, and the switch happens.   This is not right and likely a source of your confusion. When we talk of stable equilibrium, we mean with respect to small perturbations. For instance, consider the potential   V(x) = -A*(x2-1)4   in one-dimensional motion. This is the graph of the potential, with A = 1. The equilibrium points are at x = -1, 0, 1. The equilibrium point at x = 0 is stable and corresponds to a total energy of E = -1. There are two more or less equivalent ways of considering a small perturbation.   We can start the particle from rest at a point close to the equilibrium point, say at x = δ, where δ is small.   OR   We can start the particle at the equilibrium point with some (small) extra energy, say E = -1+ϵ, where ϵ is small.   The concept of ""small"" here is a bit ambiguous. But the idea is that if we can make δ (or ϵ) small enough so that the motion of the particle remains bounded about the equilibrium point, then that point is stable. (The second method above that perturbs the energy is not exactly equivalent to the first that perturbs the initial position, with this definition of stable. This is because the second method then allows the point x = 0 to be a stable equilibrium of V(x) = (x2-1)4, for which all particle motion is bounded. The point x = 0 is unstable under the first method of perturbing the initial position, keeping initial velocity zero. The method of perturbing the initial position is the ""real"" method. Nevertheless, it helps to determine bounded motion by considering various energies, which is why I mention it.) Also note that stability in more than one dimension is more complicated, since we can have stability at a point in one direction, but instability in another. Such a point is typically called a saddle point, but it is sometimes useful to distinguish the directions of stability.  Back to our example. The points x = -1 and x = 1 are unstable because if we start the particle from rest at any point slightly away from either of these points, the particle never returns to the equilibrium. Indeed, the particle either exhibits bounded motion about the stable equilibrium or it runs off to minus or plus infinity. It is obviously true that if we leave the particle at x = 0 but give it enough energy (initial velocity), it will just fly away in whatever direction it was moving and never come back. That is not important in terms of classifying x = 0 as stable. All that matters is small perturbations.  Stability does not depend on the size of the perturbation per se. Stability is a property only of the potential itself. Now if we considered changing the parameter A, which describes the potential, then we can possibly get different stabilities, and that's where bifurcation comes in. Indeed, if A>0, the equilibrium points are x = -1,0,1 (unstable, stable, unstable). If A = 0, all points are metastable. If A<0, the equilibrium points are x = -1,0,1 (stable, unstable, stable). So the stability of the system abruptly changes when A = 0, and so is a bifurcation point.  A more dramatic example is the potential   V(x) = x3/3-ax   If a>0, then there are two equilibrium points, x = -sqrt(a) (unstable) and x = +sqrt(a) (stable). As the value of a decreases, the two equilibrium points get closer together, while retaining their respective stability. When a = 0, there is one equilibrium point at x = 0, which is unstable. If a<0, there are no equilibrium points at all. So the stability of this system has a bifurcation point at a = 0, which is of a much different and more dramatic flavor than the previous example.   Or am I missing some critical difference in the intuition? For me I see catastrophe theory as how small changes to a state in a stable equilibrium can create sudden shifts from one stable equilibrium to another. And in some systems it can be reversed like we are seeing here. Is that not what's going on?   Okay, back to the original question about the spinning object. What you are seeing in the various videos is not motion that swaps back and forth between two stability regions. If the tennis racket were spun exactly about its second principal axis, you would never see it tumble or perform half-twists. (edit: Actually, you would. But never mind that for now.) We can make an analogy with one-dimensional motion in the potential   V(x) = 2x2-5x4/4+x6/6   whose graph is here. If the particle were exactly on x = 1, it would never move. But if I perturb it ever so slightly (while keeping its initial velocity 0), it will move away from x = 1 and assume perioidic motion around either x = 0 (if you start it to the left) or x = 2 (if you start it to the right). If the particle goes to the left and moves about x = 0, it will never come back to x = 1 and switch over to the motion about x = 2. It simply stays in the potential well about x = 0.  A similar thing happens with the tennis racket, although the exact reasoning is not the same. If you spin it around an axis that just slightly differs from the second principal axis, it will instead rotate about an axis that in some coordinate system simply precesses about the first or third principal axis. Yes, the deviation from the first/third principal axis is large, but it will never suddenly go back to rotation about the second axis and then switch over to precession about the third/first axis. In short, there is no such thing as precession about the second principal axis. (The analogy to the one-dimensional motion is very loose, and only made to show that perturbations about an unstable equilibrium do not result in motions which switch between multiple motions which each are about a different stable equilibrium.)  Again, bifurcation theory concerns itself with how stability changes as a parameter not related to the initial conditions changes. That's because the initial conditions don't matter for stability, since we only consider small perturbations anyway."

It's a bit easier to explain why if we step away from electronics for a second and consider a mechanical CPU like a gravity-fed-water-CPU: at the top is a funnel to receive water; at the bottom the water will (eventually) come out; between the two is a series of water-and-gravity fed logic gates that store data, do arithmetic, and so on.  To do one 'cycle' of this CPU, you would pour an amount of water in the top. Gravity would pull it down through the logic gates, the state of the gates would change (water in some, no water in others), and the excess water falls out the bottom.  Let's simplify our computer to a single simple circuit, a toggling bit. Each cycle, it just inverts the gate... starts off empty, at the end of the first cycle it's full of water, end of the next cycle it's empty again, over and over. The 'full size' computer is just more of this kind of system.  Each time we pour water into our toggling bit, it changes state. Work is done to do that. When we're transitioning from 0 to 1, it retains water. When transitioning from 1 to 0, it's letting the water it previously retained flow. Just toggling backward and forward is pretty simple, and energetically not much different from just pouring the water from a height: changing the state of the bit takes work, but switching back and forth isn't much different from just the plain flow of water where all the 'work' done is used to heat the water.  It doesn't really matter what the gate circuit is, whether it does something useful like computation... the faster we run it, the more cycles we do, the faster the gates transition and the more warm water pours out the bottom. In the end, all we're doing is heating the water and the computation is just a side effect along the way. :)  Whilst electronic computers don't work like water-gravity-computers, the physics of what happens isn't much different. The network of transistors in the CPU requires work to be done in changing the state, but also some heat is generated whilst doing that... but we don't retain that state for long, we're always trying to do another cycle, the next step in the computation as soon as possible, and so we change the state back and forth, back and forth. By changing the state, as quickly as we can, the work done to change the state each cycle is effectively undone next cycle and becomes waste heat."

In the case of the bomb, it is of order microseconds.  I do not know how quickly the energy is released for a asteroid collision.    The damage and other physical effects are related to the power far more than the energy released.  That is why my 10 watt laser that outputs 1 joule pulses can cut through metal.  1 joule is not a whole lot of energy.  When that 1 joule happens in 10 nanoseconds, you have a whole lot of power (Megawatts)."

There is one key difference, however: a large impactor (km-scale) produces a temporary low-pressure ""channel"" through the atmosphere as it punches through to the surface.  Then the explosion occurs at the end of it when the impactor hits the surface.  From the papers I've read, this can produce an almost gun-like effect where material is shot back up the channel at suborbital and even potentially higher velocities.  The suborbital stuff then rains back down over the Earth.  This only happens with the large impacts, and there is significant variation in the effects depending on the angle of the impact.

askscience,3dur1q,sticklebat,2,Mon Jul 20 05:37:20 2015 UTC,"You really need to know both to draw any kind of conclusion at all. To take your example from a later post, 1 laser that deposits 1 J of energy in 10 nanoseconds is a 100 MW laser. Which is crazy powerful. But a 1 MW laser pointed at a piece of metal for 10 ns would only deposit 1 J of energy, which is not nearly enough to cut through it. You would have to keep the laser there for longer. Because, while power is relevant, so is the total energy.  I would not say that in this case power has more meaning. A nuclear explosion and an asteroid collision will both release energy in a very short timeframe. Specifically, both will occur on a timeframe much shorter than the duration of the effects of the phenomenon, which means the power output isn't really as useful a measure as the total energy output."
askscience,3dur1q,tauneutrino9,-4,Sun Jul 19 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"Power is completely relevant.  A nuclear weapons outputs the same energy as a nuclear power plant running for 1 day.  Same energy, different power.  Lets, take the 1 MW laser example.  A 1 MW laser outputting for 10 nanoseconds gives you 0.01 J.  Lets bump up the power to a 100 MW laser.  So a 100 MW laser hits the target for 10 ns, the power on target is still 100 MW.  That 1 J of energy still happens in 10 ns.  It would cut through.    There are many physical mechanisms that occur over the course of nanoseconds to microseconds that create different effects.  That is why 1 kt of TNT is not the same as 1 kt of nuclear energy in terms of damage."
askscience,3dur1q,sticklebat,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Power is completely relevant.   If you read my post, you would have seen this sentence:   You really need to know both to draw any kind of conclusion at all.   Power alone does not tell you what will happen. Total energy alone does not tell you what will happen. Both pieces of information are required to derive any useful conclusion. Never did I say that power is irrelevant.  Read more carefully.   There are many physical mechanisms that occur over the course of nanoseconds to microseconds that create different effects. That is why 1 kt of TNT is not the same as 1 kt of nuclear energy in terms of damage.   That has nothing to do with power vs. energy, and more to do with how the energy is released (for example, a much higher percentage of the energy in a nuclear detonation is released as electromagnetic radiation than in a TNT explosion - especially in the high energy spectrum), and how that in turn interacts with the environment. In that sense there will still be effective differences between a nuclear detonation and asteroid collision even assuming equal energy and power for both.  That said, again, since both phenomenon occur on very short time scales compared to their aftermaths, energy is at least as meaningful as power output here. We aren't talking about lasers incident for 10 ns vs. 1 s, here."

I will concede that energy gives you extra information. But that information has nothing to do with the physical effects that occur.    There is more to TNT versus nuclear  than the EM radiation.  The physical blast is different because of the different time scales.  That  is related to the power and not related to the fact that nuclear explosions would emit gamma rays and neutrons.    In the case of the asteroid, both information is useful.  However, comparing the effects of the two would require an understanding of the power far more than the energy.  Since the question is matching strength, I would take that as matching the damage potential."
askscience,3dur1q,sticklebat,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"Power is what matters in the laser case, not energy.   I'm really confused. You keep responding to my posts with irrelevant information. We aren't talking about lasers and I never disputed that. And even then, you are wrong: power is not the only thing that matters, nor does it solely determine the resulting physical effects. Duration of exposure is also relevant, and your 100 MW laser will have little effect on your piece of metal if it is actively for sufficiently small amounts of time. Physical effects of exposure to a laser will depend heavily on both power and duration.   There is more to TNT versus nuclear than the EM radiation.    Seriously, can you read? Do you not know what the words ""for example"" mean?  There are obviously a great many differences between nuclear explosions and conventional ones, but most of them are actually due two things: the enormously larger yields of nuclear detonations and the fact that only about 50% of the detonation's energy goes into the blast wave, with the remaining 50% being radiative (lumping both thermal and higher energy radiation together).  So yes, there would be differences between an asteroid and a nuclear bomb. And yes, those differences would be in part related to the power differences. But there is a reason why bombs are classified by yield and not by power; the detonations themselves, conventional or nuclear or asteroid, occur fast enough that the power is not as significant a determinant of destructiveness as is total yield."
askscience,3dur1q,tauneutrino9,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"I am making a point how power tells you far more information than energy in terms of physics.  The laser is just an easy example.    They are classified by yield since that is directly measured.  Power in that case only matters when comparing them to nonnuclear explosions.   occur fast enough that the power is not as significant a determinant of destructiveness as is total yield.   That is not true when the blasts are different and the energy transfer between the matter in the two situations are different. For example, nuclear is over in microseconds.  How long do you think it takes to convert the asteroids kinetic energy to heat? If it occurs over longer time, the resulting dissipation of energy would generate a different type of blast."
askscience,3dur1q,mikk0384,4,Sun Jul 19 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"It is true that it will be a different kind of blast, but in the context of mass extinction size asteroid impacts it won't matter wether if the energy is deposited in milliseconds or half a minute. The propagation time is orders of magnitude larger, and it is the total amount of energy that defines what consequences the impact will have. Whether the asteroid breaks up and evaporates in the atmosphere or makes an impact on the ground also has importance, since an asteroid that impacts the ground will cause much more debris to spread in the atmosphere, and as a result the sun will be blocked for longer, affecting life to a greater extent."
askscience,3dur1q,tauneutrino9,0,Mon Jul 20 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"So by propagation time you mean the time it takes for the energy to be dissipated, which is power.

That was my point, power has far more meaning than total energy."

And then you're saying that that other gene pool is, in some way, ""better"".  It's the idea against which you're comparing our current state.  Not to beat a dead horse, but there IS NO ""correct"" or ""better"" or ""ideal"" when it comes to evolution.  There is no ""should be"" or even ""natural"".  Evolution is driven by exactly one value: shit works or it doesn't.  It cannot anticipate the future, and it cannot plan for contingencies.  So I would say that the concept of ""harm"" itself is meaningless here.  You can also just as easily argue it the other way: The definition of ""fit"" depends entirely upon the environment.  We're changing our environment, and so we're changing what it means to be ""fit"".  Arguably, we're making it so that a larger percentage of humanity is ""fit"".  You could then argue that doing this means that we're able to retain a greater percentage of the variability present in the human gene pool.

Also, does anyone feel that medicine makes us live longer but we live a worse quality of life at that age and it makes me wonder why?

I believe these treatments are targeted to specific types of cancer, and are meant to be applied as a treatment rather than a preventative measure.  It should be noted that these gene therapies are typically somewhat localized, and don't change the genetic code in your entire body. Since the genes in one's sex cells are not altered, the changes from the therapy would not be passed down to their descendants.  I am not aware of any approved therapies that are intended to alter genes in utero or prior to conception, and while technically possible with current technology, I believe that this is currently viewed as unethical in the medical community.

I'm not en evolutionary biologist or geneticist, but I would say that modern medicine might not be ""hurting"" human evolution - but it's seriously influencing it I believe for good and for bad.   To give some examples, we benefit from modern medicine (as opposed to waiting on evolution) via vaccines because we don't have to wait as a species for resistance to develop randomly over time. We shouldn't ever have to worry about these illnesses again, so long as people continue to be vaccinated.   Where modern medicine might be ""harming"" our evolution is the advent of supplements or other 'dependable' medications. To be fair, this isn't so much medicine as it is health/wellness companies. But, a prolonged dependence (I mean over generations here...) on taking in nutrients from daily supplements will probably damage the fidelity of some of our genes involved in metabolism. (For example: if a significant amount of people are taking in almost all of their vitamin D through supplements, evolutionary biologists might start to see  changes our genes or expression levels of proteins involved in vitamin d synthesis). Same would go for narcotics, I'd imagine.   There are tons of other ways medicine might be effecting our genetics, but again, I'm speculating on a few here. I think the bottom line is that no one (to my knowledge at least) is really studying this. It seems like it would be a blossoming speciality, thought. If it's already not."
askscience,3dw7xm,michaelsmth129,18,Mon Jul 20 01:24:41 2015 UTC,"There are really a ton of examples of this. Humans have been a singular force in nature since they came about. Basically everywhere we go things have to adapt or be driven to extinction. And to the extent that extinction drives evolution we've been responsible for a lot of what you see around people.     Just as broad examples; we shape the evolution of our prey species by selectively killing specific phenotypes. There is some evidence of body size evolution in some fish because we tend to prefer the larger fish, so they're getting smaller. Pesticides and herbicides act as a selective force for basically anything they're designed to kill. Cities have changed dispersal mechanisms in plants that can no longer count on winds to do the job in the same way. There are a lot of examples like that.     But we also move things all over the world. We're basically continually adding new competitors to environments all the time and the existing species have to find a way to deal with that; also the introduced species will usually adapt to the new environment in some way. Then, as a way of dealing with the things we've introduced, we introduce their predators.     Also trophy hunting is likely driving the evolution of reduced secondary sexual characters. And another problem with over-fishing is a shift in the timing of life-history traits. I think it's Atlantic cod that have started reproducing at an earlier age because we wipe them out too fast.      A really interesting example that is anecdotal is a rattlesnake that may be losing its propensity to rattle. A South Dakota naturalist has reported that the rattlesnakes he encounters are far less likely to rattle in certain areas where people are more common. There is some genetic abnormality that weakens the tail and limits their ability to rattle. It used to be that a rattlesnake could rattle and whatever heard it would turn tail and run.

Those with paler colourations tended to survive, since they were harder for birds to spot. Every now and again a few would be born that had dark colourations, but these tended to be picked off very quickly and the mutation remained uncommon.  However, at a certain point humans built factories in the area which polluted the area with soot, blackening the trees. As a result, the lighter-coloured moths were suddenly very easy targets, while the darker-coloured moths' colouration gave them a better chance of survival. Within a couple of decades, the darker-coloured moths were significantly more numerous than the lighter-coloured ones, despite the darker ones being practically unknown before the pollution occurred."

Knowingly instigating selection of a trait or feature is the opposite of it happening naturally. That's not to say that natural selection won't produce the same result as the artificial selection given sufficient time, just that the artificial selection picks and chooses what to keep or change based on artificial, rather than natural, choices.  Artificial selection would be akin to killing off all cats, because we don't like them. That's not natural selection killing off cats, that's artificial selection.

You take a finch adapted for eating a particular seed and place it in a habitat where its primary seed is unavailable: the finches will alter through natural selection in a few generations to adapt to new available food sources.  This is a very poor and rudimentary example, but I feel is applicable since it illustrates it is entirely possible, and also nearly anyone who knows anything about evolution knows about Darwin and his finches. I also realize that you are looking for specific examples of evolution based on adapting to human behavior and not in an experimental fashion.  Some practical examples of species in nature evolving based on human behavior include Tawny Owls, Pink Salmon, Thyme, and Great Tits. The primary driving force between their evolution is global warming, which is altering behavior patterns and is putting genetic pressure on natural selection.  For example: Great Tits have a genetically coded time for laying eggs at the start of spring, however weather changes have altered the peak population period of their primary food source (caterpillars) which now occurs earlier than when the Great Tits eggs hatch. Bird numbers are dropping as a result of relative food scarcity. There is thus now genetic pressure to select for gene mutations that allow for earlier egg laying ability, or faster hatching time, in order to assure that offspring survive after hatching."

It basically says that ""sea mammals should have gills, because that makes sense!""  but totally ignores the huge advantage of breathing air: namely, oxygen is at much higher concentrations in air than water, which is the (hypothesized) reason that the biggest animals in water tend to breathe air.   [2]. The pseudo-penis of female hyenas is an adaptation that prevents forced copulation, which allows the females to choose partners that are fitter and not related to them, preventing incest.  [7]. Humans stomachs can't digest cellulose not because the bacteria needed for that are too ""busy helping termites,"" but because our digestive systems have evolved to digest a greater variety of foods.

One example of what this can be used to describe is snow hares that have huge feet that let them stand on the top of the snow. You can't say that snow hares evolved huge feet to stand on snow, because if their feet aren't quite big enough to let them, there's no advantage to it, and therefore won't be selected for. However, if having big feet helps them fight, then they'll evolve large feet which can eventually be used to stand on snow.

However, sexual selection is much less common, and, if you think about it for a moment, it should be obvious why: in order for the female hare to express a preference, she must have an evolved faculty to be able to discern a particular trait as advantageous. I.e., the female hare likes big feet because she evolved to like big feet. That is, natural selection had to come first: big feet were advantageous. Then it becomes advantageous to prefer big feet: sexual selection evolves. THEN sexual selection can feed back in on big feet, giving them a secondary advantage."

Now, there are of course ways for animals to become more desirable to their mates, and with hares, it might be big feet. But the issue there is that at a certain point, if the animal has few predators, that trait may stop being an advantage to survive, like with peacocks.   At one point, it was probably ""gotta mate with that bird with healthy feathers!"" Then it turned into ""that bird there has bigger feathers! Gotta mate with that one!"" Because peacocks have few predators, it's gotten to the ridiculous state that those birds are in today.   But the moment we change something in the peacock's habitat, say, introducing a predator, the game changes - big feathers are suddenly a disadvantage, and peacocks are easy prey.

Sexual selection is not essential to evolution, but in practice it does a lot of the heavy lifting.  It is still an open question, as others have noted, whether sexual selection is tightly keyed into natural fitness or is the tyranny of faddishness. Sir Mix-a-Lot liked big butts, which suggest both past success at food gathering and an easier pregancy to come, but his anaconda is comically disproportionate to its function and does not serve much of a signalling role (other than to call itself to a potential mate's attention--it signals nothing about Sir Mix-a-Lot's fitness beyond the likelihood of his son's conformity to a particular fashion).

For example, that link says a whale can't breathe underwater and that it's a ""bad design"" - what if in the future, when something unexpected happens to oceans, whales will have an evolutionary advantage thanks to this trait? I believe dinosaurs didn't evolve feathers to be able to fly, so when dinosaurs had feathers but couldn't yet fly, we would have said feathers are ""useless"" but who's laughing now? Anything that seems pointless now may just be a vital thing in waiting.   I don't think ""dumb or stupid"" evolutionary trait is the proper term of art, but I also think biologists who use the term just use it to refer to a trait that has no apparent advantage and so no reason to expect evolution to have produced in the first place. Evolution cannot select for a trait that is advantageous only in the future, but it also doesn't necessarily ""erase"" or ""select away"" traits that were once advantageous but no longer are.   A possible future advantage to aquatic mammals breathing air instead of water would never be selected for, but they evolved from land-living ancestors common to today's land living mammals (Anacalagon also points out that air breathing isn't even necessarily a disadvantage, but that's a whole other point). Similarly, I'm pretty sure that the favored hypothesis for feathers on flightless dinosaurs was for warmth (the fact that dinosaurs were even warm-blooded is a newish revelation...all my childhood dinosaur books asserted they were cool-blooded ancestors of modern reptiles.)

Many of the inhabitants for generations have developed specific antigens that defend against malaria, all thanks to the strong, curving path evolution follows: this case the environment.

For really dense things like surfaces that would generally emit as a black body, reflectance spectroscopy is generally a better bet. In other words, you observe the sunlight reflecting off an asteroid, subtract a solar spectrum, and you're left with an absorption spectrum that's pretty indicative of the general type of asteroid.  With all that said, the ""platinum"" asteroid headlines you've been reading are a bunch of hype. We know it's part of the X-group of asteroids, and most probably an M-type. This group is believed to consist of asteroids rich in metals, presumably originating as a differentiated metallic core of a proto-planet before breaking apart.  Exactly which kinds of metals, though, isn't known. Our spectra just aren't good enough to make that kind of determination. It's quite possible it's just iron-nickel...so why is the platinum thing getting so much press?   Well, the group claiming it's made of platinum isn't a group of NASA scientists, but rather ""Planetary Resources"", a start-up asteroid mining company burning through seed/grant money. It's no coincidence that on Thursday they just launched their first test platform for their future prospecting telescopes into low-Earth orbit. Little wonder they'd choose now to build up hype about lucrative precious metals whizzing past us.  TL;DR: It's probably a metallic asteroid. The ""platinum"" bit is pure speculation, the result of a nascent asteroid mining start-up company trying to build hype around itself."
askscience,3dtanv,Astromike23,40,Sun Jul 19 10:51:02 2015 UTC,"It's not speculation at all.  It is a very robust scientific theory.  Nickel Iron meteorites have been studied by the thousands in extreme detail and they are not all unique from each other.  In fact, they tend to all fall well within the 13 groups in which we classify them (by composition and morphology).  Some argue we need closer to 50 groups, but there are very distinct features that are seen in nickel/iron meteorites that clump them together with each other.    It is theorized they are so starkly differentiated into groups in this way because each parent body was a different size, had different heat sources (closer to the sun, more elliptical orbit, greater concentrations of short lived naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, etc), and had different cooling rates.  There is an extremely large sum of evidence to point towards the fact that during the formation of the solar system, there were 13-50 failed planetoids that were large enough, while molten, to cause differentiation like the Earth where the 'heavy' metallic contents sank to the core, leaving the light silicates on the surface.  The vast majority of these (all except perhaps Ceres) have now been pulverized.    M-type asteroids are shards of the metallic cores of these failed planetoids.  They are >99% metal content and contain extremely high (relative) concentrations of platinum group metals.  This is all extremely well supported science based on the observation of nickle-iron meteorites.  We have essentially confirmed this to be the case with density measurements of high albedo asteroids thought to be metallic, and discovering densities that coincide with 99% nickel/iron compositions (with a few notable exceptions).  Not all of the nickel/iron groups are created equal when it comes to platinum concentrations.  Some only contain 1ppm, while others contain >30ppm.  So scouting potential mining sites is critical.  If we were to find a single, tiny little 250 meter M-type in the later group, it would contain ~5,250 metric tonnes of platinum.  At 32 dollars a gram, that is 168 billion dollars at today's spot price."

Sure, but making a definitive claim of $5.4 trillion worth of platinum would require a concentration of roughly 1000 ppm, and is just completely unrealistic.  Even your estimate of 30 ppm is still very optimistic. It's believed that ~75% of Type IIIAB iron meteorites have platinum group metal (PGM) concentrations less than 30 ppm, with a median value of just 6.8 ppm (Table I, Elvis, 2013, ""How  Many Ore-­Bearing Asteroids"", PDF here).  That's not to say there aren't some near-Earth asteroids with high PGM concentrations - statistically, there should be a few.

I mean...  a glass of water stores whether or not it's more than half full in binary.  An observer can determine it fairly easily.  A river stores the data on whether or not it's flowing...  By data you presumably mean ""arbitrary data"", but then I'd argue that a series of glasses of water will do the same job.  If you disallow storage media where human eyes can do the reading, then you'd have to disallow a lot of printed output, books, punch cards etc.  If you allow disallow storage media where there exists evidence of mechanical devices performing some data transformation, then I can come up with some arbitrary measurement devices and contraptions that read anything from water levels to temperature to pressure.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom for example.  It weaves patterns using punch-cards that determine when and where needle points need to be.  Would that count?"
askscience,3du6ag,shinzura,56,Sun Jul 19 14:37:39 2015 UTC,"One of the main mechanisms of heat transfer is through the emission of thermal radiation. All macroscopic objects above 0K will emit electromagnetic radiation simply by virtue of being at a non-zero temperature. The spectral profile of such this radiation is that of a so-called black-body and depends on the temperature as shown here. For the sun, which acts as an effective black-body at 5800K, the thermal radiation peaks in the visible range, which is why it produces so much visible light. The Earth on the other hand, acts as a black-body with an effective temperature of about 250K, and so most of its radiation occurs well into the infrared as shown here. As a side-note, the difference in the two spectral profiles is critical to understanding the greenhouse effect. While most sunlight can pass through the atmosphere, a large fraction of the thermal radiation from the Earth is reflected back by gases in the atmosphere (such as CO2), as shown here, resulting in far higher surface temperatures than would exist in the absence of an atmosphere.   Exactly the same would happen to your ball of iron. Whether it is in space or on Earth, it would be continuously emitting thermal radiation and cooling in the process, until it reached an equilibrium temperature."

The spectrum is described by a density distribution obviously the planck function does not give you the amount of power being emitted at each wavelength. You have to integrate over an interval to find the power from all the wavelengths in that interval. How you choose your intervals changes the peaks of the distribution function.

askscience,3dudve,-j-b-c-,22,Sun Jul 19 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"okay, might actually have some insight to offer to this sub!  Economics actually does pretty well with certain prediction. And even though we get a bad name, our assumptions normally work in a large scale. However, I'm guessing that the question is more like why don't we know what's going to happen tomorrow.  There are various reasons for this. Mostly it has to do with the stochastic nature of choices and events,  and the way that predictions change the outcome.  The randomness of choice and incomplete information aspect make most economics predictions kind of like statistical ones. It isn't that something is going to happen for sure but rather that it has a good chance of happening or not. And so if a big event or an unlikely one, like a earthquake or introduction of a revolutionary technology, it changes the odds.  In physics, we can say something and no matter the prediction, it happens. However, if i say that the price of gold is going to fall by 10 percent because the sun is shinning more today and enough people believe me, it will happen (and this doesn't violate any assumption of rationality) .  So the prediction (right or wrong) will affect what happens.   Finally, to your question about optimal outcome, the answer is actually a big disagreement in the economics community. Some believe that markets  at any point are always in equilibrium (  The Chicago school of thought); but there is also a big side that says that markets do fail. I personally tend to side with the answer that it isn't, but I study micro not macro so I'm not completely caught up in the literature."

Like you said now it's more of a dynamic equilibrium approach but for example Rbc still believes that in the long run everything is in equilibrium and that the current situation are just shocks with no ""real"" consequences. I know that Robert Lucas (ucla) had a blog post a year or so ago defending the equilibrium assumption, and saying something along the lines that equilibrium doesn't equal optimal allocation.

askscience,3dudve,hugspanda,10,Mon Jul 20 20:06:08 2015 UTC,"Economics makes some pretty strong assumptions about the choices of economic actors.  Stuff like they want to maximize utility and utility can easily be measured as the amount of money they get.  However, it is rare that economic motivations are that simple.  The ability to accurately predict the decisions of every individual is difficult when the true measure of utility for those individuals is only an approximation.  I might not care as much about money and will be more concerned about a social pay-off of some sort.    Also there are a lot of assumptions about the amount of knowledge that these agents have and how efficiently they incorporate that knowledge into their decision making process.  I might be wrong, but I think that the assumptions for the most part are that individuals are perfectly rational, fully informed on all publicly available information and perfectly incorporate that information into their decision making.  When billions of dollars are on the line, I might be close to this, but when I am deciding on how to spend $10 I tend to take short cuts to make a more efficient decision.  All of this isn't to say that economics doesn't have any predictive power, just that some of the predictive power is lost due to the fundamental assumptions that are made in order to build a lot of the models that exist in economics.   edit: As a response to your second question, the current economy does not reflect the optimal application of the science of economics.

Neither of those is about money, but by observing your choices you tell us something about your values and which brings you more utility.  The OPs question has a fairly broken premise. Economics IS very predictive.  Why isn't it perfectly predictive? Well Economics is a social science, not a hard science. So while we have lots of formulas, models, math, equations and numbers to put into them, they do not tell the whole story. We can't just set up two identical economies except for one variable and watch how both go to learn something. Much like with History, we only get to see how things actually went, we don't have the luxury of knowing both sides of a given choice. This leads it to some interpretation.  Many things in economics are also swamped by the complexity of the world. Other sciences have this issue too, but not nearly as bad. Think of the comically false ""frictionless environment"" in mechanical engineering or physics, but the simpler calculations assuming that are still useful. In economics there are MANY MANY other variables that are nearly impossible to model.  For example, politics, psychology, sociology, even the decisions of a single important person can be significant enough to basically throw the results of your model into the garbage.

It is, however, ""that which is (or is meant to be) optimized by a decision-making process,"" whatever that may be. (Aside: I'd like to also point out that a morality is basically any process that assigns 'value' to possible states of reality.)  So it is more like the concept of energy in physics: a useful abstraction, but no something that we know how to usefully break down into 'units' of other concepts that are themselves useful.  Unfortunately, this leaves a bit of a prescriptive/proscriptive divide: is utility that which is measured to have been optimized by a decision, or is it that which was meant to be optimized? Can utility actually be measured? Can it be in error, or is it always our model of it that is in error?  It's really hard to think accurately about relationships in terms of utility as other things.

We now allow for micro foundations that take into account different preferences) we don't account for mother teresa that gives everything up and goes serve the ones in need. However, when you think about it, there aren't many of those. So we can normally ignore that and still get excellent results, and predictions. And we as a whole do act pretty rational, even with a $10 decision.   Full information actually hasn't been assumed in a long time (what i actually study is basically the cool things that happen when you don't have full information in different scenarios. ) and noise is normally calculated in most models so we don't even assume that you use that information correctly.   Finally, money is just an easy way to keep score, and how you spend your money reveals your preference most of the time. So its actually backwards most of the time, its how are you going to spend your money in order to maximize your utility (utility is never believed to be equal to the amount of money you get).   tl;dr while there are many things to criticize economics about, most of your concerns have been address and fixed in the last 30 years."

What causes surface tension?  The answer is ""hydrogen bonds"".  Water has one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, forming a V-shaped molecule.  You probably heard about covalent interactions, where two share electrons.  But covalent interactions don't always result in equal sharing (in fact they usually don't).    In the case of water, oxygen pulls on the electrons much more strongly than hydrogen does, causing the electrons to be around the oxygen atom much more often than the hydrogen atoms.  This gives the oxygen atom a slight negative charge on average, and the hydrogen atoms a slight positive charge on average.    This difference in charge causes the negative, oxygen side of one water molecule to be strongly attracted to the positive, hydrogen side of another.  Because this attraction is much stronger than the attraction to molecules in the air, a droplet of water is at its lowest-energy state when as many water molecules are in contact with other water molecules as possible, which means it has the smallest possible surface area.  That is what causes surface tension, water ""trying"" to minimize its surface area.  In the case of two droplets, one bigger droplet has smaller surface area than two smaller droplets, so the two droplets combine.   This results in an overall decrease in the energy (and increase in entropy) of the entire system.  Another factor that is commonly ignored is entropy.  Because of its configuration, water molecules in liquid water have an extremely large number of possible orientations.  This means that water has an extremely large amount of entropy compared to many other similarly-sized molecules when in liquid state.  Water molecules having other water molecules as neighbors results in much more entropy than water molecules having air as its neighbor.  So the entropy also leads to a minimization in surface area.  In fact, the entropy is more important for water's surface tension than the electrostatic interactions I mentioned previously."

askscience,3dy50i,skratchx,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Two water droplets become one water droplet when their edges touch due to surface tension. Water droplets want to minimize their surface energy and they can do this in several ways depending on the local geometry. Assuming the droplet is on a flat surface, the main two things that matter are the angle between the hard surface and the water (called the ""wetting angle"") and the curvature of the interface between the droplet and the air around it.    The moment that the edges of two water droplets touch, the curvature at the point where they touch is very large. The curvature is minimized by forming one hemispherical (modulo deformation due to gravity) surface. This phenomenon is called coalescence.    I'm not an expert on these things but you can also collide two water droplets and have them bounce off of each other instead of coalescing. I don't know all of the science behind why they sometimes bounce or sometimes coalesce."

The total volume is  [; V = \frac{4\pi}{3} R^3 + \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3 = \frac{8\pi}{3}R^3;]  After an eventual merge, they will become a single droplet of radius [;R';] and equal volume, since water is incompressible:  [; V = \frac{4\pi}{3} R'^3 \Rightarrow R' = 2^{1/3} R ;]  The energy that drives the merge is surface tension. The energy associated with the water-air interface is proportional to the area:  [; E = \tau A;]  where [;\tau;] is the surface tension (units of energy over area). Then the energy before was:  [; E_i = 2 \left( \tau 4\pi R^2 \right) ;]  and after  [; E_f = \tau 4 \pi R'^2 = \tau 2^{2/3} 4 \pi R^2 < E_i ;]  The final energy is less than the initial energy and so the process spontaneously happens."

If you are not compressing the air, then the jars are not identical. If the air-jar is a heavier, denser jar of the same size, designed to weight the same as the honey jar, they will act the same (total average density is equal)  If you simply have a larger jar of air to match the weight of air to the weight of honey, then the bigger jar is lessdense and displaces more water for the same amount of mass, thus will continue to float.

The reason is that the densities of the fluid and object might be different. So, in your example, since air less dense than water, that jar will rise (assuming the jar itself is not so dense as to make it want to sink. The jar of honey will sink since honey is more dense than water. All that matters are the relative densities, not the weights.*  Mathematically, this is what is going on. Suppose the object is fully submerged and not moving. (Of course, if the object is less or more dense than water, it would sink or swim, but we can imagine that you are pushing it up or down to keep it from sinking or floating.) There are three forces on the object: its weight, the buoyant force, and your push, either up or down. The net force is 0. So we have   0 = Fweight+Fbuoyant+Fpush   Weight points down, buoyant points up, and the push points either up or down. So we have   0 = -ρobjectVg+ρfluidVg+Fpush   (Here V is the total volume of the object.) Rearranging, we get the following:   Fpush = (ρobject-ρfluid)Vg   The quantity on the right hand side can be positive or negative. (Note that Vg is always positive.) For air, the right hand side is negative, since the air is less dense. So this means your push is also negative, i.e., pointing downward. That makes sense. The air wants to float. So you have to push it down to keep it from doing that. For honey, the right hand side is positive, since honey is more dense than water. So your push force is positive, pointing upward. You have to push up on it to keep it from sinking."

There is probably some confusion about what you, I, and the OP mean when we say ""the jars weigh the same"". Do we mean jar+contents or just the jar? The OP's statement that ""they both weight the same"" is ambiguous. Is the antecedent of ""they"" the jars only or jars+contents? Clearly, if he meant to say that the jar+contents weigh the same for both cases, then the jars themselves cannot be identical. So let's be extra careful about what we mean.  I was imagining two identical jars, one filled with honey and the other empty (i.e., filled with air). These two objects (jar+contents) obviously have different weights. It is true that the empty one rises because air is less dense than water, but that fact is obscured by the different weights. Since the jars have the same volume, the jar with the contents that have a smaller density must also necessarily be the object that weighs less.  So forget about jars. Just consider two masses: one of air and one of honey. If you prefer, you can imagine these two masses are contained in a very thin balloon which has negligible mass and density. Suppose the air and the honey have the same mass. Obviously this means that their volumes are different. The math in my original post does not change:   Fpush = (ρobject-ρfluid)Vobjectg   The sign of the push force is determined only by the sign of (ρobject-ρfluid) since the volume is positive. Since air is less dense than water, it rises. Since honey is more dense than water, it sinks."

The answer is no.  Two jars of the same volume and weight will behave exactly the same.   So forget about jars. Just consider two masses: one of air and one of honey. If you prefer, you can imagine these two masses are contained in a very thin balloon which has negligible mass and density. Suppose the air and the honey have the same mass.   It does not obviously mean their volumes are different.

askscience,3dvrzh,davethepretty,0,Mon Jul 20 11:58:54 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, the water doesn't know what's inside the can. So the buoyancy force can't have anything to do with what's inside. It ONLY has to do with the properties of water, and the key property is that pressure increases with depth. This means something pretty simple: Pressure on the sides of the can will obviously cancel, but pressure on the bottom of the can will exceed the pressure on the top of the can. So if you have two cans of identical dimensions, and you submerge them, the buoyancy force on them will be identical regardless of can contents.  But now the question is, why does one float and the other one sinks? That's because there are TWO forces acting on each can. There is the weight of the contents and the buoyancy force upward. So if you have a can of Campbell's Cream of Styrofoam Soup and a can of Campbell's Cream of Gold Nuggets Soup (identical can shapes), then the latter will sink because it weighs more.  Now, in your case, where you've arranged the cans to weigh the same, they obviously cannot have the same can shape and volume. The can of air has to be waaay bigger than the can of honey in order to weigh the same. And so the pressure differential on the can of air will be more and so will the buoyancy force."

askscience,3dvspe,XS121,5,Sun Jul 19 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"Causality is important because of predictability. ""Typical"" (hyperbolic) partial differential equations describing physical phenomena have good existence and uniqueness on causally sane regions of spacetime. Given initial conditions on a certain slice ""at constant time"", there exists a solution extending to the whole region, past and future, and it's unique. Or, even better, taking a finite-precision measurement at an event x it's possible to predict a statistical correlation with an eventual (past or future) measurement at another event y. Physics is just about predicting those correlations and nothing more.  Instead, when such equations are formulated in a spacetime with a bad causality structure (e.g. one with CTCs) then very often the equation does not have solutions or has multiple (generally infinite) solution and there is no way to predict which one will be chosen. Given initial conditions it's almost always not possible to solve them on the region. It's impossible, given a measurement result, to predict the statistical correlation with another measurement. Everything becomes unpredictable and physics dies.  Violations of causality also kill thermodynamics and computation (and so humans), so noncausal regions are pretty much hostile to any known physical structure or phenomena anyway. But the impossibility of doing physics is pretty much it."
askscience,3dvspe,rantonels,7,Mon Jul 20 06:40:38 2015 UTC,"So, first of all, what does causality mean in physics? An event has spatial and temporal coordinates (t,x,y,z) in spacetime. In SR, we know that different inertial observers will disagree on the temporal or spatial distances between two events, because of effects like time dilation and length contraction. However, the quantity ds2 = c2dt2-dx2-dy2-dz2 is agreed upon by all observers, where the ""d"" refers to the difference in that quantity between two events.  Now fix some inertial observer. Suppose for two events A and B, the interval between them satisfies ds2 > 0. What does that mean physically? Let's just stick to one dimension to make it a bit easier. It means that c2dt2-dx2>0, or cdt>dx. That is, the spatial distance between the two events is shorter than the distance light would have traveled in the time between the two events. We then say that A is causally connected to B. (In particular, if the time coordinate of A is smaller than that of B, then it is possible for A to have caused B.)  Remember that not all inertial observers will agree on the exact coordinates of A and B. That is, you might say dt = 3, and I might say that dt = 1. But everyone agrees on the value of ds2. And if ds2>0, everyone will also agree on the sign of dt. That is, if ds2>0 (so the two events can be connected by a light ray), then everyone will agree that A occurred before B. They will disagree on exactly how much before, but everyone will say A was before B. This is what we mean when we say that SR preserves causality. (In classical physics, causality is trivially preserved because time is absolute. Everyone agrees on all temporal distances between events.)  Note that if ds2<0, then cdt<dx, so that the two events could not have been connected by a light ray. The two events are not causally connected. Indeed, in that case, some observers would say A occurred before B and other observers would say B occurred before A.  So what ultimately ensures that causality is preserved in SR? Simple: inertial observers cannot travel relative to each other faster than light."
askscience,3dvspe,Midtek,3,Sun Jul 19 23:55:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your explanation!   I only have a very basic understanding of Minkowski space and special relativity, so I apologize if this question is frivolous, but isn't that circular logic? Or is there another reason that inertial observers cannot travel relative to each other fast than the speed of light?"
askscience,3dvspe,Midtek,7,Mon Jul 20 00:03:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you mean. There is one very crucial part I left out: the constancy of the speed of light. All inertial observers observe light to move at speed c. So if you are moving at 0.9999c with respect to me and emit a photon, I will see that photon move at c with respect to me, and you will also see that photon move at c with respect to you. But let's go back a bit to answer your question from first principles.  SR can be derived from two axioms:  (1) The laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames.  (2) Light signals in a vacuum are propagated rectilinearly, with the same speed c in all directions, at all times, in all inertial frames.  (Technically speaking, axiom (2) does not have to refer to light, but I will return to that point since it is offers a slightly different way of looking at the preservation of causality philosophically.) Axiom (2) can be experimentally verified as it is stated. These two axioms then lead to the Lorentz transformations. The exact derivation is a bit involved. It's not difficult, but just a bit tedious. You first show that the transformation between two inertial observers must be linear. Then you can consider two frames in so-called standard configuration to simplify matters, with any two frames not in standard configuration able to be put in such a configuration by spatial rotations and temporal translations. You eventually get down to   x' = γ(x-vt)  x = γ(x'+vt')   An appeal to axiom (2) then finishes the job since both x'=ct' and x=ct must be valid simultaneously, being the description of the same light signal in two different inertial frames. So you get the usual formula for the Lorentz factor γ, and the rest follows: time dilation, length contraction, invariance of ds2, etc.  Now how does causality fit into all of this logically? The Lorentz transformation shows that γ becomes infinite if v=c and γ is imaginary if v>c. This does not mean that no particle can travel at or faster than c, just that no two inertial frames can travel at or faster than c relative to each other. However, if now insist that causality not be violated by these transformations (in the sense that I defined in my original post), then we can show that the speed of all particles, even all signals, cannot be greater than c.  The argument is rather simple. Consider a signal sent from event to A to event B at some speed u>c relative to some inertial frame S. We can choose the coordinates so that the events both occur on the x-axis. Suppose the temporal and spatial separations are dt and dx. Then in the frame S', which moves at speed v relative to S, we have   dt' = γ(dt-vdx/c2) = γdt(1-uv/c2)   But since u>c, we find that c2/u < c. So there exists v such that c2/u<v<c, which implies that   1-uv/c2 < 0   So if dt>0, then dt'<0. That is, if we allow signals to travel faster than light, then given any two events A and B, there will *always* be an inertial frame which reverses the temporal order of the events. That is, (superluminal speeds) ==> (violation of causality). Note that in my original post I explained that (speed limit of light speed c)==>(preservation of causality). So it turns out that non-violation of causality and the speed of light being constant across inertial frames are equivalent statements.  We can go back to something I originally wrote above about the second axiom: that it's not important that it refers to light. There are two possibilities: either signals and particles can propagate at arbitrarily high speeds or they cannot. Let us also assume non-violation of causality. If arbitrarily high speeds are allowed, then we find that the only consistent transformation between inertial frames is Galilean. If there is some least upper bound c for speeds, then we can show that the speed c, whether it is achieved by any actual particle or signal, must transform into itself when switching frames. That is, this speed c must have the same property of the speed of light in axiom (2), that it is the same for all inertial observers. We can then derive the Lorentz transformation as usual. Non-violation of causality in this context is then equivalent to c being the least upper bound for speeds.  So, on the one hand, axiom (1) + (non-violation of causality) ==> all inertial frames are related either by Galiliean or Lorentz transformations. On the other hand, we also have the implication (exists a least upper bound speed c) <==> (the speed c transforms into itself when switching inertial frames). So no reference to light needs to made to derive SR. The role of axiom (2) is then twofold: there actually is a least upper bound c, and it turns out that it is achieved, namely by light."
askscience,3dvspe,ChipotleMayoFusion,4,Mon Jul 20 00:50:19 2015 UTC,"I think the real question here is: what evidence do we have that the axioms of SR are correct? I kinda agree with OP, it seems a bit circular. I do see the logic in arguing based on various paradoxes, but i dont know if there is a rigerous version of the argument that excludes all versions of time travel."
askscience,3dvspe,karantza,4,Mon Jul 20 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"The axioms of SR may well not be correct, or they might be incomplete, it's just that all our evidence so far says they are. And we have a lot of evidence. But this is why things like that paper where neutrinos were thought to travel faster than light are such a big deal - if we could find evidence that relativity is wrong, that would be super important, and we'd keep our theoretical physicists employed for decades to come.  You could hypothetically talk about a universe where causality violations are allowed, but then you get some interesting paradoxes. If you allow A to cause B, and B to cause A, do both A and B happen, or neither? Until we can demonstrate some kind of causality violation in reality, it's probably safe to assume that such things don't really work. If you want to be a philosopher though, go ahead and take a crack at it."
askscience,3dvspe,Midtek,4,Mon Jul 20 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"So my response post above is a bit long, but these are the important implications.   axiom (1) + (non-violation of causality) ==> (all inertial frames are related either by Galiliean or Lorentz transformations)  (exists a least upper bound speed c) ==> (the speed c transforms into itself when switching inertial frames)  (exists speed c that transforms into itself when switching inertial frames) + (non-violation of causality) ==> (c is the least upper bound speed)   If there is no least upper bound speed, we can also just say c = infinity, since an infinite speed must also obviously transform into itself. So the real power of the second and third statements is that they hold for finite values of c also. The determination of Galilean versus Lorentz transformation is only a matter of whether c is infinite (Galilean) or c is finite (Lorentz). The role of axiom (2) is then simply to state that c is finite. It fulfills that role by stating that the speed of light in a vacuum is invariant across inertial frames. With non-violation of causality, the third implication above states that the speed of light must therefore be the (finite) least upper bound speed required by a Lorentz transformation.  So the questions that remain are:  (A) What is the evidence that axiom (1) holds?  (B) What is the evidence that axiom (2) holds?  (C) What is the reasoning for demanding non-violation of causality?  I will answer these as best I can, in reverse order.  I see now why my original response to the OP seems circular. I require non-violation of causality to deduce SR, but then use SR to deduce causality. That's not really what I was doing, and this is why. I originally interpreted the OP's question more as ""how does a physical theory, for example SR, maintain causality?"" since that really is the only meaningful question to ask about causality in this context. (In other words, I thought OP was asking how causality is defined within SR and how it manifests itself in its laws and mathematical deductions.) Non-violation of causality cannot be deduced from the two SR axioms. You can think of it as a third axiom if you want, although it seems to be something so basic of science and philosophy that I would not categorize it as an SR axiom. Indeed, if causality violations were allowed, the classical paradoxes of killing your grandfather or being responsible for your own birth immediately arise. You also get paradoxes like being able to fire a gun and have it arrive at its destination before it was fired (this is similar in construction to giving birth to yourself). We also would not be able to make predictions since we could never say for sure whether event A is causally connected to event B.  As for question (B), there are certainly experiments that directly show the constancy of c. The Michelson-Morley experiment, for example, in addition to showing the absence of any luminiferous ether, also shows the constancy of the speed of light (to experimental error). But, of course, verification that c is constant can be done by more than just measuring it directly. The speed of light turns up in many physical laws, and so verification of those laws indirectly show that constancy of c is consistent. If there were something wrong with axiom (2), then there would have to be something seriously wrong with the rest of SR. For instance, the predictions made by SR on the kinematics of collisions of particles at high speed are used all the time and are shown to be accurate.   As for question (A), I sort of default to the same reasoning as for question (B). It is consistent with observation. The only difference is really that axiom (1) in a way just defines what an inertial frame is, so you can't perform an experiment to verify the truth of the axiom. It must be true. It's a definition. But we can verify whether defining such an object is consistent with the rest of physics."

I mean,  I get that delta-T as we perceive it is likely just an artifact of our perception,  but it seems like the idea of causality itself is reliant on a delta-T of some kind (forward or reverse)  to even be a thing....

If you ""measure"" a photon in a way that doesn't get entangled with a classical environment, and then destroy the supposedly-recorded-information-that-was-never-actually-available, your later destruction of the information appears to change what happened at the slits. This requires assuming that some definite choice was made at the slits that your measurement objectively detected. An actual quantum treatment of the whole problem contains nothing like that.

askscience,3du7um,victorinox126,59,Sun Jul 19 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"If the atmosphere remained constant, then the only change you would see when pushing the Earth further away from the sun would be that everything would look darker, but the actual color (i.e. spectral color) of the sky would not change. The reason is that the color of the sky is only determined by two things: 1) the spectral profile of the sun and 2) the nature of the scattering centers (i.e. atoms, molecules, or particulates) that direct this light towards you. First of all, think about why you even see anything at all when you look at a spot in the sky far away from where the sun is. The sun's rays are pretty much parallel, so naively you would expect that you would see bright white light when looking directly at the sun and complete darkness (or starlight and such) when looking elsewhere. In fact, this is exactly what it looks like on the moon or other celestial bodies that lack an atmosphere.  On Earth, on the other hand, part of the incident sunlight is scattered by the atoms and particulates in the atmosphere as shown here. On a clear day (and in the absence of pollution), most of the scattering is mediated by small atoms, which have a size far smaller than the wavelength of the incoming light. In this regime, the scattering you get is so-called  Rayleigh scattering, which has the important property that its intensity scales as (1/l)4, where l is the wavelength of the light. This means that the shorter components of sunlight (i.e. the blue components) are scattered more efficiently than the red components. This is why the sky looks blue on a clear day.   On the other hand, on a cloudy day things would be different. The reason is that in contrast to atoms, the water droplets making up the clouds are on the same lengthscale as the wavelength of visible light. In this regime, the dominant scattering mechanism is so-called Mie scattering. Mie scattering has no strong wavelength dependence, so blue and red light are scattered about equally. This why clouds looks white, they simply scatter light that has the same spectral profile as the incoming sunlight, i.e. white! As a sidenote, Mie scattering is also the reason why paper looks white.  To sum it all up, the effective color of the sky only depends on the spectral profile of sunlight (or whatever the dominant source of illumination is), and the nature of the scattering centers that redirect this light downwards. Neglecting the changes to the atmosphere that would be caused by pushing the Earth further away from the sun, the color of the sky would not appreciable change. The only major effect would be that the total intensity of the sunlight would be far dimmer, so everything would just look darker."

You can find a graph of boiling point vs pressure here and this article talks about the vacuums that can be created in syringes.  According to that article they were able to get a vacuum of -441 torr from a 10 mL syringe, which means you could start boiling water that was at about 80 C.  That is certainly way hotter than a normal residential water heater which generally is around 50 C but depending on where you were pulling the water from it could be done.  Now, if the water wasn't hot and the syringe wasn't particularly great then there is little chance you were boiling the water.  More likely you were pulling in small amounts of air through the needle or it was leaking through the needle/syringe seal and causing bubbles to come up through the liquid already in the syringe."

I've done it before and its very likely due to the fact that the teeny tiny air bubbles (or dissolved gases) in the water can expand to fill up the larger space whereas the water itself is much much more resistant to changing its volume.

One of the central theories of life is that life is able to reproduce so it makes sense that any slight change in the central dogma could bring on unfavorable results to a species, (cant build/reproduce the cell).  Most bacteria and I believe archaea all go through a process called binary fission to replicate, and Animals go through meosis/mitosis.  All of life uses A T G C and U as nucleotides and has the same 20 Amino Acids, although I believe there are 1 or 2 known species witch break the rule witch is actually a common thing in bio.  In fact, Ribosomal RNA (machinery that builds proteins) is one of the best ways to compare how related microbial species are to one another.  However, you're question is interesting because when you ask about enzymes you're thinking of the actual protein amino acid sequences that could slightly change.  Silent mutations could cause the DNA sequence to change, however the Amino Acid sequence of the protein wouldn't change.  There are other mutations that could happen, however their affect can be debated but the overall idea is the more related to replication/development the DNA sequence is the more conserved it will be and the more detrimental it will be for the organism if mutations occur."

We have much more extensive machinery for regulation, modification, and repair than bacteria do."
askscience,3duaay,Arcola56,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the most crucial components of the physical embodiment of the genetic code (a nucleotide triplet coding for a particular amino acid) is the set of enzymes that do the molecular ""loading"" of each amino acid (AA) onto the appropriate transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule.  These are the Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) enzymes.  Evolutionarily. the aaRSs are highly functionally conserved, and show evidence of several families having evolved prior to the time of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), with some aaRSs for related AAs having diverged from an even more ancient common ancestor.  Horizontal transfer of families of aaRSs genes from the early Archaea to the Bacteria are also in evidence, and somewhat less transfer in reverse, though the aaRS differences between those groups are today strong .  This suggests that in the earliest stages of cellular life, exchange of genetic material was less restricted, and evolution was a communal process."
askscience,3duaay,Scientismist,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well, today's my lucky day...I can actually answer a question that's about the subject of my thesis!  tl;dr: The fundamental mechanisms dealing with nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) are highly conserved across all domains of life.  There's potentially a lot of material you could be asking about here, but let's break it down a bit. In your question there are two largish categories you're asking about: enzymes that synthesis/catabolize nucleic acids, and enzymes/proteins that manage medium-to-large scale structure of nucleic acid polymers.  The second category includes your gyrases, helicases, processivity clamps, histones, and related helpers. These proteins are less conserved and have greater variety since they are used in many subtly different mechanisms in the different branches of life. i.e. A helicase that's unwinding DNA for replication in bacteria has a different job to do than one that's unwinding dsRNA as part of RNAi in eukaryotes. That's not to say that there's no conservation, but less than for the fundamental nucleic acid mechanisms.  Which brings us to polymerization. That is, adding or removing one nucleotide at a time from a growing nucleic acid chain. This happens by the same mechanism in all life. A nucleotide-5'-triphosphate approaches the free 3'-hydroxyl of the chain. Two divalent cations (almost always magnesium), stabilized by 4 acidic amino acids (aspartate or glutamate), catalyze the release of pyrophosphate creating a sugar-phosphate link, growing the chain by one.  While the protein backbone that holds the active site in place has undergone the expected mutation over the eons, and while there is some small variation in the active site (specifically, the identity of the four acidic residues), all life uses the same exact mechanism, polymerizing (or depolymerizing) in the same direction, using the same chemistry.  Why? Well...we don't exactly know. But I did publish a paper speculating on one potential explanation."

Since heating vapour is difficult, it is likely that water would be heated under pressure as a liquid, then released from a nozzle to atmospheric conditions. The pressure required would be just over 7 earth atmospheres (~100 PSI). A higher degree of heating will also be required to negate the effect of Joule-Thompson cooling (when a gas is released from high to low pressure, it cools down)  The temperatures and pressures aren't beyond the realms of our engineering capabilities by any measure, the biggest challenge would still be providing the colossal amount of energy to heat up the water!"

askscience,3dqef4,StarManta,36,Sun Jul 19 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"Basically, with their orbits as they are, Neptune is actually never all that close to Pluto even though their orbits appear to cross. It would actually take a lot of energy to push Pluto into an orbit where it gets anywhere near Neptune physically. (The orbital inclination is a factor in this too - Pluto is far above the orbital plane of Neptune when it's as close to the sun as Neptune)  And because orbital resonance is stable, we can't just push it a little bit and wait for a few million years - we have to push it enough to get it out of that island of stability, or it'll stabilize back into its resonance."
askscience,3dqef4,Coronal_Eclipse,18,Sat Jul 18 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer-it's been a while since I studied this. If someone comes along and notices that I'm wrong, please correct me.  Basically, orbital resonance is the pattern created by two bodies orbiting a third parent body. For example, if planet A orbits a star once in the time it takes planet B to orbit twice, the orbital resonance is represented by a ratio A:B of 1:2. With how the orbits of Pluto and Neptune are arranged, the two bodies will never collide with each other.  This gif (found here) is an example of a ratio between the orbital periods of two bodies, but it is NOT an example of orbital resonance since Earth and Venus do not have the gravitational interactions that are characteristic of orbital resonance (thanks to /u/nhammen for the correction)."
askscience,3dqef4,nhammen,7,Sat Jul 18 16:21:54 2015 UTC,I should point out that the linked image is not orbital resonance For it to be orbital resonance there has to be a ratio AND gravitational interaction that makes this ratio stable to perturbations.

This gives a gravitational binding energy of 8.130691E39 joules. This is a ludicrous amount of energy. It would take over 3.5E22 Tsar Bombas to provide that much energy. I did this on a napkin and my phone, so if I'm off by an order of magnitude, my apologies. It's still more energy than we could harness.   Edit: formatting.   Edit2: I'm off by a lot of orders of magnitude because I used the wrong value for radius. It's still more energy than we can conceivably harness at 5.8E27 Joules. Sorry about that error."
askscience,3dqef4,VeryLittle,1214,Sun Jul 19 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"Oh boy! I did the math on a similar problem to this before.   If you were to make a ball of pure TNT and detonate it, would it be able to disperse itself, or would gravity be able to pull it back together? It turns out that with an energy density of about 4.2 gigajoules per ton, the maximum mass of a TNT sphere that can blow itself apart is half the mass of Pluto! So maybe since Charon is about 10% the mass of Pluto, we can take her out with TNT, but for Pluto we'd need nukes (and like /u/whodidyouthink said, we'd need billions of times more nukes than have ever been built by anyone anywhere ever)."

askscience,3dqef4,3226,8,Sun Jul 19 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"It's a very small amount of Uranium that gets converted into energy in a nuclear weapon. The Uranium atoms mostly split into Barium and Krypton, with three neutrons, which is the part that causes the chain reaction. When you add up the mass of the resulting bits, it's slightly less than the mass of the initial atom. That 'mass defect' is what has been converted to energy. It's about 0.1% of the mass of the U235 atom that is converted to energy.    But it doesn't work ideally anyway, as you don't get 100% fission, and some atoms decay to other things, and of course, you need the entire rest of the bomb.  The 'Little boy' weapon dropped on Hiroshima lost 0.6 grams of its mass, and it weighed 4400 Kg. So that's one ten thousandth of a percent of its total mass."

That seems like overkill if all you have to do is defend a planet.  How much less energy is required to simply break an asteroid into two bodies?  If you did it far out in an orbit, the two resultant bodies would be very unlikely to strike the Earth.  Of course, all you really need to do to deflect an asteroid is to knock it just slightly off course far enough out; a single nuke many many years out would do that.  But that's not as interesting to think about as the amount of energy required to split an asteroid into exactly two parts."
askscience,3dqef4,Traban,16,Sat Jul 18 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"I just did a quick check of the math on this.  Independent of the size and mass of the object, to split a spherical object in two and separate the pieces takes 37% of the binding energy of the original sphere.  So just splitting it in half takes you over a third of the way to destroying it entirely."
askscience,3dqef4,ILU2,13,Sat Jul 18 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue is that you can't guarantee a rock would break into two halfs.   First, even if it did, a rapidly spinning rock like in Armageddon breaking into two halves would be unlikely to do us much good. Especially if its the size of Texas and closer to us than the moon is. The pieces would still be spinning around their central axis as they were before and both would likely strike earth.  A mistimed explosion could send one half barreling toward us at an even faster rate while the other slows down and picks up speed again.   Lastly, its really unlikely it would just break into two halves. More likely, it would just split into a lot of pieces, which can't be guarranteed to miss earth. These pieces would have a larger surface area, so more would burn up in the atmosphere but suppose you blow up a 10 km rock into 5 1.8 km rocks with tons of smaller bits. You actually WORSEN the outcome for the planet because now the dust clouds that settle over the earth will be more evenly distributed, and the tsunamis and impact events too."

Sort of like a cosmic game of billiards, starting with a small object and colliding one into another, getting larger and larger until we have one big enough to destroy Pluto.  It might take a few centuries just to figure out all the objects' orbits just to do the math, and more than a few thermonuclear weapons launched on trajectories to tweak the orbits of comets and dwarf planets, but it's possible.

I imagine, to most people, ""destroying Pluto"" involves shattering it into multiple chunks, each perhaps smaller than an eighth of the original planet---does this preserve a lion's share of the gravitational energy, changing the relevant equation?"

askscience,3dqef4,Dalroc,6,Sat Jul 18 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"First of, some disclaimers. The solar panels will be highly ineffective after we get beyond the orbit of Mars, which is the majority of the flight, so I will ignore them. I also assume that the ISS battery units can supply the same power for the journey, which they would not. Therefore, this is not applicable in real life, but it's just a kind of estimation.    The most viable option for a constant acceleration is an ion thruster.  After some quick clicking around on Wiki, the best ion thruster I could find was the HiPEP, with around 0.5 N per 25 kW.  The ISS has 24 battery packs of 6.6 kW, which gives us: 24 units * 6.6 kW/unit = 158.6 kW.  As each thruster requires 25 kW, we get: 158.6 kW / 25 kW/thruster = 6.344 thrusters.  So lets say that 0.344 thruster worth of power extra goes toward keeping some vital systems in operation.  So with 6 thruster we get a force of: 6 thrusters * 0.5 N/thruster = 3 N.  Next up we calculate the acceleration: 3 N / 45,000 kg = 6.667 * 10-5 m/s2 .  This is a very small acceleration, but there will also be a long time, so it might add up, let's check.  The distance to Pluto is around 33 AU, or 4.775 * 1012 m.  Now let's calculate how long it will take: d = d0 + v0*t + a*t2 /2   As d0 and v0 are both zero, we get: t = sqrt(2d/a)  t = sqrt(2 * 4.775 * 1012 m / (6.667 * 10-5 m/s2 )) = 3.785 * 108 s  That is 4380 days in case you wonder. 12 years.  So, now we have the acceleration and the time it takes and from this, we can get the final impact speed!  The speed will be: v = 6.667 * 10-5 m/s2 * 3.785 * 108 s = 25,235 m/s.  Now lets look at the kinetic energy:   45,000 kg * (25,235 m/s)2 = 2.866 * 1013 J  As /u/whodidyouthink caluclated, we need 5.8 * 1027 J to destroy Pluto, so even at a 100% conversation rate, which isn't even close to realistic, we would still barely scratch the surface.  There was even more energy in the Chelyabinsk meteor, at around 20,000 m/s and 12,000,000 kg. That's over 150 times more energy in the Chelyabinsk meteor."

In the way of destructing the planet, ok , Consider a tight x-ray beam transmitter around the orbit the sun at a distance similar to that of Mercury, and a receiver around the orbit of Pluto and it's moons. The first ""problem"" would be to increase the overall thermal energy in that system and basically what you could do is by creating a structure that can fire at perigee for each of the moons, bring their orbits into an alignment that will cause them to fall into the Roche limit of Pluto itself.   From there, with a single body to manage, you get into the business of transporting trillions of tons of ice and free radicals via railgun off the surface of +sized Pluto, as time goes on, these water exports would be shipped all over the star-system, Venus, Mars, and where-ever else water and the cocktail of radicals are needed.

Otherwise the board is already distributing your weight.  What determines how much weight the board can support is the buoyant force, which only depends on the amount of water the board displaces. Specifically, the total weight it can support is (Vρ-m)g, where V is the volume of the board, ρ is the density of the water, m is the mass of the board, since it has to support itself, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is about 9.8m/s2.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the audio waves produced by the receiver are also Doppler shifted. For radio waves sent via AM, the audio information is encoded by modulating the amplitude of the wave. That is, the amplitude of the wave is varied periodically. It turns out that the single wave can be written as a sum of individual waves with different amplitudes, and this encodes the audio information. For FM radio, the frequency is modulated instead. You can then show that if the radio wave is Doppler shifted, then so will the audio wave produced by the receiver. For digital radio, the audio will have no Doppler effect, and that's because the information is encoded in a much more complicated way.  So for AM and FM radio on your car radio, if the radio waves are Doppler shifted, so is the audio. But again, because the shift of the radio waves is very small, so is the shift of the audio waves. So your music is actually a higher (or lower) note than it should be. But the change is not perceptible by humans. For comparison, a speed of 10 m/s corresponds to only a few thousandths of a hertz of frequency change. The lowest key on a piano produces a note of 27.5 hertz, and the change from one note to the next is exponential, so that the second key produces a note of frequency 29.14 hertz. So a difference of a few thousandths of a hertz is essentially no change in the perceived note."

askscience,3dvqbv,garrista,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"Loss of synaptic plasticity.  Our brain consist of nearly a hundred billions neurons. Each neuron, on average, is connected to thousands of other neurons. From puberty up-to the end of our life the number of neurons and the connection topology is pretty much the same (with some notable exceptions). That is, if we looked inside the brain of the 13 year-old and could mark one neuron as 'A' and two other neurons it's connected to as 'B' and 'C'. Then if we were to go back when that child is in their 70's we'd almost certainly still see neuron A that is connected to B and C.  But while the map of neurons A, B, and C does not change, the strength of connections will. If at age 13 we were to give an electrical shock to neuron A, and measure the response in neurons B and C, we might see that the magnitude of B's response was the same as C's. But if we shocked neuron A at the age of 30, then we may see that B has a larger response than C does. And if we went back at 50 we may see C having a bigger response than B.  This is called synaptic plasticity, and is key to how we learn new things and solve unseen problems. It's our ability to regulate the connection strengths between neurons, or bundles of neurons, that is how we learn. Take learning to drive. Suppose neurons A were responsible for seeing the road, the B neurons analyzed all possible choices, and the C neurons corresponded to our hand movement. When we first start driving we see the road, analyze the right choice to make, then move the steering wheel. So in this case A activates B a lot and C barely at all, and it is B that fully activates C. After some experience we just respond to the road without really ever thinking about what to do. In that case the connection strength between A and B weaken, while connection between A and C strengthen - we see and respond without really thinking.  Similarly for puzzle solving it relies on our ability to quickly integrate different areas of the brain - areas of logic, geometry, memory, language, etc. Solving a puzzle is just another form of learning.  As we grow older we gradually lose synaptic plasticity. It still exists in some form, but the mechanics become much slower and it is much harder to make really strong. This is likely due to the general loss of the cells' ability to rapidly turn over intercellar proteins and extracellular signals. Particularly the extracellular proteins that regulate calcium signaling, and the extra cellular protein BDNF which signals neurons to strengthen their connections."
askscience,3dup25,syzygy919,15,Sun Jul 19 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"So, as you know, the speed of light is independent of its wavelength: changes in the wavelength (or equivalently, the frequency, since its frequency is the reciprocal of its wavelength) do not affect the speed at which light travels.  However, the energy carried by light is dependent on its wavelength:  the energy is directly proportional to the frequency of light (and so it is inversely proportional to the wavelength).  So when light is redshifted, its speed doesn't change, but its wavelength gets longer, which means its frequency gets smaller, and therefore its energy decreases.  Hope that helps."
askscience,3dup25,hikaruzero,4,Sun Jul 19 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"Time and space are components of something called a four-vector. When we switch inertial frames in SR, the components of that vector change according to the well-known Lorentz transformation laws. So you end up able to derive all of the usual SR phenomena like time dilation, length contraction, etc.  Energy and momentum are also components of a four-vector, which transform similarly. For a photon, the energy and momentum are functions of the frequency. So switching inertial frames equivalently changes the frequency of a photon. The speed of the photon is left unchanged."
askscience,3dup25,Midtek,2,Sun Jul 19 22:39:00 2015 UTC,"the simple answer is light always travels at the same speed (c) if the the observer is moving in relation to the source the light leaves at c, travels through space at c, and arrives at the observer at c. but light's speed never varys instead the ""energy"" of the photon makes up for it. if the source is moving away then the photon gives up a bit of its energy(in the form of frequency or wavelength) in order to maintain speed. if source is moving towards the observer some of the energy is subtracted and given to the photon, making its frequency/energy higher (blue shifting).  of course all the real scientists are cringing, but i tried to make it as simple as possible so you could understand."

I think what he was trying to state that regardless of what the source and observers relative velocities are, c does not change because of it, but that only the wavelength and frequency of the photons change.  And I may be corrected here, but you could still observe red/blue shift in a different medium with a slower c, all other factors remaining equal.  Red/Blue shift is relative wavelength/frequency changes, so the light does not literally turn red or blue as we know the colors, but the light wavelength alters in the direction of red or blue as the source and observer relative velocities change. The wavelength change might only be 30nm in total, but with accurate measurement of the light wavelength you can see the phenomenon."

askscience,3dup25,JDepinet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"There's something about the physical picture that you are missing here:  upon interacting with a material, photons no longer stay photons, they become polaritons (a quasiparticle-like quantum mechanical coupling between a photon and vibrational/excitation modes of the bulk material), which depending on the type of polariton, are similar to photons in many ways but different in a few.  Polaritons have a nonzero effective mass, and therefore travel slower than light in a material.  In a valid sense, the photon doesn't exist inside the material once it is absorbed at the boundary; only the polariton exists inside the material.  This picture isn't just an effective/approximate description of ""a photon being constantly absorbed and re-emitted"" either, because there are aspects about the interaction that can't be explained by simple absorption and emission.  For example, materials typically have an absorption spectrum, and the individual atoms would only absorb and re-emit certain frequencies of light.  However, all frequencies of light will experience diffraction and a reduction in speed in the material compared to light's speed in vacuum.  This aspect can't be explained through absorption and re-emission because those frequencies that wouldn't be absorbed shouldn't be affected, yet we know experimentally that they are.  Hope that helps explain.  To quote the Wiki article linked to above:  ""Whenever the polariton picture is valid, the model of photons propagating freely in crystals is insufficient. A major feature of polaritons is a strong dependency of the propagation speed of light through the crystal on the frequency."""

askscience,3dup25,JDepinet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"There's at least three mechanisms for redshift (that I know of).  They all, of course, cause the observed wavelength to be longer than the emitted wavelength... all the while letting the photon travel at the speed of light (c) as required.  1)  The observer and emitter are moving apart from one another.  For ease of discussion, think of the observer as being at rest and the emitter moving away from the observer.  In this case, an easy way to think about it is to look at the crests of the electromagnetic wave that the emitter is emitting.  They are separated by a small time t = lambda/c, where lambda is the natural rest wavelength.  The oscillator (or atom) that is doing the emitting really only knows about that period.  As the emitter moves, subsequent crests of the emitted wave are being emitted at a point farther and farther from the observer.  This stretches the wave, increasing its wavelength.  2) The emitter is down low in a gravitational potential, and the observer is up high.  In this case it's easy to think of the photon as climbing out of the gravitational potential and thereby losing energy.  Since E = hc/lambda, a loss of energy increases the wavelength.  The photon can travel at speed c the whole time, of course.  3) The cosmological redshift.  In this case the emitter is far away from us (the observer), and the photon travels through space as the universe expands, until we receive it.  What's happening here is that space itself is expanding, including the space between the crests of the electromagnetic wave.  So, those crests are getting farther and farther apart as the universe expands, so the wavelength of the photon increases.  Each crest of the wave still travels at the speed of light, c, but the crests behind the first one have more distance (space) to travel through!  Of course explanations (1) and (3) don't seem to make much sense if you think of the photon as a particle... this is a great example of the art behind particle-wave duality, where a judicious choice of how you're looking at it makes the physics easier to understand."

In plain English that means that the nerve cluster that controls heart rhythm is spazzing out.  The heart is beating, but in an uncoordinated way that moves blood inefficiently or not at all. You shock the heart, causing it to momentarily stop, then hopefully the SA node will reflexively establish a normal rhythm.

Even though it's better than dying, a defibrillator can damage the heart, so basic protocol is just to do CPR.

Here's a link to volume's etymology dictionary entry. Let me sum up the history of the word:  The Latin word volvo means ""to turn"" or ""to wind"" (you see this in ""-volve"" words like ""revolve""), this led to the French using the word volume to describe a scroll or a bound book, which was adopted by English to mean the same. It then came to describe a book within a set, and then circa 1520, they started to use the word to describe the size of a book. 100 years later, they started using the word to describe bulk, mass or quantity.  So how did ""Volume"" come to describe loudness? It was simply a natural application of the word. It occurred in 1784 in a review of Handel's ""Messiah"" in the context ""volume of sound"".

Yes, volume can be related to pressure by the ideal gas law and others, but that's irrelevant here.  Pressure transients can also be carried by waves which do not involve a net volume change.  (In fact, the short-term change in volume occupied by some parcel of air is negligible for sound--this is required for the acoustic approximation to the Navier-Stokes system of equations.)  Speakers do not create volumes of air, nor do they cause net displacement of volumes of air.

askscience,3dw0xo,wazoheat,0,Mon Jul 20 02:07:28 2015 UTC,"Not directly, but it is well known that a colder climate results in a more unstable ozone layer, leading to the reactions which cause the breakdown of the molecule and the ""ozone hole"". This is why the holes in the ozone layer are centered over the poles, with the antarctic hole being the largest. So, as the earths atmosphere warms up through radiative forcing, the holes over the poles will decrease in size. :)"

UV radiation lives on the left side of these plots out to about 0.4 microns (micrometers).  The big players in the anthropogenic greenhouse effect (CO2, methane, N2O, water vapor) have little to no absorption at these wavelengths.  So no, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission doesn't contribute much to blocking UV radiation."

There's a common misconception that black holes have extremely strong gravity simply by virtue of being black holes. In fact, outside of a spherically-symmetric object, it's gravitational field is indistinguishable from that of an equally-massive black hole.

If we did have the technology right now you have to realise that the platinum in the asteroid isnt a solid chunk of metal (i assume), you cant chop off a chunk and go home. Similar to how its found on earth it must be extracted from large amounts of rock. Probably the most efficient method would be to actually divert the rock to earth and have it crash.

If its large enough to be economically worth mining, it will certainly be devastating to earth on either a local or global scale. So my logic states that an earth impact model is out.  If we were able to divert it into a stable orbit around earth, that would give us the time to be able to completely mine it at our leisure. However, as you already stated, it won't be in pure elemental form, and will be in 'ore' or 'alloy' form, meaning the bulk of the asteroid will have to be sent down to earth for processing in order to get any real economical value from it. That in itself would be very costly. Not to mention the associated risk of the fact that you'll have a massive rock orbiting the earth, capable of smashing satellites and even possibly setting off a Kessler effect kind of cascade, putting us all into the dark and stranding George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in space.  I would think that the most logical and 'easiest' way to be able to do this is to guide the asteroid into geostationary orbit on the equator and have the hypothetical 'space elevator' in place close by so that equipment and supplies can be more easily transferred up and down. Current estimates of a space elevator seem to mimic fusion reactors, meaning it is perpetually 50 years away from being technically possible.  The energy and precision required to get an astronomical body like a sizable asteroid to slow down into an earth orbit is enormous, and way outside of our current technical abilities. Mining celestial bodies is many, many decades away."

I am skeptical of the claims that we currently have the techniques necessary to mine an asteroid (while in orbit) in an economical way. Most of the mining, blasting and drilling techniques I am familiar with depend on the presence of both gravity and water. Unless the asteroid impacted the ground without dispersing too much, I don't see how we could mine it economically with current mining techniques.    And one should also keep in mind that introducing an immensely large amount of a given commodity on the spot metals market would collapse the price, further making a space-based operation difficult to sustain economically"

This is because lasers are generated by exciting an electron in an atom and letting it relax (in short).

No, Laserlight is coherent meaning all photons are in phase.  Normal light does not have this property.  Some materials can absorb normal light and only emit it when hit by another photon. The so emtitted photon is then in phase to the first one. And that's exactly how you build many lasers."

I believe the upper limit in wavelength for lasers is due to the electron state energy. Since you only have quantas of energy released depending on the electron state you must have minimum amount of energy between two states that limits the spectrum you can reach.   I am definitely not an expert on that topic so you might want to wait for another answer. Moreover there is probably some tricks you can do with frequency multiplier materials.
askscience,3duq04,An0k,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:16 2015 UTC,"Three things:   (a) it is possible in principal. But you need a lasing transition in the radio range, i.e. below 1GHz, or 5micro eV. This is much lower than room temperature, so you would have to cool down your device to lower than 0.1K to avoid thermal interference. (b) it is much easier to start with an optical laser and down convert it to longer wavelength. At least THz laser pulses are frequently generated this way (c) a radar naturally already has the most important laser property: it is coherent radiation. So there is really no reason for a laser-like approach"
askscience,3duq04,PresidentUlysses,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:31:46 2015 UTC,"In response to the above:  (a) While it is true that you need a laser transition in the radio range, it is not necessary to cool down the device to such low temperatures. Masers have been built to utilize the hyperfine transitions in Hydrogen atoms, which, due to their lower energies, give microwave frequencies.  (c) Again, that is not enough. A laser gives you coherence (i.e. there is a definite phase relation in the radiation coming from the laser) as well as directivity (i.e. a collimated beam). A radar does have coherence, but directivity is not at all comparable to that of a laser."
askscience,3duq04,udax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"(a) yeah. you are right. they do exist. But the problem with long wavelength/low energy emitters is that their lasing states are interacting with the ambient material(since they are below kT = 25meV@300K). This is why masers commonly either have to be cooled down  (even more so for radio masers), or work with really dilute materials to minimize interactions - this reduces the intensity obviously. (c) directivity is generally very difficult to achieve with radio waves: the wavelength is huge (meters and above). So unless you build a 'laser' with these dimensions, you will hit the diffraction limit right away. But if size is not an issue, you can make directed radio waves easily: just use a point source and a big parabolic mirror."

This iridium anomaly acts as one of the strongest pieces of evidence to a meteor impact being the cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs.  That being said, there is a deposit that is associated with a meteor impact in Sudbury, Ontario.  Sudbury sits in an impact basin from a meteorite impact 1.8 billion years ago.  This impact fractured the crust and caused magmatic material to infill the cracks and basin.  This material was rich in minerals like nickel, copper, platinum group elements, and gold.

That doesn't mean you'd want to drink from a rain barrel in Shanghai which has never been washed.

There is a very simple reason for this - a raindrop began it's life as (at least one) cloud droplet, and that cloud droplet had to form on a solid or liquid particle in the atmosphere, which is something other than water.  Those thing could be desert dust, sea spray, organic pollutants, or biologicals. The notion that rainwater is dirtier in more polluted environments is certainly right - but that's because the cloud drops form on air pollutant particles (aka - haze). As was mentioned rain drops can pick up other particles and water soluble gas molecules (sulfuric and nitric acids) during their time in the air. In fact rain is a very effective cleanser of the air -- so whatever was in the air before the storm came (in terms of pollutants) is being deposited to the ground or your glass of rainwater that you're interested in drinking.   Everything from desert dust, sea spray, smoke, urban haze pollutants, and even viable bacteria have been found in significant abundance in clouds, rain, and snow!

Sometimes rainwater is potable (or, safe to drink).  Rainwater is formed by clouds (to absolutely oversimplify clouds, boiled water vapor) condensing into raindrops. So when the water leaves the cloud, in theory it should be not indifferent from distilled water.  The issue arises when the clouds floating around are near sources of pollution: When it comes to rainwater, these sources are mostly atmospheric pollution! So that pollution would be natural stuff like volcano ash, but more importantly janky places like coal plants, smog centers (Los Angeles), and pretty much any other place with a plume.  I've harvested rainwater many times in the mountain, but usually I'm using my tent as a funnel into a pot to collect, and most of the time boil that pot of water.  tl;dr is that the rainwater picks up atmospheric pollution in locations with atmospheric pollution.

askscience,3dwpi8,KevZero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Good explanation. I think a very helpful way of thinking about the last paragraph is this: when you take some object, look at it, and then turn it to face the mirror and look at the reflection, the left and right sides of the object will, of course, become swapped. The mirror didn't do that, though, you did when you rotated the object on its vertical axis to face the mirror. A 180 degree rotation around the vertical axis followed by a front-to-back reflection is exactly the same as doing a left-to-right reflection. If you turned something to face the mirror by flipping it on its horizontal axis, the mirror image would have top and bottom reversed."

We're used to people facing us by turning around, and when we see our mirror image facing us we automatically interpret it that way.

If we had causality violations, we'd lose predictive power in physics—we would not be able to attribute causes to effects or predict effects of causes. A causality violation has never been detected in any experiment which suggests that faster-than-light transportation of information is impossible.    That 60Symbols video is very good, among my favorites. They are quite right, among causally disconnected events (A and B simply happen, neither causes the other), which happens first is relative to the observer and different observers will disagree.    The reason causality is saved is that lengths and times will also warp to maintain the constancy of the speed of light. While observers will disagree on the order of disconnected events, they will also agree that both events occur and they will always agree on the order of causal events. Never will two observer witness diverging and different events.  You can tell whether or not two events can possibly causally connected by the spacetime interval between them. Check out this diagram of a light cone. If A is the origin, then for B to possibly cause A, it must at least be in the past light cone and for B to result from A, it must at least be in the future light cone. This is the minimum requirement."
askscience,3dul7g,AsAChemicalEngineer,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"So the short answer is that if, when plotted on a space-time diagram, the line connecting two events makes an angle of less than 45 degrees with the horizontal axis, two observers can disagree on which happened first, and possibly which caused the other.  However, if the line makes an angle of greater than 45 degrees, all observers will agree on which happened first."
askscience,3dul7g,DaveBeal,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"For most events, there does have to be agreement on which one happened first. If I stub my toe, and then I say ""Ow!"", any observer in any reference frame will agree that ""Ow!"" came after stubbing my toe.  The exceptions are events which are very close together in time and very far apart in space. When the time interval t and distance interval r satisfy the inequality c^(2)t^(2) < r^(2), we say the events are separated by a ""space-like interval"". The observers may disagree on whether t is exactly 0 or not, but all observers will agree that the events are separated by a space-like interval.  How does this preserve causality? Well, if you do some algebra, you can express that inequality as r / t > c. That is, something would have to travel faster than the speed of light to get between the two events. Because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, A can't have caused B and B can't have caused A, so it doesn't matter if people disagree about the order they happened in.  In the video's example, everyone agrees that the train survived because the blades did not hit it. They only disagree on what order the blades didn't hit it in.

askscience,3dwfp9,Mindmaster107,5,Mon Jul 20 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"A non-polar liquid will not have surface tension, but you will still get a smack.   This is completely wrong.  Oil has a surface tension (with air).  Benzene has a surface tension (with air). In general, there is a surface tension associated with every interface of dissimilar materials. Steel has a surface tension with air.  Glass has a surface tension with air.   This shockwave temporarily makes it act as a solid.   It's not a shockwave, it's an ordinary pressure wave that moves at the speed of sound in the material; also, the fluid doesn't act like a solid.  It acts exactly like a liquid - obviously, because it is a liquid.    The viscosity will determine the smack; With high viscosity like Bitumen (A rock that flows 230 billion times slower than water) hit you like solid solidness, and low viscosity liquids like alcohol will let you sink into it no problem.   This isn't right either.  The problem (or most important parameter) is the density of the fluid, not its viscosity, because the density tells you how much mass needs to be shoved aside in order to accommodate the volume of your body over a particular period of time, and therefore the force required to do so.  When this force exceeds the strength of the materials that make up your body, you suffer injury. The viscosity matters in that it acts as sort of a ""mass multiplier"" - the fluid engages some water around itself and forces that to move as well - but the Reynolds number of someone hitting water from a great height is large enough to neglect viscous effects. An inviscid fluid with the density of water would still kill you after, say, a 100m fall."

But I assume that wasn't your question (if it was, let me know.)  Once the clouds are formed, sun rays don't affect them directly because clouds are poor absorbers of short-wave radiation (which is the lenghtwave in which the sun emits). Most of the incoming solar radiation gets reflected back to the top of the atmosphere by clouds, and they also scatter the visible light in a way that makes clouds appear white, but they don't get heated or evaporated by direct solar radiation.   Hope it helps. Sorry for bad english :P"
askscience,3duro7,lighhht,2,Sun Jul 19 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"The prior answer is quite right. The sun provides the energy to the earth system, so in that sense ""energy that came from the sun"" is responsible for heating the Earth and the air above it. This heating is one reason that air rises. When air rises, it cools. If it rises relatively quickly, it cools so fast that the water vapor becomes supersaturated - it then condenses out on small particles in the atmosphere. These small particles come from both natural sources (like sea spray or desert dust) and man-made ones (wildfire smoke, car or power plant exhaust).  The droplets that result from water condensing on such particles are cloud droplets.  This is essentially how a cloud forms.   Some of these particles are colored (eg desert dust), brown (smoke), or black (soot from combustion).  If these particles are at the heart of droplets within a cloud, they can cause the cloud to absorb energy from the sun - just like how wearing a black shirt on a sunny day makes you hotter than wearing a white shirt.  The light energy absorbed by such ""atmospheric brown clouds"" can hear the air around them. This can actually cause the cloud to evaporate!    These types of brown clouds are not everywhere on the Earth - they are very common in South Asia. The clouds there form on particles produced by Asian deserts and also the seasonally common plumes of smoke associated with burning in the region (often controlled burns for agriculture).   This is definitely a special case, but it does give a real example of how direct sunlight can affect a cloud. The vast majority of the time, clouds reflect sunlight back to space, giving a cooling effect to the Earth."

In order for that condensed water to evaporate it must first warm up to a pretty high temperature and then once it starts evaporating it is constantly cooling itself down and slowing down the process.  The more humid the air the slower the evaporation will proceed, or the hotter the water (or air) needs to be to evaporate at the same rate as in a less humid environment."

First, we do live in a four-dimensional universe, with 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, although some models posit more than that. So most waves that we see (sound, light, etc.) are waves living in four dimensions. Do you have a different definition in mind such that these waves wouldn't count?  The other reason is that ""waves"" are very, very, general, and there are many types of them. Are you thinking of something more specific?

For waves, it's actually the best example, this is true for spartial changes as well. Us 'living' in three spatial dimensions should probably rather be expressed as us 'perceiving' three spatial dimensions. There are a lot of phenomenons in our world which are only 2 or 1 dimensional, and if we could only perceive them we would say we live in a 2D world. If we were completely blind and could only somehow measure the gravity gradient of the earth, we would think we live in 1D because we only perceive up and down, though trough around moving in different x-y directions would give us evidence we may live in a 3D world if we were to move up a hill for example."

That's not a limitation of how much time there is, that's just a point of geometry - all motion is just changing co-ordinates in space-time, not space alone.    Moreover there are rules about how you can change your space-time co-ordinates. The speed of light is a rule about the maximum rate at which you can change co-ordinates (but all the subtlety is in how you measure / observe it).    The angle of 45 degrees thing is just a visualisation tool, and it's an artifact of selecting the right units - no inherent meaning. For example if you want to graph the path of a photon in flat space and you choose seconds on your time axis and light-seconds on your distance access, voila, the light ray moves at 45 degrees to it's origin.    But if your question is more general, i.e. why is there any angle that limits ""speed""? Well, that's a lot deeper, but I am still not sure the idea of there being a limited quantity of time is going to help us there..    If you probe around the question of what time actually is, in my opinion there are still no sensible answers to that question. Instead you could look into the question of what would happen if some particles had no speed limit at all? But realise that time is inherent to the whole idea of motion, and change itself.

However, AFAIK, the extent of these cones has no limit except for the Big Bang at one end and the death-by-entropy of the universe on the other end.  Also, the expansion of the universe also places a limit on events that we can interact with.  Outside of our own galaxy, everything in the universe is moving away from us at a speed proportional to its distance.  At a sufficient distance, this speed reaches the speed of light; this called the cosmic horizon.

As far as  I know it is not possible to really pinpoint, what time is, but from a philosophical point of view, time should be linked to change, since there is on one hand no possibility of change without time and on the other hand no measurement of time without change. If we accept this hypothesis we can proceed.  The current most accepted models based on general relativity predict, that the universe will expand faster and faster, which would mean, that matter gets spreaded out thinner and thinner.

They form in saturated air (but they must have a seed - like a spec of dust or ash or whatever) under the right conditions.  It has little effect on a combustion engine as water is one of the products, anyway. In some cases, water in the air actually increases power output.  Many power stations/generators that use turbine engines actually deliberately spray water into the intake. It has a great cooling effect (due to the latent heat of vapourisation of water) on the intake temperature, increasing power and efficiency.

For example, liquid air is 710 times denser than gaseous air at sea level. The densities of gases and solids are different because of the differences in their molecular structure. Solids typically have ordered lattice structures, which require molecules to be packed closely together in order to form bonds. Gases on the other hand consist of molecules moving freely through space, allowing for sparse separation.  The point is, if you tried to freeze the Earth's atmosphere into a solid it would take up a vastly smaller volume. In fact, if you took just the troposphere (the first 11 kilometers of the atmosphere) and condensed it into liquid air, it would be only one thousandth of its current thickness (it would only be 11 meters high).  So, to answer your question, the Karman Line would only reach tens of meters above sea level, because the atmosphere would lose so much of its volume if frozen solid."
askscience,3dszhz,JWson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:17 2015 UTC,"There is no one sharp boundary between outer space and an atmosphere, so any definition will be somewhat arbitrary. In practice, a ""space-like"" environment cannot generate lift, is in hard vacuum and doesn't cause significant drag. Unfortunately, these happen at different altitudes. At the Karman line, there is no lift. At the turbopause at 110 km, there is a hard vacuum, meaning that molecules move in ballistic trajectories with few mutual collisions. Thus, the counterpressure characteristic to a fluid phase disappears. Compositional averaging is no longer possible and molecules of different weight are thrown to different heights (as they have the same energy). Finally, drag appears already at very high altitudes, and completing an orbit isn't possible below 150 km.  So, the question is which definition to take. The situation you describe isn't theoretical, because Neptune's moon Triton and trans-Neptunian objects are cold enough to have nitrogen to solidify on their surface. Its thermosphere begins already at 8 km, with its already low surface pressure. But, the exobase is at 700 km, which isn't too different from Earth's; the lower gravity means the atmosphere is ""puffed up"", relatively speaking."

As Midtek observed, in general relativity gravity is not a force.  See Gravity as a fictitious force:   The notion of ""fictitious force"" comes up in general relativity. All fictitious forces are proportional to the mass of the object upon which they act, which is also true for gravity. This led Albert Einstein to wonder whether gravity was a fictitious force as well. He noted that a freefalling observer in a closed box would not be able to detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to an inertial reference frame (the equivalence principle). Following up on this insight, Einstein was able to formulate a theory with gravity as a fictitious force; attributing the apparent acceleration of gravity to the curvature of spacetime. This idea underlies Einstein's theory of general relativity. [See link above for references.]   Note that ""fictitious"" in ""fictitious force"" doesn't mean the force doesn't exist, but rather more that it's not fundamental - it's an apparent force that arises in certain reference frames, specifically non-inertial ones.   It would just be a direction.   There's a bit more to it than that. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime at a given point is described by a Riemann curvature tensor. You could use that to determine a direction in spacetime that a test particle in free fall at that point would travel, but a direction by itself isn't sufficient to capture the nature of the curvature.    There's a high-level description here:   In mathematics, specifically differential geometry, the infinitesimal geometry of Riemannian manifolds with dimension at least 3 is too complicated to be described by a single number at a given point. Riemann introduced an abstract and rigorous way to define it, now known as the curvature tensor."

The reason a magnet is a magnet is, roughly speaking, because the magnetic moments of nearby electrons want to line up parallel with each other. So imagine we had a long magnetic wire. At one end, we use a strong magnetic field to force all the electrons to point north; at the other end, we use a strong magnetic field to make them all point south.  Then, what happens in the middle of the magnet?  The answer is, a domain wall will form. This is a boundary between two magnetically different regions. A domain wall like this is said to be ""topologically"" protected. Just like a twist in a long ribbon, there's no way to get rid of that twist without doing something very violent to the ribbon (like cutting it and then gluing it back together).  Therefore, if you can precisely imprint different magnetic domains in a material, domain walls like this will keep them somewhat stable. There are other options beyond domain walls, as well.  TL;DR: The magnetization is (probably, I don't work for their company) localized by applying magnetic fields (or something similar) to different parts of the magnet, and they remain stabilized like that due to the nature of magnetic domains.  As for the usefulness, I can't really comment.  Edit: Okay, so I look a quick look at their site, and their products sound pretty cool. But I imagine that a lot of the details about how exactly they're able to make things work in certain ways are trade secrets, and probably more of an engineering problem than physics per se. I'll just list a few extensions of what I said above:  Once you do things like set up magnetic domains in a magnet, it will (perhaps obviously) no longer behave exactly like a typical north/south magnet anymore. For example, imagine that you had a disk that was oriented north on the outside and south in the center. Now if you approach the disk with the north end of a bar magnet, it will either snap to the polymagnet if you approach the center of the disk, or be repelled if you approach the edge of the disk.  Also, I mentioned that you can't easily get rid of a domain wall, but -- again, just like a twist in a ribbon -- you certainly can move a domain wall. Allowing motion of the magnetic domain boundaries is probably involved in their ""Align"" product, for example.  Edit 2: Since you asked about (dis)advantages, here's their webpage on applications. Of course they won't list disadvantages, but here are two. (1) Sometimes, you just want a plain old magnet, and these obviously aren't. If you just want to grab a piece of metal in an efficient way, then use a normal magnet. (2) As I mentioned, domain walls are stable unless you're particularly violent with them. In applications where there will be lots of stray magnetic fields (like in high voltage areas, outer space, and so forth) then these could become unreliable."

askscience,3dpifr,effervescence1,4,Sat Jul 18 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"A quick semantic note: some might say that your 'weight' would technically be the same regardless of the length of day, since weight is just mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, and both of these parameters are independent of how quickly the earth is spinning. However, your apparent weight is mass multiplied by the net acceleration that you undergo, and this is subject to change based on how quickly the earth rotates.  a*_centrifugal_* = v^2 / r v = distance / time   Assume that you are standing at the equator. The distance you travel over the course of one day is 2πr, where r is the radius of the earth.  r*_earth_* = 6.371 X 10^6 m d = 2*pi*6.371 X 10^6 m d = 4.003 X 10^7m  time = 6 hours * 3600s/ hour        = 21 600s   v = 4.003 X 10^7m / 21 600s     = 1853m/s   a*_centrifugal_* = v^2 / r                           = (1853m/s)^2 / (6.371 X 10^6m)                           = 0.539m/s^2   a*_net_* = a*_gravity_* - a*_centrifugal_*                 = 9.81m/s^2 - 0.539m/s^2                 = 9.271m/s^2   The percentage of your current weight with a 6 hour day would be:   a*_net_* / a*_current_* X 100%  9.271m/s^2 / 9.81m/s^2 X 100%   94.5%   That's less of a difference than I would have thought! One extra tidbit: the assumption that you are standing on the equator is important for this calculation. If you are standing at a higher/lower latitude, then the distance that you travel as the earth rotates is actually less, so there would be a lower centrifugal force and a lower difference between your current weight and apparent weight. In fact, if you were to stand directly on the earth's poles, you would travel 0 metres as the earth rotates, no matter how fast it spins, and so your apparent weight would not be affected at all!"

There is no real centrifugal force, but a centrifugal acceleration.  Centrifugal acceleration is the observed motion away from a rotating reference frame due to objects always wanting to move in straight lines in inertial reference frames.  So, if you're standing on Earth, in ECEF (Earth Centered Earth Fixed) coordinates you are not moving,  but in ECI (Earth Centered Earth Inertial) coordinates you are moving in a circle, which the center seeking force gravity creates. Otherwise without gravity or any way for us to hold on to earth we would be thrown out into space in straight lines, which would make us appear to be accelerating outward from the Earth's center i.e. centrifugal acceleration.  tldr: centrifugal accelerations are observed motions away from the origin of a rotating reference frame"

[Per the post above by effervescence1.] The centrifugal acceleration varies as T-2 , so to increase the centrifugal acceleration by 1/5.5% = 18.2 times requires a decrease in T of a factor of sqrt(18.2)=4.26. 6 hours divided by 4.26 gives 1.41 hours.

When you rotate around a center (in this case the center of the earth), there is a force that keeps you in a circular path, called ""centripetal force"" (in this case gravity). Basically it keeps your velocity vector (which is tangetial to the circular path) curving. When the rocket takes off, it eliminates the centripetal force (gravity), but it keeps its lateral velocity (called ""tangential"". It's the same velocity vector as before), which is very useful, because to achieve orbit you need a lot of lateral velocity."

M1 is the mass of the earth, and m2 is the mass of you. Radius is the distance between you and the center of the earth. From that equation you can see that radius has the greatest effect (doubling the radius decreases the force of gravity by 4x). Mass also plays a direct linear role.   Also yes, your body has gravity, but it's so small it's essentially negligible for anything useful. At the scale that it functions, electrostatic forces are way stronger."

If you were to suddenly speed up or slow down the rotation instantaneously, it would be catastrophic to the objects on the surface of the crust, and may actually tear apart the crust pretty badly.

Many people have already mentioned the effect  of the increased centripetal acceleration on objects on earth's surface. Because the earth is spinning faster you will experience a smaller gravitational acceleration. However, the earth's spin also effects the shape of the earth itself. Earth is not quite perfectly spherical, and in fact has a bulge at the equator (Called the Equatorial Bulge). Because of this bulge the radius from the center of the earth to the surface is large at the equator and smaller at the North and South Poles. This tends to further reduce the effect of gravity at the equator while increasing perceived gravity at the poles.  At the poles you do not experience reduced gravity from centripetal acceleration (your centripetal acceleration is 0), but you do see an increase because you are closer to the geometric center of the earth. The effect of both these things are relatively small, with today's earth they combine to amount to a ~0.5% difference in perceived Gravity from the equator and the poles."

NASA launched gravity probe B to measure the frame dragging effect around earth, and despite some technical mishaps, managed to salvage data which strongly supported the General Relativity predictions (this is the first and only experiement to my knowledge that has attempted to observe this phenomenon).  As for the actual numbers, unless there is a simple formula for this, it would take me a few weeks/months of relearning/learning GR, but the effects are surely only detectable by the most sensitive and sophisticated equipment."

It's what we call a ""non-inertial"" reference frame, and it means that some of your high-school level physics equations don't work anymore. It's in this context that we see debates about whether or not ""centrifugal force"" is a thing. In an inertial reference frame it doesn't exist, but in a rotating reference frame, a centrifugal force term appears.

So long as you don't change the mass, gravitational attraction forces don't change, even if you spin much faster.  Any centripetal centrifugal force caused by the spin is an entirely different force than gravity. So, gravity doesn't change, you just have something else pulling on you aswell as gravity.  Possibly someone more qualified than I am can give a better answer in regards to frame-dragging and other non-Newtonian/relativistic issues, but my understanding is that in this regard the Earth's mass is too low at any reasonable spin rate to warp space-time enough to have a significant effect on gravity.

The contribution from centripetal acceleration is that a is no longer zero, but instead has a small component towards the center of rotation. Since you don't feel that acceleration, the acceleration that you do feel, and thus the percieved gravity, is lessened.

We're sensitive to the difference between random and fractal so its more real when programs generate things as they are in nature.  Fractals can also be used as simulations to model other fractal behavior for practical reasons, such as rust deposition and surface behavior of metamaterials.

If you iterate you process above, some numbers will grow larger and larger each time you iterate, and some numbers will not grow. If you mark points that diverge (grow larger and larger) in one color and points that don't grow in a different color, you will see the Mandelbrot set. The Mandelbrot set should have just 2 colors, for divergent and convergent (not growing), but many representations use different shades of a certain color to express how fast the number grows.

The wick is therefore oxidized once a reaction occurs (giving off electrons to another element, the reducing agent). The oxidizing agent accepts electrons from the wick and is therefore reduced (opposite of oxidized). Oxygen is a strong oxidizing agent (that's where the name comes from), so it is eager to accept the wick's electrons (makes both real happy). But there are other elements (like fluorine, prime example) which are even more eager to accept those electrons. You can light a candle (or metal, or anything that can be oxidized, like your hand for example) with fluorine or anything else that is an oxidizing reagent even when there is no air.  TLDR: candle doesn't like it's electrons, gives electrons to oxidizing agent (can be oxygen, but does not have to be) and makes both happy.

(There's also latitudinal libration, which I'm ignoring for simplicity.)  Since the earth's angular size from the moon is only about 2 degrees, the wobbling effect would be plenty large enough to make the earth rise and set completely over the course of a month. You would have to be within a few degrees of the boundary between the lunar near and far sides in order to see it cross the horizon, as opposed to just moving up and down a bit in the sky.  Bear in mind that because of the relative slowness of the moon's orbit, this would be a much slower event than a sunrise on earth, or even a lunar sunrise. Calculating the exact speed is tricky, because it requires modeling the moon's elliptical orbit and rotation, but we can estimate it. Assuming the earth's position in the lunar sky follows a sine curve with an amplitude of +/- 8 degrees and a period of one lunar orbit, then its maximum angular speed would be just under 0.08 degrees per hour. So it would take (very roughly) about 26 hours to rise or set completely."

In each case, the EEG went flat before the EKG did, indicating definite loss of consciousness before the heart stopped beating.  Generally if the heart stops beating suddenly from an otherwise healthy state the mean arterial pressure (MAP, read as: blood pressure) is going to start decreasing fairly fast. Lack of sufficient blood flow to the brainstem will cause unconsciousness faster than hypoxia would, and once the cerebral perfusion pressure drops below 50 the brain can't really autoregulate its blood flow anymore. The brainstem houses among many other things the reticular activating system a set of nuclei with widespread connections that appear to be necessary for the waking, conscious state. Underperfusion of these nuclei will lead to loss of consciousness.  In the immediate aftermath of clinical death,  brain cells will quickly exhaust energy stores as they are highly metabolically active. Without ATP, the brain cannot power its Na-K pumps and will quickly lose their voltage and ion gradients, coming to equilibrium with the fluid between cells.

The pulse of radiation produced would make you at best a “walking ghost” and at worst—if you managed to get them very close and hold them tight—kill you within a few hours. You might even see a blue flash. But no explosion. If they stuck together (after you dropped them because they are too hot) then they would get hot enough to melt, but still no explosion. Instead, you might get what's called a “fizzle”. They might get hot enough to start to burn in air, and that might be very vigorous, but no nuclear explosion.  The problem is that plutonium is very rare in nature (there almost isn't any), we have to make it in reactors and the mixture of isotopes which results from this is so highly active that it's quite hard to get a critical mass to stay together long enough to get a nuclear explosion going. This is why plutonium warheads use the implosion method—you need the shockwave of an already quite powerful chemical explosion to hold a critical mass of plutonium together long enough for it to produce a nuclear explosion."

Plutonium reacts so quickly, that for a plutonium bomb to work, you have to use the ""gun"" method, which is where you have a plutonium ball with a hollow core, and then you shoot a ball of plutonium to fill the core. You have to shoot it super fast, so that you get it put together fast enough that it doesn't start to blow apart before it gets fully together.   By the way, this isn't just theoretical.

U-235 on the other hand would fission if you got it together fast enough. Little Boy was in fact this kind of weapon. they made a plug of U-235 that was just sub critical and put it into the barrel of a 105mm cannon, and o nthe other end they put a torus of U-235 that was also just subcritical. such that when the gun fired it put the plug into the target and formed a supercritical mass of U-235 which then underwent a chain reaction converting a few percent of the 20 or so Kg of uranium into energy.  this is of course not particularly practical for a weapon because its large, massive and U-235 is kinda hard to get. whereas Plutonium can be made in breeder reactors (indeed the main component of ""nuclear waste"" is Plutonium.)"

askscience,3dsbep,alehander42,2,Sat Jul 18 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a nuclear physicist working in medical imaging and not a physician, so I can tell you very little about the medical part of the question.  I've been googling a bit (not too much) about the radium girls and... I haven't found specific data. I can't seem to find any data about what's the estimated dose that they were exposed to. After lots of googling I've found an estimate of of the activity of the paint at about 100 uCi/gram. Also, apparently, each dial contained at the end anywhere between 0.03 to 1 uCi of radium. link with some data  Now, despite what you might believe, radium is pretty safe to have in a sealed container in front of you. To give you an idea, in a hospital setting its common to work with 20,000 times that activity (20 mCi) of unshielded high-energy gamma emitters (somehow briefly... but still something that we touch with no protections) . Radium is mostly an Alpha emitter, therefore it's almost self-shielded. Alpha particles travel less about a micrometer inside solid/liquid matter, therefore even if you place an Alpha emitter on your skin it doesn't make damages.  However, they were licking the brushes! And breathing lot of radium dust and getting in touch with it everytime. When you ingest radium, it fixes in your bones instead of calcium. This means that you're going to have the source in direct contact with your cells for the rest of you life!! Biologically it's not going to be washed out and physically, since it decays in 1,600 years, it's not going to decay anytime useful.  This is an important thing to understand, often people confuse radiations with radiations sources. Those girls were not exposed to radiations while working (well... they did and probably with a middle-highish dose for today standards). They ingested radiation sources that emitted radiation continously from inside their body.  Now I'll try some math. Assume, from the data I've found, that they used 0.1 uCi of radium for each watch and Painted 100 a day. 10 uCi of activity in total. Given the numbers I've found the range on this number is anywhere between 1 and 100. Now, let's make a wild guess and assume that, by licking brushes, they ingested 0.1% of the paint. I don't know what's typical but I think that this is a conservative assumption (as in, likely they got much more). This means that they ingested 10 nCi a day or 2.5 uCi per working year.  If you make some back of the envelope calculations you find out that for each year worked there they ingested (using these very conservative estimates that take into account only radium contribution) an amount of radium that from then on continued to give them some 80 mGy (10 mSv) of radiation to the bone marrow every year for the rest of their life. This is cumulative. Therefore, if they worked there 1 year they got 10 mSv to the bone marrow each year, had they worked 2 they would get 20 mSv a year afterwards and so on....  This is really out of scale, and I considered only direct radium damage with conservative assumptions of exposure!!   As I stated this is extremely variable, depending a lot on how they worked, how much they ingested and lots of other factors. This might explain why some girls got leukemia or osteosarcomas in 4- 5 years since starting to work there and others went on to live for the rest of their life.  If you get 500 mGy to the bone marrow every year for 4 years in a row... There's not much statistics left anymore, you do get leukemia, sarcomas or both!  and... there's nothing you can do about this dose. You can't ""wash out"" radium from the bones. Furthermore, for what I read, the damages were so large that it's really unlikely that they fall in the category of best respondents to treatments.   Also, those kinds of cancers are not that easy to screen for beforehand."

From a quick view I've found In the first link that they state that the lowest dose associated with cancer was a total of 60 uCi (total over worklife).   The second link reports an interesting estimate of radium intake over the years, as regulations became more stringent. Apparently the estimated intake at the beginning was as high as 80 uCi per year!! (40 times what I estimated. So, instead of 10 mSv per year to the bone marrow from radium only that's 400. No wonder they got ill in 5 or less years!)  After licking brushes was stopped doses dropped to 0.7 or even less! (1/100).  I'll study these links better for sure in the future.   The state that the patient with sarcome who got the lowest dose got about 100 uCi of ingested radium, somehow in line with my estimates. Indeed I had linked a 2.5 uCi ingested dose with a 10 mSv damage per year, which is highis but within the acceptable range for exposed workers. So 100 uCi is 40 times that and it makes sense that it sky-rockets incidence rates!"

Fusion of deuterium from seawater is more efficient at 0.5%, but part of the energy would go to separating the deuterium.

askscience,3dn5s7,h4terade,6,Sat Jul 18 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"No. Fingerprints, and all biometrics are something you ""are"".   Something you ""have"" would be a key, an RFID card, a passport.  The ""have"" things can definitely be transferred / stolen, whereas things that you ""are"" cannot (well not without blood and knives)  Edit: There truly is only one ""you"" and in theory these biometrics are in fact unique, but our ability to positively determine that the unique body part in question is in fact the real one previously known has current issues that may not be easily or ever resolved. yes, fingerprint readers can be tricked today, face recognition algorithms can be tricked, iris or retina scanners probably are also imperfect.  So the idea of authentication being based on the uniqueness of ""something you are"" is based on the flawed premise that we can detect and reject these fake copies. Technology will improve though, not all fingerprint readers are the same. Some are crap and only do rough image capture, others measure skin temperature, skin electrical resistance, and look for other properties that are more of a challenge to fake.  So no secure system is perfect, all security systems have some kind of weakness. If something can be opened at all, it can eventually be opened by a well resourced and motivated person. We can only try to make it harder and harder so it's not economically feasible or would take too long (like trying all combinations to open a safe)."
askscience,3dn5s7,scubascratch,5,Sat Jul 18 06:59:20 2015 UTC,Isn't the topic of this thread the ability to duplicate fingerprints - thus rendering the distinction between something you are and something you have meaningless?

Even if you transplant new 3D printed hands with different fingerprints, I'm still 'me'.   Hey I'm not advocating for the industry, just providing a lay explanation for the basis of current biometrics products and research. I definitely agree you are you even with filament robo hands.    For the sake of an argument, I even think it's theoretically feasible    OK strapping in for liftoff ;-)   to phase out the brain into some other medium so long as it was done right and I'd still be 'me'. But that's neither here nor there.   Let's run with this because it's a fascinating premise and the source of some interesting science fiction I recommend. I think wet-brain -> other-medium (probably digital) is a possible future technology. Eventually even a non-destructive form that allows ""live backups"" to be taken. These backups could only run on hardware, unless biological cloning + reverse transfer to ""un partitioned clone brain"" also happens but just set that aside for a moment.  Let's say your mind transfer to other medium happens, like because of some traumatic injury which leaves your Original Body (""OB"") in a coma (you seriously should not have cheaped out on the motorcycle helmet). The transfer goes ok, with Virtualized Iplaymeinreallife (""VI"") waking up in cyber-ville and because you are the real iplaymeinreallife you are allowed to use the bank accounts, possessions, and rights of the original wetware. I believe this is your original premise.   Ok let's say VI, having survived such a close brush with death, and finally unburdened from a vestigial endocrine system constantly clouding your reason and judgement with the hormone chemical weaponry used in the war on reason taking place in OB, you undergo a change in outlook which decides that freeing yourself of possessions and hoarding wealth are in-compatible with your new objectivity, enlightenment, and purpose: so you give everything away to locate, capture, relocate, feed, and shelter the last of the much-maligned honey badgers at the newly built (on the former estate) ""Iplay Honey Badger Reserve"". You actually have to liquidate a considerable lifetime fortune in this pursuit, being virtual and all, and had to hire quite a few honey badger trappers and the travel and expenses are a huge headache to audit and keep under control, and let's not forget the ""Daallo Air D3188 incident"" and the huge relocation cost overruns associated with that. You (VI) make three notes following this: 1. An incorrect assumption that the ""pre-enlightened hormonally constrained"" flight attendants could be duped by such an absurd ""they're just ugly cats"" ruse; 2. Realization that there was in fact no hormonal basis for the habitual penny-wise/pound-foolishness which had surprisingly persisted post-mind-transfer; 3. The edit on Wikipedia listing sedative/CNS depressive effects of ""Jujubes"" had in fact been sourced primarily from one paper initially on ArXiv and then in final form on JIR. But after a few years of collection and refinement of operations, the reserve is up and running and more or less breaking even or at least not hemorrhaging galactibucks on the increasingly common years when a warmer spring leads to amorous refugees and the increased food/chainmail suit expenses.  Ten years down the road, long after the initial incident and transfer, with OB long ago put into long term suspended animation into the world wide tissue match reserve bank, another unrelated, but oddly cosmically coincidental, motorcycle incident happens in another part of the world. Thankfully New Rider (""NR"") was smartly wearing a decent helmet, but was still a bit of a squid and was stupidly wearing flip-flops while grinding his pegs doing 80MPH through the tight hairpins of the Dragon at Deal's Gap, and luckily the only injury was damage to the left pinky-toe nail bed, causing kind of a crumply toenail to grow back. Well this blemish really was going to have a serious impact on NR's potential future romantic encounters. Even concealed within a sock and a shoe, just knowing that the twisted nub of keratin would eventually have to be revealed (if not on the first conjugal encounter, at some point the ""socks on"" fetish would be questioned) would surely dampen his confidence and waste hours attempting to leverage liquid courage leading to the inevitable last call panic-hookups only reevaluated as acceptable through distorted beer goggles. So NR experienced only the smallest, nearly sub-conscious, wisp of guilt as he blinked hard when he put a big X on the checkbox next to ""Mobility Impacted (Asymmetric Gait)"" in the justification section of his submitted Form 27B/6 (Application for Tissue Match Search and Organ Retrieval) to find an ideal pinky-toe transplant. In the brief interval of closed eyes, he flashed back to a week earlier-the hour after the near-lowsiding of his mint vintage FZR1000 on the final switchback of the Dragon, limping uncomfortably into the vestibule of the E.R. with the repurposed Do-rag ""bandage/moccasin"" he was stuck with after being unable to find the left flip-flop despite a ten minute search, before collapsing into the compassionately-placed waiting wheelchair. The triage nurse assessed the gravity of the situation and prudently whisked NR Into the examination cubicle ahead of the obviously faking sweaty, pasty-faced, codger with the weirdly dangling limp left arm, with his obvious ""nitro-seeking"" act. The quack who came in moments later and injected him with novocaine at least managed to get it into the correct foot after completely failing to show the proper regard and sensitivity for the trauma he was enduring. Without even really trying, NR easily convinced himself in that brief blink, that the novocaine was obviously an incorrect large dose that would wear off any moment now and the crippling injury would return for good. While he knew in his heart that his plight was more parallel to Kunta Kinte than Captain Ahab, he had more immediate plans than becoming the source of literary inspiration. He completed the form and waited the typical 10-15 business days for a response and the expected freeze-packed donor toe.  By way of the yet-undiscovered ""Law of Universal Conservation of Karma"" (which waits anxiously for its time in the spotlight next to its brothers Mass and Energy, as the long sought missing piece in the incomplete Standard Model of particle physics) the recently ejected flip-flop-cum-missile tumbled in a ballistic trajectory which would intersect the narrowing space between a nearby milkweed plant and the weary but still fluttering Danaus Plexippus (DP) about to alight in a brief refueling stop after a particularly long leg of its annual journey from Angangueo, Mexico. In an uncharacteristically merciful and yet connected string of coincidences, two years prior, the Hong Kong machinist (HKM) working weekends at a job shop in Kowloon, tasked with programming the CNC mill tool path to carve a block of aluminum into the upper half of an injection mold to make summer footwear for fat gweilo feet. HKM had kind of bullshitted his way into this job and was only marginally familiar with the older CNC console. He was not foolish though and was afraid to push buttons he wasn't sure about, and unintentionally left an option turned on in the G-code generator that had been turned on hours earlier by the night shift operator who was working on a completely different job for another shop customer having contracted for the production of injection molds for the outer covering of golf balls. At least 50 minutes of time on the mill had elapsed before HKM realized something about the mold didn't look quite right. He found the oily, dog eared manual (a Xerox copy to match the surely pirated toolpath software), and realized what the setting did (a procedural surface finish leaving a pattern of tiny raised domes). HKM looked at his job order again which had a design drawing attached showing a mold surface finish somewhere between a crosshatch and small waffle like pattern. He checked his watch, and decided he didn't have enough time to start the part again and still complete the remaining molds he was on the hook for this shift. He decided that the little bumps on the flat parts of the mold were too small to make a difference anyway and he let the part mill go on and complete the automated cutting in another 10 minutes. He finished the rest of the molds that day with the correct finish and sent them off to the customer and despite a couple mildly restless nights he thankfully never heard a complaint. Within 24 hours the two halves of the size 13 mold were loaded into the injection molding machine on production line 4 at the King Sing PVC Shoe Company across the harbor and the machine was churning out size 13 flip flops. Usually line 4 could be relied on to cycle in 15 seconds but the shift supervisor had recently switched to a cheaper lubricant (pocketing the difference) with the result that the contraption could now only make about 200 shoes an hour, and the operator would have to work through dinner again to make the daily quota. After a 3 month journey across the Atlantic in a Maersk shipping container, one pair of the size flip-flops made its way to the Dollar Store in Knoxville where NR purchased them to ride the Dragon because his feet were too hot in the riding boots his mother insisted he wear.   to be continued"
askscience,3dn5s7,scubascratch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:34:10 2015 UTC,"The flip-flop eventually left his foot, heading on a path to surely impact the weary butterfly, but the dimpled texture on its surface created a thin boundary layer of turbulent air clinging to the sandal, and instead of crushing he poor flyer, it merely resulted in a tiny vortex which twirled the Monarch in a different direction. DP, embodying the apex of millions of years of climate-adapting-evolution, was equipped with the biological equivalents of a compass, inclinometer and sextant. With only three corrective wing flaps and a 30 degree clockwise left antenna tilt, DP successfully docked with the milkweed flower and slurped up enough Jet M (butterfly fuel) to continue on to the next stopover at the second branch from the top in a large maple tree left of the pond at Point Pelee National Park in Ontario. DP met a nice lady Monarch en route and they went on to create many adorable larvae, as well as a few troubled pupae who tarnished the family name with a scandalous ""Butterfly Rumspringa"" migration detour through Panama City Beach. The Monarchs Gone Wild video haunted the family for a number of years, even despite the persistently low adoption rate of broadband by the butterfly community in general. The result of the near collision with the flip flop was not without consequence though-in confirmation of the long mocked theories of Dr. Malcolm Jeffblum, the chaotic result of the third of the three corrective wing flaps shoved just enough extra molecules of nitrogen around to initiate a slight change in wind direction, which when had a tiny, but cascading effect on the weather over Chattanooga. The state of Tennessee, having effectively chased off any new major sports franchises with its excessive ""Professional Athlete Luxury Tax"" as well as alienating a large online retailer despite the company having a large employment presence with several warehouses and facilities in the state, was in search of new revenue sources after finally realizing that the  regressive state tax policy had in fact extracted all it could from the state's residents. It turned to the new ""tissue match organ bank reserve"" industry and converted the now-vacant warehouses and stadiums into long-term Suspended Animation Organ Reclamation Facilities (known as SAORFs by the locals and employees), which were essentially funded through the ongoing organ replacement surgeries paid for by the survivors of the post-death-panel-cataclysm. Tennessee found that the slow but steady income associated with replacement organs for an aging population was a good deal. They tried to be diligent and responsible and installed backup generators to keep the machines running. They even used an ISO 9000 certified consultancy to create the state's Disaster Preparedness Plan, who designed the backup power strategy for the facilities and even recommended a suitable vendor and procured the components. Tennessee had no way to know the chosen vendor decided to skim a bit and provide contactors which had solenoids wound with a minutely smaller wire diameter than requested, resulting in a grid-to-standby cutover time of at best 50 msec instead of the specified 25 msec. The weekly system generator test did not include timing the automatic cutover to millisecond precision so this discrepancy went undetected. When DP flapped that third flap, the cascading changes in wind lead to a particularly large thunderhead over Brownsville  one hot and humid August afternoon. Lightning flashed all long the horizon and the ozone started to activate the olfactory receptors of the Organ Harvest Technician (OHT) working that afternoon in the Chattanooga SAORF. The thunder was getting closer and louder. OHT kept one eye on the monitor full of color coded indicators tracking the status of various systems running the facility, and another eye on the Facebook page of an ex-girlfriend he just couldn't stop thinking about. When a particularly large lightning bolt struck an aging transmission tower four miles east of Hazel Green, Alabama, the backup 161kV transmission line it held aloft to conduct power from the Tennessee Valley Authority Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Reactor Unit #3 to the Moccasin Bend substation in Chattanooga underwent a brief voltage surge which in turn triggered the particularly sensitive protection equipment at the substation, recently outfitted with all digital monitoring and microprocessor relays, disconnecting the 161kV feeder. Normally this older transmission line was not even in use; usually Moccasin Bend was fed by a newer 230kV line from the Chickamauga Dam Hydroelectric Plant. But something not being covered in the news was going on at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and several primary power feeds had been switched around recently by TVA sending the majority of the Chickamauga capacity to Oak Ridge, leaving Mocassin Bend to depend on only the aging feed from Browns Ferry. When the protection tripped and the feed disconnected from the primary side of the array of step-down distribution transformers, 2,999 residential and commercial customers were cast into darkness. The one building with lights still on was the SAORF and OHT did not even notice the 50 msec flicker of the overhead lights as the building's power failed then automatically switched over to the running standby diesel generators. The extra 25 msec it took the under-rated solenoid to push the bus bars in contact with the backup power had little noticeable effect, except for a brief dip in the output voltage of a power supply and then an uncaught race-condition bug in the supervisory circuit of the robotic organ harvesting machine located in the lab with OHT. The brownout was properly detected by the circuit and even signaled the monitoring console, but OHT was so wrapped up in un-liking his exes Facebook posts that he didn't even notice the multiple red lights on the other monitor until it was too late. The harvesting machine was just about to begin the procedure of preparing a stored organ donor for harvesting. In this case the machine was going to collect a left pinky-toe for an injured but lucky person with matching tissue type. The race-condition bug left the harvester in an undefined state, and in this case it happened to have jumped right into the middle of the general reanimation function. Oblivious OHT noticed nothing until he nearly had a coronary when OB leapt out of the harvester pod. OB's head injury had miraculously healed during the suspended animation and he was quite wholly conscious and aware of his identity after a brief period of confusion. After a few days of recovery, OB looks into his affairs and discovers the entire honey badger preserve debacle. OB tries to recover his property and possessions, but VI mounts a successful ""I am the real me"" legal campaign and OB is relegated to living in a shanty made of corrugated tin on the outskirts of the reserve. OB becomes embittered and rage grows within. Eventually he just can't take it anymore and he starts smashing the 10 square meters of photovoltaic cells on the roof of the honey badger infirmary, incrementally cutting power to VI's host computer in 10% chunks. After the second cell is smashed, VI again marvels that ""cheapskate transcends biology"" and laments his decision against buying a backup power generator. By the time the 4th cell is smashed VI can be heard trying to bargain with OB over the intercom, offering at first half, then 3/4, then the entire honey badger reservation to ""please just stop smashing the solar panels!"". But OB has become unhinged-he gleefully smashes away as a melodious but fading voice can be heard singing ""Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true..."".  As the sun rises on the quiet honey badger reserve, with OB sitting in a pile of broken glass and silicon, sirens can be heard on the driveway. Police officers pull up and approach OB and take him into custody. Being an official non-person, OB is not even mirandized they just taze him and toss him into the back of the SAOHF van accompanying them. OB half heartedly cackles ""I'm the real me!"" But nobody else is in the back of the van to hear him...  The reserve quickly goes off the rails with nobody to run it. With nobody running the feeding machines, the refugees revert to survival mode and eventually escape the confines of the refuge. The local area is totally u prepared for the starving honey badger onslaught and several small dogs and children go missing before animal control brings the situation under control with an aggressive extermination campaign.  Who is the real you now?"

There's a video floating around of someone bypassing a fingerprint phone lock by lifting someone's print. I've also seen that silly facial lock that some laptops offer bypassed by using a photo. I think once something you are becomes easy enough that you can leave copies of it laying around, it becomes essentially something you have."
askscience,3dn5s7,h4terade,2,Sat Jul 18 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, fingerprints can be copied good enough for cheap scanners.  This will get better over time as technology improves. It does not mean the idea of biometrics is fundamentally flawed. The first key locks of 1500 years ago are of coarse easily defeated today probably by a bored kid with a bent wire. At the time though they were a huge advance over the previous ""no locks at all"" state. Mechanical key locks have evolved dramatically over time though and today the best mechanical security locks are very difficult to beat-no bent wire or cheap pick will open a well designed modern security lock. The same thing will happen over the next coming years: technology will be developed that figures out of a finger is real before deciding it has the right print. This isn't even that hard: sensors exist for blood oxygen level, pulse sensing, temperature sensing. These would make a more robust print reader right now. Also detecting capillary blood flow is also technologically achievable so it will just get better.  I think just because fingerprint readers designed a few years ago are easily defeated today doesn't mean a better more secure fingerprint reader can't be built."

Or, you know, you could spend the day trying to steal another phone. A phone which is worth 300-600 by itself. I have a feeling very, very, very few petty criminals would go through the effort.   So in summary, it is absolutely NOT-DIFFICULT to steal 500 dollars from me if you've stolen my phone, but I'm willing to bet I'm just as likely that some fictitious iPhone thief that is going to learn how to lift prints, get a supply of copper clad photosensitive PCB board, transparency printer and photo softer... that fictional thief is also perfectly able of carefully watching me absent mindedly enter my PIN while in checkout or at the bar or where-ever.   Someone else put it well: ""TouchID  is not a “strong” security control. It is a “convenient” security control.

They could lift a fingerprint to bypass Touch ID, has to be done within 24 hours, and you only get a few tries before its disabled.  The passcode allows limited atempts if entered wrong and can be set to wipe the phone after 10 atempts, though they might observe the user entering the passcode.  Find my iPhone can be easily thwarted by removing the SIM card and/or airplane mode(acess to control center on the lock screen can be disabled) but activation lock ensures that if the phone is restored, it can't be activated without the owners Apple ID password."

You should never expect any container to be uncrackable, you should expect them to be slow to crack.  And that's exactly what you're phone gets you, the GPS ensures that they are very fast to track when on. A thief therefore MUST turn it off immediately if they have any hope of getting away. But I can remotely disable all my accounts very quickly after getting a phone stolen. Sure an attacker can get my fingerprints and hack it, but there is simply no way they are doing that in under 12 hours, which is more than enough time for me to reset any account that may be vulnerable, request my phone is locked out and erased. It probably won't happen, but it means an attacker can't turn the phone on with internet access. Encryption means they'd need at a minimum some form of cracking software, depending on how it's implemented it may be quite difficult to crack (but generally crackable on a phone as they don't ask for cryptographically secure passwords on boot).  In short, the features of a phone don't lock an attacker out, it forces them onto the slowest path possible, requiring the most expensive and complicated setup you can conceive. That process makes it very uneconomical for an attacker, and for those few determined ones, well you can reset/lockout/change everything that matter before they can complete the process."

Lost mode is intended for lost, not stolen devices where there is hope that a finder will contact the owner to return the device, while remote wipe is intended to prevent acess to the owners data in case the theif were to bypass the passcode and/or Touch ID.

I think the stumbling block, as with a lot of product areas, is material choice. For a selective laser sintered part the vast majority of materials are Nylon-12 based giving hard parts. The addition of various fillers is used to alter the properties (usually trading off a gain in one for loss in another). In order to wear your shiny new fingerprints, either attached to skin or a glove they would need to be flexible. Otherwise, they wouldn't behave like fingers.

Intel call this approach ""turbo boost"" - clock speeds of each core are adjusted to maximise performance within the thermal design envelope.  Stacking dies has many issues that are yet to be fully resolved (layer-to-layer interconnects, electromagnetic noise) but the fundamental issue is that silicon is an exceptionally good thermal insulator. More transistors at the cost of poorer thermal management is a backwards step. Die stacking is a useful technique in some applications that aren't thermally constrained (high density RAM, miniaturisation for low-performance SoCs in mobile devices) but it doesn't buy you any extra performance.  A cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication plant costs about five billion dollars and will shrink your transistor size by about 30%.

For example, world over clocking championships where everything is LN2 cooled and doesn't really get any hotter than -100C, most over clockers only get around 150% increase, what keeps it going further?  Also in my own system, my processor will not hit 4.8ghz, despite giving much more voltage than it needs and also water cooled."
askscience,3dpbrb,sneakytreesnake,7,Sat Jul 18 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"Processor frequency is limited by a number of factors, most importantly memory latency and the speed of electricity. At a sufficiently high clock rate, communication between the processor and memory breaks down. The electrical signal just can't get from the CPU to the memory and back to the CPU fast enough. This is why GPUs (which run at very high clock rates) have their memory chips clustered in a tight circle.  This principle applies within the processor itself - if the clock rate is too high, the clock signal just doesn't have time to reach every part of the chip in time, causing the chip to lose internal synchronisation.  There is also an absolute limit on how quickly transistors will switch. Push them too hard and they don't have enough time to fully charge and discharge, so they float at an indeterminate voltage between logical 1 and 0."

If we can get the multi threading problems solved we can just down clock everything to utilise the voltage savings and therefore squared power savings.    In the short term what is going to happen is stacked chips.  Currently you can buy a gpu with memory stacked on top of the gpu itself.  The next step will be stacking those two on top of CPU cores.  This stacking reduces the latency to memory which should help with latency, which will improve performance efficiency.  Bringing extra functionality onto the cpu also improves efficiency.  Finally stacking can hypothetically let you not only bin individual cores, but also you could use different processes for different modules. So cpu cores can be on a frequency optimised process, gpu on density optimised, memory on power optimised and everything else on cost optimised processes.  This would bring huge power savings and performance improvements as currently different clock domains have to be supplied with voltage with the lowest common denominator taken into account."

This would annihilate all the benefits of the transistor stacking with the room needed for the passthroughs and the complex, longer circular routes.   And by the way, this would not necessarily be a good thing. The problem isn't all due to contact area with. The problem is that if you take all the transistors and put them in a tiny, tiny ball, all the heat will be concentrated in the same place.   Stacking brings lots of benefits, and we're seeing it used in low power applucations (flash and ram). But to translate it to more complex and power-hungry chips would be a nuclear headburst, with the hinderances overcoming the benefits. Until, that is, we find the appropriate method."

As I understand it the main issue with doing so is that it makes fabrication more expensive, in no small part because you have a higher rate of defects in the chips, meaning your yield goes to shit.   Nevertheless, that seems to be a more straight forward way to address problems with improved manufacturing technology ,than trying to indefinitely make transistors smaller or drilling coolant channels through the chip. If we can find ways to make chips with fewer defects ( or maybe make the design more tolerant to defects), then the total performance could improve by using a more complex set of instructions and making the chips bigger."
askscience,3dpbrb,waveswan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"The most common answer, as of the last decade and at least a lot of years to come, is to go multi core.   You can't improve the straightforward speed anymore? doesn't matter, add more cores!  Your software environment is fit for several cores? Slightly reduce the power of each core to reach a better efficiency balance and add more cores!  Your chip is too big and you have a high defect rate? Just laser cut a few cores off and sell it as a cheaper, less high-end alternative!  The problem being, here, that you need a software environment that is fit for it. It is completely true for graphics processors (and has been for a while, by the way). It is less true for general purpose processors, many tasks are really hard or even impossible to multi-thread.   A xPU is a really complex piece of engineering. You can optimize for lots of different {area, power, single threaded performance, multi threaded performance, price} sets. And each set is more or less fit for a given task.   Using a more complex set of instructions somewhat has the same drawbacks as going multicore. Basically, the goal of a big instruction set is to run several tiny instructions at once, just like a multi core processor would, with a few differences still. But the issue is the same: you need some kind of multi-threadable tasks to do it."

A sex drive would have developed to ensure frequent intercourse and increase the likelihood of pregnancy.

So it would have been sufficient for people to just want sex,  and then want to care for their kids once they are born.  You wouldn't need an instinct for wanting kids.   Birth control has changed all that  though.  And I bet as time goes on  (many many generations)  the instinct to want children will become much stronger out of necessity."
askscience,3drw3j,Deto,-2,Sun Jul 19 07:51:17 2015 UTC,"I think with your last statement you inverted the natural relationship. The OP's question was whether wanting children is an instinct or a social construct. It cannot have been a purely social construct because wanting children had to come before society even developed. Any prehistoric person who did not want children could simply chose not to procreate and therefore not pass on his/her genes.   At the beginning, the instinct must have been to ""want"" children. It wouldn't make sense to just ""want"" sex in the beginning, since the very first humans couldn't have known that sex led to children. Once they did have sex and it did lead to children, they figured out that sex means children and from that point on, the biological instinct could have transferred into wanting sex instead of wanting children. (We do see this kind of transferring onto a totem many times in biology, especially in mate selection). So sexual excitation came into being. But in the beginning, the biological necessity was for children, not for sex.   So now let me return to the present. Now let's say modern people want sex because through evolution, it turns them on, and do not necessary want children. People who don't want children use protective measures if possible to prevent having children. If they never want children at any point in their lives, then it is very realistic to never actually have children - especially in the modern world of birth control and condoms. Therefore, according to the same evolutionary argument, anybody with the ""do not want children"" gene would not pass on those genes and the gene would very quickly die out.   You could then make the argument, what about people who don't have access to birth control and/or condoms? Well, then those people are stuck with children that they did not want to begin with. Conceivably, those parents would invest less in their offspring and more in themselves, as they were inclined to do anyway. That is, if they didn't want to invest in any offspring to begin with, there's no reason to believe they will suddenly invest a lot in their unwanted offspring once the latter are born. Therefore, the offspring of these parents would be less well-off compared to offspring of parents who did want children and therefore invested a lot in their kids. The latter group of children would therefore out-compete the former group and come to dominate in the population."

By that logic, shouldn't it be the other way around? They could not have wanted children and had sex as a result as they did not know that having sex led to children. Therefore initially they must have wanted sexual intercourse and then discovered that it leads to children."

Any human who did not want to procreate never passed on his or her genes. They must have tried a lot of different ways to procreate and figured out sex. Then the biological drive transferred to sex.   You can't say that they wanted sex first because it wouldn't make biological sense. There is no biological imperative to have sex just for the sake of having sex. There is only a biological imperative to survive and reproduce. Any gene that helps those two things is passed on and dominates."

You have to remember that the only biological imperatives are to survive and to reproduce. Anything else has no biological basis. Therefore, sex has no biological basis if not tied to reproduction.

If you really meant it this way, that would mean you are a creationist.  I would say, that we are the products of organisms, which ""wanted"" to reproduce (maybe wanting is also not very clean since this lifeforms could have been really simple). To increase the diversity of the offspring sex evolved and since then is used by various organisms as the single method of reproduction. For this organisms the link of both is so strong, that you only necessarily need one instict to procreate. Hence the population should consist of individuals, who have one of these instincts or both.  I assume at least in the past the number of children of an individual should be smaller, if it sees sex as a nasty chore, which would explain, why the majority of people has a sex drive and wants sex regularly. So only wanting children should be a minority trait. The majority of the population should consist of people, who have either only the instinct for sex or both.   The modern methods of contraceptions should strongly select against the only wanting sex type, which would lead to the majority being both, while the only wanting children types share increases."

This is not necessarily the very first humans of our species but could be very early human ancestors. The point is that wanting to reproduce had to come before wanting sex, not the other way around. Only after the two became intertwined did the desire shift to sex. All this likely occurred even before the evolution of sexual reproduction and therefore the desire for children/offspring was satisfied in other ways. But the key is that the desire for offspring is fundamental and could not have been social because human society did not evolve for billions of years.   Otherwise, I agree with your analysis of selection with one minor point. I don't think anyone can prove or disprove that the basic instinct for reproduction ever went away. It was shifted onto sex, sure, but the primal instinct is likely still there. We see this a lot in neuroscience and behavior, where fundamental instincts, although since shifted onto other things, still manifest themselves during extreme circumstances."

What makes leafy greens healthy to eat is not the calories, but the vitamins and minerals they contain. Particularly vitamins A, C, and K, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. All leaves will have these since they're indispensable parts of photosynthesis and cellular function for the plant.  The greens we eat have been bred for generations to have thinner cell walls, which means a higher nutrient-to-weight ratio, and also less of things like oxalates, tannins, and other metabolites that make them unpalatable, toxic, or even lock up the nutrients so that we can't digest them.  This would be the main problem, particularly with trees, which often have thickened leaves and a lot of secondary metabolites. They produce these things precisely to prevent animals from eating them. You'd be better off eating the leaves of herbaceous (non-woody) plants.

Gamma rays typically have more than enough energy to excite atomic electrons. They have enough energy to ionize atoms (kick electrons out of their bound states) or even excite/break apart atomic nuclei.  The energy loss of high energy photons through matter is dominated by three processes: the photoelectric effect (kicking electrons out of their bound states), Compton scattering (scattering of photons off of electrons or nuclei), and pair production (a gamma ray moving through matter with enough energy can produce and electron/positron pair).

The binding energy of an electron is typically on the order of electronvolts (eV), and the energies of typical gamma rays are on the order of megaelectronvolts (MeV), a million times higher. So the photon can kick the electron out and go about its business as if nothing even happened to it.

Are you visualizing the atom absorbing the gamma ray and re-emitting it? Because that's not a good way to think about it. The energy of a gamma ray is typically much larger than the atomic binding energy of the atom.

But for high-energy gammas the rate of photoelectric interactions is very low.  What you say can be true sometimes for Compton scattering, but even so it can take a lot of shielding to get most high-energy gamma rays to undergo any Compton event.

askscience,3dqn0a,sticklebat,0,Sun Jul 19 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"The answer given by /u/RobusEtCeleritas is not a good answer, although it naively sounds like it makes sense. The reason why glass is transparent to gamma rays is not primarily because it takes a lot of interactions to absorb its energy, but because gamma rays tend to not interact frequently with the material.  For example, any photon (gamma ray or not) that frees electrons via the photoelectric effect will be completely absorbed, with all of the photon's energy being transferred to the electron (any energy above the binding energy will simply result in an electron with greater kinetic energy). If this occurred just as frequently for gamma rays in glass as it does for UV rays, then gamma rays would be absorbed just as well.  The best explanation that I can think of that doesn't rely heavily on advanced physics and math is related to the effective 'size' of a gamma ray. The wavelength of light is very loosely analogous to its size (or its interaction cross-section). The wavelength of UV light is between roughly 1 to 100 nm, which is very large by atomic standards (atoms are about 0.1 to 0.5 nm in diameter). The spacing of atoms in glass and in most materials is also much smaller than the wavelength of a typical UV ray, and so the UV photon is very likely to interact with it.  The longest wavelength gamma rays are about 1000 times smaller than the shortest wavelength of UV rays, and much smaller than atoms and the atomic separation in a material. They are much more likely to pass through it then without really noticing the matter they're traveling through.  A crude analogy is throwing basketballs and ping pong balls through the poles of a fence, where the poles represent the atoms of a material and the balls are UV and gamma rays, respectively. The larger basketballs are much more likely to hit the poles, whereas most of the ping pong balls will go between them completely undisturbed."

askscience,3dpd0p,dypo,7,Sat Jul 18 04:03:56 2015 UTC,The source of an earthquake is not a dot It is an area where rocks move past each other.

In the case of the San Andreas we have the movement of two plates which causes this build up. When it finally snaps it usually is the area with the strongest structures that hold on longest as you would expect, these are the areas where we see the earthquakes form. The movement can take place along the whole of the fault, but the epicenter and in turn the Hypocenter tend to be located at either 1 or more specific areas rather than along the entire faultline. If you think about it, an earthquake is a release of the earths stored energy, the greater the area that releases this energy, the less of a large scale event you will see. This is why when we talk about large scale earthquakes we typically see one distinct quake and epicenter for that quake along with a massive release of energy from that one area."
askscience,3dpd0p,Orange_Tang,3,Sun Jul 19 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"The fault motion is not a ""line"".  That's the surface expression, but a fault is a 3D plane.  The displacement on either side of a fault plane can be over a wide area (hundreds of km), but the motion begins in a small area where the rock first fails, and then spreads across the fault plane over a period of minutes.  When the fault motion is studied, seismologists plot the point in 3D space where the fault initiated (the focus or hypocentre), and project that point to the surface (the epicentre), but there is much more to it.  A fault plane displacement map such as this one shows the displacement over the fault plane area.  The seismic waves, which are basically sound, spread from the surface of the fault as a complicated 3-dimensional wave front, as if rather than throwing a pebble in a pond, you threw in an object with a more complicated shape.  At some distance, it will still look like a rather spheroidal shape with the focus at the centre, but closer up it will be very complicated interfering wave fronts.  By the time you get hundreds of km away it gets further complicated by the fact that the Earth is not homogeneous material, which affects the way the wave propagates (i.e. varying velocities and densities).  What you experience at the surface is the intersection or interference between the 3D wavefronts moving through the volume of the rock (called body waves) and the waves that form on the surface from them (surface waves).  These would relate to the linear trace of the fault on the surface somehow, but it really depends on the 3D shape of the fault whether that shape of the affected area would correspond closely (e.g., a vertical fault) or only vaguely (e.g., a shallowly-dipping fault).  It would also be affected by the velocities and densities of all the intervening rocks, which means deeper quakes have less resemblance to surface features than shallow ones.  In fact, some major faults don't even make it to the surface and still generate major earthquakes, or their surface expression can be hundreds of km away from where the earthquake is triggered and impinges on the surface directly above.  The former is the case for the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake which was from a thrust fault that doesn't reach the surface.  This page shows quite a bit of detail about that event, including maps of the fault plane displacement and how it propagated along the fault plane over time.  In an area with substantial instrumentation (like California), it's pretty amazing how much detail can be mapped, and that page only scratches the surface."

If you're very near the fault, you would indeed see it spreading across the fault in a 'line'. This is certainly what physically happens. But, if you're standing very far away, you can treat the energy released by an Earthquake as emanating from a single point (the 'hypocenter'), with an energy radiation pattern that captures the orientation of the fault. This radiation pattern is called a 'moment tensor solution': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_mechanism  Here's a simulation done by one of my colleagues that shows an earthquake propagating through Southern California: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Xr0FwRl-Y. Notice how near the fault, you can definitely see the source move in a 'line'. But, if you look at the waves propagating to the edges of the box, you may be able to convince yourself that a decent approximation may be achieved by placing the energy at a single location, and giving it a radiation pattern that is not equal in all directions.   It's similar to dropping a oddly shaped rock into the water. Right at the point of impact, you'll have a fairly complex pattern of waves. But if you wait a few seconds the waves will more-or-less look like they've been generated at a single point."

askscience,3dpd0p,OrbitalPete,5,Mon Jul 20 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"This is a great question. A great way to visualize the earthquake is imagining that there is a massive explosion and the energy wave is spreading out in all directions. The initial wavelet would be spherical, but seismic waves will travel at different speeds through different materials, and even refract and reflect through different layers (snell's law etc). Because the earthquake would occur on a fault line, it would affect the amount of time it will take for the seismic wave to reach the surface in California, but geometry of the wavefront is dependent on the surrounding medium. An example of this would be the fact that the water above the Fault doesn't allow S-waves, whereby surrounding rock allows P-waves. A nice visualization of this compression waves (p-waves) in earthquakes can be seen here. If you want to know more about earthquakes, send me a pm. I've done some research on deep seismology."

askscience,3dqj7l,arkonum,13,Sat Jul 18 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"There are actually multiple kinds of viruses that are currently being researched for their use in oncolytic virotherapy. These include, but are not limited to herpesviruses, poxviruses, rhabdoviruses, polioviruses, morbilliviruses, and reoviruses. These all function on the basis of genetically engineering them to preferentially infect or replicate in tumor cells, as opposed to healthy body tissue.  To answer your question however, herpesviruses are large (approximately 152 kbp in length), doublestranded DNA viruses that infect cells and replicate in the nucleus of infected cells. Like poxviruses, they also have staged transcriptional regulation, containing genes that are expressed either immediate-early, early, or late. This is generally accomplished by each set of timed genes encoding transcription factors that will start of transcription of the next set of genes. Late genes encode transcription factors for immediate-early genes, which will be packaged into progeny virus.  Herpesviruses can replicate in different cell types, but they are very neurotropic (meaning they can infect and replicate in neurons). Oncolytic herpesviruses are generally based on the idea that you can delete a particular gene - ICP34.5 - which mediates virulence in healthy neurons by allowing the virus to overcome an innate cellular mechanism which would normally restrict viral replication, known as PKR. Because cancer cells often have an accumulation of mutations in pathways which would normally provide defenses against viruses, PKR-mediated restriction of viral infection is much weaker, and as a consequence herpesviruses preferentially target these cells.  The strain HSV1716 (based on HSV-1) has ICP34.5 deleted, and has a number of variant strains, including one which encodes the gene NTR (meaning nitroreductase) - which reduces the prodrug CB1954 into a cytotoxic agent, only in HSV1716NTR-infected cells. Additionally, another variant of HSV1716 expresses a noradrenaline transporter to deliver radioactive iodine into cells expressing this protein (infected cells only), to preferentially kill them. In this approach however, normal tissue in the surrounding area could sustain some radiation damage.  Those are just a couple of the variants that are being researched (admittedly I'm not a herpesvirus researcher, though I know a thing or two about virotherapy), and as I mentioned before, there are also other viruses that are being looked at to preferentially target and kill tumor cells, with equally innovative and well-targeted approaches.

A ""field"" is really just a property that has a value at every point in space. The electric field and magnetic fields are both vector fields, that is they have a direction and magnitude (i.e. a vector) for every single point in space.  When we say that charged particles produce the field, it's a rhetorical shorthand. The field is always there, but charged particles make it have interesting configurations. For example, the electric field points away from positively charged particles, and towards negatively charged ones. Or the magnetic field goes in circles around moving charges.  It's also a fact that changes in one field over time cause changes in another the field over time. For example; if you move a magnet, you change the configuration of the magnetic field. This causes a change in the local electric field, too. Electric generators work on this principle. You push a magnet through a loop of wire, and it creates an electric field around the loop that pushes charges into motion, creating a current.  Because changing electric fields cause changing magnetic fields, which cause changing electric fields, if you cause the exact right change in an electric or magnetic field, you can make this ripple of change pass through space with no charges around at all; that's what light is. An electric wave causes a magnetic wave that reinforces the electric wave.  You can actually use the governing equations of the electromagnetic fields (the Maxwell equations) to show that such waves exist, and the speed they'd have to travel at, which is the speed of light."

To differentiate between 3 values you need 2 comparators because there are at least two thresholds. But with 2 comparators you can also process 2 bits.   So binary is the best solution if the comparators are the main cost factor (e.g. inside a CPU). For other task e.g. flash memory a muli-level logic is better because the number of  memory cells is much higher than the number of comparators.
askscience,3ds1oa,Syrak,4,Mon Jul 20 12:41:07 2015 UTC,"Mostly convenience, because it is really easy to design circuits that produce ""on"" and ""off"" by flipping voltage-controlled switches (the transistors in a microchip act like switches).  Because we use a two-state system, we use binary to represent values, because that is how they are stored.  Binary circuits are also a lot smaller and cheaper than circuits for other bases, but we can set that aside to look at a computational reason.  The fundamental limit on the base that can be used for computation is electrical noise.  A computer has to store a k-ary value between the two power rails, which are ground (0 volts) and Vdd (the supply voltage, which is as low as .9 volts in high-performance systems, and up to 3.3 or 5 volts elsewhere).  Additionally, if you are okay with more error on the computation, you can use a higher base and trade it for reduced accuracy.  If you have a possible range of 100 different values between 0 and 1 volt, a 10 mV noise source can affect the result of a computation, while for a binary system, you need 500 mV of electrical noise to flip a bit.  For reference, the power circuits used in most high-performance digital systems tend to have around +/-20 mV of average noise.  You might think that you can use a base 20 system here, leaving a comfortable 50 mV range for each bit (you are an engineer, so you leave some margin around the 40 mV range specified by the average noise), but there are going to be times when the system noise is above average, and you may get computation errors during those times.   As a final note, some high-speed communication systems use a type of signaling called PAM-4 (an eye diagram showing a PAM-4 link is here), where four levels are used for the communication instead of two, and two bits are sent at a time.  These communication channels are less noise-resistant than channels where one bit is sent at a time, but they get higher bit rates without increasing operating frequency."

Here's the book I sourced most of this info from.       In the Light of Evolution: Volume VI: Brain and Behavior ( 2013 ) / Part I: EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS OF NEURONS AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS  A quick synopsis is that in the Porifera there is no synapse, and no neuron at all. But surprisingly, it turns out there are all of the necessary genes to create a synapse. And, all of those genes are being used in other kinds of cell signalling.      This complex of genes used in cell signalling is now known as a proto-synapse and what's meant by that is that all of the right signalling genes were in place, but lacked any kind of global regulation. So all of the ingredients for a synapse were there, but the organization wasn't.       That worked because all of the machinery was itself used in various signalling pathways, just without the actual synapse regulating and coordinating everything. Cells all have an ability to communicate with one another, synapses just stream-line the process in your nervous system where it's most important to have quick and efficient communication.       So the complex of signalling genes called 'proto-synapses' already  functioned in cell signalling, they just weren't organized.      Sponges have all of the right genes to make synapses, but they don't all work together like they would to form a synapse. Ref        In the earliest branching animal phyla (Porifera), in which a nearly complete set of synaptic genes exists in the absence of morphological synapses, these “protosynaptic” genes displayed a lack of global coregulation although small modules of coexpressed genes are readily detectable by using network analysis techniques. These findings suggest that functional synapses evolved by exapting preexisting cellular machines, likely through some modification of regulatory circuitry   They do seem to have a sensory capacity using non-motile cilia.       But it looks like the early 'protosynapse' is made up of proteins that were used for different functions -- cell signaling, for instance.        They were later exapted and used to form the complex cell signalling that we call synapses.       So:        how did those protosynaptic parts increase the fitness of the organism?      By giving the cells the ability to communicate with one another, including a primitive sensory system.         Did they already have other functions in the cell?       It would seem that they did have different functions before they were co-opted to make a neuronal synapses.       Here's a blog that discusses the evolution of protosynaptic machinery and how it was co-opted.     So as far back as the sponges there were already all of the genes necessary for a synapse, and they were functioning in cell signalling. But they were doing it independently. The evolution of the synapse was really just collecting all of these pre-existing mechanisms and putting them together in an organized structure."

askscience,3dpfno,rocketsocks,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:02:56 2015 UTC,"No, conductivity is due to metallic bonds.  In a crystalline solid, for example, most electrons are bound to individual atoms with a few electrons per atom in a bond shared between two atoms. This means that electrons can't move around much since they are localized to only a very small number of atoms.  Metals are very different. The electrons in a metallic bond are promiscuous, they can easily move between one metallic bond between two atoms and another metallic bond. The result is that instead of being like a tinker toy set made out of individual connections a metal is bonded together more like a pudding. There is a vast sea of electrons that make up one huge bond that keeps everything together. This enables tremendous electron mobility since it means that an electron on one side of a little piece of metal could travel all the way to the other side. Electric currents occur when there is a difference in potential energies in the electrons (sort of like applying a pressure in a water system).  In gas form there are no metallic bonds so metallic conductivity doesn't apply."
askscience,3dpfno,gocsick,7,Sat Jul 18 12:08:26 2015 UTC,"You are correct that Cu gas won't be conductive, however you have a lot of errors in your answer.  1) Cu and all pure metals are crystalline. Cu has a face centered cubic crystal structure. Metals are not like a pudding, they are very ordered, however the electrons are delocalized and have high mobility.  2) I think by crystalline you meant ionic bonding, such as salt NaCl. Ionic solids are generally bad conductors, but the better explanation is because the ions are localized and cannot move. Salt is a great conductor in the molten state.  3) Covalent bonded solids can also be crystalline (diamond, graphite) or amorphous (window glass). The conductivity will depend completely on the type of bonding. For example diamond is crystalline and the carbon atoms are SP3-hybridized so they each make 4  strong covalent bonds with other carbon atoms. graphite is also crystalline with the (Hexagonal dihexagonal)[http://webmineral.com/crystal/Hexagonal-DihexagonalDipyramidal.shtml#.VapODovDrwM] crystal structure. It however is SP2 hybridized and is a good conductor because of electron delocalization in each carbon layer."

So if the ice is floating in the water, the force of gravity on the ice must equal the buoyant force.  So if V is the total volume and v is the submerged volume, we get   ρwatervg = ρiceVg   Cancel the g and rearrange to get   v/V = pice/pwater   So the percentage of the entire volume that is submerged is the same as the ratio of the density of ice to water.

askscience,3dm6vs,AskScienceModerator,56,Fri Jul 17 12:00:13 2015 UTC,"What kind of processes interplay with climate and mountain building?  And as far as mountainbuilding goes, which is more significant as a shortening and uplift process - folding or faulting? Does it vary much by lithology or is it largely depth controlled?"
askscience,3dm6vs,OrbitalPete,41,Fri Jul 17 12:17:35 2015 UTC,"What kind of processes interplay with climate and mountain building?   The potential that climate (and more specifically, localized erosion related to similar localizations of precipitation) can influence the location of major structures (e.g. faults) has been one of the driving factors for a lot of tectonics research for the last few decades. The general idea is that if you localize erosion in a particular area of a mountain range that this will drive increased rates of tectonic uplift in this region. Many of the original ideas for this came from models that treated mountain ranges as continuums (basically finite element models that lacked discrete faults). In these types of models, if you induce zones of high rates of erosion, you will see higher rates of deformation and uplift.  In actual mountains, there are a couple of ways you can get localizations of precipitation. The most common is through orographic effects. Basically, when a moisture laden cloud encounters topography, it attempts to go over the topography, which causes most of the moisture to be removed from the cloud in the form of precipitation. This is why you often see wet and dry sides of mountain ranges on the windward and leeward sides, respectively. The prediction would be that the wetter sides will be eroding faster, which in turn will localize more deformation (folding, faulting, etc) on the wetside. This may also change the shape of the mountain range, as rivers on the wetside will be more efficient and shift the drainage divide towards the dry side (basically eating away at the dry sides rivers because they don't have the water to keep up). This seems to work in a couple of places, the southern Alps in New Zealand, the Olympic mountains in western North America, and Taiwan, all have been argued to be examples of places where climatically coupled erosion have influenced the deformation.   But, in lots of other places, when we've tried to test the predictions of these models, we don't find a good correlation between the rate at which rocks are uplifting and climate/precipitation. Basically, the counter argument is that climate and amounts of precipitation will influence the way the topography responds to uplift, but that at the end of the day, tectonics (e.g. the rate of convergence between plates, geometry of faults, etc) is really the driver behind uplift rates and the evolution of a mountain range.   And as far as mountainbuilding goes, which is more significant as a shortening and uplift process - folding or faulting? Does it vary much by lithology or is it largely depth controlled?   You often don't get one without the other. There are places where it seems there has been primarily folding (basically large scale buckling of the crust), but it is more common that folds are manifestations of movement on faults. In general, I would say faulting is more significant in terms of accommodating both shortening and uplift and that the ratios between shortening and uplift will be a combination of the rates and the geometries (i.e. steeper faults equal more uplift and less shortening and shallow faults equal lots of shortening without as much uplift). Styles of faulting and folding are very sensitive to the types of rocks (this is often referred to as ""mechanical stratigraphy""). Sedimentary rocks with lots of bedding planes are more likely to form ""thin-skinned"" fold-thrust belts, where as stronger rocks (e.g. granite) might be more likely to form ""thick-skinned"" styles of deformation, with lots of larger, deeper, and more high angle structures."
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,11,Fri Jul 17 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say, my favorite connection between climate and mountain building is the uplift-weathering hypothesis wherein uplift of the Himalayas led to increased chemical weathering and a continuous long-term decrease in atmospheric CO2. And this would seem to generate a positive feedback along the lines of what you first suggest, where increased erosion and weathering would accelerate the uplift as well."
askscience,3dm6vs,Ocean_Chemist,13,Fri Jul 17 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"How can one determine the age of a mountain? Do you take a sample from its surface, date it and postulate that the mountain is as old as its uppermost layers? Or is the idea of the age of a mountain different from that and might require a more intricate method?  Besides, I heard recently that climate change increases erosion on mountains and boulders, when frozen water in tiny cracks gets warm enough to melt and expand, thus creating even bigger cracks. This even led to such big changes, that famous postcard picture ranges now look quite different from what they once were. Are there also other ways climate changes affects mountain erosion?"
askscience,3dm6vs,jaZoo,17,Fri Jul 17 12:48:39 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what the question you're interested in. Mountain building, as a process, takes tens to hundreds of millions of years and mountain ranges are massive things, spanning thousands to millions of square kilometers. Questions people are often interested for a particular mountain range might be, ""when did mountain building begin?"", ""when did this particular fault system become active?"", or ""when did deformation of this mountain range stop or slow down significantly?""   To get at the age of mountains or the processes that produce them, I would say there are two broad approaches. One would be looking at the deposits formed as a result of the growth and erosion of mountain ranges. In the depositional record deposited in foreland basins, which is a term specifically for a basin developed next to a mountain range, we often see a transition from rocks that we would generally describe as ""flysch"" to rocks we call ""molasse"". Generally, flysch is fine grained material (mudstones, siltstones, fine grained sandstones, etc) deposited in a marine or near marine environment and are interpreted to predate mountain building. Molasses is coarser material (sandstones, conglomerates, etc) that is interpreted as the material eroded from the growing mountain range. If you can date the timing of this transition between flysch and molasse, you can get at the approximate age of initiation of mountain building (common ways of dating would be through things like magnetostratigraphy or radiometric dating of interbedded volcanic deposits). Further details in the stratigraphy can also tell you about changes in the mountain range, e.g. initiation of new fault systems, changes in climate that might be induced by growing topography, etc.   An additional way we establish timing of various aspects of mountain building is by direct dating of rocks within the mountain range. Much of this falls under the auspices of techniques described as thermochronology. Thermochronology functions on the basis that different geochronologic systems in different minerals become closed systems (i.e. start accumulating daughter products) at different temperatures. If you date a bunch of these minerals with different systems in the same rock, you can define a cooling rate (and changes in that cooling rate) through time. Do that in a bunch of places in a mountain range and you can start to define when different parts of the mountain range started to be uplifted faster than previously, what those rates are, and how those rates may have changed with time. For the interested, this is a nice review paper of using thermochronology to understand orogenic (mountain range) evolution."

You divide the rock into pieces - the parts that are flysch from molasse.  Out of the molasse, you get volcanic bits.  First you see which way the rock thinks is North.  You see if it has uranium and how degraded the uranium is.  That tells you when the rock came out of the inside.  Also, you look at different compounds.  You say, I have so much of parent A, so much of daughters A1, A2, A3, so much of parent B, etc - then you can say what?  That rock has been a certain temperature at some point in the past?  How can you define a cooling RATE that way?  There are ice ages, and erosion, tectonic drift to cooler or warmer parts of the planet, never mind what the sun was doing during all those years, bombarding the compounds with radiation at varying depths.  How do you decide what is important and what can be disregarded in your modeling?  How well can you apply models from mountain to mountain?  How important is atmosphere and climate in aging rocks that are not exposed to the air, or water?  When you end up graphing the cooling rate is it smooth or all jagged?  Is it logarithmic?

What is your opinion on the timing of the uplift?  Bonus question: What is your opinion about the reaction of the Georgian double-foreland between the Lesser/ Greater Caucasus? When you have two encroaching orogens that are facing each-other, you would expect to have two foredeeps, but what happens with the forebulge interaction?

askscience,3dm6vs,GeoManCam,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"There are kind of two camps developing in terms of timing of uplift. The Vincent et al camp is arguing for older uplift (Oligo-Miocene) and my/our camp is arguing for much younger initiation of the main orogenic phase, basically 5 ma. This is based mostly on other thermochronology data, from Avdeev and Niemi and in some other data in Avdeev's PhD thesis that hasn't yet made it into a journal article (unfortunately Boris died shortly after completing his PhD). These results together suggest synchronous and rapid exhumation that started in both the western/central part of the range and the extreme eastern part of the range. They/us/I have interpreted the timing of that exhumation as being indicative of the collision between the Lesser Caucasus crust and the Greater Caucasus crust. There are a lot of questions that remain as to which group is ""right"" or whether there is some sort of middle ground solution. We know there are fundamental differences in the crustal and deeper structure between the western (where all of Vincent's data is) and the central and eastern Greater Caucasus, so it's possible there are differences in timing and the nature of the orogenic process. This is the focus of lots of ongoing work/publications from myself and colleagues, and likely Vincent and colleagues too.   Oooh bonus question! Yeah, this is SUPER interesting and has been the motivation for a lot of my work going forward. I've argued that the nascent collision between the Lesser and Greater Caucasus may be driving some large scale structural reorganization within the Greater Caucasus, but elaborating on that requires better dating and better characterization of geometries of structures (working on the proposal now...). The question of what might have happened earlier on when you still had two forebulges that might have interacted is also interesting, you might still have that more so in the eastern Greater Caucasus, in Azerbaijan. The basin geometries in the Kura Basin is odd and I've always wondered how much of that might be from some sort of interaction between the flexural response to the Greater Caucasus, Lesser Caucasus and whatever is happening with the South Caspian-Kura basin interface."

Being able to perfectly predict earthquakes would require a complete model of every fault including its location and geometry at depth (which we don't have and likely never will), being able to quantify the mechanical properties along all of these fault planes (also, which we don't have and probably never will), being able to quantify the amount of strain on all parts of all faults (again, we don't have and likely never will), and having a complete record of all past events (you can probably guess the answer here too). Earthquake prediction in the sense of ""there will be a magnitude 5.3 at this location at this time"" is unrealistic given the complexity of the systems involved. Our best bets are earthquake forecasting, so more like weather forecasts, probabilities of an event happening in a rough area over some time frame, and early warning systems, integrated networks of sensors which detect the P-waves of an earthquake and provide short term warning before the more destructive surface waves hit an area.

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,4,Fri Jul 17 20:24:12 2015 UTC,"There are actually a fair number of mountainous areas that have experienced a few different ""orogenic events"". Where I do a lot of my work, the Caucasus are a current mountain range due to the collision between the Arabian and Eurasian plates in the last 15 or so million years, but there are exposures of older crust in parts of the mountain range that were originally deformed during the Variscan orogeny, which was part of a large mountain building event during the formation of Pangea, that also deformed much of the east coast of North America. This event spanned nearly 100 million years, from 380-280 million years ago, though most of the ages of rocks associated with this in the Caucasus area around 320 million years old. The Appalachians on the east coast are also another example of an area deformed in several mountain building events. They were deformed in this same event (though in the Appalachians, it's called the Alleghenian orogeny and occurred about 325-260 million years ago), but had been previously deformed in the Acadian orogeny ~375 million years ago and the Taconic orogeny, around 440 million years ago.   The tendency for mountain building events to happen multiple times in roughly the same place is largely an expression of the supercontinent, or wilson, cycle. Independent of supercontinent formation, there is also the tendency for an area to experience multiple mountain building events when a continental margin is bordered by an active subduction zone. In this setting, you expect to have multiple mountain building events as volcanic arcs (like Japan today) are smashed into the margin of the continent."

For GIS, I primarily use ArcGIS but am increasingly relying on Matlab and R for doing more statistical analysis of topography.  For the modeling aspect, there are a couple of broad classes of models. There are models geared primarily for 1) modeling the deformation of the earth's crust, 2) modeling erosional processes, and 3) models which attempt to integrate these two. As you might expect, the models either focused exclusively on modeling deformation or erosion generally do a better job at modeling either deformation or erosion than the ones that try to do both. The class of models that try to do both also have some pretty big issues (they tend to model deformation in a way that might be appropriate on very long time scales, but don't really represent what we see at any given time in the geologic record), but are important for getting at potential coupling between deformational and erosional processes.  For my own work, I've primarily worked with the models that are focused on erosion. These are often called ""landscape evolution models"" and I've worked with a couple of different ones. I am primarily a model user as opposed to builder, but I every once and a while need to tinker with something or understand enough of the model function to interpret outputs, which has required learning bits and pieces of fortran and C++, depending on the model I'm using. I do a lot of sort of programming, writing scripts to process and interpret outputs of these models, which is primarily done in Matlab."

I have visited the glaciers and hotsprings and I have admired the way the mountains formed.  A few questions have popped in to my mind over the years and would love to hear your input.   As a glacier melts the water will, over time, create a river which will slowly wear out the earth and cause the mountain to be more susceptible to slides.  Meanwhile, other natural forces cause wear from the top down, also resulting in slides.   My question is which of these erode the mountain faster. Did the large shale areas on most ranges form prior to growth, during growth, or years later after the range formed? Also, does shale continue to form or does it harden over time? How much significance does shale have in the erosion of a mountain? Have you ever visited Franks Slide?"

As a glacier melts the water will, over time, create a river which will slowly wear out the earth and cause the mountain to be more susceptible to slides. Meanwhile, other natural forces cause wear from the top down, also resulting in slides. My question is which of these erode the mountain faster.   Glaciers can be extremely efficient erosional agents, which has led to the idea that glaciers can effectively limit the height of mountain ranges, in a hypothesis often referred to as the 'glacial buzzsaw', e.g. this paper, but there are many others discussing this idea as well. In areas without much glaciation, it's been long assumed that erosion by rivers are basically the dominant process for balancing uplift from tectonic forces, but increasingly there has been suggestions that erosion from mass wasting events (i.e. landslides and the like) may play a larger role than previously thought. Some of the argument about the landslide vs rivers debate gets a little circular (is it the landslide doing the work or the river because you needed the river to create the differential between the peaks and the valleys before you were able to have a landslide and still need the river to remove the material from the landslide, etc etc). The TL;DR would be if you have glaciers, they probably win the erosion battle. After that probably rivers, maybe landslides, if you're talking about shorter (1,000-10,000 year) timescales.   Did the large shale areas on most ranges form prior to growth, during growth, or years later after the range formed? Also, does shale continue to form or does it harden over time? How much significance does shale have in the erosion of a mountain?    Not 100% sure what you're asking, but assuming you're talking about shale, the rock, e.g. shale, then this rock basically represents deposits of mud. Mud is usually deposited in relatively ""quiet"" water environments (think deep ocean, lakes, etc) so these deposits of shale and slate (the lightly metamorphosed version of shale) usually represent a basin that formed before mountain building which was progressively closed through subduction or underthrusting to form the mountain range.

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an interesting question, but sadly not one I have too many thoughts on. I've mostly thought about the inverse of this question, specifically how rifted margins, extended basins, etc may influence the location and structural style of mountains that form when these extended regions are compressed. From the extensive history of areas that have experienced multiple extension and compressional episodes (a theme that has come up several times in this AMA in fact) we know that previous episodes of extension or compression seem to make the converse ""easier"" at a later time. This makes sense to a certain extent, because of the nature of faults and friction, it is easier to deform a region that is already fractured than intact crust. At larger scales, there is also likely some important thermal effects (i.e. thermal weakening of deformed zones, etc). I tend to try to approach problems like this from the mindset of the mechanical strength of the crust and the things that influence said strength. Perhaps one of the most useful (but LONG) reads on this subject is this review paper from a few years ago. I find myself referring back to it quite frequently, though I often can't bring myself to read the whole thing everytime!"
askscience,3dm6vs,writersblocquebecois,3,Fri Jul 17 14:07:22 2015 UTC,Can you describe the process of mapping the distribution of rocks and faults?
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,3,Sat Jul 18 01:02:29 2015 UTC,"I can try, but we teach whole courses on this and mostly we teach these in the field because it's hard to describe! In simple terms, it's a lot of hiking, but with purpose. The first step in mapping (at least assuming your making the map on your own, as opposed to in an exercise) is to define the ""stratigraphy"", basically what are the different rock units you are going to be mapping. This might seem simple, but it's actually pretty complicated and depends on the question you are trying to answer. If you care about lots of really naunced changes in rock type and fine scale variation, then you may break out lots of different units (e.g. medium grained yellowish sand unit, cross-bedded red sand unit, interbedded sand and silt unit, etc etc), but if your purpose is to cover a lot of ground and map major structures (faults, folds) you probably don't need that much detail and could just lump those all into ""sand unit"".   Once you've defined a stratigraphy (which you have to do iteratively, i.e. you have to start mapping to define your stratigraphy) you can really start mapping. From there it's basically walking/driving around an area and transferring what you see in the landscape in terms of distributions and orientations of your defined units onto a 2d map. Also, lot harder than it sounds. Seeing things in 3d from ground level and transferring that to a 2d representation of topography viewed from above is not easy, requires a lot of 3d visualization skills and years of practice.   Within mapping contacts between units, there will also likely be structures (faults, folds) that you need to map (if there is no deformation, it's going to be a real boring map, at least from the perspective of a structural geologist). Again, a lot of this is transferring what you see in the landscape onto the map, but often there will need to be interpolation, which requires understanding from a theoretical perspective how rocks deform, i.e. what is reasonable or physically possible. Basically trying to undeform the rocks in your head to figure out how to draw them on the map and then in cross section view.   Basically repeat the above process until you've filled your map or run out of time and money."

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Sat Jul 18 01:13:16 2015 UTC,"Short answer, we have no idea.  Longer answer, determining the past height of mountain ranges is difficult and the techniques for doing so 1) often give you pretty big error bars (e.g. paleoelevation of 2 km +/- 2 km) and 2) require deposits that formed at elevation so limit the techniques basically to areas where you actually get deposition at high elevation (which basically mean big plateaus like you have in the Andes, Himalaya, and to a lesser extent Turkey and Iran) and to mountain ranges that are reasonably young (i.e. even if you had a big plateau that formed, you need to preserve the deposits that formed on that plateau to be able to do get at paleoelevation).   This means that we don't have any robust way of determining paleoelevation in very old orogens (like the Appalachians). Based on our understanding of the limits of the height of mountain ranges, we think that likely mountain ranges (on average) likely have not been too much higher than the Himalaya are today. As for what the limits are on the heights of mountain range, this question pops up on AskScience every few months, so in lieu of writing out a long answer again, I'll just be lazy and link to a previous answer I gave on said subject."

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,4,Sat Jul 18 02:42:39 2015 UTC,"The majority of the geometric data you're asking about is calculated from analysis of digital elevation models (DEMs), which are essentially just interpolated surfaces built from large numbers of of X (longitude), Y (latitude) and Z (elevation) points. The origin of that input X,Y,Z data is pretty broad. A lot of older DEMs were made simply by essentially extracting XYZ points from old topographic maps (for which the input data was often stereo-pairs of photographs from airplanes or old-school ground based surveys). Newer DEM products come from satellite data, some of the common publicly available data are SRTM, which uses radar data to measure XYZ points, and Aster, which in many ways is similar to the old stereo-pair approach, but with satellite imagery. More detailed datasets are being created by the use of LiDAR or new advanced photogrammetric techniques, like Structure from Motion, or SfM.   Your supposition regarding data quality is pretty much spot on. With places in the developed world, it's usually possible to get DEMs with a spatial resolution of a few meters per pixel, and submeter scale resolution if there is LiDAR or if you do your own SfM work, maybe cm to mm scale. For places like where I work, SRTM is still pretty much the best, and this has a resolution of 90 meters (they are in the process of releasing a new global dataset at 30 meter resolution, but the Caucasus are one of the last places for which they have not yet released this data, curses!). Aster DEMs are better resolution (30 meters) but are super noisy so are hard to use for quantitative analysis.  Once you have your DEM, the type of analysis you're describing (measuring local slopes, etc) is usually done in a GIS, or geographic information systems, environment. There are lots of these out there, I use one of the more common ones, ArcGIS.

Currently, the accuracy is between .5 to 2 meter resolution (meaning that you get the average of the data within a 2 meter 'box'  The better the quality/resolution, the more expensive it becomes.

Use your hands: when your hands slide against eachother, friction is made. With subduction, the tips of your fingers also bulge up a little bit. When the lateral force is too much, your hands (the plates) release, causing an earthquake. Because of the release, the bulge is also released, resulting in subsidence. The Oregon coast has many examples of drowned forests from 1700 (the last CSZ quake), where the subsidence of this bulge dropped trees into standing water (specifically some in Sunset Bay). However, this subsidence still isn't very much. Probably on the magnitude of a few feet at  most. The Coast range mountains will probably drop a few inches."

The mountain building seen commonly in western North America is thermal in origin, rather than collisional (as exemplified by the Himalayas). So mountains form from enormous amounts of magma rising from the sinking plate--which here is the Cascades. You will not see new mountains or islands formed as the result of an earthquake at this subduction zone. Though you do see shifts of land upwards or downwards as a result of earthquakes, these are never large enough to be called mountains. This subduction zone is ""spring loaded"" in that there is a lot of friction between two tectonic plates sliding past each other, and there has been a while for friction to build up here without any earthquakes to relieve the tension."

The Rockies have also experienced a long history of deformation, and you will often hear people discuss the ""ancestral Rockies"", which is basically a mountain building event that created a mountain range in the area of the Rockies during the Pennsylvanian (~320-300 million years ago).

askscience,3dm6vs,zynt4x,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:35 2015 UTC,"Throughout my childhood I was under the impression that Mt. Everest had no competition at all, being several kilometres taller than its 'rival mountains'. That being despite the fact that K2 is 'only' a couple of hundred metres lower than Mt. E.  Looking at the 5 or 10 highest mountains, the dispersion does not seem that great regarding height - why is that? Is it impossible to think that mountains could be 10 or even 20 kilometres high? Is there an absolute maximum with earth's geology? Thanks in advance - I am looking forward to read though all of your replies once you get back!"
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"There are several factors that limit the height of a mountain range, copied below are the relevant parts of answer to a similar question a few months back link to comment:   Work Required to Continue Building Topography This is probably the one that gets closest to what is being described in that top comment (""whereby they cause the earth's crust to compress from sheer mass""), but has less to do with isostasy and more to do with work (in the energy sense) involved in building topography. For mountain ranges like the Himalaya that are built through the collision of continents, this collision represents the energy input. At a certain point, the amount of work required to continuing to increase elevations exceeds the input and it is ""easier"" to simply expand the mountain range laterally. For those interested in a technical treatment of this, check out this paper.   Isostasy Isostasy is an important factor, but within that, the really important point is the nature of the lithosphere that the mountain range is sitting on. While thinking of topography on the Earth from a purely isostatic standpoint (i.e. blocks floating in water) works to some extent, the better description is in terms of flexure (i.e. blocks sitting on a taut sheet of elastic). The height of a mountain range (the height of your block measured relative to some reference) will depend on the density and size of the block and the strength, essentially the thickness of the elastic sheet. You could imagine the same exact block having very different heights depending on whether the sheet is very thin (sinks down a lot, block is not very high) or very thick (doesn't sink much, block is much higher). In terms of mountain ranges, this basically depends on the type of material in the mountain range, the shape of that mountain range, and the nature of the lithosphere it forms on. This is largely why Olympus Mons on Mars is as high as it is, not the gravity, but rather because the thickness and the rigidity of the Martian lithosphere is much much greater than Earth's and thus can support larger loads. Coupled with the lack of active tectonics and a fixed source for magma from a hotspot leads to a giant volcano.  Pressure-Temperature Conditions at the Base of a Mountain Range Probably one of the most important aspects for collisional mountain belts, like the Himalaya are the fact that they have reached the height they are by crustal thickening, basically the crust being deformed and stacked on top of itself. Because of the isostatic/flexural response, as the crust thickens, elevations increase but the depths (and thus the pressures and temperatures) that the bottom, or root, of your mountain range is experiencing also increase. At a certain point, the temperature and pressure conditions reach a point where the material making up the mountain range will change into a very dense rock called eclogite. The eclogite will be denser than the mantle rocks against which it is juxtaposed, which is gravitationally unstable, leading to a process called delamination, where this dense elcogitic root detaches and sinks into the mantle. Going back to the isostasy discussion, there is now a reduced thickness of crust which on the long term will lead to a reduction in elevations of the range.  Climate Another huge factor is the effect of climate and erosional processes on the height of mountain ranges. There is a relatively popular idea referred to as the ""glacial buzzsaw"" which predicts (and has been largely born out by data in many of the Earth's active mountain ranges) that mountain ranges generally will not exceed a certain height because of the actions of glaciers, check out this video that describes the ""buzzsaw"" in a simple way. Glaciers are incredibly efficient erosional agents, so once a mountain range reaches heights sufficient to start forming glaciers, the glaciers in turn buzz down the peaks of that range. The height limit imposed by glaciers would obviously depend on latitude (higher latitudes can support glaciers at lower elevations), general climate, and the precipitation patterns in the mountain range (still need precipitation to form glaciers)."

What are some things you would recommend a recent grad to do to get into Quaternary geology, Geomorph & landslides?   With a geology degree, what you do in grad school (if you choose to go) can be completely unrelated to what you did in undergrad, do don't feel locked into paleo (but paleo's cool too). Geomorph, especially as related to landslides and the like, is really moving towards heavy utilization of high resolution topography from LiDAR, Structure from Motion, or the equivalent. Getting familiar with some of these things (i.e. internships, reading, whatever) would certainly help. Geomorphology is also becoming increasingly quantitative, so working on math and programming would be good skills to have for a future in geomorph.   Second, I've noticed that field camp is the most inexact part of my undergrad career. We're drawing contacts based on 1:18000 topo, and fudging cross sections from nearby strikes&dips. Is field work really this inexact?   I did most of my field mapping for my PhD on 1:100,000 scale russian military topo maps that were made in the 1940's to 60's so showed towns and roads that hadn't existed since the fall of the Soviet Union (or before that) and had errors, inserted on purpose, in case the maps fell into the hands of the enemy (or grad students), so trust me, your contacts are laser accurate compared to mine. In all truth, field mapping can be inexact at times, but it all depends on the scale of the questions you're trying to answer. For my work, I was mapping >1000 km2 , that hadn't really ever been mapped before, so hyper accurate contacts were not crucial. In other places, mapping down to sub meter accuracy is incredibly important.    Finally, how do you feel about Paleosols? (Just took paleopedology from THE paleosol guy...who is a little debated)   I don't have a strong opinion on paleosols. They are interesting and can be incredibly useful in reconstructing paleoclimate within stratigraphic sections (i.e. stable isotopes from soil carbonate within paleosols). I wish I had had a class on paleosols as an undergrad, or as a grad student for that matter, would have been quite useful at times."
askscience,3dm6vs,AsAChemicalEngineer,2,Sat Jul 18 01:07:07 2015 UTC,What kind of fossils can you find in the peaks of the Caucasus mountains? Does their presence or absence tell you anything really cool about them?
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I've only been to a few of the peaks, partially because a lot of my work was focused down in the basin next to the mountains, but also because a lot of the peaks are in Russia, and not particularly ""friendly"" parts of Russia (e.g. Chechnya, Dagestan, etc). The main peak I've been to (or near at least) is a volcano, so not much in the way of fossils.  Most of the sedimentary rocks in the Caucasus are Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. Before anyone gets too excited, these were deposited in a marine setting, so probably no dinosaurs (at least not that I know of), but I've seen some pretty cool ammonite fossils. Most of the fossils I've dealt with have been in the basin and have been decidedly less exciting to look at. These are mostly late cenozoic (so 3 million years or younger) in age and are mostly ostracods, which look like really tiny little clam shells (though they're not). These are actually important because depending on which little ostracods are present, can tell us something about the age of the sediments.  In the portions of the stratigraphy that I did a lot of work on that was more terrestrial (i.e. deposited on land), I've found a few cool fossils, like a nice horse tooth, and lots of neat plant fossils including a whole fossilized tree stump! These, and other things, have also been useful in reconstructing the paleoenvironments of these areas, besides being neat to find."

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Since the mountains you study are young, have they not delaminated as of yet? I'm studying Geology at school and we are told that whether a mountain range has delaminated or not is a method for verifying mountain maturity.   Delamination does require a certain amount of time, but it also requires a certain amount of crustal thickening in order for the crustal root of the mountain range to end up deep enough to begin to undergo the metamorphic reactions required to transform it into eclogite. The extent to which delamination is a process that all mountains undergo is an open question, but I would say it's not a particularly robust sign of ""maturity"". Interestingly enough, it has been argued that parts of the Greater Caucasus have experienced a delamination event, e.g. this and this other paper, but myself and colleagues have argued that in detail this was likely not a delamination event, but rather a detachment of a subducted slab. Conservatively, right now data could probably be used to support either hypothesis, so we don't quite know for sure yet.   Did you use graduate school as a method to acquire your research position? I'm unsure of what I want to do after school and have thought of attempting to do research expeditions to try and travel. Is this, in your opinion, a viable path?

Not be too pompous, but mine. This also depends on what part of the range you're more interested in. For the southwestern half (basically the young fold-thrust belt in Azerbaijan and Georgia), I'd recommend this paper or this one. For more range scale neotectonics, I'd suggest this paper or this paper, though I have some issues with the Mosar paper that will be addressed in a new paper of mine that will be (hopefully) coming out in a few weeks in Geosphere (just turned in the final copies of the proofs this morning before I started answering questions in the AMA).   2) Have you looked into paleo-altimetry with Oxygen isotopes for the Caucasus Mountains?   I have not, for a couple of reasons. First, it's not my area of expertise, but more importantly because I'm not aware of any deposits that formed at high elevations that would be suitable for this kind of work. The logistics of working in the higher parts of the range is also worth considering as much of this is in portions of Russia that it's generally not advisable to travel to. The history of elevation changes in the Caucasus are definitely a pretty interesting story that needs a fair bit of work, but I'm not sure paleoelevation work with oxygen istopes would be the most fruitful way to go about it.   3) Is there decent GPS measurement for active uplift,    There is some GPS data from the Caucasus, the most relevant publication is this paper from nearly a decade ago and this update for the stations in the eastern half of the range published more recently.    and if not have you considered using stream profiling for potential active uplift?   Yes, the paper of mine published last year did a fair amount of river profile analysis to try to get at regions of active uplift. The paper mentioned above that will be coming out in Geosphere also makes extensive use of stream profile analysis and other topographic data along with landscape evolution models to explore active deformation in the eastern Greater Caucasus.   4) Do you use your grad students to separate your zircons or measure fission tracks?    I don't have grad students (I'm a postdoc) so I'm still doing all my own separations (woohoo heavy liquids!). I don't really do any thermochronology myself, mainly collaborate with people who do it, but I did a fair amount of detrital zircon geochronology as a part of my dissertation."

I would take most of what Chris Goldfinger says pretty seriously in that article, he has done a vast amount of very careful work in that region and while there are some potentially valid criticisms of the records he's assembled, they are pretty convincing. Some of the statements by the FEMA director quoted in the article seem more for shock value, so might take those with a bit of a grain of salt.  All and all though, it is unfortunately largely accurate in many of its claims and projections. A large magnitude event is guaranteed to happen there, quibbling over exact probabilities aside, it will be incredibly destructive both in terms of casualties and monetary cost, and compared to areas that face similar threats (e.g. Japan) the region is woefully under prepared for such an event."

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:21 2015 UTC,"Most of the modeling I do falls under the classification of a landscape evolution model (LEM). I primarily use two different LEMs, FastScape and CHILD. At their core, these models are solving for the time evolution of topography given various input parameters relating to climate, the properties of the rocks in the landscape, and rates of uplift. They also keep track of the volumes of sediment eroded and deposited. At their core, these types of models are basically just tracking the conservation of mass in an eroding system. There are lots of knobs to twist, especially in CHILD. One of the main things you can control is the way in which fluvial erosion is actually modeled. In simple terms, there are basically three modes, detachment limited, transport limited and a mixed mode between those. In detachment limited systems (which is the numerically the most simple to calculate, and thus the easiest to model), there is always enough capacity of a river to carry the sediment that is eroded from a landscape, so the erosion rate is limited by the rate at which material is ""detached"" from the bedrock. Transport limited systems are instead limited by the capacity of water, i.e. there is always more material detached and produced in situ in a landscape than there is water to move said sediment. The in between (which is the hardest to calculate, so models using this mode take a long time to run) has both happening in different parts of the landscape at different time depending on what is happening upstream of a particular point and what is happening at that point as well. The mixed mode is probably the closest to reality, but because it's so computationally intensive, not a lot of models are done in this mode.  There are so many other knobs to tweak (if you're really interested, just download the user guide for CHILD and start looking through all the different variables you change the values of)."

While essentially the same technology in a handheld GPS, the receivers used for these types of measurements are better and the measurements are done in a specific way. Basically we either permanent GPS stations that are securely mounted somewhere (usually away from people to avoid being tampered with, but still accessible by road for maintenance) and continuously record the movement of the station with respect to the satellite constellation. The other style is so-called ""campaign"" GPS surveys. Here, a permanent monument is installed (basically a marker that is precisely located and firmly affixed to the surface of the earth) and a GPS station is set up periodically (maybe once a year, once every 6 months, etc), measurements are made, and then the position of the station is compared to its previous positions over several years.

It's been an incredibly rewarding experience to study a mountain range that is not as well described in the western literature as pretty much any other mountain range of its size. Don't get me wrong, it also can be a bit frustrating at times because 1) there's not much existing literature to fall back on (at least that I can read, my Russian leaves a lot to be desired), 2) it can be hard to rustle up attention or interest because there is not a large community of people working there, and 3) the lack of a large community means that from a career perspective I have a little bit of an uphill battle at times because my papers are not cited as much as papers on areas with more community interest (i.e. Himalayas). That being said, there is SO much to do in a place like the Caucasus.   I would say my favorite discovery was really a group effort between myself and several colleagues. There has been debate for decades about whether or nor there was a former subduction zone beneath the Greater Caucasus, but I would say one of our recent papers basically demonstrated that there is indeed a former subduction zone beneath the eastern part of the mountain range. That was pretty cool.  In general my field experiences have been awesome as well.

It is my understanding from what my wife and other geologists I know have stated (including a prof), and from books I have read, that the formations of The Rocky Mountains is probably the hardest problem in all of Geology.  Are we any closer to explaining the formation of The Rockies (other than very general ideas about uplift, etc)?"
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think in general what someone considers the hardest problem in geology, or any science, is almost exclusively dictated by what they work on. So, for me, as a geologist who only has a passing familiarity with the Rockies, it does not appear to be hardest problem in geology, but from the perspective of a geologist working on the Rockies, the things I'm working on probably seem similarly not hard. I think it's fair to say that we have a lot better handle on the geology of the Rockies than we do of many other places in the world (where I work being included). The fact that a lot of it has been mapped, multiple times, is a good start. It's also somewhat telling that we as a community have named a style of deformation after the Rockies (so-called ""Laramide style uplift"" was first described in the Rockies in relation to the Laramide orogeny, but the term has been ported to describe other places that demonstrate a similar style of crustal deformation). That's not to say that there are not lots of challenges and questions left in Rocky Mountain geology, and I'm in no way qualified to even begin to discuss what those challenges are, but I think you'll find that whether people agree or disagree with the statement ""The Rocky Mountains is probably the hardest problem in Geology"" will largely depend on whether said person works or does not work in the Rocky Mountains. Put another way, very few scientists work on a problem that they thinks is unimportant, but getting at an unbiased view of what is ""actually"" important or hard or whatever is going to be real difficult."

The western half of the mountain range has a large exposure of granites and metamorphic rocks, but most of the core of the range is actually barely metamorphosed sandstones and shales.

Laboratory experiments where small bits of minerals or rocks are put under large amounts of pressure and heated to high temperatures and then deformed in devices like this to try to approximate conditions deeper in earth's crust also form an important dataset for understanding what happens in deeper portions of mountain belts.  Finally, numerical models (with a lot of the mathematical rules used coming from results of the experiments described above, along with various physical laws, e.g. thermodynamics, etc) allow us to explore more theoretical aspects of deformation deeper in the crust that we can't physically simulate in the lab."

askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"In general, saying something is ""past due"" when referring to a stochastic process like earthquakes, floods, etc is problematic. We are indeed past the average recurrence interval for a large megathrust earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone (i.e. time since the last major event in 1700), but that average recurrence interval is based on records of earthquake events with periods of quiescence between events shorter than this average recurrence interval and longer than this average recurrence interval.  That being said, the important question is indeed when, rather than if, a large magnitude (M8 or greater) will hit the pacific NW. While some of the articles in the media that have come out have been a little sensationalist, my general feeling (and that of my colleagues who also study active deformation) is that they aren't too far off the mark in terms of both the risk of a large earthquake, the level of devastation that will occur, and the degree to which much of the pacific nw is not prepared for such an event."
askscience,3dm6vs,PunxsatownyPhil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"What does the height of a mountain range rely on most strongly? Minerals at the plate edges, speed of the plates at collision, size of the plates? Something else?"
askscience,3dm6vs,CrustalTrudger,2,Fri Jul 17 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"Copied from a reply above, which in turn is copied from a reply from a question several months ago in regards to what limits the height of a mountain range:  Work Required to Continue Building Topography This is probably the one that gets closest to what is being described in that top comment (""whereby they cause the earth's crust to compress from sheer mass""), but has less to do with isostasy and more to do with work (in the energy sense) involved in building topography. For mountain ranges like the Himalaya that are built through the collision of continents, this collision represents the energy input. At a certain point, the amount of work required to continuing to increase elevations exceeds the input and it is ""easier"" to simply expand the mountain range laterally. For those interested in a technical treatment of this, check out this paper.   Isostasy Isostasy is an important factor, but within that, the really important point is the nature of the lithosphere that the mountain range is sitting on. While thinking of topography on the Earth from a purely isostatic standpoint (i.e. blocks floating in water) works to some extent, the better description is in terms of flexure (i.e. blocks sitting on a taut sheet of elastic). The height of a mountain range (the height of your block measured relative to some reference) will depend on the density and size of the block and the strength, essentially the thickness of the elastic sheet. You could imagine the same exact block having very different heights depending on whether the sheet is very thin (sinks down a lot, block is not very high) or very thick (doesn't sink much, block is much higher). In terms of mountain ranges, this basically depends on the type of material in the mountain range, the shape of that mountain range, and the nature of the lithosphere it forms on. This is largely why Olympus Mons on Mars is as high as it is, not the gravity, but rather because the thickness and the rigidity of the Martian lithosphere is much much greater than Earth's and thus can support larger loads. Coupled with the lack of active tectonics and a fixed source for magma from a hotspot leads to a giant volcano.  Pressure-Temperature Conditions at the Base of a Mountain Range Probably one of the most important aspects for collisional mountain belts, like the Himalaya are the fact that they have reached the height they are by crustal thickening, basically the crust being deformed and stacked on top of itself. Because of the isostatic/flexural response, as the crust thickens, elevations increase but the depths (and thus the pressures and temperatures) that the bottom, or root, of your mountain range is experiencing also increase. At a certain point, the temperature and pressure conditions reach a point where the material making up the mountain range will change into a very dense rock called eclogite. The eclogite will be denser than the mantle rocks against which it is juxtaposed, which is gravitationally unstable, leading to a process called delamination, where this dense elcogitic root detaches and sinks into the mantle. Going back to the isostasy discussion, there is now a reduced thickness of crust which on the long term will lead to a reduction in elevations of the range.  Climate Another huge factor is the effect of climate and erosional processes on the height of mountain ranges. There is a relatively popular idea referred to as the ""glacial buzzsaw"" which predicts (and has been largely born out by data in many of the Earth's active mountain ranges) that mountain ranges generally will not exceed a certain height because of the actions of glaciers, check out this video that describes the ""buzzsaw"" in a simple way. Glaciers are incredibly efficient erosional agents, so once a mountain range reaches heights sufficient to start forming glaciers, the glaciers in turn buzz down the peaks of that range. The height limit imposed by glaciers would obviously depend on latitude (higher latitudes can support glaciers at lower elevations), general climate, and the precipitation patterns in the mountain range (still need precipitation to form glaciers)."

My masters thesis turned into some of the pilot data for an NSF proposal that he and I (and some other colleagues) co-wrote and was funded, which formed the basis for much of my PhD and so on and so forth.  A lot of the biggest challenges are logistical. From the US, getting into the field in the Caucasus is not cheap or simple and requires a fair amount of funding (so writing lots of grants), planning, and close work with foreign colleagues in both Azerbaijan and Georgia, without which, my/our work would not be possible.

askscience,3drtqt,haxtheaxe,8,Sat Jul 18 21:09:13 2015 UTC,"Steel wool is almost principally made of iron based on a google search. Assuming that your steel wool was made completely out of iron, what most likely happened was that the Iron, Fe0 (meaning that the iron is elemental, or not ionized at all), was oxidized to Fe+2 (an ionization state of +2... meaning that it lost 2 electrons). This is known as a redox reaction in chemistry (reduction and oxidation). Now, the reduction reaction takes place in the oxygen in the hydrogen peroxide (chemical formula H2O2). Normally, oxygen has an ionization state of -2 (it can only gain 2 electrons). However, in peroxides, oxygen has an oxidation state of -1. The important thing about redox is that it involves an exchange of electrons. In this case, the iron is undergoing the following reaction(oxidation): Fe0 -> Fe+3 + 3e- (e- is just shorthand for electrons)  Those same two electrons are used for oxygen, which is undergoing reduction: 3O- +3e- -> 3O-2  (the coefficient 2 in front of the terms is just used to make the electrons being transferred in each reaction equal)  So now we're left with O-2 and Fe+3. This forms Fe2O3, commonly known as rust. This is my best guess as to why you saw the rust form on the wool. This redox reaction also explains the increase in heat you saw in the cups. Now, the salt comes in because of the transfer of electrons. A certain type of medium must be present in order to allow electrons to be transferred. If you've ever stuck two wires, a battery, and a small lightbulb in a circuit-like fashion in a salt solution, the bulb lights up. The ionization (in this case ""breaking up"" of salt in the solution allows for the transfer of electrons. This ionization can be seen in the following reaction, assuming you're using table salt:  NaCl -> Na+ + Cl-  One thing that may throw a wrench into this entire thing is the presence of ""fumes or steam"". According to what I've already said, They must be hydrogen gas, H2. In its elemental state, hydrogen is diatomic (2 of them form a stable molecule), and a gas at STP, which is relatively close to the conditions that you're working at. Now that we've established that it's a gas, I would say that the gas you're producing is hydrogen. If you want to find out, you could test for it. To do this, take a very small piece of steel wool, and small amounts of salt and hydrogen peroxide, put them in the closest thing you have to a test tube, and light a match over it when you see the bubbles. If it makes a popping noise, it's hydrogen (hydrogen is very flammable in large amounts, so wear appropriate protection i.e. goggles, gloves, apron if you have it). If it doesn't, I was wrong and I just spent a hour of my life that I'll never get back."

askscience,3drtqt,Photocone,4,Sun Jul 19 00:49:09 2015 UTC,"This is a classic 'Redox' reaction; from a 10,000 foot view, the H2O2 gives up an oxygen to form Iron Oxide, FeO2 and FeO3, which is better known as rust.    In reality, the H2O2 scavenges an electron from the Fe in the steel, electrons prefer to travel in salt water (which is why salt water conducts electricity).  The electron jumps to the H2O2 forming H2O and O- which immediately grabs the Fe2+/Fe3+ to form iron oxide.  In the absence of NaCl, the electrons struggle to make it to the H2O2 because they are scavenged by the H+ ions in the water (which is why you would see bubbling in the absence of salt, but not a lot of action)  The process of the O- and the Fe2+ joining will give off a ton of heat, since it is exothermic.  The fumes you see may be hydrogen gas formed by a side reaction (the H+ floating around) which is exacerbated by the increase in temperature.  You can test this by putting a balloon over a bottle containing the mixture then lighting the balloon on fire (do this outside! It will disappear almost instantaneously)  Try raising the temp of the peroxide/steel mixture by 17 degrees to compare apples to apples.  You should see the same amount of fumes, give or take."

This is not due to polarity in the P-H bonds but rather the geometry of the molecule. Because the P-H bonds are not symmetrically-oriented about the phosphorus center, the electron distribution about the center is not symmetric and therefore there is a dipole."

The polarity of that bond is essentially zero, since their electronegativities are essentially similar. In other words, the distribution of electron density in that bond is very close to, if not perfect on, the center. But if your argument concerns pedantics, then I agree - since the electronegativities are not the exact same, the bond is not completely nonpolar in the most exact definition of the term. But for all practical purposes, it is because of the functionally equivalent electronegativities."
askscience,3dstf1,randoguy_16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:45:57 2015 UTC,"No, electronegativities are not additive. As a matter of fact, within the model that you are using, none of the electronegativities change at all! But we do have a way of measuring the contribution of electronegativity to other molecular properties. As others have mentioned, we use dipole moment to describe the difference in electronegativity between two or more atoms -- but this is not additive in the traditional sense.  Because electronegativity is a property of an individual atom, it has no direction at all and is therefore said to be a scalar quantity; on the other hand, dipole moment is between at least two atoms, and is said to be a vectorial quantity -- that is, it needs both magnitude and direction to be described. The dipole moment is related to the difference in electronegativity between two atoms (magnitude), and is said to be pointing directly through the center of their bond (direction). It is dipole moment that makes use of addition, but only in the vectorial sense, not in the scalar sense. You must account for the direction of the individual moment, which changes the total moment with respect to a variation in angle. This is why trigonal planar molecules like BH3 (difference in negativity of 0.16 for each B-H) do not have a total dipole moment when molecules like PH3 (difference in negativity of 0.01 for each P-H) do.  It does not make sense, then, to talk about electronegativities being additive. To add electronegativities is to say that I crammed two atoms into the exact same place, without changing either of their properties, and that I am allowing them to peacefully coexist without either of them affecting one another! It's silly, isn't it :)  On a side note, a quantitative measure of electronegativity is not agreed upon, and is based on everything from bond dissociation energy to atomic ionization energy. Fortunately, the periodic trends still hold."

Yes, since your lungs don't just serve as a way to oxygenate your blood but also remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from your blood stream. This is a byproduct of your cellular metabolism which if allowed to build up becomes just as lethal as a lack of oxygen would. The worst part is that it is CO2 build-up which causes you to experience the urge to breathe and all the symptoms of suffocation, so you'd die gasping for air despite perfectly good oxygen levels.  Still, there are indeed ways to bypass your lungs entirely by oxygenating  and cleaning your blood from CO2 directly. Some large hospitals have ECMO machines, as in extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. But these are used only in the most dire of circumstances as being put on ECMO usually requires a patient being put into a medically induced coma, is extremely dangerous and few people survive such a procedure for longer than a few weeks. And of course the equipment itself is very expensive and requires highly trained staff and a lot of maintenance.

But collapse of a quantum superposition does not represent a shift in energy. Well, if the collapse is to a state that has a lower energy level than before then energy is released. But wave function collapse can be to a state that has a higher or same energy level, and doesn't in itself refer to something changing energy."

In quantum mechanics all of these processes are described by wave functions that describe the probability of what will be observed if a measurement is made. When a measurement is made, the system ""collapses"" to one of the possibilities. If the possibility is that the atom gains an energy level, then it must have absorbed a photon. If it lowers an energy level, then it emitted a photon. And so on."

However, some tests have been done with tamarin monkeys to see which genres of music relax them, and scientists found that heavy metal (Of Wolf And Man by Metallica specifically) relaxed them. This is because some species of animals use cries for different signals, among them, relaxing, and these vocals were closely related to those cries.  As for dubstep/EDM/Punk/Thrash, you may go to a show and notice a mosh pit or dance circle. This category of behavior is attributed to the sounds these genres make. This comes back to animal behavior; researches have said this is ""music that shares aural characteristics with the vocalizations of distressed animals; captures human attention and is uniquely arousing"".  In other words, a pack of animals put together will mirror a sound and behaviors of a distressed animal.

askscience,3dslao,KnifeOfPi2,3,Sun Jul 19 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"Let's consider a lower-dimension analogue first. Imagine a cubic honeycomb, and alternately colour the cubes red and blue, so no two cubes of the same colour touch each other. Now divide each of the blue cubes into six pyramids, and attach all these blue pyramids to the unique red cube they are adjacent to. This gives you the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb.  Doing the same thing for the four-dimensional hypercube honeycomb, by dividing each of the blue hypercubes into eight cubic pyramids and attaching them to the red hypercubes, we get the 24-cell honeycomb.  This construction produces a honeycomb of vertex-transitive polytopes only in two or four dimensions. In n≥3 dimensions, the cells of the honeycomb have 2n+2n vertices, 2n being from the vertices of the red hypercubes (the ""red"" vertices) and 2n being from the centres of the adjacent blue hypercubes (the ""blue"" vertices). (In two dimensions, the red vertices have internal angles of 180 degrees and thus are degenerate.) Supposing that our initial hypercubic honeycomb is of unit hypercubes, consider the distance between a vertex and the centre of the cell. For a red vertex, this is √(n/4) (from Pythagoras's theorem) and for a blue vertex, this is 1. It then follows that there cannot be a rotation around the centre of a cell taking a blue vertex to a red vertex or vice versa, unless n=4, because rotations cannot change lengths.  The remaining step is to show that the 24-cell actually is vertex-transitive, and that can be done by explicitly constructing the symmetry group. This is left as an exercise for the reader."

Anyway, this equation has only one input - the density. If I assume a density of spam of 1 gram/cubic centimeter (which is the density of water, and a good approximation for nearly every biological material, like food or human flesh), I find that the ball of spam would be about 500 million miles across when it collapses into a black hole. If you centered that at the sun, it would extended well past Mars, but only about halfway to Jupiter.  Spam probably isn't too different from cheese in density - I'd just use the 1 gram/cc approximation again and end up with the same answer.  Similarly, for osmium, it looks like that ball would reach about halfway from the sun to the earth.

If my assumption is correct, then how is this accounted for in that equation? What if D is so big that it puts an object outside of the visible universe? From the equation, it would still produce a number greater than zero. But in reality, we would literally experience zero gravitational effects from that object until it becomes part of our visible universe.

askscience,3dpkmx,funnyorifice,15,Sat Jul 18 05:24:46 2015 UTC,"1. Would we be able to detect a Gamma-Ray burst heading towards Earth before it hit Earth?   No, but with a pretty big catch.   They don't come from nowhere. It would be impossible to detect something coming at us at the speed of light, but we'd know it was coming thousands of years in advance from observing nearby large stars and seeing if any are even candidates for emitting a GRB in our general direction.   2. What is the maximum range for a gamma-ray burst to pose a threat to Earth? I've read 200 light years is a conservative estimate.   The power output and degree of focus of a gamma ray burst can vary quite a lot, but try ~8000 lightyears.  There is a candidate star 5,000 lightyears away, but it's pointed wrong and will zorch a region of space which does not include Earth sometime in the next few hundred thousand years. Stars like that are incredibly rare, and other objects expected to produce GRBs (a pair of merging neutron stars for example) are even rarer.   3. What are the main threats to Earth?  4. For the side of Earth directly hit by the gamma-ray burst, would the people be killed immediately?   Air has a halving thickness of 15 meters. That is, every 15 meters the intensity of ionizing radiation will drop by half.  There's a lot of meters of air above you.  A few kilowatts per meter squared of gamma rays for a few seconds would be very fatal to astronauts and a little bad for people on jetliners, but on the ground you get no appreciable dose.  However, absorbing radiation would produce lots and lots of nitrogen oxides and destroy vast amounts of ozone. The paper I linked forecasts darker skies and a global ozone hole. This would sunburn plants and people and require you to wear sunglasses to reduce risk of blindness.  The nitrogen oxides will come down in rain eventually after a few months and the ozone reforms after a few years, but an environment where plants can't be grown except under a greenhouse due to cold and ultraviolet would be pretty apocalyptic.  And again just in case it got buried in my overly long post, this should never happen because of a lack of nearby objects capable of producing a GRB."

And can say from experience is very real.  http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/189/5/393  Excerpt, context is giving SSRIs to people under 18 and the effects of it:   The review found that for many of these drugs efficacy was not clearly demonstrated. It also found that for several of them there was an increased rate of self-harm and suicidal thoughts in participants given antidepressants relative to those given placebo.     And this is another one http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2799109/  Excerpt:   Not long after SSRIs were introduced, however, an unsettling thought was raised: that instead of protecting patients, SSRIs might have resulted in a number of suicides. Fluoxetine and paroxetine (Paxil, GlaxoSmithKline) were of particular concern in the early years of the SSRI era. Early suspicion about fluoxetine was raised in an article describing six cases in which severely depressed patients experienced intense feelings of suicidality soon after beginning fluoxetine therapy.15,16 Later, SSRIs were said to be more strongly associated with suicide than TCAs. In 2003, the Committee on Safety of Medicines in the United Kingdom blamed suicides on paroxetine and concluded that this drug should be contraindicated in patients with MDD who were younger than 18 years of age.   And a suggestions from the article of what could cause the increased suicides:   It has been suggested that some patients, especially young adults and the elderly, are placed at an increased risk of suicidality because of antidepressant-induced akathisia.34 It is also possible that depression in some patients, particularly younger patients who experience increased suicidality and low efficacy with antidepressants, has been misdiagnosed as unipolar depression instead of as a bipolar spectrum disorder"

Here is a review from 2009 that tried to find any data supporting this idea. Here are some highlights:   Thus the data that bear, albeit indirectly, on suicide risk in relation to phase of depression provide no consistent support for the belief that suicide risk increases as patients begin to recover; if anything, they refute it. Schweizer and colleagues (11) wrote, “As superficially appealing as the long-held mobilization-of-energy hypothesis is, it has little in the way of evidence to substantiate it.” We agree.   .   Of the half-dozen suicide experts we spoke to, all said they had been taught the theory and believed it to be true. Although a few thought that there must be some studies that back the idea, none could actually point to any data in support of it. “It’s something clinicians just know,” one said.   .   Without some substantiating data, this hunch does not warrant its long-held status as established truth.   This would seem to suggest that this long accepted truth is in fact just an unsubstantiated hypothesis. An equal valid hypothesis is that psychoactive drugs can change your thoughts and feelings and make some people more likely to harm themselves."

Now, too many completed suicides in your test group will quickly get your study shut down, but too small numbers don't bring any statistically sound result. So you have to rely on the self-reports of participants. Some of them will be compelling. Thoughts and thought structures that are completely alien to the person, urges they've never had before and that seem unrelated to their ""self"". That's most likely a side effect of the drug (or in extremstly rare cases the onset of psychosis coinciding with the drug test). But most effects will be a lot more subtle and harder to distinguish from the normal fluctuations of depression.   Add to it that psychoactive drugs have a vast variation in effect and it becomes pretty messy science. All drugs have some variation, that's normal and expected. But with psychoactive medication it goes so far that the strong effects they can have for individuals are almost drowned out by the large group of people that don't get any relief at all."

It's similar to medication I take for multiple sclerosis.  We are told that it cuts relapses by up to 50%, but how do you know if you were going to have a relapse if you then go on not to have it?   You can do trials with one group of people who are on SSRIs and monitor how many take their own lives or attempt to, compared with those who do not take SSRIs.  The difficulty is, it would be unethical to use double-blind placebo trials in these kinds of cases - as it could be argued that people taking 'sugar pills' who kill themselves may not have done it if they had been taking the real drug.  So a more ethical approach would be to monitor those who purposefully refuse to take SSRIs."

In my case the ideation went on for as long as I took them (multiple years), continued while I was not in any way depressed and ceased once I stopped taking them.  My personal theory is that they impact almost all brain functions in subtle ways. I think they inhibit the natural fear of death so that contemplating one's death (even by suicide) is a less traumatic feeling. So you tend not to shy away from the thought of doing it.

askscience,3drsf2,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It depends on what food resources are available. There are different food niches in different environments, and some may be more abundant than others.  Being an omnivore isn't free, it comes with costs. Omnivores are neither specialized as carnivores or herbivores, so they don't enjoy the full advantages of either lifestyle.  For example, herbivores may have several specialized adaptations for their diet, such as powerful jaws and molars to chew tough plant material, muti-chambered stomach, specialized bacteria that can digest cellulose and hemicellulose. This is why cows or horses can live on grass, while humans can't. We can only digest a small range of plant products - fruits, some starchy tubers or rhizomes, etc. We get next to no calories from leaves and other plant parts that are mainly cellulose. But herbivores can digest them.  Similarly, carnivores have adaptations for their lifestyle which we don't have. They have highly acidic stomachs, much more so than ours, to quickly dissolve flesh and digest it. Such high acidity also protects them from a lot of parasites in their food. Humans have to cook food to kill the parasites. Carnivores produce a lot of digestive juices for digesting proteins. Humans have a hard limit for how much protein they can digest, which is why it's possible for humans to undergo ""protein starvation"" where their bodies starve no matter how much meat they eat, because we can only digest so much protein per day. Eskimos or other people who survive mostly on meat avoid this by eating a lot of fat.  So being an omnivore is a bit of a compromise. It increases the range of things you can eat, but you aren't adapted to any of them as well as more specialized animals might be.  But it suits us because we are also among the most behaviorally and geographically diverse, living in a lot of very different environments. So being a bit of a generalist even at the expense of not being the best at utilizing any one food can still be a net benefit. When you factor in intelligence and stuff that follows (cooking), it becomes even better."

askscience,3drsf2,king_of_the_universe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, very few organisms have evolved the ability to digest cellulose. Cows or other ruminants can't either, so they harbor bacteria (like Cellulomonas) in their rumen which digests the cellulose and breaks it into into simpler sugars which the cows can digest. Termites that feed on wood do something similar - they harbor certain protozoa that break cellulose into molecules the termite can use.  Humans could possibly do this in a lab, but I'm not sure if it would be for food. There are several research efforts underway to insert the cellulase genes into bacteria like E. coli, so we could use them to break down cellulose and hemicellulose. But it's not for food, it's for biofuels. Currently we make ethanol mostly from corn, which is kind of a waste, because corn is perfectly edible for humans too. Corn has starches that we can digest just fine.  It would be much better to be able to produce ethanol from plants that aren't edible, that have cellulose instead of starch. There's an effort to engineer bacteria that would do this so we could use weeds and junk plants instead of corn. It's been done in labs but they're having problems scaling it for industrial use. It's specifically for creating biofuels, but in theory if you can do that, you could produce foods too."

The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton.   The same goes for the anti-electron, the positron. Electrons repel each other electrically (due to same charge) but attract each other (with a way smaller magnitude) gravitationally.

But in a quantum theory if you have any particles with negative rest-energy then they would be produced spontaneously and cause immediate problems; this is evident in any theory that includes a tachyon.

Quantum fields have a value or energy at every point in space and that value typically varies from point to point. However, if a field were to take on a constant value so that its energy was the same at every point in space, the field would actually create uniform negative pressure which would blow space apart at incomprehensible speeds. Inflation theory posits that just after the Big Bang, the hypothetical inflaton field took on a constant value for a tiny fraction of a second, ballooning the cosmos out to enormous distances before the field's value changed throughout space, ending the repulsive gravity and inflation."

Is that right?  If that's true, then wouldn't the planet also have to be orbiting the black hole almost right on the event horizon (which is obviously impossible)?

As soon as they started talking about ""retrieving the quantum data from inside the black hole"" and ""fifth dimensional"" aliens, I sort of lost interest.  The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a Schwarzschild black hole is at r = 6M (where the horizon is at r = 2M), so the time dilation factor due to gravity alone (between someone on the surface and someone at infinity) would be sqrt(3/2).  They also sort of implied that above some altitude, gravitational time dilation suddenly stopped rather than dropping off continuously with distance, which is clearly not true.  I wasn't aware that the movie had been praised for accuracy.  I like the idea of the story: bad boy engineer teams up with some of the world's greatest scientists to go on a mission to save Earth/his family.

askscience,3dqhyf,TacticusPrime,9,Sat Jul 18 13:47:44 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on your idea of brown.  The ""7 colors of the rainbow"" is something of a reassuring lie we tell ourselves. The discreteness of ROYGBIV is a consequence of history and human perception, and not the actual nature of the rainbow. Indeed, it's a consequence of numerology that Aristotle and Newton were keen on identifying seven fundamental colors. Your eye can actually perceive differences within the individual bands in the visible spectrum quite readily. The rainbow is a smooth transition of hues between the lower end of the visible spectrum and the upper end.  That said, I'm not a color theorist or interior designer, but 'brown' refers to a huge number of colors and I imagine you could produce things people will call 'brown' in a variety of ways. Perhaps a monochromatic red/orange with low saturation and low luminosity might do the trick for someone. But maybe not.  So if you were more nuanced in your choice of color? In that case, I'd like to ask a follow up question, why isn't white in the rainbow? You know the answer to this - it's just because it's a composite color. Using the slightly more advanced technique of mixing colors to produce something outside the rainbow, I was able to reproduce a nice poopy brown with a simple mixture of red and green light."
askscience,3dqhyf,VeryLittle,4,Sat Jul 18 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"You have to be a bit careful there.  A mix of red with half as much green, with full saturation and brightness, looks orange to us, but orange is in the rainbow.  The reason red+green/2 looks orange is that both trigger the same response in the receptors of our eyes, which are roughly RGB sensors.    I suppose in a sense the colours of the rainbow are all the colours there are.  Anything else is essentially an artefact of our vision.   For instance, there is no colour in the rainbow that corresponds to magenta, which is what we see when our eye receives red and blue at the same time.  If our eyes were perfect spectrometers we would see that an object was both red and blue, not magenta.  But then again, all colours are an artefact of our vision, light knows nothing of colour."
askscience,3dqhyf,FrightenedOfSpoons,6,Sat Jul 18 15:14:06 2015 UTC,"Brown is a large collection of colours which are all essentially orangey colours with low luminescence or saturation (perhaps slightly red-ish or yellow-ish orange). Orange is in the rainbow because it has a corresponding wavelength of light (a rainbow is just white light split up into the various wavelengths), but rainbows always have high luminescence and saturation, so you never see it as brown.  So that's one way to make brown - just take pure orange light (wavelength of 590-620nm) and reduce the luminescence and/or saturation. In that way, it kind of is in the rainbow.  There are, however, many colours that we are capable of perceiving that really aren't in the rainbow, including many hues of brown. That is, there are colours that we perceive that cannot be recreated by shining pure light of a particular wavelength into our eyes. Why? Because our perception of colour comes from three types of cone cell in our eyes, which are each stimulated by different ranges of wavelengths. They each peak around approximately red, green, and blue wavelengths of light, but respond to other wavelengths too, just to a lesser degree. The whole variety of colours we can see (the gamut) comes from stimulating these three cells different amounts in different combinations. Only certain combinations can be triggered by pure wavelengths of light. Others can only come from combining wavelengths.  The classic case is magenta, which is the colour we perceive when our red and blue cones are stimulated (and green is not). There is no singular wavelength of light that can stimulate the cones in this way, which is why there's no part of the rainbow that looks magenta. We can only trigger the perception of magenta by stimulating the red and blue cones separately with a combination of different wavelengths.  The same will be true for some particular brown colours. While there are a whole load of brown colours you can get just by taking the orangey wavelengths and lowering the luminescence and/or saturation, there are some that you can only get by stimulating the cones with combinations of different wavelengths."
askscience,3dqhyf,sftrabbit,3,Sat Jul 18 17:30:48 2015 UTC,"A rainbow is the separation of white light (which contains all wavelengths) spread out in order of wavelength. Each color in the rainbow is a single wavelength of light.   The colors that we perceive in the world are actually mixtures of many different wavelengths, just as many sounds aren't pure tones.  We do not perceive every wavelength of light equally. We have three different types of cones that are sensitive to different wavelengths that roughly correlate to RGB.  How we perceive color relates to how much each of the three receptor types is stimulated.  TLDR: most colors we perceive are made up of many wavelengths of light, but a rainbow only contains the ones that are made up of a single wavelength."
askscience,3dqhyf,st_raged,0,Sat Jul 18 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"The human eye can only perceive three colours: Red, Green and Blue (hence RGB displays). Every color you see that is not one of those is because the brain interprets the proportion of the base colors in what your are looking at, and calculates that it might be , say, yellow if there are equal parts green and red.  Now, more complex colors are made much the same way, they are interpreted by the brain. Brown is made usually by combining red, black and yellow.   Since red, yellow and black do not overlap in a rainbow, you cannot ever get brown in it!"

askscience,3dowv8,bunchajibbajabba,5,Sat Jul 18 09:42:18 2015 UTC,"First of all, now you're talking about the interaction of a classical EM wave with a material, not a photon. It's a different branch of physics.  That has mostly to do with the structure of the material at the scale of the wavelength. If the material is granular or irregular at the scale of hundreds of nanometers, incoming light will be diffused irregularly, yielding an opaque surface. If the material is regular, and does not absorb or reflect (like metals) light significantly, light will pass through mostly unimpeded and the object will appear transparent.  The light-atom interaction (which is primarily a light-electrons interaction) is determined both by the structure of the atomic lattice but also by the structure at the wavelength and higher scale (basically, all scales inbetween the wavelength and the smallest object you can see). For example, ice and snow are chemically and structurally identical at the atomic scale, but the opacity is very different."
askscience,3dowv8,rantonels,2,Sat Jul 18 10:26:03 2015 UTC,"What happens is the EM wave is absorbed by the first atom it strikes. In fact, by the electrons bound to the atom. It works very much like when you are pushing a child on a swing. You give it energy at the right frequency, it'll absorb all of it and go higher. If you are not quite on that specific, resonant frequency, the electrons will re-emit the EM wave in the same direction it was going. This will get absorbed and emitted by the next atom, so on so forth, until you have gone through the material.  In a pane of glass, you'll have something like 96% of the energy going through, and 4% being reflected or absorbed.   Now, dark materials are kind of like a child that is very good at swinging. Their electrons pick up all of the energy you put into them to swing higher (heat, mostly) . Hence, black surfaces like asphalt tend to get hotter in the sunlight.  Finally, you can tweak a material's chemical make-up and thickness so as to get materials that are anti-reflective , band filters, so on, using interference. This is the field of optical thin coats, and this is what allows Low-e windows, anti-reflection sunglasses, and many other useful technologies."
askscience,3dowv8,PlaydoughMonster,4,Sat Jul 18 14:48:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, photons do pass through most atoms, even in dark materials. Absorption coefficients are given in per centimeter.  So an absorption coefficient of 1 per cm means the light drops by 1/e in 1 cm.  Let's look at frozen water for example.  In the visible the absorption coefficient is less than about 10-4 cm-1.  The energy where a photon matches the resonant frequency of the O-H stretch, the absorption coefficient rises to close to 105 cm-1.  (Ockman PhD thesis, circa 1957 or 58; Mastrapa et al, 2008.  Icarus 197, 307–320.)  Metals have very high absorption coefficients, e.g. iron about 106 cm-1 (Ordal et al., 1985. Optical properties of fourteen metals in the infrared and far infrared: Al, Co, Cu, Au, Fe, Pb, Mo, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ag, Ti, V, and W. Appl. Opt. 24, 4493–4499).  At 106 cm-1 (108 per meter), and atomic bond distances of a couple of angstroms, ~2x10-10 meters, the 1/e probability that any one atom/atomic bond absorbs a photon is ~2x10-2.  For transparent materials like ice in the visible it drops to ~10-12 per atomic bond."

As far as the fruits that can though, like bananas in your example, ripening involves a change in the types of molecules inside the fruit rather than replacement of what is inside by incoming nutrients from the host plant. While growing, a fruit depends on nutrients provided by the tree, but once the fruit is grown there are substantial energy reserves in the fruit itself so most of the rest of the work is done on a cellular level by the cells inside that fruit. Depending on the fruits we're talking about different chemicals (sugars vs acids and ratios to other compounds) but the general process is carried out at the cellular level where say a certain molecule in an unripe banana is changed by the action of enzymes into a tasty sugar that you'd find in your ripe banana. Interestingly, these cells are often waiting for signals to tell them when to start doing this, signals like ethylene for example so an unripe banana can be picked then later signaled with ethylene gas to speed up the ripening process."
askscience,3dqsxf,lostthesis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:15:49 2015 UTC,It has to do with ethylene. Some fruits continue to ripen after being picked but ripening is hastened with ethylene. Ones that don't continue to ripen I believe can still be exposed to ethylene gas to continue the ripening.
askscience,3drx7w,iammandalore,6,Sat Jul 18 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"Bell peppers are all green at first and become different colors (red in this case) when ripe. So the pepper is ripening and as a result changing color.   The reason it is ripening on one side is because of ethylene gas. Ripe fruits emit this gas, which then encourages other fruits exposed to the gas to become ripe. It is a nice feedback loop that gets all of the fruit on one tree to ripen all at the same time, which is a good thing if you want your fruit to go uneaten by predators (predator satiation).  Overripe fruit spills out even more ethylene, which can encourage spoilage of the whole pile.   So the tomatoes are nice and ripe, are spitting out ethylene, and causing the peppers to ripen further. The pepper is exposed much more on one side than the other so it ripens on that side much more quickly.  Bonus - bananas are especially good at making ethylene and ethylene can go through plastic but not paper. So if you want to get your fruit a bit more ripe throw it in a paper bag with a (brownish) banana for a day or two. A kerosene heater also makes ethylene as it burns, so if you have a whole greenhouse of fruits you need ripened quickly you can cheat with that, too."

Starting back fires to (hopefully) consume the fuel in a controlled manner also helps, but if the wind starts and a ember crosses the line you have to start over.

askscience,3dqill,zulupineapple,4,Sat Jul 18 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"I believe sugars are very different from fats and proteins. The reason we add so much sugar to soda (and subsequently replace it with non-caloric sweeteners) is because our bodies evolved to crave sugar as the most immediate, usable form of energy. The sensation of sweet is something that we have come to expect, and so once we found a molecule that activates those same taste-bud receptors, but is not metabolized, we took advantage of it. On the other hand, fats and proteins were not as immediately important, so we were not evolved to have the same distinct, pleasant reaction as soon as we ate them. The reason we have have sugar substitutes is because of how prominent ""sweet"" is in our palate, and how much of it we consume.  Now lets talk about feasibility. Sugar is a relatively simple molecule, and non-caloric sugars are related, simple molecules. Proteins help make up the structural backbone of living matter, and are INCREDIBLY DIVERSE. You could not make a simple modification to one protein, like with a sugar, to make it non-caloric. Even if you found a protein that our bodies don't digest, the meat we eat is comprised of so many various proteins that there is absolutely no way we could alter all of them, let alone any of them, to be non-caloric. Considering that they also make up the structural backbone of animal tissue, how could we alter these molecules without causing the tissue structure to collapse? Sugars don't necessarily form the structure of tissue, so their alteration is purely for our sensory pleasure. Proteins are needed, in their natural form, to provide structure and composition to the tissue we eat. Also, how would we even do this? The way biological processes synthesize and arrange proteins is the most basic element of perpetuating life. We do not have the technology to create tissue, either from scratch or by commandeering biological processes and altering them for our purposes. We can make sugars, they're simple. We simply cannot assemble proteins in the infinitely complex way that our bodies do in order to produce viable tissue. Even if we could alter and change the proteins that were produced, evolution has carefully winnowed out ineffective and unworkable proteins that would not produce viable specimen, if we fundamentally change the nature of these proteins, I do not think it remotely possible that something viable will be produced, it would probably all fall apart and not order itself into a biological system.  Last point is that non-caloric means non-metabolized. We have enough sugar (from natural sources, because we cannot implant artificial sugar into meats, dairy, etc.) in our diets, so we can live without excess added sugar. If we prevent our bodies from using proteins as raw materials, then would would basically be starving and malnourishing ourselves, and the effects would probably be fatal.  TL;DR: Royale with Cheese is here to stay.  EDIT: A lot of this applies to fats too, very very complex."

About feasibility. To my understanding fats are a lot simpler than proteins. Moreover, we don't need to mimic all of their properties. We only need the substitutes to taste similarly. The substitute patty might as well be some tasteless sponge marinated in the substitute fats. As for diversity, are the taste receptors as diverse as the proteins they match? We only need to target the former.  Last point is that places that have hamburgers tend to have more problems with obesity than with starvation."
askscience,3dqill,blacksheep998,4,Sat Jul 18 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"There do exist indigestible fats that can be used as a no calorie substitute for fats.  The problem is that fats are greasy, and if your body doesn't digest them then they're still greasy when they come out the other end.  You may remember years ago some potato chips tried using some of these and it resulted in people having massive and uncontrollable diarrhea."
askscience,3dqill,aamfs94,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:05:56 2015 UTC,"Fats are also integrated into biological systems considering that they are very important for different physiological processes. It would be impossible to grow tissue that uses a fat that is non-caloric for humans, but somehow beneficial for the tissue. Unfortunately, your hamburger idea is practically impossible. It would basically require us to fabricate a new form of life, with new molecules that aren't metabolized by humans, but are by whatever being uses them.   The only way I see fats as feasible is if we treated them like sugar, in that we could synthesize a type of this non-caloric fat in a laboratory, and add it to cakes, muffins, etc. instead of the traditional butter. Foods that contain fat naturally, like meat and avocados, would still produce calories.  Also, it seems you have a misunderstanding of the obesity epidemic. Obesity isn't a problem of nourishment, it's a problem of calories. Obese americans obtain most of their calories from fats and sugar, and so eating balanced, wholesome, nutritious foods is actually a major priority in terms of combatting obesity. Eliminating biological proteins would be counterintuitive to this goal, and would significantly hamper efforts to correct the american diet. You don't correct a poor diet by encouraging consumption, but reducing the harm of that consumption, that endorses unhealthful behaviors in ways that are much more difficult to rectify (lack of vitamin/mineral intake, lack of fiber, etc.). You correct a poor diet by actually changing the status quo. Sugar substitutes haven't done much for obesity, and other substitutes won't either. It perpetuates a feeling of entitlement for consumption, and people will find ways to ingest excess calories regardless, with this attitude."
askscience,3dqill,Arcola56,0,Sat Jul 18 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"Human alteration of foods is extremely dangerous. Let me explain. Using alternate forms of sugar isn't a really big deal because most of these are actually produced by nature, or us, and can be metabolized by something in our bodies. Fats are also a wide class of molecules, but tinkering with them can have bad results. One example are trans fats, which are created using chemical, industrial reactions instead of enzymatic ones, leading to hydrogenation. Chemically altering these, though, have other consequences. First, fats are used to create cholesterol, cellular membrane components, and steroids and hormones, making them a huge signaling precursor. Introducing these non-metabolic, synthetic fats into our body is pretty much universally deemed unhealthy, which is why many food labels advertise 0 trans fats. Proteins, as others have stated, are actually a very complex polymer. We actually can change protein structures (ever heard of GMOs?), but that doesn't change their metabolic fats. Your GI tract is full of enzymes called peptidases that cut the proteins into their individual components, which are readily metabolized into sugars and fats. It would be impossible (at least in the next 20 years) to create synthetic protein enantiomers that we would be unable to metabolize. But even if you could, I would reckon that these could be quite detrimental to you as well. Finally, though we can make many compounds, mass producing them is extremely inefficient (in comparison to the efficiency of enzymes), and it is not feasible to to do at a large enough scale to meet human demand."
askscience,3dqill,RRautamaa,2,Sun Jul 19 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"There is an artificial fat substitute called Olestra. However, the problem with these is that it is difficult to make an inert ""fat"" which doesn't cause gastrointestinal distress. The fat substitute would retain its texture even in the colon, and even if it is not digestible by humans, it may be digestible by intestinal bacteria. The exact same problems appear with sugar substitutes such as sugar alcohols.  It is possible to produce, at an expense, indigestible and biologically inert amino acid analogues. I attended a presentation at our university on beta-amino acids. They resemble natural amino acids but peptides made from them cannot be broken down by proteolytic enzymes. However, betapeptide synthesis would be way too expensive for a cheap product like food.  Texturing the protein so that it resembles meat convincingly, cheap, is also an unsolved problem. There are reasonably good chicken imitations on the market, though."

askscience,3dnbmp,Piratefluffer,75,Fri Jul 17 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Two reasons, 1) helium is very light, which means that helium atoms can easily escape the atmosphere, and 2) because helium, because it is a non-reactive noble gas is not incorporated in many other compounds and minerals.  To start off with the first point, every astronomical body has a characteristic escape velocity, which is given by ve=sqrt(2GM/R), where ve is the escape velocity, G is the gravitational constant, and R is the radius of the body. Note that the escape velocity does not depend on the mass of the particle that is escaping! On the other hand, the average energy distribution of gaseous particles is almost identical and is described by the Maxwell distribution, which looks like this. The kinetic energy in turn is described by KE=1/2mv2 , where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is the velocity. This means that for a given average energy, lighter particles will have a higher average velocity. Putting everything together, lighter particles, such as helium will have a higher velocity and heavier atoms/molecules, and so will have a much higher chance of having enough energy to escape the atmosphere. The same is true for the most abundant element in the universe, hydrogen, which in the atmosphere exists in the form of H2, which is even lighter than He and therefore can escape even more readily. However, this is less of a problem because...  2) Hydrogen because of its chemical nature is incorporated in a vast set of organic and inorganic compounds and minerals. Therefore, there is no shortage of hydrogen in various forms lying around. Helium on the other hand is a noble gas and is not very reactive. Therefore He mostly likes to remain in its atomic form, which as we saw tends to float away and out of the atmosphere. In fact, most of the helium that currently exists on Earth is not a remnant from the Earth's formation, but has actually been produced as a result of radioactive decay. Some of this helium was then trapped in pockets of natural gas, from where it can be extracted for commerical use."

Argon, or even normal air would be insanely expensive to compress for use at supersonic flows due to non ideality. A compressor for compressing helium already can cost millions of dollars if you're trying to reach a few hundred atmospheres.  Flows exceeding 800mph are relatively easy with helium as you have to impart a lot less momentum to the helium.  Secondly once you start working on the nanoscale, If you want better shielding within perforated molecules, such as carbon nanotubes, and other higher order complex structures, use helium, because helium atoms can fit inside, whereas argon cannot, and nitrogen has questionable geometry at that scale.

Edit: oh and no, we dont use it in any reactions directly. It is an inert gas that does not react very easily at all. It is useful for exactly that reason actually.

The mass specific energy for an object in Earth orbit is   E = v2 / 2 - u / r = -u / (2*a)   where u (denoted by greek lowercase mu) is the standard gravity parameter for Earth equal to GM, or Newton's gravitational constant times the mass of the earth = 3.986E+05 km3 / s2.  assuming a circular orbit ( a == r), the sideways velocity needed to stay there is.  v_c = sqrt(u / r)  So, if you just use a rocket to go up very high to some radius 'r' away from the center of the Earth, you would need to be going 'v_c' km / s sideways in order to stay in a circular orbit, otherwise you'll just fall back to Earth eventually.  If you want to hover over one spot over the Earth, you need to be in a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), which is at about r = 42,000 km and be moving sideways at about 3 km/s.  All these numbers are approximate because I rounded GEO orbit.

askscience,3dqktw,jndb,3,Sat Jul 18 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Through the metabolic processes of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, cells transfer the energy stored in carbohydrates and fats to molecules of ATP.  Your muscles contain bundles of the microfilament protein actin, and the motor protein myosin that moves along actin molecules.  When the electric signal from a neuron stimulates a muscle cell, calcium ions basically trigger myosin to start working.  When this happens, ATP molecules bind with the head of a myosin molecule.  This causes the myosin head to release the actin fiber.  The myosin head is spring loaded to jump forward.  At this point, the ATP molecule is hydrolyzed to ADP; this process releases the energy.  The myosin molecule binds to the actin molecule again, but at a point that's further ahead then it was before.  Then, the myosin molecule folds up, pulling the actin molecule along.  This is called the power stroke.  Finally, the ADP molecule is released, a new ATP molecule binds in its place, and the process starts over.  For an overview: muscle contraction"

askscience,3drh76,RunForFun277,7,Sat Jul 18 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"The difference is that you would fuse different atoms to create energy then you would break apart to generate energy. This is analogous to chemical reactions, in certain cases creating bonds releases energy, while in other cases letting bonds break apart is energetically favorable. The general idea is that you want to go from a less stable configuration to a more stable configuration. For nuclear systems, you can figure out what processes would be exergonic (energetically favorable) by looking at how the nuclear binding energy per nucleon (i.e. proton or neutron) changes going from one nucleus to another, as shown in this graph. Notice that for very light atoms, such as hydrogen, the binding energy is quite low and the slope moving towards nuclei with more nucleons is quite steep. This indicates that for these nuclei, fusion would be highly energetically favorable. On the other hand as nuclei get increasingly heavier, the binding energy reaches a maximum, and then it starts to drop again. By the time you get to the various isotopes of Uranium, you can see that it would be more energetically favorable for the nuclei to split. This is why in this regime, one uses fission in order to extract energy."

askscience,3drh76,SiberianShibe,2,Sat Jul 18 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"The key is in how tightly the protons and neutrons are held together. If a nuclear reaction produces nuclei that are more tightly bound than the originals then energy will be produced, if not you will need to put energy in to make the reaction happen.  The most tightly bound atomic nuclei are around the size of iron (with 26 protons in the nucleus). That is, one can release energy either by splitting very large nuclei (like uranium with 92 protons) to get smaller products, or fusing very light nuclei (like hydrogen with just one proton) to get bigger products. In both cases the reaction shifts the size of the atoms involved towards iron. The energy gain is released in the form of kinetic energy of products (which usually converts to heat – random motion in the medium).

askscience,3drh76,DBivansMCMLXXXVI,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"Although they seem to have similar effects, they do actually produce completely different effects.   Fission is causes by neutrons splitting other atoms, which then causes more neutrons to be created, causing a run away reaction if the nuclear fuel is dense enough and in a large enough mass to be critical.   Fusion doesnt produce neutrons directly, but fusion weapons produce them because they are started by an atomic bomb that is used to harness X-rays to set off the fusion section.   Fusion releases photons. When the atoms are fused, the new atom is not the size of the two smaller ones put together. The difference in mass is converted into photons, which can be so powerful that they cause more fusion.   So the actual types of energy and particles given off are much different. Its a lot like comparing an oxidizer to a reducing agent. They work in different ways, but can still produce effects that appear similar to the eye.   The type of energy isnt the same. We expect it to be similar because of the explosions, but the act energy we see in the fireballs is not the same type of energy. The force produced is much different, despite both producing fireballs."
askscience,3dp1dl,XxThrowAway1xX,5,Sat Jul 18 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we should assume the blocks can be joined at their side, since the question specifies lego bricks, and they can only be joined top and bottom.  So, if we take that view, that we're only interested in structures that can be made by joining bricks together, then we know: - There are 3 different ways you can connect 2x2 blocks together. the low number of options is because the bricks are symmetrical, and only have 4 contact points - I count 14 different ways to attach 2 * 2x4 bricks together to create different resulting shapes  In this example, I propose that 50 2x4 bricks has more combinations because 1450 > 3100"

askscience,3dp1dl,irate_black_man,2,Sun Jul 19 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"Very true. My example is simplistic, it only considers joining 2 blocks, and extrapolates that into the total number of blocks available. I've also ignored situations where for just 2 blocks, 2 variations are symmetrical and therefore when one is rotated, create the same total structure. As you add more blocks, this isn't true.  As you say, once you have a structure of a few blocks, you get a lot more options of where to add the next block. However, I think if you take this view, you are still left with more options for the 2x4 blocks.  The main reason this is true is because the 2x2 block has rotational symmetry, vastly reducing the number of different structures that can be created. the 2x4 is not, giving several times more possible outcomes for each stud connection"
askscience,3dp1dl,cjuk00,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"Let's get some more concrete definitions in here:  A structure of N lego bricks is defined to be N lego bricks in any combination, connected or not, touching or not.  However, the bricks are all oriented flat, and at right angles to the plane. The connector holes are always on the top and bottom as expected, and the bricks are rotated at any angle.  Hence there is only 1 way to place the 2x2 brick and 2 ways to place the 2x4 brick, when not accounting for rotation (we are not, here).  Two lego bricks are said to be connected if either of the following hold: 1. They are directly above/below the other with at least 1 connector hole overlapping, or 2. There is a chain of blocks connected as described in (1) which go between the selected lego bricks.  A building combination of N bricks is defined to be a structure of N lego bricks where all N lego bricks are connected.  Two building combinations are said to be equivalent if they contain the same number of bricks and if the entire structure of one can be rotated so that the two structures could overlap perfectly - the same size bricks in the same exact places.    So, the question has become, are there more distinct building combinations of 50 2x4 legos or of 100 2x2 legos.  And I say we can ignore the ""distinct"" restriction right off the bat.  Why?  It is only going to affect the result by at most a factor of 4, since there are 4 rotations, and worst case every determined structure when we count can be rotated into another.  But with numbers as big as they are, a factor of 4 is likely not to make a difference.  We can account for it at the end just to be sure though.  Next... it is actually very very hard to try counting and not count the same thing twice, or to not miscount by counting impossible structures where bricks overlap.  To the point of, I'm not certain you'll be able to get an exact answer here.  Or even a reasonably close answer.  For instance, let's suppose we restrict the problem even further, and are okay with only adding legos on top of the last lego you added - we'll make a wobbly tower.  With 2x2 legos, there are 9 ways you can add a new one on top.  And with 2x4 legos, there are (5 x 5) + (3 x 7) = 46 ways you can add a new one on top.  With that, we can get a pretty solid estimate of 4650 versus 9100.  But these are pretty close - only different by a factor of 1012.  With this particular restriction, it is clear that there are more for 2x2, but we can't just extrapolate and say it is clear without the restriction.  Another way to think about it is to try comparing how many ways with one 2x4 versus two 2x2s, two 2x4 versus four 2x2s, etc.  But even that is very difficult to count without creating a computer program.  My last heuristic is to compare how you can add a 2x4 to another 2x4, and see if you can mimic that with 2x2s.  If you can mimic the connection, that it means we can construct a connected 2x2 structure that looks exactly the same as a 2x4 structure, just with 2x2s instead.  And this heuristic is what makes me think that there are far far more 2x2 building combinations than 2x4 building combinations.  If you iterate over the different ways of connecting a 2x4 brick with another 2x4 brick, you can either perfectly mimic it with 2x2 pieces instead, or else, you're left with disconnected 2x2 bricks - which mean that they can be ""freely applied anywhere"".  Those disconnected bricks are a multiplier, giving rise to a lot more combinations than would otherwise be possible when restricted to the form of a 2x4 brick.  Sorry I can't give a better answer - but this problem really has the feel of a problem from a computational algorithm contest, so if you really want a solid answer, try getting one of the experts there to work on it."

Then you can connect the second brick in 8 different ways using 1 stud, 12 different ways using 2 studs, 4 different ways using 3 studs, 10? different ways using 4 studs, 2 different ways using 6 studs, and 1 way using all 8 studs. So with two 2x4 bricks, you have 8+12+4+10+2+1=37 different combinations.   The tricky part is, some of those configurations cover up other possible configurations, so the third brick can't be attached in some of those configurations. However, the third brick can be placed on the top or the bottom of the second brick, not even touching the first brick's studs. So there are exponentially more combinations available for each brick, and I don't know a simple way to cover all of them.   For a rough approximation, assuming that the third brick cannot be placed on the bottom of the second brick or the top of the first brick, and so on and so forth for each new brick, there are 37*49 simple combinations. 37 different ways of placing a brick, times 49 different bricks to be placed on top of the first brick."

If the universe where infinite and unchanging, then any straight line of a given length would have a 50% chance of intersecting with any celestial body. If you double it, it would be a 75% chance, etc. So an infinite line would almost certainly collide with something, and if you look in that direction, you should see a star. But this isn't the case. If you look at the night sky, stars make up a tiny portion of it.  The reason for this is that the universe is only 13.8 billion years old. Beyond a certain distance, you're looking far enough into the past that there were no stars.  But I guess if you mean spacelike lines, I'm going to say that there almost certainly isn't such a line. The probability of a line being like that decreases exponentially with length, but the number of lines only increases with the cube of the distance to the origin.  If the universe is a perfect sphere, then the great circles that form the geodesics (which is the closest thing there is to a line in non-Euclidean geometry) are of finite length and if the universe is small enough there'd be plenty of them, but the universe is not a perfect sphere. Massive objects bend it, so any geodesic you send won't quite match up when it loops around.

So far as we know, nothing (with mass) can accelerate to the speed of light. The energy required is infinite as you get close to it.  The more practical difficulty is the limits of rockets right now. Again, so far as we know, there's no way to generate useful thrust without throwing stuff out the back end, so to speak. With some quick (possibly erroneous) back-of-the-envelope math, if you wanted to end up with a 1 kg payload moving 450000 m/s (roughly 1 million mph) using a liquid-fueled rocket, you'd need to start with a rocket with a mass of 2.6E44 kg (!), which for reference is a couple of orders of magnitude larger than the mass of the Milky Way. So... somewhat impractical. This is because liquid rockets aren't especially efficient.   Ion engines are markedly more efficient, but the issue there is that they require a lot of electrical power and don't generate a lot of thrust. Assuming a rather optimistic exhaust velocity of 210000 m/s and thrust of 2.5 N, you could get the payload to 1 million mph if you started with a rocket a little over twice as massive. You could even hit that velocity in about a quarter of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. The difficulty is that to power the thing you may well need a nuclear reactor, and nobody has been in a hurry to strap one to the top of a rocket yet."
askscience,3dqy3u,illiterati1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Acceleration is not a linear function of energy input. In other words, as the object approaches higher speeds, it takes a lot more energy to accelerate the object a certain amount than it would take to accelerate it that same amount when it was moving slower. That's why you can't just keep accelerating something until it reaches close-to-light speeds."
askscience,3dqy3u,randoguy_16,2,Sun Jul 19 05:36:27 2015 UTC,"This only really applies to objects moving near the speed of light, which we're nowhere near with current technology. For significantly lower speeds, it's true that you can effectively just keep accelerating.  The problem, though, is conservation of momentum. To quote a clever line from Interstellar, ""The only way humans have figured out how to get anywhere is to leave something behind."" In order to increase your ship's velocity, you need to throw something out the back with equal momentum (mass times velocity), typically a fuel that can be conveniently accelerated to high velocity to minimize the amount of mass needed. Because, you see, until we figure out a way to mine fuel in space, you need to bring all the fuel for the entire trip with you from the start. And of course, this fuel increases your mass, and therefore the more fuel you have the more you need to increase your velocity by the same amount, and that extra fuel increases your mass more, and this quickly gets out of hand.  We are working on ways around this, though: ion engines are basically applying as much velocity as they can to very small amounts of fuel, thus lessening the problem that more fuel means more mass. Solar sails, on the other hand, basically cheat their way around the system by just stealing momentum from solar rays."
askscience,3dqy3u,loki130,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:38:22 2015 UTC,"It still takes an obscene amount of energy to accelerate something that is already moving that fast. Since, taken literally from the OP's question, a million mph is about 1/670 the speed of light and therefore not really relativistic, you can use E = 0.5mv2 to figure out the energy you need to impart to the probe to get it to a certain speed. 1 million mph is about 450,000 m/s. So, you can calculate the amount of energy needed to accelerate, say, a 1000 kg probe from 449,000 m/s to 450,000 m/s and you'll find that it's on the order of hundreds of millions of kilojoules. To put that into context, you only get ~620 kJ of energy from burning a mole of hydrazine, a rocket fuel. In other words, you'd need 23 times the mass of the probe in hydrazine just to accelerate the probe from 449,000 m/s to 450,000 m/s even assuming 100% efficiency. And since you're carrying all that extra mass, you'd actually need much, much more fuel because it's not just the mass of the probe you're accelerating! And that's just to get it going faster by 1 m/s."
askscience,3dqy3u,randoguy_16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:06:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, now I'm confused. The idea that accelerating from 449,000 m/s to 450,000 m/s takes more energy than accelerating from 0 m/s to 1,000 m/s violate relativity, because it implies that you have an absolute velocity when in fact you can just take moving at 449 km/s away from wherever you used to be as your reference frame at set it to 0 m/s. Using kinetic energy here is deceptive, and you have to rely on momentum instead (P=mv). I'm not sure why this discrepancy exists, though. It's been a while since kinematics."
askscience,3dqy3u,loki130,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I think you're confusing energy with momentum here. Energy is what we should be looking at here because the argument is that you can't keep accelerating even at non-relativistic speeds because it would take so much energy input. Energy is used to accelerate the object and acceleration, unlike velocity, is absolute. I think that your momentum argument is valid and is just another way of looking at the problem but your interpretation of the energy argument is, respectfully, incorrect.   Energy is related to the capacity to do work. Recall that dW = Fdx. On the other hand, momentum is given by dp = Fdt. Now, dv = adt and from the second law, dv = F/mdt. You're right, going from 0 to 1000 m/s is the same change in velocity, dv, as going from 449,000 m/s to 450,000 m/s. But in this equation, dv = F/mdt, F and m are fixed. Therefore, dt must be the same in each case (going from 0 to 1000 m/s and from 449,000 to 450,000 m/s). That's why your change in momentum is the same in each case, dp = Fdt.   However, energy is different. Energy is related to work - explicitly, it's the capacity to do work. And work is dW = Fdx. Now we've just established that the time to accelerate something from 0 to 1000 m/s is the same as that required to accelerate it from 449,000 to 450,000 m/s. But something moving at 450,000 m/s is moving much faster than something moving at 1000 m/s. Over the time it takes to accelerate that object, then, the object moving at faster speeds has traveled a much greater distance than the same object moving at slower speeds because dt is the same in both cases. In other words, dx(450,000) > dx(1000). And since dW = Fdx, you have to do more work on the faster object to get it to move faster. Doing more work equates to requiring more energy input and so that's how you get my calculations above.   Here's a reddit post about precisely this subject: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/2lepta/why_does_it_take_20x_more_energy_to_accelerate_an/"
askscience,3dqy3u,randoguy_16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think I've figured this out. You're correct that, due to the fact that you're moving faster and cover more distance in the same amount of time, the energy change is different. But you're still applying the same amount of force for the same amount of time, so the fuel requirement is the same. Kinetic energy is only really important if you're going to impact the object you're measuring your velocity relative to. You could just as easily compare yourself to an object moving at the same velocity beside you and your energy would be 0 in that reference frame."
askscience,3dqy3u,loki130,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your argument... The fuel requirement is based on how much work you need to do, not on a change in momentum. Applying the same force for the same amount of time gives you a fixed momentum change. But the force required to effect a change in velocity at high speeds is not the same amount as that required at lower speeds. That's the essence of the work equation. In other words, you're doing more work at higher speeds to get the same change in velocity. Since energy is the capacity to do work, you need to more energy input to get that same dv. Since you need more energy, you need a lot more fuel at high speeds than at low speeds. That fuel is getting converted to work on the probe, which is then stored as kinetic energy by the first law of thermodynamics."
askscience,3dqy3u,randoguy_16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:59 2015 UTC,"Acceleration is directly tied to force (f=ma, as we all know and love). It is independent of velocity. The same amount of force will give you the same acceleration no matter how fast you're going (so long as it's significantly under c). Again, think about relativity: if the force required to do work is tied to velocity, then this implies that there is something fundamentally different about moving at o m/s or 450 km/s. But all velocity is relative.  As for how energy is conserved, keep in mind the fuel you're throwing out the back. If the particles of fuel leave the back of your probe at, choosing a random number, 2,000 m/s, then the energy it's losing (in this reference frame) when you're at 0 m/s and it ends up at -2,000 m/s, is much less then the energy it loses when you're at 450,000 m/s and it ends up at 448,000 m/s. That fuel particle is losing more energy at higher velocity, and you're getting more energy."
askscience,3dqy3u,loki130,2,Sun Jul 19 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, hang on. You're applying a constant force to accelerate something by some fixed amount. Okay. To accelerate something a fixed amount from 0 to 1000 m/s takes the same amount of time to accelerate it from 449,000 ms/ to 450,000 m/s. That's why your change in momentum is the same in each case. However, you're not doing the same amount of work. Work is dW = F*dx. F is the same in both cases as you say. But dx is not the same in each case (if dt is the same in both cases, dx cannot be because one's much faster than the other). Therefore, you're still doing more work to accelerate something moving at high speeds. More work means more energy input required.   I guess I don't understand what point you're trying to make here. It's pretty well established in the physics community that it takes more energy input to accelerate something that's moving really fast already than to accelerate the same thing that's moving slow by the same amount. That's what I tried to show with these equations."
askscience,3dqy3u,randoguy_16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"I think the difference here is whether you're trying to hit a velocity in a time interval or a distance interval. If you send out a rocket that can somehow run forever into deep space, it will get arbitrarily close to the speed of light. It's going to increase its velocity by the same amount every second, at least until we start having to question what a second is due to relativity. Obviously distance intervals do matter quite a bit if you're trying to go to Mars, say."
askscience,3dqy3u,illiterati1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that more energy is required, but that energy change can be done with the same amount of fuel in both cases.

But you're right, blood vessels that are separated by a longer distance will not ""reconnect.""

If it only came from one side and you got a cut, the other side would die. Not ideal. As the wound heals, the body makes numerous new vessels budding off from existing small arteries and veins. There is an excess of new vessels, and they don't have to pair exactly, just hook up with capillaries. Over time the better connections survive and the less optimal regress.  With deep cuts, say from surgery, blood supply is taken into account. Surgery sites are chosen so that there is blood supply from both sides. Problems arise if you place a second incision parallel to another one. The strip of skin in between will likely necrose. Other areas, like the scalp, have minimal supply sources. If you lose one temple artery, the opposite side will take over. This happens fairly often, some people are even born without one side. Now if you don't check for two arteries and cut the only one left, the whole front of the scalp can die.  So there you go. Smaller wounds hook back up just fine, you don't need exactly matching vessels due to excess new vessels and the survival and expansion of the best functioning ones over time. Large wounds with only one source of blood will not reconnect before the tissue dies."

Another difference between WLAN and the others are the protocols used. A protocol can be reffered to a set of rules how different devices speak to each other.

Some changes seem to be pretty common, like the receptor variety that makes cilantro taste like soap. Or being unable to smell skunk spray.  We know that the genes encoding receptors vary, that the expression of receptors vary, so it's safe to assume that taste is unique, even without taking into account everything else that plays into the experience.  Food doesn't taste the same when you have a cold. Fries smell good when you're hungry, but not necessarily when you've eaten way too much already. Hormonal fluctuations and some medications can cause odd changes in taste and smell. Kids have a different constellation of flavor receptors than adults (which is why kids mostly love sickenly sweet things and hate bitter). Even just changing the texture or color of a food can turn it from tasty to revolting.   The emotional states you're in when you eat matters, and what happens right after. If you first encounter durian on holiday with friends your chances to like it are much higher than if someone you don't like forces you to eat it.

Such an observer can measure the local spacetime observables (e.g., the Riemann tensor) diverge as he nears his fate.  Coordinate charts are more effective. They can include a part of spacetime in contact with the singularity and therefore they can ""see it"". However, they also may not. For example, the Schwarzschild chart only maps part of spacetime and fails to get close to the singularity.

Essentially, preoxygenation completely fills the lungs with 100% oxygen (as opposed to the ~20% oxygen in air) so that the person can survive a longer time without breathing.  However, rather than oxygen, our main respiratory drive (the impulse to breathe) comes from our carbon dioxide levels. The respiratory drive in normal people will force them to breathe long before they become hypoxic.  As such, 100% oxygen will most likely not change the duration that someone can voluntarily hold their breath (unless they have chronic CO2 retention, are unconscious, or are under the influence of certain drugs).  Hyperventilation to 'blow off' CO2 is probably the better method to increase the duration you can hold your breath.   In summary, we only need/use the oxygen component of air for respiration, however we do also need to breathe out carbon dioxide. CO2 is the main factor controlling our breathing, so while 100% oxygen will potentially allow you to not breathe for longer, the carbon dioxide levels will will force you to anyway."

askscience,3dpkjq,-Tinusa-,2,Sat Jul 18 05:23:52 2015 UTC,"Very little.  First off, the moon only reflects a small amount of incident light. The ratio of reflected to incident light is the albedo, which is about 0.12 for the moon.  The amount of light from the Sun incident on a celestial object is determined by how far that object is from the Sun, and how large that object is. Since both the Earth and Moon and similar distances from the Sun, let's focus on the latter.   The amount of light incident on a spherical object is proportional to the square of the object's radius.  So the ratio of the light incident on the Moon to the light incident on the Earth is the square of ratio of their radii, which is about 0.075.  Going back to the albedo point, since a fraction of that light incident to the moon is reflected back, we can multiply that result by 0.12 to get an order-of-magnitude comparison to the light from moon vs. the light from the Sun. It ends up being 10-2 . (I'm ignoring the fact that only some of that reflected light from the Moon hits the Earth, so even this is a high-end estimate.)  After accounting for atmospheric effects, etc. the Sun's light heats the Earth up around 20 degrees F on an average day. So in all likelihood the moon's thermal contribution is <1 degree F."

I'm not sure how homeopathy works, but usually the smaller the dose, the smaller the effect - as there will be less of the drug affecting the body and needing to  be excreted.  Perhaps the 'minimum dose' is the lower limit on when it becomes ineffective and/or bad things happen?   There are several drugs that need to have levels kept fairly tightly above a certain level, such as insulin in T1DM, anticoagulation in someone with AF, or anticonvulsants in epilepsy. In those cases, I guess the 'lower limit' would be when they go into DKA, have a stroke, or have a seizure.  Loads of drugs would also be ineffective at lower doses. There's the MIC for antibiotics and therapeutic dose ranges for various drugs, which would essentially just mean that the treatment won't necessarily work.

What OP is asking about would be some sort of reverse hormesis, where a small dose is toxic but a large dose is not (in hormesis, a small dose is beneficial but a large dose is harmful).  Hormesis itself is somewhat controversial, and I'm not aware of any reputed evidence for reverse hormesis (though of course that doesn't mean anything).  e: This book claims that the ""inverted U"" version of hormesis, which is what the OP is asking about, is ""common"" and gives examples"

Anyway, while toxicity is dose-dependent almost by definition, it's essentially just referring to anything causing harmful effects to the organism/cells etc.   So in the case of oxygen, while there's obviously oxygen toxicity (from too much oxygen), indirectly, the various chemicals from anaerobic respiration and/or cell lysis as a result of low oxygen are also 'toxic'.  So strictly speaking, it isn't the low oxygen that is 'toxic', but the lactic acid and free radicals that are released as a result certainly are.

askscience,3dj5oh,thekinglerking,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:04 2015 UTC,You mentioned about fuel here. Does NZ carry any other fuel with it or is it just the gravity assist of Jupiter and RTG's producing electricity which carried it?
askscience,3dj5oh,sublimoon,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:13 2015 UTC,New Horizons has enough fuel to change its speed by about 130 meters per second. The Jupiter gravity assist would have boosted its speed by considerably more than that--about 30-40 times more.
askscience,3dj5oh,MindS1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:04:32 2015 UTC,New Horizon has enough fuel to reach at least another kupier belt object.
askscience,3dj5oh,AsAChemicalEngineer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"If New Horizons had taken a conventional route to Pluto, it would have taken the better part of a century for it to get there. We took a much faster way to get there, which means that as the probe approached Pluto, it was going very, very, very fast. In order to orbit it would have to slow down a ton, which means it would need much, much more fuel than it currently has, which means an even larger launch rocket, which means an even larger price tag. Plus, with New Horizons now drifting off into deep space, we can potentially use it to explore other Kuiper Belt objects as well."
askscience,3dj5oh,AsAChemicalEngineer,29,Thu Jul 16 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"During the press conference with the new Pluto images (which you can see here: http://redd.it/3d9bof, specifically this beauty: https://i.imgur.com/meaqdRP.png) John Spencer talked about how the lack of craters indicated that Pluto's surface must be young and that Pluto must have geologic activity to account for this.    He then said that the surface must be approximately younger than 100 million years. How was this number determined? The New Horizons team had only seen the mosaic for just a few hours, but you already had an estimate on the surface's age. Did you use a crater counting method? Do you know roughly how many impacters object's in Pluto's orbit must deal with?    Also, Charon's youthful appearance was surprising too. Do we know how old Charon is?"
askscience,3dj5oh,milesmobrien,30,Fri Jul 17 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"First, to make it clear, though I was in name a member of the NH imaging team, I have had nothing to do with the flyby, being so absorbed by Cassini.  So, I'm not in the thick of it and am not certain just exactly how things have been calculated/estimated by the team. But here are my guesses.  They may have used cratering rates at Neptune to determine the rates at Pluto.  Of course, that could be fraught with uncertainties, as a body like Neptune can locally increase the cratering rate.   Also, the cratering rate has changed over time.  So it's an uncertain thing, these age determinations.    Regarding Charon's age, that is really uncertain as it was 'born' in the cataclysmic impact that created it and the other moons.  That could be very ancient.  We don't know."

askscience,3dj5oh,TacticusPrime,18,Thu Jul 16 18:27:45 2015 UTC,The Kuiper belt is a rough neighborhood.  Lots of rocks to run into over 4/2 billion years. No doubt Pluto would look like our moon if it didn't have some geologic activity.
askscience,3dj5oh,OverlordQuasar,14,Thu Jul 16 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Kuiper Belt:  1) A region of space covering approx. 20AU  2) Relatively small remnant bodies (small mass)  3) Orbital periodicity / speed and inclination w.r.t. the ecliptic plane (<10km/s which plays a large part with regards to timing)  With these three factors we can note that activity within the Kuiper Belt region must be relatively low.    Regarding the Inner Solar System:  1) A region of space covering approx. 3.2AU  2) Relatively small remnant bodies (asteroids, short term comets, dwarf planets) and the terrestrial planets  3) Orbital periodocity / speed and inclination w.r.t the ecliptic plane (>20km/s, upwards of 50km/s)  4) Perturbations from Jupiter (something the Kuiper Belt lacks)    While the Inner Solar System had a large degree of material accreted early on during the formation of the solar system, it still has a lot of activity, primarily because of (1), (3), and (4). The region is immensely tiny in comparison to the Kuiper Belt (3.2AU vs. 20AU), with much faster orbital speeds and small orbits. This means the probability of experiencing an impact event must be greater than those experienced in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, and it's a big one, Jupiter sends innumerable bodies into the Inner Solar System by perturbing the Asteroid Belt. A simple reflection on how many asteroids impact the Earth and other terrestrial bodies should bode well to persuade anyone that activity within the Inner Solar System should be greater than that which occurs within the Kuiper Belt. Note that the low speeds, orbital inclinations, small size / low mass, and extremely large distances between objects are all unfavorable if you are trying to maintain a higher degree of activity in comparison to the Inner Solar System."

askscience,3dj5oh,FreeSpeechBastion,24,Thu Jul 16 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this question as it gives me the opportunity to mention this.   Back in 2000/2001, I was the Vice-Chair of the first Solar System Decadal Survey run by the National Academy of Sciences and NASA.  A mission to Pluto had been discussed for years before we convened, and it was back and forth: some previous committees endorsed it, others didn't, etc.   We were given the task, among others, of settling the matter on this mission.  What came of our deliberations was that we needed to conduct a mission to the Kuiper Belt -- first and foremost.  Remember, it had just been discovered in the early 1990s, and it was firmly appreciated that this was a region of the solar system that we had to study.  After much wrangling, we gave our strong endorsement to a mission to the Kuiper Belt, with an obvious and first 'stop' at Pluto but to other KBOs as well.  So, NH will not fulfill its charter unless and until it visits other KBOs.  Two possible and smaller KBOs happen to be within reach of NH.  The first, as I understand it, could be visited in 2019.    We must make sure this happens.  After we explore a few KBOs from which to make comparisons, especially if the next ones are smaller and so different in some respect, we can then say we explored the Kuiper Belt.  This is why I don't regard this Pluto flyby as 'the end of an era'. To me, it is 'the beginning of the end'.   We are not done exploring the Kuiper Belt...yet."

I have never had the math (calculus is...weird) to be an astronomer, but have had a fascination with space since I was very young.   Looking back at your career so far: 1) When they launched Cassini, did you expect to find such richness in the Saturn system? I know its closer than Pluto, so we had better resolution images, but its...incredible. 2) We hear a lot about tightness of funding, NASA budget cuts, etc (and we certainly feel them in disease research)- what opportunities have you seen lost because of funding cuts?"
askscience,3dj5oh,TomHicks,25,Thu Jul 16 19:42:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  Remember, Saturn is the most phenomenologically rich planetary system in our solar system.  So, yes, we expected richness and we had come to know it at some level. But Cassini was like getting lasik surgery: those things we had some knowledge of came into much sharper focus (literally) and from that we gained a deeper understanding.  And the questions we had approaching Saturn with Cassini were of a different level:  we had answered all the basic questions with Voyager.  With NH, we are now answering the basics: what size, shape, composition, temperature, thickness of atmosphere etc.   This is reconnaissance.   Its goals are different.  I regret that because of limited budget, we still haven't gone back to Neptune.  And of course, I am part of a small group of scientists planning a mission that we hope gets a go-ahead to go back to Enceladus to find out:  Do those geysers erupt from a body of water with ongoing biological activity?   I hope I live to see an affirmative answer to that question somewhere in our solar system."

REX: (Radio Science EXperiment) Measures atmospheric composition and temperature; passive radiometer.

You can't work alongside scientists from other countries, as I have on Cassini, and come away thinking that YOU are special and different.  True, we Americans, especially those of us living in the 2nd half of the 20th century, have been fortunate to live in a place and time where we have been allowed to conduct a robust scientific enterprise that includes a program to explore the space and worlds around us.  But other countries and regions have been as fortunate in the past, and now many countries around the world are joining the US in this and will be into the future.

But apparently that's not true? What other stuff do we know today about Pluto and friends that we didn't know two weeks ago?"
askscience,3dj5oh,liegeofglory,6,Thu Jul 16 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"First, it's not clear to me that Pluto is bigger.  I don't know if the errors so far assigned to its size are 1 standard deviation (ie, sigma) or 2.  If they are 1sigma, and the same applies to the size of Eris, then I would say the jury is still out because usually in matters like this, scientists quote 2sigma.  And at 2sigma, the sizes of Pluto and Eris are the same.  We expect to see a variation in sizes of objects in a collisional belt like the Kuiper Belt.  The same applies to the asteroid belt.  There are likely many bodies the size of Pluto, and some even bigger yet to be discovered, and there are even more and more bodies as you go to smaller and smaller sizes.  I've read that the estimates are millions for bodies smaller than about 100 km.  [I hope I've remembered that correctly, but let's just say LOTS, and much more than the number of asteroid.]"

I think the most important things to remember here are there are huge mountain ranges made of water ice and there is every reason to believe the planet is geologically active. Taking this one step further: if there is a molten core and tectonic activity, that means there might be someplace where the water ice becomes liquid and forms an aquifer. We know that anywhere we look on Earth and find liquid water, we find life. So when we talk about kicking Pluto off our island in the solar system, let's not forget we might be hurting the feelings of some microscopic Plutonians!"

The visual maximum separation and apparent distance to barycenter, after correcting for oblique viewing angles... all these things would combine to say ""Can't be smaller than X, can't be bigger than Y"".

askscience,3doef7,Predatormagnet,3,Fri Jul 17 22:44:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call pain ""subconscious"". Pain is a very basic perception that works without much processing. Touch a hot stove and your hand will jerk back before your brain is done realizing that you touched something at all.  There are way more elaborate subconscious modules at work. From a specialized area that does face recognition, to the lightning fast processing whether something is dangerous, or another person attractive.  They are connected for one in that the conscious can override the sub-/unconscious sometimes. You can distract yourself from pain with something that utterly captivates your attention. You can consciously revise whether someone is nice after all, even if the first impression was negative. But you can't make yourself not fall for visual illusions. Visual processing, pain, involuntary muscle control, I'd put all those into ""unconscious"" because you can't alter the way they work with a thought, just sometimes ignore them.  And more importantly subconscious modules regularly ""hand"" their results up to the conscious mind for further decision making.  That is their purpose. Subconscious processes are extremely fast and efficient. Not always terribly correct, but not so faulty that they'd become a hindrance for survival.  Conscious thought is slow, elaborate, flexible, and would be utterly overwhelmed with the job of sorting through the piles of information coming in at any point in time. Walking down a path, and consciously thinking ""Hm, long, slender object on the ground ahead... sort through catalog of past experiences... what is that? Stick? Maybe. Snake? Oh, that coloring could fit... what more information do I need to decide?"" will probably get you bitten (if you have capacity left to notice anything on the ground at all and aren't already way too busy sending the right signals to the right muscles at the right time to just stay upright).

askscience,3dnq9k,burf,6,Fri Jul 17 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, but to a much, much lesser extent. The reduction in efficiency mostly comes from the fact that more powerful, higher-torque motors weigh a bit more, and thus induce more rolling friction in the wheels. but this tends to be trivial.  The efficiency of an electric motor tends to be more related to it's shaft speed, rather than power output. If properly designed for the application, they can produce good efficiency at 10% rated torque or 100% torque. Electric motors tend to be vastly more efficient than gasoline or diesels, usually around 85-95%, compared to about 15%-30% for the former.  Increasing the operational range/driving time of an electric car  generally means adding more batteries. But this adds a lot more weight and induces more friction than putting in a more powerful motor, and takes up useful space in the car's cab. Moreover it increases cost.   A driver may not necessarily take advantage of this added capacity, driving a fixed distance to work most days, for example. So the additional stored energy is lost due to self-discharge and due to the added rolling friction.  However, the biggest source of drag on any car, is generally air resistance, so the range and efficiency can be increased significantly by driving at lower speeds. This is true of electric and conventional vehicles.  In general, electric cars are far more energy efficient than internal combustion, and this fact is reflected indirectly, in the low cost of recharging one. A few dollars of electricity, versus 50-80 dollars to fill up a typical tank of gasoline."

You can at least partially make it up by always running the diesel engine at its most efficient speed (since it's not actually coupled to anything but the generator), and the sheer convenience of the setup is generally considered to be worthwhile.  This is especially true since if you used direct drive, due to the low torque on startup you'd need an even bigger diesel engine that would probably use more fuel anyway.    Trains also get a big efficiency boost from the very low rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rail compared to rubber wheels on asphalt."

askscience,3dnq9k,NastyEbilPiwate,2,Sat Jul 18 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally, there is nothing to stop an electric car drivetrain from being exactly 100% efficient. This is the biggest differentiator between combustion and electric: combustion engines are heat engines, and thusly limited by the Carnot cycle efficiency which depends on the difference between combustion temperature and outside temperature. Because the outside never goes below about 250K and combustion with practical fuels stops at something between 500 and 700K, efficiency is fundamentally limited to the low 30% range. Law of nature, nothing you can really do here. Efficiency is not a performance/efficiency tradeoff, it is simply fundamentally limited.  This means that losses in an electric car are all of a practical nature. For instance, it is possible with relatively exotic (but manufacturable with current tech) materials to make 1MW+ electric engines in a weight envelope of order tens of kg. Unfortunately such an engine has to use superconductors, which means it is very impractical. Room-temperature engines are limited by manufacturing tolerances (=cost) and flux linkage limits of ferromagnetic materials as well as losses in the copper windings that need to be cooled, which leads to a performance-efficiency tradeoff. However, for all practical purposes the engines and the driving electronics for them do not have a significant impact on a performance/efficiency tradeoff of the entire car.  As always, it mostly boils down to the electrochemical energy carrier. Batteries are the main driver of every aspect of EV engineering. Even though batteries can be made that have very high power-to-weight ratio, their capacity-to-weight ratio is inferior to other types. As currently manufacturers try to fix the perceived range issues with electric vehicles, high-capacity, low-discharge variants are used with significant safety factors to make sure the battery lasts a long time. This is the major elephant in the room when it comes to EV tradeoffs and the electric machines themselves have comparatively little impact."
askscience,3dnq9k,demultiplexer,0,Sat Jul 18 07:45:01 2015 UTC,Gas currently has much more potential energy per weight than batteries.

So it is done to better measure the outcome of the collision.  There are a few people (mostly theorists) working on so called ""strong field physics"" to calculate how a very strong  field would alter high energy particle collisions. Current accelerators are not affected by that, but already at the currently under construction ""European XFEL"" at DESY, Hamburg one could include a small strong field QED experiment.

It employs a chamber filled with a gas mixture (commonly with a noble gas such as argon/methane) and a bunch of vertical wires under the influence of a strong voltage. As charged particles (or photons) whiz through the chamber perpendicular to the wires, they ionize the gas, whose motion then induces a current through the neighboring wires. With the knowledge of which wires felt a change in current, when, and how much, we can reconstruct a map of the particles' trajectories.

Here's a way to think about what you're describing:  Any time light hits a surface, some amount of the light is reflected off the surface, and some amount penetrates the surface and interacts with whatever is beyond it. You see this all the time with glass surfaces - most of the light penetrates the glass, but you will always see some reflected - around 5-10%, depending on the glass.  So, when you see a ""glossy black"" surface, you're typically seeing something that has a glossy layer on the very top, with something very light-absorbent below. Sometimes these are actually different substances, like when you have black plastic, which is often a transparent plastic resin with particles of carbon suspended in it. Sometimes, it's all one more-or-less homogeneous substance.  So, from some kind of absolutist standpoint, ""glossy black"" substances are actually not black at all - they're more of a dark gray.

In comparison, most of the coastal mountains reach a height of more than 1000 ft, or 300 m.  That's not to say the immediate coastline won't get decimated in the case of a massive tsunami. Seattle is vulnerable with the Puget Sound just to its west; Portland with the Columbia River funneling a tsunami surge right into the city. So it's something we need to be aware of and prepare for. It's definitely something that could cause high-end damage and casualties.  But to say everything west of I-5 is smoked? Hyperbole.  edit: words"
askscience,3dnjll,wxmann,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of an overexaggeration, but one that needed to be done to get people's attention.   A strong tsunami should only reach a few hundred feet inland along a flat coast, depending on topography. Water levels will rise in rivers where the force of the tsunami can push into the stream valleys.  As for the Valley (I5), we will have to worry more about the earthquake than tsunami (impossible where I live). I disagree with /u/mcglaven in that the fault surface rupture will be relatively shallow. I also disagree that this seismic zone should be compared in any way to the strike slip fault of the san andreas.   The force of the earthquake will still be great (remember the chaos following the 6.8 in seattle in the mid 2000's), and may be amplified based on the sediment buildings reside upon.   Finally, the real wildcard that the PNW has that Japan does not is the Farallon plate, an old oceanic plate similar to the Juan De Fuca plate that is currently underneath the northwest region, probably extending out to yellowstone. A slip with the JDF plate may or may not cause some other kind of strain on the Farallon, and who knows what could happen then? I've seen some skeptical reports of magma chambers gathering beneath the plate, ready to seep up to the crust given the opportunity."
askscience,3dnjll,tbw875,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:53 2015 UTC,"That article refers to the Great Tohuku earthquake as a comparison point, to show what a ""Great Cascadia Earthquake"" could be like; however, it's not entirely equivalent. Here's why.   The Great Tohoku earthquake in Japan did by far most of its damage with the tsunami. Damage from the shaking was significant, but not so catastrophic because the slip surface was many tens of kilometers underground, as well as out to sea. Compare to the San Andreas Fault: the San Andreas fault will unleash most of its seismic energy within ten kilometers of Earth’s surface, and maybe underneath cities.  The article's descriptions of destruction from earthquake shaking in the Pacific Northwest seemed a little overblown, and here's why: elastic strain unleashed in the Great Tohoku earthquake took more than a thousand years to accumulate. That is why the Japanese were as unprepared as they were. They were lulled to sleep by the very long time without a monster earthquake. It will take even longer for the Pacific Northwest to accumulate as much elastic strain because the plate convergence rate is slower. The article states that the recurrence rate for great subduction earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest is less than 300 years, but I suspect that such earthquakes are much smaller than the Great Tohoku earthquake. It would take many, many centuries for enough elastic strain to accumulate in the Pacific Northwest so that a Japan-size earthquake would be possible.  Finally, we have a pretty poor idea of when and how big, so caution is advisable – more precautions than have been implemented to date."
askscience,3dmhie,Walfy07,8,Fri Jul 17 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. Because heat is released when a vapor is adsorbed by the adsorbent, heat must then be supplied when the process is reversed. The reason is that enthalpy (or the ""heat content"" of a system) is a so-called state function, which means that it depends only on the state of the system at a given time, and not on the path taken to get from one state to another. A direct consequence of this property is that if the change in enthalpy (the heat released) is dH for the change in state from A -> B, then reversing the change B -> A will cause a change in enthalpy that is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, i.e. -dH. In the case of adsorption/desorption, this change in enthalpy is called the enthalpy of adsorption. This is completely analogous to the enthalpy of vaporization, which is negative when a vapor condenses (indicating that heat is released), but positive when the liquid evaporates (indicating that heat must be supplied)."

If you want a terrible analogy, think of spacetime as a plastic bag: if you put an apple (some matter) into it, you'll change the shape of the bag; put another one in, and the shape of the bag will change again, affecting the position of both apples. However, the apples remain apples and they stay inside the bag.  Let's move on from spacetime though: Quantum Field Theory holds that there are a number of fields that exist throughout spacetime, and that changes to these fields can be thought of as stuff - particles, to be precise.  For instance, there's an electromagnetic field that permeates the Universe; charged particles affect this field, and these changes to the field are what we call photons.  There's a corresponding field for every particle.  As for whether any of this is part of the makeup of consciousness - that's more of a question for philosophy than science."

No one has a supper compelling, perfectly worked out line between the two, but the closest I've seen is somehwere between the Global Workspace Theory and the Re-entry theory.  The tl;dr is that thoughts are very distributed things. That thoughts (maybe) are formed as we take input from lots of unconcious sub-thoughts (short term memory, long term memory, visual perception, etc), throw them all together, and then take the output of that mixing and then throw them into the same subconcious process as new input, and repeat. I like these theories because it is quite in line with what we know of neuroanatomy, and it explains a couple of interesting features of conscious thought, such as how we (usually) experience it as a continuous process, not split or disjointed. And how aspects of one type of input, say a particular smell, can have such wide ranging impacts on lots of other thoughts and behaviors.  As to what thoughts are made of, you are mostly right. Technically, the electrical impluses just travel along individual neurons. For the vast majority of synaptic connections, the neurons rely on releasing chemical neurotransmiters, that then influence the electrical state of the connected neuron. So it alternates chemical/electrical."

We do have some general idea, but that mostly complete answer involves a lot of math. If you are really serious about knowing more or less the state of the art here, I would highly suggest Spikes: Exploring the Neural Code. There have certainly been developments in the last 16 years since the book was written, but they are refinements of the basic hypothesis in Spikes, not revolutionary.  To try and boil the whole thing down is hard, but for a tl;dr I'll try this. What is critical about the information contained in thoughts is not how it is encoded, but what it allows us to differentiate between. There's is nothing intrinsically similar about the form of spoken or written words, but the aspect which gives them their common meaning is the ability to maintain a common differentiation between say, a 'cat' and a 'dog'. If you think first and foremost about differentiation, the problem of the brain and thoughts becomes much more tractable. Now, you don't ask the question, 'how is a series of nerve impulse like the word dog', but instead 'how can a series of nerve impulses differentiate between a dog and a cat'. A modern neuroscientist would argue that once you've answered the second question, that it is also an answer (and the only possible answer) to the first question.

askscience,3dlpcv,Optrode,9,Fri Jul 17 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Ok!  So, one of the first things you learn about when you take an introductory psychology class is (usually) one or more cool / weird syndromes that certain people have exhibited after certain types of brain damage. One common example is what happens when the corpus callosum (connection between cerebral hemispheres) is cut (which is sometimes done as a last ditch treatment for epilepsy that hasn't responded to other treatments and threatens to kill the patient).  People who have had this procedure, if given an object to touch with the left hand (connected to right cerebral hemisphere; note that speech ability is usually localized in left) cannot describe the object, but CAN draw a picture of it (with their left hand). They may even be able to answer somewhat complicated questions about it... So long as the questions are answered via some means that is controlled by the right hemisphere. There is even a recorded instance of a patient's one hand attacking his wife, while the other hand tried to intervene (yes, just like the House episode).   In the face of such evidence that a consciousness could be split in two, it becomes hard to believe that our own conscious awareness means that much. If we could possess a second consciousness, capable of answering questions and making decisions of its own, what else might even our normal brains be doing that we're not aware of?  Other evidence comes from observing the loss of some functions after stroke. For instance, we don't realize that our eyes don't actually see much color in the periphery. Yet, we don't see objects fading towards gray when we look away from them. In fact, the brain is making guesses and assumptions about what color objects are, when it doesn't have them in view of an area with good color vision, and telling us that we see a blue chair. In a sense, our brains lie to us about what we see.   So, what else might they lie about?  Studies have been done in which elite athletes were asked how they performed various movements so effectively. Their answers (""I twist with the left wrist a bit more than the right, and line my arm up with the ball, ..."") were recorded, and then high speed motion video of them performing those motions was analyzed.   And they were completely wrong about what their bodies were doing. And these are professionals! They did not realize, just as most of us do not, that in fact their brains were controlling their movements without much conscious input.  The list of things we think we see, hear, want, decide, or do that our brains lie to us about goes on. And on. We have false ideas about our own preferences, our own motivations... Pretty soon, you start to realize that it's not just your vision and your gait that your brain is handling automatically."

There is certainly plenty of evidence that human without the formation of language have rudimentary thought, but clearly language is required for most higher-order thinking.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought  So, why is that important? Because deep thought or complex thought requires the interactions of many different regions of the brain including the corpus collusum, the frontal lobe, the Wyrnick's area, Broca's area, and many more. But language areas are key in the formation of complex thought. Then there are mood centers, sensory centers, and more. They all interact to create thought, even while asleep in many cases. Looking at thought more broadly, we find that even the concept of thought is absurdly complex and interesting.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_thought  There are philosophies of thought established in the time of the Greeks and carried by philosophers today.

askscience,3dnjin,HighwireAct,6,Fri Jul 17 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"I find working through the levels (and history) from the bottom up a good way of looking at this.  The first computers were programmed by setting a big array of switches. How the switches were set would activate specific circuitry, and the right settings would do an operation like basic arithmetic, or storing and retrieving data. There weren't 'instructions' as we encode them now, just activating or deactivating parts of the computer for that step of the program.  By the 1940's and 50's, computer memory got bigger (and cheaper). Programs could be stored in memory and ran. The common way of getting data into memory then was punched cards. The program would be a series of punched cards with machine code instructions, and the stack would be loaded into memory and then ran. An ""instruction decoder"" in the computer replaced the array of knobs/switches/doodads... given a machine-code instruction, the instruction decoder activates the relevant circuitry to do that instruction, in much the same way that the bunch of switches would have.   Programming like that was a right pain in the ass, and since programmers are lazy sods, took steps to make their job easier. An assembler is a program which reads instructions in a more human-readable form (assembly language), and translates that into machine code, which the instruction decoder can then decode to make the computer do those instructions. Instead of programmers having to make punched-cards with the machine code instruction meaning ""add four to the accumulator"", they could write their code in assembly language as ""ADD A,4"" and the assembler would translate that into ""3E0104"" or whatever. The translation is pretty simple: 1 assembly language instruction is 1 machine code instruction, and it mostly just needs looking up into a table. For ease of programming, the ability to use labels to mark points in the program to read data from (LD A,:table) or jump to (JMP :loop), and the assembler has to compute where these are and replace the labels with the right memory address.  Programming like that was a right pain in the ass, and since programmers are lazy sods, took steps to make their job easier. Assembly languages tended to be specific to the model of computer, so it was hard to use the same code on newer faster computers. Assembly languages were also still hard to program in. So why not go one step further? A compiler is a program which translates from a high(er)-level programming language into a specific computers assembly language. The translation is pretty simple... at least at first: 1 program statement is a list of assembly language statements. The compiler has to figure out how and where to store variables, and has to deal with the issues where there are more variables used in a function than there are registers available on the computer. It gets more complicated when you want to optimise this code to reduce the number of instructions, use less memory and so on.  This essentially gets us up to the late 1950's, early 1960's or so: the first high level languages with compilers. What becomes 'modern' high level languages start here with FORTRAN, COBOL... but start to get recognisable as procedural languages with Algol-60. As each higher level language gets more features, it gets harder to translate to assembly language, and the compiler has to do more and more work. The magic trick is that once you have a compiler for language A, you can use it to write a compiler for a new, more complicated language.  Programmer laziness gets us from ""machine code"", to ""assembly language"", to ""high level languages"". The key to every stage is simply that instructions-are-data, and we can write programs that translate from one kind of data to another, and we can use that to make our lives easier. Over, and over again! :D  (Edit: typos!)"
askscience,3dnjin,SiliconEngineer,3,Sat Jul 18 12:35:14 2015 UTC,"Consider the purpose of a high level language. You would like to write your program in a more human-readable way, but you also want the program to be convertible to assembler so that the CPU knows what you wanted it to do. Equally important; the version the CPU uses has to do exactly the same thing as the version you wrote. In other words, they have to be semantically the same.  I'll go through each step, but this is by no means exhaustive.  Traditionally, HLLs feature a human readable syntax which ultimately compiles into objects in assembly which are then linked into a complete program. Let's talk about those, and not some of the more advanced interpreted stuff that's out there. So in a ""classic"" HLL like C, Pascal, etc you have your initial program which the compiler is asked to compile.  First, the compiler will parse all of what it finds in your source file into tokens, or terminals. In plain English, ""words and things that the compiler knows."" This is formally lexical analysis, or lexing. We need to extract the meaning of each symbol, similar to how you can see a word and know that it's the word ""dog"" instead of ""cat."" Regular expressions are fine for this. See Type-3 of the Chomsky hierarchy.  While it extracts those tokens, (if it were a language like BASIC it they might consist of things like ""print"" ""if"" ""then"" ""goto"" and so on) it feeds them into a more interesting animal called a parser. We can't just throw a bunch of symbols together and make it be a language. We wish to extract grammatically correct sequences of words. The parser uses what is known as a context-free grammar to check to see if the program is syntactically correct. The parser doesn't bother about context in this case; something like:   if (a) { foo(b); }   Would pass in a C compiler, even if a and b were not defined. Checks to see if the variables are defined come after parsing. During or after the parsing phase, provided things are grammatically correct (if they're not, the compiler should output an error) the compiler uses syntax directed translation to create some form of intermediate representation, or IR, based on the code that you wrote. In other words, it makes an internal program that is not in the same language you wrote, but also isn't in assembly: It's in a format that can be easily worked with, analyzed, and so on. Often this starts out as something called an AST, or abstract syntax tree, and later gets turned into a 3-address-code or single static assignment. You can google those if you want to know more about them, suffice it to say that the former is more of a data structure and the latter usually takes the form of a sequence of ""pseudo instructions"" with specific properties. Sometime during this process, the compiler will check the more context-sensitive aspects of your program, such as whether or not you used the correct operations on the right types, whether or not you properly defined things before you used them, and so on.  All of what I've just written above is usually referred to as the front end of a compiler--what people who are new to compilers may often think of when they think of compilation. But there's more.  Now that the compiler has an IR that it can work with, it can perform optimizations. For instance, is there code in your program that is never reached? Dead code elimination can be used to get rid of this, providing a semantically equivalent but smaller program. Maybe you use the same expression of constants (e.g. WIDTH*LENGTH) in your program. Constant-folding will fold those two together and eliminate the mul. Modern compilers have many sophisticated methods to optimize code in various ways.  Finally we have code generation. This is where the final IR form gets turned into an object written in assembly. The compiler's back end has to figure out a way to convert each IR ""instruction"" (or whatever format its IR is in) into assembly instructions. On most CPUs, register-allocation has to be performed. This is where the compiler decides which variables you have in any given block of code get to live inside registers, and which ones have to be stored in memory (usually the stack). Typically the compiler will perform a liveness analysis to see which of your variables are ""alive"" at any particular time, then play musical chairs with the registers to see what the optimal allocation should be. Since we can reduce a bunch of classical NP-Hard problems down to this problem, that means register allocation is NP-Hard, too. So typically an optimization algorithm is applied for some optimal (within a very small margin) register allocation. The reason I bring up register allocation is because I thought it was the most interesting part of code synthesis. Other optimizations can be applied (optimizations specific to the architecture) at the code synthesis stage as well.  Finally, you get an object. Which is the end result of your compiler's work. No program, you say? That is the linker's job (attaching your objects together and creating a binary suitable for use on your machine).  If you really want to know how all of this works, read the Dragon book and the Tiger book. Or better yet take an undergrad compilers course (if you are a CS student, there's no excuse to get a BS in CS without doing this) and you'll almost certainly have one of these two as your textbook."

I might say that, a priori, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed by the earth; but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.""  ""Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.""  ""You know,"" said the stranger, ""that when any luminous rays cross a medium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line; in other words, they undergo refraction. Well! When stars are occulted by the moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the least deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction. It follows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere.""   However, Verne then brought forward a counter-argument so that his characters could breathe when they reached their destination:    ""Let us proceed,"" replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, ""and come to one important fact. A skillful French astronomer, M. Laussedat, in watching the eclipse of July 18, 1860, probed that the horns of the lunar crescent were rounded and truncated. Now, this appearance could only have been produced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing the atmosphere of the moon. There is no other possible explanation of the facts.

Primordial heat   This is, as the name suggests, heat that originated from the time where the planet was formed.

That#s why young planets are molten.   Radioactivity    Radioactive materials emits radiation as it decays. This released energy can't excape since it is surrounded by other stuff, which absorbs the energy and there heats up. There are different materials that are responsible, most importantly Kalium-40 and the isotopes of uranium and thorium.    Friction caused by sinking material   the structure of earth isn't uniform. Denser material still sinks to the center which causes friction and therefore heat.

askscience,3dnj51,myunyulyu,5,Fri Jul 17 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"Could there be a nucleon with a -1 charge?   A nucleon?  Well, no.  Nucleons are definitionally stable components of an atomic nucleus.  The only two such particles are protons and neutrons.  I guess if you relax the definition to include antimatter, then an antiproton would be a an antinucleon with a -1 charge.  But, as you already pointed out in your question, you are not talking about that. :)   Could there be a particle made up of three down quarks for a total charge of -⅓×3 = -1 ?   Yes, there is such a particle!  It belongs to a family of particles called delta baryons.  They are a bit more massive than protons and neutrons, and are thus unstable and therefore decay into protons and neutrons (emitting pions in the process).  Note that it is possible to form an unstable ""nucleus"" involving delta baryons, they are conceptually similar to hyperons I believe, except they don't have any of the 2nd or 3rd generation of quarks, rather it is their spin arrangement (and mass) that distinguishes them from nucleons.  You might be surprised to learn that there are four delta baryons (compared with the two nucleons, protons and neutrons), and the fourth is the opposite of the question you're asking:  it has three up quarks, for a total charge of +2!  And of course its antiparticle has a total charge of -2.  Neat, huh?  Supposedly this observation was a big factor in the development of the quark model.  The reason these combinations don't happen with ordinary nucleons is because ordinary nucleons have their valence quarks' spins aligned counter to eachother (a lower-energy state), while delta baryons have their spins all aligned the same way (a higher-energy, ""excited"" state, essentially).  Each of the three valence quarks has a spin of 1/2; in a nucleon, two spin one way while the other spins oppositely, leading to a total spin (and thus isospin) of 1/2 (so, two isospin projections: +1/2 and -1/2, corresponding to the proton and neutron), while in a delta baryon, all three spin the same way, leading to a total spin (and isospin) of 3/2 (so four isospin projections: +3/2, +1/2, -1/2, and -3/2).  As I understand it, the difference in spin alignment is thought to change the strong interaction dynamics, leading to the observed increase in mass (attributed mostly to the surrounding quark+gluon field).  But AFAIK that's just speculation ... we don't know the details.  How exactly spin is distributed inside baryons is still something of a mystery.  Hope that helps!"

Seems to me like it would be as simple as having one of the quarks switch spin, but surely there's a reason why that can't be.   To be perfectly honest I have wondered this question myself, and done a bit of searching about it in the past, without getting a really convincing answer.  So this morning I did a little more searching and I found an interesting StackExchange answer that seems to give a pretty convincing explanation based around the Pauli exclusion principle.  You may already know this much, but in case you don't:  the Pauli exclusion principle is a quantum-mechanical requirement that the wavefunction for a fermionic particle (half-integer spin) must always be antisymmetric, and therefore multiple such particles cannot occupy the same quantum state.  Since both the individual valence quarks and the whole baryon are fermions, they must all have antisymmetric wavefunctions.  According to that given answer, the quarks inside a baryon have four degrees of freedom: flavor (the type of quark, like up or down); color charge (red, green, or blue); spin projection (+1/2 or -1/2 for quarks, or possibly also +3/2 or -3/2 for the whole baryon); and orbital angular momentum.  The StackExchange answer takes the approach of assuming that the uuu or ddd baryon is a ground state (meaning it's a lowest-energy state; we want to know why it doesn't exist with a spin projection of ±1/2 rather than ±3/2), and then sort of shows a ""proof by contradiction,"" where a spin projection of ±1/2 forces the wavefunction to be symmetric (and thus disallowed by the Pauli exclusion principle):   Flavor:  Since the baryon has all the same type of quark (uuu or ddd), the flavor part of the wavefunction is symmetric; Color:  Since each quark must have a different color, the color part of the wavefunction is antisymmetric; Orbital angular momentum:  Since we assume that it is a ground state, all of the quarks are assumed to have no orbital angular momentum, and therefore the orbital part of the wavefunction is symmetric.   So above, two parts of the wavefunction are symmetric and the last part is antisymmetric.  We know the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, so that means that the only remaining degree of freedom (spin projection) must also be symmetric:  each of the quarks must have the same spin projection.  If they don't, then the spin part of the wavefunction is antisymmetric and the total wavefunction is symmetric, which we can't have due to Pauli exclusion.  So apparently, if you relax the requirement that the baryon is in a ground state, this allows each of the quarks to have orbital angular momentum, which in turn allows for the orbital angular momentum part of the wavefunction to be antisymmetric rather than symmetric.  That means that the spin part can now be antisymmetric too, while keeping the total wavefunction antisymmetric.  Hence it is possible to have a delta baryon with a total spin of ±1/2, but not in a ground state; the ground state is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.  So, the delta baryons with spin of ±1/2 end up being more massive than both the proton and neutron and the other delta baryons that have spin ±3/2.  The proton and neutron each have a mass of roughly 939 MeV, while the spin ±3/2 delta baryons all have a mass of roughly 1,232 MeV.  The spin ±1/2 delta baryons then end up with a mass of roughly 1,620 MeV (or 1,910 MeV for even further-excited states, I believe).  Presumably a lot of this mass comes from the strong interaction dynamics related to the configuration of angular momentum, but I don't think we know that for sure yet, it's just the most viable hypothesis I think.  Like I think I mentioned in my last post, we don't have a reliable idea of how angular momentum is distributed inside of a baryon yet.  Hope that helps!"

Hydro-electric power whether its tidal or from a flowing river doesn't produce nearly as much clean water efficiently as CSP would. There will be a very high investment cost in order to constructed such plants however with the rising prices in fossil fuels they have become more competitive and the longer the CSP plant runs for since most have life-spans of over 25 years the price of produce energy drops exponentially in the future.

A lot of companies do just this.  No processing at the time on their end and it's done way before you even order and it is tailored to you!   The process is so intensive though, that is is almost NEVER done on site.  There are companies that you partner with that scrape your data and prep it for you.  In fact, the images shown are usually not from amazon, ebay, etc, but linked directly to the partner company.  Another example of the trade -- hard drives ARE slow.  RAID slows it down even further (I saw a raid example mentioned -- remember raid is redundancy not performance based and I can go into great lengths to explain why RAID is a performance loss, but it is still needed.  However, there are types of caching mechanisms that only exist in high end server equipment, and believe me, we pay $$$ for them.  There are things like 'flash cache' and 'flash pooling'.   The idea of these technologies is to increase performance by again either pre-fetching data or keeping it much much closer logically and physically to the processor needed for the data.  Oh and one last thing -- despite all the tech that you can buy and implement to speed things up, there are many kinds of disks as well.  Not just your standard spindle disks, but flash disks, SSDs, etc.  Each have their advantages and disadvantages.  In the data center engineering world, you spend a lot of time researching and being presented to.  Companies are hard core into competition to give you the extra 1ms of speed per transaction that makes huge differences over time.  TL; DR:  We have many ways of speeding things up.  They are always expensive but not always needing physical hardware, alot of times ads and data are preprocessed and waiting to be displayed for you."

Modern raid controllers split read and write tasks with multiplexing, and HDDS have such a large amount of cache now that there's rarely a perceivable difference.  The lack of reliability is because of the lack of redundancy, it's splitting the data across two drives instead of mirroring them so if one drive fails all of the data is lost."

askscience,3dp5b0,ReverieWriter,5,Sat Jul 18 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"Back in the day, scientists thought that living and non-living things were made of different stuff. We now know that this is not true - living things on earth are all primarily made of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, and a bunch of other elements in smaller quantities. These include the most common elements in the universe, although the vast majority of the universe is not alive.   Your question is fundamentally about what it means to be alive. This is something that biologists spend some time talking about. There are a few different definitions of ""life"" and there are some things that alas consider to be alive that don't quite fit all of the definitions, and a few things that we don't consider to be alive that fit some of the definitions better than you might expect. Viruses are considered to be living by some biologists, and not living by other biologists.   The definition of life that I think is most useful is that living things consume energy in order to fight entropy - the tendency of all matter to move towards a lower energy state, as described by the laws of thermodynamics. If you have a glass of water that is hotter than the room it's in, the heat will dissipate into the room until they are the same temperature. If the water is colder than the room, the heat in the room will dissipate into the water until they are both the same temperature. Living things fight this tendency in a variety of ways - they maintain ""homeostasis"" in biological terms. Living things control the concentrations of various particles on the inside vs outside of their bodies. They seek out energy-rich molecules to fuel this homeostasis, or they combine lower-energy molecules to produce these high-energy molecules themselves. A famous biologist (Matt Ridley, I believe) once noted that living things are eddies in the stream of entropy.   The ability of living things to fight entropy requires very complex organization of non-living atoms, but the complexity is not in itself what creates life. It would be trivial to imagine a very complex arrangement of atoms that would not result in an organism that could sustain itself in the fight against entropy, particularly given how difficult it can be for organisms to stay alive. The organization of atoms must have functional components that allow it to reverse entropy. We know a lot of the details about how life does this on earth, but there are conceivably other ways of doing it that we are unaware of.   I think one of the best ways to illustrate what makes something alive is to consider what makes a living thing die. All causes of death can be boiled down to the organism being unable to maintain homeostasis, and losing the battle against entropy."

Drones can just as easily be sucked in an engine, but unlike birds, they are usually made of more resilient material and the danger to the engines is higher.  In addition, a high speed collision between a drone and any part of an airplane can cause damage.

askscience,3dmoaj,Conquer98,6,Fri Jul 17 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"Fission weapons work through a nuclear chain reaction, which means that a fissionable material, such as uranium 235, is stored in such a way that the decay of its atoms is subcritical. As a nucleus decays, one of the methods of radioactive decay is to split into two smaller elements and emitting neutrons. The neutrons, being electrically neutral, can penetrate the electromagnetic forces of other atoms and strike the nucleus. This can in turn cause that nucleus to decay, emitting its own set of daughter elements and neutrons. If the reaction happens at a rate slow enough that the neutrons die off without multiplying at an increasing rate, the reaction is subcritical.  You can see that if you pack the atoms closely enough, you can start a chain reaction where the decay of atoms causes neutrons to strike more atoms, which decay and cause neutrons to strike still more atoms. If this happens at an increasing rate over time, the reaction becomes supercritical. Nuclear fission weapons operate simply in concept: take a subcritical geometry of a radioactive element and cram it into a small enough space for it to become supercritical. The runaway chain reaction causes a very large explosion.  The radioactive material is generally isolated in one of two ways: use a very precisely constructed series of filters, where the filter holes are just the right size to separate the stable isotope (e.g. U-238) from the unstable one (U-235). The difference in neutrons for these two elements causes the elements (or a molecule formed from these elements) to have slightly different sizes. Additionally, the elements have slightly different masses, which was used in the first refining process: create a large electromagnet and use it to bend a moving stream of gaseous uranium around a corner. The heaver mass of the larger isotope causes that isotope to be bent less easily, so the radially nearer isotopes will be a higher proportion of U-235 than the further isotopes. In either case, these methods are repeated over and over again to enrich the proportion of fissile material until you have a weapons-grade body of fissile material.  It's entirely possible to create a fairly clean nuclear explosion, where the radioactive element is calculated to be almost completely consumed in the reaction. The trick is to contain the explosion in a small enough area for long enough that all of the fissile material and its radioactive daughter elements are completely consumed before the bomb explodes and flies apart, scattering the daughter elements across the blast zone. In practice, this is difficult to perform perfectly, but modern nuclear warheads attempt to maximize destruction while minimizing radiation.  In addition, some of the worst nuclear attacks can use a bomb laced with radioactive cobalt-60 (or equivalent) to create a dirty bomb, which is intentionally constructed to maximize the radioactivity after explosion. The lacing element is selected to be radioactive enough to be hazardous while long-lived enough to stick around. Understandably, these have never been used in war and are rarely, if ever, tested.  All of this is for fission bombs. Fusion bombs use a fission bomb to create the right conditions for a fusion reaction, where a lighter element is fused into heavier elements. This reaction releases even more energy, and boosts the yield by a considerable amount. Modern bombs tend to be hybrids: a mostly fission reaction with a fusion-like boosting of the explosion, as the amount of fusion can be easily controlled by adding or removing fusible material, which allows the bomb's yield to be precisely controlled for a large or a smaller blast."

This video from Periodic Videos should give more information."
askscience,3dmoaj,Duvelthehobbit,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"Since nobody's covered it in detail yet, I'll discuss refinement of nuclear fuel. The most common process (at least for uranium, by far the most common type of nuclear fuel) uses centrifuges. Unrefined uranium (which is extracted from ore like other naturally-occurring metals) is processed into a gaseous form and then spun in centrifuges. Uranium-235, the more fissionable isotope of uranium, is less massive than Uranium-238, and tends to stay nearer the center of the centrifuge. This less-massive component is then piped off into another centrifuge and refined further. This process is repeated until the desired concentration of U-235 is achieved. The gas is then reprocessed into a solid, usable form. The final product is referred to as 'enriched uranium.'  Highly-concentrated U-235 is called ""weapons-grade uranium,' and used in nuclear weapons (although not always directly. Modern nuclear weapons typically use Plutonium, which does not occur naturally and instead must be created through nuclear reactions. Weapons-grade uranium is the starting material from which plutonium is created). Less-highly concentrated U-235 is used in civilian power plants. The leftovers from the refinement process are processed into what is referred to as ""depleted uranium,"" metallic uranium with a very low U-235 content (useful in armor, kinetic projectiles, and other applications where uranium's hardness and density are desired but radioactivity and fissionability are not).  For non-Uranium metals, cyclotrons and other methods are sometimes used, but centrifugal refinement is by far the most common source of usable fissionable material."
askscience,3dntml,Rectangle91,9,Fri Jul 17 19:59:02 2015 UTC,"In statistics, there is a very precise notion of a ""confidence interval"". This notion is as counterintuitive as it is unhelpful when it comes to communicating statistics to the lay public.  As a result, language involving confidence intervals and % confidence often gets repeated without understanding, and distorted in the process. So, depending on where ""95% confident in a result"" shows up, it could mean a lot of different things. In mass media, who knows. In scientific literature, you can usually assume that the scientists used it correctly (but even this isn't always true, because the notion is counterintuitive to the point of commonly confusing even scientists, unless they are more training in vagaries of statistics than many do).  In its precise statistical meaning, the notion of ""95% confidence"" is definitely not the same as ""95% likely to be true"". As a result, odds are that whether this shows up in its precise statistical sense, or in some distorted-through-misunderstanding sense, ""95% confidence"" does not mean ""95% likely to be true"".  And to answer the inevitable question about what 95% confidence means statistically in a way that I think is helpful to a general audience, the answer is that being 95% confident in the result of an experiment (or a study) means that if the experiment / study is repeated (with a different selection of subjects, whatever that means in the context of the study), you'd expect 95% of the repetitions of the experiment to yield the same result.  For example, if I check resting heart rates of 1000 athletes against resting heart rates of 1000 non-athletes and find with 95% confidence that athletes' heart rates are lower, that means that if I repeat the experiment with 99 other groups of 1000 athletes and 1000 non-athletes, I would expect ~95 of those 100 experiments to yield the same finding (that is, that athletes' heart rates are lower).   The difference between that and the result being 95% likely to be true is that 95% confidence is a statement about experiments about something, and likelihood-to-be-true is a statement about that something. And in ways that are beyond the scope of my leisurely evening, those two aren't the same.  But if you would like to read more about this (ranging from casual to highly technical), look up ""criticism of confidence intervals""."

I can construct a 95% confidence interval as follows:   1) Take a biased coin -- one that return heads 95% of the time. 2) Flip the coin 3) If it returns heads, my interval contains every real number. If it returns tails, the interval contains nothing.   Suppose that we flip a coin and get tails -- the result is an (empty) 95% confidence interval, but there is a 0% chance that it contains the true average heart rate."

This is a start but not quite right. You expect that in 95% of repetitions of your experiment, your CI captures the true unknown value, but not that the experiments would yield the same result 95% of the time. How often the experiments yield the same result (in the sense of reject/fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 95% level) is the power of the experiment at the true value.  Using your athlete heart rate example, in a world where the null holds and there is no difference between athletes and non-athletes, hypothesis testing is designed so that you will falsely say there is a difference in only 5% of replications (type I error rate), and 95% of your CIs will contain zero.  When the null doesn't hold, all bets are off. If the true difference between athletes and non-athletes is not zero but small, you'll reject the null hypothesis more than 5% of the time, but not necessarily anywhere near 95% -- perhaps more like 20% of the time with a low-power study. It would still be the case that 95% of our CIs would contain the true small value, but most of them still overlap with zero and it's hard to tell if anything is going on from a single experiment.  If the true difference between athletes and non-athletes is very large (or not very large but we have a big sample), we might reject the null hypothesis close to 100% of the time. Though practically none of our CIs will overlap with zero, only 95% of them will actually contain the true large effect."

In frequentist statistics, the true value of something you are estimating is fixed (albeit unknown) so it doesn't make sense to assign a probability for it to be in a certain range. The 95% means that 95% of the time you make a 95% confidence interval (i.e. with a series of experiments), it'll contain the true value.  In Bayesian statistics, there isn't a fixed true value, but the estimated quantity is drawn from a probability distribution: in this case you need use Bayes' law to invert the probability statement about the interval to one about the value. Having 95% confidence in something with a very low prior probability will result in a still somewhat low postierior probability.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Meaning_and_interpretation"

The uranium and thorium in the earth has been undergoing alpha decay for billions of years and collected underground in the same place where natural gas deposits are.  The natural gas extracted from the ground contains a good percentage (some up to 10%) helium.    And the early experiments which found helium did so from the alpha particles from radioactive decay which gained electrons and were collected.  Now is this viable for large quantities?  No.  Any naturally decaying element will either be too long lived or too low in abundance to collect enough helium.  Also let's look at the energy emitted by the decay.  It is going to be around 1 MeV/alpha particle.  If you want 1 liter of liquid helium per day, you'll need 2 x 1025 He atoms.  Meaning 3 x 1012 Joules or 800,000 kWh of energy will be emitted.

Of course, if you're using this steel wall to prevent two magnets from attracting to one another, you'll still have to deal with how they want to attract to the wall!  More info."
askscience,3dmta3,kjmagnetics,2,Fri Jul 17 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"Any magnetic shielding material should block the magnet attraction placed between, depending on the thickness of the material and the strength of the magnets. Just look up magnetic shielding and shop around for materials that suit your purposes. If you have questions about whether or not the material will block the magnets for you, ask for the magnetic permeability. Generally speaking the higher the number the better if I remember correctly. Here is a link for a little more information:  http://www.magnetic-shield.com/pdf/how_do_magnetic_shields_work.pdf"
askscience,3dmta3,ElectricAccordian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"short answer is yes.   basically a magnetic field is just the effect of electrons in motion. so an electrical field can reshape a magnetic field, this includes materials with the right numbers of electrons to make them magnetically active (ferrous) materials. so iron, and most other things that are capable of being magnets and there is no doubt a way to do it electrically as well.  if you take apart a computer hard drive the arm that rides over the disks to read/write information is driven by a coil placed between two very powerful permanent magnets. but because the disks are very sensitive to magnetic fields themselves, those magnets must be shielded, so if you have a junk hard drive take it apart to see the shielded magnets. they are very effectively shielded."
askscience,3dgt1f,ToucanbT,5060,Thu Jul 16 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"Repost of my answer from when this question was asked before:  For the interior of Jupiter, let's imagine taking a descent from cloud-tops down to the core based on our best guesses of what lies below.  You start falling through the high, white ammonia clouds starting at 0.5 atmospheres, where the Sun is still visible. It's very cold here, -150 C (-240 F). Your rate of descent is roughly 2.5x that of Earth, since gravity is much stronger on Jupiter.  You emerge out the bottom of the cloud deck somewhere near 1 atmosphere. It's still somewhat bright, with sunlight filtering through the ammonia clouds much like an overcast day on Earth. Below, you see the second cloud-deck made of roiling brown ammonium hydrosulphide, starting about 2 atmospheres.  As you fall through the bottom of this second cloud deck, it's now quite dark, but warming up as the pressure increases. Beneath you are white water clouds forming towering thunderstorms, with the darkness punctuated by bright flashes of lightning starting somewhere around 5 atmospheres. As you pass through this third and final cloud-deck it's now finally warmed up to room temperature, if only the pressure weren't starting to crush you.  Emerging out the bottom, the pressure is now intense, and it's starting to get quite warm, and there's nothing but the dark abyss of ever-denser hydrogen gas beneath you. You fall through this abyss for a very, very long time.  You eventually start to notice that the atmosphere has become thick enough that you can swim through it. It's not quite liquid, not quite gas, but a ""supercritical fluid"" that shares properties of each. Your body would naturally stop falling and settle out somewhere at this level, where your density and the atmosphere's density are equal. However, you've brought your ""heavy boots"" and continue your descent.  After a very, very long time of falling through ever greater pressure and heat, there's no longer complete darkness. The atmosphere is now warm enough that it begins to glow - red-hot at first, then yellow-hot, and finally white-hot.  You're now 30% of the way down, and have just hit the metallic region at 2 million atmospheres of pressure. Still glowing white-hot, hydrogen has become so dense as to become a liquid metal. It roils and convects, generating strong magnetic fields in the process.  Most materials passing through this deep, deep ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen would instantly dissolve, but thankfully you've brought your unobtainium spacesuit...which is good, because it's now 10,000 C (18,000 F). Falling ever deeper through this hot glowing sea of liquid metal, you reflect that a mai tai would really hit the spot right about now.  After a very, very, very long time falling through this liquid metal ocean, you're now 80% of the way down...when suddenly your boots hit a solid ""surface"", insomuch as you can call it a surface. Beneath you is a core weighing in at 25 Earth-masses, made of rock and exotic ices that can only exist under the crushing pressure of 25 million atmospheres.  You check your cell phone to tell you friends about your voyage...but sadly, it melted in the metallic ocean - and besides, they only have 3G down here.  TL;DR: You would stop falling about 10% of the way down, where your density matches the density of the surrounding hydrogen ""supercritical fluid""."

askscience,3dgt1f,BadgerDancer,104,Thu Jul 16 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"To scientists, one of the more fascinating findings to emerge from this well is that no transition from granite to basalt was found at the depth of about 7 km, where the velocity of seismic waves has a discontinuity. Instead the change in the seismic wave velocity is caused by a metamorphic transition in the granite rock. In addition, the rock at that depth had been thoroughly fractured and was saturated with water, which was surprising. This water, unlike surface water, must have come from deep-crust minerals and had been unable to reach the surface because of a layer of impermeable rock.[8]   From /u/BadgerDancer's link above  This is a great example of what you are talking about, and of the pros/cons. Seismic waves identified a boundary, but the exact details were different than expected.  P and S waves are pressure/compression (like a spring) waves and shear waves (like in the ocean), and each is affected differently by different rocks, layers, etc. In the end, as with much high level science, it all comes down to a bunch of math. Different waves on different paths give you more data points and equations, but there is always the possibility of a solution to all that mess that no one has thought of yet."

askscience,3dgt1f,Exaskryz,16,Thu Jul 16 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're exactly right. That's actually how oil is found. I used to work in the oil exploration industry and we used seismographs to look for oil, only we didn't just wait for an earthquake. It's way more complex than what I'm about to say, but I'll try to keep it short. We used either dynamite that a hole was drilled at a specific depth for with a detonator fuse to the ground was left for, or a seismograph truck which would usually line up in a configuration of 3-4 and shake the ground at a very specific frequency and duration.   Essentially, the waves pass through the ground and bounce back up at a different frequency depending on what type of substance they hit, and depending on how long it takes for the signal to bounce back up you're able to determine how far down that substance is. Rock gives off a certain wavelength, air in caverns gives off a different wave, water another different one, and of course oil is different also.  You set up your geophones (the things that pick up the vibrations) in a grid that's basically broken up lines that go back and forth but end up in a square. I'm sorry, it's hard to explain. So imagine looking down at the ground from Google Maps and seeing a square grid of these geophones running in vertical lines. Now either with the dynamite or seismic trucks mentioned above you shake the ground in the opposite way that the geophones are laid out. You now have a sort of 3d model of what's exactly below you and how deep. You know based off the seismic data that you have oil beginning at x amount of meters down and continues another x amount of meters. This also allows you to see where the most optimal location to drill for the oil would be based on the shortest path to the oil and the deepest part of the well."
askscience,3dgt1f,Kovis,2,Thu Jul 16 15:23:05 2015 UTC,One minor correction: ocean waves are more like surface waves which also occur in solids and tend to move much slower than either the P or S wave.  Interestingly though the S wave cannot go through the center of the earth and this is how we know that there are fluid layers in there.  The sheer component measured when a wave traverses the mantle is due to mode conversion at the interface. This mode conversion is how we can calculate that the core is solid again.

If you then take careful measurements of what the Xrays ""pattern"" looks like on the other side of your body, you can tell a lot about what it must have gone through.

Heat causes molecules to ""want"" to move around more and pressure prevents them from moving around, so it's kinda a battle between the two. And when you start dealing with pressures found inside planets they are so high that you'd need an unimaginable source of heat (such as fusion) to push those molecules back apart."

That estimate was based on some old nuclear physics (like 1980’s old).  By being awesome, and building neutrino detectors and big computers, we’ve managed to refine our understanding of stellar fusion a lot in the last few decades.  Although the material involved (how much hydrogen, how much helium, etc.) can change the details, most physicists (who work on this stuff) estimate that you’d need at least 75-85 Jupiter masses to get fusion started.  By the time a planet is that large the lines between planet, brown dwarf (failed star), and star gets a little fuzzy.  So, for Jupiter to become a star you’d need to slam so much additional mass into it, that it would be more like Jupiter slamming into the additional mass.

Does that mean in a gravitational sense, in that our orbit would not be directly impacted? Heat-wise?  In fact, with more than 85 additional Jupiter Masses, what would that do to our star? Would its orbit be changed dramatically, or would the smallest possible star simply orbit around it like any other planet?"
askscience,3dgt1f,Vox_R,9,Thu Jul 16 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"The Sun is roughly 1000x the mass of Jupiter. Even if Jupiter was 100x larger, it'd still be dominated by Sol. There's two big concerns - light and gravity.   Light-wise, the Sun has an absolute magnitude of 4.83, and the dimmest stars are around +17(an increase of 5 means 1/100th the light, for annoying historical reasons). We'll say Mega-Jupiter is 14.83, or exactly 10 points higher. This means it produces 1/10,000 the light. Jupiter is also between 4-6.5x further away, which by the inverse square law means it'd be 1/16-1/42 as bright visually as it would be in absolute terms. So even at its closest approach, Jupiter would be 1/160,000 as bright as the Sun. For comparison, that'd be slightly brighter than the Moon. It'd dominate the night sky, but it'd be nowhere near solar.   Gravitationally, a simple two-body system rotates about its centre of mass. The other planets could be ignored(even Saturn is a gnat in this system), so this approximation would hold well enough. Right now, the centre of gravity is low in the Sun's atmosphere, but with this it'd be 100x further away, or between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Jupiter's orbit wouldn't change too much(it'd get more eccentric, but it's far enough from anything of size that that wouldn't matter, aside from agitating the asteroids). The Sun would also be orbiting this point, though, and that'd lead to chaos. Mercury and Venus would be swallowed within a few months, depending on exact orbital positions. The Earth would not, strictly speaking, be within the Sun's orbit, but it'd be far too close for comfort. At best, we'd have major seasonal variation caused by orbital eccentricity instead of axial tilt, which would probably lead to some truly scary weather. At worst, we get closer than Mercury is, and even if it only lasted a week or two per orbit, it'd blast the surface clean. Then we spend most of the orbit out around Mars freezing to death. Humanity could in principle survive, but it'd be a very small number of us.   I originally thought it wouldn't matter too much, but I was wrong. The wobble of the Sun would be cataclysmic."
askscience,3dgt1f,Alsadius,10,Thu Jul 16 16:15:54 2015 UTC,"I think the word ""ignite"" is actually very misleading here. With ordinary fuels, it means heating to the point where an oxidation reaction occurs which is sufficiently exothermic to keep the reaction going until the fuel runs out.  With nuclear fusion, heat alone is not enough to sustain the reaction: you need to smash atoms together with enough energy to get them to fuse, sure, but you also need to smash them together repeatedly for which you need sufficient density. The problem is that ordinarily if you start a nuclear reaction like with a bomb, what you get is an explosion - something that blasts stuff apart, rather than smashes it together.  The reason a star sustains the nuclear reaction is that its great gravity squashes all the matter together into a hot, dense sphere, which is what you need."

Lowering the temperature of water isn't the only way to make ice, though. You can also make ice if you raise the pressure a lot, although it has different crystal phases than what we're used to.   Regular ice makes hexagonal crystals (that's why snowflakes are six-sided) and has a lower density than liquid water (that's why ice cubes float to the top of your drink). However, there are at least 17 other phases of ice that we never really encounter in our day-to-day lives - they form under very specific temperatures and pressures. Some of these phases are denser than water so they would sink, some form cubic crystals, some are more like glass.  So the core of Jupiter probably has a lot of very hot, very high pressure ice. Also note that so far we've only just been talking about water ice. The core of Jupiter likely has a good deal of exotic ammonia ice, exotic methane ice, etc."

For instance, on Earth we have nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere, but ice or liquid water in the clouds. The atmosphere also contains some water vapor (an invisible gas). As the atmosphere rises, it expands and cools, until it's cold enough that the water vapor condenses out into clouds. Above that, the atmosphere is very dry since the water vapor can't get that high without turning into clouds.  The same thing happens on Jupiter. The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium throughout, with some ammonia vapor. At a certain height it's cold enough for ammonia clouds to form, and above that the atmosphere has very little ammonia vapor. Same goes for the ammonium hydrosulphide middle cloud deck, as well as the water lower clouds deck.

The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003, at a speed of over 50 km/s, to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa—a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life."

askscience,3dgt1f,Astromike23,6,Thu Jul 16 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"I think the part we have trouble imagining is the supercritical fluid thing. We know what a gas is like (air or mist), we know what a body of liquid is like (water)...but the idea of a mist so thick, so dense, under such pressure that it becomes liquidy (at least in the sense that a human body might ""float"" at the point where densities match) is foreign to our imaginations, especially since the transition is gradual not abrupt."

Eventually you'd slow down, bob up and down a bit, and then come to a stop in the region where the surrounding material is the same density as you. This is essentially what zeppelins do here on Earth, it's just that you (and your suit, and whatever air your suit contained) would be playing the part of the zeppelin.  Note that you'd need a really tough, rigid suit. The pressure in that region is pretty high and would crush an unprotected human body."
askscience,3dgt1f,green_meklar,19,Thu Jul 16 08:04:45 2015 UTC,"You'd die from radiation long before you reached the planet. If you fell in at speed you'd just burn up. If you fell in slowly enough, and were immune to radiation, you'd vaporize by the heat - it may not be dense enough to be a star, but it still outputs more energy than it receives from the sun. You'd fry quickly.   But, if you had the same density and composition as a human being and you fell in at a good speed, being slowed down by rockets or a parachute or something and you had some sort of magical heat shield... You would get to a certain level in the clouds and you'd be buoyant.  You'd just float at a certain point. It'd be chaotic around you, winds without a surface to slow them down are very fast and violent. But there would be a point where the gas/liquid/plasma around you is the same density as a human body and you'd float.  You could probably kick to swim down or up a bit in either direction, but you'd slowly go back to your perfectly buoyant level.    The question I think you're asking is if there's a ""crust"" on a gas giant. No. There isn't. BUT the density of the gasses do eventually compress to liquids. And you have to think - the same stuff that went into the Earth's formation went into the Gas Giant's formation - so there's still iron at the core along with the heavy metals - they're just kept liquid from the massive heat and pressure.  That same pressure and heat keeps a ""crust"" from forming at any defined ""surface"". They say that Saturn would 'float' in water. Well that's only true because the area of Saturn is so high - when you get passed the clouds, there's still very dense and hot liquid metals.    Think of it like one of those cylinders of increasingly dense liquids. Add to that a bunch more layers including gasses and dense liquid metals and you get an idea of what a gas giant looks like on the inside. But since it's so windy and turbulent, the layers are inter-mixed and fuzzy - but there isn't much liquid iron at the top of the hydrogen gas clouds, and there isn't much gaseous hydrogen in the liquid iron layer."
askscience,3dgt1f,Valendr0s,3,Thu Jul 16 13:13:40 2015 UTC,This question gets asked so often. No you would float or swim in the dense air the closer you get to the center.

There is no defined surface, only progressively thicker gas layers over the core."
askscience,3dgt1f,sixthsheik,18,Thu Jul 16 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"The same thing that would happen to you if you stepped out of a high altitude ballon from the upper level's of the Earth's atmosphere.  Air won't stop you from being pulled down by the planet's gravity, so you would immediately start falling.  You would reach terminal velocity for the type of atmosphere you're falling through, and you would continue until you reached whatever is in the center.  For Earth the hard surface will stop you instantly when you reach it.  Even if you landed in water, at that speed it would be no different than hitting dirt.  We have theories about what is inside the gas giants in our solar system.  It could be a sea of liquid hydrogen that stops your fall on Jupiter or Saturn, or possibly even a form of metalic hydrogen that only exists at incredibly high pressures.  Uranus and Neptune might have a solid ice core that will stop you like hitting the ground on Earth, or maybe they have liquid hydrocarbons over the ice core like the ones we've seen on Saturn's moon, Titan.  For Jupiter and Saturn you will die long before you reach whatever is in the center.  The atmospheric pressure at that depth will crush you to death.  Unfortunately we still really don't know what is in their cores.  It will take engineering that is beyond our current ability to design a probe that could survive the fall and transmit its findings back out."

For Jupiter and Saturn, you'd never reach the center. You'd stop falling when the density of the surrounding hydrogen matches your own density, somewhere around 10% of the way down.   Uranus and Neptune might have a solid ice core that will stop you like hitting the ground on Earth, or maybe they have liquid hydrocarbons over the ice core like the ones we've seen on Saturn's moon, Titan.   Not sure where you're getting this from. The current working hypothesis is that Uranus and Neptune have an ocean mantle of slushy, superionic water maybe ~20% of the way down. Much further down, there are presumed to be cores of solid rock and ice.   Unfortunately we still really don't know what is in their cores. It will take engineering that is beyond our current ability to design a probe that could survive the fall and transmit its findings back out.   We'll actually probably have a much more definitive answer to this next year. The Juno spacecraft arrives at Jupiter in August 2016, taking very tight orbits around the planet. As we carefully observe how its orbit changes, we can map out the higher order moments of its gravitational field, allowing us to remotely observe the nature of Jupiter's core."

That being said, this ""prediction"" is (as mentioned above) based upon the AVERAGE time between occurrences of events recorded in geological coring samples.

Earthquakes have no identified cycle, as in every X amount of years.  But what is generally accepted is, the longer the time between earthquakes the more powerful they become.  As one of the articles I read stated, the average of 2+18=10, but so does 9+11.  An earthquake is a release of built up pressure, so the longer you have without that release the more energy and pressure build.  So on the San Andreas in California its great news when you have all those minor earthquakes, they relieve the pressure and make a ""big one"" less likely."

askscience,3djrin,Blaze7010,26,Sat Jul 18 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"Popular opinion might say otherwise, but drinking mercury would not kill you. Before its toxicity was determined scientifically, people used to drink mercury, thinking it would produce miraculous results. Of course, it did no such thing. But it's very, very hard to kill someone this way; even to get mercury poisoning this way it would require some persistence and planning. Robert Hooke, Newton's contemporary and a great scientist, eventually did get mercury poisoning, but only after drinking the element often for a long time (and handling it in various ways that today would be deemed unsafe).  There's a very good chance that drinking some amount of mercury only once would not even give you any symptoms of mercury poisoning. In its pure form it's quite non-reactive. It would pass through the intestine and come out the other side.  Mercury is very toxic as a water-soluble compound - e.g. as mercury chloride, which is a powerful poison. It is less toxic as vapors - it gets absorbed into the lungs quite readily this way, but it's pretty hard to obtain dangerous levels of concentration in the air. Finally, in its pure metal form it's not a great danger, mostly because it's not very reactive. It would only be a problem if you spilled a significant amount all over the floor in a room where you spend a lot of time daily - it would vaporize, you would inhale it, and after a while you may get the symptoms of mercury poisoning.  If you do spill mercury all over the floor, hopefully you have some sulfur powder ready. If you sprinkle it in all places where the metal might be, it binds the mercury, reacting with it fairly quickly, and forms a stable compound which is quite safe to handle.  That being said, do not drink mercury. Even if chances are pretty low that something bad would happen, those chances are not zero. It's essentially a poison, even when it's in metallic form."

The deepest scuba dive ever was to 332 meters, giving a pressure of at least 33 bars that a human being can survive without a pressure suit. At that pressure, xenon has a boiling point of about -10 C, which is cold but probably not dangerous. This means that you could probably drink liquid xenon in a pressure vessel. At those pressures, you would need to breath a special combination of gases and depressurize for hours before you could leave, but it's better than trying to drink liquid Xe at -112 C at atmospheric pressure.   After drinking, it would boil at your body temperature, but if you drank it in small enough quantities that could probably be burped out instead of rupturing your stomach.   Since xenon is a noble gas, it will not react with anything else in your body. However, you have to be careful not to breathe it in after it boils, since it is more dense than air. This means it can pool in your lungs and you won't be able to breath it out, eventually suffocating. You can save yourself in this situation by hanging upside down so it sinks out.

The amount of energy released in each quake is easily measured by the amount of damage left behind in geological, and archeological records. So we can base the estimated damages on these records, and the results are rather scary, hence our current hype train scenario.  Because of the scale of the area that is able to be affected (It's not just the Pacific Northwest that will suffer the consequences if this were to happen today) very little preventative measures have been implemented. And compared to where scientists would prefer us to be, we've practically done nothing in terms of establishing evacuation routes and methods to move the population away from the ocean within just a few minutes of detecting the quake.

How do all those protons stay confined to the very small space of the nucleus? It turns out that there is an additional force at work, a force that we can't experience because it only has about the range of a lead nucleus. The Strong Nuclear Force is a force that works on quarks, the things that protons and neutrons are made of, and this force holds protons and neutrons together. But if we had just 12 protons in the nucleus of an atom, then the electric force might still be able to push some protons out, so neutrons are also in there to increase the binding power of the protons to the nucleus.

askscience,3dm0zh,pushing1,7,Fri Jul 17 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"One of the advantages of thorium reactors is that thorium does not make bombs.  Thorium reactors though are breeder reactor making U-233 from thorium through neutron capture that then breaks up giving the energy that the reactor uses to produce power.  Thorium itself is not fissile and this conversion is a required step to produce power.  The produced U-233 can be used in bombs, not the standard isotope but a usuable one.  but U-232 that is also produced is not suitable for bombs and the U-232 and U-233 that arises cannot be chemically separated and there is no use for uranium isotope separation in common thorium reactors models.  So if someone with a thorium reactor starts to build isotope separators you get a pretty good idea of what they are up to.  But the U-233 goes through a step in the fuel chain as protactinium-233 which can be separated chemically, and has a halflife of 26.9days so there is time to do the separation in.  So to make bombs from a thorium reactor your start with thorium, get a neutron source like plutonium or uranium to start the fuel cycle, let the reactor produce power like normal for a while.  Then you take out a chunk of the fuel, chemically separate the protactinium, wait for it to become U-233 and build a bomb from that.  This separation stage is not required for regular operation unlike the isotopic enrichment required for U and Pu reactors that can be used to make either fuel or bombs depending on how far the enrichment goes.  So thorium reactors are more bomb resistant than proof, and since the technology required to build the bombs is not part of the regular process it can be monitored for.  One of the big reasons preventing their use anywhere is there are currently no proven designs.   Research and development is still underway to get a cost competitive thorium reactor built."
askscience,3dlsia,pomaranc,15,Fri Jul 17 08:35:32 2015 UTC,"You'll need to clarify what you mean when you say ""heat resistant."" If you mean literal thermal resistance, then the material with the lowest thermal conductivity that doesn't use a vacuum of some sort is silica aerogel. Technically, a perfect vacuum would have the lowest thermal conductivity of zero, and there are applications that use vacuums to achieve lower conductivities than aerogel, but that's not achieved by the material properties alone.  If you mean the material most resistant to degrading under high temperatures, that's a more complicated question. The metal with the highest melting point is tungsten (3400 C), but it is beat out by elemental carbon (3550 C) and several exotic ceramic materials, including tantalum hafnium (4215 C), which has the highest melting point of any known material. But in terms of degradation, the whole story isn't told by the melting point; most materials begin to lose their properties well before reaching their melting point (i.e., the infamous WTC steel beams that were damaged by a jet fuel fire without actually melting), so it would probably be most dependent on the application to say what material would be the most heat resistant.  As for your second question, we are constantly researching newer and better materials, so materials with lower thermal conductivities and higher melting points will certainly exist in the future."

A planet's orbit is determined by its trajectory when caught in the gravitational field of another. A planet is considered in a bound orbit when its total energy (potential + kinetic) is negative. If the total energy is 0 or greater the planet is not bound and will continue on a new trajectory past the other object. All orbits have a property called eccentricity (e) which basically describes how divergent they are. At 0<=e<1 we have an elliptical orbit, with e=0 being a special case of a circular orbit. At e=1 we have a parabolic orbit which is unbound and at the escape velocity from the other object meaning it will travel on to infinity if undisturbed. At e>1 we have hyperbolic orbits. There is nothing unstable about an elliptical orbit which would cause its eccentricity to decrease. In fact an elliptical orbit has constant total energy and angular momentum, a result of Kepler's second law. Fascinatingly, all types of orbit can be described by conic sections, as slices from a cone.  If you're still interested you should go through this orbital mechanics page."
askscience,3dl8rq,mtyler88,2,Fri Jul 17 09:43:30 2015 UTC,"In a two-body problem like gravity, in bound orbits (circles and ellipses), the semimajor axis a and the semiminor axis b of the orbit are given by   a = -GMm/(2E)  b = L2/sqrt(-2uE)   where G = gravitational constant, M = mass of one body, m = mass of the other body, E = energy, L = angular momentum, and u = 1/(1/m+1/M) = reduced mass.  What this all means is that there are really two parameters that determine the motion of the two bodies: the energy E and the angular momentum L. Both are conserved quantities. So the only way to change from an elliptical orbit to a circular orbit is to change one or both of these parameters.  Your question about whether the orbits would sort of slowly balance themselves out is pretty much the same story. Suppose magically that you just suddenly appeared at some height above the Earth with some speed, not necessarily tangent to the Earth's surface directly below you. Other than probably dying, what would happen to you? Let's assume that only the Earth's gravity acts on you. So no atmospheric drag, no Moon gravity, no Sun gravity, nothing else. So your energy E and angular momentum L remain conserved. You will then just be taken into orbit about the Earth. (The point at which you appear is a point on your orbit.) The formulas I gave above for the semiaxes determine the shape of your orbit. I don't want to give the impression that it takes time for you to get into orbit. The point where you magically appear is already on the orbit, so you just continue on some elliptical path around the Earth, returning to your starting point once per orbit.  This technique is used in space travel methods like the Hohmann transfer, which is a basic method of transferring from one orbit to another. The principle is very simple. At some point on your current orbit, give yourself a boost of speed using rockets or whatever. This increases both L and E, creating an imbalance between the gravitational and centrifugal forces. So you move onto an elliptical transfer orbit which reaches farther out than your original orbit. (You can then boost again a bit later to move yourself onto an even farther circular orbit.) When you boost yourself, you don't quite have the right values of L and E to maintain your original orbit, hence why you move outward."

This is why its difficult to build roads in parts of Russia and Alaska.   The trains have an advantage, because the gravel is very stable, and much less is required to produce a fairly thin track. While roads are very wide and would require several times the gravel to be stable and to avoid cracking unacceptably.   But to answer your question directly, train tracks actually a built with a machine that vibrates the ground and compacts the gravel. This helps guarantee that the tracks will not erode.   The rubble is also inspected and any weak areas are fixed fairly easily by an automated machine. This isnt really possible with roads, which require a substantially larger amount of effort to fix defects with the foundation. Since the road itself needs to be torn up, but train tracks can be fixed without even lifting the tracks."

In addition it provides protection from erosion by allowing reasonable water flow under the tracks while still maintaining contact with the rails and ties.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_ballast

In fact, we define unit2 and unit3 to mean surface areas and volumes equivalent to those of a unit by unit square and a unit by unit by unit cube respectively. You could just as easily defined unit2 to mean something that has equivalent area to a square with side length of unit1/2, and unit3 to mean equivalent volume to a cube that has a side length of unit1/3.

The region of galaxies receding at less than the speed of light is bounded by the Hubble Sphere which you can see here:     http://www.dark-cosmology.dk/~tamarad/astro/scienceimages/Spacetime_diagrams.pdf   The top of the graph equates redshift z to distance. Farther away things have larger redshift. Notice how the redshift at the boundary of the Hubble sphere isn't infinite. This means objects receding away from us faster than light are perfectly visible at least for now.    Now your next question is how is this possible? Here's a paper about the physical meaning of such velocities:     Davis, Lineweaver. (2001) ""Superluminal Recession Velocities"" http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0011070   The ultimate reconciliation is that we're dealing with general relativity and not special relativity. We are under no obligation to measure non-local speeds as being less than the speed of light (you can blame what is called coordinate velocity for this). As a simple example, consider sitting in a gravity well (like Earth) observing light beams bouncing back and forth in space far away. Since time is dilated for you, sitting in the well, you'll see the light exceed the speed of light. However, if you leave the gravity well and go near the bouncing beams, c constantcy is restored.    Even most dramatic, from the chart (easiest in the third one) there are objects who were at one time in our past light cone which have been always traveling superluminally and always will which is approximately any object with a redshift 3 or greater."

You cannot unambiguously define the speed between two distant objects, more precisely objects separated by significantly curved spacetime. The expansion means that spacetime is curved.  You can define a coordinate velocity by setting up cosmological coordinates and then considering the proper distance between the two galaxies. The derivative of that distance with respect to the time coordinate of your coordinate system is the coordinate velocity. This velocity is absolutely arbitray, depending on the choice of coordinates, and is not constrained to being less than c."

Turning the Hubble Space Telescope outwards and hoping to find an Oort cloud object, for example, would be like trying to see individual electrons in front of you with the naked eye.  Still, the main reason why the Oort cloud is often considered fact is that it's one of the most logical explanations for the existence of long-period comets like Hale-Bopp, since their orbits show that they must have originated from a region beyond the Kuiper belt.  On top of that, many computer models of the Solar System's formation predict that the gas and ice giants would have scattered an enormous amount of icy planetesimals outwards in the system's early, debris-rich days.  This would have ejected most of them from the system, but some would have just remained attached to the Sun and fallen into orbits thousands of times more distant than those of the modern Kuiper belt, scattered disc, and detached/Sednoid objects (assuming that ""detached objects"" like Sedna aren't actually the closest members of the inner Oort cloud).  Most of those objects would have been ejected from the Solar System, but a small fraction (still comprising a numerous population) would have remained gravitationally bound to the Sun in the form of the Oort cloud.

For transparency, you need a smooth surface (here is an unpolished diamond), minimal structural defects (cracks, voids, ...), and you need it to not absorb light. Absorption of light mainly occurs when the energy of a photon is enough to excite an electron in the material to a higher energy state. If the photon energy is too low, it won't be able to promote the electrons and so not absorption takes place. In all those materials, the energy gaps are very large, so visible photons aren't enough to promote the electrons and don't get absorbed. If there's no cracks, voids, or other defects, they don't get scattered either and just pass straight through, making a transparent material."
askscience,3dlqfq,KingKha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:09:17 2015 UTC,So what changes when they take a typically transparent solid and make it opaque? DO they change the molecular composition of the solid so that it is no longer the same as the transparent version?
askscience,3dlqfq,jonde99,2,Fri Jul 17 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"It depends.  All the issues KingKha mentioned can be interfered with to create an opaque material:   You can make the surface less smooth.  You can see this in some decorative glassware. You can introduce minute defects, like microscopic bubbles You can add a material that is less transparent, either on the surface or inside. In some materials (like skin) the material is transparent if the molecules making up the material are mostly oriented in the same direction but opaque if they are oriented in multiple directions.  So the opacity of such materials can be manipulated by altering how consistent the molecules are organized."

Essentially, there are different molecules secreted by each of four poles of the brain (front-center, back-center, front-outside, back-outside), and a cell can read its position based on the concentration of the secreted molecules in its environment; see this graphic for more details.  Based on the concentration of secreted molecules in its environment, the cell goes on to express different amounts of identity-determining genes, and area specialization continues for about two weeks in mice (and longer in humans)."

He just explained the physical effects on brain cells structure during the presence of these chemicals. These molecules activate transcription factors which literally give direction to neurons as they grow, and thats how the matter accumulates. These transcription factors though, are based off of genes and the modification of those genes by epigenetic factors. These genes are very specific, and encode the olfactory area within a specific neurohormone that can only be used once the chemicals have reached the proper destination. At a cellular level once the brain is developed and even during development, its simple difference in histology that differentiates where the next group of direction-giving chemicals will travel.  These chemicals can detect difference in histology, and give direction for growth and thats how these regions grow to be different."

askscience,3dkwzy,ViperSRT3g,3,Fri Jul 17 11:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, the weight would still push the magnet down against the ground. This is because for every reaction, there must be an equal and opposite reaction. So for any force put on the magnet, an equal force will be pushed in the opposite direction. So the ground has to take that force.   Now, the reason that things like airplanes and helicopters dont push against the ground and crush everything they fly over is because they cancel out the weight by transferring it to MOVEMENT of the air. So the weight becomes air flow and friction of the air itself. The force the aircraft puts out doesnt magically disappear, its just using different forces that have different effects.   So the magnets have to get rid of the force somehow, and the only way is to keep it in place. If the ground wasnt there, the magnet would shoot off in the opposite direction with just as much force as the elephant on the other magnet."

askscience,3dkq64,mark-henry,4,Fri Jul 17 01:37:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense to talk about the temperature of ""space"" itself. We can talk about the temperature of objects in space, but the problem is that the temperature will depend on the situation, the material, and the surrounding environment.  Your intuition is pretty close: if you could keep an object perfectly shaded from sunlight, it would keep getting colder and colder as it radiated heat into space. It wouldn't quite approach absolute zero, though. It would eventually reach equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has a temperature of about 2.7K. And in reality, we can't shield things perfectly -- whatever reflective shielding you use will still absorb and re-radiate some thermal energy.  For a single object that isn't shielded by something else, the average temperature will depend on the total amount of incoming radiation. At the Earth's distance from the sun, that means you'll have roughly the same average temperature as the Earth. The equilibrium temperature for a blackbody in Earth's orbit is about 280K. (The Earth's actual temperature is warmer because of the good old greenhouse effect.) But that's just an average; since heat isn't conducted through the object infinitely fast, its actual temperature will be hotter or colder at different points.  If I had to hazard a guess, Chris Hadfield's comment in that video was probably referring to the typical temperature of shaded parts of something like the ISS. There are lots of things that would affect that, such as thermal radiation from the Earth itself, and conduction through the body of the station."
askscience,3dlqjc,backfacecull,3,Fri Jul 17 08:06:09 2015 UTC,"In answer to your title, yes, there are scientists who have devoted their careers to this.  The most widely accepted theory of how peacocks got their tails is that the genes for a male having a beautiful tail, and the genes for a female liking the beautiful tail are linked (on the same chromosome) so they are inherited together. Therefore a peahen will have the gene which predisposes her to like the males fancy tail, but also a gene that if she were male, would give her a fancy tail. Conversely the cock will have the gene which, were he female, would predispose him to like the fancy tail. The theory goes that this led to a runaway evolution of fancy tails.  Your idea is that a mutation in the female gene, causing them to prefer a plain tail, might be advantageous.  However, if the theory outlined above is correct then this would work, as the female would have produce offspring which would prefer plain tails (in the case of the females) but possess fancy tails (in the case of males). Clearly this gene would not survive as the females would struggle to find a mate. Otherwise, simultaneous mutations would have to occur in the male and female genes, which is unlikely.  Examples of runaway evolution such as this are rare; few species possess features which are such a liability except in the ability to attract mates.  I would recommend reading Richard Dawkins' ""The Blind Watchmaker"", he discusses the specific example of peacocks in detail."
askscience,3dlqjc,spontoon,3,Fri Jul 17 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"It seems like there's no clear theory as to why sexual selection exists      There's a long history and a very robust body of theory here. It's a very important topic in the evo literature actually.       However, females in this landscape would greatly benefit from a mutation that prefers less elaborate traits. Should a peahen prefer a less elaborate tail, she will have more males to choose from      But the males will be of lower quality.     That's for a couple of reasons. First is that those extreme secondary sex characters are usually honest indicators of health. Any parasitism or disease stops the production of the most attractive traits. So choosing the male with the best tail is also choosing the healthiest male.     Second is that choosing a male with a less attractive tail would make her male offspring less sexy. 'Sexy sons' are part of the reason to choose sexy males. Her offspring will be more attractive to the other females, so her inclusive fitness is increased by choosing the best tail.       So if she preferred less elaborate tails she would be choosing unhealthy males that will also create less fit male offspring.      Why is there not a balancing force pushing peafowl back to a camouflaged state?       There is actually. Natural selection balances sexual selection for the  showy traits in males and sex specific expression allows NS to prevail in females."

askscience,3dlqjc,NPeqP,2,Fri Jul 17 13:36:42 2015 UTC,I think your issue is claiming the females male offspring will be less burdened. If she mates with a male without an elaborate tail then her male children won't have elaborate tails themselves. This means that they won't be as able to find females because a vast majority of females require males to have a large tail. This would seem to indicate that any female that doesn't conform to the standard preferences would be disadvantaged as about half of their offspring would have difficulty finding mates and any male without a large tail would be even more quickly eliminated by the females selection. This would mean that a large rapid shift would be required to make going against the common preferences viable. Also large random events may also be responsible for the development of sexual selection systems as a large random change in preference would be required.
askscience,3dkz3v,lepriccon22,5,Fri Jul 17 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you were considering the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic and gravitational field, your potential would be the sum of the two corresponding potentials. The two potentials are kept completely separate. But the energy an electron gets from moving through typical gravitational fields is just negligible compared to the energy it gets from moving through electric potential. So in many classes of problems with both, you just ignore gravity. The motion of the charged particle is going to be dominated by the electromagnetic field. (This is not to say that gravity is never considered, just that, in particular in problems with current in wires, it's just an absolutely negligible effect.)  To give you an idea of why it is typically safe to ignore gravity, consider two parallel plates, with a vertical distance of h and a voltage drop of V between them. Also assume there is some uniform gravitational field between the plates. The electrical energy an electron gains by moving through this voltage drop is qV, and the gravitational energy it gains is mgh. Suppose these energies were equal. Then we would have   g = qV/mh   Put V = 1V and h = 1mm, which seems like a very typical configuration. Then we find that the gravitational field has strength g = 1.8 x 1014 m/s2. Even if we just required that the gravitational energy is within 3 orders of magnitude, we would still need a gravitational field of order 1011. For reference, the surface gravity of the Sun is about 274 m/s2, a full 11 orders of magnitude short of what is required."

There's three main things that can be varied in a signal which we use to encode data: frequency, phase, and amplitude. Different combinations of these are more useful than others for radio due to better tolerance to noise and collisions. Some combinations are better for use in 'closed' systems where the signal is sent over optical fiber or copper wires where it's possible to minimise the effects of external noise so the transmitted signal doesn't need to be very tolerant to it.  So, for various combinations of using frequency, amplitude and phase for encoding...   Amplitude only: AM, ASK Frequency only: FM, FSK Phase only: PM, PSK Amplitude and Phase: QAM, SSB Freq & Amp:  Do AM/ASK in multiple frequency bands... Freq & Phase: Do PM/PSK/CPSK in multiple frequency bands! Freq & Phase & Amp: Do QAM/SSB in multiple frequency bands!   I don't know off the top of my head any common encodings that use both Freq+Amp or Freq+Phase encoding to encode the same signal, though it should be possible.

askscience,3dh12z,Bradm77,14,Thu Jul 16 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"The number itself isn't particularly important. But the family of functions of the form f(x)=cekx for real (or complex) values of c and k has some unique properties that make it crucial to many many domains.   One basic reason why is that often we have problems that, in words, look like this: ""y is a value that changes at a rate proportional to its level at time t. Find the relationship between y and t.""   As a concrete example, an applied problem might be examining the growth rate of populations. If you look at how populations grow, you'll find that the rate of change of a population at a time t depends on the population itself at that time. A little thought shows why. If you have only two people in the population, they can have at most 1 kid every 9 months, so your population is growing by at most about 1.3 people per year. But if you have a million people, they can all have kids every 9 months, so your population can grow by at most about 1.3 million people per year. So the rate at which the population changes depends crucially on the level of the population itself.   It turns out that whenever you have a relationship like this, where the rate of change of a variable y depends (proportionally) on the level of the variable y at time t, then the relationship between y and t always takes the form y=cekt for appropriate values of c and k. Some freshman level calculus will show you why y=cekt would satisfy that relationship, and if you take a slightly more advanced class on differential equations, you'll learn why the solutions always look like that.  This Wikipedia article and this one gives rather incomplete lists of things that are modelled by this sort of paradigm, but even though they are incomplete you can still see that the set of ways that this pops up in nature is huge. And it turns out that if you let c and k be complex numbers rather than real numbers, you can model an even bigger set of real world phenomena."

All first-order linear differential equations have solution formulas with an exponential. The ubiquity of the number e ultimately stems from the fact that the only function whose derivative is proportional to itself is an exponential. The number e is singled out since then the derivative of ex is just ex. But the base doesn't really matter. All exponentials can be written with base e, to wit, ax = ex log a .  Also, the exponential function is periodic with period 2πi, and so it also encompasses all phenomena that can be described by periodic functions.

This makes zero a special number for addition.  Let A be any number and consider the equation Ax=A. Is there a number that does nothing under multiplication? Yes, of course, x=1. This makes one a special number for multiplication.  If I have a circle of any diameter D, is there a solution to C=xD, where C is the circumference and x doesn't depend on D? Yes, of course, x=pi. This makes pi a special number for geometry.    If I now have derivatives d/dx, is there a function that satisfies df/dx=f(x)?   To answer this, we need to know a bit about differentiating exponent. Let f(x)=Ax, where A is a positive real number. To differentiate this I need to look at the difference quotient: (Ax+h-Ax)/h. I can use properties of exponents to pull out the common factor Ax to get the value AxC(h) where C(h)=(Ah-1)/h. To find the derivative, we need to take the limit of this as h->0. It's not hard to see that the limit of C(h) as h->0 exists, so let's call it c(A). This means that the derivative of Ax is c(A)AX. So if there were an A so that c(A)=1, then I would get d/dx(Ax)=Ax, making this A a particularly special number for calculus. It turns out that such a value exists and we call it e. The definition of e is the number so that A(e)=1. We then get d/dx(ex)=ex."
askscience,3dh12z,functor7,5,Fri Jul 17 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"There's been a lot said about ex being its own derivative and how that represents the growth of things in proportion to their current value. I may touch on that, but I think, like most things in math, one could benefit from a little history on the origins of e.  I was struggling for a while to write up a response to this last night. I really wanted to open up the hood and show some of the inner workings of mathematics in an intuitive way, but it was late and I was going down the rabbit hole a bit, so I ended up consulting Wikipedia which actually has a great explanation I'll paraphrase now:  Money and accounting have often prompted a lot of interesting questions in mathematics, and the birth of e is no exception. One of the Bernoulli brothers was thinking about compound interest: Say I have an amount of cash A that's paid back with 100% interest at the end of the year. Obviously, I'm paid A in full at year's end, and I have A+A=2A. What happens when my interest is paid back at increasingly finer intervals?  So say I'm paid 50% interest at half a year. That would mean at 6 months, I'm given A/2: A+A/2=3A/2. Now at the end of the year, I'm paid half of my current sum: 3A/2 + 3A/4 = 9A/4. Now generalize this to paying a third of my current sum at thirds of year, a fourth of it at fourths of a year, an nth of my existing balance at nth of the year; what happens to the total at the end  when I let n get arbitrarily large, i.e. paying me increasingly smaller fractions of my current total at increasingly smaller intervals of the year?  Mathematically, we can represent this general equation in the following way:   At the first nth of the year, I'm paid and nth of my total  A+A/n=A(1+1/n)  At the second nth of the year, I'm paid an nth of my existing sum, so my running total is  A(1+1/n) + (A(1+1/n))/n = A( 1+1/n+1/n+1/n2 ) = A( 1+2/n+1/n2 ) = A(1+1/n)2  Perhaps you see where this is going, but in general, my running total at the kth interval of the year is  Total=A(1+1/n)k  And my total at the end of the year will be A(1+1/n)n. Now we ask the question, what happens when n gets arbitrarily large? What happens as n marches on forever, when it ""reaches"" infinity? The limit of (1+1/n)n is the definition of e.  So now we've defined e. It represents continuous growth at ""100% interest"" over one standard period. In our example, the period was a year, but it could be anything. Now we can ask the question of what happens when we grow continuously after two years? Well, we start year two with Ae, so year two will end with Ae x e = Ae2 ! What about 0.352 years? Ae0.352. Now we have a function that grows at a continuous exponential rate over time.  Once we get to calculus where we study the intricacies of instantaneous rates of change, continuous exponential functions would be important ones to study due to their real world applications. In a sense, every continuous exponential function is just erx in disguise. If b is a real number, then Ln(b) is the number such that eLn(b) = b. So,  bx = ( eLn(b) )x = exLn(b).  Long story short, e is inescapable when we talk about continuous exponential growth. If we are to study this behavior in calculus, we will need to understand ex."

The primary object of study are holomorphic functions, which preserve angles.  In applications, the identity makes it natural to describe a ""wave"" using the exponential function.

One is the immune system of animals: antibodies can recognise a specific protein (works also on all sorts of other molecules) and bind to it to ""mark it for destruction"" by macrophages. This method is commonly used to produce venom antidotes by injecting a little venom in an animal and then filtering out the antibodies from its blood.  Another way of degrading proteins that is extremely common in all living organisms is proteases (or proteolitic enzymes): these are proteines that can recognise a specific sequence of aminocids in another protein and cut it. Apart from being used for all sorts of purposes by living organisms (from food digestion to metabolism regulation) they also have medical applications, for example as antibiotics.

If we are looking for an unwickable liquid, we would want high weight, and strong cohesive forces.  Off the top of my head, mercury fits this.  Mercury will spread out on certain metal surfaces, like aluminum, but it is actually dissolving the metal in the process, which would make for a poor wick!  It doesn't spread on normally found materials like wood, or plastic or glass.  Another possibility would be fluorocarbons, since they tend to repel both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces."

We do know that geomagnetic reversals are something that happens in models of the geodynamo, so it's not as though we have no explanation for the occurrence. One of the first models to show this was this paper, but there have been numerous models that have demonstrated similar behavior, e.g. this paper, this paper, this one, this one, this one (not behind a paywall), this one, or this other one, and many many more. The key aspect is that these models are all able to produce reversals despite very different parameters, including different rates of rotation within the dynamo and different thermal or chemical gradients as partial driving forces. So, we know generally how it happens, but narrowing it down to how exactly it happens (and what is exactly driving it) is challenging, i.e. we have a set of reasonable solutions, but not a unique solution.  An important aspect of this in terms of validating various models, is that it's only recently that we have begun to develop global and high temporal resolution records of geomagnetic field orientation and intensity across reversals within the geologic record. The hope is that as we continue to build and improve these records across reversals, that we can begin to weed out the geodynamo models that produce reversals but that don't match what we know about field direction and intensity across reversals."
askscience,3ddmyk,CrustalTrudger,201,Wed Jul 15 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"Blatantly hitchhiking on /u/CrustalTrudger's nice geophysical-based answer here -- here's an ELI5 of how dynamos in general work.  The idea is that there is some sort of non-uniform flow in the molten core of Earth, and it acts as a dynamo.  Dynamos work because of a peculiar cancellation in the laws of electrodynamics: any conductive system with moving parts will tend to stretch magnetic field lines. (that is to say, moving a conductor through the magnetic field induces a current in the conductor; the magnetic field associated with that induced current happens to be just right to carry the original field lines along with the conductor!   Whew.).    That is to say, magnetic field lines act like they're loosely attached to any conductor, including a fluid.  So if you stir, say, a pot of seawater fast enough, magnetic field lines passing through the pot will get tangled up.  That's another way of saying that stirring a pot of seawater fast enough will generate electricity.  The simplest dynamo model I know of that can explain the gross behavior of the Earth and Sun is the dual self-excited homopolar generator.  The idea is to start with a homopolar generator - just a disk of metal mounted on a spindle, with a horseshoe magnet wrapped around the outside of the disk, and pickoff brushes at the spindle and the rim of the disk.  If you spin the disk, it will induce current between the spindle and the rim of the disk, making a D.C. generator.  It turns out that you can replace that with a self-excited homopolar generator -- just replace the horseshoe magnet with an electromagnet driven by the current coming from the generator itself.  If you turn the crank fast enough on a self-excited homopolar generator, you get a current(!) Cool! Any quantum-fluctuation magnetic field passing through the disk will induce a current, which will induce an exciting magnetic field, which will induce more current, etc. until the medium saturates at a strong field and current (or until the force required to turn the crank makes you slow down a bit).  But it could ""strike"" in either direction -- forward or reverse current (or, equivalently, field).  OK, now comes the tricky part.  You build two self-excited homopolar generators, but cross-wire them:  the (A) generator's brushes connect to the exciter electromagnet on the (B) generator, and vice versa.  If you turn both cranks, you get an unstable, dual-quasistable-state system with chaotic behavior.  There are two time-independent solutions to the system -- one with positive current flow and one with negative current flow.  Small perturbations around either solution oscillate and grow until the current crosses through zero and settles (for a while) around the opposite time-independent solution.  The switches happen quasi-periodically -- there's a characteristic time scale for it to happen, but they're not exactly predictable.  That is pretty much what dynamos like the Earth's or the Sun's do:  they shunt magnetic flux between two systems (a poloidal system that acts like an axially aligned bar magnet, and a toroidal one that acts like the field around a wire passing north-to-south), that are contained in the same body of conductive fluid; and the field reverses chaotically and quasi-periodically.  Both the Sun and Earth are far more complicated, as /u/CrustalTrudger pointed out.  But that gedankenexploration should help you build some intuition about how field reversals can happen."

What happens when the magnetic field weakens is that its constituent parts become more evident. The field is a summation of a dipole, a quadrupole, and other more minor components. As the main dipole weakens, we can start to see the quadrupole (this is the situation we have today). Look at a magnetic field map of the earth and you can see the 4 poles that are distinct from the main 2 poles, but not as obvious. I seem to remember reading a paper that stated that the quadrupole component might be responsible for the polarity reversal of the dipole component.

In Earth's case, many of these reasons would occur independently of the core's physical rotation.   For instance, instabilities could occur in the electromagnetic fields of the system itself, causing the electrical current to suddenly flow the opposite direction. Where there once was a positive current flow, replace with a negative, and vice versa. Interestingly, this means that where there once was magnetic north pole, you will find a magnetic south pole. Mind you: no physical change in the core's magma flow need occur, but the poles would have swapped!  Basically, your question seems to assume that there is a physical change in the rotation of the core that leads to the pole swap. In that case, there would be no assurance that the physical system would result in the same axis of rotation. Instead, the actual cause is electrical."

askscience,3ddmyk,aktap336,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:12:58 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge we don't know the exact mechanism internally of what happens during a reversal, although we've got some pretty plausible models. The models show that reversals can happen independently of external factors simply due to natural instabilities over time. There’s a paper in Nature by Glatzmaier and Roberts from 1995 that talks about this (One of Glatzmaier’s ex-students taught my geomag class in grad school). A solar process isn’t really needed to explain the event. It’s also hard to justify a solar effect because the Sun’s field is about 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the Earth’s at the location of Earth's orbit.  That said, it still would be interesting to look at remanent magnetism on other worlds, more to learn about the fields that used to exist in those places, rather than any influence of the sun’s magnetic field (which reverses on its own every 11 years).   Something to keep in mind is that rock locks in it's magnetic orientation after it cools past the Curie temperature (the temperature above which a rock loses its magnetic orientation) for that particular rock composition. Thus we see reversals on Earth at plate spreading ridges because crust is (over geologic time) constantly being created by volcanic action at those locations. The magnetic orientation at the time the lava cools into oceanic seafloor is the orientation of the little magnetic moments inside the rock. Because the Earth is a tectonically active planet, we have this record of reversals that are constantly being written like a needle on a seismograph.  Planets such as Mars and Venus, on the other hand, are not tectonically active and so one would need to measure the magnetism in lavas from volcanoes instead. Unfortunately volcanic eruptions on other planets are not as constant. Measurements on Mars could get us information from 2 billion years ago all the way to 2 million years ago, but lots of gaps in between.  Unfortunately Venus really isn’t a candidate, but it's not because of planet-wide resurfacing. It's thought that Venus resurfaces every 200-300 million years, and Earth has had hundreds of little reversals in that time period. If Venus had a magnetic field (it doesn’t), we might expect it to work similarly to Earth’s and thus expect lots of little reversals— especially true if reversals were due to a solar process.   Venus does have volcanoes that have erupted since its last resurfacing. However the intense heat at the surface of Venus keeps the crustal rock above the Curie temperature. So there wouldn’t be any magnetism to measure."

The geomagnetic reversal of earth's poles is still a relatively new thing, and most research starts within ~50 years.  On top of that, we still can only speculate on what the core of our planet is exactly composed of or even what sort of exact motion it may have (if any).  There may a be solid inner core rotating one direction inside a fluid outer core that has a general opposite flow, or they may go the same direction, or the inner core may be stable relative to the crust.

Waves caused by earthquakes travel both through the Earth's crust and through the core. By timing how long it takes the waves of a distant earthquake to travel through the core of the Earth, we can determine the speed of sound in the Earth's core. This provides information on the density of the Earth's core.  Also, at transitions in the core, a certain fraction of the Earthquake wave will be reflected. By measuring this we can determine some information about the different layers. This last bit is similar in principle to how ultrasound works on expectant mothers."

Essentially we see changing magnetic field lines and went to a theory of the poles flipping but they may be produced from a type of current  inside the mantle instead.

Anything orbiting is in a constant state of flux anyway, I couldn't imagine a scenario where a flip of the magnetic field would cause them to reposition. If the flip was in the form of a massive EM event then... well I could see them lose power, but then everyone on the surface would have lost power too so while I'm fairly sure that the switch would take a MUCH longer time than it would take to correct for any inaccuracies that there are already very few systems using instruments that could be adversely affected by things of this nature.

Instead, the interaction between a rotating (around the Earth's axis) and convecting (to and from the Earth's core) electrically conductive fluid (molten iron being the leading candidate) can maintain a magnetic field through the ""self""-interaction with that field.

To measure the System III rotation rate on giant planets, we measure how quickly the magnetic field rotates using a spacecraft. This technique works well for Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, because for each of those planets the magnetic field is significantly tipped from their rotational axis. (This is the same reason that when orienteering on Earth, true north is often a few degrees away from where your compass points.) The magnetic field wobbles as the planet rotates, and this wobble can be measured by the spacecraft.  For Saturn, however, this technique does not work well. The problem is that there's essentially no difference between Saturn's magnetic axis and its rotational axis - they are almost perfectly aligned, so there is no magnetic wobble. Why this is remains a mystery, but that's another topic.  So instead, we use the proxy of Saturn's ""kilometric radiation"". This is essentially a secondary space weather phenomenon like auroras or radiation belts. While it does modulate with the planet's rotation, it also seems to modulate with the space environment such as the current solar activity and solar wind speed. As a result, it's a very imprecise measurement - and at this point a lot of people think the difference between the Voyager and Cassini rotation rates that were found may have nothing to do with the planet's actual rotation rate, and likely much more to do with the space environment and its effect on the proxy measurement.  We have since come up with a new way of measuring Saturn's interior rotation rate, using the largest atmospheric waves. The propagation speed of the very longest wavemodes that can exist are strongly tied to the rotation rate of the deep interior, so we can observe those big waves, then back out how quickly the deep interior is rotating.  When this was done, it was found the old Voyager measurement was closer to the correct rotation speed, but even that was too slow.  TL;DR: Our method for measuring the rotation of Saturn's deep interior was old and busted. Our new method found there likely is no difference or change to the rotation rate."
askscience,3df8v5,Astromike23,15,Thu Jul 16 08:37:51 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on this, the reason so much credence was given to the magnetic field method is also because the magnetosphere of Jupiter gives you a really good approximation of the rotation rate of Jupiter- like, to the second precision.  This is because Jupiter has the strongest magnetosphere of any of the planets (10x stronger than Earth) and gives of what are essentially radio lasers, which are fueled by ions from its volcanic moon Io.  Seeing this radio laser is determined by the exact angle of Io, Jupiter in its rotation, and Earth, and when it's pointed at us it can be the brightest thing in the radio sky, so we can learn stuff about the inner liquid core's rotation really well from this method.  Saturn, on the other hand, does not have anywhere near as strong as a magnetosphere (we didn't know it existed until Voyager visited it), so this method does not work.  As for extrasolar planetary systems, it turns out we have observed this phenomena in brown dwarfs, but no confirmed observations from extrasolar planets using this phenomenon as yet.    Source: I find Jupiter's outbursts so cool I once wrote a Sky & Telescope article about this topic."

askscience,3df8v5,TomBombadildozer,11,Wed Jul 15 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"Tidal locking can be one-way or two-way.  One-way is where the satellite is tidally locked to the planet, but the planet is not tidally locked to its satellite.  This is the case with Saturn's moons or with Earth's moon.  Two-way is where both the planet and the satellite are tidally locked to each other.  This is the case with Pluto and Charon.  Earth's rotation speed is very gradually slowing down, and eventually (in billions of years) it will be tidally locked with the moon.  That can't ever be the case with Saturn because the whole planet is a giant ball of gas that can just spin around.  Plus it has more than one satellite, etch with different orbits, etc."

I don't think it necessarily says anything about tidal locking of either body.  In Pluto/Charon's case they are tidally locked to each other, but binary stars obviously aren't locked to each other for the same reason that Saturn can't be tidally locked: they're not solid.  Also binary systems can still have other objects orbiting them: Pluto/Charon has Nix and the other small moons, binary stars obviously can have planetary systems as well.  However they have to be small enough and far enough away that they (for the most part) just orbit the center of gravity of the two major masses and don't appreciably affect their orbit."

Averaged over the planet, it's the same - that's just conservation of angular momentum - but it's quite a bit different from location to location.  At the mid-latitudes in both hemispheres (USA, Europe & most of Asia in the Northern Hemisphere, Argentina and New Zealand in the Southern Hemisphere), there are strong jet streams that travel west-to-east. This is the reason why a flight from California to New York takes less time than the return flight - there's a tail wind. This is also the reason why most of the US and Europe's weather seems to come from the west. In general, whichever hemisphere is experiencing winter will have the stronger jet stream.  Closer to the equator, you have the trade winds, that travel east-to-west, though significantly less quickly than the mid-latitude jet streams. If you're ever in the tropics, you'll notice your weather tends to come from the east.  This gif shows the global water vapor over the last 5 days.

askscience,3df8v5,Astromike23,2,Thu Jul 16 09:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yes the cloud cover rotates at the same speed. We don't ""lag"" behind in any way because we spin at a constant speed. Only if something goes from north to south or the other way does the earth spin under it if it goes in a straight line. This is the coriolis effect in the reference frame of standing on the earth's surface. It plays a role in for example very far sniper shots (in the km range). The constant spin of the earth is only felt as a slight decrease in gravity because of the centrifugal force (which doesn't exist according to purists and does exist according to practical people who have real work to do https://xkcd.com/123/), this means that if the earth was never spinning, we'd be slightly heavier but not much at all."

This means than if the phase transition happened when the observable universe was already casually disconnected, then there is no reason for which this order parameter should be uniform.  This means we'd expect to see some topological defects, in the specific case cosmic strings/monopoles, but we don't yet. These would be massive and violent structures.  It's analogous to a magnet cooling down to below Curie temperature. If the cooling is fast enough and the magnet is large enough, you generally get different domains with different magnetizations bounded by topological defects.  Of course I did not asnwer the question, because I have no idea what the answer is. While we can sweep GUT monopoles under the rug with inflation, the EW transition happens well after inflation, and there is no way I know of to get rid of EW cosmic strings/monopoles."

If one adopts a slight change in perspective with the GWS model which shouldn't invalidate the match with experiment (reading the higgs doublet as a [;\mathbb{C}P^1;] field) it's possible to build Cho-Maison monopoles.

The device then uses the information contained in those waves to display the relevant message to the user.  So, for instance, your car radio works by receiving radio waves from a local AM radio station. The wave that is actually received has a certain group velocity and phase velocity, which really result from just summing many waves together. (AM radio waves are ""amplitude modulated"" waves, which means a wave is sent out with an amplitude that itself varies periodically over time. It turns out that such a wave is really just the sum of several waves.) Your car radio is able to determine the frequency and amplitude of each of those component waves, which it then uses to create a sound wave, which you hear as a song, a news story, etc.  Of course, this example of a radio station might obscure the fact that light does not need a medium since the radio waves are traveling through the air.

An example of that is on wires like Ethernet, USB and even circuits in mobile phones or any other devices. Those require a conductive material though.

But because light can also change frequency, we can also encode more information into it by changing the color of the laser.  This is directly analogous to changing the amplitude of the signal being sent of a radio wave, (flashing it on and off) as well as the frequency of the signal being sent (changing the colors).  Clearly all of this light travels through space pretty well, even though it's almost devoid of matter to impede light.

This hypothetical medium was called the ""luminiferous aether"" (or ""the aether"" for short). Physicists reasoned that as the Earth moves around the Sun, at one point in the year we would be moving in the same direction as the aether and six months later, we would be moving in the opposite direction to it. Just like two cars travelling parallel to one another but in either the same direction or opposite directions, we would expect our speed relative to the aether (and hence the measured speed of light) to vary depending on whether we were travelling along with it (giving a slower recorded light speed) or head on towards it (giving a faster recorded light speed).  Some physicists did an experiment to test this out, and they found no difference at all. This, along with the discovery of relativity, disproved the existence of the aether. Light travels through empty space without the need for a medium.  So what does fill that empty space that allows light to travel through it? An electromagnetic field.

For example, say I'm trying to figure out where in my image field a point source of light is. If I collect 3 photons from that point source and fit a point-spread function to them (lets say its Gaussian, for simplicity), then I will get an approximate position for the true position of the point source in my field. However, my approximate position will not be very accurate, because it was determined from only 3 points. On the other hand, if I collect 10,000 photons from the point source and fit a Gaussian to these points, I will be extremely sure of where in the field the source is, to an accuracy much better than the width of my point-spread function.    edit: now that I think about it, while what I said is true, that's not the same as increasing the resolution of the image. Since one of the steps is fitting, that requires certain assumptions about the source.

You don't get a point where that light hit the camera, but an area, and those potential areas that light can hit don't fill the entire area of the receiving chip (there's small spaces between each pixel).  It's even worse if you are taking color images, because then you have pixels covered with filters so they only(ish) respond to certain wavelengths of light, which are then averaged out to guess the color over that area.   This all leads to a great big mess of averaging out averages which puts a lot of limitations on how much more information you can get from combining multiple images."

For orbital sats, we've pretty much reached the limits of what's feasibly possible.   Only so much light from the sun reaches the earth and is reflected to a point in space over a given period of time.   In satellite imagery, you have 4 resolutions. Spatial (distance covered in 1 pixel), Spectral (specificity of light captured and number of bands), Radiometric (sensitivity to change in light), and temporal (how often images of same location can be captured). Increase any of these and it reduces the others.   For instance, if you go from 1 meter/pixel panchromatic (black and white) image sampling all light from Blue to Red spectra to RGB color without changing the temporal or Radiometric resolution, your spatial resolution will be about 3 meters, as each color band is only sampling certain colors and discarding the rest.   For a 100 megapixel image to register as white for an 8-bit/band color image with physically perfect optics in a 1 second exposure you need a minimum of 76,500,000,000 photons to strike the sensor in that second with a perfect distribution both spatially and spectrally (255 photons for each band of red, blue, and green per pixel).  So the stories you hear about military satellites being able to read watches aren't true.   That's why we have spy planes and drones in addition to satellites. We need to get closer to get details."

If the limitation of how many photons are landing on the receptor, due to the tiny sliver arc length from the 'watch' to the camera, then surely a larger collecting area could compensate.   To put it another way, say I could create a wormhole that allowed spacial but not time travel. Say I could use that wormhole to travel 65 million light years away? Now given I had the ability to warp space in such a way meant I also had the ability to bend space in similar manner that big heavy objects do. In effect I could replicate a gravitational lens.

Naturally occurring magnetic fields of that magnitude or greater (as far as I am aware) are only found around a few types of stars. If the earth was ever close enough to one of those for the magnetic field to be an issue, we would have much bigger problems to worry about than sleepwalking.  The short answer, I guess, is ""No."""
askscience,3dkrwc,zixaq,2,Sat Jul 18 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"Man oh man do I love K.S.R.  So, here's the deal.  No, it'd never happen.  Electric current can stimulate the brain, very strong magnetic fields can stimulate the brain, but electromagnetic radiation (radio waves, visible light, X-rays) don't really stimulate neural activity, although the higher energy forms of EM radiation can kill cells (or cause cancer).  From what I'm reading, the most plausible version of this story would involve very strong magnetic fields, rather than electromagnetism per se.  But the more important thing is that any kind of (magnetic or otherwise) is going to stimulate (if it sitmulates at all) the entire brain, not just sleep/dreaming/etc. areas.  For what this story describes to happen, there are certain specific brain areas that would need to be stimulated.  The brain's REM-ON region (I am actually giving a lecture on this today!) is called the sub-laterodorsal nucleus of the pons, or SLD.  In order to produce what the story decribes (since it specifically refers to REM), the SLD would need to be stimulated in particular (especially since if other parts of the sleep system were being equally stimulated, the overall effect would almost certainly NOT be a shift towards REM, since there are many areas that oppose / inhibit the SLD, and also the vlPOA, the main sleep-promoting region of the brain).  A good example of this that's easier to understand is this:  If you administer a drug that stimulates all/most of the cells in the brain (or inhibits them), you don't see people falling suddenly into REM sleep.  The brain is much too reilient to be completely thrown off like that by global stimulation / inhibition.  In other words, the effects described would require the stimulation of a very specific combination of brain areas, which would not be possible with any field that is affecting the brain as a whole.  There's no way a ""cosmic field"" could tailor itself to hit every single human's SLD / vlPOA / etc. without hitting the brain areas that counteract those circuits.  Lastly, there IS such a thing as a condition in which someone goes into REM sleep but acts on their dreams, and it is NOT the same thing as sleepwalking.  It's called REM sleep behavior disorder, and it doesn't manifest in the way that sleepwalking does (actually interacting with environment, albeit in a sometimes odd way), but rather by interacting with the imagined environment, which tends to mean odd flailing motions, running motions, which can result in falling out of bed or striking one's partner."

Technically, jumping either up or down would both lower your perigee and raise your apogee slightly.  If my math is right, then a vertical delta-v of 3m/s (which is equivalent to being able to jump 0.5m straight up on the earth's surface) translates to an 80 meter increase in your orbit's semi-major axis, a 0.25 second increase in your orbital period, and therefore ""bunny hops"" of about 750 meters per orbit."
askscience,3dgrnr,teraflop,12,Thu Jul 16 05:35:15 2015 UTC,"A very similar question was asked in the Astronomy section, and my post gives some more details about what happens if you exit the elevator at a given height, not necessarily equal to the geosynchronous height. For convenience, this is the full text of the post:  You would simply orbit in a geosynchronous orbit about Earth.  A more interesting question though is what would happen if you stepped off at some other height. Suppose this mysterious space elevator were some structure fixed to Earth, so that the entire elevator is rotating with the Earth. A ""real"" space elevator is not actually a fixed structure, but a cable attached to Earth, with a counterweight at the other end. So the cable leans and sways with the wind, and more important, is affected by Coriolis forces. In the analysis that follows, I am assuming that Earth is perfectly spherical and that the elevator is a fixed, rigid structure that does not sway or lean. It's just a hypothetical device that juts out of the Earth and lets you exit at any desired height.  Since the elevator is rigid, the entire structure has a uniform angular speed, fixed at [; \omega = 2\pi/T ;] where the period [; T ;] is 1 day. Now, by Kepler's third law, we know that the radius of a geosynchronous orbit is related to the angular speed by [; r_{geo}^3 = GM/\omega^2 ;].  Suppose you step off the elevator at a height [; h ;] (as measured from the center of Earth). You will end up in orbit, but let's assume for now that it is a bound orbit (i.e., a circle or ellipse). Your orbit has a semimajor axis given by  [; a = -\frac{GMm}{2E} ;]  and a semiminor axis given by  [; b = \frac{L}{\sqrt{-2mE}} ;]  where [; E ;] is your (conserved) energy [; L ;] is your (conserved) angular momentum. I am also assuming, obviously, that your mass is much smaller than that of Earth. At the moment you step off the elevator, your energy and angular momentum are given by  [; E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{GMm}{h} ;]  [; L = mh^2\omega ;]  Your speed is given by the formula  [; v^2 = \dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta}^2 ;]  where dots refer to time derivatives. We are assuming that you simply step off the elevator, and that you do not jump off. (We will return to that part later.) Stepping off means that your radial velocity is initially zero. So we have [; r = h ;] and [; \dot{r} = 0 ;] initially. Now let's measure your step-off height as a fraction of the geosynchronous orbit. So define the dimensionless parameter  [; \lambda = \frac{h}{r_{geo}} ;]  Now before we do anything, we can combine the equations with energy to get  [; -\frac{GMm}{2a} = \frac{1}{2}m(h\omega)^2-\frac{GMm}{h} ;]  Then eliminate [; \omega ;] in favor of [; L ;], which itself can be expressed in terms of the semiaxes. After a bit of algebra, the result is the following equation.  [; h^2-2ah+b^2 = 0 ;]  This is a quadratic equation with solutions  [; h = a\pm\sqrt{a^2-b^2} ;]  The eccentricity of an ellipse is a number between 0 and 1 that describes how much the ellipse deviates from being a circle, with eccentricity of 0 corresponding to a perfect circle. It is given by  [; \epsilon = \sqrt{1-(b/a)^2} ;]  So our solutions for [; h ;] can be written in the more illuminating form  [; h = a(1\pm\epsilon) ;]  What does this say? This equation says exactly that your height [; h ;] is the apogee (plus sign) or perigee (minus sign) of your orbit. The apogee is the point on your orbit farthest from Earth, and the perigee is the point closest to Earth. This is pretty interesting. If you simply step off at any height, you are automatically in an orbit at either apogee or perigee. How do you know if it is apogee or perigee? Simple. If you step off lower than geosychronous height, it is apogee. If you step off higher than geosynchronous height, it is perigee. In the general case of jumping off (up or down) and not simply stepping off, you initially give yourself some radial velocity. So although you are still on an orbit with the semiaxes in those formulas, your jumpoff height is just some general point on the orbit, not equal to apogee or perigee.  Now let's return to the general equations, where we are measuring height in units of geosynchronous height. We can combine all of these equations to get the following expressions for the semi-axes of your elliptical orbit:  [; a = h \left(\frac{1}{2-\lambda^3}\right) ;]  [; b = h \left(\frac{\lambda^3}{2-\lambda^3}\right)^{1/2} ;]  You can verify explicitly for yourself that [; a = b ;] (i.e., your orbit is circular) if and only if [; \lambda = 1 ;] (i.e., you step off right at the geosynchronous radius). You can also verify that [; a \geq b ;] for all values of [; \lambda ;], as a sanity check on our calculations. Indeed, the eccentricity of your orbit is  [; \epsilon = \sqrt{1-(b/a)^2} = |\lambda^3-1| ;]  Also note that the actual value of [; \omega ;] does not really matter; these formulas hold for any planet. We have removed all scaling by defining everything in terms of the natural scaling given by the geosynchronous height, so this makes sense. (Of course, the geosynchronous height differs for each planet.)  Now let's go back to the assumption of the bound orbit. You should notice that [; a ;] becomes infinite if [; \lambda = 2^{1/3}\approx 1.26 ;]. At this stepoff height, your total energy is actually [; E = 0 ;], which means that your motion is not bounded; it is parabolic. This critical value of [; \lambda ;]could also be derived by simply computing the height that corresponds to Earth's escape velocity. The critical height occurs at about 53,220 km from Earth's center.  If your stepoff height is even higher, then your energy is higher, and your orbit is still unbounded, but hyperbolic. What went wrong with the equations exactly? Well, they are derived under the assumption of a bound orbit. So beyond [; \lambda = 2^{1/3} ;], the equations are just not true anyway.  So, in summary, if you step off too high, you just end up floating away from Earth, never to return. (Well, the analysis of your motion just gets more complicated, since you would still be in a bound orbit about the Sun. But for the analysis here, we were assuming your motion was dominated by Earth's gravity.) (In reality, the atmosphere will also apply a drag force on you, thus lowering your tangential speed at a given radius. So you will drop to a lower orbit. Your orbit will continue to decay unless you accelerate yourself. Also, in reality, this space elevator doesn't really exist. But it's fun to think about anyway.)  There is also a practical lower limit to your stepoff height. There exists a stepoff height such that your orbit will just barely graze the surface of the Earth. How do we find this lower critical height? Remember that if you step off below geosynchronous height, then you are at apogee. So the condition for your orbit to just avoid not colliding with Earth is that perigee is at a height equal to Earth's radius.  [; r_{Earth} = r_{perigee} = a(1-\epsilon) = h\left(\frac{\lambda^3}{2-\lambda^3}\right) ;]  This equation is equivalent to  [; \lambda^4-k\left(2-\lambda^3\right) = 0 ;]  where [; k = r_{Earth}/r_{geo} \approx 0.1507 ;]. The approximate solution to this equation is [; \lambda \approx 0.706 ;], which corresponds to a height of about 29,820 km. If your stepoff height is lower, your orbit will eventually collide with Earth and you will come crashing down in a blaze of glory.  edit: Fixed up some typos and some language. I also forgot another interesting part: your period, the time it takes for you to complete an orbit. Again, assuming your mass is negligible compared to that of Earth (why would it not be though?), Kepler's third law gives us the answer. So  [; \tau^2 = \frac{4\pi^2a^3}{GM} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}\cdot\frac{h^3}{(2-\lambda^3)^3} ;]  If we express the period [; \tau ;] in terms of the geosynchronous period (which is, of course, 1 day), we get  [; \tau = \tau_{geo}\left(\frac{\lambda^3}{2-\lambda^3}\right)^{1/2} ;]  You can verify for yourself that [; \tau = \tau_{geo} ;] if and only if [; \lambda = 1 ;] (i.e., if you step off at geosynchronous height. Otherwise, your period is longer or shorter, depending, respectively, on whether your stepoff height is higher or lower than geosynchronous height."

Just look at the moon. That's a quarter million miles away and not heading into the middle of the solar system or out of the solar system.    You need a significant amount of extra velocity to change your position relative to the earth's orbit, or the earth's orbit is where you're staying.    Of course, once you've got out of the earth's immediate pull, you've done a lot of the work, and as you've done a lot of the work, you didn't also need to carry all the fuel to get to that point, which is why a space elevator is so helpful."
askscience,3dgrnr,3226,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:35:12 2015 UTC,"My post was maybe a little inaccurate, but your rebuttal doesn't make sense either. You need to go out way less than the moon's orbit to get thrown away with escape velocity by an elevator (53000km as someone pointed out below, way less than the moon's ~400000km).  The reason is that the space elevator is tethered to the Earth and thus ""locks"" your angular velocity to its rotation. At geosynchronous orbit height, that's exactly what you would need for a stable orbit. Anywhere above that a stable orbit would have less angular velocity... thus the elevator makes you start faster than a stable (circular) orbit, and you travel outward. (It just depends whether that extra kick is enough to escape Earth or whether you get caught in a parabolic orbit and eventually fall back.)"

If you're in, or near, geostationary orbit, you're still orbiting the earth and you're not going anywhere.    The important measure to move your position is delta V. You need a change in velocity provided by thrust to get from, say, the earth's orbit to Mars. There's a Delta V map  which shows what's required to get from one body to another. It would take 13Km/s delta V to reach geostationary orbit. It would take less than that to get to Mars, but you would still need thrust. It doesn't come for free. You could slingshot around the moon for some of it, but that's simply using the moon's angular momentum."

At any point above geosynchronous orbit height, that is more angular velocity than a stable circular orbit would need... the left-over velocity directly translates into extra ""free"" delta V for you. (Although as others have pointed out, you actually need to be above ~1.5 times geosynchronous orbit height in order for it to be enough to escape Earth's gravity.)"
askscience,3dgrnr,darkslide3000,2,Thu Jul 16 09:46:32 2015 UTC,"This is not necessarily right. This scenario only holds if the top of the Space Elevator is far enough beyond geosynchronous orbit for it to be traveling at escape velocity.  Essentially, the further the elevator top is from the Earth, the faster the tip is traveling. At exactly GEO altitude, stepping off the elevator would place you in a GEO orbit, going at the same speed as the elevator. If you go beyond GEO orbit and step off, you'll start to follow an elliptical orbit with an apogee greater than your step-off altitude. Going far enough beyond GEO would give the elevator enough speed to place you in a hyperbolic escape orbit.  The longer you make th elevator, the more tension the cable has to endure. That means the higher you build your elevator, the less structurally feasible it becomes."

Light is more likely to bounce if it hits the glass at a steep angle so this is especially bad during mornings and evenings.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the Ventral Tegmental Area and Substantia Nigra, which have a couple major projections. One of those projections is called the meso-limbic tract, which communicates pleasure signals to the Nucleus Accumbens. A variety of sensory signals might activate this sensation. Food - in particular, tasty bits - certainly do.  In terms of bad tastes, this adds a whole nother dimension, because it must first become associated with unsavory connotations. (I think food and sweets are more innately associated with pleasure, although I'm not sure). There is another pathway recruited for this, and I believe it involves the amygdala and gustatory cortex. Both of those most likely use your more traditional Glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters.   Overall, the brain uses a variety of signal carriers or neurotransmitters to translate electrical messages into chemical, back into electrical messages. However, it's more so the pathway and pattern of modulation that connotes specific responses. Dopamine often gets associated with strictly pleasurable emotional gunk. That's why people tattoo it above their ass cracks. In reality it's just another neurotransmitter that might as well be associated with functions of any of the other pathways it's associated with. e.g. Fine motor movements in the meso-cortical tract (I think)"

Additionally, even if a part of the amygdala is inhibited, that may still have an overall effect of activating a fear or displeasure response. Even dopamine is a bit more complex.

As has been mentioned previously, the effect of dopamine is entirely dependent on the receptor that it binds to.  With that being said, when looking at the reward pathway in the brain, one needs to look at firing rates of dopaminergic neurons.  There is a basal level of firing of these dopaminergic neurons that will occur in an animal experiencing nothing pleasurable or unpleasurable. In the case of a rewarding stimulation, you see increases in the firing rate of these neurons which in turn leads to an increase in dopamine being released. However, in the case of a noxious stimulation, you see the firing rate actually decreases and you see a lower amount of dopamine relative to the basal level. Thus, you have a ""set point"" of normal dopamine that can be increased or decreased following a stimulation like good or bad food, which in turn encodes the valence of the food.  Here is a paper that demonstrates how firing rates can be modified through training (though it does not compare pleasure vs noxious, the results suggest that firing rates are modulated in both upward and downward directions): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564381/"

This even extends to galaxies. Not all systems act perfectly like this due to external factors, etc, however, it is very common.  The reason for this lies with the conservation of angular momentum. Say you have a spherical cloud of dust particles around a planet. By first instinct, it seems like this could result in an infinite combination of inclined disks orbiting the planet. However, with this spherical dust cloud, as soon as some portion of the cloud becomes more massive (due to clumping, collisions, etc), the cloud will begin to orient itself about that more massive region's orbital plane over large time scales.  In this example, angular momentum causes spin or rotation of the whole mass, and the mutual gravity soon causes outliers to conform to that rotation.   The same would apply for a system with rings at different inclinations. Unless the rings never collided, and their mass and momentum exactly averaged out so that there was a perfectly even distribution of mass, it would revert to a single disk over time."

For these inertial forces though, we have to introduce an extra force to introduce deviation from linear motion. Gravity, on the other hand, needs to preserve free motion while allowing for linear deviations, so we need to make the theory incorporate the idea of the curvature of spacetime.  A common phrase in GR is 'Spacetime tells matter how to move, matter tells spacetime how to curve'."
askscience,3didbl,CodyBStrange,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:15 2015 UTC,"The Galilean (classical) and Lorentzian (SR) transformations follow from two simple principles: (1) the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames and (2) causality must be preserved. The distinction between Galilean and Lorentzian transformations is made according only to whether there is an upper speed limit in the universe. It is an experimental fact that there is, indeed, an upper speed limit. Furthermore, there actually exists something that travels at that speed (light), but the existence of such an object is not necessary.  So time dilation, length contraction, and all the familiar relativistic effects from SR ultimately derive from the fact that inertial frames must transform into each other in such a way to keep the speed of light constant.  Now in GR, the equivalence principle (EP) implies that gravity should be thought of as resulting from the curvature of spacetime. SR showed us that time and space are not separate but exist in something called spacetime, and we can show that the curvature of this (Minkowski) spacetime is ""flat"". GR generalizes the possibilities to any of infinitely many possible spacetimes. The spacetime metric (from which we can derive the curvature) is determined by the energy density (which includes matter) of the universe. (The energy density is encoded in something called the stress tensor.) But the equations are not as simple as: ""give me the stress tensor, and I give you the metric"". The stress tensor (and therefore the matter and energy) are coupled to the metric. That is, the metric changes if the stress changes, and vice versa. Spacetime itself is a dynamical variable, which affects the matter and energy in it, which itself affects the spacetime as it moves around in it."

In general relativity, gravity is an observed effect due to the curvature of spacetime, i.e. not just time but space also. So not only does time tick slower near massive objects, but distance also changes, relative to the frame of an observer further from the mass.  If we extend your statement to include the effects of mass on both time and space, then what you end up with is the traditional GR description of gravity: the observed force of gravity is an effect due to the behavior of objects moving through curved spacetime.  It's spacetime curvature that causes gravity, not the other way around, and mass that causes spacetime curvature.

However, the information is controlled by physical means. That is, information processing requires the movement of electrons. Even if a form of processing utilizing photons, quarks, or even strings were possible, these all utilize the physical nature of the world.  The core concept of information processing is the existence of a thing (electron, photon, ...) in one place over another. Imagine a grid of holes where you could place and move ping pong balls around. There are two ways to consider the limitations of this. The first is straightforward. The second is not as obvious and much more difficult to understand.  The first is to consider the smallest size that the ""hole"" that the ""ping pong ball"" can fit into. A Planck Volume is the smallest size that our laws allow us to consider. A Planck Volume can be considered to be a cube that is 1.6*10-35 meters on each edge. You can then imagine the existence or non-existence in each of these holes could show up as a 1 or a 0 respectively. However, it would probably not be this easy because of the second consideration.  The second consideration is the uncertainty principle. The smaller the ""ping pong ball"", the harder it is to tell where exactly it is relative to it's motion. That is, if we knew exactly where an electron was, we would have no idea of how fast is was moving or in what direction. The more we know about it's motion, the less accurate we are on the position. This is an obvious issue with processing since we need to know if the ping pong ball is or is not in a specific hole.  They are already seeing issues because of the uncertainty principle.

These bubbles are generally unstable (or metastable), meaning that within a certain amount of time they will spontaneously dissipate (burst), releasing the trapped gases back towards the outside. What is different about a soapy solution (compared to pure water) is not the fact that you form bubbles in the first place, but that you are significantly slowing down the rate at which the bubbles will break up, such that you can produce a long lived foam that will last on the order of minutes to hours.  The key factor needed to make long-lasting foams is the presence of surfactants. Surfactants are amphiphilic compounds (molecules with both a polar (water seeking) part and a non-polar part) as shown here. Such amphiphilic molecules constitute the key active ingredient in soaps and detergents since these molecules naturally form water soluble structures called micelles which can trap fats and other compounds (i.e. exactly what you want when cleaning). Now when it comes to bubbles, the role of the surfactants is a bit indirect: 1. first they reduce the water tension, and 2) their presence in turn stabilizes bubbles through the so-called Marangoni effect.   You can see a cool demonstration of the Marangoni effect here, but it's basic idea is that particles will spontaneously flow from regions with a lower surface tension to regions of higher surface tension. The way this effect manifests itself for foams is that if the foamy film is disturbed and becomes kinked as shown here, then because the surfactants move more slowly than the liquid in the interior of the film, the surface tension at the kink will be higher. This will then cause liquid to move from the area surrounding the kink (the region with lower surface tension) into the kink (the area with higher surface tension), thus restoring the shape of the film."

If you live with dogs you'll even share skin microbes with your dog (although it's not clear if these are permanent or just transient from hanging out with your dog).  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628085/  Without doubt changes in your skin flora will change your body odour and intimate contact over enough time will move one another's resident skin flora closer to one another.

One theory is that mosquitoes can detect the smell of an animal with malaria and the mosquito will preferentially bite the infected.  Thus malaria is likely to be spread by scent.  In general, your skin is covered with lots of microbes, some can be quite smelly.  If someone gets a bad candida fungal infection, the results can smell like ... umm ... feces."

askscience,3dkqhf,striker7770,2,Fri Jul 17 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think your first question might be re-stated as ""are the exact same neurons and connections between them (synapses) involved when I repeat an action a second time?"" The answer to that is no, generally speaking, for two reasons.  First, you're never going to do something exactly the same way twice. You can't, there are two many things that can change: light, temperature, the exact position of your body as you move, what you had for breakfast. There are just too may variables for EVERYTHING to be EXACTLY the same, so your brain activity has to be a little different.  Second, along the same lines, neural activity is noisy; a lot of what is going on in your head seems random and unpredictable based on our current understanding of neuroscience. Therefore, we wouldn't expect the EXACT same neural activity the second time, just because of random noise.  Now for your second question; yes, the muscles used for both running and walking are controlled by neurons in the same overall part of the brain. Primary motor cortex is located roughly half way between the front and back of your brain. The neurons in this area that control different parts of the body are arranged in a map next to each other; running and walking will both involve neurons controlling the legs muscles.

I.E. skills at throwing a baseball start as say 50 various pathways for a novice but 4-5 perfect pathways for a pro. If that makes sense? For an add-on to this answer to your second question, there will also be other discrete areas of the brain involved that MAY vary between those things.

askscience,3diidk,Anivair,14,Thu Jul 16 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes, but I suppose it depends how old you are.  Long answer: Normal main sequence stars, similar to our sun, tend to go out in one of two ways, depending on their mass. Stars that are less massive than 8x the sun tend to burn hydrogen for several billion years, before swelling into a giant phase. As a giant, it sheds much of it's outer envelope of gas, producing a spectacular nebula. This is the Helix nebula, it's one of my favorites, and it's a cloud that was produced when that little dot in the middle pooped off its outer layers.  What's left is doomed to become a white dwarf. White dwarves are balls of matter, close to the mass of the sun, but about the size of the earth. No longer sustaining fusion to keep themselves hot and active, they spend the rest of time contracting and cooling, although I should say that this cooling takes billions of years. Of course, the timescale for this part of the evolution is quite long compared to the lifespan of a human on earth. I don't think it's fair to say that it died during your lifetime, but rather that it was dying during your lifetime.   On the other hand, stars more than about 8x the mass of the sun tend to die in core collapse supernova. They look like this - that's the Crab nebula. It exploded in 1054 and was observed by Chinese astronomers and visible for a few months in the night sky. It would have been the brightest thing in the night sky except for the moon, and would have been visible during the day. Indeed, if there was a supernova close enough to the earth, you could expect to cast two shadows during the day.  When a supernova goes off, it's generally over in seconds, so I think it's fair to say that a star can die by a supernova during your lifetime, and astronomers observe plenty of them a year. In fact, the average galaxy has about 1 supernova per century, and with about 100 billion to 1 trillion galaxies in the observable universe, that means a supernova goes off almost every 10 milliseconds!  Of course, most of them are too far away to be visible, but once in a while we get lucky and see them in our neighborhood. If you were lucky enough to be alive in 1987, a supernova was observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a nearby satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. That supernova is called 1987a, and is one of our best data points for how supernova go off, and for how neutrinos behave. It would have been visible to the naked eye, just like SN 1054 observed by the Chinese, and would have similarly grown in brightness for some time before fading from view.   Unfortunately I wasn't around to see this one, and I've been hoping for a galactic supernova during my lifetime, and hopefully sooner rather than later. They're great objects for doing physics- they're the only known system where all four fundamental forces play a comparably important role in the evolution."

Sadly, I was born three years too late to see it, despite being in one of the best places in the world to view the LMC.  I still look up at that hazy patch in the sky sometime, hoping for another supernova to go off.  Going by the fact that the Tarantula Nebula is the most active star-forming region in the Local Group of galaxies, and contains some enormous stars (including R136a1, the most massive and luminous star known), it could happen very soon."

So, I don't believe any ""naked eye"" stars have gone supernova in human timescales.  Another way to think about it is that all of the supernova we have ""observed"" happened way before you and I were born. In order for a supernova to have actually occured in our liftime, it would have to be approximately less than or equal to 100 light years away.

askscience,3dhx9h,B3R3N,13,Thu Jul 16 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"There are no (nontrivial) global conservation laws for energy in GR. There are some spacetimes in which conservation laws can hold, but there is no law that holds for all spacetimes. That is, the statement that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" is not necessarily true in GR. Indeed, energy conservation typically is a consequence of time-homogeneity of an associated Lagrangian function. But since the universe is expanding, it is clearly not time-homogeneous.  That being said, the concept of heat death of the universe is likely the closest to what you are asking. The idea is that the universe will achieve thermal equilibrium; the free energy is zero. That is, no work can be performed via temperature differences. One problem with such a proposition is that it is not clear how we should define the entropy of the universe (particularly, a gravitational field), whence the question of whether the universe will achieve maximal entropy is not, at the moment, precisely stated. It's not even clear whether a gravitational field can be described by thermodynamics.  This is about the limit of my knowledge on the subject. It seems to me also that since dark energy remains more or less at constant density as the universe expands, then this energy can be viewed as just sort of appearing out of nowhere. (This goes back to what I stated earlier about the lack of global conservation laws.) An expert in cosmology can much better answer the fine details."

You have to seal the container and put the reaction under an atmosphere that doesn't react.  This can be Nitrogen for some compounds, but others require Argon instead because Nitrogen can still react with some of the stronger bases.  Compounds are added and removed through something such as rubber septum which maintains the atmosphere.  Often the reagents are made when you need them as storing them can be troublesome.  So what you do is keep the reagents on hand that can make the superbase and when you go to run the reaction you put the reactants in, seal the container, and make the super base.  Then once it is made you add whatever you plan on reacting with it.   There are also special chambers one can use if you are working with something particularly sensitive like a pyrophoric compound for instance.   http://web.ornl.gov/sci/ees/bsd/bst/resources/anaerobic%20chamber1.jpg  There's probably a few other techniques I'm forgetting, but that should give you a rough idea of how it works."

askscience,3dephb,Uraneia,3,Wed Jul 15 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"When is the next press conference going to take place? Will it be on Friday?  I'm terribly excited about the tholins. Right now my prediction for the difference in the IR spectra of equatorial and polar methane deposits is that the dark regions, including the 'whale' (which I can't remember the new name for right now, it was mentioned briefly during the presentation; the 'heart' of course is Tombaugh regio) and the 'spots' as well as darker mid-latitude regions methane is colocalised with a more complex mix of hydrocarbons and polyamines, whereas the methane at the poles is much purer and may only contain small amounts of low-mass alkanes. Essentially, I'm guessing that more volatile compounds may desorb from any point on the surface and condense at the poles, whereas larger molecules can only be moved around by geomechanical processes. But I may be way of the mark, of course. So Charon may be goelogically active as well! Either the age of the system is revised after the surface of Charon is aged or a new mechanism for the geology of these icy bodies may be at play. Also intrigued by Charon's polar cap - I wonder if there is some crazy transport mechanism of alkanes from Pluto to Charon, e.g. sublimation of ices from the surface and transport of lower mass alkanes by the atmosphere, where they may react with Charon's surface before being lost to space. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes peeled for new data - hopefully more spectroscopy."

askscience,3dgdb0,Noicce,31,Thu Jul 16 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"If you had a gram of an element with a short half-life (maybe an hour or so) what would you observe?   Typical decay energy is on the order of tens of thousands to a million electron volts per decay. To put this in perspective, the burning of sodium in chlorine gas to form table salt, releases a puny 4.7 eV per atom. So the energy released would be hundreds of thousands of times more than any mundane chemical reaction.  If the isotope only had a half life of an hour, the sample would melt and then vaporize extremely quickly. This would probably also melt the container holding it in short order.  If the sample was in a solution, the solvent would boil away rapidly, followed by the vaporization of the sample itself. the solution would heat rapidly even if quite a small amount was dissolved, a few micrograms, for example.  This would be particularly true of alpha an beta emitters, which is how the vast majority of radioisotopes decay. Alpha and beta particles have poor penetrating power, so the decay energy would be deposited inside the sample itself, or very nearby.   In the case of gamma emitters, this would not necessarily be true, because gamma rays have high penetrating power. So the energy given off by the sample would be distributed over a much larger volume surrounding the sample. The air surrounding the sample container would give off a ghostly blue glow as a result of the gamma rays ionizing air molecules.  One gram of a gamma emitting isotope with a very short half life would be almost impossible to handle. Nobody could get anywhere near the sample container without receiving a life threatening dose of radiation, and the gamma rays would rapidly damage any electronic devices such as cameras and robots used to handle it remotely."
askscience,3dgdb0,W_O_M_B_A_T,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:52 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thank you!  Since a material of such short half-life would relase so much energy - what would be the energy released by a longer-decating material? For example, would a 'ball' of Pu-239 or U-235 (95% pure let's say) be warm in touch?"
askscience,3dgdb0,Barcelus,9,Thu Jul 16 07:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, it'll be warm to the touch. If you insulate it— so that the heat it generates doesn't escape— it'll get hotter and hotter.  A blob of plutonium and some thermocouples and a heat sink makes a fairly long-lived power source, a ""nuclear battery"" which is very simple and reliable. These are used in deep-space probes, Cold War Russian arctic lighthouses, and once upon a time they were used in pacemakers."
askscience,3dgdb0,Problem119V-0800,5,Thu Jul 16 07:46:31 2015 UTC,It is worth noting that the plutonium used in those devices is not the same as the plutonium used in weapons.

They put an insulating blanket over it to let it heat up more.  It gives you some idea of how hot something with a half-life of only an hour would get."
askscience,3dgdb0,koshgeo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:41:15 2015 UTC,"Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 700 million years. This means that the heat energy output is (except for fission) slow enough that it would be difficult to measure. However heat produced by the decay of uranium, and from the decay of it's ""daughter products,"" is believed to be mostly responsible for keeping the earth's outer core and mantle liquid.  Plutonium-239 (the main fissionable isotope of Pu) has a half-life of about 24,000 years. Note that this equates to a difference of 4 orders of magnitude, and therefore four orders of magnitude more heat production. So yes, people who have handled large amounts of Pu directly have reported that it's warm to the touch. This is dangerous to do though, because plutonium is highly toxic.  One of Pu's other isotopes is Pu-238 with a half life of about 88 years. This means it produces significant heat output, one kilogram of the isotope can generate 570 watts of heat. Of course this heat output slowly decreases over time as more and more of the isotope decays.  This makes Pu-239 useful as a heat source in Thermoelectric Generators for certain special applications."

The only time you would see anything is if there is a very large radiation field.  In that case you may see flashes of light when you have your eyes closed.  This could happen due to the Cherenkov radiation.   It would be similar to this.  An hour half life is actually fairly long.  Half-lives range from nanoseconds up to billion billion billion years.  You are looking at around 34 orders of magnitude.    For fun I decided to calculate the activity for a gram of something with an hour half-life.  Bi-212 has a one hour half-life.  The specific activity is 1.5e7 Ci/g.  So that is 15 Megacuries for one gram.  What would you see?  Doesn't matter, you are dead.  At one foot you are looking at around 3000 rem per second.  450 rem is the Ld 50/30, half the population exposed  would die within 30 days with that dose.

Not to measure with laboratory precision, but to test a location or object roughly for such radiation. (I don't plan to go anywhere special, I'm just curious.)"
askscience,3dgdb0,king_of_the_universe,3,Thu Jul 16 14:20:23 2015 UTC,"There are special kinds for different kinds of radiation. A general Geiger counter will detect any ionizing radiation, but the penetration depths of the three major types are very different. If you want to measure the activity of an alpha source in air, you pretty much have to put the detector right on top of it. Negative betas are similar, but they penetrate farther through air (positive betas annihilate very quickly in air). For gammas, you can detect them from far away, but some of them will pass through your detector unseen. If you just want to play around with it, any simple Geiger counter should do. Try it out on a banana or a concrete wall. Or even just listen to the occasional click due to cosmic muons."
askscience,3dgdb0,RobusEtCeleritas,6,Thu Jul 16 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"Radioactive decay doesn't produce light directly. It does produce fast-moving electrons, which will create Cherenkov radiation and glow blue if it's underwater. There's also an unrelated blue flash that will occur in a criticality accident due to ionizing the air.  Nobelium-259 has a half life of 58 minutes, so let's use that. It mostly decays into Fermium-255 and helium. Fermium-255 has a half-life of about 20 hours, so it won't make too much of a difference. That's still only about 75% of the decay, but we'll assume the other decay modes produce similar energy. It works out that it will produce 565 kW of power. This is approximately the maximum power output of an 18-wheeler. I figure it's going to be glowing pretty brightly from the heat."

The smallest feature a microscope can see is slightly less than half the wavelength of the light it focuses.  Visible photons have a wavelength of 400-700 nanometers, and are much too ""big"" to image a uranium nucleus - which is about 266 million times smaller than the wavelength of purple light.  So on the microscopic level you'll see nothing, and I'm not sure it makes sense to ask what happens with a no-limit microscope because it involves quantum tunneling and just sort of goes from intact nucleus to broken nucleus.  On the macroscopic level you'll see a chunk of glowing-hot metal."

If we were patient and used a longer-lived half-life so that the sample doesn't melt or boil away due to the released energy, after waiting a very long time the material would likely look very different. The changed atomic nuclei would have excess or insufficient electric charge, which would affect the electronic interactions between the atoms in the material, directly altering the chemical (and therefore likely visible) properties of the substance."

Alpha decay is basically when something sheds helium atoms.  So whatever your isotope is would, at least initially, transition half of itself into whatever is two numbers lower on the periodic table.  This could mean things like a change from solid to a liquid, for example an alpha decay of rubidium into bromine.  How long the bromine sticks around is dependent on how stable the resulting isotope is.  It should be noted that the transition would not be instantaneous, but gradual over the half life period with a rough total of half changed at the hour mark."
askscience,3dgdb0,Ingram2525,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:19:19 2015 UTC,So what would it look like? Would you see bubbles of bromine forming as tiny grains on the rubidium?
askscience,3dgdb0,Unokaa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say.  There's no real way to determine which parts of the sample would change, so some of the initial sample would change on the outside and some on the inside.

askscience,3dh10z,justifiedanne,8,Thu Jul 16 07:13:18 2015 UTC,This very problem was studied in 2007.  http://www.pnas.org/content/104/42/16432.full  Basically the probability of knot formation is principally a function of the length of the string. The amount of agitation and the string stiffness also contribute.  In their model of knot formation they note that in any confined space a given length of string is likely to coil and this results in a series of essentially parallel strands. With modest amounts of agitation either end of the string can move over the other parallel strands and form braids. The note that all mathematically possible prime knots are possible through such braiding moves. The probability of a knot forming approaches 100% as the number of initial parallel strands approaches 8 or the number of braiding moves approaches 30 (see figure 7).

Thanks for the reply.  Edit: I have biological background, so my first thought was I wonder if/how this relates to dna packing in a cell.

There are a nearly infinite number of 'knots', tolopogical arrangements, that your headphone wires could end up as. There is only one arrangements we would call ""untangled"". You throw a randomizer like your pocket, and after enough agitation, you are very unlikely to end up with nice wires.   This is also how felt works.

askscience,3dk5o6,blazingkin,4,Thu Jul 16 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"Fundamentally, friction is a consequence of the electromagnetic force."
askscience,3dk5o6,fishify,0,Fri Jul 17 00:46:09 2015 UTC,"So here's how my physics prof explained it: Say you have two surfaces, flat on the molecular level, each atom in the same plane for each surface. If these two surfaces were placed against each other, (assuming no molecular forces) there would be a very close to no-friction system.   Now, this is difficult to come by in the real world, as even something that felt really smooth to touch like a cut diamond would in fact be jagged on its planar surface, at some level.  If it were met with another surface there would be resistance to shear forces due to the various peaks of one side colliding with the peaks of another.   So if you were to take two pieces of low-grit sandpaper and try to rub them together it is harder than rubbing two high-grit pieces together. Why? Because the peaks and troughs of the low-grit sandpaper are larger, meaning each peak has to travel farther in the vertical plane before it goes horizontal thus, more resistance to horizontal motion. The high-grit sandpaper has proportionally less space between the peaks and troughs so it would be easier for the peaks to climb over each other and thus easier horizontal motion.   TLDR: While molecular forces play a part, every object has a degree of ""roughness"" that when rubbed on another object, makes it harder to move."
askscience,3dk5o6,lpmiller83092,4,Fri Jul 17 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"This is a good approximation and conceptual idea used in early physics courses (and mechanics courses), actual friction is caused by em interactions."

askscience,3dcimg,LegendofPedro,11,Wed Jul 15 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think using terms like phase and group velocity in this case is misleading.   The motion of the stars in the spiral arms of the galaxy is neither a longitudinal or transverse wave. Or really a wave at all. It's not like sound waves in air where molecules bump into each other and transmit the pulse forward through collision. It's also not like a transverse wave where by definition, the stars wouldn't orbit the galactic center. They would just bob up and down in and out of the plane of the galaxy like a pulse moving down a string.   The stars farther from the center will orbit more slowly than those nearer the center by virtue of the fact that they must travel farther to do so. So the sprial arms we see aren't permanent fixtures in the galaxy, at least by my understanding, but rather just regions of temporarily increased density that can and will change as the stars that make up each arm continue about their orbit. The net effect is that the outer edge of each arm seems to drag behind center, causing the arm to stretch and lag until eventually the density of the galaxy has reaaranged such that what was associated with one arm has now become a new arm.  Corrections to this are welcome, I'm by no means an expert."

The cars move through the traffic jam: the density of cars increases in the middle of it. The traffic jam itself, however, does not move (or not a great deal, in comparison to the cars). In the galaxy, stars, gas, dust, and other components move through the density waves, are compressed, and then move out of them."

Also, the central black hole is negligible unless you live right next door to the central black hole. The milky way isn't a gigantic accretion disk for the black hole, the black hole is there because of the way the milky way formed. It represents less than .01% of the total galactic mass, there are only a couple dozen stars that feel it's pull in any meaningful way.   Also, centrifugal forces don't exist. There is no force pushing anything out from the center."

One important distinction, however, is that although the black hole is growing in mass, the gravitational force we experience is no different because we are attracted to ALL the mass in the galaxy (and universe to be pedantic).

So while they may have had more time to develop, they have less variety of building blocks to play with. Of course, it took a third of the current age of the Universe for Earth to develop life capable of considering these questions, so if another planet of the same age as Earth had biological evolution towards human-equivalent intelligence that happened just 1% faster, they would still be some 46 million years ahead of us."

If this hypothesis is sound it would only require the conditions needed to host bacteria, and then life itself would gradually transform the planet over billions of years. The primary requirement in such a case is pressureand temperatures which enable a great degree of liquid water and hydrocarbons to exist. These conditions appear to be quite rare, but with the sheer number of planets out there, it may still translate to an incomprehensible amount of worlds with intelligent life on them."

If two astronauts pass each other at 0.9c and neither one of them is accelerating they both see the other as aging slower and neither astronaut can tell which one is moving and which is stationary.  Doesn't make sense does it?  Because if they ever met up again they would both expect to see the other as having aged less than themselves.    HOWEVER!!!  In order for them to meet up with each other one of them is going to have to start accelerating towards the other.  This is where my knowledge gets a little fuzzy because I read about all of this about a decade ago, but by accelerating your inertial frame of reference changes such that anyone observing you can tell that you are indeed moving.  So the stationary astronaut is sitting there watching the accelerating astronaut moving towards them and seeing that the accelerating astronaut's time is indeed moving slower than their own.  Equally the accelerating astronaut knows they are moving because they can feel the Gs and they can now also see that their time is moving slower than the stationary astronaut.  When they finally meet up the astronaut who was sitting there the whole time is terribly aged and a little miffed that they didn't do any accelerating.  WARNING  I am a layman and know nothing of the maths.  I just read a load of books about this when I was younger and sort of grasped the rudiments.  As a result, the above will likely contain huge inaccuracies, but I think I got the basics."

askscience,3dcimg,Iyagovos,3,Wed Jul 15 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"An active black hole is one that is currently swallowing matter, either straight in or through an accretion disk. This causes it to glow because it's surrounded by hot gas. An 'inactive' or quiescent black hole isn't swallowing anything so you don't see high energy light from it.  They're not sinkholes any more than anything else. A 10 solar mass star has a stronger gravitational field field than a 5 solar mass black hole at a distance; it's just that black holes are very dense. If a living star had an event horizon it would be inside the star (and the star is too spread out to create such a sharp spike in the gravitational field anyway.)  tl;dr: Active just means it's eating stuff, and black holes use the same gravity as everything else. They're only weird when you're very close to them."
askscience,3dcimg,ErmagerdSpace,2,Wed Jul 15 13:54:58 2015 UTC,"A sinkhole is an interesting comparison but I still like to think of them as stars. They are just the most massive stars possible, so massive that not even the light of all the energy it contains and all the energy it devours due it's intense gravity is able to escape.    Inactivity or dormancy in a black whole is basically when there is nothing nearby for it to immediately start eating. The black hole becomes active when a partner star starts to have it's material stripped from it due to the gravity of the black hole. After the star (or multiple stars) is completely consumed the black hole will go dormant because there is nothing nearby to be pulled into it. At this time there would be no extra x-ray and/or gamma ray bursts emanating from it.    After some time though, eventually ""nearby"" stars will eventually become closer and the process will start again.    The galactic nuclei becomes active, or wakes up, from dormancy when it starts stripping material from stars again, which in turn causes gamma ray bursts and all sorts of radiation from the accretion disk. And that's how we know they are active :)"

Therefore, when searching for places where life may exist, especially Earth-like life, it's best to look for places similar to our home. We don't know what might prevent life from forming.

As /u/zabblleon touched on, planets in their habitable zones are likely to become tidally locked, which would make for extreme weather conditions, and likely restrict life to regions near the day/night terminator.  On top of that, the fact that red dwarfs are very magnetically active means that they're basically always variable stars - young ones produce very powerful flares that could destroy a habitable planet's ozone layer, accelerate atmosphere loss, and cause brief temperature spikes (the flare stars/UV Ceti variales), and even older ones tend to have high starspot activity that can reduce the total stellar output by several percent (BY Draconis variables).

askscience,3dcimg,cptkirchhoff,7,Wed Jul 15 13:37:41 2015 UTC,"The Sun is not only made up hydrogen for a two different reasons:   The Sun formed from the remnants of old stars, so there are atoms in the Sun that were fused billions of years ago by a star long dead. (For more info, look at the difference between Population I stars, like the Sun, and Population II stars, that have no/low metallicity.) The Sun does not only make helium by fusion in its core. Though two hydrogens fusing into one helium is the preferred pathway; that is, the one that occurs most often, it is not the only one. By different pathways of fusion, the Sun has made Carbon, Oxygen, Lithium, etc., even though the vast majority of its energy comes from hydrogen being fused into helium. (That will change by the way as the Sun gets older.) For more info here, look up the difference between the pp chain and the CHO chain? It might be CHO cycle.

Some stars ""switch"" to helium fusion (then oxygen, etc. Up to iron) at some point if they are massive enough.  If memory serves, ours will expand as it uses up the remainder of its hydrogen fuel and the contact into a cooling white dwarf.

askscience,3dcimg,MindSpices,5,Wed Jul 15 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"This is a common misconception:   ""If you go out and look at the all visible stars in the night sky and ask, 'How many of those are binary?' the answer is, 'Most of them,'"" said study author Charles Lada of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). ""The assumption was that because most bright stars were binaries, all stars would tend to be binaries."" The catch, however, is that most stars in the Milky Way are not bright stars like our Sun, but dim, low-mass stars called red dwarfs.   Most stars visible to the naked eye are binaries.  There are a lot more stars than that though.  Back to the original question:  average distance between stars comes out to 4-5 lightyears.  It's not clear what this average distance is referring to exactly however.  There are different sets of stars you could look at that will give you wildly different answers.  The galactic arms will have a higher density so all those stars will likely be closer to another star.  In between the galactic arms but still in the galactic disk (where the Sun is) would be lower than that.  In the galactic halo outside the main disk stars will be much sparser so would likely be much much farther away from other stars.  The closest star to the sun is Proxima Centauri at 4.24lightyears.  So it fits neatly in with the average prediction, but how that compares to other stars in the galactic disk, not sure."

Our sun grew up in such a place and then dispersed over the last 4.5-5 gigayears. We have no real idea where our sun came from. The genealogy of our sun is almost totally unknown.  IN the globular clusters stars might be only 1/2 to 1 LY from others. No one knows how the globular star clusters got so tightly packed. & why there are so few red dwarf stars there. But it could be dark matter in a tight, local knot which creates them. so Maybe observing closely for fine structure of globular clusters will give us insights into what dark matter/energy are composed of."

You can get the density of stars from that by dividing the number of stars by the volume they are in: 260,000 / (4/3 Pi 2503) = 0.004 stars per lightyear cubed. This Wikipedia page actually states the same number, so who knows.  We probably don't know every star within 250 light years of us, so that number would be a lower limit on the local density of stars. Keep that in mind. That number can be converted (by multiplying the top and bottom by 103) to 4 stars per 10 lightyears cubed. So lets count the number of stars within 10 lightyears from us and see.  Using this Wikipedia page and ignoring brown dwarfs (the L and T stars), I count 12 stars within 10 lightyears. Using this Wikipedia page, which has stars with an absolute magnitude of 8.5 or brighter, I count 4 stars within 10 lightyears.

One concept that I had trouble learning about in biology courses was idea of altruism. It's basically the most severe form of selflessness and absolute helpfulness. For example, if I jumped in front of a bullet for someone, disregarding my well-being to help them, that is altruistic. It's seen in many, many species of animals - more so the ones that are highly social like Meerkats.  Humans aside, some living things are genuinely good"
askscience,3dhukb,Branden_B,3,Thu Jul 16 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well, to modify this a little, complete altruism--the willingness to sacrifice one's self for any member of the species--is selected against. The commonly used example is the outdated idea that lemmings would commit mass suicide to prevent overpopulation. All it takes is one lemming to decide not to do this, then pass on this ""selfish"" trait to its offspring, and within a few generations it spreads to the entire population.  However, what is fairly common is kin selection--the willingness to sacrifice one's self for any individual that is closely related. Because this is still ultimately protecting one's own genes, this can be selected for. In species like meerkats, that spend their whole lives in family groups, the end result is effectively the same as altruism. But you wouldn't expect this behavior in animals without a family structure."
askscience,3dhukb,loki130,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"In the past few years we've found increasingly compelling evidence of what humans describe as 'altruism' in a number of species. Perhaps the study that received the most press was one using rats, in which it was found that a rat will go out of its way (physically exert itself, or even give up the opportunity to eat a bunch of chocolate chips) in order to free a fellow rat from a cage. (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-you-rat-me-out/)  The thing to keep in mind with this sort of study is that 'true' altruism is rare, even in humans. Social animals benefit from having other members of their species nearby and safe/healthy, due to safety in numbers and the added efficiency of hunting or foraging with group-mates. For example, ravens will 'selflessly' call other ravens to them when they find a dead animal to eat, but this is often because the animal has been found on the territory of a more dominant raven, and calling in other intruders can help fend off the aggressive resident. (http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/26/rationing-ravens-merciful-monkeys-can-animals-be-altruistic) Generally the term 'reciprocity' is preferred over 'altruism' in these cases.  You asked specifically about fish and reptiles: I don't know of many well-documented cases in fish, though there's the famous example of cleaner wrasse fish nibbling harmful parasites off of larger fish (of course, the wrasse get a meal out of that!) Blue-throated side-blotched lizards are known to team up in pairs of males to cooperatively defend a territory and help each other attract mates, and one will sometimes even give up its chance to reproduce so that the other one can. (http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/lizards_provide_evidence_for_a_theory_of_altruism/) The caveat? These partnerships were always formed between lizards who were related to one another, resulting in indirect fitness when the other lizard reproduced. But this kind of mutualism between related individuals is particularly common throughout many species."

There are a few ideas out there about potential ways to determine atmospheric O2 concentration that far back in time. They are: Stomatal density of fossil leaves; stable carbon isotope ratios of soil carbonates (pedogenic carbonate); stable carbon isotope ratios of fossilized amber; and numerical mass balance modeling. There's a pretty decent review of all these here (Tappert et al., 2013).   The proxy record of oxygen history (with big, big error bars and caveats in mind) is that atmospheric O2 was ~10% (% of the atmosphere, today it is 21%) until 70 million years ago, when it jumped to 15%. Around 50 million years ago it fell rapidly to 10% again, before slowly increasing over the past 50 million years to the present value of ~21%.   The mass balance model indicates that atmospheric O2 began slowly increasing from 10% to modern values about 140 million years ago. So, at the beginning of the Cretaceous, oxygen was 10%, and at the end of the Cretaceous, oxygen would have been close to 15%-17%. I'm not sure what human tolerance for oxygen is (not very scientific google searching revealed 19.5% as the minimum amount for breathing, but I don't know if that's right!).  Hope this helps!"

The 15%-35% number comes from sedimentary charcoal records - this is the oxygen concentration window within which combustion reactions can occur and form charcoal. The idea is that wherever there is charcoal in the sedimentary record, atmospheric O2 must have been between 15 and 35%. The authors of the paper I first cited offer a few criticisms of this idea - mainly that wind could decrease the amount of O2 necessary, and that the charring process of charcoal formation requires low O2, even though combustion requires 15%-35%.  Accuracy is in the eye of the beholder on this matter, I think. People who trust in charcoal records, and their subsequent conversion to %O2, calculate 26-30% oxygen during the Cretaceous. People who trust in carbon isotopes in plant matter calculate 10-15%. Some sort of independent verification would be excellent, but right now we don't really have any..."

askscience,3di6h3,ThisTwoFace,4,Thu Jul 16 13:52:24 2015 UTC,"The theories arguing that oil is ""abiotic"" (i.e. not derived from fossils) have been discredited on any number of grounds. This wikipedia article on abiotic or abiogenic oil formation provides a nice overview of some of the theories and the (copious) arguments against said theories. This paper (link to pdf and link to journal page), which is cited in the wikipedia article, provides a more technical breakdown of some of the problems with these arguments. The highlights from both the article and the wikipedia entry are that thermodynamically, the reactions argued for in the theories to produce complex hydrocarbons found in petroleum deposits, are not possible and that the abiotic origin theories do not adequately explain the presence of biomarkers within petroleum deposits. The TL;DR version is that abiotic oil doesn't really work with anything we know about the chemistry of petroleum or geology in general.  When you remove abiotic oil as a feasible process, you are left with the inescapable conclusion that oil is indeed a non-renewable resource. Technically, even with abiotic oil, it would be non-renewable, but the idea was that the rate of production or quantity produced would be such that we wouldn't have to be concerned with running out. But, because abiotic oil formation makes no sense, we are left with petroleum forming processes that require very specific conditions (high accumulations of biomass in shallow aquatic environments that are rapidly buried, heated to just the right temperature, and are able to migrate to a reservoir that is feasible from which it is feasible to extract) forming at a rate which is hugely outpaced by the rate at which we extract it. Thus, oil is ""renewable"" in the sense that more is and will be produced, but for all intents and purposes it is non-renewable because the rate of production is incredibly slow compared to the rate at which we remove it and use it."
askscience,3di6h3,CrustalTrudger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"So, it's not well conclusive whether or not the complex hydrocarbons are created in the mantle as opposed to organic origin but the evidences of [them] being biotic-originated are more conclusive?  It's pretty intriguing, none the less. It seems as though the theory of abiotic formation of hydrocarbons has a few flaws, but I would like to see more work on it and see the flaws worked through to conclude whether or not it has a firm ground in the science community.  As I see it, we cannot assume that it is as renewable as the theory implies because it is so heavy relied upon, it is also dirty pollutants, therefor we should be looking for other means of energy.  Edit: I'm also going to ask a few follow-up questions... Hold on...     Are there any locations where biomass is located and hydrocarbons not? And are there any locations where hydrocarbons are located and biomass not located? Are most of commercial oilfields located near faultlines, or are they fairly even spread across the crust? If hydrocarbons are proven to be ""renewable"", or more evidence is found that backs up the claims these scientists are speaking, do you think the scientific community would be of more accepting of this theory?"
askscience,3di6h3,CrustalTrudger,3,Thu Jul 16 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"These (abiotic formation of oil / oil from the mantle) are not new theories that haven't yet had enough work to demonstrate them, these are old theories that in no way, shape, or form make sense with the data we have today. Staying within the realm of geology for an analogy, the desire for more work investigating the potential for abiotic oil is akin to being distrustful of this whole ""plate tectonics"" thing and wanting more in-depth analysis of the potential that the geosyncline hypothesis was right after all.  To answer your questions:   Are there any locations where biomass is located and hydrocarbons not? And are there any locations where hydrocarbons are located and biomass not located?   No, all deposits of oil and natural gas occur in the types of geologic environments (deposits within areas that were formally shallow marine or large lake settings) we expect them to based on our current understanding of how oil and natural gas deposits form.    Are most of commercial oilfields located near faultlines, or are they fairly even spread across the crust?   Neither, as described above, economically viable oil fields occur in regions that were formally shallow marine or lake environments at the time that the source material was deposited. It is not uncommon that oil fields are deformed (i.e. are faulted and folded), and in fact these structures are often essential in producing traps (places where oil accumulates) and seals (barriers to fluid migration). Importantly, there are very faults that penetrate down to the mantle (and none really do as discrete, continuous planes), but the faults in most of the crust and oil fields don't go that deep (10-20 km). One of the few places we consistently find faults that reach the mantle in any real way are subduction zones. If there was any validity to the ""oil from the mantle"" ideas, this is where you'd expect to see oil deposits, but it is decidedly not where we see oil deposits.   If hydrocarbons are proven to be ""renewable"", or more evidence is found that backs up the claims these scientists are speaking, do you think the scientific community would be of more accepting of this theory?   They are not renewable as described in this answer and my previous one, so this is a moot point.  As an aside, there is a significant body of research in the academic sphere in relation to oil formation, etc, all of which point to a biotic origin for oil, but there is an exponentially larger body of research within the oil industry itself, all of which again demonstrate a biotic origin for oil. Oil companies are businesses that depend on the ability to efficiently find and extract oil. There is no reason for them to cling to a particular view of oil formation unless it is predictive for finding oil (and maximizing their profits). Thus, our ability to find and develop new oil fields based on our traditional understanding of how petroleum resources develop is a pretty good test of the theories themselves."

askscience,3di6h3,CrustalTrudger,0,Thu Jul 16 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"No. The vast majority of our oil came about during a period of earth's history called the Carboniferous period.

These uncomposted plants, were gradually transformed into oil. Today, bacteria and molds breakdown dead plant life, and no new oil is formed. Secondly, our oil did not come from dinosaurs or any other large fauna. The biomass was simply not large enough to create any significant quantity of oil."

This equation can be helpful in thinking of how this happens. The cardiac output is the amount of blood that your heart can pump per minute. Heart rate is self-explanatory and Stroke volume is the volume of blood that's ejected by the left ventricle during a contraction.  If you lose loads of blood, then stroke volume falls, so in order to maintain cardiac output, the Heart rate rises. The exact mechanisms of this occuring are complex with input from the nervous system and the adrenal glands."

askscience,3dihdc,_madmonkey,2,Thu Jul 16 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"There are many different kinds of colorblindness. You can read about them on the wiki.   Generally, we can say that there are 3 coarse distinctions (although there are many more types):   1) you are missing one of the three cone types (dichromacy)  2) you have a color anomaly -- the sensitivity of one or more of the cone types deviates from normal making it more similar to another cone type and therefore making it more difficult to discriminate between wavelengths that both of those cone types are sensitive to  3) cortical or cerebral achromatopsia - colorblindness caused by brain damage.  Most causes of colorblindness are genetic, but can also result from various diseases that affect the eye or from damage to the retina.   The EnChroma glasses are best at helping with the second type. They are essentially a special kind of filter that blocks the wavelengths of light that stimulate photoreceptors with overlapping sensitivities. So if you've got two receptors that are supposed to be maximally sensitive to medium and long wavelengths, but the medium one's sensitivity is shifted into the longer range, the glasses will filter out the intermediate wavelengths but allow the longest (that mostly stimulate the long cones) and the shorter ones (that mostly stimulate the medium cones) through. This differential activation of photoreceptors is what enables you to see colors. You can read about it on their website here.  That is, it's not that stimulating a single photoreceptor produces a color sensation. That's why it's misleading to call them ""red"" ""green"" and ""blue"" cones. You need at least two cones in order to be able to tease apart differences in wavelengths (which we experience as color) from differences in intensity (amount of light), since both of these can affect the firing of a single receptor."

However, considering the vast difference in nervous system development (including the brain), it is plausible that the perception of pain and suffering isn't nearly as intense or daunting due to the enormous difference in brain development. However again, it's been shown that crustaceans display a memory of painful events in their behavior and can be conditioned to a degree. Really the answer is, we do know they have reflexes for stimuli, and they have a sense of touch, what we don't know is if the implications of pain and agony are perceived the same, especially with the huge rift in condition.

Seafood and especially shellfish/crustaceans are at their best when they are as fresh as they can possibly be. As spoilage happens rapidly for seafood. Keeping your shellfish alive until the last possible moment your cook them guarantees they will remain fresh and taste as good as they might. If you're cooking your seafood alive it doesn't really get much fresher than that.  With regards lobsters in many countries it's required that lobsters are killed prior to cooking. There's roughly 3 ways to do this.   Slice through their head and spine cutting through all the ganglia (mini-brains). More or less instantly kills them. Freeze them. Boil water to drive the oxygen out. Let the water cool and place the lobsters in the de-oxygenated water causing them to pass out then suffocate.

My point is that it's obviously far from clear which animals possess consciousness and to what degree. That's why I personally ascribe to the precautionary principle. The negative utility of erroneously believing species X or Y cannot feel pain and so subjecting them to lots of pain should outweigh the negative utility of the opposite scenario where you protect a species from pain only to later realise it was not necessary.  Obviously for practical reasons we can't take our precautions to the extreme. I think we can be somewhat certain that bugs don't have much of a consciousness, for example. And even though we can't know this for certain, avoiding to harm any bugs would be impractical and result in big problems for humanity.  When it comes to a lobster I could easily imagine them being able to experience terrible pain. It's not for certain that basic pain needs a super-complex brain. And even if their suffering is less ""rich"" than ours (which it most likely is, we just have so much more psychology and understanding which should give our suffering additional dimensions), it's still bad and shouldn't be treated as a non-factor.

Additionally, throttling down after Max-Q (i.e. thinning atmosphere) is more efficient, especially if you can maintain the same acceleration.  Rocket launches are a ""race"" in the sense that you need to be travelling sufficiently fast enough to attain orbit, but it's not a race in the sense that you need to get there absolutely as fast-as-possible - this wastes fuel and could jeopardize the integrity of the craft itself.

askscience,3dhq1b,FXelix,7,Thu Jul 16 10:55:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, I guess we should specify that two things usually go on when we cry: there are tears, and there is noise, and that noise can be seen a lot more liberally in children, who have no social reason to inhibit or retard their cries. Anyway, with that in mind we should probably consider the reasons a person may cry.  One reason we cry is when we are in pain, and you'll see this in both humans and animals. Crying allows us to vocalise our pain, and let others know that we are experiencing it. The difference between us and animals in this regard is the tears. Not a lot of animals will well up and shed tears when they cry, but we do. Even our closest evolutionary buddies like apes and chimps don't actually shed tears when they cry, though they do have tear ducts which are used in lubrication of the eye.  So that brings us on to crying as an emotional response. This is something quite unique to us as humans. Some animals will coo and wail when they experience what we can only assume is ""sorrow"" for example, when losing a mother or father, but not shed any tears.   It has been suggested that crying for emotional reasons is something we do for reasons as simple as that it allows us to more clearly and readily communicate our emotional state to others, prompting them to provide us with support or assistance. The maternal instinct that some mothers experience isn't negligible in this regard either.  Michael Trimble wrote an entire book on crying, called ""Why humans like to cry: Tragedy, evolution and the brain."" Sadly, I was only able to read parts of this during my psychology training, but I do recall a point he made which has resonated with me several times in life. He pointed out that as we have evolved, we have become more and more aware and educated about who and what we are, as humans. We grew to understand that other people have similar thoughts and feelings to us, and we learned that we were able to empathise with others because of this. However, sometimes emotions are difficult to express with language and words, because of their complexity, and so crying and laughter are both very fitting communication devices to help people understand how we feel.  This ended up being long and rambling, and I apologise. But this is a topic that is fascinating, and I hope you learn everything that you want to!"

Women on the other hand were raised to care, to love, to take care of the loved ones, tend to them if needed, support them. That is why if a woman experiences something wrong, they react with emotions (crying). Men are driven by reasoning, logical thinking (observe every aspect of the situation, weight out the possibilities, and make a decision).

askscience,3dhdh0,Gotitaila,4,Thu Jul 16 07:49:23 2015 UTC,"Saying that ""the heart is a muscle"" is like saying ""Gouden Carolus is a beer."" Sure, it is, but what a glorious and special beer it is!  There are three different types of muscle, and they're all quite different. One of them is irrelevant to your question (smooth muscle found inside our bodies, such as in the intestines.) and so i'll focus on the two other types of muscle.  The first is ""skeletal muscle"". This is the muscle all over our bodies. These are the muscles you'll see Mr Universe oiling up backstage. We decide when we want to move these muscles, and they help us move our joints, and keep ourselves upright. The process of contracting this type of muscle requires ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) which is essentially ""energy"" and so this is quite an active process, especially when lifting weights as you mentioned. Using your skeletal muscles in this way is oxygen intensive, which is why your heart starts to race when you use them vigorously. (Hey, i'm not judging.) As soon as there's not enough oxygen, your body begins to undergo anaerobic respiration, which causes lactic acid to build up and give you some aching muscles!   The second type of muscle is, you guessed it, cardiac muscle. Now, cardiac muscle is actually really similar to your skeletal muscle. It uses ATP and oxygen, too! So, why does skeletal muscle feel fatigue a lot more readily than cardiac muscle?   Well, firstly, think about your heart. The heart is the blood-pumping organ of the body. Blood collects oxygen from your lungs, and then travels through the heart to be shipped out to the rest of your body. And sitting on your heart are the coronary arteries. Because the oxygenated blood comes through the heart, the blood that travels through the coronary arteries (to feed the heart muscle) is VERY oxygen rich. More oxygen means more aerobic respiration! This effectively means there is no anaerobic respiration in the cardiac muscle, and so no lactic acid build up.   Next, let's talk about the ATP, the ""energy"" we need to use our muscles. We obtain ATP from little structures called ""mitochondria"". Now, mitochondria are pretty abundant in our skeletal muscles, but not nearly as abundant as they are within our cardiac muscle. Our cardiac muscles are bursting at the seams with mitochondria. And as a result, has a much higher amount of ATP (or ""energy"")available for use.   I hope this helped!"
askscience,3dhdh0,TakeOver12,5,Thu Jul 16 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"This is highly inaccurate. I mean (nearly) everything you say is technically correct (the best kind of correct) but it is not really the answer. First of all : The amout of oxygen in the blood in your coronary arteries and in you peripheral arteries does not differ significantly. Of course it does differ a little bit since the endothelia cells and the cellular parts of the blood consume oxygen, but this is not nearly enough to have any impact big enough to change how fast muscles are fatigued.  Now for the rest : Any muscle can work all the time. Skeletal muscle do it too : We always breathe, and all the muscles we use for breathing (diaphragm, intercostal etc) are sceletal muscles. They don't fatigue the same as the heart doesn't. Because if they would we'd be as dead as we are when the heart stopped pumping.  Sceletal muscles fatigue when they go into anaerobic metabolism. THis has nothing to do with the oxygen in the blood, only with the amount of work the muscle does. The heart simply has reservers FAR bigger then the work it actually does, so it never goes into anaerobic metabolism. Also the mitchondria of the hearts are not only plenty like you said, but they are also highly very ""un-picky"" of what the source of the energy is they are producing. A heart cell uses literally everything it finds in the blood, and takes as much as it needs. No other tissue in our body does it, not even the brain (which is actually pretty picky).  And now for the last part : Our heart does fatigue. Everytime when you are completly exhausted, for example after sport, your heart just told you ""Dude, go slower, I can't do this anymore"". As the need of oxygen in your body rises your heart goes faster and faster to pump the blood. At some point the heart just can't pump more blood and this is when you start to feel exhausted, when you get short-breath. You're not actually lacking air or oxygen, you're lacking the ability to get it into the periphery of your body. The lung is still working just fine (the oxygen saturation in your arteries will still be 100%) it's the heart that limits us. It just warns us before it's so done that it actually stops. But try to remember a time when a muscle in your body was so fatigued that you could not move it anymore. Not on tiny bit. It doesn't really happen anywhere in our body, does it?  (btw all this is for a healthy heart. If you have coronary heart disease you will know fatigue of your heart as ""angina pectoris"" which is more or less your heart lacking oxygen because the coronary arteries are clogged. And a lot of sudden cardiac deaths are caused by a fatigued heart)  Hope I could clear some stuff up here..."
askscience,3dhdh0,malefiz123,0,Thu Jul 16 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for not jumping down my throat too hard about this!   Just to clarify, I never said that skeletal muscles can't/don't work all the time, I was just attempting to explain in simple terms why our skeletal muscles do get tired, and then the ways in which cardiac muscle differs from them.   I also never said the skeletal muscle fatigue was caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood. If you go back and read my answer, you'll see that I said that intensive use of skeletal muscles is oxygen intensive, and that when there's no longer enough oxygen to keep up with this work, anaerobic respiration begins. Maybe it's me not being clear enough, but there we go.   Of course there were things I simplified and left out, and I apologise if you felt it was inaccurate, but I have to disagree. I may not have talked about increased oxidative ATP synthesis in the cardiac muscle, but I thought my point was clear enough without going into it. There are countless reasons that the heart experiences less fatigue than our skeletal muscles, and you're of course right that a large part of it boils down to the heart doing a disproportionate amount of work compared to the supply of mitochondria and oxygen it has. But I didn't think it seemed right to get into the fine-grain elements of heart fatigue, like the high mitochondrial density coupled with the prevalence of heart-type lactate dehydrogenase, or the role of those mitochondria in calcium regeneration for contraction.  In any case, thank you for strengthening and correcting my answer in places, I love and have a profound interest in the heart, so am always interested to learn more, if you have anything else you'd like to tell me!

Simply put - the mathematical and direct solution is that you should travel as fast as you can, getting close to instantaneous speed (where you accumulate all of the rain in the volume produced by multiplying your path and your frontal surface area). This minimizes the water accumulated by the top of the head, and thus overall wetness.  The alternate solution involves travelling at an angle equal to the vector produced by the rain's downward velocity and your own forward velocity. If you move while leaning at the perfect angle, you will prevent rain from ever accumulating on your front.  But for all practical purposes, just go as fast as you can."

On the other end of the spectrum, you test out going fast by running at the brisk pace of 100 ft/sec. This means you would get rained on for .01 seconds.

askscience,3dda8f,CreativeArbok,112,Wed Jul 15 10:58:15 2015 UTC,"Well, stars, if they are large enough, CAN fuse iron, as long as it's an iron isotope of 55 or lower. Our star can't fuse iron at all, because it's not big enough either.  The reason is that fusion up until nuclei of 55 protons/neutrons or less will release energy. At nickel and Iron 56 and higher, it TAKES energy to create fusion to higher isotopes.   This is why Andreas Rossi's claim about the E-cat is wrong because he claims energy release from fusing nickel to copper. That's contrary to the laws of physics as most all supernovae have shown.  This is essentially why giant stars SuperNova. Soon as they've fused up to Iron 56, the nuclear fusion energy processes quickly shut down. The star begins to contract because fusion was keeping it large, it compresses to a very tight size, and then it supernovas!! Spewing out much of its mass in neutrinos, light, & mass ejections to spread newly formed metallic elements upwards of well beyond uranium and Pu to seed the local interstellar region. This will eventually create some metal containing stars (& planets) as children many megayears down the line.  The iron in our hemoglobin and cytochromes, and the Cobalt in our B12 vitamins mostly came from supernovae. We are composed of star stuff, of at least one supernova's matter. & We are here, living right now, reading this because of the fact that Fe-56 can't fuse thus releasing energy. Cool, huh?!!"

The star begins to contract because fusion was keeping it large, it compresses to a very tight size, and then it supernovas!!    Just wanted to add that the reason why this collapse results in an explosion is essentially that the collapsing matter bounces against itself. This is often not explained, but is important because it is not immediately clear why a gravitational collapse would result in a supernovae.   It is this collision of the collapsing star against itself which generates the extreme energy release in a supernovae. The process is driven by gravitational potential energy, which is released in the form of intense heat and pressure, as all that iron and nickel collides against itself.  It is a bit strange to think about how all that heat and pressure, (Enough to outshine an entire galaxy!!!) is generated just by stuff falling under the force of gravity, but stars are very big, and the gravity is well in excess of what we're used to here on earth. The core-collapse in a supernovae can basically be seen as a gravity driven particle-accelerator on steroids. The atomic nuclei fall inwards, picking up a tremendous amount of momentum, until they start colliding in the centre, and release all that energy in the form of heat."

askscience,3dda8f,j_mcc99,12,Fri Jul 17 00:21:02 2015 UTC,Why does fusion only release energy up to 55 nucleons?
askscience,3dda8f,no_awning_no_mining,17,Wed Jul 15 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"There are two competing forces in an atom's nucleus: the residual strong force which acts over short distances and binds nucleons (protons and neutrons) together and the electromagnetic force which acts over long distances and tries to push positively-charged protons apart. For small nuclei, the residual strong force wins this tug of war and it's energetically favourable to combine nuclei together. The resulting fused nucleus has less energy than the two reactant nuclei did, so energy is released. Similarly, for a large nucleus the long-range repulsive force dominates and there may be smaller nuclei it can split apart into (radioactive decay, fission) while releasing (rather than absorbing) energy. At 55-60 ish nucleons, the tug-of-war is a tie and you can't increase the binding energy per nucleon by making the nucleus bigger or smaller. A star would lose energy if it fused past the iron group. Elements past iron can be endothermically produced in supernova, however, when massive amounts of a star's gravitational potential energy is released.  Edit:  Just to a clarify a bit more: it's not quite accurate to say something like ""fusion only release[s] energy up to 55 nucleons"" without being a bit more careful about what you mean. What people really mean by statements like this is that fusion of two nuclei that are both heavy will absorb energy beyond the iron group. As a counter example, neutron capture—when a nucleus absorbs a neutron—is technically the ""fusion"" of a nucleus with a single free neutron, we just don't really call it that. This is almost always exothermic for any naturally occurring isotopes, even up various uranium isotopes (and, conversely, the reverse ""fission"" process, neutron emission, can release energy even for some light isotopes like He-5). Similarly, fusion of something heavy with just hydrogen (proton capture) or deuterium can often release energy. Even though the binding energy per nucleon decreases as nuclei get larger beyond the iron group, the total binding energy of the larger nucleus may still be greater. So, fission and fusion really refer, in practice, to splitting or combining nuclei of comparable masses, not reactions between nuclei of very different sizes like neutron and proton capture/emission, alpha decay, and so on. In the case of stellar nucleosynthesis, by the time it reaches iron there aren't any more light nuclei kicking around—they've already fused into heavier nuclei—so the only fusion process that could happen is the fusion of two or more heavy nuclei. This, as discussed above, is not possible."
askscience,3dda8f,Candalever,3,Wed Jul 15 18:53:01 2015 UTC,There are two competing forces in an atom's nucleus: the residual strong force   Why is it called 'residual'? What is it leftover from?
askscience,3dda8f,hatheaded,3,Thu Jul 16 05:19:57 2015 UTC,"From the strong force that holds the quarks inside of protons and neutrons together. A good analogy is the attractive London dispersion force between electrically neutral molecules. Even though two molecules are neutral, they still tend to weakly attract each other over short distances because their positive and negative charges are separated and moving around. Similarly, protons and neutrons are ""colour neutral"" (colour is the name of the charge for the strong force) but can still bind together since they're made up of quarks that have different colours. Considering how strong just the residual strong force is between near by nucleons, you can imagine how strong the strong force itself, acting directly between quarks, must be."
askscience,3dda8f,Candalever,2,Thu Jul 16 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"The strong force operates within the proton or neutron itself. This is not a static thing - it's a constantly changing, boiling process that behaves like a single particle a short distance away, and the net effect of all that nonsense is ""a proton"" or ""a neutron.""  The things we deal with on a daily basis are almost entirely due to either electrodynamics or gravity. At this scale, there's a comparatively tiny amount of energy involved compared to the mass of the thing we're looking at.  On the interior of a nuclear particle, there's such a massive stonking amount of energy about that you get particles popping into and out of existence constantly, and they persist long enough to have a measurable effect. This is that ""boiling"" from earlier.  Once in awhile, a particular composite quark cluster will form out of this boiling mess. It survives long enough to interact with the quarks one nuclear particle (proton or neutron) over.  That once-in-awhile particle is enough to bond the nucleus of an atom together.  Because the charge is being shuffled about by a particle that decays VERY quickly, the residual force has a limited range. This becomes one of the limiting factors on the size of atomic nuclei, since you can eventually stack enough protons together that the net effect of all the electric charges overwhelms the ability of the residual force to hold things together."
askscience,3dda8f,toastydeath,4,Thu Jul 16 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"I once read somewhere that it was hypothesized that if a star about to go supernova somehow absorbed a neutron star into it's core, the added mass would potentially be able to restabilize the star and the star would be able to continue fusion past iron isotopes.

askscience,3dda8f,tinytim0,5,Wed Jul 15 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Other comments go into more detail, but it takes more energy to fuse heavier elements than you get out of the reaction. When a star's core starts fusing iron, it steals energy from the core and the fusion process runs out of gas. Normally, the energy from the fusion reaction pushes on the upper layers of the stars, while gravity pulls down, and the two forces are balanced. Without fusion, there's nothing to counter gravity, so the upper layers fall inwards and slam into the core, which then explodes. The energy involved is plenty to fuse heavier elements than iron, but these still take more energy than they give off, so even if the star hadn't just exploded there wouldn't be a stable reaction.  As far as my layman's understanding of stellar nucleosynthesis tells me (what an odd sentence), adding more mass to the core might make the supernova more energetic, and might push the star past the tipping point to become a black hole afterwards, but it doesn't seem like it would delay the supernova, much less stop it indefinitely."

If the core temperature Drops the outer layers (up to the hydrogen shell) will drop onto the core because the gravitational pull is now stronger then the outwards pushing radiation energy. This process will heavily drive the fusion rate of all the remaining elements up (start of a supernova). In this environment of extreme temperatures and pressures, elements heavier than iron will be created.

The outer shell of Betelgeuse is expanding/contracting (pulsating) at a rate of about 6 years. This is because the energy produced within the star is pushing the hyrdogen layer out. An expanded outer layer cannot hold energy back very well, so the outer layer cools down again and contracts. The more contracted the outer layer is, the better it holds energy within the star and it starts heating up/contracting again.  A star can already produce nickel or iron but at a low rate. There is no clear cutoff between the phases. Heavier elements can be produced in early stages already but it's not enough for the core to get critical."

askscience,3dda8f,Zudd,3,Wed Jul 15 18:51:47 2015 UTC,Correct. Supermassive stars (or Supergiants/Hypergiants) generate much more pressure to their core which generates tremendous heat (surface temperature of over 50000K compared to the ~5800K of the sun). They burn hotter and propagate quicker through the different burning processes so they reach their critical state quicker than less massive stars.

This process happened so fast that even very short-lived isotopes wouldn't have time to decay before being transmuted to more and more massive elements.  For example, the heaviest abundant isotope in the supernova debris would initially be Nickel-56, and this would be transmuted into Gold-197 through the addition of over 140 neutrons (some of which would decay to Protons).

There is a way you can actually escape radio waves, but not by outrunning it. When you travel at hypersonic speeds in air (speed > mach 4 or 5), you ionize the air around you because, the temperatures get high enough (due to drag and compressive heating) for air (particularly nitrogen) to get ionized. This ionized air will interact with the radio waves and can effectively cut-off communication. This is also the reason why there is no communication during (for some time) the re-entry of spacecraft to the earth.

For fertile offspring, the farthest back you could maybe go would be the homo sapien - homo sapien sapien divergence of around 200000 years ago, and that's very iffy."

For example, some mule females have proven fertile despite horses and donkeys splitting around I believe somewhere around 700k-1.5mil years ago. False killer whales and bottlenose dolphins yield viable offspring despite being of different genus and species. Making a conservative assumption, and based on the little evolution comparatively in the mechanism of human reproduction/fertilization, homo heidelbergensis would be the most likely candidate."

These have been commonly used for decades, especially for missions where spacecraft travel far from the sun where solar power isn't feasible. The New Horizons spacecraft currently in the news uses RTGs, as do the very distant Voyager probes. As for fission-based nuclear power, they have been used and there is continuing interest, but there are cost and safety issues with the development. If you're close enough to the sun that you can use solar power, you might as well. It's safer in that a catastrophic launch failure won't scatter radioactive material all over, and it doesn't have the exponential decay of power generation that an RTG has."

askscience,3dfir7,DCarrier,4,Thu Jul 16 06:33:39 2015 UTC,"The three components of nuclear EMP, as defined by the IEC, are called ""E1"", ""E2"" and ""E3"".  E1 is produced when gamma radiation from the nuclear detonation ionizes (strips electrons from) atoms in the upper atmosphere.   It apparently does a lot of this very quickly, <1000 nanoseconds.   The E2 component is generated by scattered gamma rays and inelastic gammas produced by neutrons.   Presumably, E2 generates the pulse in the same way as 1, by knocking electrons off the atmospheric atoms, though over a much longer period, similar to a lightning strike.   The E3 component is very different from E1 and E2. E3 is a very slow pulse, lasting tens to hundreds of seconds. It is caused by the nuclear detonation's temporary distortion of the Earth's magnetic field.   Yup, looks like the atmosphere does play a role in EMP from nukes. However I suspect that even in vacuum, it could have a similar ionising effect against a ship hull, though perhaps to a different extent.   The damaging effects on orbiting satellites are usually due to factors other than EMP. In the Starfish Prime nuclear test, most damage was to the satellites' solar panels while passing through radiation belts created by the explosion."

By having a hot nuclear pile and using it to boil and then superheat liquid hydrogen, you could reach temperatures and thrust levels that chemical rockets could only dream about.  There is also a design known as the Gas Core Nuclear Rocket, or nuclear light bulb.  The nuclear reaction  is contained behind a wall of fused silica, which is transparent to UV.  The hydrogen would flow past this window, and absorb the UV, reaching extremely high temperatures.

askscience,3dfir7,GrimSkey,5,Thu Jul 16 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"That's actually my area of research! If you just want a cool pic here is a link to a post I made on /r/space a month ago.  There are several different technologies for ion thrusters but the basic principle is always the same. The idea is that you take a gaz (Xenon most of the time) and you turn it into a plasma. A plasma is a state of matter where the some of the electrons manage to leave the atoms and kind of float around on there own. That means that you get a ""soup"" of negatively charged electrons and positively charged atoms (called ions).  The cool thing with electrically charged particle is that you can push them around with electric fields and control where they go with magnetic fields. I won't go into the details here but basically you can accelerate the ions to ridiculous speeds. The gas at the back of an ordinary rocket engine is typically going at around 3000m/s (6700mph) whereas for ion thrusters you can easily reach 15000m/s (33500mph)!! Since the efficiency (the ""mpg"") of a rocket is directly dependent on how fast the exhaust is going, ion drives are insanely fuel efficient.  The main issue is that accelerating ions to such high speeds with electricity requires a lot of power that we don't currently have on spacecrafts. This is the reason why ion drives have such low thrust. It's not necessarily a big issue since in space there is nothing to slow you down so you can just fire the thruster for days at a time. However if you are somewhat in a hurry (you want to get to Mars in less than 6 month for example) we will need additional source of power like nuclear fission reactors.  I have tried to keep it relatively simple but don't hesitate to ask questions if you want to know more."
askscience,3dfir7,electric_ionland,2,Thu Jul 16 06:48:40 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool! Nothing has amazed me more than science. The fact that I'm talking to someone who deals with this on a daily basis is pretty awesome. I always dreamed of being a physicist. I would love that opportunity. On your post you said you used gaz. What is Gaz? I'm assuming it's a gas. How does gaz turn into plasma? Is it like a turbine engine where the fuel mixes with air to produce thrust? Are Xenon gas quantities limited? Is it difficult to control the plasma or is it just a matter of increasing the magnetic fields? Are there any risks in ion drives and is maintenance on one difficult? I know its a bunch of questions its just that things like this interest me than anything.
askscience,3dfir7,GrimSkey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:19:31 2015 UTC,"Gaz is the effing mistake I make every single time I write in English and I don't pay attention... it's supposed to be gas.   How does gas turn into plasma?    Turning the gas into plasma is done in a variety of ways. Gridded thrusters often send high frequency radio wave into a chamber where the gas is injected at low pressure. It either acts as a microwave and heats up the gas until it turns into a plasma, or it just acts on the electrons to strip them from the atoms. For Hall effect thrusters (the one I work on) it's more complicated. You have to send a strong current through the gas to ionize it. The fast electrons in the electric current can knock other electrons away from neutral atoms. But there are a lot of details we don't quite understand.   Is it like a turbine engine where the fuel mixes with air to produce thrust?   Not really, you don't have any chemistry happening, it's all physics. The xenon doesn't react with anything.    Are Xenon gas quantities limited?   It's pretty hard to get out of the air so it's expensive and satellite operators would like to replace it with the cheaper Argon. However to my knowledge there is no real risk of running out. Moreover Xenon is good because it's heavy (which increase the thurst) and is easy to ionize.   Is it difficult to control the plasma or is it just a matter of increasing the magnetic fields?   It's not straightforward but we are starting to have a good idea of how it works. The issue we have with Hall thrusters is that some fast ions collide with the thruster walls and slowly wear them. Some American labs have found ways to limit that but it's fairly new discovery. That's what I am starting to work on.   Are there any risks in ion drives and is maintenance on one difficult?    There is no real risks apart from the usual high pressure tanks and fairly high power electric systems. Ion drives also tends to spray the ions a bit all over the place and it can be bad for solar panels and scientific instruments if you are not careful. So far we haven't done much maintenance since they have only flown on unmanned satellites. However changing the ceramic walls and maybe the neutralizing cathode once in a while could really increase the lifespan of a thruster."

askscience,3dfir7,TbonerT,4,Thu Jul 16 13:22:46 2015 UTC,You're confused about the difference between energy and thrust.   Rockets work by burning fuel to produce an exhaust that provides thrust. You can run a nuclear reactor for decades with a tiny amount of nuclear material to produce electricity -- and NASA have been doing precisely this since the Pioneer and Voyager missions -- but this will not provide any thrust without a reaction mass to eject.   That's what the big tanks on rockets are for. It's a completely different requirement to the one nuclear reactors are designed to solve.

But in its rest frame its the rest of the universe that is moving, but to move the whole universe you'd need a lot more kinetic energy so.. how does this work out with conservation of energy and all that?"
askscience,3dgcvn,Aliudnomen,5,Thu Jul 16 10:54:30 2015 UTC,"Kinetic energy is dependent on your reference frame. Let's look at an asteroid zooming towards earth for a head-on collision. The asteroid is moving at speed v, and has mass m. It has momentum and kinetic energy   pa = mv  Ka = 1/2 mv2 = pa2/(2m)   In the frame of earth. Earth, meanwhile, has velocity -v in the frame of the asteroid and mass M:   pe = -Mv  Ke = 1/2 Mv2 = pe2/(2M)   Since M>>m, earth has much more momentum and KE. Now, let's look at the collision from the frame of earth. Here, the asteroid collides with the earth, and the earth gains its momentum and its mass. Therefore, the earth now moves in the direction of v, with a velocity u determined by the conservation of momentum:   pafter = pbefore = mv  (M+m)u = mv  u = mv/(M+m)   So the new system now has kinetic energy   Kafter = 1/2 (M+m)u2 = 1/2 (M+m)*m2v2/(M+m)2 = pa2/(2M+2m)   This is much less than the energy before the collision; the rest of the energy is lost to heat, sound etc. This energy is important, because it's independent of refence frame. Let's call this energy Ea; it has the value   Ea = Kafter - Ka = pa2(1/(2M+2m) - 1/(2m))   Now let's look at the collision from the asteroid frame. Here, the earth collides with the asteroid, which slows the earth by an amount again determined by momentum conservation, so at the end of the collision earth has velocity w:   pafter = pbefore = -Mv  (M+m)w = -Mv  w = -Mv/(M+m)   Kinetic energy of the new system is given by   Kafter = 1/2 (M+m)w2 = 1/2 (M+m)*M2v2/(M+m)2 = pe2/(2M+2m)   The energy difference is now   Eb = Kafter - Ke = pe2*(1/(2M+2m)-1/(2M))   For energy to be conserved, it must be true that Ea = Eb. Let's prove that.  First, let's write out the expression for Ea explicitly in terms of M, m, and v:   Ea = m2v2/(2M+2m) - m2v2/(2m) = m2v2/(2M+2m) - mv2/2 = v2(m2/(2M+2m)-m/2) = v2(m2/(2M+2m)-(Mm+m2)/(2M+2m))  Ea = -Mm/(2M+2m)v2   Similarly, for Eb:   Eb = M2v2/(2M+2m) - M2v2/(2M) = M2v2/(2M+2m) - Mv2/2 = v2(M2/(2M+2m)-M/2) = v2(M2/(2M+2m)-(Mm+M2)/(2M+2m))  Eb = -Mm/(2M+2m)v2   Done! Ea = Eb, so energy is conserved between reference frames in the collision!  TL;DR Energy itself isn't important or always conserved between frames, differences in energy are important and conserved."

I can understand the math in itself, but I'm not enough of a mathematician that just looking at math can give me any kind of intuitive understanding other than ""yeah ok, the math checks out"".  I guess the one thing I picked up is that the velocity of the rest of the universe doesn't really matter, only the part of the universe you eventually collide with? That somehow feels like ""cheating"" though. As in, when you apply X kinetic energy to an object, this should (according to my understanding of relativity, let me know if this is wrong) be 100% equal in every way to applying -X kinetic energy to every other object in the universe, even if you never happen to collide with them.

When you go transform between reference frames, you transform velocities. The kinetic energy associated with any object changes accordingly.   The thing is, the kinetic energy of an object isn't what's interesting. What's interesting is what happens when this object collides or something like that. And in that case, as I showed in my other post, conservation of momentum conspires to keep everything consistent between reference frames.  Think about it - what does kinetic energy really mean?

And it turns out that if your velocity and acceleration are parallel, you get F = y3ma, and if the acceleration is perpendicular to the acceleration, you get F = yma, where y is the Lorentz factor.  For any case in between perpendicular and parallel, you get F = yma + a term that depends on the dot product of a and v."
askscience,3dgcvn,DCarrier,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:31 2015 UTC,"No. Gravity is more complicated than Newton believed. It depends on momentum as well as energy density, so something with that much momentum won't for a black hole. From its own reference frame it's not a black hole, and all reference frames must predict the same outcome."
askscience,3dgj12,TheRealFalconFlurry,3,Thu Jul 16 02:24:51 2015 UTC,"Jump. Measure how high you jump in meters. Call this height ""h"". sqroot(2*h*9.81) should be your initial velocity. We want this to be equal to escape velocity, which is sqroot(2gr), where g is the surface gravity and r is the radius of the object. Simplify everything, and you get g=9.81(h/r)"
askscience,3dgj12,loki130,2,Thu Jul 16 07:43:46 2015 UTC,You need to put \s before your *s. You wrote  2*h*9.81   which gave you 2h9.81. You should have written  2\*h\*9.81   which would give you 2*h*9.81.
askscience,3dgj12,DCarrier,2,Thu Jul 16 07:58:12 2015 UTC,"You have to be careful to measure the maximum vertical change in your center of gravity during the jump. So basically, keep your arms and legs still once you leave the ground and measure the maximum distance from your feet to the ground."
askscience,3dgj12,sluuuurp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"That gives 3 m/s for a 0.5 m jump. Meteorites have a density of about 3 t/m3. Then, it's easy to assume a radius and calculate the escape velocity in Wolfram Alpha by: ""escape velocity of 2300 m and (3*(4/3)*pi*2300^3) tonne"". So our little planet would be of 2.3 km radius. Adjust height and density to get different results."
askscience,3dgj12,RRautamaa,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:46 2015 UTC,The equation for escape velocity is sqrt(2GM/r). The equation for surface gravity is GM/r2. So escape velocity is sqrt(2gr).
askscience,3dgj12,DCarrier,2,Thu Jul 16 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"As others here wrote, the escape velocity is what's most interesting. However, jumping is not the best way to escape from a planet. You can reach far higher speeds running, so the best way to escape the gravitational field of a planet is to run very fast, not to jump"
askscience,3dgj12,Rzztmass,2,Thu Jul 16 08:01:08 2015 UTC,"Well, have you tried running on a planetoid that has so little gravity that you could reach escape velocity by jumping ? I'd imagine that's rather tricky."
askscience,3dgj12,Nagransham,2,Thu Jul 16 09:16:03 2015 UTC,"Good point. Let's not call it running then, but rather hopping forward. Using your muscles to add forward velocity with every bound will make you reach higher forward velocities than you could ever hope to reach vertically. Makes it possible to escape a body with higher gravity than if you tried only jumping up."
askscience,3dgj12,Rzztmass,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"Escape velocity is given by v = sqrt(2Gm/r) where G is the universal gravitational constant.  A human can jump at about 2.5 m/s so use that as v.  Then you can decide on a planet size and calculate mass, or decide on a mass and then calculate the size, for which a jump would allow you to escape.    For example, a planet with the same radius as earth would need to be about 3x1017 kg (about 20 million times lighter than it actually is) for this to be possible, while a planet with a smaller radius would need to even lighter for the same thing to happen."
askscience,3dgj12,stevegcook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:06:38 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't we be using force as our constant in determining jumping height, instead of velocity? If a human can jump at 2.5m/s on earth, I would imagine their jumping speed would be greater on a planet with less gravity. But we could use F=ma to determine  the amount of force exerted by the person when jumping, then use that same value in a reduced gravity situation to determine how high/fast they can jump on the smaller planet, then we could use that to determine the escape velocity and the gravity of the planet -I would think"
askscience,3dih9d,nanananBananana,6,Thu Jul 16 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"No. I never thought I'd see the day where I referenced The Core in an answer in a serious way, but they did get one thing right when the geologist responds exasperatedly to a similar query regarding how it is possible that we've explored space but can't reach the core of our planet nothing that, ""Space is easy."" This is not meant to denigrate the amazing achievements of planetary explorations, but exploring the inside of our planet (or any planet for that matter) is infinitely more challenging. The two competing factors are heat and pressure. So far, when we have tried to drill extremely deep holes, temperature is the defeating process, where the drilling apparatus has become to hot when it encounters extremely hot rocks, e.g. this somewhat special case in Iceland where we accidentally drilled into a magma chamber or the example of the deepest borehole ever drilled, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, which didn't encounter magma, but the drill bit got to hot to work when it hit ~12 km deep. Eventually, even if you were able to partially surmount the temperature problems, keeping the hole open as pressure increased as you drilled further would become increasingly challenging, to put it mildly.  Also relevant these responses to a similar question earlier today, which basically highlight why, even if we could drill much deeper, it wouldn't really be worth the cost."
askscience,3dih9d,CrustalTrudger,5,Thu Jul 16 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Assuming you went straight through the center, that is 6400km of rock/magma above you with a density from 5-15 g/cm3.     (6400x105 cm)X(10 g/cm3 )= 6.4x109 g/cm2 (6.4x109 g/cm2) x (1 metric ton / 106 g) = 6.4x103 tonnes 1 g/cm² Pressure = 0.00980665 N / 0.0001 m² = 98.0665 Pa 6.4 x109 x 98 = 6.3 x1010 Pa = 63000 GPa Stongest known materials have a compressive strength of ~1000 GPa.   The hole is going to need to be at least 2 meters wide, which is about 3 square meters or 3x105 squared centimeters.    (3x105 cm2) x (6.4x103 tonnes/cm2 )=1.9x109 tonnes   The craft/device/drill would have to withstand ~2 billion tonnes of pressure. That seems difficult..."
askscience,3dih9d,WalmartCustomer,2,Thu Jul 16 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"This may be of interest to you.    TL;DR: Make a sphere of highly radioactive material (Cobalt 60) and coat it in a material with an extremely high melting point (Tungsten).  Thanks to being hotter and denser than anything else around it, this slug will sink to the center of the earth (coming back up would be problematic).  The hard part would be, of course, coming up with a useful way to get data out of this.  It would be difficult to build something that could survive being inside an extremely hot and radioactive ball, and getting data back to the surface would be a bigger challenge still."

askscience,3d8puo,liquidpig,16,Tue Jul 14 12:37:19 2015 UTC,New Horizons has an antenna that it uses to wirelessly beam the data back to earth with. Because of the distances involved it's slower than dial up though.

askscience,3d8puo,Rirere,31,Tue Jul 14 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's standard signal processing albeit in space!   By that, I mean they can leverage the same technology your router does. They just have to do it better.   Wireless comms always face considerable interference. It comes with the territory. You get around that by building error detection and correction right into the data stream. The simplest mechanism this entails is called a parity bit.   Imagine I need to send three numbers: 001.  I can add a fourth number that will tell you if something is wrong by setting a rule: There will always be an even number of ones.  0011? Good transmission! 0010?  Something went wrong!   Obviously this only protects against certain faults, but you get the idea. Some really clever folk figured out ways of hardening transmissions a while ago, and we've all benefitted si""n@=t/a"
askscience,3d8puo,13853211,13,Tue Jul 14 12:53:20 2015 UTC,"Error correcting codes. An example is the binary Golay Code. In this code, each chunk of data is sent as a 23 bit string, where up to three bits can be incorrect and still be received as intended. I could get further into the details of how this works, but on a basic level, each binary string differs from every other binary string in the 'dictionary' of accepted strings in at least 7 places. Thus even if 3 bits are flipped, the received string is still most similar to one string in the dictionary."

Along the way it may be hit by insects or birds might peck pieces off of it, but it will always reach you in some form. Once you catch it you look it over, you check it for insect or bird-pecking damage, see if there's any missing pieces, etc... You know what a ball is supposed to look like because there's certain indicators that it's a ball, round-shaped, stitched a certain way, what have you. If it's okay and made it completely, you throw it back, they catch it and because they know that they just threw this ball and only has to throw a ball once they picks up the next one and throws it. If it's damaged, you throw it away, no sense in playing with a broken ball. Your dad, mom, etc... never gets the ball thrown back and thinks, ""Well, he must not of caught it"" and throws an identical ball. This goes on and on until all of the balls have been thrown."

askscience,3d8puo,Baneken,7,Tue Jul 14 12:22:05 2015 UTC,There was mars probe in misaligment a few years back and they couldn't get a signal to it.  How they fixed it ? by catching the signal as it bounced from a near by moon to earth ... That's a good yardstick on how sensitive are those antenna arrays around the globe.
askscience,3d8puo,JockMctavishtheDog,6,Tue Jul 14 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"The probe has a directional transmitter, so over long distances the signal stays stronger; it's not like it's dissipating in every direction like your typical home wireless network. Then NASA are using the; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network  to act as a receiver for signals sent by the probe. So it's a pretty weak signal, but they have massive dishes to actually pick it up at all."

askscience,3d8puo,kennerly,29,Tue Jul 14 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"It takes a minimum of 42 minutes for a single LORRI (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) photo to transmit from the New Horison to earth.  Each communication session takes about 8 hours which means we can get about 11 photos per session.  Assuming that the Deep Space Network is available for the entire transmission.  Right now the New Horizon is scanning pluto, we got some earlier preliminary photos, but for the close up stuff NH is taking those pictures right now.    Dr. Grunsfeld (director of New Horizon) said we will be getting the data dump sometime tonight after the initial scan of pluto is complete.  Remember New Horizon only has one dish so it can either gather data or transmit data not both.  So once it collects data it will send a ""ping"" to earth to confirm that we are ready to receive the data.  Then we will confirm once we are ready and NH will send the data.  So it could be up to a week depending on the availability of the Deep Space Network.  Although I imagine we'll get the data dump started tonight."

askscience,3d8puo,Bad_Pirate,10,Tue Jul 14 13:14:56 2015 UTC,Alan Stern just said on the stream that the probe is going to be taking pictures/data throughout the day and it will send a message saying if it was successful at 9PM ET.  My guess is that we'll get to see more pictures/etc over the next few months.
askscience,3d8puo,petrichorE6,59,Tue Jul 14 13:17:10 2015 UTC,"It just went live! Here's an image of it that was shown in the stream  E: That was the last image that New Horizons(the spacecraft) took yesterday, over 3.5 billion miles away form Earth and it's taking pictures at such amazing quality too! From what I heard from the stream, more is to be expected tomorrow as the spacecraft approaches Pluto, with images 10x the quality of the one above and also 'a waterfall of data' is to be expected once a signal is established.  Interesting titbit I heard from the stream: The spacecraft is powered by RTG( Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators) which converts heat released by radioactive materials and in this case, plutonium which was coincidentally named after pluto itself! Talk about fate eh? However, as plutonium decays, the amount of energy that can be generated will decrease as time passes. It is said that if the spacecraft remains healthy, the craft can survive up to 15-20 years. And by that time, it would have travelled 100 astronomical unit, or a whopping 14 959 787 070 kilometers from our sun! All while it's transmitting data back to us."

The craft had a communication rate of 38 kbit/s at Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately 1 kbit/s is expected. Besides the low bandwidth, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5 hours (one-way).   ...  New Horizons will record scientific instrument data to its solid-state buffer at each encounter, then transmit the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders (one primary, one backup) holding up to 8 gigabytes each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is because New Horizons will require 45 to 90 days after it has left the vicinity of Pluto (or future target object) to transmit the buffer load back to Earth"

askscience,3d609p,dantheman757,3786,Mon Jul 13 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"To understand the Manhattan Project you have to understand the problems facing nuclear bomb production and how the project tackled them. There are two main issues in building a bomb, both with significant depth of details. One is materials, you need a fissile material suitable for use in an unmoderated fast-fission chain reaction. In the 1940s the candidates for such materials were U-235, U-233 (bred from Thorium-232), and Plutonium (primarily Pu-239). The downside of all of these is they are hard to produce, which turns out to be somewhat advantageous for the human race because it means it's not easy to make nuclear weapons. U-233 and Plutonium both require operating a nuclear reactor which serves as a prodigious source of neutrons which transmutes natural materials, that can then be chemically separated later. U-235 is naturally occurring but only in extremely low abundance as a tiny fraction of natural Uranium so isotopic separation at industrial scales is required.  The second issue is assembly, and this adds even more complexity. With highly enriched Uranium (mostly U-235) speed of assembly isn't enormously important. Assembling the critical mass at speeds similar to that of a bullet being fired works, and this is where the ""gun-type"" bomb design comes from. A sub-critical mass of U-235 is fired at another sub-critical mass, when they slam together they create a mass that is beyond critical, and in a matter of micro-seconds a multi-step fission chain reaction occurs which releases terajoules of energy. With Plutonium there is an issue known as ""pre-detonation"" which prevents the use of a gun-assembly design. Any amount of bred Plutonium will contain a family of Plutonium isotopes, including things like Pu-240 which has a very high spontaneous fission rate, resulting in a large latent population of neutrons in the fissile material. What can happen is that during assembly if there are enough neutrons around then they can prematurely kick off a fission chain reaction at a time when the assembly is only just barely critical, and not in a super-critical state. The problem here is that nuclear reactions release vastly more energy than chemical reactions, and they proceed at a much faster rate. So a just barely critical chain reaction will rapidly develop enough energy to heat up and vaporize the entire bomb, and in so doing cause the bomb's components to spread apart, which then puts the bomb into a non-critical state, halting further nuclear reactions. If this happens at the instant that the bomb achieves critical mass then perhaps only a tiny amount of the potential nuclear energy is released, just around enough to vaporize the bomb, but not the kilotons of explosive yield desired. In gun-type designs the speed of assembly is so slow that the chance of a pre-detonation ""fizzle"" becomes very high when used with Plutonium. That's why implosion assembly was developed, because it creates a super-critical mass/density much faster and due to the inertia of the implosion shockwave results in the core being in a critical state for long enough to allow for a full nuclear yield. Keep in mind that maintaining criticality in a bomb core for merely 10 additional nanoseconds can essentially double the yield, and that'll give you a sense of the forces, time scales, and margins involved.  Back to materials. In the early 1940s nobody knew how to do bulk isotopic separation and several different techniques were in contention including thermal diffusion, gaseous diffusion, centrifugation, and electromagnetic separation. Each of which would require massive, complex, expensive, and extremely high-tech industrial facilities. Obtaining highly enriched Uranium would make it possible to build bombs using a sure-fire weapon design, gun-assembly. On the other hand, in principle breeding Plutonium was much easier, it required only operating a nuclear ""pile"" or reactor and pulling out Uranium periodically for processing, the reactor wouldn't even need to produce power, it just needed to produce neutrons. However, the implosion design was very sophisticated and untested, so it was a risk to pursue, though it offered the promise of being more efficient in terms of nuclear material used.  Here's the most important thing to understand about the Manhattan Project. At this point you see a huge variety of options of nuclear materials, production methods, and bomb designs. The sensible thing to do would be to do some degree of investigation into each aspect and then pursue the most promising alternatives. That's not what the Manhattan Project did, instead they pursued every route to the bomb. Simultaneously. That's how they achieved building nuclear weapons only 8 years after the discovery of the phenomenon of nuclear fission. They pursued both implosion assembly and gun-assembly. They looked at U-233 and discovered it was too hard to produce and to make into bombs. They pursued both Plutonium production and Uranium isotopic separation. They pursued every method for enriching Uranium and it turns out that what seemed to be the most promising one initially (centrifugation) was actually not very feasible with the technology of the time (and would not be until around the 1960s or so). Ultimately enriched Uranium was produced using each of the different techniques (thermal diffusion, electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion) as separate stages in a multi-step process (after the war the US focused on gaseous diffusion).  One thing to note about the ""Little Boy"" bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, the design was never tested before its use. That's how fool-proof the design was considered to be. Although it used so much Uranium (60 kg) that it would not have been feasible to run a test regardless.  Ultimately the answer to your question is that the Manhattan Project was in a break-neck dash to produce nuclear weapons using any methods possible. And the reason why the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were different is mostly because those were the bombs that were available at the time. Additionally, there was a greater capacity to build Plutonium fueled bombs because there was far more Plutonium available (as a multiple of bomb cores) than Uranium.  Also, it's possible to use Uranium in implosion assembly designs, but because the critical masses are different the specifics of the design are different as well. The US decided not to pursue a Uranium fueled implosion design during the initial Manhattan Project (though they would later build such bombs).  Edit:  Likely more than you will ever want to know about the history of nuclear weapons programs: http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/  Edit2: meant to say kg instead of lbs."

The 30+ minute drive to the site was spent with a man giving a geologic rundown of the area and why it was chosen as the location of the reactor. Everything from the formation of the region, how it was carved through the ice ages, to it's current relative stability. And this man spoke, even after a lifetime of work in the field, with such passion on what many might be a mundane subject. Nearly all the guides taught with similar love for the history of the project.  When you go in, it's I credibly well preserved, and almost all of it is just roped off, not behind glass at all. You can reach out and touch nearly everything there is (though you shouldn't touch, and I didn't, but you can get up very close and examine it all you like). Gasmasks, tools, turbines, buttons and control systems, it's all open to you.  And it's so well preserved, as though it where still up and running, but all the people running it left for lunch and you're getting a tour. There's all this original signage, there was even an ash tray with a matchbook sitting on it from the 1940s.  And the reactor itself is awe-inspiring. It's rises like this massive obelisk, a 70 foot cube of solid graphite, fed cooling water by hundreds of huge high power pumps.

Firstly thanks for your detailed answer. It was an interesting read.   However, I know pretty much nothing about nuclear weapons, fission, etc. So, a few questions:  Why and how does uranium react with itself in such a way as to create fission? What exactly is fission and why does it create so much energy?  Nuclear bombs are often described as bombs that ""split the atom"" and it is in the splitting of the atom that all the energy is created. Is this accurate? What does it have to do with fission?   Sorry for the noob questions but your post really got me interested. Thanks it advance you mad-scientist bastard!"
askscience,3d609p,G8orClam,7,Tue Jul 14 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"Fission is when an atom's nucleus (the protons and neutrons at the center) splits, hence the ""splitting the atom"" phrase.  When this happens it releases energy (mostly in the form of heat, but also can include things like gamma rays), subatomic particles, and fission fragments.  Fission Fragments are pieces of that nucleus, and they become elements of their own, determined by how many protons are in each piece (the number of neutrons is what determines the Isotope of an element). Many of them are themselves radioactive.  What you get from this process is often probabilistic, you don't always get the same thing, there is an element of randomness to it. And each element and isotope can give you different probabilities.  Uranium-235, the kind used in Little Boy, will release 2 to 3 neutrons when it undergoes Fission. Those neutrons would then go on to induce fission in other U-235 atoms in the bomb, and so on to make the chain reaction.  The chain reaction occurs within a tiny miniscule amount of time, but it takes advantage of the ability to double (or more than double) the amount of reactions for each ""generation"". You start with one atom splitting, then next iteration has 2 splits, then 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,... and so on. 1024 is the 10th step, and you are up a factor of a thousand. 10 more steps and you are up to a Million splits in that iteration. 10 more steps gets you to a billion, then a trillion. Every 10 steps gets you three zeroes on the end of the number.  Very soon the number gets very very big. Even though one atom splitting releases a very small amount of energy, when you get a ludicrous amount of them to do it in a very small time frame (remember, all this happens in less than a second), it translates to a nuclear bomb that can destroy an entire city."

askscience,3d609p,powerful_cat_broker,7,Tue Jul 14 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"First, read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission  Effectively, fission is breaking apart the atomic nucleus (consisting of protons and neutrons) into smaller nuclei -- that is, ""fission"" and ""splitting the atom"" are the same thing. The energy that holds the nucleus together (which comes from the so-called ""weak"" nuclear force) is what's released when an atom splits, and is responsible for the huge amount of energy released.  The typical agent used for creating nuclear fission is the neutron -- if you fire a neutron at a nucleus, sometimes it'll break the nucleus apart. Uranium (and plutonium, among others) have the property that sometimes when you fire a neutron in and break apart a nucleus, besides the two smaller nuclei you also get more than one extra neutron out. These two or more extra neutrons can then go on to break apart more nuclei, leading to even more neutrons, leading to more fission, leading to ...a chain reaction, with ridiculous amounts of energy released in the process.  Interestingly, not every element releases energy via fission. The elements lighter than Iron-56 actually require you to put in extra energy to make them break apart. On the other hand, these lighter elements release energy when two nuclei are joined -- or ""fused"" -- in nuclear fusion. Fusion and fission are opposite processes, and both can be harnessed to produce incredibly destructive weapons. Fusion is the process used to create thermonuclear weapons -- hydrogen bombs."

askscience,3d609p,deadwhoresofElrond,7,Tue Jul 14 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"Uranium (and other materials) release neutrons as part of their decay process.  Think of decay as ""rotting"" and neutrons as the gasses produced by rotting.  When a neutron hits another uranium atom, it upsets that atom's balance of forces that are holding it together, and the atom breaks apart.  When it does so, it releases a bunch of neutrons (among other particles) which would then hit other uranium atoms, causing those to break, and so on.  This happens all the time naturally.  However...  Weapons-grade uranium decays faster than natural uranium, releasing more neutrons  In a weapon, there are reflectors that prevent the neutrons from escaping and force them back into the uranium mass, to collide with more atoms  The destruction of uranium atoms causes energy contained in those atoms to be released rather violently.  At a certain point, if you get enough uranium all in one spot, and use neutron reflectors to keep the neutrons bouncing around in there like a pinball game gone crazy, each atom destroyed by a wayward neutron contributes to a cascade effect where so many atoms are being blown apart at once by their neighbors that the cumulative total of energy released (not ""created"", you cannot ""create"" energy) gets to massively dangerous levels."

The military was also really, really not a fan of the idea of safety devices on nuclear weapons, due to the fact that they could be exploited by the enemy, whoever that might be, so nuclear weapons remained pretty extremely dangerous, and poorly maintained at that, until the 1970's (iirc).

The second mass was kept from actually going critical by the design of the mass (a stack of rings) and by the fact it was not surrounded by neutron reflectors (those were arranged like a ""coffee can"" around the mass in the nose).  In other words, the aft mass was slowly sizzling away when the bomb was assembled, with the neutrons escaping from the mass rather than being held in, which would have caused the whole thing to go kaboom.  In the event of a crash, if the rear mass broke free and was thrown forward, yes, it could have caused a critical event.  However as the speed of the mass would almost certainly be well below the design speed of a deliberately detonated bomb, there would almost certainly have been a ""small"" explosion which would have blown the bomb apart well before the design yield was reached.  But yes, safety concerns were one reason why you don't see gun-type bombs in the US arsenal after 1945.

However, note that it's possible to simply remove the fissile parts from the bomb during transport, making it impossible for it to accidentally go off (and this was done for the ""Little Boy"" bomb).  As for implosion-type bombs, they can be in a 100% ready to fire mode with all of their bits assembled and still be safe from accidents. Modern nuclear weapons require several implosion points to detonate simultaneously in order for there to be any appreciable nuclear reactions, if a single point where to fire it would just wreck the bomb but it wouldn't go off."
askscience,3d609p,rocketsocks,6,Tue Jul 14 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on whether or not the plane crash triggers the high explosives in the bomb.  My understanding is that you still require some precision for the gun-type weapons. They usually involve a cylindrical or spherical lump of fissile material, with a hole through the middle of it. When deliberately fired that hole is filled by another piece of fissile material that fits relatively tightly.  So unless the plane crashes in a way that compresses the bomb in a perfectly linear sort of fashion, you're not going to have the core assemble correctly and have a reduced yield or no yield at all.  Gun-type weapons often also contain a neutron source. Basically you have a lump of a material [I can't remember exactly right this minute, but I think certain lithium isotopes may be used?] that generates a neutron flux when it's shocked by the two pieces of fissile material slamming together. This significantly increases the number of fissions that occur in the nanoseconds before the core disassembles. So, again, if you don't assemble the core correctly you're going to have a reduced yield because the neutron source doesn't fire.  Time scales may be an issue aswell. I would assume a plane crash is going to run over a longer time scale than a high explosive detonation. Assembling the two pieces of fissile material too slowly would result in the core getting very hot and disassembling before it's gone fully critical, reducing the yield and resulting in a fizzle. Assembling too slowly may prevent the neutron source firing aswell.  All of this above assumes the high explosive doesn't detonate though. If the high explosives are triggered and there's no mechanical damage to the bomb that prevents the assembly [and there's no failsafe mechanism] then you're in all sorts of trouble. The core assembly of a gun-type weapon is a lot less complicated than an implosion-type weapon, as you suggest, and doesn't rely on precisely timing of multiple detonators to compress the core evenly. So in that sense a gun-type weapon only requires a single point of failure.  There are other issues with the gun-type weapon aswell. They're typically only assembling two pieces of fissile material, and typically have more fissile material in them in total, with each piece being closer to a critical amount before the assembly, compared to an implosion-type weapon which has less total fissile material in more pieces, with each piece being relatively further away from a critical mass. So there are risks associated with a gun-type weapon, for example, accidentally being lost in the ocean and not actually detonating, but potentially going critical regardless because submerging it in water moderates the neutrons that are naturally produced.  tl;dr: gun-type weapons are intrinsically less safe than implosion-type weapons, but they don't explode all willy nilly."

Over, say, 6 billion years or so you end up with about 40% as much U-238 as there was originally, due to its 4.5 billion year half-life. However, that corresponds to 8.5 half-lives of U-235, so you'll end up with around 0.27% as much U-235 as there was originally (which, when you divide by 0.4 gives you 0.7%, the abundance of U-235 today).  Which means, of course, that early on in Earth's history there was a lot more U-235 around. At around 4.5 billion years ago (the age of Earth) U-235 could have made up as much as 20% of natural Uranium, which is about the extreme lower limit of what would be possible to make a bomb with (although it would be hugely inefficient).  Of course, there wasn't life around then, let alone civilization. One interesting thing to ponder though is that on some hypothetical world that evolved technological civilization faster than our own they might have a much higher natural abundance of U-235. 700 million years ago there was twice as much natural U-235 as today, and 1400 million years ago there would have been 4x, it would have been vastly easier to build nuclear reactors using natural Uranium."

askscience,3d609p,Silpion,4,Tue Jul 14 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"""Little Boy"" bomb [...] Hiroshima [...] it used so much Uranium (60 kg)   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy   When 1 pound (0.45 kg) of uranium-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 16 kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of uranium-235, out of the 141 pounds (64 kg) in the pit.   So, it was 64 kg, not 60.  But I have a question, which was the reason I looked that up at all: The text implies that 70.5 times the amount needed for the yield of 16 KT was in the bomb. Using all of it would hence have resulted in a yield of about 1.128 megatons.  The question: With current best bomb technology, how high a percentage of that very uranium could we have turned into actual yield? Bonus: Was the effective yield of Little Boy as expected, or was there a large range of uncertainty?"
askscience,3d609p,king_of_the_universe,3,Tue Jul 14 03:29:32 2015 UTC,"That's actually been tested, sort of. The Mark 18 bomb was a ""super oralloy"" HEU implosion design, it used 60kg of Uranium and one of them was test in Ivy King with a half-megaton yield. That was in the 1950s, with more modern technology it might be possible to squeeze more yield out of that much Uranium, but it's doubtful, it very much is a race between the bomb trying to blow itself apart and maintaining a critical assembly for just a few tens of nanoseconds longer.  The predicted yield of Little Boy was 13.4 kilotons, but there was a considerable amount of uncertainty in that estimate, revealed by the fact that the detonation height of the bomb was set at a level that was optimal for 5 kilotons.

Originally, the Thin Man bomb design was the preferred design, and it would have used Plutonium.  It was a gun style bomb but they weren't sure if it would work because Plutonium tends to go boom really easily.  Spoiler alert:  it wouldn't work, so they fell back on Uranium.  Uranium will work in a gun-style device, so Little Boy was born because the gun design is very simple and they weren't sure the implosion design wouldn't work at all.

When the Manhattan project started the U.S. had basically 0 fissile material. The fastest way to get fissile material in time for two bombs was to get both plutonium 239 and uranium 235. They had different processes and were manufactured at different places. They probably also wanted some redundancy so if one material was too slow they still had the other. It took about two years to get enough fissile material using either method. One was made for little boy and the other for fat man.  Fat man was shaped like a big round ball because it used the implosion  method which is best for plutonium. Basically a sphere of explosive charges were wrapped around the plutonium to start the fission reaction.  Little boy used the ""shot gun"" method where a golf size ball of uranium was fired into a basketball size ball of uranium to start the fission reaction. Little boy looked more like a torpedo because of this.  It's not like one method was particularly better than the other. In the long run though most nuclear weapons used plutonium because you could manufacture it from uranium 238 which is about 99% of the natural uranium you find.

Hence, the bomb was more spherical.  Little Boy was a gun-type device, which brought the fissile material (uranium 235) to a critical mass (and thus detonation) by firing a slug of uranium into another piece of uranium really, really fast (essentially the bomb contained a cannon for this task).  This called for a  less rotund housing."
