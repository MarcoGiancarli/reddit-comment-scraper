marketing,3e5be5,sundried_tomatoes,4,Wed Jul 22 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, whether we like it not, we have to show an ROI for events. Otherwise the CFO (or, if you're without one, the CEO) will never let you do another event again.  One of the most important parts of event management is how you capture the leads and what you do with them afterwards. Use your swag to get them in - and require the person to be scanned. As the marketing guy (with a sales team of 5-6 people typically behind me) my job is to make sure everyone who stops for a second at our booth is scanned. Maybe 1 out of 400 will refuse.  Afterwards, far too often people will simply load them into a Mailchimp list, without having a post-event strategy, even if the person might've been interested in your product. Listen, people have become great at filtering out emails they don't want. A few unsubscribes is far better than a few missed sales, because you didn't capture the lead and follow up.  ... and if you're not using a marketing automation software, make sure you have analytics with UTM links for campaign tracking.  Edited: Some thoughts on tracking ROI - if you're not using Marketo/Eloqua/Hubspot, long term campaign tracking can still be done. UTM links will capture those coming from the initial blast, but you can use things like CRM tagging in Batchbook, Salesforce campaign tracking, or even a spreadsheet. Spend a day and setup a 'data warehouse.' It'll be invaluable in the end, and as a marketing guy with analytics, you'll look like a fucking genius."

marketing,3e5be5,cuteman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. We didn't set up mechanisms to try to track its impact. This was partially due to having other priorities. A few weeks prior a major competitor announced its pending shutdown. Had we not already paid and registered, I doubt we'd have gone.  The bigger ROIs may not have been from the attendees of the conference converting to customers.   The streams of pics we put on our Facebook and Twitter pages showed everybody we're active, having fun, and out and about Material for future promotions, such as the video of a long term JotForm fan One thing that was glossed over in the article was the pic of the laptop with the other vendors' stickers. When we tweeted it out we tagged them in it. Many in turned retweeted, mutually boosting everyone's credibility. Some had significant followings. Some venture capitalists came by to discuss investing in our company. My impression was that by paying the entrance fee to the event it shows you're making money and successful. They in turn want to get in. It felt like a company like ours was the reason they were there.   This is how it felt actually- starfish on beach story."

It took around 3 months to get to rank on Google to a point where I should've been able to see some income, but April is the peak month for the type of product I chose so I didn't make too much.  However, it's made me around $40 per month with no work for the past couple months so I'm okay with that.  I'm slowly building up my number of Amazon Affiliate sites (I currently have 6). I get around 70-100 sales per month, but the items are low priced so I'm waiting for 1 of my newer sites that has higher priced products to rank.

marketing,3e3anc,lmgs37,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, you're the marketing manager and are asking how to advertise/market/promote a new business? What am I missing here?"
marketing,3e3anc,srd_kirill,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, here are the basics, which I just responded with to another post:   Your website is the central hub of all your digital, and traditional, marketing efforts.  You will want to have a two-pronged approach, to start. Start building out a content strategy, so you can build up your SERP ranking through SEO, while at the same time getting quick wins through paid advertising (ppc, content distribution [if appropriate], display and paid social). The paid approach will allow you to quickly generate some business while you work on building organic traffic to your website. Eventually, if you're good at it, your organic traffic should surpass your paid traffic.  The goal is to create interesting content which will attract potential customers to your website, and then either convert them to leads through offers or content, or convert them into sales for ecomm.  That's a pretty general answer, but your question is one that I could probably write a whole book answering. A lot of it depends on your target audience, the competition, the type of content you have and/or are able to produce, your budget, your time, your knowledge of marketing theory and consumer behavior, etc... there's a reason people go to school for marketing.  If you have any specific questions, I would be glad to help. If you read through my comment history, you will probably find a lot of the answers you might be looking for."
marketing,3e3anc,srd_kirill,3,Tue Jul 21 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"Anytime. I would also encourage you to check out HubSpot's marketing academy, where they have a ton of good basic resources on anything from creating landing pages, to how to write good marketing content, to email marketing, etc... all written in an easy to understand format. It's all free. The reason I often recommend HubSpot's marketing techniques is because they used them on their own business and grew it from a tiny company to a publicly marketing automation powerhouse."

marketing,3e3anc,DamienJDP,5,Tue Jul 21 21:03:36 2015 UTC,"I just answered an email from a reader yesterday who asked a similar question to yours, so here was my reply:  So there are a few things you could be trying out, which I'll list below.   Register your Google My Business listing. If anyone ever searches for your niche, perhaps relating to your area, your business has a better chance of appearing. Here's a post on how to register your Google My Business listing.  Use Reddit. There are quite a few subreddits who have ""promote your business"" posts and the like each week in which you can advertise. Also, there are quite a few queries to be found on Reddit. Become part of the conversation and bring interest to your company - you can read this blog post for help with marketing on Reddit. Old fashioned flyers. I know it sounds a bit ineffective, but handing out flyers does still have an effect.   Blogging works, so take advantage and blog at least twice a week. Create a Social Media presence. Create yourself a Facebook page and Twitter profile (you already have that one). Automate your blog so that all posts are automatically shared to your social media accounts. Also get involved in the discussion, similar to how you would on Reddit. If you can show you're an expert in your field, people will want to use your services. Share and retweet helpful topics, so that people have a reason to follow you. Craigslist posting. Once a week or so repost your advertisement on Craigslist using the same written content, so you don't have to rewrite it all the time. You might not actually get business this way, but it's free and takes a few minutes to do, so you might as well try.  Tell everyone you know. I know this may sound silly, or that you're basically shoving your business in people's faces, but it actually works. People like recommending great things to other people, because it makes them feel good, so make sure that everyone knows what you do so that they might bring it up with their friends and family.    In the end, with your type of business, you'll never have a very fixed income stream until you build up your reputation and people begin referring your business - this is, unfortunately, how the service/ online sales industry works, so we have to try our best with what we've got. But if you keep up the techniques I've mentioned above, and quite simply force your company's existence to be recognized, you'll eventually get there.   P.S. This was a quick copy and paste job, so I apologise if it looks a bit rough - I'm in a bit of a hurry. Good luck, and feel free to PM me if you need anymore help!"

marketing,3e3anc,kbergstr,2,Tue Jul 21 21:32:06 2015 UTC,"The best way depends on the product/service.   I'd start by setting up some baseline metrics-- you have google analytics set up right? If not, go do that now.   I'd start by looking at traffic & conversion rate. Your conversion rate is the percentage of visits that do what you want them to do-- do they fill out a form to enter an e-mail list/ place an order-- I don't know what you're selling, so I can't tell you what to do.   If it's an ecommerce site, your goal is sales.   If it's a lead generation site, your goal is to get people to share their info.   You want to figure out what percentage of visitors do that.   Now, you want to look at traffic. Figure out how people are getting to your site. While your traffic is low, I'd focus on getting the biggest bang out of what's working. Sounds like social is your target, so stick with it. It'll take a while. Just because publishing on the web doesn't cost cash, doesn't mean doing it well is easy. It will take much longer to get the traffic than you expect.   Sales equal conversion rate * traffic* average order size, right? So if you know those three things, you can work on individual tactics to lift them. Improve usability to improve conversion rate. Generate great content to lift traffic. Build product add ons to lift average order size. This lens makes it easy to develop some tactics to build sales.   I'd also be a bit concerned that you said that offering discounts could cause you to lose money on each sale. What's your profit margin? How much do you make per unit of sale? How many units do you need to sell monthly to cover basic overhead and salaries?"
marketing,3e3anc,AnonJian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, just the kind of focus I need! I meant a drastic increase in the sale percentage would be bad, we have a very comfortable profit margin even with the current sale percentage."

marketing,3e1fle,Powis1994,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:41 2015 UTC,"This is the path I took. I moved over from computer engineering (where I was a programmer) into marketing. For the past 12 years or so, I've been doing marketing work.   Here's the first question to ask yourself- What do you mean when you say 'marketing'?    I'm sure you learned in math and physics classes, the first step in solving any problem is to define your terms. If you aren't specific and clear, it's very hard to reach a solution.   After that step, do a job search looking for marketing jobs requiring those skills. Read through the job descriptions. Take note of all the skills they have listed. This step will give you an idea of the list of skillsets that companies look for. Use that list as your jumping off point to studying and acquiring new skills.  Once you have that list, just start learning and practicing those things. There's free courses and videos and training all over the web, so start there. As  you progress, create small little projects to showcase your newly acquired skills and put them on a website or even a small blog. Use the website as a portfolio to show hiring managers.   This will take some time, but that's one path to go."
marketing,3e1fle,redriverwater,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Adtech guy here. As you may have noticed, the application of technology in marketing is exploding. There's a huge demand for engineers -- mostly software, but other types as well.   Things that will make you super-appealing include:   Software development experience, whatever the level Data visualization Stats / analysis skills Any kind of machine learning / AI background   ...and of course general critical thinking. Most of the tech-heavy jobs are in the bay area and NYC, with some additional stuff in places like Boston, LA, Chicago, etc.   If you don't have any of those hard skills, you could still be great for account management, sales engineering and other similar areas.  For entry-level roles at my last company, we looked for bright kids from good schools, regardless of the major and trained them.  I'm pretty sure we never hired anyone with a marketing degree."
marketing,3e1fle,uptime,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"I will keep for Siemens PLM Software (formerly LMS) as a marketing co-op. I work in the events side of marketing, so we plan seminars and conferences etc but we have many people on the product side of marketing who have a background in engineering. Maybe look into different software companies as marketing/sales. I know it helps to have a basic knowledge of various types on engineering."

marketing,3e1fle,eazhar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:05 2015 UTC,I made the move from Design to Marketing.  I now spend most if my time with numbers in excel so you should fit right in.  Call yourself a growth hacker and your qualifications will appear a closer fit.   But nothing beats experience so pick yourself an affiliate or drop ship product. Make a 6 month marketing plan. Execute on it and show employers how great you are.
marketing,3e1s0w,kodran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can jump like that. Facebook's advertising algorithm is not at a constant push; it can exponentially jump or decrease for no reason. When I first used Facebook Ads, I tested it with only a $20 max budget. Some days I would spend only up to $0.90, while other days I could spend almost $3. For every ad that was clicked/page liked/engagement (not to be confused with impressions), the cost would go up as Facebook considers it a successful reach."

IMHO it's a waste of money as it is black-hat marketing and should, over time, be weeded out just like the previous 50 other ideas. Stick to making good videos your audience will share/comment/like organically and also paying through the proper channels such as advertising the video on youtube/twitter/facebook/etc"

marketing,3e1476,JuujarviJero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks marketing is something you do at launch to, as one nutjob put it ""make people buy our stuff."" The dev did their part. Now it's marketing's turn.   The game must be how 1950s manufacturing-centric can you get. But it's every business. Every service. And everybody.   When people locked in their parent's basement won't start thinking about marketing any sooner than day before launch, this article -- while nice -- won't be read.   When devs who are nervous socializing with people write a game, be nervous about marketing success. When you hire people who got into code because it would keep them from having to deal with humans, the project is in peril. Whatever project it is. Game dev. Business dev. Social software dev.   The entire free thing (let's call it what it is -- setting your price at zero.) is not a mandate. It's a workaround for the real problem of human interaction. Free isn't used for marketing. Free is used instead of marketing.  Of course, Autistic Social Software is the funniest article on the internet. But don't look to those who don't see it as funny to start reading articles about marketing before launch."
marketing,3e1476,AnonJian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:20:02 2015 UTC,"Hi AnonJian, Awesome reply and Autistic Social Software is pure diamond! Love it!  We should not focus to educate people who does not want to be educated (indie devs). Lets them be offended how freemium is ruined their dream of developing games, instead we should push forward the facts and disguise them into candies that attracts businesses who are in it for a growth. Faster we educate people of what it takes to survive here, faster we get quality."
marketing,3e0gvf,meanttolive,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"I suggest you develop some detailed marketing personas. That will help you zero in on what's important to your different target audiences and craft some SEO content as bait. You'll be much better off with an inbound marketing strategy than trying to chase your prospects around to various places they happen to go online, and then trying to buy impressions or clicks on those sites. If you want more info, PM me."

When you do all that there are various means to get noticed : email , marketing , fax campaigns to big companies , social media exposure and so on .   Talking about app development there are a lot of people who are searching for an app for their bussiness . They ussualy post adds on big advertising sites .
