FreeKarma,3ddxsg,DarkSkyKnight,2,Wed Jul 15 14:52:51 2015 UTC,"Paul Erdős (Hungarian: Erdős Pál [ˈɛrdøːʃ paːl]; 26 March 1913 – 20 September 1996) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, but also known for his social practice of mathematics (more than 500 collaborators) and eccentric lifestyle (Time magazine called him The Oddball's Oddball). Erdős pursued problems in combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, classical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory.    Possessions meant little to Erdős; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life as a vagabond, traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of ""Erdős problems"" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce ""my brain is open"", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next.  His colleague Alfréd Rényi said, ""a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems"", and Erdős drank copious quantities. (This quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erdős, but Erdős himself ascribed it to Rényi.) After 1971 he also took amphetamines, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking the drug for a month. Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: ""Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper."" After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his amphetamine use.  He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary: Although an agnostic atheist, he spoke of ""The Book"", a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, ""You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book."" He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the ""Supreme Fascist"" (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, ""This one's from The Book!"". This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book.    Other idiosyncratic elements of Erdős's vocabulary include:   Children were referred to as ""epsilons"" (because in mathematics, particularly calculus, an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted by the Greek letter (ε)) Women were ""bosses"" Men were ""slaves"" People who stopped doing mathematics had ""died"" People who physically died had ""left"" Alcoholic drinks were ""poison"" Music (except classical music) was ""noise"" People who had married were ""captured"" People who had divorced were ""liberated"" To give a mathematical lecture was ""to preach"" To give an oral exam to a student was ""to torture"" him/her. He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was ""samland"" (after Uncle Sam), the Soviet Union was ""joedom"" (after Joseph Stalin), and Israel was ""isreal"".     Erdős signed his name ""Paul Erdos p g o m"". When he became 60 he added ""ld"", at 65 ""ad"", at 70 ""ld"" and at 75 ""cd"".   pgom means poor great old man ld means living dead ad means archaeological discovery the second ld means legally dead cd means counts dead."

FreeKarma,3ag9wj,rhysdog1,2,Sat Jun 20 03:11:20 2015 UTC,That's ridiculous. It's one thing to protect the identity of the person who reports from other normal users but you guys are the freakin' mods. This kind of stuff would be nipped in the bud quick if you could see the name. Wishing everybody good luck here ;-;
FreeKarma,3ag9wj,RXhwZXJpbWVudDE0,2,Sat Jun 20 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"but you guys are the freakin' mods.    That is nice of you to say but remember, Mods are just regular users who volunteer to run the subs so we can all enjoy them. We aren't perfect, we are just Redditors who work for free. Some are great people with big hearts, some are a bit more human.  I'm quite glad I don't know who the over reporter is. I might have some very unpleasant words for them. I give my time willingly but this person is stealing wasting my and other mods time. :("
FreeKarma,3ag9wj,Guy_92,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you might consider yourself just a regular user but somebody (the person who promoted you to mod) considered you to be more. A professional. Which is a double edged sword: you must hold back those unpleasant words but you also should be able to keep the peace. Knowing the report-abusing user would keep the peace. It is up to you to be professional about it, sure, but ""safeguards"" like anonymous reporting allows this behavior to slip through with no penalties.  Somebody put their trust in you. In the end, it's that person who has to answer if you ""go rogue"" with information."
