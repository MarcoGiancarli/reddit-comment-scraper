cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,Cruyff14,2,Mon Jul 20 05:55:29 2015 UTC,"My dog has always been very protective of my family, but isn't a biter. She'll growl at people who come to the house for a while, and sometimes bark, but if you pick her up and ""introduce"" her, she'll calm down and eventually just relegate herself to her spot and give dirty looks.   We love her though, officiousness and all, and she's incredibly sweet to the family. I would highly recommend a cocker spaniel as a breed choice for anyone who sees their dog as ""part of the family."" My dog has a part in family conversations frequently, due to my family saying that she talks, and I think with a less quirky breed, the personality wouldn't shine through as much."

cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,nevershagagreek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"If there is a ball being thrown, my English cocker ignores all other dogs. They approach him and he does the sideways step away (eyes locked on the ball).  Otherwise he's a moderately social fellow, never too excited. As a puppy he used to piss himself with excitement, but that went away after about a year.  Honestly, I don't think either the US or English Cocker's are all that unusual in sociability. They tend to err on the shy side, but raise em right and I think they're fine."
cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,jay76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:09:39 2015 UTC,"I have an American cocker. I got her when she was a little over a year old, from a family with abusive children (and parents who didn't know you also have to train your children...)  For a long while, she was pretty iffy with kids, but with very controlled socializing, she has gotten distinctly better. She's 10 now! As for socializing with other dogs, there are a couple she's interested in, but she mostly just politely ignores them all. I've never seen her show aggression toward another animal.  Cockers are wonderful family pets! They're typically very gentle and sweet, and constantly want to be by your side. They tend to be ""excited pee-ers"" which can take longer to train out than regular housebreaking, but is definitely possible. I would have no concerns regarding their sociability. And their floppy ears are just the cutest -- Get the dog :)"
cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,baumee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:35:28 2015 UTC,"My cocker is a huge attention whore. He seems to instinctively know whether a person he's just met is a friend of the family. The only time he barks is when a family member parks the car in the driveway and takes a long time to get back to the house (to pet him, of course), or when the mailman comes to drop off a package. The only time he growls is when other dogs violate his personal space while out on walks. Cocker spaniels are awesome"
cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,OhBeAFineGirlKissMe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:36:22 2015 UTC,"How a dog responds to stimuli is based on genetic temperament and how the dog was socialized early on.  I don't consider it normal or quirky for any cocker to be fearful when first introduced to unfamiliar people or dogs. Some individuals may be reserved in nature and that is fine, but I consider timidity in a cocker to be a fault in temperament.  My show type English Cocker is outgoing and gregarious in nature.  She loves meeting people, but is aloof and disinterested in meeting strange dogs, which I have encouraged since she was a puppy.  My working type English Cocker is very reserved, but is not at all timid when introduced to new people or situations.  There's a difference between a dog that is quietly confident and one that is timid in nature.  A genetically fearful dog will always be fearful to the core, no matter how you raise it, but that fearfulness can be managed and reduced to a certain degree through early socialization and extensive behavior modification.  A genetically fearful dog can be trained and socialized to accept new people, but if a stranger comes along doesn't meet their understanding of ""safe people"", like someone wearing a silly hat or holding an umbrella, the dog will probably revert back to responding in fear. This is why it's important that when purchasing a dog you get one from a reputable breeder that only includes dogs of sound and stable temperament in their breeding program.  From there it's your job as the owner to take the time to properly socialize the pup to various stimuli.  I'm confused that you say that the pup is not from a breeder, but that you can see the mother and grandmother.  It's important that you speak to the breeder of the puppy about their personal goals and criteria for their breeding line.  What was their aim in producing this particular litter and what qualities did the sire and dam possess that were worthy of continuing their lines?  Temperament is something that breeds pretty consistent if it is something a breeder is actively selecting for, so ask about the temperament of the dogs of their breeding stock."
cockerspaniel,3dwzn4,eddasong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"Altogether over the last 25 years, my family has been lucky to have 10 American cockers (currently between my mom, dad, sister and me we have five.  Awesome breed)  We honestly haven't really had behavior issues with any of them.  The two we had when I was a kid went nuts whenever they saw men in baseball caps, but we theorized that the breeder wasn't exactly the nicest.  My sister's current dog hates having her feet touched, but she was a rescue dog so she might not have had the best past.  I think your puppymill dog might just have had some insecurities or something.  The cockers I've met have all been really pleasant to be around.  I mean, they might be neurotic at times, but not violent.  Mine, for instance, is afraid of random things like tape dispensers, mushrooms and unfamiliar stuffed animals.  But you'd be hard-pressed to find a sweeter dog.  I find that after a certain age, some cockers mellow out and become what I like to call sentient furniture.  Great for cuddling :3"

I would make sure that you socialize him with other dogs from the start. He does get jealous if he's not getting attention sometimes, but all he does is try to come sit next to you or in your lap. He will bark when someone knocks on the door, but as soon as you let the person in his tail is wagging and he wants the person to pet him. He also isn't super interested in other dogs. When we go to the dog beach, he runs up to them for about a minute and then runs back to us. I say he's a people dog. He loves being with us more than anything."

Most cockers, even the show types, are natural retrievers.   Here's my show girl retrieving a thrown ball at 8 weeks. . Phoebe didnt get to work on her formal water retrieves until she was 8 or 9 months since the water was too cold, but she caught on quick. These days she's in the water with her dummy nearly every day."

cockerspaniel,3cwydf,Watsatron,2,Sat Jul 11 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"She loves to swim in rivers (hates baths, though). And she retrieves anything from sticks to rocks. In order to find the perfect stone, she's not afraid to submerge entirely (like a duck) and search for a stone on the river bottom. She'll then fish it up and bring it to shore and keep a whole stash of them. Rinse, repeat. :)  She also understands currants; so if you throw a stick in the water, she'll dive in upriver to get some momentum and reach the stick faster than if she would have dived in directly and have to fight the currant.  (the odd light effect on the photo is just me messing up my camera settings, but I think it turned out quite nicely)."

The differences in the heads is the easiest way to tell which strain.  Workers have flatter heads and shorter ears that sit higher on the head.  Show cockers have a doomed head and ears that start level to the eyes. Most workers tend to carry less coat,  but also depends on their breeding,  age,  and whether they've been neutered.

The eyelid would actually be partially closed because one of the muscles helping to keep it open has involuntary autonomic (sympathetic) innervation. I think this is more like what we would call Bell's palsy in humans, but in dogs I think they just call it facial paralysis (often idiopathic)."

cockerspaniel,33cvo3,thebeesbollocks,3,Tue Apr 21 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"By 6-8 months they should have reached skeletal maturity.  However, they will continue to pack on more mass in terms of muscle until 18-24 months.    All dogs are individuals, but I find that English Cockers as a breed don't calm down for quite a while, especially if they're of working type.  I have an 8 yr old worker and a 3 year old show type and both are very energetic and playful, though the worker is on a completely different level than is typical of a pet dog.    What you're describing sounds to be more of a matter of training. If you don't want your dog to run up and play with strange dogs then you have to teach him not to do so.   It's difficult to judge just based off your description, but I wouldn't blame a dog for telling off another dog that is exhibiting unwanted rude and rambunctious behavior.  It's always best to first ask another owner if it's okay for your dog to approach instead of allowing your dog to run up to some strange dog whose temperament and history you have no knowledge of."
cockerspaniel,33cvo3,eddasong,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah its a show cocker so his behaviour could definitely be worse. He's had training classes and is very obediant and responsive when its just me and the him. But add another dog in the mix and that training goes out the window. Fortunately he has developed some loyalty so after a bit of playing he will stop and look around for me and come bounding back over, so its nice that I don't have to chase after him anymore.   Also he doesn't tend to bother bigger dogs as much because they usually just stand there and don't react at all, but a lot of toy dogs that are the same size/slightly smaller than him either play with him too or are grumpy bastards and try and bite him (schnauzers are definitely the grumpiest breed I've encountered).  But yeah I think he will grow out of pissing off other dogs I just have no idea when."
cockerspaniel,33cvo3,eddasong,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"With training you have to slowly build on proofing for distance, distractions, and duration.  You could try putting him on a long line while you proof his recall and ""leave"" commands.  You have to train him to focus on you and not on other dogs.  It's nice that your dog is only trying to play, but he might eventually run into a dog that isn't interested in playing and that might violently tell your dog off.  I'm not trying to lecture, but every time your dog approaches another strange dog, he risks pissing off the wrong type of dog.  He's 7 months so I still has some of that puppy license that makes older and bigger dogs more tolerant of him and his antics, but the older he gets the more you're going to see less dogs that appreciate being rushed at."
cockerspaniel,33cvo3,LornoPorno,2,Wed Apr 22 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"My English cocker stopped getting bigger at around 9 or 10 months. From there he just got more fluffy. He is now two and is still very bouncy but he doesn't approach other dogs unless they're very nearby. He won't go stampeding across the park to say hello to every dog and person like he used to, and is good when being told to leave animals and people. However I still struggle to get his attention away from smells and if someone has a football in the park I am pretty much fucked haha."

cockerspaniel,33dn5h,tleep76,2,Tue Apr 21 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"We've had a time of it trying to get our cocker to stop biting. It is very light and only when playing and excited, never aggressively. We have to pick her up and set her on the end of the couch and essentially 'put her in timeout'. She's has to stay on that spot and can't play anymore. It helps and the biting is diminishing.   That is really breaking a behavior, though. I'm not sure how to make your pup go outside. Ours won't go out without us still at a year old."

He obviously understands that he isn't supposed to go in the house because he hides and yet he seems to go in the same spot every time which means that there is something that attracts him to going there. I wonder if it has to do something with a smell being there that isn't detectable to you because he chose that spot for a reason, I wonder if something like puppy pads would at least help to prevent any painful cleanups.  This is a really tricky situation and I am definitely no expert and I have never owned more than one Cocker or dog for that matter but I hope you find a solution that works for you and yet again give yourself a pat on the back because you are putting a lot of effort into fixing this."
cockerspaniel,2zhhe7,Ivoy,2,Wed Mar 18 20:02:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I've been afraid to post this because I know some dog owners (like some parents) have a tendency to react like you're doing everything all wrong and you shouldn't even be allowed to own a dog, etc. but at this point I could deal with the judgement if someone could actually solve the problem!  Regarding the area where he pees, it actually used to be the foyer for a long time - when he finally got that he was supposed to go outside, that's when he changed locations.  Like ""OK, I know I'm supposed to do this out there, but I can't bring myself to actually go outside so hopefully this is close enough.""  I've mopped the area with bleach, vinegar and pet-odor eliminator repeatedly but nothing has changed it.  Puppy pads might actually be an idea though.  If he gets used to going on those maybe I could move them outside eventually and see if he follows?"
cockerspaniel,2zhhe7,Ivoy,3,Wed Mar 18 20:19:37 2015 UTC,"I think that could be an idea for sure, if you place it where he pees all the time hopefully he gets used to the smell of them and uses it regularly you can then try moving it outside as you said and he might follow. I think it would be worth a shot especially because the immediate effect of him using them hopefully will help with stress levels due to having to clean it up all the time.   As far as judgement goes I understand what you are saying, some people like to think they are perfect dog owners but nobody is and every dog is different. Keep us updated if that idea works!"
cockerspaniel,2zhhe7,sammydacat,2,Wed Mar 18 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"My cocker Sadie will not go outside by herself. If I open the door she will run out, turn around and look at me to see if I am actually going out. If I close the door while she is out there she will want to come back on and then nudges me to ""come with her"". It kinda sucks, especially on cold rainy nights at 3 am, but it's either that or she will go to the bathroom in the house."
cockerspaniel,2zhhe7,ikilleddumbly,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:24:27 2015 UTC,I could live with that maybe if he would hold it while we weren't home or when we were asleep - we did that with our older dog while we lived in an apartment in Chicago and obviously didn't have a dog door.  But even if we take Hank out right before we go to bed there's always a puddle in the morning.
cockerspaniel,2zhhe7,homehealthgirl,2,Wed Mar 18 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"I fostered a cocker for a few months and we trained him to use bells attached to a string on the door. It sounds like he knows he needs to go out, but maybe hes just afraid of the doggy door?  Amazon has them but for less than half of that you can go to your local craft store like Michael's and buy a yard or two of ribbon and some bells and make it for your self!  It's a long process but the pups I've trained to use this method pick up on it quickly! You just lift their paw and tap the bells each and every time you take them out. That way they have a way to alert you that they need to go out!   He might just be scared of the doggy door, and hopefully this helps give him a way to say he needs to go!"

cockerspaniel,2wpvkv,BendyZebra,2,Sun Feb 22 02:11:29 2015 UTC,"Nice survey! I have an English Cocker and I do everything myself as I prefer a completely natural coat (I just tidy up the ends of her feathering and skirt so they don't get ratty but keep the length).   Past experience tells me that no matter how many times I explain what I want to a groomer, they always overdo it. I've never trimmed any of my pups ears (bar clearing away fur from the ear canal) and I am yet to find a groomer that will listen when I tell them not to touch their ears.   I really can't stand the look of trimmed, blunt, rounded off ears. I don't like the short, clipped look anywhere on the body but the ears especially!  Plus Blossom is very sensitive and dislikes anyone going near her back end. She won't even allow other dogs to sniff her rear so a groomer wouldn't stand a chance of getting near her.   She's fine with my husband brushing her skirt (it's done daily and she's used to him doing it) but I'm the only one that can get her to stay still and calm around scissors when it's time to tidy up the ends anywhere near her rear.  I also get the fun job of emptying her anal glands if they become blocked as she completely freaks out if anyone else attempts it.   It's less stressful for her to be groomed at home as she trusts us. She loves being brushed and gets super excited after her evening walk when the brushes come out.   It's a lot of work keeping her in a natural coat, especially as I'm disabled, but it's worth it to me as I think she's just so pretty.   I wish I could have someone like you to help out! I know you'd listen to what I wanted and be patient with my nervy little fluffball!"
cockerspaniel,2wpvkv,BendyZebra,2,Sun Feb 22 06:20:47 2015 UTC,I'm very picky about my dogs' ears as well. It's one of their main features so I want to make sure it's done properly!
cockerspaniel,2wpvkv,eddasong,2,Sun Feb 22 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Everyone has different tastes and ideas about how the ears should look which can make it hard to find someone to groom in the way you personally prefer.  I find it much easier to just do it all myself. I enjoy it anyway and consider it part of my bonding time with Blossom. Plus the fact that I'm in such close, focused contact with her every day means I spot problems immediately.  She's only ever had two very mild ear infections in her 4 years and I noticed instantly. Both times the vet was surprised we'd noticed so early as they had to look deep into the ear canal to see anything wrong. I just know how they should smell, how they should look, how warm they should feel and how much wax I expect to see when cleaning them.  I know immediately if any one of those things is even slightly off and send my husband off to the vet with her. A few days of ear drops and she was fine both times. It's an added bonus of keeping her natural and being forced to brush her daily."
cockerspaniel,2wpvkv,eddasong,1 point,Sun Feb 22 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"Your survey almost made me feel negligent.  My two haven't had a bath since last summer, a cut since November, a brush since last month, and an ear cleaning... never.  I think grooming requirements are also dependent on the breed (American or English), type (show or worker), and the individual coat.  Red cocker coats are always so sleek and are easier to manage than a liver cocker.  I didn't even know what half of the grooming tools listed were.  I only have a steel comb, straight and thinning scissors, a mars coat king, stripping blades, a groomers stone, and a boar hair bristle brush.  I've always done my own grooming even when I didn't know what I was doing. Thankfully I had my worker boy first and his coat was very easy to manage before the loss of hormones from neutering turned his coat woolly.  I'm much better now after my show girl's breeder taught me how to keep up her coat between shows.  I'll always prefer a traditional cut on my own cockers.  I just find it very beautiful and when done right it doesn't hold them back at all when they're out and about in the woods."

I will love my little guy forever and I will always miss him, but where there's pain in my heart, it will be filled with just love as time passes.

Im also a veterinary technician  and we had a 13 year old cocker come in today with a mass on his kidney and the poor thing was rapidly declining. I just wanted to crawl in the kennel with him and hold him. Its hard to watch them get old, watch them pass, and miss then when they're gone. Im sorry for your loss, and I hope you keep Austin's memory alive."

cockerspaniel,2uqkii,Poezestrepe,3,Wed Feb 4 08:37:50 2015 UTC,"Silly pup.  She's more of a snowball than a cocker spaniel.  I have a blue roan show type Cocker that resembles your girl.  How old is Îlot?  It really helps if you strip their coat and keep the leg feathering and undercarriage trim, but if she's still not ready for the puppy coat to blow you might have to just always have a warm bath ready afterwards.  For my two cockers (a show and a worker) I also like to put mushers secret wax between theirs toes and on their feathering.  They'll be out for hours in the snow and don't get much snowballing in their coats."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:10:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!  She's 1 and a half now. She goes to the groomers', and I brush/groom her myself every day between appointments. However, she's really an immense ball of fluff, and our appointment is a bit overdue :-/  Does the wax also help against other stuff getting into her fur? Snow is very rare where we live but she usually brings home half the forest if we go on a hike.   I'm a bit afraid to strip her myself, would you happen to know of any good online guides on the subject? Or have tips? I've googled around a bit, and found a few videos, but all the comments are mostly accusing the poster of animal cruelty...."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,homehealthgirl,3,Wed Feb 4 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"Hand stripping is really easy to get the hang of, especially if your dog has a thick coat! Stripping knives aren't that expensive either.   My dogs don't notice at all. If you want you can start hand stripping with out the knives and just hand pluck. It's tedious work but it's a start if you are nervous. I was just using ear powder to create friction on my fingers and plucked starting at the neck."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,homehealthgirl,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:27:35 2015 UTC,"I already brush her with a classic brush, and about once a week with a furminator. I'll give hand stripping a try, though.  Her head still looks like Tina Turner in the eighties, though.  Do you think it's realistic to arrive at this with her? Or is this just genetics and do we have a curly cocker?"
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,homehealthgirl,2,Thu Feb 5 08:41:01 2015 UTC,"That look is achieved with frequent bathing and blow drying the hair straight, probably with some product as well. You can see underneath there is still some curl left.   After I bathe/groom my dogs their ears are straight but after a couple of days or if I don't blow dry they start curling.  Are you talking about the crown too? If so that's usually hand stripped to lay flat."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"I mainly meant the crown. It really stands up, and it doesn't help she seems to like it that way. When I groom her, the first thing she does is give a good head shake to get everything to stand straight up again! :)  Also, she's rather scared of anything that makes a noise, so using a hair-dryer on her is very hard. Just getting her dry is very difficult, let alone blow drying her ""hairdresser style"". She just cowers, turns her head away and whimpers.  It's odd, since she loves being groomed in general and comes running when I tell her ""Let's go groom!"" It's not the hair dryer either, I even got a special one through our groomer - which I now use on myself since it's so good. ;)"
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,homehealthgirl,2,Thu Feb 5 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"My male's crown is curly/wavy and we found carding it helps it lay flat for at least a week or two before it pops back up.  My female's crown lays perfectly flat regardless. Alas, she also isn't a fan of the dryer. We found wrapping a towel around her ears and putting cotton balls in them helps her deal with it a lot better."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 16:14:45 2015 UTC,putting cotton balls in them   this sounds brilliant! I'm going to try that next time.
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,homehealthgirl,2,Thu Feb 5 17:04:10 2015 UTC,"As I understand it only American Cockers have crowns and that is mostly an illusion achieved through grooming.    English Cockers that fit conformation standards should have domed heads, but when grooming the head piece we strip all excess from the head and don't blend at all on the top to form a ""crown"".  At least that's how I've always thought it was.  I've never heard anyone describing the ""crown"" of an English Cocker before."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"The grooming of an American Cocker isn't just an illusion, my dogs do have domed heads the carding/grooming is more or less to make the hair lay flat against the head."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"The head of an American Cocker is more rounded than domed as stated in the breed standard, and at least in American Cockers I have seen groomed for the conformation ring, the front portion of the top of the head is groomed to have a crown of hair that is blended to to the back of the skull and the neck.    Perhaps instead of saying the term illusion I should say a grooming style to emphasize and/or compliment the rounded structure of the American Cocker head.    The English head is completely stripped of all hair and the domed appearance is one that should be evidence of pure good structure not grooming."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 23:16:03 2015 UTC,Right and she was asking about her dogs' head being smooth instead of curly. If she hand strips the head it should lay flat.
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,eddasong,2,Thu Feb 5 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"I'm only saying that the term ""crown"" isn't something used to describe the head of an English Cocker.    English Cockers don't have a crown like Americans do."
cockerspaniel,2uqkii,centurion44,2,Fri Feb 6 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"Genetics can determine the heaviness of coat, but achieving a clean chiseled finish on a head piece is achieved through grooming.    Blacks and dark blue roans generally have heavier coats and require more stripping.  Cockers with more white generally carry less coat and don't require as much constant maintenance.  Of course, there are exceptions to the rule varying by individuals and certain breeding lines, but that's usually how it works out.  Here is a picture of my girl at 7 months old before and after her very first grooming for her first conformation show.  It's mostly puppy fluff, but you can see how much was stripped to reveal the sleek and manageable adult coat. She doesn't get nearly as fluffy now, but you do have to stay on top of stripping if you want to keep your cocker neat and if you don't want them getting caught in brush while off the lead in the woods.    This is her front at 9 months old.   Here is my girl after not being groomed since early November.  The coat is curlier (being wet doesn't help) and she's got a cute top knot, but her coat doesn't hold her back at all while running in the woods."
