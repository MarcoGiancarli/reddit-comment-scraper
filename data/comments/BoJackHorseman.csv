BoJackHorseman,3e5srx,F_L_I_A,6,Wed Jul 22 04:25:48 2015 UTC,Well the jogger was talking about running. It gets easier as long as you keep at it.   To BoJack it's about trying to be a better person. It isn't easy and the hardest part is getting up everyday without backsliding but eventually as long as you keep at it being a better man won't be so hard anymore.
BoJackHorseman,3e5srx,missingpuzzle,2,Wed Jul 22 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"Dealing with the person he is, is difficult for BoJack. He said it himself when he told Mr Peanutbutter he was jealous of him. He finds happiness and self acceptance the most difficult things to address. It's an uphill struggle, much like running for the first time. 'It gets easier, but you have to do it every day.' The runner meant getting outside and running, but to BoJack and the viewer, it has a deeper meaning. BoJack's problems didn't disappear overnight, but the implication is that he's more willing to move past his failures and try again."

BoJackHorseman,3e3655,Creativeusernam3,15,Tue Jul 21 17:04:09 2015 UTC,It was just the entire intro of the show.   I think they should produce a season of Horsin' Around between seasons of BoJack.
BoJackHorseman,3e3655,CannabinoidAndroid,11,Tue Jul 21 17:10:07 2015 UTC,They actually made a full Christmas episode of Horsin' Around.  The episode is framed as Todd and Bojack watching the episode on TV but 95% of it is Horsin' Around footage.

BoJackHorseman,3e3655,27th_wonder,7,Tue Jul 21 17:42:37 2015 UTC,They do this with some of their own shows. I have seen sections that have been watched by various members of the Bluth family from Arrested Development

Californication is technically labeled as a ""drama"" as well, so you definitely get way more of an intense story out of it.  Also people say that you shouldn't watch anything past season 5 because it gets worse... but just watch the whole damn thing because you really have to stick around for the ending on it."

BoJackHorseman,3e1kqv,CannabinoidAndroid,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:23 2015 UTC,Bon Iver  Fleet Foxes
BoJackHorseman,3e1kqv,Jam2go,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm basically a walking Pitchfork dictionary, I'll fill you in on Penny's posters of animal pun bands.  Bunny Vare = Bon Iver, a band started by a bearded white dude who ran off to Wisconsin to write songs about being sad after his GF dumped him that's now one of the most-revered indie acts today. Nominated for 4 Grammys in 2011, lead singer works with Kanye a lot.  Fleet Foxes = Fleet Foxes (hey, double animal joke!), a folk group that was launched to the stratosphere when their debut album was named AOTY 2008 by Pitchfork. Released a second record in 2011, also critically acclaimed, then fell off the face of the earth (the lead singer, Robin Pecknold (hey, another animal name!) is getting his college degree at Columbia right now) but will presumably be back in a year or two. Fun fact, their former drummer is now a prominent solo indie act by the name of Father John Misty.  There's a weird irony in that Penny saw Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes on tour in 2015 because neither band has played live since 2012 (except Bon Iver just played one show this past weekend). Don't think it was intentional, just weird.  Llama Del Rey = Lana Del Rey, a singer-songwriter whose music is at once a put-on of modern hipster culture and a throwback to the drama of Americana. She's a unique beast (ha, animal joke!), doesn't really fit into any one stereotype. Her music reminds me of the 20s and 50s in tone and of lush indie pop in genre. She was infamously lambasted a few years back when she played SNL and looked like she was on heavy horse tranquilizers (hey, animal joke!).  FKA Pigs = FKA Twigs, a white-hot singer-songwriter who's known for alien, dominating and intricate beats and a wonderful falsetto. She's an indie darling right now and while I'm not a huge fan, there's a ton of talent there and she deserves it."

Seriously thanks for the run-down of those bands.   From the poster I had thought Llama Del Ray was some fashion brand/franchise. Definitely want to give it a listen. Is there any particular album you suggest I start with?"
BoJackHorseman,3e1kqv,CannabinoidAndroid,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"You're lucky because all of these bands are new enough they don't have extensive discographies.  Bon Iver has ""For Emma, Forever Ago,"" widely regarded as the best breakup album of the last decade, and ""Bon Iver, Bon Iver,"" which had the Grammy stuff. First one is mostly acoustic, second one has some arrangements. I'd recommend the ""Blood Bank EP"" as well.  Fleet Foxes have two records. Their self-titled is gentle folk, second one they experimented a little bit and succeeded (""Helplessness Blues"").  Lana has ""Born to Die"" which is a nice introduction to her style and ""Ultraviolence"" which develops it a little bit. I'm not a big fan so I don't know where to recommend you start. There's also ""Paradise EP"" and the songs she's done for ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Maleficent.""  FKA Twigs only has ""LP1."""

Like Todd having his crazy idea for a musical, which is hilarious and zany, but then they use it to show how Bojack can't erase all of his selfishness even for one of the only people who appreciates him in spite of it.  Wow. The smartest show on TV is not on TV and it's about a horse."

Episode 1 ends with him being the antagonist, the wedge between Bojack and Diane, but through season 2, him and diane are the closes thing to a stable happy couple in the show because she understands he can't comprehend the issues she doesn't want to go near, and he knows she's great even if he doesn't understand why."

If bad stuff is happening to them in one particular moment, they are unhappy, but as soon as that moment is over, they move on to whatever life throws at them next.  For the most part, everyone is their best friend and they just want to enjoy life to the fullest.

BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,jakdak,21,Tue Jul 21 00:26:31 2015 UTC,Tina was originally a boy. I love that they kept the same VA for the gender swap. It just fits her pubescent personality so well.
BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,nschirmer,8,Tue Jul 21 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, there really isn't much difference in personality either.  I think Fox felt it would be too off putting to have a boy creeping on girls about butts."
BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,2meterrichard,5,Tue Jul 21 11:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe not obsessed with butts specifically, but plenty of shows have awkward teenage sons whose defining trait is chasing popular, good looking girls. That's why Tina is so unique -- she's an awkward teenage girl who isn't pretty, isn't the object of lust for boys or ridicule for her family, writes cringe-worthy fan fiction, and creeps on good looking boys."
BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,rebooked,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"The original pilot episode with boy-Tina asking his parents/siblings to look at the rash on his crotch, pulling his pants forward, was definitely a lot more creepy somehow than girl-Tina doing it.  Probably because with a girl, looking straight down their pants from up above won't show you too much compared to a penis bulging out. Haha."

BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,slowhand88,6,Tue Jul 21 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know, they're very talented and popular VAs. It's like naming the actors on Friends and other roles they've been in."

BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,RedditFact-Checker,80,Mon Jul 20 21:17:02 2015 UTC,Why would they use the same voice for two different characters? That's just lazy.  Edit: A lot of people are missing the joke that Vincent and Kevin are literally the same character.
BoJackHorseman,3dyv9s,GHitchHiker,4,Mon Jul 20 22:40:41 2015 UTC,BoJack and his dad are both voiced by Will Arnett

BoJackHorseman,3e097d,27th_wonder,3,Tue Jul 21 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"I read someone's theory in another thread, and Im truly hoping that it turns out to be true. A user stated that they don't believe BoJack was doing anything with Penny, rather that Penny came in and tried to sleep with BJ again, and he turned her down again. Maybe they had a brief talk, or whatnot, when Charlotte entered and thought the worst. Im hoping the turns out to be the case and that its revealed in season 3. I need this to be the case."
BoJackHorseman,3e097d,MatticusVP,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"There was a comment from the writers where they said it was important that Bojack crosses the line and then comes back again. Like he actually is terrible, but not all the time.   I think they're gonna leave it at face value, but I also wish they wouldn't."
BoJackHorseman,3e097d,LouDraws,45,Wed Jul 22 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"From Charlotte's perspective, while  seeing her daughter on top of BJ, it would feel as if she had allowed a sexual predator into her home who groomed her daughter and waited for an opportunity to fuck her because of the family resemblance. Not to say anyone is completely inoccent because nobody is in this show,  but her reaction is pretty tame compared to most of the mothers I know."
BoJackHorseman,3e097d,BubblegumIPA,10,Tue Jul 21 00:43:18 2015 UTC,It's not just her daughter who is the age of consent is choosing to have sex though. She's about to sleep with a 50 something year old father figure and he's doing it because of the family resemblance.  It comes off as completely predatory and is nothing short of gut wrenching
BoJackHorseman,3e097d,BubblegumIPA,6,Tue Jul 21 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the kicker here isn't that she's 17. That just adds some extra shock value to the situation. The betrayal of trust was massive, and it makes it worse that you know it's not what Bojack really wants deep down. Getting close to Penny was just his way of experiencing something he would never actually have with Charlotte, and the absurd risk he was taking wasn't enough to stop him.  In fact, the risk of destroying his friendship with Charlotte was what made it inevitable. That's what Bojack does."
BoJackHorseman,3e097d,hrbuchanan,3,Tue Jul 21 04:23:55 2015 UTC,"The writers did a great job of making it take place in a state where 17 is the legal age of consent. Lots of viewers would feel an 18 year old would be capable of making that decision,  where 17 seems so muh more morally questionable"

BoJackHorseman,3e0xsz,MeetmeatNavarre,5,Tue Jul 21 02:51:42 2015 UTC,"Sarah Lynn Born - 1984 doesn't make sense, there's part of the montage of her fucked up life in Season 1 that mentions her turning 30, but I don't think that was completely current, it would make her only 3 when the show started. Also, by the time Herb is kicked off the show (season 4 if I remember) and Joelle calls Herb, Sarah Lynn is clearly in puberty, meaning she was 12-14. Sarah Lynn was born around 1979-1981. This would also affect the Prickly Muffin point.  Horsin Around Begins - This is 1987, just check the faux Netflix listing for the show that just has the opening theme (complete with VHS tracking!) it's listed as 1987. This would obviously affect all other Horsin' Around specific points."
BoJackHorseman,3e0xsz,MeetmeatNavarre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"Here is why I don't think the Sarah Lynn thing is off. Girls do hit puberty earlier than boys and Sarah Lynn would be 12 at the time of Herb calling, which is reasonable. The call happened in 1996, referenced by Shaquille O'Seal signing with the Lakers and Joelle going to Lilith Fair. Also I have no reason to believe that the implied immediacy of Sarah Lynn turning 30 during S1Ep3 is wrong."
BoJackHorseman,3e0xsz,IThinkImJustHappy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:03 2015 UTC,"You're right forgot about them dating the Joelle call to Herb...which is odd when I think about it being so conspicuous.  Anyway, maybe it is right, I meant, 3 years old in season 1? The only precedence I can think of for that is the Olsen twins on Full House, which ran from '87-'95. Which gives one pause when thinking about Bob Saget and BoJack. Sarah Lynn could be 12, I suppose, but 13-14 makes so much more sense, perhaps even older. I don't have anything to back it up, but Sarah Lynn being born in the '79-'82 range makes a lot more sense to me."

Anyway, at the end of S1E4 Wayne give a speech about how PB is wrong for Diane, how he's such a Zelda and she's such a Zoe, and that she's trying to cover that up but at some point the darkness inside of her is going to come out.  I think with S2E7 we finally see Diane drop that mask and see that darkness"
BoJackHorseman,3dzj9q,Mr_Peyton,40,Mon Jul 20 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"That's a good catch, they probably forgot about that joke. On the other hand The Beetles could be a Beatles coverband :)"
BoJackHorseman,3dzj9q,darthjax,20,Mon Jul 20 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesnt state explicitly that Paul McCartney was in The Beetles. Maybe The Beetles were a Beatles cover band, or another band entirely that played during the Beatles era, and had an equal amount of success?"
BoJackHorseman,3dzj9q,MatticusVP,15,Mon Jul 20 22:25:06 2015 UTC,He's a replacement for the original Paul who died. Everyone loved the Beatles so much they didn't notice/care.

BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,MeetmeatNavarre,21,Tue Jul 21 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't really that much worse than the worst he did in Season 1:   Slept with a woman who he'd known since she was in grade school. Sabotaged his best friend's magnum opus because he needed to have Todd around as a failure to make himself feel better. Tried to destroy Diane's wedding to Mr. Peanutbutter Fell in ""love"" with Diane, largely because her job forced her to see all of his ugliest traits, and still talk to him. Threw Princess Carolyn out of a moving car   He's gone after younger women before; if he's willing to go after an 18 year old while in his 50's (and he is), and we're willing to accept that (at the very least, legally speaking), then sleeping with a 17 year old isn't that much of a stretch.  Now the creepy thing, of course, is that he had been (intentionally or not) grooming her for two months, acting as a surrogate uncle, nearly killed her best friend with alcohol poisoning, and was probably about to sleep with her because her mom said no. He's shit. And he knows it. That's why the end of Season 1 was so heart-breaking; he knows that he isn't a good person, that he doesn't even understand how to be a good person, but he wants it so bad that he was begging Diane to lie to him.  And if Diane was a nicer person, she probably would have."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,ceskay0,2,Tue Jul 21 03:59:50 2015 UTC,Threw Princess Carolyn out of a moving car   Holy crap!  I'd forgotten about that!  And he knocked over a stroller with a baby in it just to avoid talking about his relationship.
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,bttfbiff,2,Tue Jul 21 23:00:39 2015 UTC,"A good portion of the comedy on the show stems from how awful a person Bojack is/can be. Then you see flashbacks to his parents, and you understand.  You never condone, maybe some of you can't forgive, but surely you must understand, after seeing the sort of people his mother and father were."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,ceskay0,2,Tue Jul 21 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"Slept With Sarah Lynn - In concept as bad, but not in practice, she's already a fucked up person who is going to snort and drink herself to death before 50. There's no real moral shortcoming there, just a lack of real concern for her and another temporary bridge of something resembling happiness.  Sabotaged Todd - Terrible as it is, he's just holding Todd back for his own selfish reasons, not ruining his life...he does that slowly and methodically with the poor treatment and emotional abuse he does to him to make himself feel better.  Nothing he's done comes even close to what he would have done to Penny, Charlotte and their family. They were happy, normal and fucked up in all the manageable and ultimately bonding ways that good families are. He fed off that and got to play the roll of the goofy neighbor in the new sitcom for a couple months. He could have continued living that life, it wouldn't have really been what he wanted and he never would have the deep connection he has with Todd, Caroline and for a time Wanda. It's the reason he never really stopped being himself, that same broken, venomous asshole. Only this time he could have done permanent emotional damage to Penny and potentially broken apart Charlotte's family all for some momentary relief and just a glimpse of that idyllic life he hallucinated in Season 1.   I can never see BoJack as sympathetic ever again, if he wants to be ok and be happy, he has to change, he has to become the pony...person? Whatever...he really wants to and knows he can be. What he is now is just not forgivable."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,waterboi216,6,Tue Jul 21 05:59:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can compare it to is the Breaking Bad episode, Ozymandias and even with that I think this episode kicks us more because while BB was a drama, BoJack is a comedy. A dark comedy, but a comedy. In both cases, the climax is a turning point because it shows just how destructive and selfish the main character is. It also is the first time they violate the truly innocent.   It's not that BoJack hasn't done bad things to other characters, it's that he was willing to do long term and psychological damage to people who have done nothing but help him due to their innate goodness. We all wanted BoJack to find his happiness with Charlotte, but then we saw that she had found her own happiness and was kind enough to share it with him. The rest of her family accepted him into their lives and asked for nothing from him. Unlike Todd, or PC or even Mr.Peanut Butter who we all see as better than BoJack but still complicate in their unhappiness. They still live in LA and feed into their shortcomings. But Kyle and the Kids were untouched in that darkness. BoJack using their kindness for nothing more than temporary relief is what disturbs us. We don't put it past him to use other people, but when he takes it to the next level and almost (literally) takes the innocence away from Penny, who thinks she's giving consent but can't because it's her 17yrs of life vs BoJacks 50, it's unforgivable.   Also I think this episode is the show reflecting the BoJack audience their own Hank After Dark awakening. What BoJack was willing to do at the expense of a young woman and his oldest friend is seriously disturbed but we had grown accustomed to forgiving him. We didn't want to believe he was capable because he makes us laugh and we want to believe in his growth. It is because we love him that we ignore all the other destructive behavior. However, we can't ignore this. This episode showed us just how deep that destruction is, and we will continue our journey with him but things will never be the same."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,abbotleather,4,Tue Jul 21 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, I want to say that I love this show. I find it amazing how deep the characters and story are, and more amazing than that, how strongly people are affected by it.  To OP: I also marathon watched season 2 twice in two days, and frankly, it made me feel shitty. Like, physically ill, and unpleasant. I drank a lot in response.  Our opinions are conflicted when it comes to whether or not Bojack was taking advantage of Charlotte's daughter, though. I don't think he is irredeemable."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,observer010,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:17 2015 UTC,"I've watched it twice (why??) as well and am still ""recovering"" as you are. All the talk about never being truly happy hits far too close to home. I can't believe I've been affected this much by an animated TV show."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,abbotleather,4,Tue Jul 21 19:25:21 2015 UTC,There's nothing else like it. Never has been.
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,Dchesebro1,4,Tue Jul 21 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"That fucking scene was so hard to watch, for so many reasons... But I wouldn't say the ""most shocking character development EVER"". Like there are so many characters out there doing bad stuff... Street Car Named Desire, anyone? Don Draper from Mad Men? Aaron Paul's own Breaking Bad? Take your pick out of pretty much ANY character from Game of Thrones, they're pretty terrible..."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,Alseid,5,Tue Jul 21 09:40:39 2015 UTC,"Mark my words, in season 3 we'll find Bojack rejected Penny a third time.  She comes in, tries to force herself on Bojack, in the struggle they break the lamp. They talk, Bojack explains her why it's a bad idea and that he doesn't want to further hurt her family, and she says ""you're a good person, Bojack"" while she fixes his bowtie.  Then Charlotte comes in, gives them no time to explain, and even though he tried to do the right thing for once in his life, Bojack eats shit.  Charlotte or Penny will go see him at some point to apologize, and further complicate whatever mess Bojack is at the time.  Mark my words."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,PeterReynoldsVA,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:53 2015 UTC,"Eeeyup - that's what I've come to think as well.  Most folks are jumping on BoJack because that's what the writers kind of intended.  At first viewing you're just faceplaming ""NO BoJack, NO!"" because it's kind of what people expect he would do.  But upon further reflection I think it was not what it looked like, was just made to look like it.  We've not seen the last of Charlotte, and perhaps Penny."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,CVance1,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:17 2015 UTC,Even on first viewing it really looked to me like she was just adjusting his bowtie.

BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,enrique15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I just don't see that being the case.   BoJack wanted the 'out' of it being Penny's choice, so he left the door literally and metaphorically open (because everything is a metaphor). She came in and not a word was spoken and in her nervous clumsiness she knocked over a lamp.  Charlotte, having noticed the balloon had come to the front lawn to retrieve it, perhaps becoming conflicted again about BoJack and what to do with him, until she heard what sounded like Penny's voice from the boat.  I don't think there was a misunderstanding, I don't think we've seen the last of Charlotte, Kyle and the kids, but I think BoJack did what he did.  That being said, even if it wasn't what it looked like and he wasn't completely at fault (which he is when he allowed a 17 year old to make that decision) he would beat himself up for it and allow himself to be the bad guy to feed that thing at his core that needs to be told how awful he is and how bad is good, good is bad."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,Alseid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:43:58 2015 UTC,"The show has never needed to whitewash BoJack before, why start now?  He did something awful and I don't think there's meant to be any ambiguity to it."

Trying to leave behind Dick Withman getting others to feel sorry for him then taking advantage of them, like a bottomless vacuum always needy of more attention, more love, it's never enough and he could never give as much back."
BoJackHorseman,3e0w4d,tipsyfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:01 2015 UTC,"I see too much BoJack in myself and I don't like it.   I think that's what draws me to the show.  It's a cautionary tale.  I've dealt with anxiety/depression throughout my adult life.  I went into media, but like most people why try to get discovered, my career stagnated fairly early on and never took off far.  I'm sure now, that if it had, I would've become a real asshole like BoJack, especially with my depression.  Money tends to isolate people and they ""stagnate"" at the age they get discovered (I forget the exact quote).  Being broke forces me to empathize with other people, which removes some of the ""BoJack"" from my personality.  Had BoJack gotten a job as an accountant in Ohio, instead of doing standup in LA, I have a feeling he'd be a fairly different person."
BoJackHorseman,3dybmx,Frostgreen,8,Mon Jul 20 15:08:21 2015 UTC,This is what I love about this show. They're really good at subtlety bringing back jokes and continuity.

BoJackHorseman,3e13su,Dchesebro1,4,Tue Jul 21 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"The series will end with Bojack drowning somehow, whether it be metaphorical or literal. Every episode of the show begins with the same imagery: Bojack getting drunk at his own party and throwing himself out his second floor window into his pool where he sinks. (Of course, the shot pans out to reveal him lying on a pool raft, so, metaphorical.) And again, in ""Downer Ending"" we hear him describe a similar scenario to Sarah Lynn and Todd: ""And when I get too old too old to take care of myself, I go for one last swim. I know I can't make it back to shore. I'm too weak, too tired. So I just let water take me under."" Bojack is going to drown somehow, and whether it's him drowning to death in water like the drug trip book idea, or drowning in his own lucrative lifestyle like the opening suggests, it's going to happen /somehow/.   EDIT: In Bojack's office there's a painting of Bojack watching Bojack swimming in his pool. Possible other hint?  Also unrelated predictions: Bojack is going to (accidentally?) reveal to Mr Peanutbutter that Diane was sleeping on his couch while he thought she was in Cordovia causing a huge problem in their marriage and the New York playwrite Jill Pill is going to be a key factor in Bojack's past. I have no real evidence to support that last thing, it's just a feeling I get watching=. The entire show is told through Bojack's perspective, what's important to him. With everything else in his past, Horsin' Around and his baggage with Herb, his problems with his parents, we know all about it. But this playwrite, and the lightly hinted at ""other TV show"" are foreign entities to us as the viewers: we don't know about them, suggesting that Bojack has either forgotten (which he hasn't) or has been actively trying to forget and ignore it. And you only ignore things when they're important."
BoJackHorseman,3e13su,Dchesebro1,2,Tue Jul 21 10:07:53 2015 UTC,I agree. Bojack is a tragically broken individual. I hope the story ends with his fix I got happiness and proving we can all defeat our inner demons... But the truth is Bojack will die alone no matter how many people are around

Even worse...she said she ""think she met my SO only once"", even though he has spoken to her at least on ten different occasions in two different states.

""[Opening this orphanage] was one of the only good things I ever did and I did it by accident."" At the end of season 2, Bojack is a bad person according to the show's own philosophies. But that's okay, because if Bojack is a bad person right now because of his actions, why can't he direct his actions towards being a better person? That's why the ending with the running man is so important. ""It gets easier, but you have to do it every day."" Running up the hill is a metaphor for being good to the people around him. It's difficult, but with practice, he can curb his self destructive habits and stop doing to so much damage to all the people close to him."

BoJackHorseman,3e1jr0,atglobe,6,Tue Jul 21 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"Wanda saying ""When you're looking at someone through rose colored glasses, the red flags just look like flags."" My gf and I had one of those question our relationship talks a few days ago, and this made me realize how lucky I am to have her.  On the other side, the last 2 episodes in general really hit hard, if only because it's such an attribute to human weakness (ironic because he's a horse), and I've been there. I also love the character development. What about you?"
BoJackHorseman,3e1jr0,atglobe,2,Tue Jul 21 07:06:21 2015 UTC,"I have a past post that talks about my ex and all the crazy bullshit I had to deal with. And I've unironically used that line that Bojack says, years before the show came out.  For me, nothing will ever hit me harder than Secretariat's speech in season one. I ran track in high school, and my cousin was murdered my junior year. Prior to this, I was always joking around, chilling, enjoying practice and meets. Afterwards, I completely withdrew. I was always running alone, I burned a lot of bridges, lost a lot of friends-but I won. And the more I won, the more I pushed ppl away. I run to escape the demons.  This season...it was jus seeing Bojack's devolution. I've been dealing with a lot of very similar things (old friend thinks she wants a relationship, but bails on it; thing that you thought you loved, you lose passion for; tough parents still on you about things; breaking up with someone who's bad for you; when you finally see that no one cares) but that realization that ""holy shit, i'm an awful person and no relationship will work for me. i will never be happy bcuz i don't know how to feel happy"", that's scary."

Towards the end of Season 2, Bojack realizes the goals he has been chasing would only bring him temporary happiness. He resolves to go see Charlotte as he has built his memory of her into his nirvana. Epp 11 opens showing his fantasy is bologna but he still gives settling down and being responsible a shot. 3 months go by and prom shows he hasn't really changed and he is looking for the exit. He tries to convince Charlotte to bail with him but doesn't realize its the life she chose and spent years building that he is asking her to bail on. Ultimately this was BoJack just trying to make someone like him by trying hard, but as drug-hallucination Lucy/Diane says, ""you can't force love block-head."" Then he fucks everything up, goes home and gets drunk. Seeing his movie be the total opposite of what he wanted yet still a success reminds him that showbiz will never go the way he wants or make him happy. Finally he takes drug-hallucination Lucy/Diane's advice and does the things he can to be ""good to the people in his life.""  Now, hopefully, BoJack's finish line is to become the person he wants to be.  Edit: I accidentally  a word"

BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,MMSTINGRAY,37,Mon Jul 20 12:00:01 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that theres a stigma to western animation that it needs to be ""funny""... and the show definitely delivers on that front.  But it treats that comedy as almost a way to contrast the very adult themes. When it's adult it's very adult. ""Tell me I'm a good person. Please"".  It uses the humor to enhance the story, starting out talking about how a teenagers boner likes being talked about, and ending with ""If you ever contact my family again, I'll fucking kill you"".  This is something you very rarely see, and the fact that the important parts are handled with such respect is what makes them stick with us."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,PolloMagnifico,26,Mon Jul 20 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"I personally get the feeling that the comedy is only there for the sole reason that if it wasn't, half of the viewers would have committed suicide by now."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,JadedEconomist,11,Mon Jul 20 16:38:05 2015 UTC,The comedy makes the show more realistic. Even if your life is a depressing mess almost all of the time you can still be distracted by enjoyable moments before going back to your self loathing.
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,BubblegumIPA,9,Mon Jul 20 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"That's pretty true. I've seen a few people who watched all of season 1, some even season 2, who don't like it because of how awfully depressing this show is. If there were no jokes it'd just be full on depressing. But it doesn't do that, it draws you in with humor then slaps you and makes you cry like a 6 month old with a poopy diaper."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,VforVictorian,7,Mon Jul 20 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"Very true. There is this pre conceived notion that ""Adult Cartoons"" are supposes to be raunchy and immature. I have never seen a show take this idea and flips it on its head. I find it fitting that the most mature animated show is on a platform like Netflix. Away from the curse of FOX Animation! Bojack is finally breaking walls in himself. I hope the show gets 2-3 more seasons and I can die happy (if they have proper closure with Bojacks view on himself and other's criticisms about him). Amazing work Netflix. Bring it on home."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,temperate,6,Mon Jul 20 16:51:45 2015 UTC,I am seriously worried that this ends with ostracized bojack committing suicide.
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,PolloMagnifico,9,Mon Jul 20 16:57:08 2015 UTC,The last season of Moral Orel was the same way.

BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,Yeevee,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"Here are some (although they aren't quite as dark)  Mission Hill which was on Adult Swim for a season in the early 2000's.  It has a goofy animation style and a similar sense of humor.  One of the most awesome but underrated animations out there.  Here are a few others that you might enjoy:  Undergrads is another one from the early 2000's, and it has a lot of goofy humor but has a much more melancholy feel to it.  One of my favorite shows ever.  Unsupervised is more of a recent show than the other two, it is written by David Hornsby (always sunny) and is about a couple of latchkey kids in Florida.  I really like it and it gets really dark at times.  Chozen is another one that is newer, but cancelled.  It is about a struggling gay white rapper.  Again, it gets a little dark and isn't quite as well written as the others, but it is still funny and has a really interesting and entertaining perspective."

BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,Yeevee,6,Tue Jul 21 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"I think it isn't more popular because it's really a niche market sort of show.  It just isn't going to appeal to most people, this combination of humor/philosophy/sadness, regardless of how good it is.    Hell, there are times I wonder if it's getting too depressing for me."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,Alan43,10,Mon Jul 20 20:18:25 2015 UTC,Bojack horsemen is an animated version of Californication.  EDIT: Not that this takes away from either show because I love them both.
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,crewdat,9,Mon Jul 20 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"I liked Californication, but I actually think the writing is significantly better on Bojack. Hank is a bit of a Gary Stu, especially in the last few seasons. I get that he's a charming dude, but women are just constantly throwing themselves at him, and everyone wants to work with him or be his friend, despite him being an unreliable, self-destructive mess. The way people treat Bojack seems a lot more realistic."

BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,crewdat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:44 2015 UTC,Having watched and enjoyed both in this past week I can safely say BJ has much better writing. Californication (at least the early episodes) is like BJ and Entourage. It felt too reliant on sex.

BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,shenanigans38,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"I think Vincent Adultman is a deeper character than we initially think he is. In a way, he represents the show: he's probably 2 kids in a trenchcoat, but he pretends to be an adult, and does ""adult"" things such as...business... and gets into an adult relationship with Princess Carolyn. That's what the show is - it's a cartoon with silly jokes and animations that attempts to explore adult relationships and adult responsibilities. That's also what Bojack Horseman is, despite his hatred (jealousy?) of Vincent Adultman, his age and outer appearence is that of an adult, but ultimately he's insecure, immature, and is trying to be better at being an adult."
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,TheAssCrackBandit,4,Tue Jul 21 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"There's a scene where Bojack and Vincent  are talking. It's  a perfect quick conversation.  ""What do you have figured out that I dont?""  ""Uhhh.... adult stuff."""
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,remeard,2,Tue Jul 21 03:19:26 2015 UTC,Watch Moral Orel. Things get really dark and intense the 2nd and 3rd season.
BoJackHorseman,3dxpyz,princetuna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound weird, but trust me and give these shows a shot: Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls and Over The Garden Wall. They have a very similar thing going for the,: they are western animations that start out 'funny' and 'colorful' and end up going places through character development like dealing with grief and loss, relationships (real relationships, like how people confront each other and work together and sometimes just fall apart), all with elements of fantasy and sci-fi mixed in.   I would start with Over The Garden Wall. It's a story about a kid taking care of his younger brother getting lost in the woods, with magic and fantasy shit. It basically goes from episode one being 'huh, so this is quirky. I like the animation quality!' to 'This shit is alice in wonderland meets edgar allen poe meets slenderman. LOVING IT.' It's all got more of a creepy vibe than a scary one, but it's excellent all the same. It personally felt the most mature out of the bunch (AT and SU both invoke a lot more humor and bright colors, so might be offputting if you're not super open to the idea of watching more animated TV shows. Trust though, they are amazing)  I started Adventure Time a year or two ago and it's been an amazing ride. The show goes from 'huh, this is colorful and weird and silly, I guess I'll see where it goes' to ""Wow. They're dealing with some heavy shit right now. Finn is confronting the father that abandoned him, Jermaine is dealing with his brothers over-idolization of their father, watching Finn be shut down by PB because of their age and maturity difference. Solid."" Oh, and there's also a lich king and stuff too, which is fun!  Steven Universe seemed a little too....kiddy(?) at first, but VERY quickly shifted gears and became one of my favorite shows. It's got your typical magic and sci-fi, and deals with a kid learning to grow up and dealing with relationships. The show is VERY heavy with the relationships, and I don't mean, like, drama necessarily, just more so about growth and separation and falling in and out of love and heartbreak and all of it. It actually tends to feature the adults relationships around him rather than his own fairly often. I love it personally because his relationship with his fat hippy dad, and how they get each other and how much the dad cares for his son while still being hands off, brings me back to when I was his age growing up with my dad.  I have yet to watch Gravity Falls, so I can't comment on that one, but I always hear all four of these lumped together as being all similar in tone and maturity, so I'll be checking it out soon."

BoJackHorseman,3e08jd,yashchand,10,Mon Jul 20 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"In ""The Telescope"" Herb mentions that BoJack gets 30K an episode. If we assume that figure stays constant along 9 seasons at 24 episodes a season, BoJack made $6.48 million from Horsin' Around. It's reasonable BoJack was able to keep and invest around a quarter of that money after taxes and expenses, so he'd have $1.6 million saved by the end of the show. If BoJack invested that money in the stock market, he'd have roughly sextupled his money from the mid-90's to now, resulting $9.6 million dollars today.   It's likely BoJack didn't make money solely from Horsin' Around. Endorsement deals, revenue from his book, other possible work would probably add between $5-10 million to his net worth, depending on when they were invested in the stock market.   Overall, $10-20 million in a decent approximation for BoJack's networth, and the evidence on the show backs this guess up. His house, for example, is a 2 bedroom house that looks kinda similar to this one only with a bigger lot and a better view, probably putting it in the ~$5 million range. BoJack drives a lexus and a non-specific, older model convertible. The boat he bought is similar to [this one](www.jamesedition.com/yachts/sunseeker/manhattan_62/manhattan-62-for-sale-874942) which costs about $500k."

BoJackHorseman,3dzax1,JackByPopularDemand,8,Mon Jul 20 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"I almost wish they would have just left him out of this season. I loved how his character was handled in the first season: he seemed like the perfect metaphor for what it actually feels like to be an adult sometimes, and how much of growing up is just learning vocabulary and norms, and how, on some level, we're still the same people we were as kids. I may be reading too much into it, but I don't believe it was entirely unintentional on their part, considering how mature / insightful he is sometimes (e.g. his reaction to pet Bojack and say ""good horsey"" seems juvenile until you consider that being told he's ""good"" is the one thing Bojack consistently wants throughout the series, and Vincent is the only one who is effectively able to comfort him). He was more just a joke this season though, and I still can't imagine any way to resolve the question of whether he's actually an adult or three kids stacked on top of each other that's funnier than the ambiguity and Bojack's frustration."

Up until she dumps Rutabaga, she needs a boyfriend for validation. If you watch all his scenes from season 1, you get a great feeling about what their relationship is like. They meet at a bar. He's there because that's what adults do. PC goes up to him because she's looking for anyone at the moment. They break up because of a shallow disagreement that's based on what he thinks adult relationships are like. Then he wins her back in the classic ""Tell her you love her"" way and PC accepts even if he didn't reveal anything about himself while doing it. Until the episode where Kevin and Vincent were in the same room, I think he was just a joke and PC was just looking for love in the wrong places. The way that scene played out, long and almost painful made me wonder why is Vincent even doing this? That's when this came to me, he's just being an adult. He and PC just reflect relationships that just happen because both parties feel they need them. If he's really 3 kids or just Vincent, I don't think it matters. Raphael Bob-Waksberg said in his AMA that he's like a human Rorschach test; that people will see what they want. Based on his relationship with PC, I think seeing him as a childish adult or child trying to be an adult is equally valid"

BoJackHorseman,3dw4xy,atari_eric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:24:42 2015 UTC,I think the causality is the wrong way round. A lot of comedies have callback jokes like this but BECAUSE the netflix ones are binge watched people spot more of them.

He came out and admitted his feelings, and even though he was turned down it still felt like the right thing to do. And then your hope builds with glowstick baloon giving you a second chance. Maybe charlotte walks up and realizes she has feelings too, and comes on the boat to find bojack alone. Maybe they run off together, or bang or something. It's not great on her end, but it's win for all of us in bojacks corner.  And then she walks up and finds him being undressed by her teenage daughter. Destroying any hope of them ever being together. Any chance of them ever seeing each other, or any chance of her ever forgiving him. He does what bojack does best. Hurting the people closest to him by breaking their trust, and destroying relationships beyond repair. The writers give you a sense of hope that maybe bojack can be better than he's been. Being with charlotte wouldn't be perfect, but it'd be a start. And then they snatch it away from you. You then watch bojack drive back on his boat. No remorse or any other expression to empathize with for the audience, and it just leaves you having to accept what happened. Fucking brutal."

BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,dybuell,95,Sun Jul 19 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"To bad he ended up being a dick, I actually liked his character a lot until he started leading PC on."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,The_Big_Daddy,74,Sun Jul 19 20:00:25 2015 UTC,"What I loved about it is they never made him a nefarious, scheming asshole.  Rutabaga showed early traits of being rather selfish, like when he sniped the Jackie O. project from Princess Carolyn, but they never took a blanket route to make him blatantly evil.  A lot of foreshadowing, but he ended up just being emotionally immature - exactly how I thought he'd end up when I saw he decorated his office with fucking guitars.  He's the kind of guy that does that, but doesn't really know a damn thing about music other than ""rock stars are cool."""
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,TomBombomb,29,Sun Jul 19 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly, I thought he came off as very realistic. In fact, I think this speech shows exactly what his problem is. He doesn't see himself as attempting to lead PC on because he genuinely likes her but HE is the star and he ultimately sees her as an extra in HIS story."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,timms5000,11,Mon Jul 20 03:38:52 2015 UTC,"His final speech is the real nail in the coffin to solidify his character. Once he starts insulting her and telling her she has limited options we see his true colors. He thinks PC will stay with him so she doesn't have to be lonely, but she showed such strength and independence in the end. So happy and so proud of PC."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,nlyles1,15,Mon Jul 20 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"I also thought he'd intended to screw PC over by putting her name on everything and only her name, but then she turned that around."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,ConBrio93,10,Mon Jul 20 03:44:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought that was great.  I thought he was clearly gonna try to dupe her on the deal, but it turns out he was just really careless with her feelings.  So while I think he actually intended to partner with her, she was able to use his weakness against him."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,TomBombomb,3,Mon Jul 20 04:06:26 2015 UTC,I really thought he was going to leave PC out to dry so he could overtake her position at the agency. Let her make the big deal about quitting and then he back out at the last second
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,the_wolverine88,18,Mon Jul 20 15:09:14 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to like the character, but damn, he burned that bridge hardcore style."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,greydestruction,41,Sun Jul 19 20:15:07 2015 UTC,"Its ironic, because the series is all about how people almost never get a Hollywood ending."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,CitizenKing,38,Sun Jul 19 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"the thing is, with her birthday episode and her arc here PC is the only one I think that will actually going to get that ending."
BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,Robnroll,32,Sun Jul 19 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, if anyone has a chance its probably PC. She's the only one really learning not to be dependent on anyone else to achieve her own happiness."

BoJackHorseman,3dv4pg,Robnroll,9,Sun Jul 19 22:40:10 2015 UTC,I loved that she got her own agency. I wondered how that thing with everything in her name would turn out

There's a quote from Synecdoche, New York that goes (something like this) ""There are 6 billion people in the world and every one of them is the lead in their own story"".   We get so wrapped up in ourselves and what we've done to deserve something, or that someone was rude to you, but you don't realize somebody else may have worked harder or had better connections, somebody could have just got off the phone and found out their parent died, or that their spouse is leaving them or they're losing their job. Sure people are dicks, but we all are in some capacity throughout our day."

BoJackHorseman,3dwdbc,tkornfeld,12,Mon Jul 20 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Still, I've never seen them start out that high before! I'm hoping for a solid 95% total: very good, very deep, but perhaps too abrasive for a 97% or higher."

BoJackHorseman,3dwdbc,Batmarde,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"7 now. And idk, i guess we have similar interests."
BoJackHorseman,3dwdbc,televisionceo,10,Tue Jul 21 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently because the first season changed so drastically (which was fine by netflix, since they expected everyone to binge watch it) critics now watched the whole way through. Previously they would just watch a few episodes in and give a score.  That said, this series got very dark. Especially Ep 11."
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,aatdalt,16,Mon Jul 20 07:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's not meaningless. It's indicative. BoJack is looking for something -- anything to grab on to. Like he said to Penny, he didn't have anywhere else to go. In BoJack's (fans' too) mind, she was waiting for him. It's just that extra dose of reality that the fact of the matter is she's moved on, with BoJack not even being a smudge on the rearview mirror. She has not thought about him in 30 years (""we knew each other for 5 minutes 30 years ago"")"
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,znoby,6,Mon Jul 20 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, that kiss on the bench seemed pretty mutual. Plus, maybe Penny is going to tell her mom what really happened and she'll get it. I don't know. I just wish something would work out for Bojack."
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,CarSnob,5,Mon Jul 20 18:01:24 2015 UTC,It doesn't change the fact that Bojack still didn't stop it. If I were a parent and caught a friend with my daughter I would be incredibly upset because they are old enough to understand why that would upset me.
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,capncrunch94,3,Mon Jul 20 18:25:05 2015 UTC,"S02e11 spoiler: [spoiler](#s it doesn't matter if he was or wasn't trying to sleep with penny and he knows it. He's realized he's bad for that family and if he maintains any contact with them he is going to hurt Charlotte. Kyle is the kind of person Charlotte deserves and bojack knows it,  ultimately nothing good can come out of a relionship with that family. If it turns out that he wasn't going to sleep with penny,  Charlotte and bojack both know it won't do any good to clear the air between themselves."
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,BubblegumIPA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:48 2015 UTC,Something did. It was voiced by Lisa Kudrow and Bojack rejected it because he was too selfish to invest in a relationship once the chrome wore off
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,the_wolverine88,5,Tue Jul 21 04:19:38 2015 UTC,kinda reaffirms that the hallucinations were meaningless
BoJackHorseman,3dx5gn,cshaps,4,Mon Jul 20 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of bummed about that too.  The Maine fantasy was one of my favorite episodes and probably the only one I went back to watch by itself more than once.  It was just such a cute and warm fantasy, and now it's gone forever."

BoJackHorseman,3dug39,VilifiedPeanut,73,Sun Jul 19 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"To me that whole part of the episode was crazy intense because he turned her down once, then made out with the mom, then went back turned her down again, then the mom caught them, then she laid into bojack and threatened to call the cops on him.   The reality of how things ended with Charlotte are so depressing against the last seasons hopeful scene of Bojack living out his life in Maine with her.  As a viewer we can relate because of all the times we've played out a happy ending in our mind but reality vs expectations just never play out the same. It's why no one wants to get their hopes up when something good seems to be happening."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,agentup,33,Sun Jul 19 20:11:51 2015 UTC,The reality of how things ended with Charlotte are so depressing against the last seasons hopeful scene of Bojack living out his life in Maine with her.   They even addressed in the season how just thought of her in Maine wasn't accurate. I think that was supposed to imply his idea of being with her was flawed
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,thabe331,12,Sun Jul 19 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think Charlotte made a great point that Bojack didn't really ""know"" her.  He had been holding out on this hopeful dream of a life with Charlotte for 20+ years but when he finally made his move it was far, far too late and Charlotte had her own life.  As a result getting involved just messed things up for her."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,thefluffyburrito,46,Mon Jul 20 06:14:56 2015 UTC,I didn't even believe that the show would go there... Wow.
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,fuck_the_DEA,24,Sun Jul 19 18:29:59 2015 UTC,I kept thinking during the episode how far he's come since Prickly Muffin. Season one BoJack would have just slept with her to spite Charlotte. Then he fucking does it anyway.
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,Aquaman_Forever,18,Sun Jul 19 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think it had anything to do with spite, he's just a reckless asshole, and didn't give one fuck about what he was doing / who he was hurting as long as he got some sort of gratification.  this is my life"
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,enrique15,7,Mon Jul 20 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"Ya, bojack doesn't try to hurt people. His selfishness hurts people. Bojack is still at a point where he doesn't care about Charlotte or her family's happiness. He only cares about his own and is using them to achieve it."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,BubblegumIPA,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:56 2015 UTC,But does he even know he's doing it?  Is he literally so narcissistic that he can't even help being a selfish asshole until someone actually has to TELL him that its wrong?
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,mackay92,5,Mon Jul 20 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. He lives in a fantasy world that requires a big event for him to change,  but every time he gets there he expects it to happen naturally without effort like on TV. Bojack doesn't think he can change on his own and therefore doesn't even try"
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,BubblegumIPA,44,Mon Jul 20 14:57:05 2015 UTC,I made this last night but waited till this morning to post it. Big thanks to /u/CitizenKing and his post for the idea to make this video.

BoJackHorseman,3dug39,chikinpickle,29,Mon Jul 20 06:14:09 2015 UTC,"This was such a depressing moment. I so wanted him to have this wonderful time with Charlotte.  This show is great, but goddamn if it isn't sad."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,danielsdesk,24,Sun Jul 19 21:19:23 2015 UTC,"It illustrates something, which is really why its so sad. That the ""geographical fix"" doesn't work.  The ideas that if you move to a new place, all your problems can be left behind. We see this for the first few months everything goes swimmingly.  Then ultimately, the same Bojack resurfaces, his issues come back. He ruins all his personal relationships.  Like Charlotte said at the end, ""I think the tar pit is you"". Running away from your problems only works until they catch up with you."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,lulbob,28,Sun Jul 19 22:54:03 2015 UTC,This is fuckin' PERFECT
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,NateFalken,11,Sun Jul 19 17:07:17 2015 UTC,Did they really do anything tho?
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,NotYourLocalCop,46,Sun Jul 19 19:32:00 2015 UTC,"I think that's the point, it doesn't matter. The situation shouldn't happen regardless of what does it does not happen. I'm sure we'll find out next season that it did though"
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,NateFalken,15,Sun Jul 19 19:53:16 2015 UTC,I think nothing really did happen. They're both fully clothed. No messy hair or signs of anything.

BoJackHorseman,3dug39,ChopstickNoseWalrus,12,Sun Jul 19 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"I'm an optimist, so I hope that Bojack was telling her why they couldn't do it, and didn't bother trying to tell Charlotte what the situation was because he's just like ""I'm a bad person and I deserve this""."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,movzx,13,Mon Jul 20 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"She was unbuttoning his jacket, man!"

She's still pawing at him. In bursts mom. Bingo, bango, bongo. There's your situation that looks one way, but is another.  I don't think anything happened. I think it is a misunderstanding and Bojack is just taking his lumps because he feels he deserves it."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,i_dontunderstand,3,Mon Jul 20 05:45:55 2015 UTC,"Would Charlotte have believed him though, even if he was telling the truth?  She knows that he has a poisonous personality and that he is capable of manipulating people.  Not only that, but he had been living with them for two entire months.  He had become part of their family, for all intents and purposes.    Her emotional betrayal hits even harder when he is (allegedly) about to screw her daughter after the two of them had literally minutes before shared a moment and had a deeply emotional encounter.  I'm not sure that she was in the mood to hear his reasoning, or maybe she wasnt even capable at the moment."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,Jet20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:54 2015 UTC,he left the door open tho.
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,attemptno6,10,Tue Jul 21 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"God that scene was a huge punch in the gut. It really felt like the lowest point in the series so far. Even the ending of Season 1's bad trip had some hope. This was just depressing.  Like season 1's drug trip, I also kind of wished it ended on the penultimate episode. But I guess we needed the finale in both circumstances to set up the potential next season, plus not have the show be entirely about wallowing in sadness."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,RPGX400,28,Mon Jul 20 04:12:11 2015 UTC,Oh my fucking god this episode. I had to pause it for a good ten minutes just before she opened the door so I could mentally prepare myself for what was about to happen.

The episode was still very cringy, as I had an idea how it would go.  I think it WAS innocent.  Otherwise, it would have been more obvious.  He was probably giving her some TV dad speech about ""you'll know when you find the right man"" and Charlotte walked in during the hug."
BoJackHorseman,3dug39,i_dontunderstand,5,Mon Jul 20 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"Well she was undoing his bow tie and his hand was on her side.  Also, he didn't really deny anything.  I know everyone wants to give Bojack some credit but... he messed up."

BoJackHorseman,3dug39,mackay92,6,Mon Jul 20 06:33:25 2015 UTC,"Think about it though, it makes sense that she would want to considering how her life is devoid of really any social interaction.  1) Mother owns a store, so she probably has to work in it on the weekends. 2) The store takes a lot of time and money from the family 3) She doesnt seem to ever have had a relationship before, despite being 17 years old. 4) New Mexico doesnt exactly seem like a great place to meet guys. 5) Her friends are the ""awkward"" folks, so its not like they are helping her get any connections 6)  Bojack is the first man outside of her family to show her any kind of attention. 7) She's a fucking deer."

BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,FunkyFro,34,Mon Jul 20 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno. The more I think about it, the more I think fame is what's killing BoJack. I mean, all his life he's been chasing after it, but it's never satisfied him. When Diane (I think it's Diane) asks him if he'd feel happy finishing Secretariat, his only response is ""Yeah, for a little while."" When he pictures himself in the alternate universe where he goes to Maine, he's content. As long as BoJack pursues fame, he's going to continue destroying himself. No amount of it will satisfy him. The only way he'll find some semblance of peace is by dropping it altogether."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,Batteryhorse,15,Mon Jul 20 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"I agree completely  with you. But I could see the ending being the completion of his rise to fame and the subsequent realization that it won't fill the hole in his heart. After that,  he would dive into obscurity of his own choice."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,the_wolverine88,9,Mon Jul 20 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe. The book was a definite grasp for attention (he said so himself in the first episode) but the movie seemed more personal in a way. He lost heart for it when it was no longer a personal thing, even though it would have been a massive jump in fame for him, and ended up being so through the magic of CGI. I don't think this show does massive changes of heart, really. All change comes slowly, and if the show's current trends are indicators of what's happening in the future, I think BoJack's going to settle down slowly, not all at once, if at all.  I could also see the show ending with BoJack killing himself, but that's a different theory."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,Batteryhorse,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good point you make regarding his personal investments. I hope Netflix re red Bojack soon, and preferably for multiple seasons."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,the_wolverine88,7,Mon Jul 20 04:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. At least one more. I'd love more seasons, but feel like if the writers knew it were their last season, they'd be able to tidy everything up now. Later on, though... It just feels like the show keeps opening up new questions to answer. If the show's future were more secure, I'd be so down for, say, six seasons and a movie.   Guess it all comes down to hoping that Netflix makes the right decision."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,Batteryhorse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"It seems to be an overwhelming hit so I hope they do. It didn't take much time at all to renew it last time, so let's hope for the same here."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,the_wolverine88,4,Mon Jul 20 13:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think Bojack wants to do something ""meaningful"" in order to earn his fame.  I'm not sure of theater is going to change things for him, but the movie definitely didn't turn out how he wanted.  He was worried at the start because he didn't consider himself a ""serious actor"" and at the end of it all he wasn't even a part of it and all his fame felt unearned.  On top of that the realization that the audience wanted that fictional version of Secretariat and that he'd be credited for doing almost nothing really put a dent on his plans to be a serious actor."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,thefluffyburrito,20,Mon Jul 20 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"If they're willing to go this dark,  I think the show will end with bojack death as a result of his depression...  Either suicide or alcohol poisoning.    This correlates perfectly with the finale of horsing around,  in which,  he dies by not being loved enough. Bojack feels no love in this world from himself or others and It ultimately leads to his destruction."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,BubblegumIPA,8,Mon Jul 20 05:02:54 2015 UTC,"The hints to this are the suicides (accidental) from this year and then the tie back into Secretariat.  The show is very willing to go that dark.  I'm just wondering if that's the right message to send to an audience.  I relate a bit too well to Bojack's emptiness.  If he fails, it could really mess people up."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,Drakengard,5,Mon Jul 20 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"Ya,  it really depends on what netflix is willing to allow.. I feel like the writers might be willing to go that far but that netflix might want to protect their brand. Alcohol poisoning would be a good middle ground,  if he drank himself to death it would still be self induced,  however,  it wouldn't have the same message of hopelessness to vulnerable audience members."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,BubblegumIPA,3,Mon Jul 20 13:42:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like Bojack's suicide would be a bit too... predictable, I guess. It's what the story's been building up to. Secretariat, Sarah, the various predictions by the characters, etc. etc., it feels like a bit of an inevitable ending."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,ThatPersonGu,3,Mon Jul 20 14:44:37 2015 UTC,I feel like a suicide attempt would be a food way to go as well... Either way we haven't seen bojack rock bottom yet. Even with the episode 11 events

BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,Ratava,9,Mon Jul 20 03:38:58 2015 UTC,I think it's going towards him doing an off-Broadway play about Secretariat directed by Kelsey. I'm hoping that Bojack is moving towards integrity over attention.

BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,NotEtreo,7,Mon Jul 20 11:52:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's more realistic to predict the next season than the whole show.  Personally I think season 3 will see Bojack finally taking charge of his life but his past will eventually catch up to him.  I think that Penny's friend will have died or at least experienced serious issues due to alcohol poisoning and Bojack will be put on trial, forced to either tell the truth to ""be a better person"" or try to lie and swindle his way out of things."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,thefluffyburrito,8,Mon Jul 20 06:27:36 2015 UTC,"I think we're also going to see the breakdown of Diane's and mr. peanutbutters marriage. Which actually makes me sad, when it wouldn't have last season... they're really sweet together. But I just can't possibly see it working long term."
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,cassidymoon,6,Mon Jul 20 06:54:59 2015 UTC,As I see it the there's really only two ways this series will end.   1: BoJack finds himself alone as all his friends pulls themselves towards their own happiness leaving him behind. He realizes that his fame will never bring him happiness and resolves to confront his issues and to try to learn to love himself so that he can more forward without endlessly self destructing.   2: He kills himself.
BoJackHorseman,3dwfw6,missingpuzzle,6,Mon Jul 20 07:09:33 2015 UTC,"I hate the constant ""Bojack Kills himself"" theories. Mostly because they're unrealistic, for various, spoilery reasons. Personally, I think that, by the end of the show, all he'll have left is Princess Carolyn and Todd, and he'll finally start treating Princess Carolyn like a... Princess."

The pieces were all cut out, pinned together, and about halfway sewn, and I finished it up. I'm still amazed it fits, there's no reason it should fit. It's really sloppy on the inside--there's a few places that look like I got distracted or ran out of thread halfway through, then tried to patch it together later.  Also, drunk me is really industrious! Drunk me once decided to make a website, figured out how to sign up for webhosting, learned some CSS and made a custom layout, curated and edited a collection of drawings I'd made, and uploaded the whole thing.  Drunk me also frequently decides to do some baking, and then sober me gets the leftover muffins/brownies for breakfast the next day.  Drunk me has also created a few dozen custom painted or dyed tshirts.  Sober me needs to get her act together, apparently.

Tons of sadistic kids join the army because they want to shoot brown people. Tons of rapists join the military. Watch Restrepo, and The Invisible War respectively about those. Giving an 18 year old a gun and sending him over seas doesn't command my respect.  Trump on the other hand ridiculed McCain for being captured and tortured which is idiotic."
BoJackHorseman,3e02sx,capncrunch94,4,Tue Jul 21 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I've heard my fair share of fucked up stories about groups of soldiers on tour who actively hate the Iraqis where they are stationed. I recall one story I read on reddit about a guy who was helped by a farmer in some way and then this other group moved into the area after they left. The guy telling the story said that when he went back to the same are after a few months he learned they had killed the farmer while searching his house for non existent weapons. We're they heroes?  Of course the story is completely anecdotal but it really stuck with me for some reason..   furthermore the glorification of military is a way that most of us distance ourselves from the horrors of war. We tell ourselves that the men and women overseas are heroes,  elevating them to a status above regular people. By doing this,  we distance ourselves from them by not seeing them as the regular,  flawed,  scared,  scarred people they really are. It is much more convenient to see soldiers as heroes than as regular people because the much more terrifying alternative is that the people going through such an awful experience are just like you. They aren't superior,  and they aren't capable of coping with it any better than you are."

Don't get me wrong, I like Silicon Valley a lot but it seems like it follows the ""Movie star speech"" dynamic too much imo.     I understand that reaching that lowest point is important to make the audience care and that it's a commonly used trope but I feel they go a tad bit over the top in SV sometimes.   ❗Spoilers ahead❗  For me it always seem to go like this: ""oh yes we have a shot at putting PP on the map"" ""oh noes our newly found wildcard loose canon investor put his tequila bottle on the delete key!"" (This an example I found the most forced) and then back to ""oh no how are we going to find investors now?"".  This chain of events happens every 5 episodes or something whether it's Nucleus, that first investor dying or the brainrape. And sometimes it feels forced and repetitive, that's all I'm saying. I still enjoy it.  ❗Spoilers over❗  Bojack on the other hand has a lot more nuance to it for me at least. His fight with depression, alcoholism, his destructive nature, etc. Horseman is portrayed as such a complex character so far it never felt repetitive and/or forced too me.

BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,nota10yrold,8,Mon Jul 20 02:14:00 2015 UTC,"The first investor dying was because that guy actually died from cancer in real life which is sort of sad to be honest. I mean as far as I know they intended to have the series go one way up until that happened.  Honestly the reason that the show works so well is a lot of that type of stuff actually happened the whole brain rape thing is Xerox and Steve Jobs/Bill Gates. You'd be surprised what kind of shit they're actually parodying even if it's dumb things, because honestly that kind of dumb stuff actually happened in real life like that whole CEO comparing the treatment of rich people to the jews in Nazi germany. That whole delete key thing may sound dumb but honestly I've heard stories from one of my mentors about much worse that used to happen and how the littlest thing can screw up an entire mainframe."

It's too much of a rollercoaster for me to be natural I guess."
BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,nota10yrold,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:21 2015 UTC,"Silicon Valley has to be one of my top favorite shows, but I have to disagree with you. Alot of people were going to complain about ""the delete key"" situation and all the other forced writing, which they have every right to. The 1st season seemed kind of better than the second on Silicon Valley. My main problem with Season 2 in SV is that the plot got ridiculous. They kept failing repeatedly, new stupid stuff kept popping that was stopping them, and it got kind of repetitive. Doesn't mean it isn't an amazing, hilarious and well written show, but Bojack was better. There's not always a happy ending and there are so many conflicts going on with Bojack alone and the other characters."
BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,ShadowM4st3r,4,Mon Jul 20 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"Never heard of silcon valley, is it on Netflix? Also I think Bojack is like Pink Floyd, they both leave you with a different feeling imo"

BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,kefkai,6,Mon Jul 20 00:20:07 2015 UTC,"Silicon Valley is HBO so no it seems like HBO and Netflix are locked in a dead heat trying to compete with quality programming which isn't a terrible thing.   But SV is a Mike Judge series (Idiocracy, King of the Hill, Office Space etc.) the only thing Mike made that sort of really sucked was The Goode Family.  Bojack is more of an inside joke type of show sort of like AD where as SV is more of a satire which is sort of Mike Judge's specialty, honestly the only people who seem to do satire as well are Trey Parker and Matt Stone."

BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,CitizenKing,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"Silicon is better satire and situational comedy. Bojack has more jokes in general, tons more puns in particular, but also has a decent number of total misses.   At least for me, things like ""I hate to have to be the one to tell you this but David Copperfield isn't really relevant anymore."" seemed like the really obvious next line after the set up. Another examples was that as soon as the police are investigating an escaped chicken on a road, you are just waiting for the ""why did the chicken cross the road"" joke to land. When it did, it was a very straightforward quoting of the joke and felt like sort of a let down after a whole scene of build up. That brings down how ""smart"" the show comes off but it also takes intelligence to set up as many jokes as they do.   So in the end, which is smarter; satire or puns? Quality or quantity?"
BoJackHorseman,3dvv1u,timms5000,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"BoJack's strength doesn't come from its comedy, it comes from its drama. The entire point is that they soften you up with some dumb puns and a few quirky jokes here and there, and then when you've let your guard down and actually are allowing yourself to become emotionally invested, they suckerpunch you with some emotional trauma. It's genius, because most dramas these days are held at arms length. People watch them, but they know better than to become truly emotionally invested and as such only really experience a fraction of the emotional impact that they might have felt."

Usually, people describe comedies rather than dramas as ""smart"" so it seemed that side was the relevant part of the show."

BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,vis9000,51,Sun Jul 19 21:54:52 2015 UTC,I got more of a Bill Cosby vibe than I did a Letterman vibe as others have said mostly because of how it became a big deal. In real life it was Hannibal Buress telling people to Google Bill Cosby rape and saying that the allegations have been out there for years which is almost how Diane got everyone to pay attention to it in the show.
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,jaso4657,11,Sun Jul 19 23:38:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like the episode was written right after the Cosby thing broke but right before Cosby started catching flak from everyone
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,rae1988,5,Mon Jul 20 00:55:09 2015 UTC,Plus the whole being on a beloved sitcom as a fatherly figure thing. I think he was more modeled after Cosby.
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,gumptiousguillotine,2,Mon Jul 20 06:47:43 2015 UTC,Yeah the whole scenario was too close to the Hannibal buress ordeal for him to not be a stand in for bill cosby
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,dacookeymonsta,27,Mon Jul 20 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"I think he's a Cosby/Letterman hybrid. The talk show host and assistant is Letterman. But Letterman was never lovable the way Hank is supposed to be. No one is calling him ""Uncle Dave"". Bill Cosby was like a proxy father for people. That is much more in line with how Hank was treated."
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,CheruthCutestory,81,Mon Jul 20 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"No he's definitely David Letterman.  Late night show host, beloved figure, tons of complaints about sexual harassment from assistants.  That's Letterman."

BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,Semper_nemo13,12,Sun Jul 19 23:11:14 2015 UTC,"There's a ton of references in it that are very directly Bill Cosby, though. The allegations are old and public and only explode when someone says to Google them -- that's exactly like Bill Cosby last year, when the whole scandal only kicked off because Hannibal Buress publicly said ""Google Bill Cosby rape, there's more hits for that shit than for Hannibal Buress."" So was the ""you're supposed to be a journalist and you won't even tell the audience what he's been accused of"" thing -- no one refused to say what Letterman was accused of but they did for Cosby."
BoJackHorseman,3dvd89,yhiv,5,Mon Jul 20 08:49:01 2015 UTC,"True!  Man, how sad is it that this is an argument to have?  So many abusers out there."

As for Jill Pill, I really think she's important to the character of Bojack, in ways we can't quite know yet. The story is told from Bojack's perspective.

I can't say I lost respect for the character though - in older times, he probably would have pulled her inside right away. At least part of him was trying to be better - but that part was under a barrage of emotions from his feelings for her mom, and her persistence finally broke through."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,lasershurt,8,Mon Jul 20 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"But then he goes inside, and leaves the door open.   i keep seeing this and i don't get it. is he supposed to lock himself in his room? he told her no multiple times, in no uncertain terms. if she had been the one saying no i highly doubt that leaving her door open would be seen as some subtle sign that she didn't mean it all those times and secretly wanted it."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,GeauxTiger,24,Mon Jul 20 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"I think that was the self-sabotage. He definitely told her no, but he left the door open for her to try one last time (literally and figuratively). One last try was all it took for him to fail.  I don't think it meant that he really wanted it, I think his conscious self was honest in turning her down. But he has deeper demons that sometimes get their way."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,GeauxTiger,33,Mon Jul 20 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"I find it really interesting that a lot of people want to believe that nothing bad was going on or that BoJack wasn't participating or that BoJack and Penny weren't in the room for that purpose. To me, it was really clear what was happening, so I'm intrigued that people are giving BoJack that much benefit of the doubt. It goes to show how much variation there is in terms of perception of BoJack improving himself.  For me, I actually didn't lose respect for him because I didn't expect him to be above this to begin with. But not in a bad way...I'm not sure how to describe it, but BoJack is in middle ground for me. I don't respect him because he's often quite awful. But that doesn't mean I look down on him either because I can see how messed up he is and why and sympathize with his struggles because of those things.  So instead, I just felt like ""Man, you didn't have to do this..."""
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,eruru,15,Mon Jul 20 02:19:33 2015 UTC,"Bojack is the main character and people desperately want to believe that deep down he is a good person. Because many watching the show also want to believe that deep down they are good people, and if Bojack is then so are they. So him leaving the door open with the light on after telling her to go to bed? Oh he must have meant nothing by that. Her telling him to shh and keep down? Obviously he was objecting! Her undoing his bowtie? Oh maybe he was just a split second away from telling her to get off. His super guilty and ashamed expression after being caught with Penny? Oh he must just have resting-guilt-face.   I agree, people are trying really hard to think nothing bad was going on, but Bojack couldn't resist after being rejected by his dream girl after pouring his heart out to her. It was very obvious that sex was about to go down."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,ConBrio93,13,Mon Jul 20 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"It's fascinating because so many people who connect to this show do so because of their own dysfunctions (myself included), and I think how people interpret things that happen has a lot to do with their own relationship with their dysfunction. I don't wholly identify with BoJack because his depression and self-loathing manifest in a way that involves a lot more pain to third parties; mine manifests much more often as standing in my own way in solitude. But I sympathize with BoJack because at the heart of it, his sadness looks very familiar to me because of my own.  I think it also seems that where people expect the show to go or where they think BoJack is at any given time probably says a lot about where they stand in their own journey with pain. A lot of people mention redemption and thinking BoJack will eventually become whole and okay, which makes this incident all the more disappointing and surprising. Others think the logical end game of the show is suicide because they think it's unrealistic for someone with such deep dysfunction to recover. Personally, I interpret his struggle as more of a rehabilitation, and that very often means backslides and false starts.  And sadly, after having the wherewithal to verbally turn Penny down twice (hooray, some growth!), he backslides by sending a mixed message (i.e., leaving the door open) and not turning her down when she comes in."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,eruru,4,Mon Jul 20 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty fucked up, and I just kind of see this all in terms of story structure... and every season has the same structure. It's one of the seven basic plots (like pretty much anything that's not random-events or slice-of-life) and it's called 'Rebirth'.   http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenBasicPlots  And, frankly, they did it way worse this season. He didn't deserve that happy ending. It didn't even make sense. Some guy just walked up to him and literally told him the moral of the story.  That's terrible writing. I was so disappointed.   He didn't learn shit this season; hell, he didn't learn shit last season. But they didn't pretend that he did and slap a happy ending on. He got what he had wanted, goal wise, both times; but neither time did he get what he actually needed. Wait... maybe he did... maybe getting todd back, getting back to a status quo, was lesson enough. Maybe, at the end, he's finally forced to acknowledge how much he needs todd.   Fine, okay, this is good writing, he does deserve a happy ending. But the monkey dude was fucking ridiculous."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,cassidymoon,4,Mon Jul 20 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"Well, as with most things, there are exceptions, of course. :P But at least in terms of a lot of commenters in this sub who bring up their own struggles with depression/anxiety/self-worth/etc., how they describe their struggles generally seems to line up with their interpretations and expectations of BoJack and the narrative arc.  In terms of narratology and the ""there are only X stories in the world"" concept, I think there's a reason why most lists along those lines point out that they're listing the basic forms of possible conflicts. I agree with you that rebirth may be the general idea behind BoJack's narrative arc over the entire series, but I'm not convinced it's his arc on the micro-scale, which is why I think rehabilitation is a more accurate descriptor of what he is going through instead of redemption.  This is also why I don't think we HAVE had a happy ending for either season. They haven't been tragic endings either, but BoJack has not yet reached a place where his internal conflict has been resolved. He's reached certain circumstantial equilibria:    Season One: coming to terms with the book's success despite its ugly and relatable portrayal of him, being cast as Secretariat, getting back to an amicable but not entirely fulfilling relationship with Diane Season Two: getting back home, seeing that the Secretariat film has been finished even if it was without him, bringing Todd back after verbalizing to Todd how important his friendship is   But he's hardly reached a place that can be considered rebirth yet. If anything, the lessons he's learning are not moral lessons but lessons of self-understanding and self-care. The first season was about him realizing and admitting he's broken; the second season was about him attempting to fix his brokenness, only to find out that there is no ""fix,"" just the hard work of trying every day.  It may seem cheap that the jogging macaque just tells him ""it gets easier, the hard part is working on it every day,"" but BoJack has actually played this out through the season, and hearing the macaque tell him it'll get easier is reinforcement of his efforts, not just a moral on a silver platter. BoJack is still QUITE fucked up, as we can see from the boat scene at Charlotte's, but his recognition of his own fucked-up-ness has also allowed him to be emotionally honest and vulnerable, which is the real hard part and the real first steps to rebirth (see: his live-TV confession to Mr. PB about his jealousy over Mr. PB's stable self-worth, his admission to Todd that Todd is his best friend and not just the aimless bum that he spews verbal abuse at).  He'll probably continue to be fucked up because no one really resolves so much dysfunction in one go, but this season was about him beginning to work on himself so that he can become ""okay"" -- even if not ""happy"" or ""fixed"" or ""normal."" In that sense, I think the narrative arc was well-constructed.  EDIT: If the last couple days on this sub have shown me anything, it's that I'm awful at being concise. Sorry about the wall of words..."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,eruru,2,Mon Jul 20 08:28:30 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good point. Plus, this season had the arc words (and I'm only just now realizing that they were that) of ""what are you doing here"" and ""...something broken, that can never be fixed."" multiple characters say that.  And Rebirth is actually vague enough to cover rehabilitation. As much as it might pain you to admit, there really isn't that much new under the sun. There's a finite amount of things that human beings will find compelling."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,cassidymoon,2,Mon Jul 20 09:02:16 2015 UTC,"As much as it might pain you to admit, there really isn't that much new under the sun.    Haha, I'm not sure what this Ecclesiastes jab is about...it doesn't pain me at all because I never said there are infinite storylines or anything like that. I'm not saying that rehabilitation is somehow separate, I'm saying it's a specific refined form of the rebirth arc because basic plot lists are exactly that -- an examination of the most basic form that narrative arcs appear as."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,QD_Mitch,5,Mon Jul 20 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"Except the show feels like it's supposed to be about redemption. BoJack is supposed to get better as time goes on. Sarah Lynn was in S01E03, which was part of the ""before"" BoJack, when he had no redeeming qualities. Over time, he's tried and tried to get better, and after two seasons of development, you'd think he'd be above that, but there he is, doing exactly what old BoJack would do. I understand his motivation, but... Christ. I think pretty much everybody thought more of him than that at that point."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,Batteryhorse,4,Mon Jul 20 02:29:33 2015 UTC,"I think pretty much everybody thought more of him than that at that point.

Yeah, but baby steps."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,Drakengard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"Except that the show is very clearly not a redemption story. People go through personality swings and little changes here and there, but nobody actually ever changes. The show has subtly and explicitly touched on this theme multiple times. Bojack relapsing into his immoral ways is not regression from redemption; he was never going to be redeemed in the first place! This show is about struggle, struggle to be happy, to be better, to improve. But in the end the struggle for BJ is futile, as he can't change who he truly is inside. That may be a commentary on real life, or it may not be. But that concept is very real to the characters in this show."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,RD_Is_Best_Pony,2,Tue Jul 21 10:06:32 2015 UTC,Wasn't Sara Lynn like thirty at that point?
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,daboobiesnatcher,2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, Sarah Lynn is an adult. She's almost thirty by my estimate. He also wasn't taking advantage of her mother's hospitality, didn't try to break up her mom and dad, etc. It's bad but nowhere near the same thing."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,RaspberryChocolate,3,Mon Jul 20 03:11:53 2015 UTC,He did sleep with a woman who clearly viewed him as a father figure. It's double messed up because she was clearly molested by her stepfather. He did a number on poor Sarah Lynn...
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,QD_Mitch,19,Mon Jul 20 05:34:13 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the episode he got a teenage girl drunk on bourbon. Was going to just drop her at a random teenager's house until that teenager told him she should be brought to a hospital. (Also, a passed out teen girl at the home of a random teen kid. Luckily he was a really good kid but Bojack wasn't too worried.) And then dumped her in the hospital.   It isn't as though he was morally unimpeachable before that."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,CheruthCutestory,11,Mon Jul 20 01:16:22 2015 UTC,"Rationally I find it hard to be mad at him for leaving her at the hospital, because there really isn't much more he could have done for the girl at that point. Though not taking her to the hospital in the first place was awful. I also don't think getting them bourbon was the worst thing, since she was going to be drinking anyway. His method would have avoided a hangover. Though then he did nothing to stop her from going wayyyyyyy overboard."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,ConBrio93,11,Mon Jul 20 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"""Go to bed"", and then leaves the door to his bedroom open with the light on.... goddamnit Bojack. You tried absolving yourself of the responsibility because technically you told her ""no"" but then you send that huge mixed message.   Personally I don't think this act is any worse than some of the other stuff he has pulled, like trying to tear Charlotte away from her loving husband and kids based on some mutual attraction 30 years ago. Or kissing Diane who was a week away from being married."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,ConBrio93,16,Mon Jul 20 02:38:08 2015 UTC,"We seem to be forgetting a lot about Penny here.    she was 17 (of the age of consent) hadn't ingested a drop of alcohol already had condoms in her room, so quite clearly had decided she was ready before that night even started   We didn't see Bojack rape a 14 year old. We saw him almost engage in consensual sex with someone of the age of consent, who was completely sober, while Bojack himself was in a completely distraught mental state, AFTER he had refused her time and again.   I didn't lose any respect for Bojack. I actually just gained more and more pity."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,silversapphire,17,Mon Jul 20 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"I really really really really want him to have been telling her to get the fuck out of his boat.  I want him to have meant it when he said ""Go to bed"".  I want him to be a victim of a series of bad decisions that snowballed.  I want it so bad.  But... I just don't know."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,PolloMagnifico,8,Mon Jul 20 00:36:59 2015 UTC,"I've watched that scene over and over trying to reason that exact scenario out.  But I just can't see it.  She's on the bed, undoing his tie.  He's just kind of accepting it.  There's no sense of disapproval on his face.  I hate to say it, but he's guilty as sin.    I'll hold out hope that the cutaway was intentional to obscure and hide him trying to get her to leave, but it's not looking plausible at all... :/"
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,Drakengard,5,Mon Jul 20 02:41:51 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that he's reaching out to touch Penny while they're on the bed, which pretty much counters the ""she's doing things TO him"" theory."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,CannabinoidAndroid,3,Mon Jul 20 05:53:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's more complex than that. I think he really meant it when he told her to go to bed. But that doesn't mean he didn't also want to sleep with her, and for him to have given in to her moves in a moment of confusion and weakness.  A lot of people paint BoJack as a hero or a villain, but the whole point is he's just a messed up guy. He's depressed and confused, and he does a lot of bad stuff, but he doesn't have bad intentions, and he tries to do the right thing sometimes."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,vis9000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:20 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. Thats what makes him such a good character. Hes neither hero nor villian. He simply is. We want him to succeed, and we experience his failures as his friends would."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,PolloMagnifico,6,Mon Jul 20 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"I'm torn on this.  Yes, he's completely at fault, but I think for Bojack this had to happen. This was the only possible outcome of the whole interaction with Charlotte's family.  Penny is the idealized version of what he saw Charlotte as. Penny is young, beautiful, and innocent. That was Charlotte. She was too good - too pure - for Los Angeles and hence why she needed to move to Maine. And why Bojack thought if he could leave Los Angeles and be with her, then he, too, would be happy and a ""good"" person. So Bojack created this idealized version of Charlotte and Penny is how he pictures her now, even 20+ (isn't it closer to 30?) years later.  So when he bonds with Penny throughout this episode, it's not Penny he's attracted to - it's Charlotte. It just happens to be that Bojack doesn't see himself as a responsible adult (the whole ""being famous stops time"" line) so I don't think he's comprehending that age difference and, while he knows it's inherently wrong, he's absolving himself by giving her outs, etc.  Or I just typed this really quickly on my phone at work. I'll flesh out this thought later tonight when I get home. I want to post this in some other threads too."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,CannabinoidAndroid,4,Mon Jul 20 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"Gonna copy+paste this from a previous thread about the same subject:     There's something terrifying about the boat scene. I'd always been rooting for him, even through his horrible flaws and shitty self-and-other-sabotage. This is the scene that broke the illusion of Bojack. I saw the single balloon and my first thought was, ""Man, if he hadn't let her daughter in, she would have likely fallen for him after realizing how much he cared about the memories he had of her."" Then I realized: He left the door open. That was him, he knew exactly what he was doing and he did it. And we should expect him to do it. Because thats the kind of person he is.     He didn't make some stupid one time mistake that screwed it up. He was completely at fault. That's just who he's become and who he is, and its a good thing he fucked it up because if he hadn't then Charlotte would have likely ruined the good life she had to pursue one in yet another of Bojack's slew of failed relationships.     The entire episode really had my stomach twisting. It was heartbreaking and nerve-wracking to watch Bojack not as the force of reckless depression that I normally sympathize with despite its flaws, but as a force of reckless desperation that will do what it feels it needs to do to get what it wants regardless of who it hurts in the process."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,CitizenKing,0,Mon Jul 20 05:38:09 2015 UTC,"He was completely at fault.   She was a little bit at fault. She forced herself on him, even if he allowed her at the end she pushed the situation."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,hogwarts5972,3,Mon Jul 20 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"He's 50 years old and she's 17. She's a kid, she gets to be a little headstrong."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,hogwarts5972,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"There was so much manipulation on Bojack's end though. He forced his way into her life while trying to get to her mother, shoved her father aside to be her prom date, tried to get her drunk, left her friend at the hospital to avoid any sort of responsibility, and while its commendable that he turned her down twice, he tried to use her like an alcoholic uses a stiff drink when he was turned down by her mother. She's an easily manipulated teenager, he's an adult with plenty experience manipulating. All he had to do was close the door, but he left it open and its pretty damn obvious that he left it open on purpose. She wouldn't even be interested in him if he hadn't recklessly used her while trying to get to her mother."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,CitizenKing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of that. Yet the father came into the picture after Bojack asked (not shoved). And even so, I am just arguing the semantics of it being all BH's fault. It could be 1% Penny's fault, therefore not all his fault."

BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,SarieldeVergerberg,3,Mon Jul 20 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"I felt sad for him more than anything else. He built up Charlotte as his saviour so much in his head, even when the reality was completely different he tried to ingratiate himself into her life and sort of live out his wacky sitcom fantasies through her family.  When Charlotte rejected him he just responded to disappointment the way he always does: self-destruction. The really disgusting part for me was how he clearly viewed Penny as the surrogate daughter he fantasized about in Maine...he was still going to let whatever happened happen."
BoJackHorseman,3dvrq5,kefkai,3,Mon Jul 20 06:11:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly the amount of noise that he was making made me think he wanted to get caught. He knew he didn't belong there but he knew he had to burn the bridge there because he probably feels that he'd ruin their lives if he didn't.  I don't honestly know if Bojack would have gone through with anything given how many times he actively denied her but he needed to be caught so that he couldn't bring Charlotte down with him, leaving tomorrow is leaving too late.  The whole trip was essentially Bojack seeing what he missed out on being, he wants that and honestly he probably sees her as his own daughter."

I can't lose respect for him, because as he says in the finale, ""the only good thing I ever did was donate to this orphanage and I did it on accident""."

He does say that the best thing he did (on purpose) was help Todd, and he did in fact remember it all. Bojack is self destructive, but he's not completely devoid from good will, or at least enjoying doing good things. I think it's more interesting to guess when he'll do a good thing, because at the end of the day, helping Todd was quite possibly the most cliche thing that happened in the show, and yet it marks a complete twist to Bojack's character."

BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,27th_wonder,9,Sun Jul 19 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"When I first watched it I heard that he said ""well what are you doing here"" which is a deep question that shows how self-loathing bojack is, but I just got that he said it again- What are you doing here?  People have already mentioned that it appears quite a lot in this season after Bojack screws it up on set, but this was probably the most powerful instance of it."
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,Blue-Elephant,4,Sun Jul 19 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"There's also the ""What am I doing here?"" that he says at the end of the season that might top this one for me. Both are very powerful in their own way."
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,thabe331,6,Sun Jul 19 22:32:42 2015 UTC,I only checked this show out last year because it had will Arnett in the starring role. Best decision ever. I think this show might be even better than his work on Arrested Development
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,Fuck_auto_tabs,4,Sun Jul 19 21:24:41 2015 UTC,Definitely better. AD is great and overall pretty light hearted. BH is a kick to the dick almost every episode yet is still hilarious.
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,thabe331,2,Sun Jul 19 21:57:07 2015 UTC,AD is very underrated for how dark some of their jokes can be l. Its light hearted tone covers it up a bit
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,Fuck_auto_tabs,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree but I think Arnett shines in BH because he's the joker in AD. BH he is the dark, twisted center of attention and he nails it."

BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,archpope,5,Sun Jul 19 22:59:33 2015 UTC,I also noticed that Wanda wasn't in the background shots anymore in the opening theme of episode 12. It made it seem even more final.
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,remytampa,2,Mon Jul 20 05:16:18 2015 UTC,I was looking through the threads here specifically to see if someone mentioned this scene. It was my favorite of the series so far. Definitely the most relatable.

And that's why it's devastating. It digs in at something so painful people who experience it can't bare to say it to another human being. That feeling that people enjoy you, up until they see that darkness inside you. Then you mess things up."
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,Blue-Elephant,6,Sun Jul 19 22:12:13 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's an interesting observation considering how Charlotte calls Bojack a coward and yet he's the one who's not afraid of saying what all of us are too terrified to put into words."
BoJackHorseman,3du7ts,AssCrackBanditHunter,10,Sun Jul 19 22:43:15 2015 UTC,Oh he's still a coward. Just sometimes when he hits rock bottom he pulls out something real from deep inside because he finally doesn't care what others think of him. Kinda like Don draper really

BoJackHorseman,3duz8a,the_wolverine88,16,Mon Jul 20 03:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was pretty blatant. Also, the writers and animators clearly pay attention to detail so I know nothing is done by accident"

BoJackHorseman,3duz8a,capncrunch94,7,Mon Jul 20 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"Actually it's just a reference to scientology. They had a ""station"" called Sea Org which was a boat, because L. Ron Hubbard feared being arrested. A bunch of people would be chosen and were forced to do labor and live in awful conditions (todd's awful room)"
BoJackHorseman,3duz8a,eva_brauns_team,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think they actually did straddle the line a little bit between the actual L. Ron Hubbard/Scieno and The Master, just to make it even more meta. Copernicus felt more like Dodd/PSH in many scenes."
BoJackHorseman,3duz8a,capncrunch94,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:00 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I think the connections are easier too since they are talking about the same thing.

BoJackHorseman,3dv0px,gojeda09,6,Sun Jul 19 22:21:51 2015 UTC,Regarding details that bug you... Does it bug anyone else that the opening credits show Bojack has a deep pool and yet the view of his house shows a very thin flat deck?
BoJackHorseman,3dv0px,the_wolverine88,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:56 2015 UTC,Or that he doesn't have a second balcony that he could have possibly fallen out of and into his pool below?
BoJackHorseman,3dv0px,totallynotfromennis,2,Mon Jul 20 10:30:18 2015 UTC,I always thought it was a metaphoric pool. Like how the woman's leg in the advert doesn't really kick Don draper in the open in of madmen

BoJackHorseman,3dw9pm,kefkai,6,Mon Jul 20 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"Diane and Bojack make better friends than they do a couple. And PB understands Diane better than she does herself; the way he knew exactly what she needed to hear when they saw each other in the restaurant; Diane's realization that she isn't the person she thought she was after coming back from cordovia. Diane + PB is legit. Diane + Bojack should never happen, that's what her transformation during his drug trip in season 1 was all about. Bojack won't be capable of forming a positive relationship until he learns to accept himself and the fucked up things that have happened to him."
BoJackHorseman,3dw9pm,Environ_MENTAL_ist,0,Mon Jul 20 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that Bojack needs work before anything were to happen between him and Diane but honestly if you look at the season as a whole Bojack supported Diane while PB only really pushed her away. The only redemption was the end of the season and the end only happened because PB unlike Bojack isn't capable of changing and in the end represents the animal that he is, a dog. He says what he says to Diane because he misses her, dogs don't get angry when you come back they're always happy to see you.   The problem with that is PB doesn't seem like he's capable of growing he only cares about where he is right now hence the Hippo incident. PB can't help Diane grow like Bojack can. It's funny that this season really flips Bojack and Diane, Diane is the more stable one and you see Bojack making fun of her with her family and you twist it around this season and see him taking her in and being the only person willing to take her side on Hank.  Bojack is willing to throw his career away and possibly Wanda over siding with Diane that is if the only person who really needed to support her PB had, but he valued his career too much even though part of it was worrying for her safety."
BoJackHorseman,3dw9pm,Environ_MENTAL_ist,2,Mon Jul 20 08:52:54 2015 UTC,"We're never gonna see eye to eye on this. I think it's crazy for Bojack and Diane to be together, especially b/c Bojack doesn't love Diane, he just thought he did. Bojack doesn't even understand what love is. Regardless of the shortcomings of PB+Diane's relationship (which you are right, there are some) A Bojack+Diane relationship would only serve to reinforce their negative attitudes (see s2ep10). Besides, Diane needs a partner who doesn't change, that provides her with the stability she needs to feel free to change. If her partner was like Bojack, constantly needing reassurance/attention, she would never be able to change herself b/c she'd be too busy trying to change her partner.   Stop trying to make Bojack+Diane happen, it's not going to happen."
BoJackHorseman,3dw9pm,Alan43,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:43 2015 UTC,I tend to agree about friendship being better for these two than something more romantic.  PB may not be the best match for Diane but I think given how troubled both of them are they wouldn't make a good couple

BoJackHorseman,3dsu70,adityapstar,15,Sun Jul 19 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite one I've spotted so far was at the 50's-themed diner, where there's a seal with a ginger wig on serving drinks, wearing the name tag ""Ball.""  Lucile Ball was the actress who played Lucy in I Love Lucy. Thus, (Lu) Seal Ball. Puns!"
BoJackHorseman,3dsu70,Saith_Cassus,11,Sun Jul 19 14:14:12 2015 UTC,One of my favourites was from the same scene. The Marlin serving behind the bar of the diner was called Brando.  Edit: I have terrible memory. I originally thought it was Hank Marlin.
BoJackHorseman,3dsu70,SpirallingOut,9,Sun Jul 19 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"What? It was definitely Marlin Brando. He was yelling ""STELLAAA!!!"" Unless there was another marlin I missed."

BoJackHorseman,3dsu70,mrchainsaw361,4,Sun Jul 19 11:30:24 2015 UTC,My favorite in season two was the vultures flying over Herb's house after the funeral. Sort of similar to the moths in season one who fly around the spotlights at the award show.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,Semper_nemo13,24,Sun Jul 19 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point op. We're not morally outraged that penny is able to choose to have sex. We're outraged that bojack seemed to be making some progress on himself as a person, then tried to sleep with the worst possible person after already acknowledging he shouldn't. He was a guest in that home and in one night he did two different things to try and ruin it for his own benefit."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,AssCrackBanditHunter,8,Mon Jul 20 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"that's what bojack does, though, self-sabotage. rinse and repeat."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,the_pissed_off_goose,8,Mon Jul 20 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it was shitty because he was a guest in Charlotte's house. If Bojack had sex with some random 17 year old girl I wouldn't care, but he (almost) had sex with a friends daughter, who took him in when he wasn't feeling good about himself. So my feeling of disgust comes from that."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,capncrunch94,5,Sun Jul 19 22:36:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's about the relationship he has with the mother and the fact that he knows she doesn't want that for her daughter makes it bad.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,chanoodles,2,Sun Jul 19 22:54:43 2015 UTC,He was also treating her as the drug fantasy daughter he had with Charlotte. That added an extra layer for me
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,the_wolverine88,4,Mon Jul 20 03:39:03 2015 UTC,Immature but adult? like Vincent or?
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,Andh0w,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"Romantic feelings you feel when you are younger are valid feelings, that are the feelings of an adult brain. But the passion and recklessness isn't a mature feeling.  So not like Vincent at all."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,thabe331,3,Sun Jul 19 21:42:12 2015 UTC,The life experiences bojack had lets him know how much of a mistake she is making. He also knows the regret she'll feel later.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,wykydtronsf,7,Sun Jul 19 23:14:35 2015 UTC,Wait are people actually offended by this happening? As far as this show is concerned this is text book Bojack. I'm surprised he even hesitated to begin with.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,thabe331,7,Sun Jul 19 23:11:00 2015 UTC,Not offended so much as viewing this as a new low
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,wykydtronsf,2,Sun Jul 19 23:15:04 2015 UTC,That's fair.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,lasershurt,5,Sun Jul 19 23:17:49 2015 UTC,"I think his multiple refusals were a bit of growth for him, but ultimately he still caved to his darker tendencies due to her persistence.  Bettering yourself is hard when the waves keep crashing on your shore."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,DekKato,6,Sun Jul 19 23:22:38 2015 UTC,"The scene just before shows that the entire night was far more him trying to recreate his time with Charlotte than him caring about Penny.  Penny might be legitimately interested, but Bojack is just legitimately interested in fulfilling his fantasy world with Charlotte and to do so is willing to exploit the underdeveloped emotions of one of his longest friend's 17 year old daughter.  He woo'd her with a sham date night that was just him pretending she was Charlotte, and would have happily banged it out.... thinking of her mom.  There a lot of really unforgivable emotional manipulation going on that really showcases why a 40 year old guy with a 17 year old is basically always scummy."
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,DekKato,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:02:37 2015 UTC,I don't think the manipulation is unforgivable though. Most sex is just emotional exploitation on some level or another even whether it is mutually emotionally beneficial or destructive.
BoJackHorseman,3dv74e,Alan43,7,Mon Jul 20 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Uh.  I really wouldn't say that of most sex by any stretch.  A mutual benefit is not exploitative by definition.  In this situation Bojack has the emotional maturity to understand exactly what Penny wants (the romantic prom night), and to understand that isn't what he's giving her.  In fact he's taking her first time with the understanding that isn't what she's getting.  While he gets his Charlotte fantasy.  While simultaneously violating the trust that the entire family has put in him by allowing him to live with them for 2 months. It's wrong on so many levels really."
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,Sir_Fish,28,Sun Jul 19 15:41:07 2015 UTC,The funniest part of the d joke is that sign used to say Hollywood land.  The land part fell down... And everyone started calling it Hollywood.
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,sky4,11,Sun Jul 19 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"That's pretty clever of them. If this were any other show, I'd think that was a coincidence but I think BoJack's writers were most likely aware of this"
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,PrinceOWales,6,Sun Jul 19 18:09:31 2015 UTC,This just occurred to me like last week... I saw season one over a year ago.
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,sky4,6,Sun Jul 19 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"Actually, not quite. It did say Hollywoodland at first, but, per Wikipedia:    In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce began a contract with the City of Los Angeles Parks Department to repair and rebuild the sign. The contract stipulated that ""LAND"" be removed to spell ""Hollywood"" and reflect the district, not the ""Hollywoodland"" housing development.[8]   So the district was already called Hollywood, but the housing development was Hollywoodland, and the city wanted the sign to no longer be an advertisement."
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,RaspberryChocolate,13,Mon Jul 20 03:26:35 2015 UTC,"I still love the gag that whenever Mister Peanutbutter gets a banner for a party, the banner says the full order, like ""Congratulations Diane and Mr. Peanut Butter Peanut Butter Is One Word Don't Write One Word"" and in s2 ""Happy Birthday Diane Use A Pretty Font""."

I also liked how the pink runner who tells Bojack that it gets easier every time in 2:12 can be seen outside of his house running in almost every episode. (I'm not sure but I think he even runs a bit faster every time)"
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,Hopefo,6,Sun Jul 19 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"The ""A Perfect Day For Bananafish"" joke in Season 2 really got me."
BoJackHorseman,3ducgq,DelonteWestLuvXpress,4,Sun Jul 19 20:30:40 2015 UTC,I believe Bojack has a reference to House of Cards where the media is talking about a hugely impactful education bill. Of course in Bojack's universe this 'big news' is entirely covered up by...either by Beyonce falling on money or Bojack stealing from the veteran I can't remember which.
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,desperateandroid,15,Sun Jul 19 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"She was following the glowstick-balloon, and overheard her daughter on the boat  Charlotte was probably just going to ask about the balloons"
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,27th_wonder,4,Sun Jul 19 21:24:35 2015 UTC,I don't think she would have gone into the boat at all if she hadn't heard anything.
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,RaspberryChocolate,4,Mon Jul 20 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree, given the previous conversation she had with Bojack about the ballons in Echo Park, I think she may headed back and attempted to rekindle some relationship with him.  Remember she didn't about her time in a LA too much and you have Bojack who felt so strongly about her, TO DRIVE FROM LA and remember these small details from way back in the 90s. But granted given track record, it was probably doomed from the start.   Rewatched that part it, I'm wrong."
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,Mojavesunset,7,Sun Jul 19 22:59:03 2015 UTC,"or chew him out for littering. I really don't think those times meant anywhere near as much to Charlotte as they do to Bojack. She enjoyed reminiscing with Bojack but was overall kind of dismissive about her whole mentality back then. Bojack choose his path 30 years ago and although he may not have changed much, Charlotte settled down and started a family. She likely thought about Bojack ever so often, but Bojack over the years spun her memory into a grass is greener fantasy, and idealized the path he didn't take into being everything good that the path he was on was not."
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,ichooseuinternet,4,Mon Jul 20 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Really you would go up to a man after he kissed you and confessed his love for you while you're husband is asleep just to rant about littering. Remember he did stay with the family for two months and superficially he showed himself to be a decent father figure with Charlotte's daughter (driving and taking her to the prom).   I agree with you that bojackhorseman is a 5th wheel. The full house intro with her family is a huge tell. But the show is about being human, and you know we're whims our emotions."
BoJackHorseman,3dvdze,Mojavesunset,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"no i was just throwing an alternative out there, to lead into my take on it. Also, I do not know that we are whims our emotions, or what that even means."

BoJackHorseman,3drxjy,RaspberryChocolate,41,Sun Jul 19 14:58:12 2015 UTC,"Improv is their stand in for Scientology. The stuff with the boat and people being sent to work on a boat as punishment is also stuff drawn from real life Scientology.  Improv is also used just because some improv people get a bit too involved with improv and it can make for good joke material on the show. So they spoof improv with that while at the same time having it be a stand-in for Scientology.  It might also require some context that Scientology is notorious for going after anyone who disparages them, they're very sue happy and well funded. So they make it incredibly clear that the cult joke is not about Scientology. Which of course it is about Scientology."

BoJackHorseman,3drfj8,doodler1977,4,Sun Jul 19 07:34:16 2015 UTC,"that's incredible.  it's like in the first episode where they're shooting Secretariat, and the scene is all about Secretariat feeling pressured and losing faith in his abilities.  And Bojack doesn't know how to act in that situation, but the rest of the episode, he's living that situation, and asking people ""why are you here?""  He's oblivious to life."

But that didn't happen, BoJack once again destroyed his relationship there.  This terrifies me because I too suffer from depression, and I see myself in Bojack.  If he can one day be happy, maybe I can too.  But he's broken and may never be fixed, and I hope to god that isn't true for me too."

BoJackHorseman,3dqntz,youdontlookitalian,17,Mon Jul 20 04:50:49 2015 UTC,"I found myself absolutely loving this season. Bojack and Diane really hit close to home as their nihilistic fueled depression spun out of control, and I found it insane how much I could empathize with an animated 50 year old cartoon horse.   I didn't think this season wasn't as overtly comedic as the first, which for me was a bonus. Instead of there being equal parts comedy and drama, the comedy was a bit more subtle and silly...it was there to accent the drama and characters, and kept me from feeling like shit (like at the end of Escape from LA).   That end scene though, it was really uplifting and kept me wanting more of the show. It really should be the mantra for /r/getmotivated for a bit."
BoJackHorseman,3dqntz,azpx,-8,Sat Jul 18 22:17:53 2015 UTC,I hated the end scene. Bojack was unendurable in Episode 1 when he's all perky and new age. It seems like they're setting him up for that again in Season 3. I don't want to see Bojack happy. That would be boring as shit.

Now here he's actually made progress. He wants to change. And now realizes it takes work, not just an urge for it to happen. At the end of the season he is actually putting in that effort"
BoJackHorseman,3dqntz,wheeow,4,Sun Jul 19 03:12:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's gonna happen. They made him annoying to show he really wasn't happy. He's going to keep trying of course, but as this season has shown, he's broken. I wouldn't say he's unfixable though, but I think his goal to be truly happy is unrealistic.   Instead I think he's going to realize that there is no panacea or quick fix to his depression, loneliness, narcissism, etc... and it's going to be a process. In the end he'll probably learn to stop hating himself and settle with the normal ups and downs of life."

BoJackHorseman,3dqntz,repostusername,-8,Sun Jul 19 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"This might be unpopular but I really don't like this line. I'm my opinion what makes the show great is that nobody in LA can be happy, not Diane not Princess Carolyn, not Mr peanut butter, and especially not Bojack, but they keep trying which either leads to failure or the realization that what they thought they were working towards won't make them happy. So the idea that you just have to keep going is a lie that everyone keeps telling themselves so that they can keep living. Or maybe that's the point of the show. To keep trying until eventually you die."
BoJackHorseman,3dqntz,TheSeanGils,27,Sat Jul 18 20:37:22 2015 UTC,"You're thinking like BoJack.  That mentality isn't across the board for all of the characters... I personally live in LA and I love it!  As Charlotte says in s2ep11, ""You're the tarpit, it doesn't matter where you live.""  The show isn't that bleak.  It's not saying ""we're all unhappy and that's that.""  It's making the point that our attitude and our actions effect our happiness... and that's something that we really do need to work on every day."

He seemed like the guy that tries TOO hard to be your buddy that he comes off as a douche.  This season you actually get to see a different side of him.  He's much more relatable and has realistic struggles with Diane.  I actually can't wait to see where his character goes now, as opposed to last season where I just didn't care."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,The_Iron_Zeppelin,44,Sat Jul 18 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Man what he did for Diane at the end of S2 was so kind, it convinced me that he really is a kind person (dog). He can definitely be an asshole, but it's rare that he's doing it on purpose, and almost never unprovoked."

BoJackHorseman,3drp82,eruru,28,Sun Jul 19 08:32:48 2015 UTC,"I said this in another thread, but I really love the extra attention Mr. Peanutbutter got because I think it explores depth of character for people like him -- the type that aren't depressed and constantly questioning themselves. People get the impression that there's not much going on in their heads and that they're just lucky to have great lives and to be able to like themselves. But that's obviously not a fair assumption.  This show seems to speak best to those who suffer the same angst as BoJack, so it was really refreshing to see them give similar dimension to someone like Mr. PB, who isn't like BoJack at all."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,totallynotfromennis,7,Sun Jul 19 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"I can relate to Mr. Peanutbutter moreso than any other character. Out of all of my friends, I'm the goofy lighthearted one that goes out of my way to make the best of a situation or find the silver lining on something, albeit I'm a bit more pragmatic and not as compassionate as he is.  Thing is... I know there's something inside of him, just waiting to burst out. I just know that he's on the same page as everyone else what with being miserable and depressed, but under the pressure of constantly keeping a positive image and having people look up to him or idolize him (Bojack included).   When he snaps, that'll most likely be the first time I bawl my eyes out this entire show. I came close several times before, but seeing the real side of him will just be so fucking real... too real."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,Donktor_Jcon,5,Sun Jul 19 04:26:09 2015 UTC,"I know there's something inside of him, just waiting to burst out.   I think this is definitely plausible. In the second season, Diane went from having her shit together (for the most part, anyway) to being as apathetic and prone to wallowing as Bojack was in the first.  If Bojack has been depressed the entire show, and Diane can reach a similar malaise to his after Cordovia, then I wouldn't be surprised to see the other core characters reach a similar level of self-destruction."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,kittenlover27,29,Sun Jul 19 14:07:59 2015 UTC,He's like a toned down version of Rob Lowe's character of Chris on parks and rec.   I love how they showed more of his struggles in this season.

BoJackHorseman,3drp82,DeeFB,6,Sun Jul 19 06:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yes! He was definitely the weakest of the main five characters in season 1. In season 2, he's still the same guy, the writers just gave him a lot more to do."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,TomBombomb,4,Sat Jul 18 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you completely. He felt much better in this season."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,SlyGuy123,8,Sat Jul 18 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the show is making a pretty strong case that, despite the fact that we were supposed to view Mr. Peanutbutter as a sort of nemesis in season one, he's actually a good person.  BoJack has done a lot of horrible things, and in the penultimate season two episode he does something I think is irredeemable.  Mr. Peanutbutter may be thoughtless and a doofus, but he genuinely is trying to make the people he cares about happy.  I think it was great that in season two, when people treated him like crap, you actually saw him get legitimately sad or legitimately angry."
BoJackHorseman,3drp82,Alan43,7,Sun Jul 19 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"He's naiive, overly loyal, easy-going, and carefree, but he's not stupid.  Just like a good dog."

BoJackHorseman,3dqrtt,Castriff,5,Sun Jul 19 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"That's true, and definitely a good point about them working together before, I think that definitely rules her out. My other guess is Joelle Clark, since they worked together and she has a history of being in the theater, but I feel like they wouldn't have introduced her this season if it was her."
BoJackHorseman,3dqrtt,The_R4ke,6,Sun Jul 19 04:44:37 2015 UTC,"Also PC said ""other tv show"" and Joelle was on Horsin Around, if it was her it would seem weird to not address that.

BoJackHorseman,3dqe14,hot_mayo_gate,4,Sat Jul 18 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"Season 2 seems to be much more about self examination. The questions ""What are you/am I doing here?"" are at the heart of everyone's story. Everyone asks it of themselves and others, whether literally or figuratively. And there's a moment for everyone when the question makes a change. PC in the painting when she's figures out the hectic life is for her (though she still needs to break out of her rut). Diane several times, but most importantly on her way back from Cordovia. Episode 6 BoJack wonders what Wanda is doing in his life, unable to accept for the most part that she's happy to simply be there.  I'm sure I could think of more examples, but it's 1am and I have to work in the morning, I'm sure y'all get my drift."

BoJackHorseman,3dte6m,Redneckpip,6,Sun Jul 19 08:04:25 2015 UTC,"He says it to Diane in season one. Essentially, he avoids thinking about death by filling his life with petty bullshit. You work and you work and you work and then you die and that's life.  This sticks with me every time he decides to start a new business or show. He isn't happy, he's just constantly pretending to be."
BoJackHorseman,3dte6m,Aquaman_Forever,3,Sun Jul 19 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"I always figured he is the type of person that isn't really heavily self reflective.  Sometimes self reflection can bring you deeper into a downward spiral and those who are too self aware can get caught in it. MPB is the kind of person that they don't understand. The kind of person that can just brush off these things without a  problem. He has his doubts and insecurities but he doesn't dwell on them and just focuses on thins that make him happy or will make him happy. where as Diane and Bojack are too busy wondering why they are sad and unfulfilled, MPB  moves on to the next thing"
BoJackHorseman,3dte6m,PrinceOWales,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Speaking about struck a chord, in the season 1 finale Diane is talking to Mr. PB about going to write for Sebastian to do some good. Mr. PB says ""The Universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to happiness isn't the search for meaning, it's to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you'll be dead.""  I loved this scene not only because it was my philosophy already, but because it made Mr. PB more of a 3-Dimentional character. I had a hunch that Mr. PB was just as sad and empty as Bojack, but where Bojack distracted himself with sex, drugs, and alcohol, Mr. PB decided to just fuck around and be compulsive.  He was always happily distracted by literally the dumbest thing that he or Todd could come up with and he is literally a dog, the animal famous for being able to run after a stick for hours and hours.  Some other randoms and I wrote a bit about the whole thing if you're up for the read."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,leeconway92,78,Sat Jul 18 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"There's something terrifying about the scene. I'd always been rooting for him, even through his horrible flaws and shitty self-and-other-sabotage. This is the scene that broke the illusion of Bojack.     I saw the single balloon and my first thought was, ""Man, if he hadn't let her daughter in, she would have likely fallen for him after realizing how much he cared about the memories he had of her.""     Then I realized: He left the door open. That was him, he knew exactly what he was doing and he did it. And we should expect him to do it. Because thats the kind of person he is.     He didn't make some stupid one time mistake that screwed it up. He was completely at fault. That's just who he's become and who he is, and its a good thing he fucked it up because if he hadn't then Charlotte would have likely ruined the good life she had to pursue one in yet another of Bojack's slew of failed relationships.     The entire episode really had my stomach twisting. It was heartbreaking and nerve-wracking to watch Bojack not as the force of reckless depression that I normally sympathize with despite its flaws, but as a force of reckless desperation that will do what it feels it needs to do to get what it wants regardless of who it hurts in the process."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,CitizenKing,35,Sat Jul 18 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way. BoJack had everything crumble around him, his last ace-in-the-hole to make him feel complete and it backfired. So he knew he had to close the door, but didn't because he wanted someone to make him feel better about himself, to validate him after his hope blew away."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,tland88,11,Sat Jul 18 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"I think he left it open because he knew deep inside that this wasn't working and that he had to leave. However, he needed someone to kick his ass or he would have never left, so he left the door open knowing that Charlotte or someone would notice it and catch them.  I also think that BoJack is most comfortable when his world is falling apart. It's clear from the beginning of the season that he has no idea how to handle a life where gets what he wants."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,The_R4ke,3,Sun Jul 19 00:35:28 2015 UTC,I don't think that he knew that at all. He's good at sabotaging himself without even knowing he's doing it.
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,fuck_the_DEA,8,Sun Jul 19 19:55:09 2015 UTC,I honestly think if the writers have the foreknowledge they'll end the series with bojack killing or sacrificing himself.
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,antihexe,29,Sat Jul 18 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno man. A tv show that shows us someone deeply unhappy that ends in suicide? I'm not saying it's not realistic, but it sure does shit of the idea of hope if even characters in a tv show can't find redemption sometimes."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,AssCrackBanditHunter,17,Sat Jul 18 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"The entire show is about ""nothing we do makes a difference"" and ""you're broken and can't be fixed"" that's what living with depression feels like. I can tell first hand, medication will help,  even therapy, counseling, finding hobbies, making goals constantly changing. But for some with depression in the long run we question our existence and know we are just distracting ourselves to live long enough for something."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,kittenlover27,12,Sat Jul 18 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"The problem of the show -- or at least, the problem of BoJack -- is ""I can't be good no matter what I do"" and ""you're broken and can't be fixed."" But I would be hard-pressed to say that that's what the show is about. It's about the whole package of those feelings, including how we cope with them.  Season 1 was largely BoJack getting to a point where he openly acknowledges his deep fear of his own worthlessness, which happens because he opens up for the first time in who knows how long. He thinks Diane sees him as good and likable despite all of the shit he unearths for her to write his book, but when he realizes that she doesn't seem to see him as good per se and instead finds that he feels the book makes him look awful, it makes him panic because that's not how he wants to be seen and that's not what he wants to be. Hence, the drug-induced mental break he has in Downer Ending. Hence, his conversation with Diane on the rooftop and his saying that he just really wanted her to like him.  This season is him trying to fix that in more wrong ways, most of them contrived (the George Takei self-help audiotape). And the best part, in my opinion, is him getting to the point where he does some things right, including going to get Todd from the improv cult and verbalizing the importance of Todd's friendship to him. He's far from being okay and it's true that some of us can't be ""fixed,"" but with the jogging macaque at the end, the show says that even if those things don't happen, if you keep doing the hard part -- doing the work every day -- it gets easier."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,eruru,5,Sun Jul 19 06:36:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's not what I get from the show at all. The way I see it, the show is about how we're all responsible for our own happiness. Bojack keeps looking to other people to fill the emptiness he feels, when he is the one that has to fill it. But it's hard work. This show is all about hope, but just hope isn't enough."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,huffimus_prime,11,Sun Jul 19 05:12:45 2015 UTC,"I thought about that a lot this season.  I actually thought that when he didn't show up at Wanda's sister's place he was going to pull onto the bridge and replay the Secretariat suicide scene.  I don't honestly think its likely they'll go this route.  But if they do, I think that's how its set up; by Secretariat's suicide, which could be used as just that kind of foreshadowing and plays into the theme of how Bojack's broken dreams are built on the shaky ground of his hero's mistakes."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,DekKato,18,Sat Jul 18 23:21:32 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely see him reaching a dark place and going the suicide route, that's what this is building up to... but odds are he's going to be saved at the last minute by his friends. Because as we've seen in the last 2 seasons, as fucked up as bojack is, he's actually making real relationships with people for the first time in his life, and that's going to be his saving grace.  There's no way this show is going to end with bojack's for real suicide. What message does that send to the audience? ""Some people are so unhappy and undeserving of happiness they die, the end."" That's a downer ending for the sake of being a downer. Not to mention it wouldn't do any favors for unhappy people that see a part of themselves in Bojack."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,AssCrackBanditHunter,6,Sat Jul 18 23:27:15 2015 UTC,Suicide for Bojack would be completely uncharacteristic. He's a narcissist through and through- and narcissists don't kill themselves.

I am sure he has a huge liver, being a horse and all but he has some pretty hard alcoholism which is known by everyone.  He has not made any real connections with people, considers most of them just a funtime thing."

BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,needmorecharact,9,Mon Jul 20 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'll be really disappointed if that's how they end the show. Bojack is self-destructive and deeply depressed but he's trying. I deeply empathize with that. I know the show tries to point out how pointless closure is but I have a need to see Bojack find a sort of stability. I'm finding it hard to do that for myself right now and I'm barely in my 20s.   I know I shouldn't be looking to television for my answers but this show is the closest I've seen any media ""get"" depression and I can't bear to see Bojack just offing himself. What kind of message does that send after everything he's already done?"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Professor_Laser,4,Sat Jul 18 23:44:45 2015 UTC,Have you ever read Hyperbole And A Half?  There's an amazing two parter about depression.  Part 1  Part 2.

BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Professor_Laser,3,Sun Jul 19 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"I know the show tries to point out how pointless closure is but I have a need to see Bojack find a sort of stability. I'm finding it hard to do that for myself right now and I'm barely in my 20s.   That's why it's so great! It's honest about how subtle it is. These moments sneak up on all of us even if we're rich, famous, and well connected. The reality of the matter is that things don't get easier -- you just get used to it. (Like the show said!) Do you really want some T.V. show to lie to you?    What kind of message does that send?   It sends the message that for some people life is way harder than it should be, even given all of the luxuries of 1st world ++++ life. It's realistic. People die all of the time even though they had living conditions way better than Mohamed in desert, drought, famine, Africa. It validates the experience. And hopefully along the way it helps me and you."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,antihexe,7,Sat Jul 18 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not expecting it to get easier for him, you're right that it's unrealistic and would ruin the honesty that the show has. I'm just saying I would prefer to see Bojack find at least some of what he's looking for when the show ends rather than watching him kill himself. It doesn't have to be real closure but I'm just saying I would prefer to see him able to live with himself so I can imagine him being happy sometimes.   I don't think I could stand to watch him kill himself. The show is already real enough as it is, I don't need him giving up after all the effort he makes to improve himself and his striving for happiness. I want to see somebody with chronic depression succeed. If I wanted to see that kind of character die, so many other shows already fill that hole. This show doesn't seem to be the kind that would just go ahead and do that, so if the crew did I would consider it abandoning the fanbase.  I probably sound really depressed writing this and that's because I am right now. I'm trying what I can to deal with that and I still relapse into these moods sometimes. I want to believe it gets better but it's already so hard to see that."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Professor_Laser,3,Sun Jul 19 00:33:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you certainly have the time over me so maybe that's why you've given up but I'm not yet willing to give into subsistence or suicide. I don't want subsistence to be my life. I think it's possible to get beyond that and I've made really great progress lately. This current bout of depression is after several weeks where I've felt actually really good.   You can't kill depression forever but I think you can keep it in check if you actually put the effort forward. I've been allowing myself more sleep, replacing my bad habits with productive ones, actually exercising multiple times a week. It makes an actual difference. Maybe you need something else. Maybe you need to put in more effort. Either way I know there's an answer that isn't living in mindless misery.  I hope you find something beyond suicide or subsistence because those are definitely not your only options. I'm pulling for you.  Also I wasn't talking about shows where the main character killed themselves, I was talking about shows where the depressed person kills themselves or otherwise never improves themselves. I'm not happy with that. It's a lazy trope and a shitty way to depict the illness."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Professor_Laser,2,Sun Jul 19 00:49:56 2015 UTC,"Have you seen Mad Men? It's not overtly about depression like BoJack Horseman is, but the character arc for Don Draper is basically an examination of a very broken and fucked up man, how he hurts and lashes out at others, how others deal with him, how he's frequently at grips with an existential pain that he has no idea how to acknowledge or treat. When the series finale was about to air, one of my favorite ads for it was this one, which really brought into focus just how much the show wasn't just a period piece or about advertising, but about how incredibly flawed and in pain Draper is. It's the other show that I've seen people try to make an argument for the arc ending in suicide because of the way the opening credits are designed (coincidentally, there are some great crossovers where people put the Mad Men theme song against the BoJack Horseman opening visuals, and it works perfectly).  I think a lot of us with depression or similar issues feel like it would be inauthentic to have characters like this end up happy because depression feels like and often is like an albatross around your neck that is never going to come off. But personally, I was incredibly satisfied with how Draper's character arc ended, and I feel like writers who examine depression and brokenness honestly are capable of writing arcs that don't end in ""everything became sunshine and rainbows"" but also don't end in ""it's all pointless."" And I also think that's the kind of narrative a lot of us really need to see."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,eruru,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's exactly what I'm trying to say. I haven't watched Mad Men bit I'm glad we're in agreement here.   Watching a depressed character die of suicide doesn't help anyone with depression. It only encourages those easy depressive thoughts rather than leading to possible real change.   Bojack season 1 affected me hard. Since watching it, I changed my life in huge ways that have elevated my base happiness. I still have my moods where everything is terrible but I'm better at recognizing they're just moods and they will pass.   It doesn't have to be sunshine and rainbows, that's what episode 1 of season 2 is about. Bojack isn't actually solving his problems; he's avoiding them with cheap, happy, feelgood trash. Real improvement takes real work, critical evaluation of yourself and your relationships. I think if Bojack really wants to improve, he will. Suicide is not the only solution and you're right in that people need to see that."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Professor_Laser,2,Sun Jul 19 06:50:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see the show going there at all. I think when the show ends, there will be no easy solution or clear cut ending. There won't be anything definitive."

BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,27th_wonder,5,Sat Jul 18 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"If it was to repeat, I see it as being one more past connection that he had with somebody, thinking he can reconnect. History ended up repeating itself, and with Charlotte's scene reminding me of Herb's f-bomb in the first season, they really make a strong impact with a four-letter word. When Charlotte said it, I have a sad feeling that this may be the last we see of her unless the writers have more up their sleeves."

This is the second time he's tried to force himself back into his old life, and both times he completely obliterated his chances of building a decent relationship with his old friends. This time though, now that both bridges are burnt and there's no old memories to fall back on, it may lead to some real decent change."

Yeah, Bojack is such a bad guy that he knew turning down penny twice before leaving a door open would instantly mean that he had a greater chance of insitgating shit for his own personal benefit.  Because there's no way he left the door open after everything that happened just because he wanted to see if someone, anyone, would see if he was okay.  Shit people, this is not a black and white show, and a lot of people ask interesting questions and raise good discussion points on themes introduced into this show.  I think an even more interesting result is the audience's reaction in pinning Bojack as lower than low for that scene, and that scene alone. Are we just going to ignore that Penny was being forward coercing Bojack? Trying to rationalize how it is legal, how she can make choices for herself, and after Bojack Fucked up with Charlotte, knew he had to leave the next morning, STILL said no to Penny, and You all want to hark on him for leaving a fucking door open?  Yeah, he was just asking for it, right?"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,22,Sun Jul 19 05:56:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, he's a fifty one year old man who went to prom with a bunch of teenagers, plied them with alcohol, and then ended up in bed with an eighteen year old daughter of an old friend... an old friend who he also just kissed and asked to leave her husband and children.  I think it's not irrational to lay the fault at BoJack's feet here because he's thirty-three years older and should know better.  The show isn't only a depiction of depression, it's also a character study in self-destructive behavior, learning to love yourself, and coping with past mistakes.  The recurring ""broken"" theme is because BoJack doesn't know how to take care of himself, he's dealing with a lot of childhood emotional baggage, and so he turns to outward validation.  He watches shit burn.  For me, it's okay to watch this show, root for the guy, and still answer his constant question: ""Am I a good person?"" with a ""No.  Not yet."""
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,TomBombomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"I just want to define something here.   he's a fifty one year old man who went to prom with a bunch of teenagers, plied them with alcohol,   As 'strange' as this description sounds, and easy it is to jump to a conclusion, Charlotte also thought it would be a good idea for Bojack to take penny to the prom. So there is nothing creepy or wrong in that. In the alcohol department, they were already drinking. Sure, Bojack just taught them all an invaluable lesson on how to drink cheap and efficiently, which isn't advice I'd pass onto a crippling alcoholic, but dumb teenagers who just mix Red Bull and Vodka on prom night?  Shit man, I know he didn't care if he was cool or not to the little social circle's, but he is still seeking validation from others around him.  Bojack can relate to these guys, remember he hasn't had any real emotional growth since becoming famous, and didn't have a typical childhood. To him these kid's snarky attitudes and go big or go home is a direct spotlight to the way people in ""hollywoo"" still act, the behaviour that fuels his self destructive habits.  When Fat chick started throwing up, and the suggestion of ""alcohol poisoning and died"" came up,we all of a sudden jump to an EXTREME end of where the night might end up going, which kicked Bojack in the arse and made him realize how he will be the one held responsible if anything goes wrong.  Shit's his pants, and then we come to the emergency room scene, where you're right, it's just Bojack trying to cover his arse, because he's afraid of the worst case scenario, which look at everyone here, is exactly how everyone was going to react.  He became so scared of everyone jumping to the worst conclusion about him that he scared a kid into lying to the hospital about where she got the Alcohol from, and mentioning him and Penny.   and then ended up in bed with an eighteen year old daughter of an old friend... an old friend who he also just kissed and asked to leave her husband and children.   This is where it comes down more to Bojack Fucking up. I just feel like everyone is focusing on the wrong points. Bojack trying to convince charlotte to run away with him is a choice and action bojack made. Leaving a door open, and surmising that that action is what made him the worst, that's what annoy's me.  Bojack did a lot of selfish, unjust shit. But he really did try to keep his self control from doing what was feeling good, in a time where he was feeling at his absolute worst.  If the door had been closed, and we still moved onto the scene of Charlotte hearing noises from the boat, Penny telling Bojack to ""shh be quiet."" I still feel like everyone would attack bojack for having not been 'a bigger man.'"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,6,Sun Jul 19 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"I'm all commented out, so I can't muster the energy to dive fully into what you wrote here at the moment, but I have to point out:   As 'strange' as this description sounds, and easy it is to jump to a conclusion, Charlotte also thought it would be a good idea for Bojack to take penny to the prom.    Charlotte actually NEVER says she thinks it'd be a good idea. In fact, when BoJack is pitching the idea, he's mostly framing it as a spite gesture against Diego (Penny's crush who didn't ask her out), which, of course, gets Penny all excited because she's a teenager and teenagers are frequently petty about silly things like this. (I should note, this kind of says a lot about BoJack's maturity level too.)  Through the whole thing, Charlotte is confused at best, saying things like, ""How is that cold?"" and ""Wait, I'm sorry, but don't you WANT to dance with Diego?"" BoJack then tells her to stop poking holes in the idea, which Penny echoes before telling her dad that BoJack is taking her to prom. Charlotte rolls her eyes at this point. She may not have said, ""No, this is a bad idea,"" but she definitely was leaning way more towards not getting it than she was to backing it."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,eruru,3,Sun Jul 19 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"Some good points. It underlines that comment made earlier in the series; the idea that Bojack became famous in his early 20s, and now he's got the mindset of a mid-20s person whilst being over twice that age. I think this is why he connected so well with the teenagers.  That's part of what made the episode so sad and Bojack's actions so fucked up (irrespective of what people might feel about Penny).  Then again, I guess we were all waiting for how he'd fuck up the whole boathouse saga. That was a given. I just didn't think the show would do it so spectacularly (seriously I was practically gnawing off the armrest of my couch)."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Karetan,3,Sun Jul 19 07:02:34 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not so much about the door being open or closed, though I do tend to agree that, in a show with as much attention to detail as this one, I don't think it was an accident that he left it open.  I think the problem here is when Penny comes into his room, he doesn't tell her to leave.  Because you're right, he did try to keep his self control up to a point... until he decided that he didn't want to and that maybe sleeping with his friend's kid was a good idea.  He was on that bed with her and he didn't look like he wanted things to stop.  I think when folks are making the ""door open"" argument, what they're really saying is that here BoJack is again, talking a big game about doing the right thing, but when it comes down to action, he fails to follow through.  He was selfish and pathetic.  I would also say that, generally, just because someone is emotionally stunted, it doesn't excuse them.  Everyone would assume the worst case scenario about him because they'd be right.  He was the adult supervision and instead of, you know, saying ""stop drinking"" he basically said ""here's how you drink more efficiently.""  The dude causes chaos in other people's lives.  I'm not going to give an eighteen year old the same decision making ability in that situation as a person who is over three decades older than her.  He basically chose the worst possible thing he could have done and did it.  Charlotte was right when she told him to get the fuck out."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,TomBombomb,2,Sun Jul 19 11:50:23 2015 UTC,"Stop drinking?  Wait, so if these Legal young adults were a year older, still being relatively young, legal adults, it would have been just another social situation with alcohol right? Everyone drinks alcohol, There is no Law saying how much alcohol you are allowed to drink. But in this context Bojack was ""supplying and being a bad influence"" when the kids were drinking anyway?  I think it's important that we seperate the things Bojack did, to the things we think bojack wanted.  Everyone here has assumed that Bojack wanted to sleep with the 17 year old girl. After saying No twice, Penny followed him into the room.  Now, let me just get this right; In his posiiton, with her coming onto him, trying to untie his bow, and telling him to ""shhh, Shh."" What do you read out of this information?  Bojack is already trying to fight this, He can't just PUSH her out of the room, he can't Just THROW her off him, she might take that the wrong way and hit her self confidence.  It is the assumption in this thread that Bojack was going to go through with sleeping with Penny. Is it possible that Penny could have seduced him into just letting go and going with it? Yeah, absolutely, and in which case no matter how shit he felt, succumbing to those basic emotions would have been a failure of his moral character. (The one he wants to be anyway)  Charlotte barged in right in the middle of Penny coming onto him, he had no time to descalate the situation. No time to even try and talk her into one of his speech's on how this won't work, how he's here to feel good about himself, not just feel good. We know Bojack can step back and have those meaningful speech moments, and it makes me angry that no one can imagine at all, Penny trying to sex him up, and Bojack STILL, managing to shut the situation down with an elegant speech.  Because we know Bojack, we know that isn't a guarantee, but I also don't think it's a guarantee that Bojack was going to have sex with her. That is the Audience's interpretation from how Charlotte saw it."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,5,Sun Jul 19 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"What do you read out of this information?   That an emotionally vulnerable 17 year old girl was enabled by a 51 year old man's poor choices (some of which just put her best friend in the hospital with alcohol poisoning) to form an attachment to him and act impulsively. He's almost three times her age, he should know better.   and hit her self confidence.   Oh, and like having sex with an older man who's in love with your mother and is going to leave the next day wouldn't hurt her self-confidence?   All of the previous scenes of this episode and the general trajectory of Bojack's character foreshadowed his going through with it. He's a narcissist who was just shot down. Narcissists seek validation by any means, especially when they haven't been indulged by people whose opinions they value.   You're looking for gray on a skunk."

Look, I'm not naive, people drink underage all the time, but you can't convince me that what BoJack did was just wacky ol' Uncle B.J. being wacky!  I don't see how you can look at that character and not see that he's a bad influence on, hell, not just children, but anyone.  There's no way a fifty-one year old should be hanging out with eighteen year olds and helping them get only more drunk... and the only thing that stops him is ""holy shit I might get in trouble.""  You think Charlotte had that in mind when she let him escort her daughter to prom?  Come on, man they're kids.  High school students are kids, and the power dynamic there is all sort of wrong.  What do I read from the situation?  First, what I read is that he didn't move.  He was laying passively when she was next to him.  That's not the behavior of someone trying to extract themselves from a situation.  Honestly man, it's kind of odd that you're calling Penny the aggressive seductresses and laying this interaction completely on her.  I mean, holy shit, I did dumb stuff - A LOT of dumb stuff - when I was seventeen/eighteen.  Now I don't doubt that she was doing something she thought she wanted, but, again, she's a teenager.  He's 51.  What that shows me is that BoJack wasn't saying no, he wasn't saying ""what the hell are you doing"" or even moving out of the way.  That itself is fucked.  BoJack's moments of self-awareness are rare, and nothing he was doing in New Mexico was him being self-aware.  He was running away.  His interaction with Penny is not him being a good guy, and Charlotte didn't overreact given what she knows of the guy.  Look, BoJack doesn't love Charlotte.  He loves the idea of the past before he made all of his mistakes, he loves the idea of being young again where things are ahead of him and he sees potential."

BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,-7,Sun Jul 19 04:28:23 2015 UTC,It was just fondant on the misogyny cake that was your comment. Bojack did a terrible thing. Defending him is shitty.
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Nabokchoy,12,Sun Jul 19 04:32:53 2015 UTC,".... What the hell was misogynistic about my comment?  The fact that I want to open the discussion on this bojack character proves I hate women? What the fuck?  I talk about how Penny is a legal adult, responsible for her actions as much as the next person, treating her with respect, still understanding that Bojack was doing the right thing by not saying yes to Penny, ""You don't know what you want."" and this points to my comment being an apt description of misogyny?  You read a key word, made your own interpretation of what I meant, and now labelled me a misogynistic prick. That is on you."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,-6,Sun Jul 19 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well, you're insistent about Penny seducing Bojack. Nothing of the kind happens. She's a confused kid who thinks that she wants to have sex with an older man because that man encouraged her to feel that way. He shot her down twice, sure, but that doesn't forgive the emotional baiting that goes on throughout the rest of the episode. Bojack used Penny and her friends to feel wanted, relevant and cool. Part of that included transferring his unrequited feelings for Charlotte on to her ingenue daughter. And he played the role of knowing authority during the alcohol poisoning scare, further establishing himself as someone Penny could trust. That's incredibly fucked up and borderline predatory. That you demand forcing ambiguity into a cut and dry abuse of the power Bojack has over an impressionable teen is misogynistic. Whether or not the age of consent is 17 in NM, Bojack has clearly behaved unethically throughout the epsidoe*, and Penny is not an adult no matter how you equivocate. Like, how old are you? If you're still a teenager then I can understand, but if you're 21 or over then you ought to be ashamed for thinking that a 17 year old is capable of making informed decisions in these circumstances.  *Edit: typo, but left t for the deer pun"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Nabokchoy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"And I'm not insistent, I'm telling you what happened in the show. It's animated, there a subtitles showing Penny's voice saying shhh shh, she has more than one scene where she tried to engage bojack.  Why is it okay to ignore all these things, but we can't overlook 'leaving the door open' and the fact that Charlotte walked in at the EXACT moment penny sat on bojack.  Yeah, he didn't push her off. If he did you might've been mad though right? All he had to do was communicate to her that he wasn't interested right? It's not like he did that twice before, right?"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,3,Sun Jul 19 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"Why is it okay to ignore all these things   HOLY SHIT, SHE'S 17 AND HE IS 51! What are you not getting about this? He was the responsible adult. He abused that responsibility and the power that came with it. It doesn't matter if he denied her a dozen times before— allowing her into his bed was wrong, and he literally, yes, literally Lana, left the door wide open for her."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Nabokchoy,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:36:18 2015 UTC,"So every 16 and 17 year old who has ever had sex, you're going to say to all of them that it was a foolish mistake?  I know we're talking different circumstances here with bojack and his age, but are you honestly, for the sake of argument claiming that all pre 18 people who decide to have sex are all clueless and have no right to stand for what they want?  There may be a lot of people and characters who absolutely put themselves in dumb situations not knowing the consequences years later, some stupid then others.  Penny is not stupid."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,FvHound,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:44:07 2015 UTC,"His age and the power dynamic that comes with it are the relevant difference here. Of course I'm not denying that teenagers can make informed decisions about sex with partners of their own age, don't be dense. I've also never said that Penny is stupid, but nice try at winning rhetorical points.   Do you mean to suggest that you see nothing wrong with a 51 year old man purchasing hard liquor for teenagers; neglecting his responsibility to act as a guardian, which leads to one of the teenagers under his supervision getting alcohol poisoning; slow dancing with and making eyes at a 17 year old girl, when it ought to have been clear to him, as an adult, that his actions would foster emotional dependence in her; bullying another of the teens under his care into lying about his involvement; and finally, after denying her twice, allowing the very same 17 year old girl to join him on his bed and  undo his bowtie after she's made it extremely clear that she wants to sleep with him?  You are honestly prepared to endorse that chain of events?"
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Nabokchoy,4,Sun Jul 19 10:32:35 2015 UTC,"I wonder, personally, if Charlotte really did just walk in at the ""wrong"" time.  I suspect they might go back on that during the ""upswing"" next season, and have the kid come in, start to undo his shirt, and Charlotte walk in at that moment - while he's still waking up half-drunk and not really having had the chance to take stock of the situation.  Then, I think we'll get to see another layer - that Bojack would have asked her to leave if he'd had a minute or so longer, but when Charlotte turned up, he was that downtrodden and hurt by her reaction that he didn't even try to argue.  Basically, the whole trip back to LA involved him reflecting that he's become the kind of person that when Charlotte caught him with her daughter, Charlotte immediately assumed Bojack was up to no good and totally responsible.  Basically it bothers him that normally, she'd be right."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,Karetan,3,Sun Jul 19 10:40:54 2015 UTC,"I seriously think Bojack didn't do anything that bad that night. I think he went to prom with the kid to make her happy just because he actually likes Charlotte's family. He was as honest as he could with her all along telling her the real reason he went there. Even if he did give alcohol to teenagers, they were 17 and he was with them the whole time... He did bring her to the hospital afterall and did care about her safety : ""lock the wheels first"". He did not lie to the kids either. He gave the real reason nobody could know he was there. It would truly give nothing more except him getting arrested if he told the true story.  Then, from what I saw, it's Charlotte who kissed him after being super flirty.   He never had the intention to sleep with Penny. All he could say when talking about the balloons to Charlotte was : ""It was good memories right?"" He really wanted to give these kids the same experience he had at their age and at the same time relive the only moments which made him happy in his life."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,French__Canadian,2,Sun Jul 19 11:39:36 2015 UTC,"I don't totally buy the argument ""BoJack didn't do anything bad that night.""  I think it's stretching it to say that a grown man teaching teenagers over three decades younger than him how to get drunk more efficiently isn't bad.  Yeah, they were going to get wasted, but yeah... guy should have known better.  His freak out at the hospital?  I think that's his self-centeredness coming into play.  I don't think he was concerned for them... I think he was concerned for himself.    As to ""Charlotte kissed him.""  Okay, this isn't high school so who kissed who first isn't something I think that's as applicable as the fact that they both seemed to willingly participate.  Now, don't get me wrong, Charlotte committed a moral lapse with that one.  She's the married one and she'll have to take responsibility for that.  BoJack, however, responded by asking here to run away from her family.  He's not thinking about Charlotte as a person or the other individuals such an action would hurt, he's been invested in the idea that Charlotte can save him.  He likes the idea that she knew who he was before he started to really fuck up and that if she loves him it proves that he really is a good person, deep down.  Look, this is a television show and it's a pretty tightly scripted one.  So you have to ask yourself: ""Why are they showing BoJack helping the kids get drunk, why are they showing him at the hospital, why are they showing him try to steal Charlotte away, and why do we see him in a compromising position with Penny (door open or not).""  For me, the stronger motivation for showing him hang around teenagers isn't to see him connect with them and be a good person by helping them party harder, it's showing him spiral further to the bottom than you thought he could go.  His entire trip to New Mexico was him running away from responsibility and I think this episode did a pretty good job when, no matter what your age, you decide that you're not beholden to anything or anyone."
BoJackHorseman,3dqwtf,TomBombomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:27:07 2015 UTC,Let's be clear though. I said BoJack did not do anything THAT bad. Meaning he wasn't bad by BoJack standards (which are very very low). We're talking about the guy who would have made a hit and run when he ran over a deer when he was not in the wrong and could really easily pay for his hospital bills anyway. We're talking about the guy who slept with the drug addict in her 20's. He's the guy who threats the only persons who love him (Mr. PB and Tod) like shit.

I think she fooled herself into thinking Bojack was capable of change even though deep down she knows he can't. In season one she nonchalantly calls him a coward, and then in this current season with him being referred to as a tar pit shows she knows what he's really like. But it looks like he's changed, so she lets her guard down which is a mistake, and when he makes a move she realizes she was right all along about him. I think they're both partly to blame but I feel like Bojack takes the most of it."

It's probably mostly me projecting my own feelings on cheating, but I really wanted Charlotte to be a really, really actually good person, even though for most people that's unrealistic.  From the moment she sat next to him after getting up for that beer, it was obvious that she wanted him to kiss her. Sitting close, letting him hold her, and the kiss was 50/50 on both sides, and it took a while for her to break away. The BS about ""getting the wrong signal"" was exactly that. She went for it even more than he did.  She obviously has a loving husband. It was awful of her to kiss Bojack. BoJack is in the wrong too, but we're supposed to hate him to an extent. Charlotte was made out to be one of the few truly good people, above everything else, but her cheating on her husband kind of ruined that. I get that it's supposed to show that deep down everyone does bad things, but damn.   And I'm not saying I hate Charlotte. Good people do bad things. I just had this image of her as being one of the deep down, really, truly good people, but she does bad things like everybody else. It's not a problem with the show, it's just my feelings on it.  Anybody else feel really disappointed in her?"
BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,SaintDane01,-13,Tue Jul 21 10:06:51 2015 UTC,"Why did Charlotte wait that long to tell Bojack to leave?   Because he hadn't violated her marriage yet.   Even if he wasn't causing any major issues during that time, she had to realize that she was sending a bad message to him and to herself.   Or maybe she expected Bojack to behave like a responsible adult who wouldn't potentially wreck her home for selfish, impulsive reasons?    She snuggles up right next to Bojack and then all of a sudden they kiss and it's wrong.   Bingo. Which is why she tells him it's best if he leaves. Which Bojack won't accept, because he's a narcissist. She realizes it's a mistake, Bojack pushes her.     it's just not realistic or healthy given where she is with her life Bojack's personality.   Bojack would ruin her and her family.    Though I think what hurt the most was that she blamed Bojack, almost like how his mother always blamed him rather than herself.   Except that in this case, Bojack is unequivocally in the wrong. An old woman acquaintance* inviting you to spend time with her family does not also give you an open invitation to expect sex or intimacy. Inter-gender friendships do not necessarily progress to sex. Charlotte made a drunken mistake, immediately recanted, and asked for space. I don't see any way you can argue that she owes Bojack anything. I understand that you empathize with him, (only natural as he's the protagonist, and I should add that I feel for him, too), but the logic behind this post is the same entitled way of thinking about women and their obligations to men that motivate date rapists. That's bad company to keep, bro. Just saying.    It also bears repeating: a married acquaintance."

But what else was Bojack supposed to think by that point?  she encouraged him to think that there was something there.   The implication being that if a woman friend invites you to stay with her for an extended period of time, sex/a relationship is on the table. She was friendly with him, but never before the kiss that she immediately retracted did she give any indication that she had romantic feelings for Bojack. Snuggling isn't inherently a sexual activity— friends of all genders snuggle without the presumption of greater intimacy.  I wasn't trying to accuse you of anything, btw. It's just that a lot of guys think this way, (I did a few years ago, too), and it's an unhealthy attitude to have toward women."

BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,Nabokchoy,-2,Sun Jul 19 11:49:25 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand how this is controversial. A man whom she only knew superficially 30 years ago shows up at her home, and, having recently seen how broken he was at Herb's funeral, she decides to be kind and allow him to stay. He spends two months as a platonic member of her household, without even the slightest indication that he's there to ""win"" her from her husband, and she of course assumes he's an old friend in need of care and nothing more. There's a minor indiscretion, initiated by Bojack, which she immediately shuts down. He refuses to accept her refusal, asks her to leave her husband of 17+ years and her two children and run away with him, like a crazy person. Recognizing that Bojack is unstable and will only make things worse, she tells him to leave.   Now, where in that does Charlotte bear responsibility for Bojack's behavior? What would motivate y'all to shift blame off of the narcissist's shoulders and onto the responsible mother and wife's, unless it was the expectation that she owed Bojack... for what, exactly? For betraying her friend and sometime boyfriend? For dropping out of her life for 30 years? For ""leading him on"" by inviting him to stay? Bojack showed up to crash her life and use her to forget L.A. He was unequivocally the bad guy here. You can call it SRS bullshit if you want, but there's casual misogyny all over the assumptions in this thread and others.

BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,SaintDane01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"Have you ever been married? If I invited over someone of the opposite sex, and CLEARLY had some romantic/sexual tension with them, and stayed up late with them snuggling on a couch and drinking together while my spouse was asleep, they would be extremely suspicious and little upset, and they would have every right to be.  I think you're arguing against something that the poster isn't saying. There's a difference between ""She was sending a message"" and ""she owed him sex.""   The OP wasn't arguing that she was completely at fault or that Bojack was right in thinking that she owed him anything. Just that by crossing that line of appropriateness between friends when married, she was contributing to what happened.  If you and your friends cuddle with each other and there's absolutely ZERO sexual or romantic tension, then fine. But ask any older, married person, and 9 out of 10 of them will say that it's inappropriate."
BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,Nabokchoy,0,Tue Jul 21 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"1) I don't share the jealous proclivities that motivate people to consider snuggling a breach of trust. I don't care what level of commitment exists between partners, it just strikes me as very intrusive to proscribe laying a head on someone's shoulder, because there's nothing inherently sexual about that gesture. Ditto for talking and drinking together. People have every right to drink and talk with whomever they like without the presence of their spouse, especially when their marriage is healthy. Being suspicious because your wife talks with an old friend over beers and has physical contact with them is kind of crazy. I don't deny that people think this way. It's neither healthy nor warranted, is what I'm saying.  2) You did stipulate that there was a romantic tension between them, so let me address that. That Bojack was attracted to Charlotte is beyond doubt. That Charlotte was at one time attracted to Bojack seems plausible, too. That she is currently, at the time of the episode, attracted to Bojack, doesn't seem to be supported by much evidence. She has charisma with him because they get along well and share a history. But she's in a committed marriage and shows no sign up until the kiss that she is willing to compromise that marriage. Bojack used her friendly gesture as an opportunity to make up for the depressing conclusion of his night, and to continue the high of reliving his youth. She was wrong to accede to that kiss, and she immediately recants. Whatever message Bojack received was read into her behavior, not an inherent feature of her behavior. Which leads me to  3) Similar assumptions are being made by you and OP. These assumptions were the target of my post. Among them is the idea that two opposite gendered people can't have a charismatic relationship that isn't potentially romantic. Charlotte seemed to want to help an old friend. Bojack wanted to have Charlotte fix him with a romantic relationship. Any interpretation of events that blames Charlotte for leading Bohack on has bad assumptions about gender dynamics and relationship ethics built into its theory."

BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,boldred,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:29:36 2015 UTC,I hated the daughter-prom plot line. I feel that it goes completely against his character (taking care of his on stage family). Then to get the kids drunk and allow his friend's daughter inside the yacht really pisses me off.
BoJackHorseman,3dsr4u,Donktor_Jcon,10,Sun Jul 19 06:12:21 2015 UTC,"taking care of his on stage family   Well, in Season One, he blows cigarette smoke in Sarah's face and calls her rude for coughing during a Horsin' Around flashback, then fucks her and goes on a bender with her a couple of decades later, after telling her she needs to get her drug use in check. He even refers to his ""deep guilt over past neglect"" when Diane and Todd confront him about being complicit in her ruining his house.  I think Bojack wants to do better by the people in his life, but he's yet to set a precedent for actually doing so thus far."

BoJackHorseman,3dqeil,Nadel1232,79,Sat Jul 18 13:04:22 2015 UTC,Using it sparingly is the best thing they could do. The part with Charlotte was just so powerful and one of my favorite moments from the new season. Going from stealing a kiss from Charlotte to being told never to contact her or she'll fucking kill you is such a crazy transition and it makes so much sense.
BoJackHorseman,3dqeil,Aquaman_Forever,16,Sat Jul 18 14:45:21 2015 UTC,So true. Both moments were really poignant so it was great that the word was saved to give those moments more gravity.

BoJackHorseman,3dvi4v,kaxbe,5,Sun Jul 19 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing is inherently wrong with predictable. In regards to predictability in Bojack Horseman, though, I think it works because we know that Bojack Horseman will make the wrong decision, but it's always in the context of ""how"" and ""when"" since we know that Bojack knows he's messed up. In season 2 we know he wants to be better, but it's a question of can he actually be better and how long will he ""be better""."
BoJackHorseman,3dvi4v,kaxbe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think predictability is less of an issue in more episodic shows, where everything gets reset to the status quo  In a show with story arcs, like this one, it becomes a problem.  A multi-episode or multi-season story arc isn't that gripping if you can figure out what is going to happen"
BoJackHorseman,3dvi4v,Koalasonfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree here. I'm a firm believer in the idea that the story isn't as important as what you do with the story. It's why we can have so many zombie movies. The plot is almost always the same in a lot of them, but you can still do something with it to make it fresh. I think the same can be applied here. We know that Bojack struggles to be happy. The struggle to be happy is something that almost all the characters deal with. As an audience, we know that Bojack can't keep himself happy and ""better"" for long. We can accurately predict that each time he'll find a way to screw up a good thing he's got going, but it's a matter of how and when. Have you seen episode 11 yet? It's probably the best example."
BoJackHorseman,3dvi4v,capncrunch94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"But how interesting would it be to watch Bojack find new ways to fail?  It could work as a recurring joke...like Charlie Brown and the football.  But I don't think it works as well for a dramatic story arc.  For that I'd expect something new.  ""Well, Bojack screwed up again"" would get old for me fast.  I'm also wondering if it's also a matter of taste.  Perhaps for those who are really into the downer-type endings it doesn't seem as repetitive."

BoJackHorseman,3dqrkk,OctagonCosplay,18,Sat Jul 18 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"This is a great character bit, though I do think that Bojack and MPB's relationship is far more complex and harder to resolve than stealing a meal from Neal McBeil the Navy Seal.   I would have liked it if they dug more into the animosity between them, besides dropping ""you kissed my wife once!"" and leaving that at the center of the emotional conflict. But maybe it's better if they leave issues like MPB's House being a ripoff of Horsin' Around and other troubles between the characters unresolved? I don't know. It was such a great episode though."
BoJackHorseman,3dqrkk,CountedCrow,9,Sat Jul 18 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning behind it is that it shows how different Mr. Peanutbutter and Bojack are. MPB has every reason to hate Bojack and never speak to him again, but Mr. Peanutbutter is the type of guy who's just willing to forgive and forget. He doesn't hold onto the past and internalize it like Bojack does.   Spoiler  This kind of rambled on but hopefully you see where I'm coming from."

BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,wgewgwega,9,Sun Jul 19 10:14:18 2015 UTC,"It's weird that you have a problem with her flaws but not the much more fucked up character of Bojack. Of course he's explored more deeply, he's the lead character. She's flawed and goes through a lot this season but she's really not a chronically shitty person. She's depressed before the surprise party and the outburst is a symptom of that. Her exposing a rapist is noble because it did her no favors but she followed her conscience. Then her meltdown is her coping with the fact that she's more selfish and less capable as a journalist than she thought. It's all interesting to me and she is far from the worst person on the show."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,BbCortazan,-7,Sun Jul 19 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"Her exposing a rapist is noble because it did her no favors but she followed her conscience.   What did she expose? She had no relevant information that wasn't available to the general public- she wasn't providing anything, she was just piling on. I for one don't appreciate people who speak out on subjects they have no involvement in or information about simply based on emotional motivations.  I absolutely don't think she's the worst character in the show, at all. I just think that if we're supposed to see her as a sympathetic character, she should be forced to observe and answer for the consequences of her actions."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,BbCortazan,5,Sun Jul 19 20:33:32 2015 UTC,It's like Hannibal Buress and Bill Cosby. He didn't share anything that wasn't public knowledge either he just drew attention to it.   Also she got death threats which seems like a consequence to me.   Going from your comment history though it seems you just have a hard time empathizing with women.
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,BbCortazan,-4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"I don't appreciate what people are doing to Bill Cosby either.   Also she got death threats which seems like a consequence to me.   It's not the same. I don't want Diane to suffer, I want characters generally to have to face their flaws and be forced to grow and develope. Death threats are obviously not reasonable or fair- she can't grow as a character from being threatened and mistreated.   Going from your comment history though it seems you just have a hard time empathizing with women.    That's a ridiculous accusation and totally uncalled for. I think my committed and loving feminist partner would beg to differ."

I don't see Feminism as representing gender equality at all- in fact at this point I don't think it does very much to help even women.   The new label is male centric and often misogynistic.   And feminism isn't Female-centric? Where are the feminists campaigning for an end to selective service, circumcision, alimony, an improved child custody system, equal prison sentencing, an end to male disposability, an end to the overdiagnosis of ADHD in young boys, etc?

BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,PrinceOWales,19,Mon Jul 20 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see this at all. Diane is a talented author who has been demoted to housewife. Her intellectual work isn't appreciated by Mr. PB or Bojack, and unlike either of them, she has no major accomplishments to look back on fondly. (Even her book does more for Bojack's career than her own.) She's angry at Mr. PB because 1) he threw the party he would have wanted, Diane doesn't like parties, and TBH, it's smothering to have so many successive gifts thrown at you with the expectation that you'll be grateful and return the kindnesses with an excess of kindness; 2) because Mr. PB expected her to value him above her own career interests (Cordovia), as the dialogue makes clear. Notice that they both forgive one another after compromising: PB is cool with Diane seeking new and challenging opportunities, Diane is cool with PB staying just as he is. Like, honestly, this is the healthiest, most gender balanced (and most realistic) relationship we've gotten in a sitcom for some time, and Diane is a very intelligent, fully fleshed out woman. But nah, let's see her PUNISHED.   *Edit: Also, before the inevitable mention of the lost months at Bojack's, keep in mind that she directly experienced the murder of a child whom she bonded with, among others, discovered that an honored philanthropist was really a self-absorbed glutton for praise, and that she didn't have the constitution to persevere through all the death. That's some traumatic shit. And Mr. PB forgave her, because, what do you know, he's an understanding, loving partner. How novel."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,Nabokchoy,-3,Sun Jul 19 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"I could understand Diane being upset at Mr. PB for throwing her a party even though she doesn't like parties, but that absolutely does not excuse her screaming at him in front of a room full of their friends. I would never tolerate behavior like that from a romantic partner, and I would be deeply concerned about anyone who would. You're god damn right I want to see her punished, because it's absolutely unbelievable that someone could prance through life treating her friends the way she does without ever getting called on the mat for it. The whole story is about BoJack coming to terms with and taking responsibility for the way his actions have harmed himself and others- but Diane never seems to have to face any real consequences. And you think her relationship with Mr. Peanut Butter is healthy and realistic? Give me a fucking break. PB is a god damn cereal mascot, if not an absolute headcase- every joke about his character is based on the fact that no person could possibly be the way he is."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,Garlic_Helix,9,Sun Jul 19 06:59:06 2015 UTC,"absolutely does not excuse her screaming at him in front of a room full of their friends   She apologized. And PB forgave her. The fact that you want to see her punished over and above her having acknowledged that she behaved poorly is concerning.    I would be deeply concerned about anyone who would   If it were habitual, sure. This was a one-off occurrence. If you would have made her beg or demanded further restitution, than you are the one with hangups, mate.    because it's absolutely unbelievable that someone could prance through life treating her friends the way she does without ever getting called on the mat for it.   Wait, what? When has Diane been really shitty? She helps Todd save Beckah, is a loving partner to PB except for one fight, supports Bojack despite how terribly he has mistreated her, going so far as to apologize to him for having hurt his feelings by publishing the book without redaction, and consoles him after his breakup with Wanda... How exactly has she been really selfish?   The whole story is about BoJack coming to terms with and taking responsibility for the way his actions have harmed himself and others-   The show is mostly about Bojack failing to accept responsibility for his actions. He's trying, but not hard enough. And let's be absolutely clear— Diane has done nothing comparable to Bojack's destructive behavior. Nada. Zip.    And you think her relationship with Mr. Peanut Butter is healthy and realistic?   Healthy: honest communication, including when they're upset with one another; mutual respect, albeit still a work in progress as Diane grows into second-stage adulthood and PB adjusts to her changing needs; ability to fight and then forgive one another without ignoring the causes or gaslighting; stable, independent lives which they share with one another...  Realistic: All of the above, together with their misunderstandings, different needs, and clashes of personality. Yeah, PB is played for jokes, (mainly having to do with his dog half), but PB's arc this season was about exploring how personalities without chronic depression are still capable of having neuroses, and feeling sad or afraid.   Honestly dude, it says a lot about you and the other commenters who agree with you that you think Diane is selfish to the point of deserving punishment when such an interpretation isn't warranted by her presentation. Fucked up."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,GeauxTiger,4,Sun Jul 19 07:15:35 2015 UTC,"Healthy and Realistic   Seriously this. It is incredibly rare to see this kind of relationship on tv. Diane isn't just some domineering careerist or doormat housewife and MPB isn't some father-knows-best or hen pecked husband. They both have their troubles that come through but because they love each other, they are able to compromise and forgive each other.   That's what makes this show so good. An absurdest comedy that still manages to keep it's characters human."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,Nabokchoy,-9,Sun Jul 19 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"She apologized. And PB forgave her. The fact that you want to see her punished over and above her having acknowledged that she acted out of line is concerning.   I want to see characters realize their flaws and overcome them, something that cannot happen if they aren't forced to deal with the consequences of their actions.    If it were habitual, sure. This was a one-off occurrence. If you would have made her beg or demanded further restitution, than you are the one with hangups, mate.   What the fuck are you talking about? Do you have some of kind of problem with people respecting themselves? I don't appreciate what you're implying here. No, I would not roll over like a fucking doormat the way PB did, sorry if that makes me a tool in your eyes.  It's not one incident I'm referring to, anyway. What about season 2, episode 7, where she puts her own self-righteous political agenda against every other protagonist and makes accusations on a national stage against a third party about events she had nothing to do with and knew practically nothing about? She is a chronically self-righteous and self-important person. That doesn't mean I think what she does is morally worse than what Bojack does- but whereas Bojack is displayed as a broken character who is at least ostensibly trying to face the consequences of his actions and the flaws within himself, Diane consistently puts herself (and is put) in the position of the judge.    Honestly dude, it says a lot about you and the other commenters who agree with you that you think Diane is selfish to the point of deserving punishment when such an interpretation isn't warranted by her presentation. Fucked up.   You're quite like Diane in that you feel entitled to judge me and the other people here, don't you think? What a fucking infant you are. You totally, completely, absolutely do not understand what the fuck I mean when I use the word ""punishment"" do you? It's not some fucking masturbatory moral play, it's the fact that I appreciate stories where characters are forced to fucking grow. Diane is not forced to grow, her flaws are catered to as if she is a fucking child.  I do not have the fucking time for self-righteous fucktards who are going to insinuate things about me and other people based on our opinions of a character in a fucking animated comedy show. Tagged as ""Judgmental BoJack Cunt"" and /disable inbox replies. I hope you have a shitty fucking day so, unlike Diane, maybe you'll grow and develop as a person."
BoJackHorseman,3dt6mq,GeauxTiger,7,Sun Jul 19 08:18:14 2015 UTC,"I want to see characters realize their flaws and overcome them   Adults do this by asking forgiveness and working together.

No. I have a problem with emotional incontinence.   where she puts her own self-righteous political agenda against every other protagonist and makes accusations on a national stage against a third party about events she had nothing to do with and knew practically nothing about? She is a chronically self-righteous and self-important person.   Excuse me? Are you referring to the episode where a courageous woman stands up for a half-dozen others who were raped by an unassailable male authority? Is it selfish to lobby for justice in the face of death threats? Is it self-important to oppose ignorance and violence without regard to one's safety? Were the members of SNCC who marched at Selma self-righteous?    Diane consistently puts herself (and is put) in the position of the judge.

Language can be used figuratively.    she went from the book to a consultant sign-writer on the movie to cordovia Sebastian St. Clare's PR tool.   FTFY   how exactly are you defining ""housewife""   A wife who doesn't have a career of her own?    bojack clearly respects her which is why hes so desperate for her approval   Nope. Bojack was attracted to her, then became her friend. The only time she's talked with him about her intellectual work, he's said ""Uhhhhhh..."" and the show moved on. (Season 1, in BJ's office). Every time he's discussed her book, he's complained that she didn't write a depthless fluff-piece.   MPB brags about her constantly, even telling one of the stagehands how much better she is compared to his wife.   For her philanthropic venture in Cordovia. Not for her writing. PB is a good guy, so he takes her to the contemporary art panel, but he doesn't engage with it. There's a difference between being supported by your spouse and being stimulated by them. Diane isn't intellectually stimulated by either of the men in her life, (except Bojack, but only when observing him as a subject to write about.)   she has two best selling books, one that was turned into a movie.   The first of which was ghostwritten, the second of which helped Bojack's career but did nothing to further hers. Hence why she gets a shit, unimportant job on the Secretariat movie. I'm going to assume you have no experience with the publishing industry? Ghostwriters are the lowest on the totem pole. It's the improv of writing. Recognition or restitution not forthcoming.    ""evil men"" agenda here   Nope. I've said a dozen times ITT that Diane and PB's marriage is healthy, and that it's refreshing to see a gender-balanced couple on TV. I'm merely responding to the casual misogyny of /u/Scimitar66 and others here. Not surprising. This is Reddit after all.

BoJackHorseman,3ds8tc,veryimprobable,4,Sun Jul 19 00:04:48 2015 UTC,Sextina is probably a joke about Christina Aguilera because in the early 2000's she went by X-Tina for a while.

And I actually always assumed Sextina was just there to represent ""modern"" pop culture as a whole, without drawing ties to any specific celebrity.

Earlier in the episode, Bojack tells Penny that she looks just like her mother. Him finally giving in to Penny a result of him desperately wanting that connection with Charlotte, and accepting the physical aspect that Penny is offering because he's not in the best mind space."

This episode served a very specific purpose in reminding us that he has become a monster and he is complicit in his actions and their consequences.    Normally we watch him hurting people as a result of his depression, and we can sympathize despite that flaw because depression results in a certain volatile apathy. This isn't him hurting people because he's depressed though. This is him hurting people because he's desperate to achieve his own happiness regardless of who gets hurt in the process.    Both this episode and the Herb Kazzaz episode involve him trying to use the people from his past to fix himself. Regardless of how they actually feel about him or how he has treated them. The crux of these specific actions is not depression but instead narcissism. As such, they are far more malicious than his usual acts of lashing out, even if his words tend to be far more honeyed during these moments."

I will make a lot of bad decisions that will hurt people just to pursue something short sighted because I am afraid of not having anything at all. Bojack's self-aware sadness really bites into our long held belief in the possibility of pursuit of happiness with some intangible end in sight. I think depending on our approach some enjoy the pursuit, and find happiness in the pursuit themselves (kind of an existentialist approach), and maybe Bojack needs to find himself there, but for a lot of us I think the path is riddled with detours and back tracking, and we will burn a lot of bridges and there is often no closure sometimes, and probably most painfully, we will turn our back on others who care."
BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,Mongoose42,5,Sat Jul 18 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"Totally. When SPOILER Bojack told PB he envied him because he feels good about himself I just lost it. I cried like a fucking baby. That's what bojack's mum was talking about, that void that can't be filled by projects or girlfriends or anything.   It's insane that I can relate so much to a depressive anthropomorphic horse."
BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,CountedCrow,5,Sat Jul 18 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"I think I see a lot of myself in Princess Caroline. I think I do try to help others a lot when my own life in a wreck. And especially in the last episode where she admits she's not afraid of being alone. Because of how I can never seem to hold down a relationship, and I find myself single a lot, that's actually really comforting. I aspire to be more like that."
BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,Fembotty,5,Sat Jul 18 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"I see a bit of myself in him. I'm habitually sarcastic, a bit of a funny guy, and I have a bad tendency to push my friends away without realizing how or why.   Sometimes when I watch this show, Bojack starts asking what he's doing with his life and I follow suit, and then I tell myself I haven't done half the bad things Bojack has. I've never fought with a cancer patient over a treasured telescope, almost screwed my estranged friend's daughter, or sabotaged someone's artistic work, but does that mean I'm a better person, or that I just haven't done my bad stuff yet. That's why he's such a scary protagonist for me.    I haven't been to the dark places he's been, but he represents the bad person I could become."
BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,The_Iron_Zeppelin,5,Sat Jul 18 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's probably a bad thing if you see yourself too much in Bojack. I got my best friend and ex boyfriend to watch the show because he was exactly the same as Bojack in nearly every way and he had turned me into Princess Carolyn. He was short sighted, drug/alcohol abusing, insensitive, ranted a lot, had no problems holding people down so they wouldn't leave him, etc. And I'm bitchier, still have weird on and off again things with him, and sometimes get consumed by my pursuit of a fulfilled life and career.  We honestly sat down and listed everyone in each other's lives that fit the characters haha. Also Hank Hippo is Bill Cosby."

BoJack has a certain level of fragility in his character that is tucked behind all his self pity, cynicism, and grandeur. I think my major attachment to the show is that he's so relatable in certain aspects that hit home with the viewers.   And it doesn't help that he says these deep things that I enjoy quoting all the time because it resonates with me and my existentialistic crisis."

Bojack at least has his career to go off, Todd falls from situation to situation trying to find a bit of meaning, hell trying to find a bit of compassion he's deep enough to realise it but he plays the fool anyway because, well thats what Bojack needs sometimes, and sometimes it's what Todd needs. because it's much easier to play the happy idiot like Todd than it is to try to deal with it head on like BJ. Or maybe that's just what I see of myself in Todd."
BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,thenewtbaron,2,Sun Jul 19 01:07:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like a mix of mostly Bojack and Diane.   Some times I feel lost, directionless and afraid I'll wake up in 30 years having never done anything worthwhile.  Those are some pretty common fears though, which is why the show has such an impact with so many people."

BoJackHorseman,3dqcnl,HidingInTheWardrobe,2,Sat Jul 18 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who wanted to be an actor, this show really spoke to me. I wanted to be famous and make a lot of money, and seeing Bojack's unhappiness made me realize that money and fame wouldn't make me happier. This show has taught me a lot about life and has made me reevaluate my priorities."

BoJackHorseman,3dsejc,GeauxTiger,5,Sun Jul 19 00:50:35 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to bet the Secretariat movie will be a hit, just like his book, and he might end up with an Oscar for it. Despite that BoJack didn't really act in it, it'll follow a similar theme of his book which he didn't write either.   His celebrity will most likely increase and he'll go to New York to do that play. The change in setting will be cool as we can see how New York looks like in BoJack universe, I can already imagine the pigeon and rat gags that will surely be made.  By the end of it I could see Bojack being like an A-List celebrity and just having to deal with all the added pressures of being a ever-scrutinized celebrity instead of just a joke has-been. Also we'll probably find out about the 'other' show he was in and hopefully see Wanda again! I loved Lisa Kudrow's work this season!  As for everyone else, I think MPB and Diane might have kids. I also think Todd's backstory and character will be more deeply explored kinda like they did MPB this season  EDIT: willing to bet there'll be at least one episode focused on politics as it'll be released only a few months before the 2016 election. I'm very much looking forward to their satirical take of the political process in bojack-world."
BoJackHorseman,3dsejc,WitnShit,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that BoJack will come back into the limelight, that he will go the New York to do the play and he will become some sort of A-List or rekindled star.  My own theory is that he will start to drown out all his feelings about what happened with  in the love and adoration of his new fans, and maybe go back to being similar to how he was at the beginning of season 1 or during the later years of Horsin' Around.   Then something surfaces about him . His fans all turn on him and sit his problems right out in the open where there is nowhere he can hide from them, effectively Bringing him back down to Earth and into his depressing life, furthered by no longer having the distraction of people giving him praise and loving him. Also, it is the only way I could see  coming back into BoJack's Life, and it's hard to see them completely getting rid of that character.   There could be a trial or something, his close friends are given a new perspective on how destructive BoJacks personallity really is, and other terribly awesome things that will leave you feeling empty inside and thinking about it for days after that feeling disipates.  It also leaves room for the first half of the season to delve more into the other characters' themes and stories, while BoJack is off doing ""less"" plot important things and really bringing himself into the public eye. (This seems to be the format that the seasons use, developing for the first half and really knuckling down for the second half)  But, Honestly, there are so many different directions that this show could go and still pull from everthing that has happened so far, I wouldn't be too surprised if no one guessesexactly; and the writing staff is so good I think just about whatever they do will turn out great!"

Because it seems like there were many more backgrounds, props, and characters (main and background) than the last season. Everything seemed a lot busier and much more alive.  And also the animation looked a lot smoother. More frames this season?"
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,spoonerism_,3,Sat Jul 18 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"I wasn't on for season one, so I can't say for certain, but I don't think we had any more time this time around. I think we were definitely more ambitious with this season in terms of adding characters and content. But it's our second time around, so we were much more finessed and streamlined! Long story short: hard work, blood, sweat, and tears (okay, probably no blood)!"
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,Mojavesunset,2,Sat Jul 18 06:11:49 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I loved every minute of Season 2. Please keep doing what you're doing for Season 3. Your ock!
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,The_R4ke,6,Sat Jul 18 02:17:59 2015 UTC,What about my ock?!
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,MisterTruth,3,Sat Jul 18 04:59:31 2015 UTC,It's yours and no one else's!
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,Ledhammer,2,Sat Jul 18 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take your word and believe that you are involved in the production of the show.   Brilliant job with Season 2.  I hope there is more in store for this heroic horse-stud, who is awesome, and who can save us from our flawed sad lives. ;)"
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,rowaway696969,2,Sat Jul 18 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"You guys NAILED it with the premiere. I loved it.  Gonna continue binging and loving all the inside jokes. Although, as a former assistant in Hollywood, your assistant joke killed me."
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,capitolprostitute,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:35 2015 UTC,This show is really well written. Strange as it is I am more invested in the Vincent side plot than any other TV show ever.

BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,HidingInTheWardrobe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:56:54 2015 UTC,I want to know how he could lie to PC about having a son. That's a big thing in life.
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,terrotifying,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:20:00 2015 UTC,"When you're three children in a trenchcoat I'm pretty sure your moral compass is a bit skewed.   Edit: Alright I figured I should expand on this, Vincent is nothing more than a comic fold and a plot device for PC's series of failed relationships. She a career-oriented women, whose love is fast life of being a Hollywood agent, but she sucks at finding interesting and good men to date, partly because of her age she worried about not having a family and children. The fact that she was attracted to the Vincent in the first place was to get over her past lover Bojack, because he's the self-stabaging asshole we root for. It was just a fun gag that they ran with.   What, in your relationships, you never looked past a bunch of red flags, just so you could get over someone?"
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,buttholemuffin,2,Sat Jul 18 21:34:40 2015 UTC,Will season 3 have BoJack be elected president?
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,buttholemuffin,2,Sun Jul 19 04:29:32 2015 UTC,AMAZING show and an amazing season - thanks for being a part of it. :)
BoJackHorseman,3dnyvj,darkrage6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"I'm deciding to either binge watch or blowing stuff off, but I have to say thanks for an awesome experience. I never thought I could relate to a bunch of animal people. It's good television and I can't wait for the next season."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,KeifHaring,19,Sat Jul 18 14:07:24 2015 UTC,"Also, Ricky Gervais voiced the hedgehog in charge of the Jerb Kazzazz Orphanage."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,scriken,3,Sat Jul 18 18:48:36 2015 UTC,I was delighted he was there.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,NotEtreo,12,Sat Jul 18 23:09:26 2015 UTC,Paul McCartney and Daniel Radcliffe are the only ones I can think of off the top of my head
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,NotEtreo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:06 2015 UTC,Also Sarah Koenig
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,NozzleTheClown,8,Sat Jul 18 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"Jake Johnson was the Meerkat accountant, Joel McHale was the Soviet spy, Ed Helms was Charlotte's husband, and that horse from Horsin' Around played Bojack Horseman.  Edit: Chris Parnell to Ed Helms"
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,ImNextToABlackGuy,9,Sat Jul 18 19:34:49 2015 UTC,Ed helms was charlotte's husband

BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,ImNextToABlackGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:12 2015 UTC,oh you
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,ArcticGamer,7,Sat Jul 18 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"Jason Beghe voiced the jogging Babboonman, which I thought was a pretty brilliant Californication reference. Bojack and Hank Moody (David Duchovny) share a lot of similarities (though Bojack is a far better character since he doesn't have to look cool all the time), and Jason Beghe plays a writer on Californication that's basically a much better version of Hank's character, so I thought it apt to have him appear in this show as someone who understands life more than Bojack."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,scriken,4,Sat Jul 18 18:45:50 2015 UTC,"That is really cool, thanks for the connection."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,jesus_fn_christ,6,Sat Jul 18 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have a comprehensive list, but Rian Johnson, the director of Brick, Looper, and the upcoming Star Wars episode VIII, did the guy Brian, from the improv troupe.  I want to know which character Hannah Hooper (one of the members of Grouplove, who do the closing credits song) voiced."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,youprobablydontcare,11,Sat Jul 18 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"Also, Amy Schumer was Irving Jannings, the director's daughter. Tatiana Maslany voiced Mia McKabb, the mouse working on the game show. Alan Arkin killed it as JD Salinger. Ben Schwartz was Rutabaga Rabbitowitz."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,youprobablydontcare,3,Sat Jul 18 18:05:06 2015 UTC,thank you! i was going crazy trying to figure out Rutabaga.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,spaceball_ricochet,2,Sat Jul 18 21:49:23 2015 UTC,Definitely a little John Ralphio in Rutabaga.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,MisterTruth,4,Sat Jul 18 23:59:27 2015 UTC,Henry Winkler and Ed Helms was Charlotte's Husband.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,The_CRZA,3,Sat Jul 18 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"I know Joel Mchale was in the credits for the second episode, I'm assuming he was the guy from the 30 year coma that Wanda/Bojack met?"
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,iinfinityx2,3,Sat Jul 18 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"Ilana Glazer of Broad City voiced Penny, Charlotte's daughter."
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,rebelbydesign,3,Sat Jul 18 18:39:21 2015 UTC,Philip Baker Hall was Hank Hippopolis.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,ABandApart,2,Sat Jul 18 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"I thought guest performer wise, Hank was absolutely perfect casting. Considering Hall played a game show host with sexual allegations in Magnolia!"
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,MrJumbo,3,Sat Jul 18 22:13:25 2015 UTC,Anyone know who John Cho and Lake Bell voiced?
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,Cannonball_Z,2,Sat Jul 18 23:19:59 2015 UTC,Aisha Tyler had a guest spot as one of the security guards on the GiggleCruise.
BoJackHorseman,3dqjnl,Stillwater215,4,Sun Jul 19 07:09:33 2015 UTC,Aisha Taylor did the voice of Sextina Aquafina.
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,100MPHFastball,5,Sat Jul 18 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"I think Still Broken and After Party were the funniest, but then you get to Escape from LA and the show just warps.  To go from Charlotte's imaginary life in season 1, to her real life in season 2 was heart breaking enough, but as a contrast to some of the earlier episodes, this is a whole other show."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,27th_wonder,4,Sun Jul 19 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I really, really liked Chickens. Most of the critics hated it, and I don't understand why."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,NotEtreo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"Wait, where are you reading that. I believe you I would like to read what they are saying."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,wolf581,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"One aimless caper sees Bojack's roommate Todd (Aaron Paul, as the least interesting iteration of Jesse Pinkman yet) attempt to rescue an escaped chicken that is destined for a slaughterhouse. (She's named ""Becca,"" which sounds like ""ba-gok,"" get it?) The chicken's predicament as a food object plays on the show's ambiguous cohabitation of animals and humans, but it lacks any kind of character motivation and consumes nearly an entire episode.   Possibly the shittest interpretation of a TV show to date."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,NotEtreo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:28:15 2015 UTC,Ya I don't agree with that review at all.
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,wolf581,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Escape from L.A. was just a great episode of TV, but so hard to watch it may not be my favorite, but it's phenomenal."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,wolf581,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:51 2015 UTC,"Gotta be Escape From L.A.   Finally catching up with Charlotte, and the emotional rollercoaster, and the really great comedic moments made a truly excellent episode."
BoJackHorseman,3ds4ed,NoahRatcl,2,Sun Jul 19 01:53:13 2015 UTC,Either Escape from L.A. or Let's Find Out

BoJackHorseman,3dq6mj,Binary97,24,Sat Jul 18 11:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yep. Wanda turns up at some point in the season, the D from the Hollywood sign disappears in Series 1. I think the burnt ottoman is in the series 1 intro too.   The sequence evolves to reflect the realities of the show. It's another example of the actions in the Bojack world having serious, lasting consequences."
BoJackHorseman,3dq6mj,NotEtreo,7,Sat Jul 18 13:58:26 2015 UTC,"Wanda also then stops being in the intro.  Also I noticed that when she did appear in the intro, she goes out on the porch and flies away.  I was wondering if that was foreshadowing and then..."
BoJackHorseman,3dq6mj,DekKato,9,Sun Jul 19 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"After episode 6, Corduroy Jackson Jackson isn't in the opening sequence either."

BoJackHorseman,3dq6mj,Parsath,3,Sun Jul 19 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was in the background of the movie set getting hair/makeup done. After he dies, he's gone but the makeup artist isn't. She actually raises her hands like she's about to start working on someone and then just stops and hangs her head. It's pretty sad."

I can empathize with a lot of his decisions, including his desire to fix himself and the mentality that it requires someone to repair him somehow.

I always wished I could see myself from an outside perspective to see what I am obviously fucking up in my life. Maybe you can think about some of the things you do as if bojack did it so you can think about it from an outside perspective and stop fucking things up for yourself. Not a pep talk or messing with you, im a shitty person too, just putting it out there. But then again I dont know what would help bojack be happy anyways to be honest."
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,Andh0w,24,Sat Jul 18 03:45:32 2015 UTC,"Despite the harsh ending, I hope they don't throw away that set of characters.  I can kind of see Penny running away to LA in the 3rd season and showing up at Bojack's door, and shenanigans ensuing thenceforth."
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,nocbl2,19,Sat Jul 18 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"They can't just abandon that whole thing, I really hope not.

The fallout that will ensue from that I am NOT ready for. I am pretty sure Charlotte will show up in his driveway with a baseball bat."
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,Sherbniz,3,Sat Jul 18 12:43:55 2015 UTC,I'd be crushed if he hooked up with Penny. Its Pervy. Everything bojack does I can explain and moralize that he's a wounded man. But banging his exfriends kid as either some place holder for her or as revenge would be too much.
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,nocbl2,4,Sat Jul 18 16:23:30 2015 UTC,I don't mean in a sexual way (hopefully).
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,Obskulum,21,Sat Jul 18 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"Charlotte was probably the realest of any relations Bojack had. And there was something clearly there, but. I dunno, too little, too late. Worse yet, though the idyllic painting of the life he imagined with her in Maine wasn't accurate, it was still right in the sense he probably would've had a fulfilling relationship should he have gone with her.  Ugh, the more you think on it the worse it gets. They had natural chemistry. They made each other happier. But depression is a terrible tar pit."
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,NateFalken,13,Sat Jul 18 06:50:38 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to capture just how distant 30 years can be with TV episodes that are 20 minutes long. I'd look to the movie UP to understand how long a lifetime is with only a few minutes of screen time but as you say, too little too late indeed.  Charlotte certainly wasn't portrayed as being in her late 40's, I mean common she looks like a hot 28 year old cartoon female deer! But after not seeing someone for over 30 years since high school that's the age she and Bojack would be.  I've moved towns, dated people out of country and so there's some people that I run into now and again who I haven't seen in over 5-10 years. I'm only 21 but one year I started chatting with an old girlfriend of mine who I hadn't seen in 5 or 6 years and we ending up meeting up again and each of us driving 3-4 hours to meet halfway. So much has changed and it's only been 5 years, I can't imagine what 30 years would be like!"
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,Docey,8,Sat Jul 18 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"I do not think so and that is one of the things about depression they got right in the show. Bojack thinks Charlotte knows him but in reality she doesn't.   She has not talked to him in 30 years, we look at the show in Bojack's lens though. He has no real connection with anybody so he is desperate to find anyone who he feels like he can connect. This is a very nice display of attachment issues done within the show."
BoJackHorseman,3dpb6r,Stillwater215,3,Sat Jul 18 12:25:35 2015 UTC,"But that's one of the defining themes of the show: That people rarely, if ever, will get a happily-ever-after. Bojack had his chance 30 years ago and missed it because of a choice that he made. Any idea that he had that she would wait around for him and not move on with her life is absurd. Charlotte said it best: ""We knew each other for five minutes thirty years ago."""

BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,MrJumbo,30,Fri Jul 17 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite use of imagery in the show ever. Herb is all exited about the future ""The future is bright, just look at it."" but he is pointing to a facade. Does this mean Herb was delusional and Bojack is right to hate the non-genuine future or is Bojack just super cynical and can't be optimistic at all? And even while drinking Squirt!?"
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,MrEdman4,12,Fri Jul 17 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"Either way they're both blinding themselves to the reality of the sunset. One's scared, one's not, but they're both heading the same direction."
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,ndyjones,10,Sat Jul 18 02:08:46 2015 UTC,There really seems to be a lot of symbolism that I didn't catch. Well I guess I have a job during the second binge
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,Waringham,15,Fri Jul 17 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"""the future is bright"" is what herb says, and then points to the billboard so as to use it as a metaphor for the future. but, the billboard is just that, a billboard, and as a result it is just a fake depiction. so, the future is just all fake, since life has no actual meaning, so anything we ascribe to it is fake, such as the future.  at least, this is what i got. i think in this manner all the time (clinically depressed lol) so maybe im just seeing it through my lens, but thats what i got out of it"
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,jpthehp,12,Sat Jul 18 01:03:25 2015 UTC,There is no shame in dying for nothing. It's why most people die.
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,ndyjones,3,Sat Jul 18 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"it's not about shame, it's about emptiness   edit for stoned typo"
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,jpthehp,2,Sat Jul 18 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"Good comment.  For me the billboard, just a hollywood prop for a movie, is very real but what it symbolizes is, as you put, is a fake depiction of the future. BoJack and Herb, two very real people, symbolize that the future is unforgiving, but very real.  I want to ponder on this longer to offer more insight."
BoJackHorseman,3dnw3m,goldenlabruffle,6,Sat Jul 18 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"This scene.  I think it goes beyond the troubles of their immediate future, or the empty meaning of Hollywood life.    Most of us act like our whole lives are ahead of us, like this is a dress rehearsal, when in fact every day is a day closer to death that we'll never get back.  This is a recurring theme in the show.  ""Take care of orphans later, there's always later!"" Princess Carolyn tells Diane, for example, stressing the last bit of her sentence.  This scene embodies that sentiment perfectly. Herb - who we know has died tragically young - looks to the backdrop and proclaims how bright the future is. The artificially blue sky obscures reality, the sunset looming in the background. The backdrop is the veil we throw over the truth - that death is closer than we acknowledge, that there isn't always later."
BoJackHorseman,3doya2,FatherMagoo,23,Sat Jul 18 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"Its a nice balance of funny, catchy and oddly sad."

BoJackHorseman,3doya2,agreatcynic,14,Sat Jul 18 04:10:36 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, it was stuck in my head when I finished season one just over a year ago and it stayed for a majority of the time for the hiatus between season two and its still here hours after finishing season two, its just so damn catchy."

BoJackHorseman,3doya2,Oregano69,7,Sat Jul 18 05:56:45 2015 UTC,"I just love the way that Bojack's ending theme can mean something different at the end of every episode. After the first few episodes of Season 1, it was just a catchy little tune that got stuck in my head. But then the episode where Bojack kissed Diane made it oddly sad. With the little strums happening as Bojack looks at the water, and then cutting to black as the first actual strum of the theme happens. And after ""Downer Ending"", the theme made me cry. I was on the verge as Bojack was talking to Diane... But something about the singer's voice sounded so desperate and sad, and I hadn't noticed before.   The first episode of Season 2 reminded me how sad the song can be, but since most of the episodes of Season 2 were light hearted (at least in my opinion), I started thinking of the song as catchy and fun again.  It's definitely the best ending theme I've ever heard."

It wouldn't surprise me if given that information, it turns out her father sexually abused her, and she clung to BoJack because he played a model father in the show."
BoJackHorseman,3do8px,W3asl3y,18,Fri Jul 17 22:36:36 2015 UTC,...and they had sex. yikes
BoJackHorseman,3do8px,jpthehp,23,Sat Jul 18 05:45:30 2015 UTC,"As soon as I realised she'd been abused by her stepfather I did a double-take. Even after we plumbed the depths of last season, I wasn't expecting us to go there.   I'm glad we did, though. It was handled well, very powerful and deeply sobering. This is a tragic world, and though we've had Bojack's perspective on things this season makes it immensely clear that everyone else is as broken and pained as our curmudgeonly hero."
BoJackHorseman,3do8px,NotEtreo,44,Fri Jul 17 22:53:44 2015 UTC,Wait so her step dad is Pedobear?

BoJackHorseman,3do8px,CitizenKing,16,Sat Jul 18 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I knew the moment she mentioned her step-dad was a photographer were they were going. When she mentions that she knows what bear fur tastes like because her step-dad was a bear I did a genuine spit-take. I couldn't believe they went there. It was at the same time the most harrowing moment I have seen in an animated show, and perhaps one of the funniest, most subtle jokes ever. I had to laugh because the alternative was crying."
BoJackHorseman,3do8px,TehDingo,3,Sat Jul 18 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same exact thing! Idk about the shirt, but the Step Dad being a photographer and the bear tasting was pretty big hints."

BoJackHorseman,3do8px,NotEtreo,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. I'm only skeptical because you cite her shirt as evidence but I've seen plenty of girls wearing stupid shit like that to get attention. Same with her drug use, she abuses drugs, sure, but she also announces that she's just super high right now and doesn't even know what's happening.  She might have been abused but I'd need more evidence, but if it turns out true then I'm impressed. I never even considered anything like that.  Just thinking now, you could probably cite that she fucked Bojack, a literal father figure, and seems to have just forgotten about it."
BoJackHorseman,3do8px,MrEdman4,6,Sat Jul 18 00:03:53 2015 UTC,I completely forgot about that. A repeat of past events and behavior perhaps ?

The fact that as a child, she brought up that her step father was a photographer with a look of pain on her face convinced me. Then when she knew the taste of bear fur, it became pretty obvious that she was sexually abused."

The punchline is the connection to the mulch-man joke that happened earlier in the episode   The boyfriend story was going to a really dark place and the bag of mulch is out of place.

Salinger in it though, through both seasons I kept drawing parallels between Holden and Bojack.

A lot more about ""Happiness"" too."
BoJackHorseman,3dm4lw,MrEdman4,8,Fri Jul 17 12:19:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it was a good thing that it ended on a happy note. I mean ultimately it would just be pointless stagnation to end on the same point as last season. I mean Bojack thought at the beginning of season 2 that he had it all worked out, inspirational crap, and a new attitude that didn't really mean jack shit, and it was that kind of pretense that looped him right back to the same shit he had been doing that kept fucking his life up.   Eventually he has to learn, and I think he did, to some extent. Yeah it's not going to be the miraculous shift he thought he had at the beginning of the season #bojackthoughts and he has a long way to go but if he works at it everyday I think he can change, and maybe that's a good thing, not only for him but for the show. Like Diane, it might not be able to just be one thing and never change."
