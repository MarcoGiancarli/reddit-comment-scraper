I wouldn't say I wanted poker to be long term but I thought doing it for a few years would buy me some time to get interested in something else instead of getting stuck in a deadend mcjob that would suck the life out of me. I had a few aha moments in march 2011 and suddenly was crushing 25nl like I was playing with children. I railed the 100nl games and realized the same exact fish were playing at those stakes and all I had to do was not get raped by the regs to eek out a profit. The day before black friday I took a shot at 50nl and it went great, won 3 buy ins and felt I was on my way.  As to what happened after... well... I decided it was time to finally grow up and quit acting like a child so I started selling drugs."

He said he joined the military and was in Iraq and he randomly remembered my email. He said I was right, his life had changed, he was a different person and it was time to do the right thing. He would contact me when he got back home.  Awhile later he emailed me from the states. He said he couldn't talk much about what he was doing but compared it to x box (I figured he was blowing shit up with drones). He sent me a chunk of money and started making payments and finally paid me back in full, with interest.   Haven't heard from him since. He wanted nothing from me, just wanted to do the right thing.

I have been busto before...couple years ago.  Mostly due to serious injury or death in my family.  Both happened close to each other.    I'm moving into farming.

poker,3dru2q,Asmithpoker,2,Sun Jul 19 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, its cool and all, but you cant ever do things like buy a house and support a family... you never move UP in life. Very few poker players make it to the elite ranks where they start claiming their yearly winnings and getting mortgages, I mean VERY few.  Of all the professionals I've met, they are mostly self made in another form of business, or they still live like children.  They rent a room or apartment that doesn't require a credit check, they live off of casino comps. They can't keep a girlfriend because they are so preoccupied with the game. Hell, most of the regs at my casino with decent looking chicks are being cheated on left and right because the regs are banging the dudes girlfriends on the side for tournament entries or whatever.  It's not a good scene unless you are the 0.001% who can crush the high limit games... but the same could be said for professional baseball, golf, etc. Everyone thinks they are special and have some sort of talent, but in reality you are doomed to fail. The chances of you having that special gift, are the same as the chances you have hitting a slot machine jackpot.... so save yourself a few years of your life and just go put your poker roll into a slot machine and go back to school to get a real job. The easiest way to win a wsop bracelet is to be a successful business man outside of poker"

Like others in this thread, when I resumed working (programming) after a couple of years playing poker (I posted my blog address earlier in this thread)  I started enjoying playing poker once or twice a week local to my home with the occasional splurge on a big tourney or poker-trip. Poker became fun again.    My future plans are to keep working, continue to enter a regular weekly tourney, enter a couple of cash games a month and once in a while splurge on a bigger poker tourney or a poker trip. For example a WPT or CardPlayer cruise might be in my future, and a few trips a year to Vegas is always in my future.   Also I want to keep a good balance in my life so poker is one of many hobbies and interests but does not become all-consuming."

poker,3dru2q,thermobee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:00:32 2015 UTC,I quit and moved to recreational play because online in the USA was no longer viable and I finished an engineering degree the May after black friday. I also live in a state where casinos are not legal. I stopped playing live underground games due to a knife being pulled on me after snapping off a 1k bluff in a 1/2 game by the bluffer who was on coke or something. Getting guaranteed money and benefits has been too nice to give up to go back and put up with that shit. Also can admit I was pretty terrible with managing the money after wins so losses hurt more. Just wasn't the life for me. I play about 2-5 times a year now and haven't really missed it.
poker,3dru2q,tmm1220,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:26:45 2015 UTC,"I used to work surveillance in a casino (not in Vegas), and I would supplement my income playing poker (not at the casino I worked at). I worked 40 hours a week, and played poker probably 60 hours a week. I was there for about six months before I moved. It was a good time. I could never get enough of the cards. The few times I visited Vegas, I could sit at a table for 20+ hours no problem.   Not all of that poker time was cash games though. I absolutely love tournaments, and I cashed ~70% of the time. Haven't played in a couple years now though, and I miss it terribly."

Averaged anywhere from $33,000-54,000 per year after taxes.  Black Friday basically shut it all down for me, Finding a job after poker was pretty difficult at first but I found one and now I make a healthy living outside of poker and still dabble online.   I loved having my own schedule with poker but at times when I was not running well it basically consumed my life trying to make up the money I lost."
poker,3dru2q,jzhoodie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:58:36 2015 UTC,I play for a living and I know a lot of other people who play for a living/have played for a living. A lot of my friends and friends of friends have been doing it for 10+ years. A couple of them have million dollar bankrolls playing at commerce in some crazy games. A lot of the guys I know that failed wasn't even because of poker. They lacked discipline. They would blow all their money on partying and drugs. Either that or they just had horrible bankroll management and would play games Way above their head. Some of these guys I know were crushers but were complete idiots off the table and didn't know how to handle themselves. Having balance is the most important part of playing for a living imo.
poker,3dru2q,myfistyourholes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just a couple years out of college.  Straight out college I got a job paying a lot (6 figures, and not in NYC or the Bay Area either) that I really wasn't well suited for at all. It's never a good feeling when literally everyone you work with is smarter than you, knows more than you, no matter how hard you work. I ended up getting fired (asked to quit) after a year. This isn't terribly uncommon, I've heard numbers anywhere from 15%-33% this happens to, and in a group of 9 friends I made when I started there who started at the same time it happened to 2 others as well. I had started playing poker while I was there at a local casino. I had done pretty well, and it was a lot of fun. Basically started with Friday night tourneys just as a fun thing to do. I lost the first two but came in first in the 3rd one and cashed in the next 4 I played. I continued going and did pretty well there, but shortly after the casino closed the poker room. This wasn't too much before I got fired. There's no other casino anywhere near here.  After that, I was kind of depressed, but figuring I have no kids, no wife, and a bit of money saved up, if I ever wanted to try making a go of poker (which I thought would be awesome), now was the time.  That's currently where I am now. It's been several months, and I've lost about 10K playing online (though I've lost about 30K to rake, so presumably that would mean I should be slightly better than an average player). It's very depressing. I worked my ass off to do as well in school as I could only to find out that in the real world everyone works their ass off and they're all smarter than you too.  I bought a gun back a few weeks before I got fired (I knew it was coming, it had already happened to one of my friends a few weeks previous to this) with the intention of killing myself if this didn't workout, wanting to have ready access to it should I decide that it was time. And I'm thinking I'll do that soon. As far as anyone else knows, I'm ""studying"" for my GRE and I'm going to apply to grad school. Though I'm not. People online say stuff about going to a shrink or taking drugs but I'm not going to (and no, I didn't keep up with my health insurance but even if I had I wouldn't want to go).   To clarify I don't blame poker for ruining my life or depressing me or anything. Poker was maybe an outlet but really it was a shot at something that might have made me happy, but didn't work. My parents love me but we're not close. I've only talked to them a handful of times since I graduated college. I figure I'd rather leave the money I have (like 35K) to my sister than live it out. There's no joy for me in working my ass off to continue living so I can work my ass off.   I'm not looking for any responses relating to ""Don't do it, there's so much to live for,"" ""Your parents will miss you,"" or ""Your life can be better, get a new job and try something else."" I don't care. But I figured that there's probably a few others on here that are in my situation that might be comforted in knowing they're not the only one."

No healthcare.  No vacation.  Hell, no paid holidays.  No 401k.  No pension.  In fact, I don't even pay social security, you are going to have to take care of all that.  Okay, but it is $50/hr.  Yeah, well, about payday...  You don't have a regular payday.  Sometimes it is Monday, sometimes Wednesday.  Sometimes you won't get paid until next week.  You need money on the 15th?  Better save it up, because you might not get paid between now and then, or maybe you will, but even then, you won't know how much.  Still want that job?  Oh, yeah, sometimes you will come to work but there won't be any work available.  Sometimes you will spend money, not get paid, and just have to go home.   Or just wait around, hoping some work comes available.   In fact, sometimes the ""boss"" will even hit you up for a loan.  He is usually pretty good about paying you back, but he can never tell you exactly when you will get paid back ... and of course, after getting paid back, you still won't know when the next paycheck is coming.

poker,3dru2q,FriedLizard,4,Sat Jul 18 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"This isn't even CLOSE to accurate if you're properly bank (and life) rolled for the games you're playing. If you actually have a proper bankroll for the games you're playing, and you have your 6 month emergency fund (and EVERYONE should have this, ESPECIALLY professional gamblers) you simply pay yourself on regular intervals, at an amount that's less than your hourly, regardless of your wins or losses for that time period.   If you're properly rolled, and you make $40/hr, pay yourself $25/hr. This allows your roll to sustain your downswings, and it rebuilds itself automatically. If you go on a particularly bad downswing, you always have the option of moving down.   Your entire argument falls apart when a professional is properly rolled and knows how to separate his poker bankroll from his paycheck."

poker,3dr2hu,itsmetakeo,7,Sat Jul 18 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"Hello Matías,  PokerStars continually monitors the games for collusion, and we sincerely appreciate you bringing your concerns to our attention. Following your report, we have completed an investigation into the accounts of players '******' and '******' .  While the most crucial aspect of a collusion investigation is reviewing the hand evidence, it is important to contextualize the hands in question before starting the game play analysis. One of the key tasks in that regard is finding out whether or not the suspect players have a relationship. Location can be a contributing factor in trying to determine the nature of a relationship between players.  In this case, both players live in Russia.  Location alone, however, is not sufficient in proving a relationship or as to whether cooperative play is occurring at the tables.  Aside from location, we use a variety of tools and methods to assist us in determining whether or not players are cooperating at our tables. One of the things we look at is their frequency of play together. Given how many players are playing on PokerStars at any given time, it would be unusual for seemingly unrelated players to frequently end up at the same table.  The players in this case have played a very small number of tournaments together relative to their overall amount of play on the site. This indicates that they are not seeking one another out.  That said, elements like location and play frequency are naturally not used to determine guilt or innocence by themselves. They are only used to provide us with a broader context as we take on the most essential part of any collusion investigation; a thorough review of the play itself. An advantage of online poker, as compared to live poker, is that every hand is recorded, allowing for a complete review. If any play is considered suspicious we can review the hands with all cards showing.  When reviewing tournament play for possible collusion we check for the following:  1) Best hand playing - where colluding players play only the better of their two hands.  2) Soft playing - where colluding players refuse to play aggressively against each other. For example they may check or fold against each other where they would normally bet or raise against a stranger.  3) Chip dumping/Stack balancing - where the large stack folds to the small stack to balance their chips. The idea is to improve the chances of both players finishing in money positions in a tournament.  We found no evidence of any of any team play.  That said, I can understand why you are suspicious of hand #138206343427.  I have attached it below for your reference.  *************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************  I agree that this hand looks unusual however, we can’t conclude that these players were colluding from this one and only isolated occurrence. Whilst we can’t say for certain why the player folded here we can definitely provide you with a few possibilities. Please consider the following:  1) It was a miss-click. We have some of the best multi-tablers on our site constantly making such mistakes, they are very common and the price that many multi-tablers pay for playing in a large number of events at the same time. Another reason for miss-clicking could be that they were doing something else on their computer in the background such as downloading some music or browsing the Internet which could have caused them to take the wrong action when the table popped-up. Please understand that be it online or live, all poker players regardless of their skill level have made the wrong fold (or call) at some point throughout their poker career.  2) It is possible that this player, not aware of the small number of chips their opponent had moved all-in with, based their decision only on their own cards. In such situations it is certainly possible that some players, even those playing large stacks, play incorrectly, considering only their own hands, and not properly weighing their opponents' chip count.  3) The player could not justify calling any size bet given the weak hand they held. Calling may have seemed meaningless as they were fairly confident they were not going to win the hand no matter what happened. A player familiar with ideal strategy would be inclined to call this all-in with almost any two cards. However, not all players understand this concept and how it is profitable to call all-ins, in such spots.  Please understand that we are not offering excuses, just possibilities to complement the facts of our detailed investigation. Yes, it is true that these reasons may seem like rare or wild occurrences but they are very common in an online environment happening multiple times a day on any poker site.  Given the lack of any relationship between their accounts, the relatively rare play together, and the lack of suspiciously played hands, there is no evidence to suggest these players are cooperating at our tables.  I have placed notes in the players' accounts indicating your concerns and the result of this review.  Once again, thank you for your report, and for choosing PokerStars.  Regards,  Lawrence PokerStars Game Integrity   It's hard for me to believe it was just a random occurrence, but it was :P.  Also,  in the hand attachment the support dude probably forget to remove this:     {LOL fold.  only for 1 chip, but i guess it's fine as it's one off and (player's name) only had queen high}   Now we know he had Q high."

poker,3drrny,blowitouturass,27,Sat Jul 18 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"When I run deep in tournaments I suck out on people at least once, usually multiple times. Be it in the form of having the worst hand all-in preflop, or coolering someone on the flop etc.  A majority of the time I bust in a tournament because someone sucked out on me.  This is because that's just the way it works. If you have to double your chips 20  ~10 times to get to the final table, and I get my money in 80/20 every single time, I am still more likely to bust than to make the final table.  This is how tournaments work, they are VERY variance heavy. When you get AA all in vs KK, you are going to lose 19% of the time in the long run.  It's not the website, it's just your inability to understand variance.  If the game is not enjoyable, stop playing, it's that simple.   Do I depo more and stop playing such low stakes? I cant stand people jaming with any two cards and sucking out on me repeatedly. Its the worst fucking feeling and its starting to creep into my game more and more frequently.   No, this is you being a dumbass. All that's going to change is the suckouts are going to happen the same amount of the time but you're going to have a smaller edge and people will outplay you.  Instead of focusing on results focus on decisions. Someone called you with 65o when you jammed AA? ""That's GREAT. Oh he won? Doesn't matter, I played well.""  edit: inb4 move up to where they respect your raises."

Disgusting suck outs. It really hits much heavier when you're playing stakes you shouldn't be. I found when I went back down to 2nl, I was totally fine with losing a suckout because I know I made the right decision and the other guy got lucky. Getting it in good when you can afford to lose the pot really feels different than when you can't. I waited until I was better rolled to move back to 10, and while I haven't had a series of disgusting suck outs back to back for a while, they still happen. Knowing you made the right choice means if you replay this hand 10 times with same villain cards and bet, you will win, and that is satisfying enough. But like I said, for me, losing to suck out at stakes I wasn't prepared for was far more devastating. Harder to see the light of proper decision making when you lost 10% of your roll. Advice: wait until you have at least 15BI for the stakes you're at, maybe more."

poker,3drrny,nonfunnyasian,4,Sun Jul 19 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"Just have a basic understanding of statistics, even though you were a 92% favourite, this was one of those times where it was the 8% and lost. It just so happened that the 8% time of losing happened an abnormal amount of times in a row but eventually it will even out assuming you continue to play well and put it in these same spots again you will surely win them many times in a row(but you won't remember the times you win).   Remember, the only way that these 92% numbers and 8% numbers actually make sense it over a very very large sample size so in the short term you will see weird deviations which are completely normal.  Just be okay with the results because suckouts are inevitable, don't let it make you play poorly.  Make sure you have a proper bankroll because as you can see even if you do everything right, sometimes there's just not a damn thing you can do.  ""that's poker"" -doyle brunson probably"
poker,3drrny,jasonrohrer,3,Sat Jul 18 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"The idea that this is an abnormal number of times in a row is a bit misleading.  Yes, if you set out, ahead of time, if there's an 8% chance each time, you'd expect it to happen only once in about 4 million tournaments.  BUT, once it has happened 5 times already, what is the chance of it happening a 6th time?  1 in 12.5.  So, there's this weird hindsight fallacy that happens when we asked ""what are the chances of that?"" after a string of events happen.  It happened, that's all we can say about it now, really.  If you just had your 6th 8% post-turn suck-out in a row, the answer to ""what are the chances of that?"" is actually 1 in 12.5, because you're asking that question too late for it to have meaning.  I've gotten AA two hands in a row twice in the last month.  It's supposed to be a 1/40K hand occurrence, and I doubt I've played 80K hands.  But after getting AA once, it's only 1/221 to get AA again on the next hand.  So, I'd expect every 221 AA to have exactly one AA as the next hand.  Have I seen 221 AA in the past month?  Maybe so.  After it happens, it feels like a crazy miracle, but that's just the selective recall bias.  I'm especially paying attention after each AA, and certainly notice any AA that immediately follows.  I didn't notice all the other, vast majority of situations where some random hand XX was NOT followed by AA and then AA."

Either way, at some point you are going to have to accept that variance is a thing. It makes the game soooo fun when you win, and soooo soul-sucking when you lose. If you can get your emotional state to the point where those highs and lows and as high and low, you'll be a far better player as a result."

I play poker for the entertainment, not because of financial reasons.  When your slightly overweight friend jokes about himself being fat, you laugh with him - not tell him he looks horrible and is a food addict. There is a difference between me joking about myself and strangers joking/insinuating I'm a gambling addict. I'm more astounded than I am butthurt. I just feel that nobody would act like this outside of the internet.   I did feel his comment was directed at me. I guess I do get defensive when somebody who doesn't know me judges me."

When I played in home games with bad players and I was noticeably better, I had guys look at my cards and only my cards to try to figure out what I was doing. I really minded at first and loudly protested. Eventually, we agreed everybody's cards (including theirs) or nobody's cards. Nobody's won."

If people are folding A LOT that doesn't mean you should start limping your strong hands, it means you should open wider preflop and steal blinds more often."

poker,3drqd9,Clarityy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"why is it awful?  i sometimes (very rarely) employ this strategy if i KNOW a maniac is going to make a large raise in late position to try and collect the limps in front of him.  I will especially do this if I know that said maniac would otherwise fold to my aggression.  I am talking about a very passive table w/ the exception of the serial button/late raiser.   I understand the concept of raising to protect my hand, but if i do come across that very special opponent I think it's effective strategy.  typically the maniac's huge raise and my re-raise effectively isolate the pot.    Is the danger that someone raises mid and is then flatted by the maniac?  Here I would make a pot sized raise in hopes of isolating and wait for the flop.  The other danger is that I misread our villain and don't get the raise I was hoping for.  now that sucks, but like I said, I am only making this play if am like 100% certain this dude is popping the pot.  This is pretty much the only situation I can think of where I limp AA.  Do you still think it's a bad play?  If so, why?"
poker,3drqd9,bojangles0023,2,Sun Jul 19 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"A maniac that raises you when you limp but folds when you open raise?  Alright let's say such a villain exists, what is our plan when he raises us? 3bet? If we 3bet is he going to 4bet bluff? If he 4bet bluffs in that spot why would he not 3bet bluff our open?  If villain calls our 3bet then we have less money in the pot than if we had opened/4bet."
poker,3drqd9,Clarityy,0,Sun Jul 19 01:07:05 2015 UTC,"Villain exists.  I am not saying this is a common situation, but it is one I experienced recently.    Essentially, pretty much the entire table would limp to this maniac who was raising 10-20BB and collecting all the ensuing folds.  When I would open 3-5BB everyone would fold including him.  This pattern continued for a while, until I looked down at rockets UTG.  So I thought ""well fuck I'll just limp and then fire"".  Sure enough, everyone limps after me until he pops it 20BB.  IIRC he's pretty much pot committed so it doesn't require much of a decision on my part.  I shove picking up the 20BB plus the 6limps.  Plus I think he called.  Bonus.    Had I opened probably everyone folds or someone calls for the 3-5BB I open with and then we play.    I really feel like the limp helped me maximize my value.    Again, this is a SUPER SPECIAL situation.  I am definitely not arguing this is +EV generally.  I just believe there is a time and place for strange plays like this."
poker,3drqd9,bojangles0023,2,Sun Jul 19 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"I suppose in the exact scenario you're describing limping is better than raising. But this raises more questions than answers, why does the entire table keep limping if he's doing this? do all the limpers fold to an open raise? Does the guy fold to an open raise?  It doesn't make much sense to me, but given the parameters you've given yeah, limping > raising."
poker,3drqd9,brp77,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:02:29 2015 UTC,yea it wasn't making much sense to me either.  a bunch of shit players is what it was.  sometimes you have to get creative
poker,3drqd9,bojangles0023,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:21 2015 UTC,"Because when you raise and the same amount of people, who would limp in call your raise, will make the pot a lot bigger and it will be easier for you to get all the money in before the flop.   The player you are speaking about is very contradictive, you call him a maniac and then you say he folds to your aggression, which consists of a preflop raise? If he is a good LAG player he will easily see through your limp-raise and just fold."
poker,3drqd9,brp77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"Essentially, pretty much the entire table would limp to this maniac who was raising 10-20BB and collecting all the ensuing folds. When I would open 3-5BB everyone would fold including him. This pattern continued for a while, until I looked down at rockets UTG. So I thought ""well fuck I'll just limp and then fire"". Sure enough, everyone limps after me until he pops it 20BB. IIRC he's pretty much pot committed so it doesn't require much of a decision on my part. I shove picking up the 20BB plus the 6limps. Plus I think he called. Bonus.  Had I opened probably everyone folds or someone calls for the 3-5BB I open with and then we play.  I really feel like the limp helped me maximize my value.  Again, this is a SUPER SPECIAL situation. I am definitely not arguing this is +EV generally. I just believe there is a time and place for strange plays like this."

poker,3drqd9,eyememine,4,Mon Jul 20 08:32:29 2015 UTC,"Always open raise a hand that you want to play, never limp.  AA is the strongest hand preflop, so if you raise and people call then you are instantly having your opponents make mistakes.  If you limp they can profitably overlimp, and if you limp/raise then you are turning your hand face-up and your opponents might actually fold AK or QQ where they normally would get all the money in."

In an aggressive game limping in early position might be better....as far as playing a pot pre flop IP, a substantial raise against limpers is definitely the way to go. I would go for 3 - 5 times the big blind +1 big blind for each additional limper already in the pot.  ALWAYS raise in late position.....i limp only in early middle position when there are known aggressors behind me.  Limping in the small blind when folded to is also pretty fun as well. Subterfuge can pay off in dividends.  I also like calling with aces out of the blinds against a player with a high VPIP....and walk the dog OOP for maximum value....works great later on in tournaments too...."

For the $10 ticket there's a lot of options and I might try to pick up a few more of these via satellites but I'll probably prioritize the 15k first (event 30).

poker,3ds7er,yrbuttz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"50% is on the low side. Main considerations are opponents reaction to cbets and their range.So somebody who is folding to <60% of cbets porbably sticks around with more speculative hands a lot, against people like this who you think are floating try introducing some double and maybe triple barrels and adjust from that. Obviously if they're calling three streets with middle pair then just don't cbet light. As for ranging your opponent, consider for example if you open UTG with AK and get flatted IP by a decentish opponent, you should think about how the board hits both of your ranges. eg a 789s flop hits your opponents range much harder than it does yours, and you should often consider letting go of the hand rather than barrelling money into a board which your opponent knows he can bluff raise you off alot because it improves his range alot more than it does yours. Similarly, if you open 88 UTG and get flatted IP by the same reg, you can cbet alot of Axx and Kxx boards succesfully because very often, these are the boards which hit your range hardest. Hopes this helps and gives you some stuff to think about."

Floating a small bet on flop is OK with all your backdoor draws but at 2NL it's fine to just fold to any reasonable cbet if you flop nothing. It's not really exploitable because people usually bet when they hit something (including donk bets). Since opponent bets pot, I assume this is Qx or better most of the time and you should fold. Raising likely accomplishes nothing since V almost never bet/folds when he makes it pot initially. You made ace with good kicker and opponent x. He most likely has a Qx/KK hand when he x the turn. I would bet/fold the turn here. Obviously against a better player you would x back a lot more to play pot control, but at 2 NL when you make a pair of aces with medium kicker just bet out 2/3-3/4 of the pot. Call turn as played. You can beat Qx/KK and some janky Ax hands. Raising likely isolates yourself against 2p+ or TPTK which you lose against. I'm almost certain your opponent had a Qx type hand as played."

poker,3dqn8d,Furples,8,Sat Jul 18 15:01:32 2015 UTC,we miss value when it limps around if we aren't limping AA/KK then we cap our range if we are also open limping AA/KK then we miss a ton of value with AA/KK we give people the opportunity to overlimp and realize their equity with speculative hands we make a lot of mistakes with marginal hands OOP without the initiative unless we're a postflop wizard
poker,3dqn8d,PokerJunkieKK,2,Sat Jul 18 15:17:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense.  Thank you.

Very few players can avoid mistakes OOP, especially when you haven't narrowed your opponents' range at all."

poker,3dqn8d,cantors_set,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"I understand it was a broad question, I guess I was hoping for more discussion rather than specific advice.    In early position, if I bet a hand, I rarely fold to three bets, with the exception of an over jam.  I expect to get three bet with hands like AJ+, KQs, PP, etc depending on villain's range.  And my 4 bet range includes hands that I will almost always call 5 bets or push with, depending on stack size and villain tendencies.    Again, I was trying to keep things general in the post to spark conversation rather than specific advice.    I'm just starting to understand micro stakes, and I'm trying to build a foundation from very basic strategy.  Obviously my definition of TAG is not as tight it should be, so that helps me.   I appreciate your response. The problem isn't that I don't understand these things, it's that I don't think about them, so seeing it explained helps a lot."
poker,3dqn8d,NihilisticToad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"When you open UTG and someone who isn't a maniac or super LAG 3bets you, consider folding a lot of your range. Players these days know that UTG opens are the tightest range of any position so when you get 3bet you are often facing a very tight range of JJ+, maybe AQ+ (a lot of people will flat AQ here though and only 3bet AK vs UTG). You are massively exploitable if you don't adjust your EP opening range and don't ever fold to 3bets when you are OOP."
poker,3dqn8d,NihilisticToad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"So let's say I open UTG with 22-99 and just flat a 3bet, is set mining profitable long term?  A lot of the time I'm not going to get 3bet, and when I do it's probably minimal.  I probably don't understand EV enough to know whether it is wise to play like this."

You basically have to slam the pot on the flop. Checking it there is incredibly bad. You don't have position but you repped a monster pre and none of the hands you we're repping should be too scared of this board. In reality even if you do get called behind you certainly have at least 8 outs in the form of catching either end of the straight draw, and it's possible your king is alive too if he has Jacks or Queens.

poker,3dminh,maximum_wages,8,Fri Jul 17 14:11:33 2015 UTC,I would really like to see some analysis on this hand. I never know what to do in these spots.
poker,3dminh,gyom999,23,Fri Jul 17 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"I would say that the only ""analysis"" you can make in that kind of spot is that @ 100bb, you can't really fold top pair in a 4b pot. And your either beat or not, pretty much turning your hand into a bluff catcher.. and for that you need to let him bluff by not value betting and making him fold worst.  The small flop stab can make him beleive he has fold equity and/or make him call with worst.. So he can float pretty wide here since he has position.  On the turn, well you continue your ""well I have nothing"" story by checking and letting him bet. Sure you can be beat, but like I said you're not hitting TP in a 4b pot 100bb deep to fold.. So let him beleive he can make you fold when he has nothing."

When you hit, you bet and then you played the turn and river perfectly just calling knowing all you had was showdown value and a bluff catcher hand.   Villains line a pretty standard bluff."
poker,3dminh,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:52 2015 UTC,Is the flop bet designed to get him to call or raise with nothing?
poker,3dminh,gyom999,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Well it accomplishes many things.   First, it can make villain beleive he still have fold equity since the small bet shows weakness (he can see that as a cheap bluff attempt), so he can decide to shove his draws or float and do somekind of float/move on later streets (he's IP).  Second, it can make villain call worst hands (like a gutshot in that case) or things like KK-QQ (again he can see the small bet as a cheap bluff attempt so he might think he's good).  Third, I guess it balance your range vs when you have nothing/draw and take a stab with a cheap bluff/semi-bluff. Sure it kinda contredict point 1 & 2 (villain calling more wide or using fold equity), but at ~20% pot bet, it doesn't have to work very often (specially if you have equity to add up). If villain is the kind of player defending pretty loose with things like 88-TT, T9 or whatever.. he's gonna feel awfulm facing the small bet."

poker,3dnm4w,skinnyfatdudebro,4,Fri Jul 17 22:39:36 2015 UTC,Can you explain your reason for not 4bet pre because it seems like a pretty big mistake given your read.  As played I probably would bet smallish (175-225) on the flop and not fold to anyone except the BB. The SB and 3bettor don't have much more so will most likely shove or fold and it gives the LAG player the perception of fold equity to stick it in with something worse. With no reads on the BB its just not good enough a hand to get in with him this deep and you're gonna have to let him have it if he gets frisky  Also think the original raise should be bigger pre

If you don't like the shove answer then you probably should have left the table with your $1700.    and you probably should have left, if you are rolled to be playing a $300 max buy-in game and run $300 up to $1700 you probably have too much money on the table, although effective stack-wise you are only playing with about half that."

poker,3dnm4w,Four_Months,2,Fri Jul 17 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kind of hard to quantify ""effective stack"" when there is 1 person that has you covered, the next largest stack is about half, and you've got a couple of players with a couple hundred.  Until you see who calls and who folds and who is left to act you never really know how deep you are actually playing.

Your SPR on the flop is approx. 2.5.  If you subscribe to that line of thinking, you should be going broke on this hand. After all any Ah, K w a heart or maybe a bare king is coming along in this pot.   I think betting is probably the correct EV play, but for my sanity, I probably check and pray for a good turn."

poker,3dnm4w,SolivenInc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:27 2015 UTC,I find limp reraises here are usually 99+. His 3bet sizing is really small here so you should expect overcalls behind you when you flat. (Which really makes the pot to stack sizes really awkward) You can definitely 4-bet get it in preflop with all that dead money in there. 330 in the middle after MP 3bets you. I also think the LAG is more likely to spaz overcall/jam your 4-bet than to 4-bet MPs 3-bet.  As played just bet 400+ on the flop and get it in against the smaller stacks.
poker,3dnm4w,foutight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:20:29 2015 UTC,reraise to 350$ and call it off if he shoves . seeing a flop multiway is pretty bad imo. if ur aggro preflop u should def get it pre
poker,3dnm4w,nobazn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:53:03 2015 UTC,"If your read is spot on, why not raise the flop to isolate the manic.  Then you wouldn't have gotten yourself into this situation vs 4 other players on a wet board."
poker,3dnm4w,miles5555,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:02:11 2015 UTC,"If you know MP doesn't have AA and KK, why not re-raise/shove pre? When you take those hands out of his range, AK is so much better. He has no hands that dominate you. Now you have to bet the flop because you can't afford to let a random heart beat you."
poker,3dnm4w,eyememine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:05:02 2015 UTC,"Here's why you always pay attention to the players on the flop: did they check their hole cards? If they did that most likely means that they didn't flop the flush and are looking if they have a heart, unless they're doing some sort of reverse tell. If everyone happened to look at their hole cards go hard unless a heart comes off. Also what happened?"
poker,3dnm4w,tensor0910,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"this is the situation where I love that I'm in a live game and not online.  Every single person checked their hole card except me because I knew I was suited black. I ended up betting $350 on the flop. The SB called for the rest of his stack about (~200).  The BB (big stack) tanked for a minute, which just told me has a big heart and the pot is tempting him. He eventually folded, complaining the whole time.  Everybody else folds. Villian admits to having two black Queens.  The board bricks out and I take it down.  Oh what did SB call with?  22 with the 2 of hearts. lol."

I think a flat here is fine.  on this monotone board 5 ways I'm putting in a small bet....300 or so.  People dont usually get crazy on super wet boards like this, and you want to charge for Ahx to draw to the flush, and fold to a shove"
poker,3dnpmm,Deerfucker,15,Fri Jul 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,What if I told you that you could do both?
poker,3dnpmm,Four_Months,4,Fri Jul 17 20:06:01 2015 UTC,"Multi table tournaments have a much higher variance than any cash game and, therefore,you need a higher bankroll to avoid going bust.   If you have $200 to play 10NL, that same roll would allow you to comfortably play in $1 buy in tournaments on a consistent basis (with a low chance of bankroll busto)."
poker,3dnpmm,MathW,2,Sat Jul 18 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"Cash games AINEC. The most successful poker players in terms of money made playing poker play cash games - Ivey, Brunson, Dwan. Tournaments simply have way too much variation to be a viable option to make money when compared to cash games.  Having said that, if you REALLY love tournaments and hate cash games, you should probably play tournaments.  Cash games are also superior to tournaments because of the amount of freedom they provide. When you enter a tournament, you have to show up when the tournament is being held - their schedule, not yours. When you lose your flip AK vs QQ or get coolered with AA vs KK or get sucked out on with your AA and their 44, can you reload? No. You have to find and wait for another tournament and go through all that AGAIN!  I started out with sit n' goes back in the poker boom and soon realized after switching all the advantages of cash games. It was much more even keeled with much more freedom. I even switched my home games to cash as it made much more sense - less coordination, less people sitting around after they busted, and the like.  And while you CAN do both, I generally don't recommend it to most players as it's good to focus on one discipline if you want to maximize your earnings."
poker,3dnpmm,clkou,2,Fri Jul 17 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"Low buy in tournaments like that are often raked to such an extreme degree that it's impossible to play them profitably. Same thing with 1/2 and 2/4 limit hold 'em - the rake at most places is too high in proportion to the size of the pots to beat them. (I'm basing this off my experience playing in Florida, where the rake cap is the same $7 per hand regardless of whether you're playing 2/4 limit or 2/5 no limit.)  If your goal is to lose your bankroll as slowly as possible, then play the small buy in tourneys and low limit hold 'em. But IMO your best chance at actually showing a profit is in no limit cash games, so my advice would be to focus on those."
poker,3dnpmm,TheDigitalRuler,2,Sat Jul 18 05:30:04 2015 UTC,"I would say play within your bankroll and what you're comfortable in.  You can play no limit and limit is you can adjust.  To be successful, it's all about game selection.  Choose the game that's going to maximize your profits.  I don't play tournaments a lot but when I do it's an amount that doesn't hurt my bankroll."
poker,3dnpmm,nobazn,2,Sat Jul 18 08:58:05 2015 UTC,Tournaments are soul sucking.  So I would recommend cash.
poker,3dnpmm,Oblivious-otter,2,Sat Jul 18 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"MTT's are a more well-rounded game of poker. You will obviously have experience from cash playing deep stack ( relative to early levels/100bb+ stack in MTT). However you need to be comfortable playing close to 10-20BB. IMO if you have patience MTT's can be more 'exploitable' than cash, even the live fishy 1/2.  Just as a question where abouts are you playing? In my case several casinos in London run daily tournaments around the buy in range you mentioned."

If you have to re-buy twice don't bother IMO. Stick to 50 cent / $1 entry tourneys, only lose a few bucks, decent competition, and can win $50+"
poker,3dnpmm,vethlock,3,Sat Jul 18 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"First and foremost you should play whatever you find the most enjoyable. If you actually care about profiting then I would avoid low stakes live limit cash games and live low stakes tournaments. The rake on these games is absurd and I've heard a lot of people say they are almost unbeatable no matter how good you are. Keep in mind that it is going to take a veeeeery long time to build a decent sample size playing live if you want to prove to yourself you are a winning player.... having a 4 session winning streak or being ""up"" in profit playing once a week for a year really don't mean anything. Bad players can achieve these same results.   If your goal is to improve your game while not risking your entire bankroll then play microstakes games online and grind a up a roll to prove you are a winner."
poker,3dnpmm,NoDadNot2Nite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:43 2015 UTC,Problem is that no one has time to sit there and play for only 5 cents like if I play online and play for pennies I might as well get a full time job.

In other words, your equity given that your opponent is betting is less than it was on earlier streets."
poker,3dp5ol,jkugelman,3,Sat Jul 18 03:31:29 2015 UTC,How do I get out my head the thought process that if I have an Ace and there is an Ace on the board the chance of an opponent having an Ace is so small that I should pretend they never do and play as if Im the only one with top pair etc?
poker,3dp5ol,jkugelman,3,Sat Jul 18 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"You need to put your opponents on hand ranges that make sense given the action. If they're putting in a lot of money on an ace high board, why are they doing that? It sounds like you're focused way too much on board texture and ignore the action. Every time your opponent puts money in the pot you need to adjust their hand range."
poker,3dp5ol,CoReCicero,5,Sat Jul 18 15:08:02 2015 UTC,Bad hands fold out. The board improves hands. People will bet when their hands are improved. Just because you have equity with no cards on board doesn't mean you have equity on boards that miss you...

poker,3dlour,hoopaholik91,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:30 2015 UTC,Forcing employees to invest in the business before they can begin to make money is definitely not the norm
poker,3dlour,PsykCheech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"They aren't employees, the business model is technically a franchising model so they act like business owners purchasing inventory to sell. So the same way any business has inventory on hand so do these ""business owners""."

Edit: the business model isn't the scam. Just like paying someone to invest your money isn't a scam. But the second your investor lies about how he got his ROI and begins a pyramid scheme, then it becomes a scam."
poker,3dlour,PsykCheech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"Nothing about the actual plan is illegal, but you're right in the way that people present the plan and guaranteed income is an issue. The one's higher up are probably not lying about their incomes. Hysterically the ones making more money are not lying because the bonuses are silly after a certain point.  For the lower peons, they are the ones that are exaggerating their incomes because it's an easier sell to friends and family. (First people the peons reach out to)"

poker,3dlour,ichdurfte,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Can you explain to me or anyone for that matter, how ChoiceCenter is a cult?  It seems to me it's just seminars for people that want to better their life.  People aren't having to sign over their houses/cars, forced to pay to increase their experience or separated from their families.  It seems to be seminars in exchange for a fee, just like TED talks or the Blackhat conference.  Typically, what people consider cults, cut people down by removing something in their life for nothing in return (Scientology cuts you away from family and has you sign your possessions over in order to increase your theton (spelling) level.)  So maybe I'm missing something but from what I understand it's people that have a hard time rationalizing how to achieve their goals by themselves so they're paying ChoiceCenter to build them up and teach them how to do this.  If I am missing something critical, please do enlighten me and have some kind of evidence.  I'm not a fan of hearsay, since it spreads lies.  From everything I've read, it seems like it's a service for weakminded people but not a cult.  Thanks"

That's not to say it's unbeatable, but you really need to understand a few of the finer details of PLO. You'll find there is more aggression against villains in position. AAxx is generally played super aggro. There's still plenty of fish though. 25PLO can be softer in some circumstances I find."
poker,3dm3yj,SportsGame,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:52 2015 UTC,25 is softer than 10?! I'm shocked at that
poker,3dm3yj,modano_star,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:54 2015 UTC,In a weird way though. Economically more people can afford to play 10 NL (countries which are less economically developed) so you tend to find a lot of super-grinders at 10PLO. Whereas 25 PLO is too rich for a lot of people and you end up with random european casuals. This is a HUGE generalization though and may be completely inaccurate.
poker,3dm3yj,aritalo,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:21 2015 UTC,super rich grinders at 10 plo is definitely an oxymoron

When you c-bet, you hope to take it down right now and not let him run into one of the overcards on the turn that beats you. You do have showdown value, so you might choose to check the flop, play small ball, hope to get to the river cheaply, and win when he has nothing. You might make the decision based on how best to exploit this villain. If you think he is a loose passive who will fold unless he has something, then you might as well c-bet and not give him any chance to hit. If you think he is more aggressive, then you might try to conserve your dwindling 21.82 BB stack.

poker,3do1cl,kirkslemonade,7,Fri Jul 17 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"One thing people mention which I can't an't wrap my head around is the saying that with more people left to act, there is more chance someone will wake up with a monster and that's the reason we open tight UTG. I find this hard to believe and wonder if there is any maths behind it.   I don't even need math to explain this, just basic intuition.   If it's folded to me in the SB and I raise, what are the odds BB has AA? If I'm utg and I raise, what are the odds HJ, CO, BTN, SB or BB has AA?   Which of these do you think is higher?  If I deal you 6 2-card hands instead of 1, which ""group"" is more likely to have AA in it? The 6 2-card group or the one 2-card group?  Now expand it to a reasonable range, let's say A8s+ ATo+ 55+ T9s+ TJo+. This is 17.50% of hands.  So if it's folded to me in the SB (ignoring our cards for blockers) there is a 17.50% chance the BB has one of those hands.  If I flip a perfect coin that is exactly 50/50 once, if I flip it once there is a 50% chance it will come heads. However if I flip it five times there is an >80% chance that it will come heads at least once.  If I'm utg, every player with a hand has a 17.50% chance to have one of those hands. Which has the bigger chance of happening, 17.50% once or 17.50% five times?  Therefore with more players behind us, it is more likely someone has a hand that will play back at us.   Ok to the point. In 6max game you're on the btn that folded to you. Since everyone has folded behind you wouldn't that increase the chance that someone in the blinds has a monster because the people that folded didn't have playable hands?   It is very minimal to the point of it having no relevance. For example, utg can fold A2, HJ can fold K5 and CO can fold Q9o and now it's actually less likely that SB or BB has a top 17.50% hand. We don't know what we folded so we just pretend the muck is still in the deck for counting the amount of cards in the deck.  That pretty much balances out when early positions fold rags.   but that makes me wonder why don't we open suited connectors from UTG because it will not clash with high cards with top pair value.   This has to do with position. If we are opening wide utg (adding suited connectors will quickly do this) then people will be calling/raising us more.   Now lets say we are playing on a table with 20 people would the average hand strength lower or increase. Wouldn't it harder to make a nut hand because so many cards are being used up.   Why? Every hand will be two cards. Say we have KQ. The only hands that ""beat"" KQ preflop are A2s+ A2o+ QQ+, that's 16% of hands.  Now imagine there's 20 others players and we have KQ. 40/50 cards are being dealt. It's very very unlikely for no one to be dealt an ace, so we're basically always ""beat""."

If I'm utg and I raise, what are the odds HJ, CO, BTN, SB or BB has AA? Which of these do you think is higher?<   Would not it be the same. Lets say 1 in every 100 rounds someone has aces exactly.

poker,3do1cl,PrestaJay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"if they fold, they don't have aces. If they haven't acted, they might have aces."
poker,3do1cl,earth159,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:02:49 2015 UTC,"The difference between early and late position is really about information.   The table has 5 chances to get AA regardless of where you are, but if you are in late position, you get to see what all the people in front of you are doing before you have to make a decision. So it's true that they may have AA, but you will see them raise it before you have to commit any money.   If you're in early position, you have to choose your action without any information, and that's why it's a disadvantage and why we play fewer hands there."
poker,3do1cl,earth159,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"I think what you're missing is the conditional probability here. People aren't trying to say ""it is less likely there are aces at the table the later position you are"", what they mean is IF people have folded around to you, they didn't have aces (or any other ""good"" hand) for sure, so armed with that information you can widen your range.  So the way to think of it imo is- yes, you are right that the chance of someone at the table has a monster never changes no matter your position before anyone acts- what does change with position is, later position vs. earlier position with a strong hand, you get to see most of the other players actions before you have to act.   So say (picking an arbitrary probability for sake of simple math) there's a 20% probability that any given player at the table wakes up with a hand they want to play (and therefore a 80% chance they will fold to your open raise)- again, that simple fact doesn't change dependent on YOUR position, you are right. BUT if there are say 8 people at the table yet to act (which is the case opening UTG on a full-ring table), and each has a 20% chance of waking up with a strong hand (80% of folding) then you have a .88 = .167 or only 16.7% of the time will nobody have a hand strong enough to play against you.  On the other hand, if you are say on the cutoff, with only 3 people left to act, you have already seen 5 people fold and therefore already have the information that they didn't have a monster. Those people who folded could have been dealt a monster, and had a 20% chance of this, but they folded this hand, so clearly they didn't pick up a hand this time. That is no longer a matter of chance, it is a fact you now know, based on what you have observed as the action moved around the table to you. Now, all that is unknown is the hands of the last three people to act- the blinds and the button. Therefore, if we use the same arbitrary numbers as before (though this is probably even more inaccurate here as a strong player's defending range would likely be much wider in a position like the BB or button, keeping it simple to explain the concept that OP is asking about), .8 probability each player will fold then .83 = .512 = 51.2% or over half the time none of the remaining players will have a hand worth playing.  This is a pretty simplified explanation of the math behind this idea, hopefully it helps.  PS. A (hopefully) even simpler way of getting at the core of this idea is just thinking- how many hands should I be opening against one opponent? against two? against three? against nine? Common sense should tell you that in a heads up match, with one opponent, you should be playing a lot more hands than a full-ring game, probably somewhere around half the hands you are dealt. The more opponents you are playing against the more you are going to select your hands. This is the same idea that is carried over to late position play in an unopened pot- it isn't exactly the same, but if it helps make this idea intuitive, its probably fine to just think of a spot like this almost as if you are playing short-handed against the rest of the players."
poker,3do1cl,Four_Months,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"I think the simplest way to respond to this is- Yes you're right the BB is just as likely to have aces as anyone, but the BB and SB left to worry about at this point if you're on the button. Imagine you were three seats to the left and opened, you still have to worry about the BB having aces right? But then, there's the guy to his left, can't he have aces too? and the guy to his left?   So, the more we move back around the table toward UTG the more possible aces we have to be concerned about, since there are more people who have yet to bet or fold (even though the chance each individual might have them is the same). Poker (at least preflop) is played against the table, not one person (excepting heads-up play). As the action moves around the table, as long as the pot remains unopopened, the table becomes smaller and smaller."
poker,3do1cl,Clarityy,2,Sun Jul 19 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Now lets say we are playing on a table with 20 people would the average hand strength lower or increase. Wouldn't it harder to make a nut hand because so many cards are being used up.   You could try a little experiment.  Deal yourself a hand.  Now deal 1 or two other hands.  See if those 1 or 2 hands are better than your hand and how often that occurs.  Now deal yourself a hand.  Then deal 20 other hands.  See how often one of those 20 other hands is a ""monster"" that some one would play against you.  Compare the results of your hand versus 1 or 2 other hands and your hand versus 20 other hands.    Can see a reason why you would want to open tighter when UTG against 20 people?"

poker,3do1cl,RudolfKGB,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:35 2015 UTC,"In 6max game you're on the btn that folded to you. Since everyone has folded behind you wouldn't that increase the chance that someone in the blinds has a monster because the people that folded didn't have playable hands?   Yes, there is a slight effect.  Probably in the 2% - 5% range or so.   Isn't there the same chance if you opened from UTG and BTN that someone left to act will have a monster?   No, not at all."
poker,3do1cl,Tiltboy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"You need a stronger hand to make up for your lack of position but you also need to balance.   That's the answer as to why we need strong hands to open early.  So, say you ONLY raise from UTG with AA. Good players will pick up on that, depending on what limits you play.   Now, in order to be profitable, you need to balance that by opening from UTG with other hands that play well multiway, like small suited connectors or small pocket pairs.   Its just not very profitable in low stakes because the competition isn't sophisticated enough to pick up what you're putting down."

Even if you look over the last 6 months, I've only put in $60, but I've gotten a total of $90 bonus in the past 31 days.

You have many combos that whiff here, and another part of your range that merely checks back, that isn't calling a third barrel. I understand we're very low in our range, basically nut bottom, but that doesn't mean we should be bluffing it always. Also note his cb on turn is interesting, it's not a great barrel card barring his suited hands, which I'd weigh far more towards value thats indifferent to the texture. timing tell on turn is important I think."

poker,3diq8l,clkou,14,Thu Jul 16 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"I used NO bankroll management, constantly took shots, and relentlessly chased my losses.   Your post is well thought out and full of good wisdom that everyone should heed whether they're fresh off the bus or a seasoned veteran. I'm quoting the sentence about bankroll management because when I started poker, that was the MOST important part. I think I can have a bit of an addictive personality in the sense that when I find something I like, I do it well beyond moderation. I feared something in the way of a gambling problem could creep in UNLESS I created a fool proof system of discipline. That system had NOTHING to do with my skill or results at the poker table, rather just how I handle my money, wins, losses, stakes I play, and the like.  I've been playing for over 10 years and have never had anything close to a gambling problem BECAUSE in my opinion I stick to strict bankroll management. I guess it's a question for someone much more qualified than me to hypothesize if a gambling problem is born because one doesn't follow bankroll management or if a person with a gambling problem inherently can't follow bankroll management for some reason. But, certainly if you don't follow bankroll management, you're going to go busto if you have a gambling problem or not. And, if you don't or can't follow bankroll management, then you may already have a problem or be on your way to having one.  I just posted a new thread about how to follow bankroll management if anyone is interested in reading and commenting:  https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/3dj7ch/bankroll_management/"

poker,3diq8l,pdxsean,3,Thu Jul 16 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've been working in a poker room for coming up on five years now, most of that time was spent managing with access to confidential player information. It really shocked me (and depressed me) to see just how many people lose money over long periods of time. Years.    In any given month, about 20% of tournament players would come out ahead. However if you stretch out that time to multiple months, the percentages grow considerably smaller. I would think it's safe to say that less than 5% of our players have made a profit over any long period of time. I can think of three that have made enough of a profit to actually consider it a ""job"" and I doubt any of those three have cleared more than $20k/yr balanced out.  Sure this is based off of numbers I ran about a year ago, and I don't have that information in front of me anymore, and it's tournament only. So take it for what it is worth, but it was something I took seriously to discover.   The good news is the great majority who lose money don't seem to have their lives destroyed. I can think of a small handful of people who have gone through similar situations as OP while regular customers at my card room, but maybe 15-20 out of 5000 or so ""regular"" players we've had over the years. I'd say compared to blackjack or slots or other addictive gambling games, Poker is much less harmless."

poker,3diq8l,abomb999,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this post, glad you're clean now Tom, how long has it been since you played poker?  I'm ex-addict, used to go to AA meetings, sober for 2 years, and then I then I found a philosophy + health program that allows me to occasionally indulge in moderation ( a little bit of alcohol) and life has been gravy for a long time, but the point is that I can relate to the addiction manifestation in humans, both biologically and psychological.   I know poker can be the tool of an addict as much drugs, sex and food.   I'm a winning poker player whose strongest asset is BRM, and I have a great personality so I have become friends with other players, including the degens.  It's scary and sad to see people addicted to poker and there's nothing I can do, only they can help themselves, and often they need to reach rock bottom short of a miracle.  I know a older guy in his 40s and he's playing $2/4 online while trying to manage a business, and if can't stop, he's going to lose everything. There's no logic behind it, it's an escape for him and he loves the feeling he get's from playing poker.  Keep working your program Tom,  Stay strong!"
poker,3diq8l,NihilisticToad,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you said ex addict. When I went to rehab, and even in NA meetings, they really tried to push the whole ""once an addict, always an addict"" mentality."
poker,3diq8l,jdepps113,3,Fri Jul 17 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"I think ""once an addict, always an addict"" applies to most people, but not all.  Some people change suffiiciently over time to be able to partake in moderation again.  Problem is if you tell a roomful of addicts that maybe one or two of them will be able to do this one day, they'll all cling to the belief that they're the one who can manage it, and it'll play a huge part in relapse for many of them.  Better if, since it's true for 97% of them, you just tell them all that they'll never get over this completely and they all have to avoid alcohol entirely from now on.  And those other 3% can possibly figure it out on their own, I guess."
poker,3diq8l,abomb999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"As they say in the programs, take what you need, leave the rest. For some people, they find it best to consider themselves life long addicts and never touch the substance again and good for them if they have a found way to better their life. I've met others in the program who still go, and they have learned to indulge once in a while. There are also many people who have completely left the anonymous programs who have learned to moderate.   You need to find out what works for you."

I think that that's because everyone shares a common feeling toward poker as far as addiction goes. You don't play poker because you have to. You play because you really enjoy it. You make time for it. It could be a slight addiction but it's an addiction to say the least. I had to quit playing when I was 19. I started back up last year, I'm 28 now. I enjoy playing at this older age as my wisdom and patients has changed drastically. The young me over drew my accounts. I don't want to play constantly like I used to.

You can know how to play, study hard, and be good at it, but still screw up royally through lack of self control.  In fact, it may be the single most important aspect of long-term success at the game.  It also feels like, ""If I can master myself in this hard of a situation, I can handle myself in any situation.""  The other side of that coin is that poker may be the most dangerous situation of all.  You really are walking a tightrope over the grand canyon, especially in no limit.

poker,3diq8l,petzergling,-10,Thu Jul 16 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"I studied poker relentlessly from the moment I became fascinated with the game. I read books upon books, immersed myself in twoplustwo, analyzed my hand histories, tried to eliminate my leaks -- I could go on and on. The point I'm making is that even if you're smart about playing and take it seriously, an addict is still an addict.   Part of poker knowledge is bankroll management.  You claim to be super smart , educated with a successful business.  I don't see how anyone with half a brain that does this will massively chase losses and take shots endlessly.  Even if you ""studied poker relentlessly"" you didn't fucking listen to a word of what anyone said or else you wouldn't have done what you did.  How can you honestly say that you ""studied"" poker or even put in any amount of work or had a love for the game when you didnt even respect the basic starting rules that every other poker player follows.  Chances are you as a person would have hit rock bottom doing whatever you did, whether its bankrupting your business or getting addicted to drugs or whatever.  You give poker a bad name"

poker,3diq8l,OMGLUCKBOX,10,Thu Jul 16 16:41:59 2015 UTC,Posting and lurking in a poker subreddit definitely isn't positive progress in gamblers anonymous. Should be avoiding places like this at all costs. By the tone of the post the you can tell the guy still thinks he could crush if it wasn't for bankroll management. It would probably be better for him to just tell him he was a degen and sucks at poker rather than holding out any hope for him because I'm sure it would be easy for people who are degenerate gamblers to fall back into the cycle like any addiction.
poker,3diq8l,wafflesnsyrup,5,Thu Jul 16 17:01:08 2015 UTC,Tbh sounds to me like he is a degen who sucks at poker
poker,3diq8l,obeydadawg,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:38 2015 UTC,For sure but cut the guy some slack. He's trying to do some good / feel better about himself no need to just bash him.

Sounds like you're a crusher bro you'll be stacking cheddar in no time""   Naw dudes going to punt his life away again if we say something like that.   There's tapping the glass, and then there is letting these guys think it's okay be on a poker forum. It's like sending a raging alcoholic to a open bar. You would never do that because it's probably the worst spot you could be. Same with this situation.   Raging alcoholics don't lurk and contribute to /r/beer like cmon.   Edit: not bashing him, he should be honest with himself and he knows he sucks that's redundant. The whole post was about that, it doesn't matter if he sucks or not at this point, the whole point is that he shouldn't be posting here."

He lost his entire life and you come on and (idk if ur the same person or not - different name) say ""it doesn't matter what you would have done you would have ruined it.""

That's like telling my alcoholic friend to come meet me at the bar to tell him what a good job of staying away from alcohol he's done.   Not the place for this type of posts, im sure he hears good job good work etc from people in his GA. He should be avoiding places like this at all costs.   Next thing you know he's going to see a post of a sick graph of somebody's and start playing again and punting away his life he has gotten back together.   This is also a terrible post for the game and new players who want to play poker. Not everybody is a massive degenerate like this guy. It's okay to take $100 and maybe lose it playing online every two weeks if you can afford it, one to have fun with and two to learn the game.   Just because you start to play poker doesn't make you a degenerate. This post is actually the nut worst post that could be posted here on a place where we should be PROMOTING the game and it's growth and not scaring people away."

poker,3diq8l,OMGLUCKBOX,10,Thu Jul 16 19:58:34 2015 UTC,Yeah and saying he would go play live at the casino with $2k in one day and punt it all. $2k is actually a decent bankroll size for $1/$2 because the players are so awful. You must still be delusional to think that it was only bankroll management. Obvs terrible at poker no questions asked.   TLDR shoulda folded pre bruh.
poker,3diq8l,pokerscars,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:31 2015 UTC,"You are assuming he played 1/2 but he never said that. He said he was taking shots so he was probably playing higher, at a level he was nowhere near rolled for."

You have never chased losses or taken a shot way above your head? You are really so self disciplined and removed from the gambling aspect of poker that you couldn't possibly understand the mindset of gambler? Not being able to understand the mindset of a an addict like OP is surely a leak in game.  Knowing that an action is minus life ev and not taking this action are two entirely different things. I'm sure that everyone, including you, has experienced this paradox to some degree.  In your post you attack op like he deserved to have his life destroyed saying that he is ""the type of person"" that this would happen to and that he is ""giving poker a bad name"". That's an unfounded assumption, for all we know in an alternative universe where poker doesn't exist OP is happily married to his fiancee. How much can we really blame him for being swindled by a game that is basically designed to foster addiction and delusion?  OP knows he fucked up so he made a post to share his experience. Let's be honest, that vast majority of poker players lose money and r/poker has 35k subscribers. Do you think all 35k are winning poker players? ""give poker a bad name"" lol this may be true but it's a well deserved name... there are 100's of stories like op's for every success."

Some of the smartest people on this planet are fucking crazy addicts, but addiction trumps smarts, it's like trying to stop a hetero from seeking the opposite sex or trying to turn a gay person straight, or trying to turn a degen gambler into a BRM pro.   There are people like that the OP in all walks of life, video games, drugs and what not, it's up to society to realize this and not ban the stuff or ""give x_topic"" a bad name. Only a small percentage of drug users are addicts, the same with alcohol and gamblers.   Of course it's also historical, during terrible periods in history such as war and bad economic times, the rates of addiction sky rocket, but that's completely environmental. There's the famous study of soldier's in vietnam who were addicted to heroin, but where 95% of them were able to quit the habit when returning home, thus showing the addiction was 100% environmental for 95/100 soldiers.  http://jamesclear.com/heroin-habits"

poker,3diq8l,wolter99,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"This is why its important to start at the micros. When I first deposited I was playing 25nl and just assumed I could beat it because I watched a few videos on 3betting and knew what my preflop stats should be. After losing a bankroll I decided to play from 2nl to make sure I was actually beating each limit before moving up. This was in 2010-11 and it took me like a year to get back to 25nl and as soon as I did black friday happened.  As for OP, bad bankroll management is really common. There are a few now highstakes 2p2ers who I know have flipped for their entire bankrolls when tilted. Even phil galfond put like his entire bankroll (maybe half) on the table at once to play phil fucking ivey heads up in like 2006 or something.

poker,3dn0tx,Yuanfen91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't hate the bet after looking at it for a longer period it is a very difficult spot, bet less and every draw sticks around, bet more you get shoved on by strong draws, sets, two pairs etc. Much more difficult than on first inspection. I really think you can get away from the hand after the multiple shoves though, but even then it isn't a terrible call depending on how those players play as you might end up against multiple draw hands and be a favorite a lot of the time and you are calling 60 into what is now a pretty monster pot. This all depends on how these players play though and I'd expect overpairs, pairs + flush draws and two pairs to show up quite a lot in that spot.  This is why I hate JJ sometimes. After looking at it for a long ass time I think you played it alright even though I would have folded against most tables."

I find it hard to believe that you would just instantly shut it down like that. There has to be a bet of some kind in there. I mean, you can't assume that everyone behind you is going to have the hands that they do.  Then again, if you check, then the set is going to definitely bet on a flush draw board. The nut and second nut flush draws are going to call (or raise) and you fold anyway.  But, the shove, re-shove, and call...Instant fold.  When the action gets back to you, what do you think you are up against? I would have to think one of the three has a set. 89 2 pair at the absolute complete worst. I don't think all three of those players donk off with straight and flush draws."

If it went heads up to the flop and a player jammed over you you could consider calling.   just look at the equity if you're against a FD w/ overs. Obviously it would be a call given the money in the pot so HU I can see calling but multiway its definitely a fold http://i.gyazo.com/2d373607f6b8d6f89724a6ca6e8283b8.png
poker,3dlw5w,ElGofre,4,Fri Jul 17 09:30:18 2015 UTC,Ok...so just to be sure.  You deposited £10 and ran it up to £25 (now at a little over £20)...you received $16 in bonuses but you haven't used that at all. You now want to withdraw the original £10 plus £10 of winnings from that leaving the $16 of bonuses in your account?  If that is correct then Stars customer service is wrong...I would agree with their take on it if you have only played once or twice or with part of the bonus amount but I can't see that anything you are doing should be against any sites T&Cs. Unless you have at some point got your deposit and the bonuses mixed up.  Ultimately though it's all over £20...is it really worth that level of hassle?...and (this isn't meant to be rude in anyway) if you are that strapped for cash should you be gambling online?   Hope that helps
poker,3dlw5w,cobwebscavern,3,Fri Jul 17 10:06:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Yep, that's pretty much it. I've done zero conversions of currency in an effort to ensure that I don't run into issues trying to withdraw the bonuses given, so that's definitely not the case. I've emailed them asking under exactly what conditions I'll be allowed to withdraw my money, so hopefully I'll get a definitive answer to work on.  I'm not normally strapped for cash and have a very clear divide between my disposable income and the money I need to support myself, the £10 I paid was just for fun, it's just been a long month between paydays so my disposable is starting to dry up. The £20 isn't an enormous issue, it's just the difference between going out for drinks with friends and going out for drinks with friends twice :)"
poker,3dlw5w,cobwebscavern,2,Fri Jul 17 10:16:31 2015 UTC,One thought has just come up - It is possible that they may restrict the withdrawal of an initial deposit which triggers bonuses to stop people just making the deposit to get the bonus then withdrawing the cash...so you may have to play through the original £10 stake a minimum amount of times or length of time.
poker,3dlw5w,cobwebscavern,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:58:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't got my laptop so I can't check my exact game history, but I'm 99% sure I've staked more than the initial value of the deposit in tournaments, and have definitely done so when including cash games."
poker,3dlw5w,Geo_Hon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:34:00 2015 UTC,At work so no way of checking the T&Cs on this but I know that one bookies makes you play through a stake 10 times before you can withdraw it again if that releases any bonuses.  Possible that you might be coming up against this - frustrating I know but I hope you get it sorted.

Edit: Simply put thank you for the advice. After reading all the comments there seems to be a patter, too passive, need to push villain off the hand. Thank you!"
poker,3dm8fb,ekoostikmartin,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's good you see your mistake.   Obviously, in this specific hand, villain would have kept raising until you were both all in since he flopped an inside straight. But how often do people flop a straight with one-gappers? Less than 1% I'm sure.  And even that possibility you take into consideration with your decisions: if he has the only two cards that beat you, there's still a half-decent chance you get a suck out with a paired board.  If you have a monster but you lose to a bigger monster, that's usually bad luck rather than a bad play."

poker,3dm8fb,alien_infiltrator429,3,Fri Jul 17 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"The turn helps no one. Villain checks, so I think free card when he wants a flush or has a straight sure.   So let's say he has a flush draw, which is possible. He checks to you. You have to bet to make him pay for that draw. If the river comes and he misses the flush, he most likely won't pay you off (unless he improved to some big pair or better). In addition to flush draws, he can also have many straight draws (AJ, KJ, QJ, TJ, T9, 89). All of those hands will likely pay something to see the river.   As everyone else mentioned, smooth calling the flop with your stack is a mistake, but ignoring that. On the turn, you have to bet with the plan of calling if raised all in. You stack is so awkward on the turn that it makes it hard to get full value (all in) if he has a draw. So you probably have to be around $30-$35 and hope he calls with a draw.   This is a good example of how making a mistake earlier in the hand can end up costing you money. Of course you were able to get all in and win by the river, but his range of hands was much wider than the nut straight on the flop, and a lot of inferior hands would call a raise on the flop and/or a bet on the turn."
poker,3dm8fb,Proteus010,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"Ok perfect. If I think he has a straight or flush draw make him pay for it. Is that also to get a read on what he has? Thank you for the thought out response, really appreciate it."
poker,3dm8fb,ljump12,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"Is that also to get a read on what he has?    It is generally not a good idea to bet/raise to get a read on someone or ""see where you are"". The reason for this is that a lot of hands you bet/raise will only fold out worse hands and be called/raised by better hands (and sometimes bluffs) that will force you to fold your mediocre hands. This is a bad result because your opponent would effectively play perfectly against you.   Now, the above doesn't apply to your situation because you don't have a mediocre hand. By raising the flop, you certainly will fold out a lot of worse hands (because all hands but J9 are worse than yours), but there are so many hands he could have in his range that would call that are inferior to your hand.  So the reason you should have raised the flop and bet the turn is to get value (more money) from his inferior hands that will call a raise/bet.   Also, I should add, that you are not deep stacked. So it is much more difficult to narrow someone's range with a short stack because a bet and a raise is basically all in or pot commits you. So even if you did narrow him down to exactly J9, by then it would be very unlikely for you to have any chips left in your stack, let alone enough chips to warrant a fold given the pot odds you would be getting on the last bet."

poker,3dm8fb,Four_Months,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"With only 60 BBs I would be raising the flop and getting it all in on the turn. No reason to smooth call and check back, you are too short.   I'd also be wishing I had topped off my stack before I flop top set and get action on it."

I feel we're too high up in our range to fold, I mean sure we can have 66, 67s, 33, 44, 55, but we could also have 77+ for value.

It kills me when you say   ""I know 4-betting kings is reasonable but I like to play a lot of small pots and I have position, so I felt fine just calling here.""   Dude, you have the 2nd nuts pre flop, but its a hand that can get messy post flop. We are deepstacked to 150bb, so our 4b ranges should be opening up. It doesn't matter that you 'like' keeping it in small pots, its a deeper cash game, small ball doesn't work with this many bb, and 'feeling fine' about it is naive, and a losing strategy. Think if the roles were reversed, and  BB has AK. We are losing a SHITLOAD of value, and villain plays his hand more profitably than us, making us lose longterm. Until you get huge sample and sick reads, AA and KK should always be in your 4b range. Everything else after this play stems from this choice in the decision tree."

You're super safe from 77-QQ drawing out on you, and stack sizes are such that we can still try and get stacks in by the river.

poker,3dlmg6,Biggestnacho,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:53:04 2015 UTC,I can but it will be terrible :)  I very rarely play MTT's. I guess reviewing hands from the early stages when deep would be fine but reviewing anything that involved ICM considerations etc would be a total trainwreck lol
poker,3dlmg6,Biggestnacho,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:00:31 2015 UTC,"Hero (UTG): t13846         M = 26.37 UTG+1: t4950         M = 9.43 UTG+2: t3742         M = 7.13 MP1: t1675         M = 3.19 MP2: t5600       M = 10.67 CO: t12503       M = 23.82 BTN: t22036        M = 41.97 SB: t33597       M = 63.99 BB: t3940        M = 7.50    Pre Flop: (t525) Hero is UTG with A J Hero raises to t500, 2 folds, MP1 raises to t1650 all in, 2 folds, BTN calls t1650, 2 folds, Hero calls t1150    Flop: (t5475) A 4 2 (3 players - 1 is all in) Hero checks, BTN checks    Turn: (t5475) 7 (3 players - 1 is all in) Hero bets t1880, BTN calls t1880    River: (t9235) 9 (3 players - 1 is all in) Hero checks, BTN checks    No big ICM decisions. Thought process:  BTN is a pretty big fish, so I think I have an edge postflop. I call MP+1's shove since I believe BTN is calling super wide here and even if BTN is holding AK or AQ, I am getting decent pot odds.  Flop: I am opting for a check here giving BTN the option to bluff. I could also lead since I believe if BTN was holding 55-QQ with a heart he would call. What are your thoughts on this?  Turn: Betting here expecting to get called widely (do not think BTN is putting me on AX here). I think BTN would raise a better Ace here but he could be trapping too.  River: I am checking here since I do not think a worse hand will call if we bet. In hindsight though we could have probably bet around 2k and get called by a PP perhaps, although I'd expect a thinking player to understand that we'd be delaying a cbet with an Ace here."
poker,3dlmg6,Biggestnacho,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:15:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like the flop check. We're giving any heart a free shot at sucking out and the BTN maybe a fish but you haven't said whether he's a passive fish, aggro fish, or some other kind of fish.  On the turn, why do you think the villain would raise a better ace here after checking back the flop with it?  I think you have played the hand pretty moderately and I think your thought processes are off and also might be re-writing history a little.  Just bet the flop after deciding whether to stack off or fold should the button raise you and make life pretty simple for yourself."

poker,3dmrp8,SkeetRag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Good to know, I did call the river.   As for cbetting the flop I can't think of a reason other than to get him to fold his equity share (eg. hands like JTs, 9Ts) and 22-33 if he calls pre with those, but I guess overall a check is superior. If I had AKdd, would you recommend cbetting the flop with the intention of barreling diamonds and any T or J to put pressure on villain's medium pairs and Qx, or is a check still the best play? I could bet turn to get value from worse Ax (eg. Suited Ax and AJ), some Qx that villain checks flop with, and his draws (e.g. KJ, JT, and flush draws). But as Clarity pointed out, villain is betting most queens on flop and he'll bet worse aces himself. Also being a 3 bet pot, I wouldn't expect villain to have many XXcc combos here given he doesn't have the Ac."
poker,3dmrp8,ekoostikmartin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"JTs with a bdfd isn't folding here. Also, we don't care about their equity share, not with the best no pair hand on a dry board. We can and should be putting this in our delayed cb range  Worse A are going to bet twice for you, Qs will bet for protection, draws will be semi bluffing PLUS pure bluffs etc."

poker,3dlctl,JMY_3118,7,Fri Jul 17 05:11:41 2015 UTC,"You'll be used to the pc/laptop/mobile prompting you to play and giving you the usual bet sizings and options. This obv doesn't happen so do away with headphones etc. and focus on the game (at least to begin with).  Don't act out of turn....Number 1 mistake to be honest I see....so many online guys get used to not having to worry about this...don't sit waiting with your cards in your hand ready to throw away either. Wait till the action gets to you then make a movement...you can have decided to muck that 83o the second you seen it in the cut-off but just be patient.   A single chip (over the current bet) into a pot is a call regardless of size. 2nd biggest mistake lots of new players make so the best thing to do is to verbally announce all of your plays.   If you are unsure of anything ask the dealer - and don't worry about it...sometimes looking like a total noob can give you an unexpected edge.  Lastly, and this is just a personal tip, take warm clothing and some sweets or snacks. Air con can be on full tilt in some casinos and it can get chilly...you can always take off a jumper or hoody if you are warm but sitting there cold isn't fun. The sweets you can keep sugar levels and concentration up if playing for hours on end...and can be an icebreaker at a table sometimes :-)"

poker,3dlctl,odismoriar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:57 2015 UTC,"That's a solid, old-school live tip. You will, most likely, not be playing against people that have a firm grasp of identifying physical tells/reactions and by watching them look at their cards you might glean some useful information (especially against bad/new players). But, honestly, get to grips with the basics of playing live rather than worrying about this. You'll do great. GL HF!"

poker,3dlctl,airal3rt,0,Fri Jul 17 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"Don't do this shit. Nothing worse than a bunch of players who wait till the action is on them to slowly gather their cards, look at them, think, then act. It slows the game down and reducing the amount of hands you see per hour is bad."

poker,3dlctl,vethlock,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"Learn the etiquette and specific rules...   If a bet crosses the line you can't take it back. If you announce your action verbally it is binding (raise, call etc) when you put in a raise put the money in the pot with one motion, its best to just verbally announce the amount you want to bet Pay attention. Don't slow down the action. Protect your cards, if your cards are sitting out in front of you the dealer might think you have folded and grab them. Keep them close to your stack and put a chip on top of them.   Don't bring more than you are willing to lose.... I'm sure you are ok at NLHE, but don't overestimate your skills. The typical players at live 1/2 NL are very bad, just play a solid tight game and you should have an edge."
poker,3dlctl,Is-idiot,2,Fri Jul 17 07:05:40 2015 UTC,"All good points so far, I'd like to add a few observations: -opening sizes are much bigger at 1/2 live. Don't be surprised to see a standard open be ten to fifteen dollars.  -there will most likely be a lot of middle aged men limp/calling any two cards. Play tight and aggressive and keep bluffing to a minimum until you get a good handle on the game.  -if it folds around to you in the SB you can ""chop"" with the BB. I usually always offer to chop regardless of my hand strength.  -wait until the action is on you to look at your cards.  -have fun! Live poker is great if you're a social guy like me."

Guy won a couple pots and the dealer saw nothing for it. Finally we told the guy about the tipping etiquette and he started throwing $5 tips on $20 pots.  With that said don't go crazy tipping the dealer, your ""typical 20% tip"" doesn't apply in poker lol. My rule of thumb is for every $50 in the pot I tip the dealer $1."

poker,3djmnw,Q____,2,Thu Jul 16 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"I think Daniel would have check called safer flops but,  with his stack, he couldn't afford to have flush cards or straight cards come off.  If that happens, he either has to fold to pressure or call off his chips on a very scary board where he could be drawing dead.   Check shoving is probably his preferred play because his hand is most likely best and the are a lot of bad turn cards."
poker,3djmnw,MathW,2,Thu Jul 16 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"Your concerns about turn cards are very real, but it doesn't mean that against such wide range the fear of bad outcomes makes the call decision worse than a CR/AI decision. Generally, most profitable line should be preferred in poker, not the least scary one."
poker,3djmnw,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:01:10 2015 UTC,"Generally, I agree.  I think it may be a bit different in a tournament situation where you're committing most or all of your chips in a hand.   It leaves you vulnerable to being outplayed"
poker,3djmnw,Jack_Payback,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:20:09 2015 UTC,"Right. I think this was the right play. With a board like that you can't afford to give out free cards.

poker,3djmnw,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:01 2015 UTC,I don't think calling the shove was incorrect with his hand.  He was just a bit under 50 50 otf.  The only way calling would be incorrect is if Daniel had a J in his hand to share his straight outs (ruling out a flopped straight or set)

poker,3djmnw,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"It means that you play your hand in such a way that your opponent knows you cannot hold more than a certain hand strength.   Example: a tight player raises UTG and the flop comes all low cards.   It's very unlikely the tight player has better than 1 pair.   That being said, I'm not really sure how it applies to this hand as Daniel can have a wide range defending his BB and Mcheehan is calling the flop X-r with his strong draw even if Negreanu's range includes some sets or straights."

Daniel said he had been preferring to play post flop against Mckeehen and had been doing it effectively and nearly doubling his stack chipping up. Was shoving preflop more +ev? I would say definitely in a vacuum. But this isn't in a vacuum, it's with 11 people left in the ME at a table table with the 4 other shortest stacks that's getting absolutely destroyed by the overwhelming chip leader (that isn't going to make preflop mistakes) with no one else playing back at him while the other table is stalling. Flatting this hand went perfectly in line with DN's plan that was working well. Picking apart the EV of this hand is one the most common mistakes players make."
poker,3djmnw,Furples,5,Fri Jul 17 03:59:00 2015 UTC,"Picking apart the EV of this hand is one the most common mistakes players make.   If shoving is more $EV, I'm not quite sure why you think he should flat. The idea that DNegs wanted to see flops and outplay people post flop doesn't really make much sense when he is 16bb deep. I'm not saying shoving isn't more +EV, but your argument doesn't make sense. You should always base your decisions on EV unless there are significant risk tolerance decisions. These don't really apply to Daniel because he's playing to win and the money isn't life changing"
poker,3djmnw,Ozzyo520,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:35 2015 UTC,Well it makes perfect sense because that's what DN said

poker,3dls5m,lettis,3,Fri Jul 17 08:30:20 2015 UTC,"Sammy's range is capped (no JJ or AA) where as Tom's range still has these hands. Sammy is also likely to play his nut flush more aggressively on the turn, possibly even C/R 66 to deny equity to 4-card flush hands and gutshots that Tom can have.   By the river, Tom can jam JJ, AA, 66, nut flushes and then total sicko air balls, but Sammy only has 66 in his boat range (he's not calling hands like J3, 63 pre flop, and A3 wouldn't raise flop.   Probably the biggest tell at the end though was where Sammy defensively picked up his big chips to try and intimidate Tom into not making a huge bet - not what you want to do against a super-sicko who will pile in 400k with 7-high if he has good reasons for it."

poker,3dik2t,Tiltboy,-4,Thu Jul 16 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"This is the perfect example of why you shouldn't play hands like 35 in a 4 bet pot. Even in the rare times you hit this hard, you still lose.   Did you have a read on villain? Did you establish an image? Did you just feel like making a move? I'm just curious why this hand is all.   My range pre is AK and JJ+ on V in a 4bet pot. His modest 4bet doesn't look like he's trying to get stacks in but he wants to rep strength. So no, not AA. He min 4bet you and until I get a read on villain, I assume everyone would try to get as much money in pre with AA, hell even KK.   On the flop, you both check? Someone has JJ. No way AA-QQ checks this flop.   On the turn, he just flats after checking? Monster alert.   River he all the sudden ERUPTS with strength. Why? He's not bluffing, ever. ZOMG I HAVE QUADS(or MAYBE AJ) IF I DON'T BET HE CHECKS AND I LOSE VALUE ALL IN HE THINKS IT'S A BLUFF!!  There is no way it's a bluff and no, he wouldn't turn QQ-AA into a bluff on the river. No way he's playing something like A3 or J3 unless you both went crazy at the same time.   Its very very easy to say having seen the cards but yea, JJ. Unless he's the type to turn his AA into a bluff but that's read dependent.   He put YOU on AA and played accordingly.  Youre dead 100% of the time the way the action played out on a readless villain."

You hit a perfect flop for your hand against his range then you check it?   Lead the flop. The flat call on the turn should have told you were dead. The shove on the river was even more apparent.  If you didn't flop trips then what? Check fold?   Just a mess from start to finish.   Im curious why the spew here though."

Yea, you were stuck flatting a 4bet and showing weakness with a weak hand.   You have KK or AA, you repop. MAYBE you were planning to rep QQ on the flop? What is your plan going into the flop? Other than praying to flop trips.    I checked flop to protect my range and to let his overcards catch up,    I guess....You were forced into flatting a 4 bet and what, now you try to trap AK? Lol  You should be betting this flop every time. Unless he has JJ you're golden. You DO NOT want to see anymore big cards.    and I called river because I had a full house.   This is the problem. You thought you hit a strong hand with donk cards. You had bottom full house and calling an all in. Not valuing.   What on earth does he donk shove the river with other than a monster?    I agree it's pretty much impossible for him to be bluffing, however given that AA could conceivably be in his range it would seem silly to fold.    Why on earth would villain turn AA into a bluff on the river? Why wouldn't he value it?    Your comments about preflop 4bet sizing are absurd.   You should never have been in this hand much less 3betting and flatting a 4bet.   Unless you have a read on villain as some pro balancing his 4 bet range sizes or whatever, then the min 4bet SCREAMS JJ-KK.  AA almost always 4bets more there. Unless you think he's trying to invite calls with AA to see a mulitway pot   In my eyes it looks like a weak 4bet to try and induce folds while trying to rep strength and too allow himself to fold if he gets re-popped."

Hope to rep whatever high card hits and hope he doesn't have one? You're going to fold when he leads into you? What?   But you choose to flat because you have to at this point with ATC. What are you repping? AK? JJ-AA?   If you have AA, why are you just flatting my 4 bet and not trying to GII? If he had AA, why is he just min 4betting me and not maximizing value?   Ok, so you flat your 35 and see a flop.  GIN! Unless he has JJ you're golden. Why aren't you betting this flop? You think he's going to put you on a 3 here? You think he's going to fold this flop if he has AA?   You both check however....Why would he check with AA and lose value here? He obviously doesn't have a 3 in his range does he?   Ok, so the turn comes and the board pairs. You lead out and he just flats. Why? What's he just flating with?   Then, for no reason he just shoves into you with an obvious spew. Why?  What does this that you beat? QQ? No....AA? MAYBE? AJ? Possible. JJ? Ding ding ding.  He does the same thing in the 99 v AA hand.

Youre CALLING off your stack in a spot with no villain reads and where absolutely no one bluffs like this enough(at 2/5 anyway) to be correct long term.   I feel, you'd agree with me. I might not know the exact numbers but you aren't catching enough bluffs to make this a long term profitable call.

Stop flatting 4bets pre with weak hands. Stop checking flops, when you hit gin with those weak hands and stop calling off you stack on the river in spots where NO ONE bluffs enough.  You beat nothing but 66 and 66 is never in his range. Its ONLY AA and KK here.   Again, you're dead 100% of the time here."

Sure and 25NLz and 50NLz running 4BI under EV is just $100/$200 and is pretty standard but feel like puking at $2k under EV and it could be way worse.

poker,3dj7ch,robspeaks,3,Thu Jul 16 23:43:23 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between losing all your money and losing your bankroll though.  Especially if your bankroll is really small.  The idea that you can't play poker for anything more than pennies until you have $6k is silly.  You can play, you just have to set boundaries and live by them.  You lose your bankroll, you stop for a while until you have some extra cash.  Not everyone is an addict.  I mean, show me a poker pro that never lost his bankroll at one point."
poker,3dj7ch,robspeaks,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:00:59 2015 UTC,"True. I'm just saying if you want your best chance to NOT lose your bankroll (the money you play poker with), you have to follow those guidelines. To some people, losing all their poker money is no big deal and they just reload with the next paycheck. To some people, they end up pawning valuables, borrowing money from family and friends, if not stealing.  There are actually a LOT of poker pros that don't lose their bankroll - more who don't than those who do. Just because they may have lost their bankroll at some point in the past doesn't mean it was a good thing. Losing all your $ at poker is very bad and something we should all want to avoid forever.  I don't think the $6k bankroll is silly. When I started out, I didn't go straight to the casino. I practiced what I preached. I played home games for $0.05/$0.10 cent blinds and then moved it up to $0.25/$.025, and I remember feeling like $0.25/$0.50 cents was a big game - ""wow, I could very well win or lose a hundred bucks"" I thought. I still have 50 cent and a dollar games alternating with my $1/$2 game. It was a process. I had to graduate to being able to play higher games. It'll be a while before I have the live bankroll to play $2/$5 mostly because I don't get to play live often enough."
poker,3dj7ch,10J18R1A,0,Fri Jul 17 00:25:58 2015 UTC,"To some people, they end up pawning valuables, borrowing money from family and friends, if not stealing.   My issue is you're addressing this to everyone, but this deals with a tiny percentage of people.  Your average poker player is not someone who is on the verge of self-destruction except that they're in the green.   I don't think the $6k bankroll is silly.   It's not at all silly.  The part I'm taking issue with is insisting everyone must do it."
poker,3dj7ch,Four_Months,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not insisting everyone do it. In fact, I don't care at all who does it or does it. I'm just saying that IF a player wants to maximize their chances of not losing their bankroll, they need to follow bankroll management. It's an exercise for the reader to determine how important not losing their bankroll or IF they want to utilize these strategies or not.  And, although a small % of players are not on the verge of destruction, the MAJORITY of players ARE losing players and it would benefit such players to follow bankroll management if they aren't already."

True. But the nature of the problem is that other things push people off that path. You can understand responsible drinking/bankroll management, every rational reason behind it, and still have a problem. The problem rarely stems from lack of knowledge. Addiction is more rooted in the reasons the person is overindulging in something. Often, of you stop one addiction without properly addressing what's causing it, another will pop up. It's not wrong or bad what you're saying. It's just... Incidental to the heart of the matter."
poker,3dj7ch,nonfunnyasian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:52 2015 UTC,"In my post in the thread about the gambling problem I wrote:   I guess it's a question for someone much more qualified than me to hypothesize if a gambling problem is born because one doesn't follow bankroll management or if a person with a gambling problem inherently can't follow bankroll management for some reason. But, certainly if you don't follow bankroll management, you're going to go busto if you have a gambling problem or not. And, if you don't or can't follow bankroll management, then you may already have a problem or be on your way to having one.   So, I'm not making a comment about the secret of avoiding a gambling addiction per se. I'm just stressing its importance in a general sense."

But, they don't realize they're going to lose a few stacks with middle set to top set. Or, they're going to get their AA allin against 88 and get sucked out on or they're going to play bad sometimes or tilt or whatever.  It's like I said, if you're a winner, then there's no problem winning more buyins.

poker,3dj7ch,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:54 2015 UTC,I think there is a fundamental different way of thinking of the definition of a bankroll between a little kid playing for penny stakes with a $100 roll and occasional shot taking at live 1/2 vs. a person that is actually playing poker seriously and pretty much does not have the option of reloading if they bust.

For all the grinders grinding out 2nl with 30buyins, you're wasting your time. I think people are often not aggressive enough with their shot taking, especially when they are playing for fun and can redeposit/have a real source of income. Obviously if you never want to bust your poker deposit you should play very strict brm but if you have a decent real job you're wasting precious life grinding.   Also, 30buyins is really overkill for 1/2 live. First of all, most people don't bring their bankroll w/ them to a casino so they already have a stop loss. The people live really do suck and you can get away with 10buyins for 1/2 easily. Again, this is assuming you have a real source of income and will not be affected by the losses."

Flop was a bunch of faces and he and I checked it down. Turned out he had a smaller pocket pair. But another player,small stacked and not in the hand, started accusing he and I of colluding.

poker,3dlplc,dalonelybaptist,2,Fri Jul 17 09:16:36 2015 UTC,"I never did to begin with.  I had some interest when it looked like a big name had a chance of making it but now, I couldn't care less.  I used to love the old WSOP broadcasts on ESPN. I loved the way they showed all the day ones, all the crazy people, the bad players, the live pro's etc. It made good TV, way better than the way they do it now by starting at day 3 and trying to appeal more to the likes of us than casual viewers.  I will probably watch the ESPN shows when they start airing them but unless there are some interesting characters in the N9, I doubt I'll watch the live stream when it happens."
poker,3dlplc,RegiTime,2,Fri Jul 17 08:06:32 2015 UTC,"The problem is, the causal isn't watching it on tv anymore because they can't play online anymore. I knew so many people, my parents and their friends even, that played on stars.   When I joined the military my senior medic and his wife played. My ex wife's family hosted huge games and played online.   I loved it. Then it happened and everything went away. Now they have to target guys like us. We just need to legalize it and the casuals will start flowing again."

poker,3dlplc,RegiTime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Pierre Neuville win because it would probably be best for the game.  That being said, the November Nine concept needs to die (and probably will when ESPN's contract runs out with the WSOP). There is no sense in having a 3.5 month delay for a FT that will be filled by players largely unknown to casual followers/poker players.   The best proposal for fixing this IMO would be to start the Main Event in June (early to mid) and then having the FT come back at the end of the WSOP (so early July). No ridiculous delay and would still allow the press/WSOP to drum up interest (plus giving players preparation), particularly if a guy like DN or Phil Hellmuth were to make the FT."
poker,3dlplc,DenverLn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:42:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like that.   One of the big draws of the main event is that it's the last of a series of tournaments in which many participants played more than a few.   It should be everyone at or near the top of their game.   You can't hold the world series right after spring training ends.  I really do hate the 3.5 month wait.  Casual fans won't know who won anyway until it airs,  so there's no real reason to delay the playing until after the preliminary days air."
poker,3dk0uc,leathergiggle,6,Thu Jul 16 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what you're trying to represent with the turn check raise. But in a 15$ pub tourney that might not even matter.  Regardless when he calls you on the turn i would expect him to call the river if the board remains unchanged. The 2 hits on the river and since you almost never have a 2 in you're hand after check raising the turn I would expect him to call river. Furthermore after you jam river the pot is 89k and he only has to call 24k. I think he's gonna call here really often and you got really lucky that he folded. I just dont think this is a good bluff in the long run, but I mean it worked out so nice hand.

poker,3dk0uc,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:28 2015 UTC,Raise less pre or just fold all together. You have 28bbs so unless you're willing to commit all your chips with your hand a min-raise is fine. As played i hate the bluff attempt on the turn. You raise is not big enough. You were better off moving in on the turn rather then raising to 25k. Either way i don't like the move. I'd bet 4k pre if i decide to play. cbet 5 to 5.5k on the flop. Re-evaluate on the turn.

Not nice. Lead flop against this many people is suicide. Almost every K in the deck is better than you and almost every other hand folds. x/c is somewhat defensible. x/f is ok as well. fold turn immediately. He probably has 52o or some other stupid hand. Turn raises are almost always the nuts or something close to it.
poker,3dkywm,Sm_Jftwin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:05 2015 UTC,Agree with raise or fold pre. c/f is really bad. Betting like 1/3 pot is much better than your overbet sizing. When he raises 100bb do your really think you have a decision to make? You should have already mucked your hand before the villian's virtual chips had hit the felt.

But I've found that people really under defend vs river raises, so check raising rivers, cold 4betting pre especially from the bb and being comfortable 2 x potting river with a balanced rang have all helped the redline. Also when you are very agressive post flop people are more willing to give up pots to you on earlier streets because they know they're going to have to call a 2x river shove with top pair ok kicker. And when regs get sticky we just own them when we have our strongest hand by taking the same line I jammed 3x pot on the river with quads earlier today and got called by flopped tptk (second pair by river) in a single raised pot - all vs a reg."

poker,3dhsr3,SkeetRag,2,Thu Jul 16 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"I think we get a lot more flats to our b than you think. Most of his SCs should be calling, some suited 1gap BWs. I think our hand plays much easier in a 3b pot vs a flat, where it's hard to navigate through the streets to see our equity. We can also deny equity to Vs hands on a lot of boards, rep hands he can't, basically abuse our range advantage. If we don';t 3b TT, what do we, JJ+, AQ+, QK? Can't be correct.  Assuming players are generally inelastic with their draws 3handed as they assume they have more IO, we could have an exploitable ~pot size bet here, or even an overbet (especially if you already have overbet turns before, which is a neat tool to use). Snap folding river her, it sucks, but on review it should be pretty clear."
poker,3dhsr3,9betfold,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"I did some work on 3bet ranges mp v co - and am currently using roughly this - KK+, ATs, A5s-A4s, KJs, 87s, 76s, KQo, AhJd, AsJd (3.77%) and then I'm flatting this - QQ-22, AJs+, KQs, QJs, JTs, T9s, 98s, AQo+ (9.2%). But I actually think it could be way better, and you make some really good points about denying equity and being able to control the action ip with a strong hand and a stronger range vs his continues. I just didn't like the idea of 3bet folding TT (from GT perspective) and I don't want to be playing 4bet pots even ip with such a weak range, presuming I'm never flatting KK/AA to a 4bet. Which I arguably could."
poker,3dhsr3,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"3b folding TT is totally fine IMO, as the aggression of 4b bluffs that aren't at best flipping isn't there at micro->low stakes. IP flatting AA/KK vs a wide 3b is totally fine as well.   I think your 3b range is....interesting. I think you should have a malleable 3b range versus specific opponents. From a balance/gen pop perspective, I think MP is nearly as tight as EP, and A4/A5/78/76 don't need to be there. I think SCs play well enough IP even in MW pots, and the Awheel suited doesn't need to always be a 3b.   I think at these stakes, 3b a player with your range is fine if their MP is tight (<15%), fold to 3b too often, are fit/fold etc. If he's wide as RFI, KJs is a better flat, his 3b calling range is probably still too tight, things like that. We can sneak in hands into our flatting range that dominate his opening range, and he can assume we're weaker and his image is stronger."

poker,3dhsr3,kaellinn18,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"You are playing way too passively here, and villain is exploiting that. By flat calling villain's small probe bets, you are letting him draw out on you for very cheap in instances where you are likely ahead.  Hand 1: If you're raising pre-flop here, you need to make it bigger with a limper in front, as he's priced to call with practically anything to your 3x raise. As it ran, I probably fold the turn. The only good card for you on the river is an eight or queen; a jack/king just puts you in a difficult spot on a very coordinated board, and you'd most likely have to fold.  Hand 2: You need to pop it here pre-flop. QT against just the SB is a strong hand. You also should have raised on the flop. You've hit this board with 2nd pair and a good kicker with backdoor straight and flush draws. You need to find out where villain is at. Letting him probe bet with air (as stupid as it is with 68dd) let him runner runner you.  Hand 3: You need to raise his probe on the flop. You showed strength pre-flop by raising 4x, and that board isn't scary. You need to continue to represent a strong hand and not let villain take control of the hand with small probe bets from OOP.  Poker is about information. By flat calling these tiny bets, you gain no information from your opponent and allow him to outplay or outdraw you."

Maybe find a private company that offers some kind of shuttle service next.  Followed by public transportation like a bus or train.  UBER or some kind of share-a-ride company.  Then something like a taxi or renting a car depending on the distance, quickly getting more expensive until you get to chartering a private jet and private limo with complimentary drinks and hookers."

He's always been a beast but it's quite surreal to see him dominate the main event and to watch him battle and eventually eliminate negreanu.     Josh Beckley plays a bit on the regulated NJ sites and has started doing quite well in live tournaments this year. I've always thought he's very spewy but he has been crushing so I guess it works for him. Rather than whine after joe 4 outted him on the river for 4 million with about 50 left (Josh's AK vs Joe's AQ ran KJxxT), he simply kept grinding stayed focused and final tabled. Big props to him.   Thomas Cannuli plays as .BEAST. on the NJ sites and normally plays 2/4 3/6 and 5/10 cash, the biggest our state has to offer. He regularly battles against Greg Merson on there and Greg has acknowledged on his twitch stream that Thomas is one of his toughest opponents. He's recently (before the WSOP began) been playing all of the tournaments each night so I've played with him a bit. He's been one of the very few players on there who I feel I can 4b light without it simply being lighting money on fire. I was going to start joking with him that the cash games must have really been drying up for him to be playing so many MTTs, but maybe it was just some prep for the WSOP. Seems like it worked!    Some have said this might be one of the more boring line ups for the November 9 but for me personally it's far and away the most exciting. I do wish negreanu was there but I'd rather joe have his chips to be honest ;)"

Has Daniel done anything like this before (and if so, could you link other[s])?  One thing I didn't understand:   So the reason I chose to call with A4 rather than reraise was threefold:  1) It balances my calling range from the blind a little bit  2) I WILL get extra value post flop when I hit an Ace. He can't check an Ace  3) I avoid getting it all in preflop in spots where I will almost certainly be a 2-1 underdog when called   Isn't any ace a favourite against a majority of the hands that the chip leader had been opening?

My question is not about the equity I have against certain cards but more: are there more players at 2NLz who do this with junk or are there more that only do this with a more nutted range"
poker,3dknst,Clarityy,2,Fri Jul 17 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"You are right I shouldn't say ""his range"", let me explain though.  If your read on the population here is that they either have a range of KK+ OR AJ+ JJ+ then you can range them AJ+ JJ+ but put less weight on anything that's not KK+, now you have a range vs population and you call is still profitable.  My experience is that there's enough people at 2nl that just spazz out that AK is a never-fold. Sometimes you run into AA or KK and it sucks but calling >>>>>>>>> folding.  This holds true for any level btw, when people make a huge 4bet shove you can assume they are not a regular, therefore their range is wider than a nitreg's 4bet range."
poker,3dknst,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"The general rule is you will rarely be in bad shape AI preflop with AK since you block combos of AA and KK.  That being said, it is read dependent. ..some villains will never, ever 4 bet without QQ+.  Probably safe to fold vs those villains.  But I'm almost always calling vs most short stackers and loose players."

If so, x-c because I'd be terrified of 98 here and villain won't call a raise with one pair hands or bluffs.   We may miss value on villain's undersets, but I feel we would've seen more aggression somewhere in the hand if he had a set.       If villain is a spewtard, I might think about a X-r depending on reads and bet sizing."

poker,3dimz4,NDreader,3,Thu Jul 16 16:01:21 2015 UTC,I usually do this in most spots where the turn brings a scare card and your fold equity increases.  Usually I'll check back vs sticky opponents and realize my equity because we have no fold equity a lot of the time against them.   I'd rather not continue on a paired board because you're just bloating the pot and are going to value own yourself vs made hands that make boats on the turn. I would check back this spot and decide whether or not to call/raise the river if I get there or bet/fold the river just depending on the river card and villain.   Edit: spelling

As you played it, if we don't bet turn, we can't bluff out anything on any river. virtually all PPs should be calling, as the majority of your cb hands should be betting turn, and the hands that don't cb flop prob delay cb or have SDV and check it down."

poker,3dk9ni,MrMogz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:14:02 2015 UTC,I think i actually find a fold here. I'm trying to think of hands he could have that we beat. A10 with the ace of clubs i don't think he would call an utg raise. AQ with the ace of clubs is possible. A2/A4/AJ of clubs are all very possible. Could have played the hand funky and walked into a full house. I'm just not sure you're ahead here enough to justify a call.
poker,3dk9ni,krownroyal83,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"Pre - don't love the open, but fine if we have fish in the blinds.   Flop - Cb is fine, but a c/c can't be a big mistake. I think you're JJ-AA get 2 streets instead of 1-2 if they c/b/b, but cb is totally cool here. He can fold a lot of PPs and Ax.   Turn - No choice here with our exact hand. Call.   River - Pots ~21, he bets 15.5, and bets quickly. The snap IMO implies a fh far more than a nut flush, as the flush would still bet like this, but take a second. Secondly, we're actually really low in our range here that calls turn. We have many better flushes and some boats to be calling with, and don't need to be calling here. theoretically. Exploitatively, our hand isn't good here enough of the time to be +EV, or even 25% of the time. I would say in my head 'got there with 3s you fucker huh?' and fold."
poker,3dk9ni,SkeetRag,0,Thu Jul 16 23:59:57 2015 UTC,"BB was a fish, and I always open 45s+ even UTG ;)    I'm IP so how can I x/c flop?    with JJ-AA I prefer b/b/x or b/x/c to bluffcatch on this texture. Def betting OTF though."
poker,3dk9ni,SkeetRag,0,Fri Jul 17 00:05:34 2015 UTC,"Whoooops, thought it was bu. OK so checking back is fine here actually. I cannot imagine much FE on this texture vs a sb flat. Sure he has PPs that might just give up now, but this is all over his range IMO. We can pick up so many outs on a free turn. Also if we get c/r here....we what? Fold? Vs a set/2p/P+SD we have a decent chunk of equity we're giving up.   On turn, as played I stick to my previous answer, and river is exactly the same.   45s I would find hard to believe is more than a hair above BE even on 888 longterm, I think J9s, KTs are better to have in your utg range if you want it to be >15%.

poker,3di30b,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:50 2015 UTC,"When he donks for half pot on this wet-ish board I'm discarding sets as I believe they wouldn't use that sizing and are more likely to check raise considering I'm cbetting this board a lot.   Why wouldn't a set use that sizing? If you're going to donk to try and induce a raise from your set, half-pot seems sort of appropriate. I agree that it's highly unlikely he plays a set this way, but I wouldn't 'discard sets'. Discount, maybe, but not discard.   The turn card is sort of scary but his lead looks so weak    If you believe his lead to be weak, why would you minraise? I'm glad you see that it was a mistake, but you're missing out on some major value here by making just a pure garbage value raise - hell, you pretty much priced him in with anything he'd be betting with anyway. This is a pretty tough spot due to the turn card and the strange lead, but you've picked the worst option other than folding. Either cautiously call or raise a normal amount for value.  River looks fine."
poker,3di30b,RudolfKGB,0,Thu Jul 16 19:56:42 2015 UTC,6 hands isn't a sample to make any conclusions from. If you're going to raise turn raise more. Betting river is pretty standard.

Edit: You may have missed value on the river if he's on the flush draw. You miss out on giving him the opportunity to bluff the river with his missed flush assuming he had one. Looks like he did have a draw.
poker,3dk5y6,krownroyal83,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"I think you can make an argument either way. Villain seems like the guy that is going to look at any river and think its a good bluff card based on the runout already. Check-calling the turn lets you get 1 more bet in.   This board fucking sucks for villain unless they have a FD. But based on your read, they have ATC so let them continue to barrel."
poker,3dk5y6,maximum_wages,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah god damn I got too excited, just his turn sizing got me afraid that hes gonna just check back river (the dude used random sizing like 3x pot before) if I stacked him I would be on healthy chip lead deep into cash."
poker,3dk5y6,maximum_wages,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:06:13 2015 UTC,"Basically the hands V will call you with on the turn are FDs and PPs. He is probably calling PPs OTR anyway (even like 77-55 some times). And letting him see a free river gives him a chance to possibly catch up if he has an unmade hand. If he hits a flush, you get his stack. If he hits any card lower than an 8, you might get a call on a c/r. If he hits any card higher than an 8, you are getting more money. You have such a lockdown on the hand, villain is never drawing to more than 2 outs so you are worrying about nothing and have no need to protect.  You don't need to ""build a pot"" with players like this in this spot basically. Let him fire one more. I didn't go through the math, but he probably has around as many combos of PPs as FDs (unless you think villain is always betting overpairs huge) so the value trade there is essentially the same but you get the added value of a bunch of cards that make villain's hand OTR.  It looks like he might have ACTUALLY had a FD in this hand so the line you took was probably ideal based on his actual holdings but objectively looking at it from the turn, I would probably just let him bomb river for you."
poker,3dk5y6,maximum_wages,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with this, I got the hand lockdown basically or atleast im comfortably stacking off on any single river, I didnt raise cuz I was afraid of losing the hand just that I was afraid hes just gonna check back river.   Should of just let him take one more stab or possibly catch up with some overcards."

poker,3dk1kn,norcalknockout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:41 2015 UTC,"when it happens on the EPT they pause the tournament clock and bring out a man with a laptop with the chip cop and ICM numbers on it, then they discuss if everyone agrees and if everyone does then it's a deal, if they don't come to an agreement they carry on as normal"
poker,3dk1kn,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:18:10 2015 UTC,So EPT actually helps out and then does the payouts according to the chop so the players don't have to transfer money to each other?
poker,3dk1kn,norcalknockout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:20:26 2015 UTC,"I think that's how it works, someone might be able to correct me though"
poker,3dk1kn,norcalknockout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"I would assume this is correct.  I've never cashed an EPT so I don't know 100% but if they have a tournament director come out and help the players discuss a chop, with the ICM/Chip numbers, then they must adjust the payouts after.  No way would they do all that then expect the players to transfer money around."
poker,3dk1kn,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"That seems way better than all the chop situations I've dealt with. Last time I chopped we were 3 handed and I took a couple of extra seconds when the action came to me because we were talking about a chop and the dealer told me to act; it was really odd. Wouldn't you think they want us to chop, then they all get out of there earlier. It felt like they were anti-chop."
poker,3dk1kn,norcalknockout,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:37:22 2015 UTC,Yeah that seems pretty weird.  Especially for a tournament where the rake/fees were paid before hand and no one is tipping the dealers each hand.  It would be better for the casino to get it over quicker so they didn't have to pay the dealers.
poker,3dk1kn,cobwebscavern,2,Thu Jul 16 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"Can confirm 100% that this is how the EPT do it...The TD comes out with a laptop with an excel spreadsheet loaded up with variants (ICM, Chip Chop) and the players remaining will hammer out a suitable arrangment while the clock is paused.   Further the players are allowed to bring one person from the rail into the table area to help with discussions and to act as runners to make sure that any backers or people with stakes are satisfied with any chops as well.  TBH it doesn't impact on the TV spectacle of the thing as well...normally there will be some cash left over from the chop that they play for along with the trophy itself."
poker,3dk1kn,Joeboard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:24:52 2015 UTC,Agreed to a chop walk outside the room?  The casino doesn't chop it for you?  Most casinos I've played at will adjust the payouts when a chop is agreed upon and pay everyone out equal.
poker,3dhx4w,myimportantthoughts,6,Thu Jul 16 12:23:15 2015 UTC,"You've laid out the reasons to 3-bet quite well. I won't belabor those. Let's look at the reasons not to.  One reason not to 3-bet is that you'll be up against a tighter calling range. Particularly with broadway hands like QJs and KTo, 3-betting allows the BTN to correctly fold worse hands and continue with better ones. If you just flat, he'll still have his super wide opening range which you'll do better against.  Another factor is how much your opponent 4-bets. Your 3-bet range should change depending on whether he folds to 3-bets a lot, flats them a lot, or 4-bets them a lot.  The question to ask yourself is, do you want to have a polarized 3-betting range (strong and weak hands) or a merged one (strong and medium hands)? The answer to that depends on how your opponent reacts to 3-bets, so there's no one correct answer. A polarized range is good for when your opponent tends to 4-bet or fold more often than flat.  And one other factor to consider is how your opponent plays postflop. If he barrels a lot when you call his raises, it may be more profitable to let him keep the initiative. 3-betting will take away many of his bluffing opportunities, meaning you'll be forcing him to play more correctly.  These are reasons to potentially not 3-bet. You gave reasons to 3-bet. How you weigh all of these factors, that's for you to decide."
poker,3dhx4w,jkugelman,6,Thu Jul 16 13:55:48 2015 UTC,You had me at belabor.
poker,3dhx4w,SkeetRag,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is a really helpful comment.   In the games I am playing people tend not to be 4-betting very often without QQ+ or AK, and I have seen several people flat AK or QQ. I think perhaps because most players are not 3-betting very wide for value everyone thinks a 3-bet is much stronger than it actually is (particularly because there are no HUDs). So they are very wary of 4-betting say JJ and having someone snap rip it in and then they are just in a disgusting spot where vs the average player at these stakes they are facing maybe QQ+ and AK.  So given that flatting is much more common than 4-betting I guess I prefer 3betting merged on that basis.  There are some regs who will play back though, and we get into spots where we are 3betting each other lots so I am 4b bluffing them. Possibly the endgame is that I am 3betting A5s intending to 5b jam but no-one is anywhere near aggressive to do that yet. But I think a lot of fun players and bad regs can't even contemplate 4-betting with the intention of folding to a jam."

Against BU open I'm 3-betting about every hand you mentioned, though I don't like to 3betting low PPs 2-8 and I have 67, 78 and JT in my range as well.

But you shouldn't need to explain why he is an idiot.  Thats why I sometimes leave 1 word comments and shit.  But this is kinda more complex than that I guess.  We're basically either wasting a ton of hands we can flat with by folding them, or isolating a ton of hands we can flat with vs a stronger range that dominates us.

There are 4 players under 10bb and 2 under 5bb. You are putting yourself in a really vulnerable spot getting into this pot with big stack.   Also you shouldn't semi bluff at a micro SNG in this ICM at all. Lol @ villain calling you with a fucking 2nd nut flush draw.  Save yourself a blind and let the short stackers blind out before you start making moves.

With a flop like that I'm ahead of so much, and him being quite aggressive felt I could take the pot post flop.

I had AKss in the BB. an EP raised to 16, two callers behind him, I raise to 45 and two of the three called for a 3 way pot.   Flop comes Q47 two spades. I lead for 60-70ish and one folded, button raised all in for like 120 and I called. He tabled QQ immediately and I tabled my hand. I'm silently shouting for a spade as the dealer runs the turn and River, but no such luck.   Dealer pushes pot to the button and as he is scooping the cards one guy to my left says ""didn't you hit the running straight?"" I know the turn was a J but I couldn't recall the river, because it was a red card that disgusted me. Everyone else at the table disagreed with the guy who ""saw my straight"" but the dealer called the floor anyway who asked me if I wanted them to check the cameras. On the off chance that I just flushed $400 to this other dude I said sure, check em quick. other player and I weren't allowed to play a hand until the results were phoned in.   20 minutes later. sure enough, River was a T and I (and almost everyone else apparently) missed the straight. He had to forfeit the pot to me and I felt awkward. Other player's only gripe was to be allowed to keep $10 because that is what he tipped the dealer which I deemed fair."
poker,3dh7hl,brangd0n,2,Thu Jul 16 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"Wow the dealer must've gotten rid of the board really quick. Also never heard of a casino being that quick checking the cameras, usually they take so damn long."
poker,3dh7hl,ImKingDuff,2,Thu Jul 16 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"You have an ethical obligation as a player to ensure that the correct player receive the pot, after a showdown when both hands have been tabled, provided that you notice the mistake in progress.  If you see the dealer calling out the wrong winning hand, and you notice it, you must correct the dealer."
poker,3dh7hl,BobLeBoeuf,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:27 2015 UTC,1) do you say anything? when?  2) wtf   lol
poker,3dh7hl,only_poker,3,Fri Jul 17 00:08:53 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with calling a hand that's been tabled.  I'd say something when the dealer starts pushing the pot incorrectly.
poker,3dh7hl,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:52:24 2015 UTC,"No ethics about it. Mistakes can be made by anyone at any level. The dealer has allowed the mistake and misread (I presume) by Villian2 to colour his reading of the hand and made him think Villian1 is the winner.  The only people who are doing anything technically ""wrong"" are the people who are saying nothing. The instant you think something is up you should just say ""wait"" or ""hold on"" and ask for the hand to be looked at again....the point to say something would be the instant chips start to be pushed towards the player that lost the hand."
poker,3dh7hl,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:58:18 2015 UTC,I think you misread the board or V2's hand or something because this situation doesn't sound realistic. V2 clearly called because of NFD. If he hits it it's not like he won't notice.

poker,3dh7hl,BerryGuns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:59:42 2015 UTC,Because he saw the players reaction and knew he wouldn't react that way with the nuts (right?) so he assumed the other guy won.
poker,3dh7hl,bluehat9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:58 2015 UTC,Honestly the fact that no one spoke up and the dealer somehow didn't notice leads me to believe that it's way more likely OP just misread the hand.

poker,3dhiy8,theo29,2,Thu Jul 16 09:10:54 2015 UTC,"Copying comment from another I made:  1/2 is literally flipping cards, don't bother.   1/3 is playable, if you go to /r/chipporn, you'll see some big scores from people who play 1/3 at crown.   2/4 is when the game really starts having action without the crazy swings associated with short stacks and big take. There are still a lot of gamblers and degen regs, this is my preferred stake.  5/5 is basically 2/4 but with bigger stakes. I've taken a shot or two there, and I believe the game actually becomes easier considering the stupid amount of action it sees. A guy I played with at 2/4 moved up to 5/5, average player, bumped into him a few months back, and apparently was crushing.  5/10+ I've never played, but you see all the regs play there. Occasionally you'll see Joe Haschem on the main floor playing the highest stake, interested in playing him, no doubt would lose, but would be cool playing a pro."

Pretty varied demographic of players, genuinely skilled TAG players are rare but will be found, lots of degen regs who you see there EVERY week but like to see a lot of flops with rubbish hole cards, there's usually one or two nits per table who play a hand once per hour but will have the absolute nuts when they do. Of course you come across the occasional person who's wandered over from Blackjack etc who has no idea what they are doing and will spew off a buyin or two in less than an hour.   It's pretty soft really, it's only the BRUTAL rake they somehow jacked up even more that makes it hard to beat."

I've known a couple of friends to go for SNE at different points (and have made ~10k betting against them) and the toughest thing seems to be living up to goals.  You said    Roughly 7hours of grinding on an avg day, 10hrs doing the 5/7 days a week method.   Which obv on paper is very doable.  But have you stress tested yourself to see if that's realistic?  50 hours a week 8 tabling zoom sounds tough...how many weeks this year have you done that?  Plus you've got to remember that there will probably be a few weeks where you'll have to do 60-70 hours.  Can you do that without needing a break (since you'd need to bust out 60 hours and then still need to do 7 hr/day every day from then on)?"
poker,3dfgjp,d0nkjake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"I can actually grind super hard. Given I'm 31% to the goal after 55% of the year, I was at university  / playing 50nl max for jan-march or so. Then April is when 100nl kicked off, then May 200nl etc. Finished with uni around here then got on the grind for real. Did 100k VPPs in May and I could definitely go harder than that."
poker,3dfgjp,Thant0s,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kind of what I'm talking about.  Can you do what you did in May, 125% as hard, for every single month left in this year?  Have you considered going to 2p2 and offering a prop bet?  Since you stream, you're used to playing on cam and if you are willing to do maintain even splits between 100nl and 200nl AND have a must-profit pre-rb clause I'm sure you can get some action at a decent price."
poker,3dfgjp,Thant0s,3,Wed Jul 15 23:19:22 2015 UTC,"I think so. Month by month since March I've grown so fast as a player in so many ways. I'm confident I'll be playing 500nlz and 200nlz by Oct which will sky rockets my VPPs and I'll get it no problem.   2p2 prop bet - I'm not interested.... I don't even know if I will return to streaming tbh. Right now the brand of poker I'm playing isn't something I want to showcase. For me streaming was never the goal, it was just something fun on the side. Right now the grind is so serious and legit I'm focussing so hard I can't give commentary as I play. Plus there's a lot of spots I'm weak in now as I change my play style. Before I was playing very exploitable poker, way too aggro. Great to watch, loads and loads of sick bluffs, some really smart and awesome overbet spots. But I'm having to tone down the street poker and start playing super solid and tough to beat.  I think the prop bet is too much pressure for now, plus I don't have enough money back to put a decent stake up this very second. If I was gonna prop bet I'd want like $5k-$20k on it."

poker,3dfcuy,dispelthemyth,9,Fri Jul 17 11:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty casual online MTT player. I've read enough books and listened to enough podcasts that I'm not the worst player at the table at any given time, but I don't dedicate a ton of time to poker. That being said, I take it seriously enough to have PT4 and to follow a semi-strict BRM rule of 1-2% BI.  I once ran my BR on Stars up to ~$450, then binked a $5 PSKO 90-man SNG and got it up to a little over $600.  A few days later, I logged back in and headed to the MTT tab and decided to move my buyin max cursor to $13 (2% BR). Sure enough, there's this $12.50 SKO that had began about 5 minutes ago. I thought about it for a minute and figured ""ah fuck it, why not"" and registered. After the first hand, I notice my HUD isn't working then remembered that I'm a microstake nit bitch who only bought the light version of PT4 - ah well, I'll play this HUDless, no big deal.  2nd hand: Dealt KJhh UTG+1. Raise to 2.5bb. Guy to my left (UTG+2? MP-1? I don't fucking know) 3bets to like 7bb. BTN calls, SB calls, I call (pot odds, etc).  FLOP: 9h Jc 4h.  I lead for 1/3 pot (something something blocker, something something build the pot). PF 3bet guy raises to 3x my bet. BTN folds, SB folds. I flat.  TURN: x  I check, he shoves. I tank for like 15 seconds then tell all my instincts that this guy has QQ+ to fuck off - call. He just barely has me covered. Villain shows TcTs. Pokerstars' fancy new % feature tells me I'm a 98% favourite. I smirk and lean back and think about how soft the low stakes are and how I can crush them - 80% ITM, 6000% ROI over a large sample size is likely completely doable.  RIVER: Td.  I close down Stars. I shut down my laptop. I go take a cold shower. This must have been a sign that I should stay in the microstakes because the low stakes world is a cruel, cruel one that I don't want to be a part of. I return a week later to the microstakes where my HUD works."

I have read poker strategy till my eyes bleed, I follow hand analysis on here well enough and I can construct accurate ranges.  I have a game that works well live, but I cannot translate this into winning MTTs online.  I tried playing SNGs for literally a day but the format annoys me; I much prefer the small buy-in, big rewards thing.  I came out about even with the SNGs.  I would honestly consider putting down the online poker and take up live only if it were practical...  That, and the amount of hands you can get through online is staggering so it makes sense to practice.  It could be that losing MTTs so hard has made me a better live player.  I don't know...

Villain raised preflop and we both went all in after flop.   He turned over kings.  Turn and river both 2.  Was a live pot in AC ~ $1000.  Another rough beat in AC after I just gotten there after an hour and a half drive.  Played maybe 10 hands.  Flopped a set of 5s on a board of 5-6-7.  We go all in after Flop and turns over 8-4.  No help of course.  Lost $300 stack in about 10 minutes.  I'm sure I've had some others, especially online,  but these are my two worst live hands I can recall."

Pretty much the only flop where that hand is dead money because it double-counterfeits your lo and your hi is terrible. Fuck. Counterfeits.
poker,3dfcuy,asstheet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:18 2015 UTC,don't play plo8 a lot. but isn't that a good flop for your hand to at least take the low? do we always have to assume that the other players have the other ace and the low card since you already have two of them?
poker,3dfcuy,Backdo0r,2,Thu Jul 16 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"No because A5 is the wheel and A56 is the nut-nut. Technically, you don't even have a low. You need another low card just to have a bad low. If a 7 falls, your playing A2347,  which is shit and can even lose to randoms. So you have no Hi and even if you're heads up, the hi might scoop you with danglers on accident."

poker,3dfcuy,dios87,2,Thu Jul 16 01:49:20 2015 UTC,"Deposited $300 onto 888 about 6 months ago.  After about 20 hours of play had run it up to $1000 multitabling .50/1 nl.  So I login for my next session and queue up several tables and see some loose play and get ready for another winning session.  I remember I had doubled up at two tables and had about $100 on each of those and close to $50 on the rest.  Within twenty minutes, by the same user on two diff tables, my bigger stacks we're eliminated. -$200(net -$100)  Both times we flopped or turned two pair and I had the better kicker and he sucked out and hit a boat on the river.  5% happened twice in 20 minutes.   Needless to say that put me on heavy tilt.  Both times he bad garbage hands... i forget exactly but it would be like j-5 off against a-j flop aj5 turn k river 5.  Both times it was like this and I just remember it really messed with my mind.  I immediately just thought it was shady and thought it was an employee of their site.  The horrible run I went on for the next few hours trying to get it back just crushed me.  Ended up finishing the night at around $150 or so.  I quit playing for a long time out of spite and bitterness.  I tried withdrawing for a while and kept having issues. Eventually I started again I relocated for a job and haven't been able to get on since (888 new Jersey only).  I was able to get it back up to about $270 or so.  I hate online poker."

Now, being worried about being caught gambling with a fake ID is another matter and I don't know the consequences so I won't comment.     I say if you are bankrolled for the game, have good discipline and bankroll management, and think the chances of being caught are small, then go for it.   These young 21 year old pros taking down tournaments a few months after their 21st birthday didn't get good overnight.  They've probably been playing a few years."
poker,3df5gp,myfistyourholes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way: If you lived in say, Australia, you would legally be allowed to gamble. I think you're fine. I suspect if you get caught, you wouldn't have huge consequences. You also wouldn't have to say how much you've won over time."
poker,3df5gp,WiceMan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:45:50 2015 UTC,That would literally the worst thing ever. I'd kill myself if I won a bad beat underage.
poker,3df5gp,TheSuperSucker,7,Thu Jul 16 06:41:51 2015 UTC,Just become Jerome and tell the truth when you of age. Go on to be one of the best poker players ever.  Easy
poker,3df5gp,PLIKITYPLAK,6,Wed Jul 15 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"As a poker dealer, I'll just say this: you may have gotten by with the fake ID for now, but every time you play you are putting people's jobs and livelihoods at risk. You're young, you might be going to college or something, you have options. But if you get caught, then one, two, or more people who have spent years building their careers in the gaming industry have their worlds turned upside down because you couldn't wait two more years to play poker in a casino legally.   If you're concerned about not understanding the consequences of your gambling, there's a big one. And that one doesn't just affect you."
poker,3df5gp,Geo_Hon,3,Thu Jul 16 00:32:10 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate more on this? This was the kind of answer I was looking for but I don't think I understand. Who would I be hurting and how?
poker,3df5gp,TheSuperSucker,3,Thu Jul 16 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"What he is saying is that one or more persons may get fired if you get caught.  People who work in the casinos are usually doing it as a career, and since those skills don't easily transfer to other industries, if they get fired they will have a hard time finding another job at the same level of pay elsewhere.  That is what he means about the lack of options."
poker,3df5gp,lettis,2,Thu Jul 16 02:16:39 2015 UTC,People who work at the casino could be reprimanded for allowing you to slip under the radar for so long.
poker,3df5gp,TheSuperSucker,2,Thu Jul 16 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"Every casino employee that interacts with you is responsible for making sure you're of legal gambling age, whether they actually check your ID or not. So even if your ID has been checked and you've been given a casino wristband, if I deal you even one hand of poker and then it's discovered that you're underage, I will most likely get fired."
poker,3df5gp,lettis,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"bullshit, its not a dealers job to check ID, no dealer EVER checks ID, it isn't even in the training of a dealer to be able to spot a fake ID.  security staff check ID at the entrance and they rotate their positions, sometimes they are on enterance sometimes they are on other duties, so he will litterally run into 100's of different security staff at the enterance who have all let him in with the fake ID.  ontop of that if your suggesting every dealer who deals to an underage person will lose their job then he could litteraly play a hand of black jack at dozens of tables, a spin a roullete and get the whole fucking casino fired.  the casino is NEVER going to fire 100's of people over it, not even one because everyone got fooled by it so its policy that needs to change somewhere with the security at the entrance."
poker,3df5gp,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Is it a bartender's job to check the ID of someone they're serving? Same thing. Bartenders and dealers would never get fired if they missed a fake ID, because you're right, we don't get trained to catch fakes. But we have to check.   I'm not talking about hundreds of people getting fired, I'm talking about the three or four people that interact with the kid. I'm not saying that the casino would check the tapes of EVERY time the kid was in the casino and all those people would be fired, but every time he's in the casino people's jobs are being put at risk."
poker,3df5gp,WorstVillain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about what he said, thats retarded, your not going to get anyone in trouble.  chances are you will have your fake ID checked by 100 different security guards, anyone of them could have picked it out but didn't.  your not going to get dealers in trouble because i know you are not stupid enough to ever tell a dealer or EVER speak to ANYONE about your age anywhere near a casino."
poker,3df5gp,jvfricke,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:37 2015 UTC,if you have the cash then move up i dont see the issue
poker,3df5gp,xCoM24,2,Wed Jul 15 20:20:15 2015 UTC,If you have to ask - the answer is no. It is probably a bad idea to play underage especially if this is a casino you would want to play in when you turn 21. You get caught and they will take away your ability to play even when you are of legal age.
poker,3df5gp,xCoM24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:00 2015 UTC,In my experience this is almost universally not true.

poker,3dgbmw,earth159,4,Thu Jul 16 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Seems fine as played to me. Villain should have a lot of pair + open ended or weaker overpairs here. When he has a set or 2 pair or the nuts it sucks but we can't lay this hand down unless we have some reads on villain

They can make you make a tough decision for all your chips by either raising this flop or floating and bet/raising scare cards.  Since this flop hits a lot of his 3 bet calling range -- such as medium pocket pairs or suited connectors, you shouldn't be thrilled about getting it in."

poker,3dgjyq,LawNorderSVU,2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:38 2015 UTC,You play your best 5 card hand. So in that case the board shows 8833x. So you would play your best 5 card hand. If player 1 has Ace King and player 2 has jack 10 ace king would win the pot. He would play 8833A and player 2 would play 8833J.

poker,3dcu36,MathW,6,Wed Jul 15 17:00:44 2015 UTC,That's not his style when he has enough chips to play with..for better or worse...
poker,3dcu36,UndecidedMN,7,Wed Jul 15 07:15:19 2015 UTC,"He was probably afraid he would be called with anything and it was only a min raise and he was in BB.  Wanted max equity if he shoved, got it but got unlucky.  GG"
poker,3dcu36,Smoulder,15,Wed Jul 15 11:33:27 2015 UTC,"Given how wide McKeehan has been playing, his range was ATC, so I doubt he would be calling too much, he has been folding to all shoves when he's opened.  Another reason McKeehan would not call a shove too wide is because he was milking the table brilliantly 5-handed with 4 short stacks. Keeping it that way instead of having a 10-man table with larger stacks would be super +EV."
poker,3dcu36,UndecidedMN,3,Wed Jul 15 07:17:11 2015 UTC,"True, but Negreanu had been playing him like that for the last two levels.  He was the only one fighting back."
poker,3dcu36,Smoulder,3,Wed Jul 15 07:20:44 2015 UTC,"Not commenting on his playing style, playing small ball well is what got him more money than what I'll make in 5 lifetimes. Just saying he would have got a fold a huge majority of the time."

Most case check-fold some random flop, only way takes pot safely is Ace high flop but very difficult getting value from opponent. Over-roll preflop shove is best play.  (Some Hyper-turbo people blind defense with Q6o type random hand and Q or 6 on board snap jam. It's okay line very shallow stack hard money-jump situation that's strong play I think. Not only preflop shove is best play. But this case still preflop shove is better)"

Seems like McKeehen would have called anyway, given how phat his draw was. Should he have shoved pre?  Also, the hand much earlier today where Daniel shoved with 88 against a 3-bet from the small blind seems like something to ponder. The 3-bet from the small blind seems like a squeeze play, and the SB called with AA, but one wonders if DN should have played it differently.  Anyway, RIP Daniel's WSOP run. He's the most likable player in poker. Sucks to bust 11th again."
poker,3dcu36,Stixx_27,2,Wed Jul 15 07:28:41 2015 UTC,"Q1: Nah, I don't think so.  I think McKeehen is gonna cbet on that board an incredibly high percentage of the time with most of his range here.  So he might as well check/shove allowing McKeehen to cbet with his air and then fold for a bigger chip up.  Given what McKeehen actually had it would have played out the same, but given how he was playing it seems higher +ev to x/shove from Dnegs side."
poker,3dcu36,anonymous7,3,Wed Jul 15 07:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, you gotta consider that dnegs is defending so wide, that flopping top pair here is actually very strong for him. Well worth a checkraise."

Ivey a guy who shys away from the limelight and Hellmuth, as good as he is, is kind of a sideshow. I think a lot of people were pinning their hopes Daniel to at least Final Table just because with the extra media attention, he could have brought some attention to the efforts to regulate online poker (really just Poker Stars) back to America again.  Poker - online and off, really does seem to be in a dark place without America and Daniel was the lone shining beacon."

poker,3dcu36,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:56:03 2015 UTC,"No seriously, it actually is believe it or not. Also, you definitely don't want to be value-betting if you don't think you hold the best hand-that would be considered a bluff, you see, a bluff! So I suppose to break it down as clear as crystal: you want to make decisions where you think your theoretical return is positive. So in the aforementioned hand where DN shipped it with top pair having the draw call him would actually not be considered a bad decision as his hand was favored, albeit not by much, to win. Had he shipped preflop, he most certainly would have won that hand, but unfortunately in poker you don't get to see your opponents cards. A lot of people don't realize this because when they watch it on TV they see everyone's cards at the table, which makes the decisions look pretty easy."

Even with a 300% advantage over the field, which is very, very generous, you would only expect to make the final 9 in a 6,000 player field approx. once every 200 tries.  So, a tournament pro could conceivably play in every Main Event for his entire life and never make the final table assuming the player fields stay this large.  To get this close and fall one card short must be similar to falling 1 yard short of winning the NFC or AFC championship game after playing a 15 year NFL career and never having been to a super bowl.  For example, let's say there are 179 players with at least 2 WSOP bracelets.   Of course, not all of them are still playing, but I think it's safe to say at least 100 of them play the main event on a regular basis. Only 1 (Negreanu) made the top 27 and none made the final table.  In 2014, none made the final table.  In 2013, only 1 made the final table (Tran).  In 2012, none.  So, in 4 years, there has been only 1 final table apperance at the main event from a multiple bracelet winner."

poker,3dcz4p,andorrak,4,Wed Jul 15 17:13:46 2015 UTC,Think about it. The amount of information about poker is huge. The fields are immensely larger. You honestly need to be great at the game along with having a great run good. One has to crack aces or better equities multiple times.

Chance of him missing the top 20 for 10 years in a row =  (5,960/6,000)10 = 93.5%.  So, chance of him making another top 20 run in the next 10 years is about 6.5% =(.  If he plays poker for at the same skill level for the next 40 years and the main event stays at 6,000 entrants, the chance of another top 20 run for him EVER is: 23.5%.  So, as much as I like Negreanu, it's possible we just witnessed a once in a lifetime run in the Main Event for him."

He would also benefit greatly if the table knows he is willing to call off so light. ..even if he loses the hand."
poker,3dcz4p,mike3904,4,Wed Jul 15 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"If you consider that the CL is raising literally ATC shoving 17bb here is fine, It's a valuable chip up. Especially with a hand that flops as badly as A4o."
poker,3dcz4p,Jacolini,3,Wed Jul 15 13:30:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's a valuable chip up.   I just don't think it's a play Negreanu uses very much with that stack size and those cards.  That style has gotten him to where he is, so no reason to abandon it.   It didn't work out this time but, instead of being results oriented, you could also say that he got his money in as a favorite and was one card away from almost a surefire final table appearance with a dangerous chip stack."
poker,3dcz4p,mike3904,2,Wed Jul 15 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"Calling is fine, not arguing any different. Shoving however is variance free money, which in this case is the bomb. You're right about being results orientated for sure."
poker,3dcz4p,Jacolini,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:42:26 2015 UTC,"Well, easy to call it variance free money when you know he has J4s, but no guarantee you get a fold and most of the stuff he'd be willing to call with has A4 in pretty bad shape...with the exception of something like KQ, 33 or a low Ax he may call with."

poker,3dh3va,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:07:23 2015 UTC,Definitely useful for reads but I think that you're relying on it too heavily if you think that means he will see a $7 raise the same as a $12 or $23 raise.

poker,3dh3va,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:07:15 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you planned to check raise the turn?    Not a huge fan of the river play.  Not that I'm particularly worried about AK here, but I think there is a lot more value to be gained by either betting out small on the river, or check-raising smaller.  This is entirely villain dependent though, and what you think you're possibly getting called with.  If you think villain spews here with QJ or any Ax then by all means get it in.  Other than that you're really only looking to get called by other boats, and of those which ones would likely have checked the turn based on your read of villain?  Betting out small on the river looks really stabby on that board after the lack of turn action, and a lot of weak hands will look you up for something like half pot.  Maybe even get a raise out of some hands villain thinks might be good, but would prefer not to go to showdown with.  I like the check too though.  I think you're typical lag is stabbing at this pot more often than not so it's not unreasonable to expect him to bet out there.  If you were to check raise to 7-8 villain's calling range is a whole lot wider.  The most likely hands calling the shove will probably shove after your check raise anyway.    Considering all the money ended up going in, and you felt the need to ask the question I'm guessing he flipped over AK.  I don't think you're getting away from that hand against a lag."
poker,3dh3va,Jojapa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:17:16 2015 UTC,Betting doesn't look very stabby. Wtf are we x/c flop that bets river as a bluff? Maybe we turn like Q8s or 99 into a bluff if we are even calling flop.

poker,3dh29m,peonpete,2,Thu Jul 16 09:38:00 2015 UTC,"This is one of the few situations where stakes and reads are largely irrelevant. Set over set on the flop is ~1% probability so you can almost ignore it.  Where a made flush, made straight or combo draw are possible, you only need to look at effective stack sizes.  Hitting the set on the flop gives you 35% to fill up a boat by the river.  You only need to think it through when villian jams more than 1.5x Pot (including your bet) - Anything less and you're getting pot odds to call even if you're behind a made straight or flush on the boat. Obviously straight flush draws are a problem, but the odds of you hitting your boat and Villian getting quads are not even worth thinking about.  Jamming more than 1.5x Pot as a re-raise to me looks very polarizing (top set, made straights, flushes on one hand, donk bets on 2pair, top pair, complete bluffs) and is the only scenario when you need a read."

poker,3dgdi9,yrbuttz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:19:53 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what those words mean :(  Edit* Actions per minute (APM) is a measurement of a player's load-handling capacity and is one of the metrics for judging player skill.  Ideally, APM includes only ""productive"" actions. APM may be artificially inflated by superfluous repetitive actions.  Concept In StarCraft, there is very little idle-time during a game where a player is inactive, so it is often advantageous to be able to perform actions faster than your opponent(s). Some strategies even focus on increasing the amount of things your opponent must do (usually by increasing the things he needs to respond to by attacking in multiple spots simultaneously).  6 tables is actually pretty ideal when I have a coffee or 2 in me, otherwise its 4. 4 I can comfortably fuck around with music and simply messaging/reddit, but really I think 6 and no distractions is probably better."

poker,3dhi8t,keNj1x,8,Thu Jul 16 09:00:55 2015 UTC,"Did I do anything wrong in this hand? Is there any reason for him to call my shove?   Hoo boy. So I actually think that the Russian guy made very few mistakes in this hand and that almost every single decision you made was not a good one.    I get dealt J10 in the big blind. Russian guy is UTG and raises to 18k( 2bb). Everyone folds and I call, thinking I have nice connectors and a cheap flop is always good.    You have 33BB and you're playing OOP against a guy with a wide range. JT is probably a fold here. I don't think it's a terrible call, but it's not a good one.    Flop comes Jh10d8s. Perfect, I hit two pair. I prey this guy has AA/KK. I check, he leads out half pot.    Deciding to check-raise is the best decision you made here. It's a good way to get value from overpairs as well as hands like AK/AQ that aren't going anywhere with two overs and a gutshot.   I tank for a bit and decide to raise two times his bet. He snap calls me.    Of course he does. You check-minraised. The pot is 100k and he has to call 20k more. He has correct odds to call with almost his entire range.    Turn is a 7c. I check, he bets half pot again and I decice to shove all in.    I don't understand this at all. You've already said he plays a wide range of weak hands so what on earth makes you think he wouldn't have A9, K9, Q9, J9, T9, 99, 98, 97?   He snap calls my all in and shows, wait for it.................... FUCKING POCKET 7    Yeah that makes sense. He's not folding a pair+gutshot on the flop getting 5-1. It's hardly a masterful play by him but in the game of who made fewer mistakes in this hand, he's winning.   (board: J1087) , GIVES EVERY 9 A STRAIGHT   Yes, so what were you hoping to achieve by check-raising all in with top two pair?   But the fact that I just witnessed the worst call in poker history made me fucking lose my shit.   If I've kept track of stacks/bets, he's calling around 180k into 480k? He's almost got correct odds to call with his set even if he puts you solely on 9x or Q9."

poker,3dhi8t,BillRQuinn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:47:52 2015 UTC,"So... Either you were bluffing, trying to get a set (which is a pretty narrow part of his range here, of all the things he could have a set is not very likely) to fold or you were trying to get a call from a hand worse than yours. If you were bluffing, well, that's a stupid place to bluff because most hands that have you beat are 100% calling (and given his call, literally 100% of hands that had you beat are calling). If you were value betting, it bad because what could call that's worse than yours? A crying call from a worse 2 pair?"

poker,3dfqp8,simonhaze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:26 2015 UTC,In order to take a shot at 5NL you need about 20 buy-ins meaning $5 buy-in (max) x 20 = $100 bankroll same goes for 10NL.   $10 buy-in (max) x 20 = $200 bankroll.  Keep this in mind if you lose 5 buy-in's drop down to a lower stake. Example: 10NL (-50) = $50 bankroll drop down to 2NL or 5NL so you can make the money back up.  Good luck at the tables!

poker,3dfay7,DASoulWarden,3,Thu Jul 16 18:56:48 2015 UTC,Live plays much bigger. Raising 5x the BB and having 4 or more people call is common so you get these bloated pots and there can be a lot of money to be made if you can run well or play well.
poker,3dfay7,myfistyourholes,4,Thu Jul 16 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"I mainly play 20/40 limit holdem, my hourly last year was 35+ /hour.

poker,3dfay7,nobazn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:48 2015 UTC,< 1BB/hr is pretty low for a live limit game.  @ 40 I'd expect to be making $60-80/hr at least.  Are there not that many games going so 40 is the highest game in the room?  Have you tried dropping down to softer games and seeing if your hourly is higher there?

poker,3dfay7,nobazn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not following.  You said you made 35/hr @ 40, and I said that it seems like that win rate (.875BB/hr) seems low.  You then said that you didn't play enough hours to get a good sample size, but that you made 50k...which would be 1400 hours.  Seems like a decent enough sample."

poker,3dfay7,nobazn,-3,Thu Jul 16 07:43:02 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you live but for the most part, no one is making a living (paying rent, food, and supporting a family) solely from playing 1/2 or 1/3. It's pretty dubious at 2/5. The reason is that in MOST places the rake is too high and there aren't enough fishy players to donate.  Most of the players who DO make a living live in a place with a wide selection of games like LA or Vegas and they play higher than 2/5 and they play more games than just NLHE. One of limon's appearances on Bart's podcast, he mentions that he'd be starving the year he was doing the interview if his only game was hold'em because he was either down or a very small winner for the year and it the year was over half way complete.  Anyone can have a good weekend at a casino and claim $50 an hour at whatever stake, but to go play day in and day out and sustain a winrate live to pay the bills is not easy and not many players are actually doing it."
poker,3dfay7,clkou,2,Thu Jul 16 00:52:31 2015 UTC,You can live on 1/2 and 1/3. Its no lavish lifestyle but its doable.  There is a kid at my local casino who made 120k last year playing almost only 2/5. Im sure he ran a bit godly during that time and its not a huge sample size for live but that is nothing to scoff at.  A guy I play with regularly makes at least 40 an hour playing full time at 2/5. He doesn't even know any other games than NLHE.
poker,3dfay7,maximum_wages,2,Thu Jul 16 13:24:22 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to those guys and see how long they last. That's kind of the point that limon was making. There are periods where you run really hot, but how do these same players do when they run bad? How do they do when there's an economic downturn?  If 1/2 and 1/3 is doable, do you know anyone who has been doing it exclusively (not higher than 1/3) for 5 years plus?"
poker,3dfay7,clkou,2,Thu Jul 16 13:57:48 2015 UTC,"We aren't exactly in the middle of a huge poker boom or anything. And a run bad in live poker can suck, but you are rarely going to even have a losing month playing live.  If anyone is exclusively playing 1/2-1/3 for 5+ years, they need to move the fuck up, move to an area that offers 2/5, or fucking quit. No one does that because it isn't that hard to move up to 2/5."
poker,3dfay7,maximum_wages,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:04:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that most people move up but I don't think that's the only reason next to no one is actually doing it exclusively for 5 years or more. I think it would be much tougher to ""make a living"" at 1/2 or 1/3 due to the low stakes, high rake, and the bad luck and bad economy that will eventually do in a lot of players."

poker,3degwv,CleverFreddie,5,Wed Jul 15 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're calling here. His utg 3b calling range is going to be a lot of PPs and broadways, I like our check on turn, and on a brick river we have to assume nothing changed. To put him strictly on a flush seems too tight, as he could definitely value bet 88+ here, given the small sizing trying to get us to call with some weak hands. We cannot rule out fh's either, but I think given the price we're good often enough, as fish tend to bluff much smaller in sizing than their value size. Simply put I think if we had JJ it'd be different, but we're pretty high up in our range here.  *Edit, didn't realize there were 2 callers pre. I think having the first cold caller we can say his range is far less AXd, as he's prob 3b or fold A5dd and shit, i think it's far more PP heavy, and with the river sizing it seems unlikely he's vb a fh."
poker,3degwv,SkeetRag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"He's pretty loose, but yeh I really wasn't worried about sets, so I was only worried about the flush.   Can he value bet 88+? That was the range I was thinking legitimised a call, but I just wasn't sure he'd bet that. I think JJ+ are betting sometimes, so I'm only ahead of three hands. Then again, there really aren't many flushes that called either. Maybe as low as JTs. Which are actually less combo's, (18 vs 4) so maybe that's a good reason to call?"
poker,3degwv,Stixx_27,4,Wed Jul 15 18:02:46 2015 UTC,I think /u/skeetrag already nailed it already.  The only other thing I'd change is raising more pre.  There is already $1 in the pot from 1 raiser and 2 callers.  Raising to only $1.1 is far too small imo.

poker,3degwv,TSC2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:27:10 2015 UTC,No it's almost 4:1.  $8 into a pot of $30ish is just about 4:1 (~32/8).  But yeah I struggle with the light calls as well.

poker,3dgyio,chicomodo,3,Thu Jul 16 04:47:08 2015 UTC,"On the flop, with 9.5BB in the pot and an overpair on a wet board (diamond draw, 78, 8T, 89) and you're only betting 2.5BB into the pot? That's a mistake.   Here's why:  Villain either has:   a hand that crushes yours,  a hand which has significant equity a hand you beat but will call for value Nothing.    In the first case, your villian will almost certainly raise. Let's get back to that later.   In the second case, a hand that has significant equity - say, two diamond overcards, 87... you are giving him a very good price - 17% - or about 6-to-1, to call and draw.  You want to charge him to draw for two reasons: first, because you are ahead of most draws, and you want to get money into the pot when you're ahead.  The small bet doesn't get him to surrender his equity, doesn't get maximum value if you are ahead.  It is impossible for your opponent to make a mistake, because he simply calls with his draws, raises his monsters, and calls everything else.    In the third case, your opponent has a hand that will call for value, but which you beat - which will, ""pay you off"" in other words. TT, T9, A9 no diamonds.  In this case, you could certainly extract far more than 1/4 pot-size. Even 55 is probably calling there for 1/2 the pot, because it's more likely for you to have missed that flop as a UTG preflop raiser than for you to hit it.  (55 beats a lot of hands in that range, like AK/AQ high) So you're losing money when you have the best hand here.   In the fourth case, your opponent has nothing. A significant bet size would make it too expensive to try to bluff, as it is, if he reads your 2.5BB bet as weakness, he could try to bluff you, cheaply. If his but is a bluff, he's risking 6BB to win 12.5BB, meaning you only have to fold 1/3rd of the time for this to be a profitable bluff spot.  If you raise to, say 6BB, or 2/3rds the pot, his raise has to be a much larger committment of chips - meaning it's going to be more expensive for him to try that move, and you'd have to fold much more often.  Especially since you're not showing weakness by betting bigger on the flop, he's less likely to bluff, and just fold his nothings. You can win the pot here without showdown. Winning without showdown is great in tournaments, you can't get knocked out of a tournament on a hand without a showdown.   So, let's go back to the first case.  Your opponent might have you crushed with trip sixes.  (Let's assume for the moment that this guy will not slowplay trips on a wet board in a tourney.)  He's going to raise.  Now, because you bet small, there's a possibility that his raise could be a bluff, and since you're only being asked to call 3.5BB to win 21.5BB, you almost have to call based on pot-odds alone.  If you had bet a normal amount, say, 6BB, your opponent's raise would have been much larger, meaning not only that it was less likely that he was bluffing, but that it also tells you where you are in the hand (beat) and you can throw your hand away as the correct decision.    This small bet-sizing on the flop is almost certainly how you got into trouble with this hand.    On the turn, you're betting tiny again.  Why?  It gives you the same problems you had on the flop.  JJ is the 5th nuts here and likely the best hand, but an A/K/Q on the river could ruin it. Bet for value. Worse WILL call.    When your opponent raises you HUGE when the third 6 comes out, though, you have to be very wary.  It's rare for him to have a better hand here, but he's acting like he has it.  I think even the way you played this hand, you could easily find a fold at this point -- your opponent is putting his tournament life on the line with this hand.  If he's bluffing, that's a very good bluff.  Never be afraid to be bluffed off a hand. Sometimes you get bluffed. It happens."

poker,3dgyio,ivymikey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"Terminology. It goes limp, bet/raise, 3 bet 4 bet. Its impossible to 4 bet UTG unless it comes around again. You said you 4 bet and the next guy checked. Clearly, something is wrong with your story.  IMHO, best guess, you limped in or raised a tiny amount. Any decent, JJ bet should have gotten K6 to fold. Yeah, you lost to quads, but you shouldn't have.  Study on bet sizing and GL."

Compared to... Guan raising from early position.  McKeehen 3-bets -- already McKeehen has a stronger range than Hellmuth would need to open from late position.  Negreanu cold 4-bets from the BB.  Unless Negreanu is on a total bluff, there's very few hands he would do this with.  Especially compared to the Hellmuth hand where he could be defending his blind against a late position raise.  McKeehen...knowing Negreanu's range is very narrow, decides to 5-bet all in.  I can't imagine him doing this without KK, AA or AK.  And, Negreanu's AK is not doing very well against that specific range.   TL:DR:  Hellmuth's pushing range was much wider because Negreanu's range was much wider in that hand."

poker,3dbvb8,Protential,10,Wed Jul 15 02:52:40 2015 UTC,Passing on a +17% of pot edge requires a HUGE amount of ICM.   You're essentially asking if the ICM  large enough to pass on a $+400k $EV spot.
poker,3dbvb8,Hollow_Man_,5,Wed Jul 15 03:00:24 2015 UTC,Can you expand on this a little more whenever you get time? If you don't want to no worries. Just kinda confused and it seems like an interesting question.
poker,3dbvb8,Protential,3,Wed Jul 15 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yes icm matters, yes icm matters here, however icm matters differently based on a ton of factors. (I.e: why AA pre can be a fold pre flop in satties).  So while icm matters, passing on a 17% edge on total pot is a huge amount of equity to pass on and requires a fairly extreme amount of ICM."
poker,3dbvb8,Hollow_Man_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Okay worded like that makes some more sense. Guess I just didn't understand that % of pot edge/equity (is that much there) and relation to ICM or $EV, and still kind of don't but I'll take your word for it lol"
poker,3dbvb8,Protential,5,Wed Jul 15 03:34:23 2015 UTC,Knowing your CEV edge in a spot makes it a easy to guestimate your $EV edge and from there figure out whether it is a +EV decision based on ICM factors.

poker,3dbvb8,alchemist2,4,Wed Jul 15 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"You would really consider flatting the 3-bet from the BB, where we'll be out of position against one or two opponents?  Seems like an awfully tough spot to play from in the 2/3 of hands when we miss the flop."
poker,3dbvb8,Protential,7,Wed Jul 15 03:40:23 2015 UTC,Yes.   Sometimes you have to make good tough decisions to play the best poker.  If you didn't have to make tough decisions the game would be ez.
poker,3dbvb8,alchemist2,2,Wed Jul 15 03:44:51 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  I guess I just don't have enough experience to play that situation well postflop.  Here's how it would usually play out for me:  I flat the 3-bet with AK in the BB.  (Say just one villain.)  Flop is J84r.  Check-bet-call.  Turn 7.  Check-bet-fold.  Pain.
poker,3dbvb8,jkugelman,6,Wed Jul 15 03:59:59 2015 UTC,"And that's fine. It's okay to fold to two barrels with no pair. It sucks to fold in a big pot with what was once a very strong hand, but good poker doesn't mean winning every pot. It also means folding when it is correct to fold. Sometimes a correct fold means you fold the best hand because ranges and stuff.  It may also be a mistake to fold. That's where the skill comes in, knowing which is which!"
poker,3dbvb8,MathW,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:10:00 2015 UTC,These are likely the same people who say he should've shoved his A4 preflop for the free chip up.   Poker sure is easy to play after you know your opponents future actions and holdings.  I bet I could win the WSOP every year if I knew how my opponents would react to all my actions.
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yea like this is a tourney thing I wasn't sure about, personally I think I like turning our nut blocker hand into a bluff expecting folds chunks where we pick up a lot of dead money"

poker,3dbvb8,BrentD22,3,Wed Jul 15 15:14:19 2015 UTC,Why cold 4 if your going to fold to a 5 bet?
poker,3dbvb8,anonymous7,3,Wed Jul 15 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"Villain went into the tank. There's a potential for a reads-based fold there.  Also, based on history, Negreanu could also know that the 5bet was unlikely, making the 4bet quite good."
poker,3dbvb8,petzergling,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"If i was to make this play its because I don't think it is a profitable flat pre.  Almost certainly he is going to want to have some hands in his cold 4b range here because he is oop and may want to get it in pre with some hands.  Given that he has some cold 4b value hands, hes also going to want some bluffs that he is 4b/folding.  If he thinks flatting out of the sb is not profitable here (ie: fold>call) than this will be a prime candidate for a hand to be 4betting as a bluff as we have blockers to premium hands and in the rare situations that we get called our hand will be extremely straightforward to play postflop.    Given that he tanked for minutes pre I'm guessing this wasnt the case.  I wonder how someone who has played as many years of professional poker as he has has questions about <50bb preflop decisions.  I'd guess he wasn't keeping full track of stack sizes until after his raise and either thought it would be an easy call or fold and when checking the count afterwords realized it was a much closer decision than he initially thought"
poker,3dbvb8,Stringdaddy27,3,Wed Jul 15 16:17:40 2015 UTC,This was about 30 minutes ago in the ME. Big fold with AK but I'm sure he felt confident he could find a better spot than that. Can't wait to see that hand televised.
poker,3dbvb8,Tiltboy,4,Wed Jul 15 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"3B -> 5B jam  Very strong line. I'd certainly write anything worse than Jacks off here. Daniel is repping a lot of strength, so to get reraised, he's almost always got AK in rough shape. I don't mind the fold, Daniel definitely understood the situation a lot better than any of us, so I think he made the right play."
poker,3dbvb8,inekarma,4,Wed Jul 15 05:07:19 2015 UTC,"Tough fold but a marginal spot for him I'm sure. Why risk 75% of your stack at this point in the game for what you HOPE is a coin flip at best? Fold. Wait for a better spot and hit the final table.   As others have stated, this is the perfect example of the differences between cash and tournament play."
poker,3dbvb8,MathW,2,Wed Jul 15 04:06:46 2015 UTC,"Well, he did wait, and it seems that he didn't get a better spot. You can't just think you'll get the same spot where you have AA when talking about less than 500 hands (until the ft). These are not fishes he's playing with, he can't really think he will get a major spew out of someone at some point."
poker,3dbvb8,inekarma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"So I'm sure if Negreanu could see the future and see he busted in 11th, he'd probably call.   Hell he'd probably do anything differently to avoid busting in 11th.  This is not the way to analyze a decision."
poker,3dbvb8,Tiltboy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"I wasn't analysing the situation. I was just saying that ""wait for a better spot"" is something that he should not be doing. As in, if he thinks it's a +EV call, he should do it, even though the variance is big, since the there isn't any huge fishes and the stacks are so small that even though he's better than the others, he's not going to get to take very big advantage of that. I'm not saying that the decision itself is bad, in fact, I think it's probably a good one since I don't think he's doing that with any other hand than AA or KK. But that's because it's a bad decision by itself, not because it's a good one (little bit +EV but folding would still be better).   Edit. I'm not criticising Negreanu at all, just the ""wait for a better spot"" which I think means folding in a spot that is +EV, but folding would be more +EV in long run."
poker,3dbvb8,inekarma,0,Wed Jul 15 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"When the decision is call of 75% of your stack and be crushed or coin flip at best, you wait.   Maybe a better spot doesn't come but no offense, I'm sure he knows better than you."
poker,3dbvb8,Furples,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that it was a bad decision. I'm just saying that waiting for a better spot is not necessarily the way to go when playing with small stacks and with good players,because you simply don't often get any better spots. I don't think it's possible to have any big edge in that game with that small stacks."
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:36:07 2015 UTC,If he accidentally tables 88 we have to call though
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,3,Wed Jul 15 11:42:55 2015 UTC,"It's probably fine, is basically a bluff pre but it's not like we can flat and we look so strong folding is prob fine, + AK has great blockers, obv he knows the dynamic better"
poker,3dbvb8,Irreversible_Rape,3,Wed Jul 15 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I hate to say it but in a tough decision like this do you think he's considering the value of reaching the FT? When I say that, I mean in terms of exposure, sponsorships, etc over the next 4 months. The difference of making the November 9 vs not is huge for him. Obviously he wants the bracelet but that has to be in the back of his mind."
poker,3dbvb8,jajison,3,Wed Jul 15 01:57:31 2015 UTC,Making the 9 is obv massive. There is still a long way to go though it's not that close to the bubble. I'm fairly sure he's made a good fold
poker,3dbvb8,thermobee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:04:16 2015 UTC,"Good fold. he's more than likely up against AA, KK, or QQ, I don't think he is 5 betting with anything worse than that so I think Negeanu is probably dominated there. We will see what he was holding on the espn broadcast I guess."
poker,3dbvb8,thermobee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"He must have put Daniel on a strong hand and wanted him to get it in. My guess is Matt also had AK. But that's just me, some guy that's never played a big tournament before."
poker,3dbvb8,Suckysucky5dollaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:59:41 2015 UTC,He does have one thing going on that none of those other guys have. And that's the fact the the money means absolutely nothing to him. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think only one of the other guys has any big cashes on his resume. He can play relaxed and go for the title.   That said he is short stack right now with 5 million.
poker,3dbvb8,gwo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:12:46 2015 UTC,I actually just took a look at the players cashes in WSOP/circuit events and McHeehn has the most with nearly 1.2 million in cashes to date. Everyone else has at least 1 cash in an event with ranging amounts. I'm on mobile or else I'd post more details.
poker,3dbvb8,Stickyballs96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:18:57 2015 UTC,Yeah thats what I found too. McHeehn is the only one with any significant cashes.

poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:14:00 2015 UTC,How could we know when we don't have any reads on him? Reads is what makes this decision a call or a fold.
poker,3dbvb8,Wavelet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:56:09 2015 UTC,i think this is a call honestly...he had so much invested with the 4 bet already... hes getting the correct odds
poker,3dbvb8,Protential,-3,Wed Jul 15 21:19:46 2015 UTC,75% of chips to gamble with a 50/50 to win against any PP and at worst the guy has KK or AA so I think it's better to wait considering he's good enough to pick another spot.. We've all been confident with AK only to lose to 44 over a flip ya know.. Then you look dumb for risking everything with ace high
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,2,Wed Jul 15 02:05:04 2015 UTC,"Is this a joke? Why is it upvoted so much? If the guy ever has anything worse than AA and KK it's a snap. It's a massive fold since we also block those 2 hands, we have 25% of the guys stack in the middle obviously if the guy flips 4s we have to call off..."
poker,3dbvb8,Cleis,6,Wed Jul 15 02:15:36 2015 UTC,"The poster above you analyzed it as a tournament player, where, given tournament dynamics, there are spots where you would gladly fold AK to 88.    You're analyzing it as a cash player, where, given that you have a 50/50 chance to win and you stand to win more than 2:1 (because you already have money in the pot), it's always +EV to call against 88.  Cash and tournament poker -- they really are different games."
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,5,Wed Jul 15 02:59:24 2015 UTC,The first guy was just wrong.
poker,3dbvb8,Cleis,3,Wed Jul 15 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"Look, I know for a fact we can't fold if the guy flips 88. It's basic poker, ICM clearly isn't a great enough factor to dictate a fold here. We have the guy covered and everything"
poker,3dbvb8,Protential,4,Wed Jul 15 03:02:08 2015 UTC,"protential said this exact same thing above, you're clearly correct. 2:1 is too good odds not to call vs a confirmed under pair. Everyone else is talking as if you're getting like 1.1:1 on your money which would make it a fine fold in a tourney if you have the skill edge of DNegs."
poker,3dbvb8,Spacezup,2,Wed Jul 15 10:14:24 2015 UTC,"Yea thanks, id agree if it was closer. Not sure why so many people in this sub feel like they need to just spew nonsense"
poker,3dbvb8,Hollow_Man_,4,Wed Jul 15 10:17:29 2015 UTC,I think it's because the basic logic of 'you can make folds in tournaments with a slight equity edge that you couldn't make in a cash game' is sound.   It's just wrong here.

Also, I feel like calling here even if you see the dude's cards and he has 88 or something can't be that good. I don't know exact details but I wanna say when this happen DNegs was like 8/15 and was still top 10 after that fold. If he loses he's in last or very close. I don't have any concrete numbers but even if you know for sure you're flipping it can't be that great, especially considering the jump in 2 places is like $110k and the jump 2 more after that is like $230k. Flipping there just feels bad to me based on instinct but I'd like to see some math with some more concrete details.   Also (math and strat aside), the balls it would take to call there knowing you're flipping would be pretty huge. But maybe that's just me being a pussy."
poker,3dbvb8,BerryGuns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"My one below says it's prob a good food because the guy prob folds anything worse than KK since we look so strong, it's a good hand to 4bet expecting folds a lot where we pick up lots of chips"

poker,3dbvb8,NihilisticToad,2,Wed Jul 15 02:55:13 2015 UTC,"If you feel that at worst he has AA or KK then it's certainly a fold. I think his range is JJ, QQ, KK, AA and AK. With that logic it's a call BUT in this specific situation with what's on the line I am folding. Regardless, I can't wait to see what the opponent had and hear what Negreanu said prior to folding because you know he's going to have a monologue."

Your chips:pot and then we look at the equity of your hand against an opponents range (or you could do it first). Let's say we have AK and the opponent has JJ and the pot is 10 million after his 5bet (4 bet, 3bet  whatever) and to call you have to put in 5 million to call and possibly win a pot of 15 million then it's a call based off that as it's a coin flip.

poker,3dbvb8,Irreversible_Rape,2,Wed Jul 15 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"uhh, because the 5 bet is for an extra 7+ million and would have crippled him to have called and been dominated"
poker,3dbvb8,lettis,2,Wed Jul 15 02:53:04 2015 UTC,"No, because blockers. AK reduces the number of combos of AA and KK you'll face. Also sometimes you get flatted and take a flop.  Just because you raise and fold to a re-raise doesn't mean your hand is a bluff."
poker,3dbvb8,jkugelman,0,Wed Jul 15 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"no because if Daniel was holding AA, KK he is calling. You really think that guy who started the hand with a healthy 10+ million would risk his tourney life on any two cards?  Be real"
poker,3dbvb8,lettis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:27:30 2015 UTC,"AK has two blockers so the likelihood the opponent has a big hand (AA-KK, AK) is much smaller than say if he did this with seven deuce.  When you have AK the likelihood villian has AA and KK is half than if you had seven deuce (6 combos each vs 3 combos) and AK is also just over half as likely (16 combos vs 9 combos). You block a ton of nutted value range hands when you have AK."

He was getting significant odds to call even though he likely has less than 50% equity against the shover's range.  The decision rests on Daniel's perception of his opponent's range. In a cash game there's no ICM so that weights it even more towards a call. Now maybe the villain's shoving range would also be tighter in a cash game. Who knows.  Don't pretend that poker is simple when it's not."
poker,3dbvb8,lettis,-3,Wed Jul 15 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"lol the only hands shoving over the top is going to be AK 22-AA  so at the very best your flipping, everything else your behind."

poker,3devai,UW81,3,Wed Jul 15 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"In live games, 1/2NL refers to the blinds. Min-Max buyins vary by location, but are usually 20-100BB.  Online, things like 2NL or 5NL referr to the maximum buyin, generally 100BB. So that makes 2NL .01/.02, and 5NL .02/.05.  'Stakes' going up, usually refer to blinds increasing in a tournament, or a kill pot increasing a tables' stakes. (Some 'kill' games increase blinds when a player wins two pots in a row. These games will always be marked as a '2/4 Kill' game.)"
poker,3devai,ComebackShane,2,Wed Jul 15 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"The confusion comes from the difference in terminology between live and online games. Live games have higher minimum stakes (casinos need it to be able to turn a profit running tables), whereas online stakes have low overhead per player, thus can run lower minimum stakes.  Live always has the x/y NL notation, where x= small blind and y = Big blind, so 1/2 NL is live no limit with $2 big blinds.  Online always has a xNL notation, where x = 100 x big blind, so 5NL is online no limit with $0.05 big blinds."

poker,3ddhak,kTmike,3,Wed Jul 15 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a dealer with 15 years in, and here's my take:  I think most dealers in that spot are only really concerned with who is going to tip the most from that pot. Of course, you feel bad if you do it to a regular, but the only people who will stop tipping you because of something like this are typically nits. All that usually happens in this spot is the player now greets you when you push with a ""here's my bad luck charm!"" and it allows that player a chance to share his bad beat story with the rest of the table."

Many poker dealers are former poker players who couldn't hack it, and there are some stereotypes of poker dealers that as a majority are true. If you would like me to get more in depth, I would be glad to.  I view the job differently than alot of my peers, I genuinely enjoy getting up and going to work everyday. I don't have a college degree, yet I make more than my parents ever have (granted, they are teachers). The work is grinding on your body, especially without proper posture. Back is always sore, fingers and wrists become very fragile, legs hurt from sitting so much. Let me know if you want a more in depth answer, but I have never regretted choosing the profession I did, because many of the people I deal to have worse jobs than I do and make less money."

poker,3ddhak,pie-oh,8,Wed Jul 15 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not real sure what to talk about. I've started writing little paragraphs as I keep telling everyone I'm going to write a book about my experiences, but I'll just give you a little insight.  I started dealing part time when I was 14 in a little VFW Hall (like a hangout spot for older war vets). I started playing poker here after I saw the 2002 WSOP coverage on ESPN. I played here for about 3 months, becoming a weekend regular. The reason I started dealing was because a pregnant lady was dealing and had to use the restroom, asked if anybody at the table would deal for a few hands, and I was the only one who chimed in. I had only dealt at the kitchen table, but felt like I could do it. I don't remember how bad I did, but I didn't fuck up too badly because the guy running the room asked me if I could come and deal on the weekends.  From the time I first started dealing poker, I knew it was for me. I was always a very shy kid in front of adults, but very outspoken amongst my friends. When I was dealing, it always just felt right. The instincts I never had in poker, I had in dealing. Knowing how to properly shuffle, how to pitch, how to pitch to exact spots, keeping the game moving without coming off as a money hungry asshole, knowing when to speak and when not to, it all just came very naturally to me.  How serious you choose to take your job is something only you can decide. I decided about 5 years ago that I was going to try to become the best poker dealer in the world. There is no way to quantify this, and I am sure I'm not, but it gave me something to strive for.   When I got my first casino job, I thought all that was important was speed. I still remember the time I dealt 32 hands at a 3/6 limit game. It was a table full of regulars, and the players there knew I was built for speed. They decided to keep the game moving at a frenetic pace in order to see how many hands I could get out. Everybody was moving the button, the 9 seat was dropping my tips, and everybody was having fun without it being a serious deal. That will always be a very fond memory for me, because poker dealers don't have much to strive for, so it becomes the little things.  Working in a casino can become a serious grind whether you love your job or not. As a dealer, it's hard to take vacations, because your income is based on tips. I'm fortunate enough to make minimum wage, but for most dealers, minimum wage is what is used to pay taxes. Most of time you have to work Fridays and Saturdays, and those are typically the worst days to make money. More tables = more dealers = more mouths to feed. Management can have a direct impact on the amount of money you make, and at times you WILL feel like they are picking on you, even though everybody must eat shit at one point or another.  You get to be your own boss though. There are not many jobs where your personality is a direct influence on your income. A quick-witted dealer can make just as much as the most efficient dealer in the room, it's alot about picking your spots. I don't know, there are so many miniature details about my job that I think aren't applicable to many other jobs, and I don't want to start rambling incoherently and with bad formatting."

There are entirely too many variables that go into the question, so I will give you a range. Full time dealers in my area range anywhere from $30K to $80K. The better (quicker, efficient, good customer service, better table manners, etc.) can only make so much, as you're limited by the amount of hands you can deal. The lower spectrum of dealers still make decent money just due to the nature of the tipping."

poker,3dekmu,timetosuckit,5,Wed Jul 15 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"If I raise pre-flop I C-bet (2/3 of pot) about 75% of the time. 90% of the time I cbet I take it down.   I'll lay you 10:1 that if you keep track of it over a reasonably long session, you'll find that your cbets are taking down pots much less than 90% of the time. (And if you really are getting everyone to fold that often, then you should be cbetting much closer to 100% of the time than to 75%.)  Frequencies aside, I totally get where you're coming from. It's rare to actually hit a big hand in hold 'em, so when it finally happens it can be tough to know how to proceed. And of course there's no one right answer on how to navigate these situations. Sometimes you'll want to fastplay for value, other times it will be better to check to give villains a chance to catch up. There are a lot of variable that go into these decisions, but IMO one of the biggest things is to consider the board texture and the preflop action.   If we have JJ as the preflop raiser and see a J72r flop heads up, that can be a good spot to slow play because (1) there aren't many hands in villain's preflop calling range that will want to call a big bet on this flop, and (2) it's very hard for villain to make a hand that beats us on a later street.  But if we have, say AQs in late position in a multiway pot vs and early position raiser and several callers in between, and the flop comes Ts8s5s I'm going to go ahead and fast play 100% of the time because there are a ton of hands that will call us on the flop, and there aren't a whole lot of ways for villains to improve to a worse hand that can pay us off. (Even if a 4th spade comes to give someone else a lower flush they'll still be hesitant to stack off.)"
poker,3dekmu,TheDigitalRuler,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:00:09 2015 UTC,this makes a lot of sense. Thank you for the response.
poker,3dekmu,SkeetRag,3,Wed Jul 15 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, this is so vague. Texture is a very complicated topic, and defined questions need to be asked about it. The nuts can have the V have a super narrow calling range, or it can be very wide. AhAd on A8s9s is different than As2s on 4s5sKs."
poker,3dekmu,SkeetRag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:46 2015 UTC,I know. I was afraid this was going to be the extent of responses to this question but I guess I was hoping to start a general discussion the matter.   What do you do when you flop top set on a non scary board?  What do you do when you flop nut flush?  Top boat?
poker,3dekmu,CleverFreddie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Again dude, texture is everything. AA on A23 is different than JJ on JT9ds than 66 on 623sss. You need to give specifics if you want actual answers. If anyhting, I wouldn't play again until you get more comfortable with postflop play, flop cb frequencies and 3b pots. At the very least drop down to 200nl.  I didn't downvote you, but I understand why, you're asking for clinical information on the the more complex part of the game."

poker,3dczen,Depolarizing,2,Wed Jul 15 08:25:41 2015 UTC,Any decent opponent will be cbetting so much that there really is no need to have flop lead out range.  The timing tells are obnoxious. If you take 5 seconds on every decision including preflop I'm not going to play you for a long session unless you suck. Expect rec players to get bored with you.   Only betting half pot is bad. You give them a good price to bluff catch and you let them off the hook instead of making fat value. Vary your bluff sizes. Experiment with overbets for value and as bluffs in spots where your opponent has a capped range.

poker,3d98a8,Furples,3,Tue Jul 14 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think you might be trolling, but this is an interesting point similar to what Colman discussed. Everyone loves DNegs because he's grown the game so much and therefore been a ""poker ambassador"". But by definition this means he has brought fish into the game that have lost money."
poker,3d98a8,AmericanYidGunner,5,Tue Jul 14 15:25:43 2015 UTC,Yeah and most of those fish had perfectly intact autonomy.  Do these people think this world view is profound or something?
poker,3d98a8,Furples,5,Tue Jul 14 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's profound. And I agree with you that people should take responsibility for their actions. If somebody sees DNegs win a bunch of money on TV, it's not DNeg's fault if that person gets caught up in a delusional poker endeavor that causes them to lose money. However, it is interesting to think that there is at least a decent bit of manipulation in terms of selling new players on the ""anyone can win"" mentality. It's obviously partially true, but at the end of the day, poker as an industry grows when delusional people think they can win money and usually fail"
poker,3d98a8,AmericanYidGunner,2,Tue Jul 14 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't think you were presenting it as profound.  I just mean people like Coleman who ship tens of millions and then go all white knight on us with some hippie idealistic world view that implies this false dichotomy of a poker community that is part helplessly mentally ill gambling addicts, and literally Hitlers who feed off of them.    When in reality, the vast majority of us are passing 3 digits around to each other to avoid talking to our girlfriend's or going outside."
poker,3d98a8,De-Trout-Spinners,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more about people saying ""DNeg winning will be good for poker"" as it if will have any effect on them. Yes it will be good for poker, but that means poker websites and a tiny fraction of poker players.  I want Daniel to win, but not because of some  ""good for poker"" STEM logicTM.

poker,3d98a8,hoopaholik91,3,Tue Jul 14 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"I don't get it either. I know there are a few people that get out of hand but for the most part people enjoy playing poker whether they win or lose, that's why they keep playing. To act like the world is a worse place because poker exists is a tough sell, and even if you manage that, you still have to consider the million other things that could be considered a 'detriment' to society."
poker,3d98a8,Infinitezen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:51 2015 UTC,"It's not that that tough a sell, in my opinion.  It's pure dog eat dog, every man for himself, and all that.   Walk into any poker room, in any casino in america, and look at the faces around you.  Most of them are not happy, self actualized people by any stretch of the imagination, they use poker to self medicate and entertain themselves but a lot of them are bitter as fuck.  Even the big winners are often stressed and addicted to action to such a degree that even if they wanted to leave the game and retire, they wouldn't be able to.    That said, there are good things about the game obviously.  But live casino poker is more often than not an exercise in the observation of human misery."

poker,3ddo6t,pokerinabox,4,Wed Jul 15 13:32:16 2015 UTC,GTO exists at every level. Should you be striving to play GTO at the micros? No. If you play on bovada where everyone is anonymous you should exploit population tendencies.
poker,3ddo6t,Clarityy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:40:52 2015 UTC,Could you show me that GTO strategy?  Maybe make two posts if you need to.  Thanks.
poker,3ddo6t,Four_Months,5,Wed Jul 15 13:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem let me just pull out my GTO machine.  Obviously no one can play exactly GTO, but at higher levels some people strive to play close to it when readless.  Now someone comes in and goes ""But GTO adjusts to your opponent so you should always play GTO!!"" and we can have a discussion about what GTO means and how that is different from what people mean when they say GTO etc etc, I can't wait."
poker,3ddo6t,Clarityy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:46:56 2015 UTC,Obviously no one can play exactly GTO   Obviously.
poker,3ddo6t,Four_Months,3,Wed Jul 15 15:43:05 2015 UTC,In a way learning about GTO etc will help you to realise exactly how the population deviates from it and is exploitable.
poker,3ddo6t,dalonelybaptist,2,Wed Jul 15 15:12:25 2015 UTC,Why not both?
poker,3ddo6t,SkeetRag,2,Wed Jul 15 13:41:15 2015 UTC,"In GTO videos (Sauce comes to mind), you often hear him say something like: if you keep doing X, your opponent can start to do Y. Well at the micros and especially anonymous, if you keep doing X, players won't be playing you long enough to notice and then do Y. Plus I'm not sure they're capable of figuring out what Y should be."
poker,3ddo6t,Four_Months,0,Wed Jul 15 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"if you keep doing X, your opponent can start to do Y.   Then X would not be a GTO strategy."
poker,3ddo6t,Sm_Jftwin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's my point. You can keep exploiting, using strategy X and players won't be able to adjust. So seems you don't need GTO."
poker,3ddo6t,gyom999,2,Wed Jul 15 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"No, don't even attempt to play GTO at the micros. You're at the micros, so first of all, you're not even sure what GTO is or how to play it. Secondly, the micros is basically a player pool of calling stations, meaning they don't care if you're balanced when you 3barrel x board or not."
poker,3ddo6t,Four_Months,2,Wed Jul 15 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"Poker is a game of information and adaptation.   When you play against good players, if you play in an exploitable way.. they will get this information and adapt their game to exploit you, until you adapt yourself.  But at the micros.. no matter how you play, 95% of the players won't adapt to you and they will just continue to get exploited. So you gain more money by playing in an exploitable way than trying to be GTO.  So for me, the best way to play at micros is exploit the shit out of bad players and don't try to get into a preflop pissing constest / cock mesuring war against other ""good"" players.. Or in an other way, exploit bad players and try to be close to GTO against good players, without overdoing it.."

poker,3ddo6t,SkeetRag,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"The majority of the players at the micros are not playing a game resembling poker as we know it.  Why would you try to employ a GTO strategy against a group of players who are essentially not playing the same game as you?  You don't have to concern yourself with being exploitable against players who are not trying to exploit you.  At the micros you should be focused on exploiting the tendencies of the weak players around you, and you don't need to understand much if anything about GTO to see what most of them are doing is just flat out bad."

A few that are necessary for me are using ""set to bet amount"" and then hitting the ""+"" to bet instead of ""Bet x amount"" as it helps cut down on misclicks since you have to confirm your action.  The others are the ""activate next"" and ""activate previous buttons"" as I feel I use these as much as anything else."

It's really important to just play your normal game and not think you need to play differently because it's the main.   One guy I talked to put it this way: You may think, ""Wow, these loose players accumulate so many chips. Maybe I should try what they're doing and play a lot more hands."" If you've been playing thousands of hours as a tight-aggressive player, you're not going to figure out how to play a loose style now. This is not the time to learn how. Just play your normal game."
poker,3d7krk,jkugelman,3,Tue Jul 14 04:03:54 2015 UTC,Exactly.  You come into a tourney with a certain skill set and you need to play with that skill set.  Don't try to do what others are doing because OMG ME NEED 2 MAKE PLAYS LOL
poker,3d7krk,Shakuiller,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty bad advice... with 2 hour levels and going into 500bb day 2 with 30k start stacks, you can pass up marginal EV spots if you are a winning player in the field, marginal spots that might be suicidal to pass up in say, a $55 turbo online."

poker,3d7krk,Joong,2,Tue Jul 14 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"Cool read! Better luck next time. Do you feel like you could've min cashed if you weren't as nervous? Did your ""skill"" really diminish that much?  Probably not, still interesting to know your own thoughts on it."
poker,3d7krk,pr3mium,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly I wouldn't be coming back to play next year if I didn't think I could cash.  Playing in the Venetian deep stack tourney gave me a lot of confidence in my game.  I would say that about 75-80% of this field were players that went busto early on in the ME.  During that tourney I never went on any real heaters, just stuck to my game and managed to cash."
poker,3d7krk,pr3mium,2,Tue Jul 14 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Congrats on even getting to play in it.  I'm jealous of that alone.  And yeah, I figured nervousness would get to a lot of people for this tournament and cause them to make a lot of mistakes.  I say I'd stick to how I play usually, but honestly I'd get nervous.  I don't know though.  I didn't have any problems with that in the Milly Maker, except laying down JJ right before the end of day 1 when I clearly should've shoved a 3-bet.  Besides that, I think my decisions were sound.  I have a good friend of mine who's made it to the final 4 tables in the ME right now.  Joshua Beckley.  I'm definitely going to talk to him about his experiences when he gets back.  I've been ritualistically sending him, ""Good luck and run good"" every day since day 1 to him as the day starts."

poker,3d7krk,anonymous7,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:09 2015 UTC,"I'd cashed a couple of final tables in an Australian and NZ tournament at the end of last year with buy ins around $500-1500k. I was (I thought) at the top of my game, having won over 20k from tournaments and then several k more from 2/4 tables. I held 11k for the ME when the Asia Pacific WSOP came to town. I got smoked on day 1 too. I hadn't told anybody that I was entering, pretty much because of the reasons you said. I didn't wanna psych them up for it. I ran really bad, tried to run a really bad bluff and had to get it all in with an ace rag hand from the button. I quit poker until a couple months ago.   There's no lesson in this. Losing a big tournament just sucks cock. Also, bankroll management and shit."

I literally did the worst thing with my 17.2k remaining stack.  I 4-bet to 7100, got an insta-shove from the guy that 3-bet, and tank-folded.  If I'm gonna even 4-bet there, I need to get it in, right??  RIGHT??  The guy that did this had also accumulated over 40k in chips."

poker,3dbr71,Cheechie,3,Wed Jul 15 01:10:25 2015 UTC,Call and look at 55.
poker,3dbr71,_limitless_,2,Wed Jul 15 01:25:20 2015 UTC,It's tough but based on your reads this might be a fold. For a PFR to lead back into 4 players after they got check raised is really strong and for the good player (who knows this) to reshove is stronger.   I wouldn't be shocked to see the LAG show up with A/x or combodraw and the TAG to have a smaller 2p but you're probably beat by one of them.
poker,3dbr71,mt1rdt,2,Wed Jul 15 01:30:39 2015 UTC,I don't think you raised enough on the flop to know where you're at. But you're probably up against a set.
poker,3dbr71,Trunkington,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"Why did you only raise $13 more on the flop?  Make it $45 - $50.  There is a heart draw on the flop, and combinations of face cards that make Broadway straights.  Make draws pay.  The flop play was poor. Combinations that beat you are sets only.  UTG could easily be betting AK-AJ, and was waiting for safe turn card or a picked up draw.  UTG+1 could be trying to isolate LAGy player.  I think you call the shove.  Don't paint yourself into a corner here.  Play the hand fast on the flop."
poker,3dbr71,ILikeAllThings,2,Wed Jul 15 01:37:42 2015 UTC,"Besides 55, you could also be looking at a suited Ax that has two pair -- A5, A7, AT, AhKh, QhJh, etc. Because all eyes are on the LAG player at the table, and he's the one playing fast, the opponent may actually have forgotten that you're at the table -- he might just have top pair."
poker,3dbr71,_limitless_,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"UTG+1 could easily put you on a weak ace, and his shove could be either a combo draw like QhJh, or pair and draw AhJh, or a worse two pair A5/A7. Of course he could also have 55.  You are in this spot because your raise on the flop didn't put you anywhere.  I am leaning towards calling the turn shove due to his range being big enough to price yourself in with top two pair."
poker,3dbr71,ekoostikmartin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:52:44 2015 UTC,Definitely should have made it more on the flop but with what happened that's tough. If you see the UTG player as a LAG player like you mentioned UTG+1 would be doing this with Axdd or Axhh but 55 and 1010 are very likely. I think you have too much behind and not enough in the pot to be priced in. Tough fold but think you have to toss it.
poker,3dbr71,Th3Oscillator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:47:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I screwed up on the flop for sure. I felt as if I blocked AA or 1010 enough times so only set could be 55 which is pretty shitty luck imo

Back then poker still had the image of the shady game that you better watch your shit or you'll get cheated/robbed. Today is different.  Chris winning showed the public that a nobody could hang with these characters (remember characters? Back then every pro had a TV persona) and not only hang with them but beat them at their own game.  We've moved on from needing that. Now we need to show people that poker can be fun again, that it's not all 22 year old kids with hoodies and headphones talking about implied odds and vpip."

poker,3d78jw,ILikeAllThings,3,Tue Jul 14 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"No.  When the boom hit, live play was as much a part of it as online play.  I remember showing up at the Trop in AC and they'd have three rooms going, all packed, and you'd have to wait an hour for a seat.  The player demographics were: everyone.  Ok, mostly guys, but other than that.  Now you go and one of the rooms was turned into slots, the other is usually empty, and the main room is usually pretty dead.  You might still have to wait for a seat, but now it's because they only have a few going.  That's not because of the government.  The ratings of all major sports events die when the big names aren't playing.  Poker needs its stars.  People need to turn on the WSOP and recognize someone."
poker,3d78jw,robspeaks,2,Tue Jul 14 06:34:10 2015 UTC,"This makes me sad, because this is exactly what happened to my local poker room. The saddest part is, I was too young to experience the boom."

Poker needs more people creating action, and the decreased availability of online poker for people over the last ten years due to federal laws means less people playing at card rooms as well.  The rooms were so full for years in between 2000 - 2011 because of the ripple effect from online poker.  When Black Friday hit, many people seemed to lose interest in going to a live casino to play as well.  I wish I could find live stats, but I can't."

I play 1/2 live, 2/5 live and 2/4 online. I've been playing for several years pretty consistently.   Tonight I went on what may have been the worst hour run of my life.    Hand #1   I sit down at 1/2 with Max buy in ($200) seat 1 $65, seat 2 $480, seat 3 $260, seat 4 $85, seat 5 $375, seat 6 $135, seat 7 $85, seat 8 me, seat 9 $70.     Now that you have the framework lets get into where I went wrong.   First hand  Pre-flop: Utg+3 its folded to me. Raise to 12 (what's your hand?), folded to the big blind. He calls.   Flop comes 569 (what are the suits?) He checks I bet $25, he calls.   Turn 7 He checks. I check back.   River J He bets $35 I call.   Showdown He shows 78.   I seen the 1 card strait but put the jack more in his range of calling a 6x bb heads up."

poker,3dbfv0,DasBaaacon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"What are you complaining about? You were either good on the flop(better equity) or you had draws. All three hands are fine. I find it hard to believe that you could be a winning player especially at 2/5 live or 2/4 online if you have this kind of mentality.   Keep your head up bro! Coolers happen. Bad runs happen. This is only three times.   Imagine when it's 10. Or sometimes 20. I've had 8 losing sessions in a row and it legitimately sucks. So what.   Go workout. Hang out with friends. Go drink or take a nice walk. (I always go on a run the very next morning after a bad session.) Review notes, or read some theory, then go back to the grind if you are confident in your ability. Or maybe you do need to change how you play. But these few hands--there was nothing you could do about it."
poker,3d9mgs,Kuumakarhu,3,Tue Jul 14 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"Why did UTG turn into SB on the turn then back to UTG on river?  Anyway, I don't see a point in raising river. UTG opening ranges are pretty tight, and an overpair is a big part of that, which has you beat. I know it's a small sample, but 17/15 is pretty nitty.   I might even fold turn if I think he doesn't double barrel that often, since he's never value betting worse. However, since the turn bet is so small I guess you can peel."
poker,3d9mgs,spujara7,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:02 2015 UTC,What are we peeling for though? The last 6? That's the only card that  benefits us against his range. Unless we know he's stacking off every single time it hits I don't think it's the most profitable play.   I think there's a good arg to made for folding the turn.
poker,3d9mgs,RealNormalGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right, folding turn is the best option."
poker,3d9mgs,spujara7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"We are calling against random Ax high that 2 barrel cbet cheap.. and we do have some small equity vs his made hands.  So I do agree, with those small bets I call flop & turn in hope of a cheap showdown, and fold river with that sizing (good for him if he was bluffing)."
poker,3d9mgs,gyom999,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"But how often is he showing up with Ax? 17/15 would seem to indicate not much, right?   Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but what equity are we getting against a made hand? Just the 2% for the 6, and then whatever fold equity we can salvage, right?"
poker,3d9mgs,RealNormalGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"It's not that uncommon to see 2 barrels cbet with things like AJ+ in that spot, specially if villain hit a backdoor flush draw on turn (which he would hit on river in this case).  And preflop stats means nothing postflop.. some villain likes to cbet, others don't. The fact that he plays 17/15 doesn't implies that he can't 2 barrels from time to time (I'm not talking after his river 3rd barrel).  The thing here is the bet sizing at ~40% of the pot on flop & turn.. Sure there is a good chance we are not ahead, but there is a chance he's taking cheap stab at the pot with random overcards, which we beat.   So we call the cheap bets against is ""air"" range in hope of a cheap showdown and we are not totally dead and could get lucky with 2 outs against is made hand portion of his range. I mean, we're not calling in hope to get lucky with a 2 outter.. but for the times we are ahead.  If villain would have bet stronger on flop & turn, I would probably call flop (top pair & backdoor flush draw) and folded on the turn when I miss the backdoor."
poker,3d9mgs,gyom999,3,Wed Jul 15 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"Flatting 67hh here against an UTG raise from a 17/15 player with no callers in-between is generally not going a profitable play. Use Pokerstove or another range-vs-range calculator if you want to see the exact #'s, but assuming a somewhat wide 17/15 UTG open range of AKo, AQo, AJo, ATs+, KQs, 88+, you're just flat out crushed. Position alone cannot make up that big of a card disadvantage unless the opponent is a complete donk, which we don't have evidence of.  As played, flat call river or fold. Don't raise. Villain's range is heavily skewed toward pocket pairs 77+, all of which have you beat. What hands are you expecting to call this raise? A6? I heavily doubt anything he could potentially call and lose with are legitimate hands an UTG open would be holding. You can only beat a bluff-catcher, and that means someone just triple-barreled with overcards at 5NL, which is fairly uncommon."
poker,3d9mgs,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 14 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"Use Pokerstove or another range-vs-range calculator if you want to see the exact #'s, but assuming a somewhat wide 17/15 UTG open range of AKo, AQo, AJo, ATs+, KQs, 88+, you're just flat out crushed.   67s is an implied odds hand. You can't just look at preflop showdown equity and declare it unprofitable. Low pairs are also crushed by a UTG raising range.  But yes, given that the point is to flop strong hands and strong draws, we mustn't spew off when we flop one pair because then we're turning 67s into a strong reverse implied odds hand."
poker,3d9mgs,jkugelman,2,Tue Jul 14 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"While true, implied odds hands benefit most from multi-way pots. I didn't mean to suggest that range vs. range should be your only consideration when making calling decisions with speculative hands, just that it's worth considering in what's likely going to be a heads-up hand. People tend to fall in love with speculative hands 100bb deep in really marginal spots at best.   But yes, given that the point is to flop strong hands and strong draws, we mustn't spew off when we flop one pair because then we're turning 67s into a strong reverse implied odds hand.   Completely agree - the postflop decisions were much worse than the preflop call."
poker,3d9mgs,WeenisWrinkle,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"Utg raise from a tag player?  77+ Aj+ is probably a good range for that type of play.   Do we think that he's triple barrelling w/ Ak, Aq oop? Seems spewy from that type of player. I think an over pair is more likely.  If were set on raising, make it the turn since it provides the same outcome as raising the river, but allows us an easier river decision (and cheaper).  As played fold the river."
poker,3d9mgs,RealNormalGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"Everything else you need to hear has been pointed out, but that river raise if just spew vs a UTG nittier player here."

poker,3d9mgs,flipperstf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:53 2015 UTC,Why are you turning your hand into a bluff on the river when he doubles the relative bet size?
poker,3d9mgs,RudolfKGB,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:01:53 2015 UTC,"Usually when you bet or raise, it's for either for value or bluff/semi-bluff.  So here if you raise for value, you must think what worst hands gonna call you? The problem with that board is that the 33 on flop counterfits your 2 pairs, giving any overpair 2 pairs (ex TT-33). So your raise only gets called or raise by better hands and make fold hands you already beat."
poker,3d9mgs,gyom999,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"Consider folding the turn. You're just bluff catching. If you do call the turn, the river is a call or a fold. Raising makes no sense.  What hands are you targeting with your river raise? What worse hands is he calling with? Any overpair beats you. You're value owning yourself."

poker,3d9mgs,MathW,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"If UTG has you beat at any point in this hand, it is with an overpair.   Therefore, although you hit your 2p otr, you are still behind almost all of villain's value range.  So, your raise otr is a bluff.   Will villain lay down JJ-AA on this river card?   Maybe, but a lot of villains won't.  I'd consider folding because your hand loses to any pocket pair 88+ and that is this villain's most likely holding with his stats, UTG raise,  and 3 barrel betting."
poker,3d9mgs,rpm12345,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:23:38 2015 UTC,"If you are going to raise river, shove is the play since you are repping boats or bluffs (polarised = large sizing). This is fine with some frequency, which should depend on how often you think villain is going to hero fold/call his overpairs.   As a side note 3betting and calling are both fine pre, I tend to think the average 5nl reg will play worse against a 3b."
poker,3d9mgs,ArnieSchwarzenegro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"is 67 suited a good hand to 3bet utg with? I mean, I think I would 3b 6 handed but flat call in a full ring game. Also, shoving the river sounds cool it might put him into more of a leveling spot....however this is higher variance whereas raising to $3 will get paid off more often right?"
poker,3d9mgs,Clarityy,2,Tue Jul 14 16:24:18 2015 UTC,I think folding > calling > raising. utg range is simply too strong and won't be foldign to 3bets often. Our hand doesn't play very well vs an utg 3bet calling range and we have no blockers.
poker,3d9mgs,SkeetRag,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm probably flattig versus such a tight player more than folding. I also see no reason at all to raise
poker,3dbcsb,Fossana,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"math checks out.   there are post-flop scenarios which are incalculable where you may extract further edge by using a min-raise line (or your opponent may play better with his range and extract edge from you, making your MR line worse... depends on the players). Nice to know what your profitable r/c range is in certain situations and then evaluate whether you should take that line for thin value.  nh wp"

poker,3dbafy,mike143708,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:00:43 2015 UTC,Well your line LOOKS fine but your reads of the small sketchy bets and hairy raise on the turn make me think that he's trapping you? I mean... you have an ace so that makes 1 combo of AA... so it's hard for him to have it but not impossible... You say he loves to raise? like top pair top kicker raise otf? or what kind of hands is he raising? what does he think you have by 3 betting his button open and a standard cbet? how often do u 3b his opens and how often does he see what you 3b him with? I'm assuming since he is loose and likes to gamble he pretty much defends every 3b in position?
poker,3dbafy,ArnieSchwarzenegro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:12:30 2015 UTC,AA would reraise preflop 100% of the time. It's the first 3b he's seen from me. He raises his naked draws and big pairs alike. I suppose he has to put me on a big ace.
poker,3dbafy,ArnieSchwarzenegro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:14 2015 UTC,is he fishy enough to bet his hands? Like would he actually bet small with a shitty hand or is he not that much of a plopper?

I may be alone in this but I would say buying HHs to be shady, not cheating.  As for the multiple accounts thing, that could be argued as cheating maybe but you aren't directly influencing the results or physically cheating the game itself. You just have an edge with being anonymous.   The bracket bets are silly. Don't take bets with people you don't know.   He's a shady piece of shit but I personally don't look at him cheating in the way card markers or the like are."

It's not cheating in the classic sense. I agree it's shady and it does give you an edge but I don't see how it's influencing the results.

You could argue the 22vsAJ is just a cooler but I think you can actually hero fold in the spot he called. He also 5bet 78o vs AA. The 78vsAA was what I was mainly referring to when I said punt.

Of course, maybe she is playing maniacs who keep trying to bluff her with Ten high, so she is x/c'ing alot.  Example:  7/13/2015 5:26:47 PM PST (about 38 minutes ago)  Eights-Full for Kelly Minkin The action folds to Anton Morgenstern on the button and he raises to 175,000. Kelly Minkin calls in the small blind and then checks a flop.  Morgenstern drops in a bet of 250,000 and Minkin calls as the turn lands the and she checks. Pausing for a few moments, Morgenstern bets out 550 and Minkin goes into the tank for roughly three minutes before calling. Before the dealer could deliver the river, both Morgenstern and Minkin shoot a glance at each other as the dealer delivers the on the river. Minkin checks, as does Morgenstern, and Minkin tables her for a flopped full house as Morgenstern mucks. Anton Morgenstern - 7,915,000 (99 bb) Kelly Minkin - 7,575,000 (95 bb)"

poker,3d6v98,BornIn1500,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"But that wouldn't make sense because if he cashed big, which is what it looks like now, he'll never make that money back through his streaming."
poker,3d6v98,AmericanYidGunner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"Well streaming is probably only part of what he envisions as becoming a type of brand.  He likely had already planned to spin it into some sort of sponsorship deal.   And he probably didn't foresee holding the chip lead going into day 7, but either way, worst case scenario he's the dude that made someone who watches his twitch channel a millionaire."
poker,3d6v98,beginplo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think selling shares was to promote his channel necessarily. He wasn't spamming r/poker advertising his available action. As he mentioned during his stream he wanted to give people sweats for small percentage increments. He scheduled for ~43k worth of buyins minus 20k lammers he won minus all the pieces he sold roughly 23k(using min markups) he ""freerolled"" the whole series."

I look at Hellmuth and say ""I put you on 3 6, all in"" and shove my chips in.  Hellmuth looks like he's going to explode and starts ranting about how ridiculous it is that I've somehow managed to soul read him and put him on his exact cards. I feel like an absolute king until I realise he's taking the piss. He calls with AQ and an A on the flop puts me out of the ME after 10 minutes.

When you started playing poker, did you do it as a hobby or did you immediately start studying as you started the game? How long did it take you to become a winning player?  The reason why I ask is because I'm 19 years old and have studied poker hard for ~45 days, and have done very casual studying for another ~5 months. I'm a losing player at NL2 and think that maybe my approach of hand reviews/reading books won't teach me some of the things that players with more experience with the game have (even if they're losing players). I might also just be a bad player that can't put my knowledge into play when I'm under pressure playing for cash."

Lead the flop, and the turn to leave a small SPR river value shove. When the 10 paired on this river, the money was still going in regardless due to SPR, and sure enough, he had J10. There were 2 other hands yesterday with similar situations that resulted in large pots being lost, one being 300bb.

I have played poker on and off my entire life and want to get better at it. What hand should I never play, what hand should I always play and what is a good sign another player has something and I should bail?"
poker,3d80al,MrMogz,3,Tue Jul 14 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"There is no hand you should never play. Example: you're on the button and both blinds fold 80%+ to steals. You should be opening every single hand when it's folded to you.    The same is true for your other questions. They are vague and there is no answer, especially regarding poker where you shouldn't have an ""I always do this with this hand"" strategy. There are always different table dynamics with the players you're seated with.    Instead you should be focusing on the basic fundamentals of poker. The only time it's clear you should bail from a hand is VS a loose passive (always call every bet) that starts raising in the hand, they ALWAYS have it."
poker,3d80al,kennewickman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:48 2015 UTC,Ok 80% steals? Not familiar with this term. So you're saying there's never a bad hand because I should be focusing on table dynamics instead?
poker,3d80al,MrMogz,3,Tue Jul 14 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"Online players use a HUD, which keeps track of every hand you play and shows all the stats (that you set) to show of your opponents. It only works session to session for anonymous tables (obviously) but yes, having the information that the blinds fold too much, (a late position open into the blinds is a steal to just pick up those blinds since it's essentially free money if they're folding too often) means you can raise any 2 cards profitably.    And no, that's not what I'm saying. In that specific example regarding stealing yes, the rest of the time it depends on table dynamics and your post flop skill what hands you should be raising from which position.    Example: I open 45s UTG in cash games, a lot of people will fold this but open it from LP+. Depends on you, how good/confident you are. Based off our little convo here, I can safely assume you have a lot of work to do. Not that that's a bad thing! Enjoy it."

It's called a HH (hand history) where you post exaxtly how the hand played out with all relevant information included. Then we all discuss to determine if it could've been played differently, you just got unlucky, etc. if you scroll through the pages on /r/poker you should see some of these hands. I recommend you look through a bunch to know what I'm talking about, and see what some people in the comments say as well.    That being said, hands like 83 and 84 are pretty awful and only really playable in situations like I described above where it's free money to raise any 2 cards."

Is this correct? It feels like the jam is a bit large, but if I 5 bet without jamming I'm like always committed with any 2 cards right, so I assume jamming bluffs/value here is correct?"
poker,3d80al,AllTooNew,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"100bb deep I'm assuming?  Then yes, just jam.  On a side note:  If you're asking this question then I'll assume you're talking about microstakes (sorry if not).  And in the microstakes don't ever 4bet or 5bet bluff.  Like...Ever.  You'll spew off way more chips than if you just play an exploitive strategy.  No need to balance your 4b/5b bluffing range.  I think 3bet bluffing in position as a squeeze play can be very profitable.  But I'd even limit your 3b bluffs/squeezes OOP from the blinds honestly."
poker,3d80al,Stixx_27,2,Tue Jul 14 19:42:09 2015 UTC,My BR has moved up and down for a while so I've switched between stakes. Whenever I play 16NL-25NL zoom I'm bluff jamming frequently vs alot of players as they 4 bet fold a high percentage.  Edit: Ty for response mate
poker,3d80al,AllTooNew,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"I see I see.  Right on.  What kind of sample size are you pegging that stat on?  Fold to 4b/5b is such a rare occurrence that I can't imagine it almost ever being accurate.  Even if you have thousands of hands on a player, how many times are you actually 4betting that player?  It's just such a rare stat to peg on a player it seems somewhat trivial and I'd rather use the general player base for tendencies like this in microstake zoom.  And what is actually in your 4bet bluffing range exacly?  A9s?  I feel like every other hand I can think at 100bb I'd rather just flat IP or fold.  I think that dynamic would change 200bb+ deep, but not 100bb~.  Thoughts?  edit: specifically talking about zoom"
poker,3d80al,Stixx_27,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"I just find plenty of agro players especially at 16NL Zoom who have 3 bet percentages in the SB of 15% which I guess is fine, except if they are then only willing to GII with Aces-Queens and AK i can 4 bet bluff them profitably. I.E they have wide 3 bet ranges but don't back this up with light GII ranges."
poker,3d80al,AllTooNew,2,Tue Jul 14 21:20:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  However, I do feel like that's a different of enough situation than the original that it doesn't really pertain :).  Since in the original example you brought up the villain is doing the 4bet, but in this example we're doing the 4bet.  For example, let's say we open from the CO with the range of hands that we would potentially 4b bluff with (still curious at what that might be), then we get 3b from the button who has a high 3b%.  We now have 3 options, 4b bluff, fold, or flat playing a bloated pot OOP.  Why not fold the bottom of this specific range, and flat the top of the specific range (allowing us to play a hand stronger than his 3betting IP range).  Let's say AJo for example.  Against a nitty player, I'm happily folding AJo OOP.  But against the player you're mentioning, seems like an easy flat to have a dominating range advantage on.  A lot of these high 3b% players will also have a really high cbet/barrel frequency.  So if we have a range advantage on them, it seems it could be higher +ev to flat and let them hang themselves opposed to 4bet bluffing.  If we 4b bluff we're obviously only going to get called/jammed on by better.  And when we 4b and fold to a 5b we can be making huge mistakes without realizing our equity.   Somewhat of a ramble, but hopefully my point (whether correct or not) is clear enough."
poker,3d80al,POKER_SLUT,2,Tue Jul 14 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Wow I've honestly never thought of this approach. I've recently become accustomed to fighting fire with more fire (i.e being aggressive vs agro players) but this makes far more sense EV wise.   Yeah can't believe I didn't think of this - Just flat hands that have a range advantage, fold those that don't and it's all +EV. Thanks mate."

Would love to hear strategy.   Table has a lot of players overplaying passive pre flop, which seems exploitable somehow because their vpip - pfr is like 35/0  or 42/3 or 50/7.    While it's great to have calling stations heads-up I end up in too many multi-way pots that make post-flop play with something like top/top or an overpair into scary hands (I find myself running into two pair, trips, etc with frequency) and make missing the flop completely unwinnable.  I usually am somewhere around 18/12   20/14.    Do you narrow your range in this situation?   Hammer your pre-flop raises to a level you normally wouldn't (5x?  15x 3bet?) to try and isolate heads-up?   Curious about strategy here.   How do you guys deal with these kinds of tables"

Lets say for example we're only going to survive 3 more orbits. (So 3 BBs) Are we shoving any suited connector, any Ace, any King? Obviously we're shoving any pair and any A 9 or higher most likely. But are we that desperate we'll shove any high card to avoid having to be put all in with something like 8 2? We want to use our remaining BBs to get as few people in the pot as possible, so waiting until the last orbit not only doesn't net you a big enough double up, but lets too many people stay in the pot for cheap.  When I'm on the bubble as a short stack, I'm usually still trying to win. I'm not the guy just wanting to survive the bubble and make it until the very last orbit to try to secure a min cash, I'm trying to double up still and still have a chance to run deeper.

I know a fair bit about the game and generally speaking get it in when I'm ahead but it seems I'm more often then not on the wrong end of flips/races etc... If I were to estimate, I'd say  I lose 60-75% of the time on shoves after leading the flop, sometimes quite marginally. One really bad beat I had was at a local poker room tourney bubbled with AA shove preflop with roughly 20bb, gets called by 99 from the chip leader. Two other players stated folded 9's and ended up losing to a four card flush. May also mention that only one of his 9's were live suit wise as both of us had hearts."

Also understand that most average Joe player's don't differentiate between running bad and playing bad (if you keep hitting top of your opponents range maybe you're just only ever getting it in against that) and that there are 1000x better ways to improve than dwelling on the bad beats and the suck outs.

poker,3d81y9,kaellinn18,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:42:03 2015 UTC,You are correct.   Sometimes people would shove my BB for like 3 more and I'd have to call with marginal hands.
poker,3d81y9,window_turnip,2,Tue Jul 14 20:48:12 2015 UTC,Yes.   Sometimes I called all ins to bust and was behind.   Sometimes I was in the BB etc etc.
poker,3d8af7,miles5555,3,Tue Jul 14 07:54:05 2015 UTC,"You checked a dry king high flop, which is kind of unusual, then c/r and he called. Then, he shoved the turn. Don't think he play this way with KQ and he wouldn't just call pre as V2 with AK.   It should be a fold but at this level the players are too new. He could easily be a player who does not know where he is at 1/4 of the time. He could have decided to take a stab at it in last position after your flop check and then just went for it. Maybe with the backdoor club draw. Betting .65 doesn't leave you much for a river bet. If he calls your .65, then there is 2.40 in the pot with .99 left. He's really pot committed, so maybe he did just decide to go with his king. Stacks are awkward. I think you should just call. Like you say, if you lose half the time, you are ahead."
poker,3d8af7,RudolfKGB,2,Tue Jul 14 10:13:06 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd just cbet flop and not try to get cute. On turn you made this happen and you pretty much have to call, maybe he can just have KQ."
poker,3d8af7,taym8,2,Tue Jul 14 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"Cbet or check call this flop because all check raising does is isolates yourself against stronger hands (sets, 2p). Kx might even fold to this check raise, you might get value from AK a small percentage of the time (you also have blockers to AK). I'm no expert but I think Cbetting this flop would be a lot better than check calling aswell, because we don't want to risk allowing 2 players to realise their equity by giving them a free card. Then cbetting the turn if you get raised you can put the hand down cheaply. This XR is asking for trouble imo. But in the end I think it's a call if you only have to be right a quarter of the time. The % of times villain is spazzing or bluffing I think you'll be right 25% and be a pretty neutral EV call."
poker,3d8af7,Scrubxlol,2,Tue Jul 14 10:37:18 2015 UTC,"like the others said before - cbet the flop - personally i only check those kind of flops with AA when im HU   as played: just call him off at the turn he could have KX of clubs or he could just be a donkey - though in my mind i was saying ""78"" the whole way for some reason so if you would have chosen an other line you could have avoided this situation"

The extreme example would be BB ""bets"" his blind, SB calls the blind, check to the river, big blind shows first. Another way I think about it live is ""I'll pay to see this one"", IE, when I call I get to see what he was betting/raising."

poker,3d5lns,CAHelix,3,Mon Jul 13 20:00:38 2015 UTC,Some casinos/online poker sites use the last aggressor shows first rule and some use the first player to the left of the button shows first rule.  In online poker some clients have an auto muck the loosing hand option so players with this setting enabled will have to show their cards by choice if they are not forced to show depending on which of the above rules the site is using.

A lot of clients allow people who have the option to muck to show one or both cards if they desire, but both cards can be seen in the hand history.  If it goes check check on the river, the last person to make a bet has to show first."

It was a great site and run very well so I don't think people should be running him off as he's put a LOT into the game (including being a public face running a site that was briefly US-facing).  As for the game...eh.  I've seen games with random wilds before so it's nothing new really.  Just increases the variance of a normal game.  I don't think it's going to reengage anyone, as it's still a texas hold em game.  I'd def play for real money, as it's a beatable game (and you know how to get recs into the game).  Is real money play (US-facing) on the schedule?"
poker,3d7prq,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the feedback, I agree, random wilds nothing new, but community wild I think is somewhat of a new tweak. I think it's pretty much putting Texas Hold'em on godlike mode.  In terms of the US, I think until Federal regulation kicks into play, which I think is at least 5 years away, I think if this game has gotten hold, then yes, why not, but before that, unfortunately not.    But thanks for the vouching. Appreciate it.  Cheers, David"
poker,3d7prq,Fossana,2,Tue Jul 14 05:24:29 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. Changing the game just a bit doesn't suddenly make it interesting. Straight flushes and four of a kinds aren't fun to get if you see them all the time. I would be more interested in variations that make the game more skill-based, perhaps a game where you have to choose your hole cards, but want to avoid choosing the same cards as other people.  I would only play the game if 10% of facebook users were playing it for real money, but that would be true with any poker game."
poker,3d7prq,LatinBeef,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:41:51 2015 UTC,"ok good points, but I think in this case, the objective would be to make it more fun and if skill factors into it, then great. I think there is a variant like you've suggested, where you can actually bid on hole cards as well and it is an established home game variant. I think more than anything, I wanted the new variant to be an extreme, so it was more than just Texas Hold'em plus.  In terms of how popular it gets, I mean, this really isn't the target market, but it's a great place to get legit feed back. I mean, in terms of letting players know, I can always spend more on the FB adverts - but I agree, the novelty of getting higher value hands wears off quickly, but what we've noticed thus far is that casual gamers like to have hands where they think they can play with it and play with it as though they have pocket aces or the made nuts on the flop, which is also a new experience for them, but even that may be something in passing.   I think what is also interesting is looking at why casual poker players play on facebook already. The conversion from casual to real money is not going to ever happen, but again, if something gets popular enough, there will be those who may be reminded of playing hold'em again. I guess we'll find out in a few months whether or not the novelty of getting higher or made hands is sticky enough, because really that is the primary thing the Hero card (wild community card) does.  Cheers."

Flop you can cbet smaller as long as you have less than a pot sized bet on turn left, because you smash this board so hard and there's not many draws.  I think you have less than a pot sized bet remaining on turn so definitely jam rather than making it this awkward tiny sizing. River is kinda gross but I think we can find a fold, villain is not doing this with AJ or air (since he doesn't rep any draws or anything) so folding seems better than calling, however you should have been looking to get it in on the turn."

But when I was at a live table a few months ago there was this old man on disability that loved to just ship it. We got to the river in a rather small pot and he goes ""check it?"" and checks to me. I said sure and show top pair decent kicker and win it. He nods his head and a few hands later something happens and I end up folding to him. He gives me a 3bb rebate and tables the nuts."

We should make these people feel welcome and respect them for what they are.

poker,3d47eo,goldwin-es,8,Mon Jul 13 11:37:55 2015 UTC,"I'd bet a little more on the flop...like $0.13-0.14.  Turn, you can either check, intending to call most river bets, or bet and fold to a raise.  Either way, it will be hard to get more than 1 more street of value.  With more draws out there, I'd lean more towards betting,  In this hand, there is really only one draw and it's a backdoor draw, so checking might be slightly better here.  If we are going to bet, I think the bet should be smaller -- 2/3 to 3/4 pot.  You are still charging a potential flush draw, but you are betting small enough to where it's easier for worse hands to continue to call (mostly 8x and small-mid pocket pairs)."
poker,3d47eo,MathW,3,Mon Jul 13 12:06:54 2015 UTC,"I would advise betting more on the flop and slightly less on the turn here.  I'd have done for $0.15 on the flop, lots of worse hands will call a bet that size. Then, on the turn, the pot would have been $0.49 and I would have bet around $0.30.  When he checks the river again, I'd be mighty tempted to make a 1/3 pot sized bet to get max value from 8x/99/TT type hands but I don't blame you for checking."
poker,3d47eo,RegiTime,2,Mon Jul 13 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"Preflop is fine. Flop bet is a little on the small side imo, if he's calling $0.08 he's calling anything(within reason) and you're ahead almost always here, bet $0.12-$0.16. Turn sizing though, is too big; it looks like you saw an overcard and got scared. The king is a great card for you though imo, he won't be calling very often with very many Kx other than K8 and K4 compared with all his random pocket pairs and 8x. Betting something like $0.22-$0.28 seems like a good size. On the river I think you could still bet for thin value because he's shown no sign of folding so far and other than 4x and K8 I don't think you're beaten here and you normally hear from 4x before the river. If I was extracting max value I'd be betting a little under 1/2 pot to give him a good price to call with his A8/98/66 on a scary looking board."
poker,3d47eo,RudolfKGB,2,Mon Jul 13 12:14:30 2015 UTC,GJ with formatting your post. Noobs take note.
poker,3d47eo,GrayFaceNoSpace,2,Mon Jul 13 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"Overall not poorly played, just nit-picking:  Reverse the sizing of your flop and turn bets. On the turn here you need to be going after value from lower PPs, 8x hands, and overcard calls from looser players (these calling stations are common at 2NL, don't want to miss out on that fat value). On the turn, you have a major scare card (the loose overcards caller just got there with AK, KQ, KJ, KT), but you also have a chance to get good value from backdoor draws and a stubborn PP holder.   This turn is a 'thin value' situation, where you know that if you bet, you're going to get called by both worse hands and by better hands. However, the sizing of your bet can influence how many worse hands go ahead and make the call. Armed with this info, betting smaller is preferable to insure we keep the range of hands we beat in the hand, and not fold them out. By betting the size of the pot, you're potentially folding out stubborn PPs, and even some disciplined folds from flush draws. By betting half the pot or 2/3 pot, you're going to get enough calls from worse hands to more than make up for the times you get called with Kx making the bet +eV over the long run, and you've minimized your loss when you're up against Kx hands."
poker,3d47eo,WeenisWrinkle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"The formatting is good.  I like checking behind on the turn because I think it's hard to get called by worse very often (although it seems like you did get called by worse this time), especially since you sized the bet so large. Your opponent likely has very few outs anyway. I like checking the turn and calling a river bet or betting the river yourself if your opponent checks."
poker,3d47eo,Sense1ess,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"Raise little more pre-flop, say, to 0.10-0.14, especially against early open limpers which suggest fishy players. These players call too much so you want max value from them.  Same goes for the flop. Just pot it, if they have a smaller pocket pair or A8 they are calling anyway they don't care what you have. Missing value against these hands is more criminal vs losing to the occasional 88 or A4, etc.   Very bad turn card for you but you shouldn't be too worried. I mean if he called your flop bet with KT he can have sooo many worst hands you can beat and will call you off with 1 more street. A8, AQ, AJ, AT, even A9, JJ to 22(excl 88 44), QT, QJ, T9, JT, etc etc plus any club combo or backdoor draws like 35c, A2, blah blah you name it. AK KQ KJ KT K9 is just a very very small range of his worst hands. Missing value vs worst hands is more criminal than very occasionally losing to a Kx, 88, 44, A4. You should definitely bet here, a value bet sizing about 2/3 of the pot.   River a club, another bad card but again you should not be too worried. ValueBet/fold to a significant raise (if a fish hits he will likely just jam it there). Over the long run you will gain a lot of value from worse hands than occasionally losing when he hits his trash. The value bet should be 1/3 to 1/2 size of the pot, and fold to a significant raise.  Again this is only vs fishy players, against regular players playing this way is spewing off chips."
poker,3d47eo,joesun1015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"Bet flop more, I know it's dry but if we can get more money in, why not? Make it 12-15, on turn, why bet so large, or frankly, why bet at all? With this overcard we can probably only get 1 more street of value, and I think letting Villain bluff is best, as we can call all non club rivers because not many KX call flop."
poker,3d47eo,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:42 2015 UTC,"Why are you potting K turn? Your goal is to make worse hands call and/or better to fold, what you are doing here is making every K in his (limp call, lol..) range call and everything you beat, fold. So bet flop bigger for value, 2nl players really call 65-75% if they call 50% so something like .13 seems fine. Bet half pot on turn for value again, or just check it back with intention to call most rivers, or to bet thin for value when checked to...  Hands like these are good when you are reviewing it, think what you are trying to accomplish by potting that K turn. You wrote ""K has come and villain checked"", it is very common to check to the preflop agressor when playing out of position, even if he holds the K. Betting in the dark into preflop agressor is called donking and in most cases is not very profitable, so him checking here does not mean he doesn't have the K ever.  All in all to answer your questions:  Preflop is perfect  Flop could be bigger, 65-75% pot to get value from basically every overcard and PP / 8s  Turn is horrendous, bet ~50-60% if you want to bet here. I would check back, basically call most rivers when led into or bet 33-50% for value on blanks when checked to.  River is correct AS PLAYED, dont think there's any value here after that turn action."
poker,3d47eo,Jarggo,0,Mon Jul 13 20:59:30 2015 UTC,Everybody is writing essays over here! I'm going to keep it short. Bet 2/3 on flop and turn. When betting pot on turn you only get calls by hands that beat you. Either bet bet x/f or bet check x/c.
poker,3d85bh,Rinor8181,4,Tue Jul 14 06:48:42 2015 UTC,That's not the worst bad in the history of poker by far. The only thing unlikely about that scenario is they both have aces. The whole running flush thing happens often enough.  I would say the worst beat I've ever scene is quads versus royal flush. That event is infinitely less likely to happen than this scenario.

poker,3d4xzg,Four_Months,2,Mon Jul 13 15:46:57 2015 UTC,"To expand for any newbies reading, the reason he should shove it in is because with $55 in his stack and $105 in the pot, OP is pot-committed. Even if villain flipped his flush face-up and shoved with a smug look on his face, OP still is getting proper odds to call (roughly 3:1 pot odds) with the amount of outs he has to improve to a full house."

poker,3d4xzg,ILikeAllThings,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"Could mean anything, but I think it does narrow his range a bit. He's likely check/jamming this flop if he made a baby flush. He's either nailed a big flush on the flop or has Ah/x or also hit a set of 4s or 2s. Hard to see him playing anything else like this."
poker,3d4xzg,Four_Months,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing there is to take information from is the hand you played against the villain.  I think beyond what you provided as his range, based on the fact you push AK high in the previous hand you played him (and he didn't have anything better than one pair), you can add 10x's to his range, 66-99, and big Ax hands with a heart, and 53 or A3. Villain may be floating you OOP, to bet if you slow down as well with any pair in hand or on board.  He may just want to take a pot off of you based off the fact you took one off him.  Emotions get in the way of player decisions at 1/3 NL.  But, yeah, shove the turn.  Like everyone else said.  Oh, and buy in for the $300 max instead of short stacking.  You'd get more value from this guy by possible overshoving the turn and getting a call from an angry guy who just can't let go of his black nines against the jerk who busted my PP when he Kinged the river."

poker,3d4xzg,tswpoker1,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"To be hon nest, I don't think it's possible to construct a range on a dark check. That move can be both weak or strong so you've really got little to work on. I feel it's a weak move for the most part."
poker,3d4xzg,mt1rdt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"Even if you could have convinced yourself that villain couldn't possibly make this move without the nut flush, you still should shove.

poker,3d4xzg,KhabaLox,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:18 2015 UTC,So on the flop pot was 45 and you had 85 behind? I'd just get it in right there. You're never folding to a reraise and you're never not jamming the turn of your cbet gets called.  Just jam the flop and get paid by Ah/x.
poker,3d4xzg,gusty_bible,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"If he jams the flop there is a great chance he doesn't get paid by Ah/x, but as he played it it looks like he might have a chance to jam a safe turn and certainly be paid off by Ah/x. I prefer the 30 bet."
poker,3d4xzg,KhabaLox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"$30 gives V 2.5:1 to call. That's pretty close, but I think makes it right to call with a single heart.  Any bet makes SPR on the turn ugly,  so I like shoving g the flop. Hopefully someone remembers the AK hand."
poker,3d4xzg,KhabaLox,2,Mon Jul 13 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"If he's up against Ah/x and my math is correct, he's giving the villain 3:1 on his money to call the turn with 4:1 odds. He's making the villain make two straight calls where he's not quite getting the right price on his heart draw.  If villain calls with Ah/x the whole way and gets there, oh well, rebuy and try again, but you're getting your money in good on both streets here."
poker,3d4xzg,ilouiei,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:00:04 2015 UTC,"AhXh is about 29% equity.  Ah5x and Ah3x is 35%.  30% equity would be 2.33:1 odds (to the river).  If you bet $30 on the flop giving him 2.5:1, you're left with a $55 bet into a $105 pot, giving him 160:55 or 2.9:1.  Ah8s is 18% on the turn which is ~4:1.  Yep, looks OK.

Just taking the pot down right there will increase your stack by ~23%.  I think your shove is fine, especially because the next level is going to really put you in a tough place.  Checking is really gross because we're OOP with no real idea of villain's range (unless you have history on villain's open limping range?).  If villain bets with overcards or something like 55 and we fold, that's just a ticket to fuck city."

Even with her having a top 20% hand you're still a slight favorite (and if we widen it just a bit to include things like 22-55, you become a 55-45 favorite). She's limping a much wider range than that.   Factor in some fold equity and the dead money and you get it in there 10/10 times.  Edit: I'm pretty sure this is a shove even if we know for a fact she has and is calling with a top 10% hand. (Which we don't, and she doesn't.)  88 v top 10% is 43.5 v 56.5. After blind ante and her limp there is 7k-ish in the pot and you have 21k behind. You'll be risking 21k to win an extra 28k. (This is where my math gets fuzzy, so if I'm off base, let me know.)

I'd probably fold as played though, only worse hand I could see doing this is Ad10d and the other AK combos.  Hand 2: Probably folding KQo preflop UTG 9 handed at a loose table. Another kinda gross spot on this flop. Has villain shown down any bluffs or semi bluffs? Is she willing to stack off with hands like QJ or Q10 here?

poker,3d6rc0,vethlock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"I misinterpreted tho pot size on the turn and thought it was about 70. However, I don't think it makes much difference in our decision whether we bet 35-45 when she reraises  all in."
poker,3d6rc0,vethlock,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"When someone makes a small bet on this turn and I have a hand like Ad10d, Kxdd, or 10d9d I'd be shoving all day cause they are basically telegraphing that they have a weak ace or maybe KK and can't stand pressure. When we bet this small we are giving an amazing price to drawing hands... when you think you have the best hand bet more in this spot, but I personally like checking back this turn."
poker,3d6rc0,Proteus010,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"Hand 1: Check the turn. as played, fold  Hand 2: fold pre in that position. As played, call."
poker,3d6rc0,roboneal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"Your illustration hand (her turning a set) seems to indicate she plays her made hands kinda ""trappy"".  Which seems to polarize her ""over-shoving"" hands quite a bit to bluffs or semi-bluffs.  Hand 2 seems like a pretty easy call. Hand 1 seems more marginal (she may be thinking she's protecting her turned trips against flush/straight draws)."

It's a sick game, and sometimes it's good to remember the highs instead of just dwelling on the lows."

No reason to be bet more since you are either way ahead or way behind in that spot anyway so you don't really need to bet to protect. Also if you're going to start check calling in these spots you have to start doing it with your stronger hands too to balance your range or you'll become exploitable.

If he was gonna bluff he'd click pot again and just continue. At least that's what I was thinking right or wrong at the time.   If he does this with sets plus it's terrible though. He definitely could ship set because my hand looks like AK. Kinda sucks cause this is the 2nd highest hand in our range. Id probably play the same way with QT.

What do you beat other than a total bluff?

poker,3d1c9p,patrick6,6,Sun Jul 12 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"This is correct! From a practical point of view the variation in bet sizing can probably be reduced considerably. For example you can reduce the bet sizing to 1/8 increments times the pot, until a set maximum  (e.g. [0, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, ..., max]). I say probably because the effects of imposing a limit on bet-sizing is unknown."

poker,3d1c9p,BerryGuns,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:12:19 2015 UTC,"Backgammon:       Backgammon is one of the oldest board games for two players. The playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.  Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, over a series of many games, the better player will accumulate the better record. Thus, records of matches between players are good indicators of relative skill.  With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. In variants that originate from early 20th century New York, players may raise the stakes during the game. There is an established repertoire of common tactics and occurrences.  Like chess, backgammon has been studied with great interest by computer scientists. Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players (see TD-Gammon for an example).

poker,3d2f59,Emersontm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:51 2015 UTC,People used to say this was the case for online play. Using an odd number showed a lot more chips on the table than an even number bet
poker,3d2f59,PilateBlack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"If you bet 999 then your opponent might make the connection and realize you're trying to get him to call. Not likely, but probably more likely than him actually falling for it when he wouldn't call 1000."
poker,3d2f59,MathW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:24:15 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was because bets of 999 put a lot more animated chips out there than 1000.  It 'looks' more intimidating.  The effect is probably very small or non-existent, but it doesn't really cost anything to do."
poker,3d2f59,IADaveMark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:42:12 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily relevant to the 9 vs 10 issue, but putting a peculiar number of chips out makes the pot odds math harder for some people."
poker,3d3xlz,SvenKramer123,3,Mon Jul 13 09:22:39 2015 UTC,"Use www.handconverter.com next time please, just makes it easier on the eyes.  Pre is fine, I think I generally fold to the 3bet but if you say villain is agro then yeah, all good.  I like the flop call, our range is pretty strong here so it's okay to fold but if villain is not 2 barreling this texture a lot then getting to showdown is a good plan.  No reason to lead turn. I do expect this turn to go check/check a lot but I think overcards will just fold if you lead here, he's not going to bet a lot of bluffs on this turn because we're not folding much that calls the flop, which leads straight into:  River, because villain doesn't bluff turn much he still has all of his bluffs in his river range. The jack is kinda meh, it hits us a bit more than him I guess, he could definitely vbet a J if he hit it, but I also expect him to bluff his KQ AQ and club draws here, so I think the call is fine. I don't think it's massively +ev but a solid call nonetheless, expect to lose quite often #pokerlife.  All in all it's fine. I think folding flop is not terrible, but when we call flop and the hand plays out this way we have to call river.  PS his stats don't really indicate that he's aggro to be honest, simply don't have the sample. I think I let it go pre, but obviously I didn't see the 7 hands you did so maybe he showed something down that made you read him as aggro."

poker,3d3gt9,bigbyboar,5,Mon Jul 13 05:35:36 2015 UTC,"ICM as far as I'm aware all there is to it. It shows that calling and losing allins is worse in tournaments than in cash games, which means shoving for the fold equity is profitable. When you're shortstacked, calling bets is really awkward because you don't have any implied odds and you don't want to face a cbet for your whole stack when you miss the flop. If you get called for your whole stack at least you get to see all five cards."
poker,3d3gt9,Fossana,8,Mon Jul 13 05:44:36 2015 UTC,"Math.  Based on a reasonable player's calling range and the chips you stand to gain, it's +cEv to shove in many short stack situations."
poker,3d3gt9,Touch_Of_Red,3,Mon Jul 13 06:14:55 2015 UTC,The reason given previously and also to thin the herd...shoving with the ranges in push fold charts you'll most likely be no worse than 30/70 heads up and most times if you shove you will only get one opponent...limping in might turn what was a hand that would have got through against one opponent into a hand that has to face 3 or 4 and that makes it much less likely you will win.
poker,3d3gt9,cobwebscavern,0,Mon Jul 13 06:51:56 2015 UTC,Its good when u dont want someone coming over the top on u. Usually only do it with 10bbs~ or less. U have more fold equity than minraising with small stacks. And when u r ss usually there r antes along with blinds so it becomes very profitable when u can open shove CO or later.

poker,3d3wwb,spicygobby,4,Mon Jul 13 09:10:45 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not they do actually think of this, and you can't just deposit and then withdraw your money and the bonus.  Generally the % based bonuses require you to earn whatever the site's equivalent of ""play points"" are. You earn these points by paying rake either by tournament entry fees or the rake that is taken out of the pot after each cash hand.  It's very slow to earn your bonus (for example 888 requires you to pay $100 in rake to get $10 of your bonus, if I remember correctly), and you have limited time, so if you are new to poker I would honestly say just ignore the % based bonuses, if you are really focusing on it you are more likely to bust your roll than to make extra money, this is because you are currently a losing player (if you're new). So if they offer either a % bonus or a smaller ""instant"" bonus, take the instant one."

poker,3d3wwb,Clarityy,2,Mon Jul 13 11:15:17 2015 UTC,For example this site says it offers 200% of your first deposit. Does that mean you can withdraw that or only play with it? It says up to 1500 dollar bonus!?! Couldn't you just make new accounts to take advantage of this and withdraw it.   It's almost like the site would have to have some terms and conditions or some kind of fine print or even something like rules to follow for these things?!?  I wonder if they have ever thought of doing something like that and if the details could be found on the site?
poker,3d3wwb,Four_Months,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:22:09 2015 UTC,Read the T&Cs if this is going to be a factor in choosing a site where you play.....for reasons already given the you have Bob Hope and No Hope of ever seeing anywhere near 200% bonus of an initial deposit.   See if you can find a site that will give you a straight off matched deposit amount....even with those there is usually a limit that you have to play-through with the bonus maybe 10x before you can withdraw.   Basically don't let the opening offers be a main choice factor in deciding where you are going to be playing.

poker,3d34lp,bigbyboar,3,Mon Jul 13 03:36:31 2015 UTC,"At a typical 1/2 table, you'll usually find a balanced spread of spewy players and tight passive players, with the occasional good reg.  At 5T in my local casino, there are just a bunch of regs playing against each other all the time. The player pool is typically the same 15 people who have played each other over thousands of hands. There is always the ""new guy"" who's taking a shot, or some businessman stopping by in the area. In my opinion, unless you are a crusher, 2/5 is way more profitable."

The majority of players you'll see here are guys that know how to play and they're just there to have fun and socialize, hence the loose passive style favored by most of them.   5/10 is where you'll start running into pros who pull on 60k+/year playing poker. It's not uncommon to sit down and see 2 or 3 pros. Not big names like Phil Galfond or Negreanu, but guys who make a comfortable living playing. Even the fish are significantly better, and are almost certainly 1/2 winners.   2/5 is somewhere in between.   Source: 2/5 reg who plays 5/10 on occasion."

I'm thinking of depositing some money on there so I can double the volume I put in cause right now I'm only on Bovada. I've heard that there is some sort of bad beat jackpot on all of the tables that makes the rake really hard to beat... is this true? Also how fast/easy are the payouts? Is there a lot of daily traffic in the 50nl - 200nl games?
poker,3czv3y,vethlock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:05:04 2015 UTC,anything above 50nl is all rake back regs. Terrible games everywhere.

I've read there are a lot of rakeback BE grinders at 200nl for the rake race thing they have, but not exactly worried as they're definitely not sickos. Might be cool to try out. Anything less than 50nl seems to have decent volume and a lot of shortstacks."

poker,3czv3y,SoundsOfChaos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"im fairly new, only been playing 3 months but for the most part 30bb/100 is not sustainable. im not even sure what all-in EV line means in my tracker, can you explain?"
poker,3czv3y,akaPeanutButter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Lets say I get it in with AA on a low board of 2 5 6 9 rainbow and my opponent calls with KK. I have 95 % equity in this spot. If I lose this pot due to a 2 outer, my winnings would go down with one buy in. (assuming 100 BB effective stack)    But, this is not supposed to happen. The all in EV line goes up in this spot, because you got it in as a favorite. It basically shows you your winnings if luck wasnt involved.     in the spot as we talked about above the all in EV line would go up with 95 % of the pot because thats how much equity we had."
poker,3czv3y,AllTooNew,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"Your EV line doesn't show you your winnings as if luck is not involved. It only shows you what your winnings based on the hands you guys got all in with. That's a pretty stupid way to look at poker. Also, ""luck"" is much more than winning when you get all in. You were ""lucky"" your opponent had KK in that spot and not 55.  Don't worry about your EV line that much. Your EV line is only going to show you based on the exact hand your opponent had in that situation, but the quality of your play is actually measured much different and with many more variables. Worry about how well you are playing and that you are focusing on the right things during hands."

Can anyone explain why when there's an all-in, instead of going into a regular showdown, the dealer makes the turn and river, and then repeat that twice. Does the winner of the bo3 actually win, or is the pot split according to how you did between the 3 shows?"
poker,3czv3y,DASoulWarden,2,Mon Jul 13 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is called ""running it twice"" or 3 times or as many as you want. Basically it's to reduce variance a little bit. Generally each time you run it the person takes that share of the pot(so 1/3 of the total pot)."

poker,3d2zr3,Tulimies,3,Mon Jul 13 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"I think it might be better to x/c flop rather than cbet it. People in 1/1 live love to play ragged aces, so I wouldn't be surprised if someone cold-called a 3-bet from EP with A9o. I would probably x/c flop, x/f turn and if the turn gets x through, block-bet the river so weak aces can't raise and hands worse than ours (like JJ/TT) have some incentive to cry-call. When the A hits all you have is a second-best hand, and second-best hands do better when they go to showdown.  As played, I would x/c turn because the bet was so tiny. I expect to be good almost never, but the possibility that this is some weird bluff and V will often give up OTR. Turns out that was not the case and you should definitely x/f river. I expect this is AK/KK more often than a bluff."
poker,3d2zr3,withoutatrace123,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:55:36 2015 UTC,"No need to post my own response, I agree with all of this. My default player profile at low stakes is that they play too many hands with aces in them, and don't bluff enough. That adds up to playing ace-high flops passively and weakly when I have QQ. QQ is great preflop but on Axx it's just second pair.  It's actually harder to play against good aggro players who handread well."
poker,3d2zr3,jkugelman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:47:58 2015 UTC,Think you have to. There isn't enough money behind unless you were willing to get it all in there. Either cbet the turn or fold to a bet of that size.
poker,3d2zr3,Th3Oscillator,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:10:26 2015 UTC,"I think you should have raised more pre because 1/1 live is pretty soft you want trash hands like Ace rag pay a lot to try to spike an Ace. That said I think you should bet/fold turn and x/fold river. Checking the turn just shows too much weakness for your opponent to bluff you with weaker hands. A JJ TT or even 99 would have played the hand exactly the same like villian did. Also by betting the turn and checking the river, your opponent may check behind on the river scaring that you have an Ace with a better kicker so you get a showdown(which is what you desperately need)"
poker,3d2zr3,joesun1015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:41:24 2015 UTC,So we're turning our hand into a bluff?
poker,3d2zr3,joesun1015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:02:31 2015 UTC,"Not exactly a bluff but you cant show weakness and let weaker hands exploit you. A lot of the times your opponent will have a smaller pocket pair or even air and sense your weakness and take down the pot by applying a lot of pressure. And it all depends on opponent, do you ever think a regular will go broke with top pair small to medium kicker (or even call a 3-bet with a small to medium ace?). If it is a fishy player I suggest you c/c flop c/f turn because they only care about ""I has top pair OMG!"". Against a regular I would suggest the line I suggested there."
poker,3d2zr3,joesun1015,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:48:51 2015 UTC,Well I don't expect JJ or TT to call turn too if we barrel twice so isn't it turning QQ into a bluff? Also we're always in a horrible spot playing 3 bet pot oop with an underpair.

With a big stack i would be trying to play small pots. Definitely use pot control when in a hand with a stack in signficance to yours.

poker,3d1wjw,POKER_SLUT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:03:17 2015 UTC,"That's going to be a huge field and it should be still pretty early in the tournament. Your current stack is going to be a single small blind in a couple of hours.   You have to get really lucky even if you are very good a poker to win one of these things. But if you just want to try and make the money...  I would abuse position while you can. What that means is that while you still have a bigish stack relative to the rest of the table/field and you are last or second to last to act, raise with a much wider range of hands than you normally would (Any suited A, maybe KQ or QJ kind of hands).  When you feel like you have a significant edge, don't try to be clever. Pay attention to the bet sizing of other players and when you have monsters (AA/AK KK/QQ) raise the amount everyone else is raising and then keep betting.  Honestly, this is such a complicated game and it's so early in the tournament that being in 3rd right now means almost nothing (sorry to be so brutal) so trying to give you advice to make the money hours from now when you're not a regular player is really really hard to do.   You could also just completely aggro and bet like a fucking maniac and hope that you win a bunch of hands and keep generating a giant stack. That might be a viable option for you. I dunno. I want to help, but this is a really hard thing to coach someone through when they have never really played cards before.  Oh. and if you got there through the lucky draw - you must have at least played that well enough to win the seat. Use whatever strategy got you that to win the ticket. It has to be better than nothing. Maybe lightning will strike twice."

poker,3d2i4o,RookXPY,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:49:24 2015 UTC,"Strange as this may sound I can think of reasons a good player might open limp there.  Once again, you are probably right with the fold.  However, good/bad comes in a lot of forms with poker.  A ""bad"" tight passive requires a whole different approach than a ""bad"" loose aggro.  And that's before you start factoring in how many poker players play differently before and after the flop.  If you are truly trying to get better you need to spend as much time on Level 2 thinking (what do my opponents previous actions tell me about his current hand) and Level 3 thinking (What do my previous actions make this player think about my current hand).  Which I grant you, at micro-stakes especially, can be a very painful and repetitive task."
poker,3d2i4o,jkugelman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:54:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I dont think level 3 thinking is necessary at level 3 because I dont think many players think level 2."
poker,3d2i4o,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:03:18 2015 UTC,I meant particularly at these stakes I see these very often. I know I completely missed the flop but what are the chances hes just randomly bluffing there. Even when I hit TPGK should I still fold to these donk over-bets? Am I being too nitty?
poker,3d2i4o,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"Folding is fine. You will guaranteed see a huge turn bet, so calling and folding the turn when you don't improve is wasteful; and calling multiple bets is spew.  This is often a flopped pair, any pair, so I'm calling down with TPTK."
poker,3d2i4o,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'd call one. We got the bdfd +blockers to decent tp, A hi might be good and we can still win the hand on good runouts."

poker,3d2i4o,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"Well obviously it depends on the turn. Jacks we can check and call most rivers, A we bet, T/K we check or bet, depending on the speed of his check, absolute bricks we can bet 1/2 and give up, anything that connects more to the board we can check behind. On runouts that don't change the texture much we can check it down as our A has decent showdown."

poker,3d2i4o,FootofGod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"Acting quick is fine. Just be careful about how quick your first action on each street is. If you sometimes act instantly and sometimes think for a bit that may be a tell.  For example when somebody bets really quickly each street that's often a sign that their hand value hasn't changed. If the board runs out with blanks, that doesn't mean much. But when the texture changes each street, it means a lot.  Like if somebody bets, I call, then they instantly barrel a turned ace or flush card, that's suspicious. They're probably bluffing because if they actually hit the turn they'd think about it for a second. Also if they didn't hit the turn, they might pause and think about whether they should bet or check the scare card.  And then if they instantly bet a different scare card on the river, like now the board pairs or a 4-straight appears. Yeah, suspicious."

I folded in this situation as still many others behind me. Is a fold there too tight? Results show that I made a bad bad decision.
poker,3d1um4,nicetrytheresport,8,Sun Jul 12 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"its online poker/bovada so ""Is a player ever doing this without AA?""....yes"
poker,3d1um4,StealtheDeal,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:12:21 2015 UTC,This is correct. I see a lot of players re raise with any pocket pair and shove/call shoves with any pocket pair.  literally yesterday 14 people left in the 3k 11 dollar turbo this guy had 800k chips and was way in the lead.  Lost it by shoving 3 times in a row with 33 a7 55.    Op I'd be getting it in. If he has aa that is just bad luck.
poker,3d1um4,blade55555,5,Sun Jul 12 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"The size of the buyin being outside of your normal bankroll shouldn't factor into your decision at all.    If the player is unusually active and aggressive, you have to give him a wider range than just AA here - AKs, QQ as you suggest at the very least, and I'd probably throw in JJ+ and AKo.  He may also know that you think he's playing LAG and thus are prone to 4bet him lighter, so he might be hoping to fold out your hand to deny you the equity of what he thinks is likely a flip with something like 99, TT, or AQ.  You have 56 BB and KK.  If he has AA, he has AA.  Get it in."
poker,3d1um4,MonkeyShaman,3,Sun Jul 12 21:39:56 2015 UTC,Have KK?  G.I.I.
poker,3d1um4,peckx063,3,Sun Jul 12 21:22:00 2015 UTC,"this is not remotely close to being a fold. his range is probably something like AQs+, AKo+, JJ+ but could possibly be even wider."
poker,3d1um4,yourstupidface,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:54 2015 UTC,To be instantly 5bet jamming nearly 60bb? It might be QQ+/AK but I really doubt AQs or JJ is in there

poker,3d1um4,yourstupidface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:13:10 2015 UTC,No. Are people really that spazzy in $162s there?
poker,3d1um4,RudolfKGB,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:15:02 2015 UTC,"a) I would hardly qualify that range as ""spazzy"" b) the 100k field is ridiculously soft. tons of gambler fish play it because they want to bink a huge score, and they don't have something silly like BRM to stop them from spending that much on one buyin."
poker,3d1um4,yourstupidface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:26:26 2015 UTC,I'd say it's pretty spazzy if you're 5betting JJ or worse when you could have just saw a flop and played it from there. You don't block anything better and are basically hoping to have a flip where you are slightly in front.
poker,3d1um4,RudolfKGB,3,Mon Jul 13 02:36:44 2015 UTC,This is a snap call in my book. Too many people over value Aj aq etc and rarely have aces. Especially bovada...
poker,3d1um4,blufenuf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:14:37 2015 UTC,4 bet sizing is pretty bad here. Pretty sure a similar spot came up and /u/berryguns suggested flating to play a pot with a low spr or 4 bet to 1250 and fold to massive shoves.   Could still be a call on bovada though people spaz a lot.
poker,3d1um4,Spewymcgewy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"The difference for that was it was the main event playing nearly 3x as deep after hero opened pretty big and got 3bet big UTG vs BTN rather than MP vs BTN. Ranges are definitely wider here, though flatting and playing a smaller pot OOP can't be awful."

poker,3d2mw8,niggysmallz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"Expect everyone to call with junk.   Play the top end of your range.   Position is just as important in limit as it is in no-limit.   Don't go looking for spots to bluff.   Value-raise top pairs and better.   Pay very close attention to direct pot odds. I found that when I first started playing limit, I thought I was always getting good odds to call. I wasn't. Keep a mental note of what the odds are to improve for your hand if you think you are behind. Follow those %'s religiously. In lmit poker your stack dwindles very quickly without you noticing if you continue to make marginal calls.  Don't feel entitled to win the pot just because you had the best hand on the flop. People will call down with garbage and will suck out on you from time to time. Just smile and muck your cards. Don't go on tilt no matter how much you're raging inside.

poker,3d1r7h,ljump12,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:31 2015 UTC,"Hand 3 I am not really sure why we are 3-betting the flop.   First, it drives out all the bluffs UTG has which we are crushing.   Second, it allows SB to fold whatever nonsense they have instead of calling the flop raise and maybe a turn bet.   Third, if you want to look at the issue of balance then the 3b kind of makes no sense because what are you bluffing or semi-bluffing with in this spot? You look so strong here.  We have nothing to protect against (unless turn is a Q we are totally happy getting it in) and the SPR is such that there is zero problem getting stacks in. Either someone bets turn and we ship or if checked to we bet turn and ship river.   If someone has KQ or whatever we stack them regardless but if someone has air or IDK 99 then they might make a big mistake on the turn so calling > 3b IMO."
poker,3d1r7h,myimportantthoughts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:00:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks... Sort of felt that way myself after the fact. The raise is so strong that the only thing calling that strong of a 3b is something that is beating me. If there ever was a dry flop for calling this is it -- just wasn't sure if we're ever letting it go 3 ways to turn with AA.   EDIT:: Not quite sure if I agree with us stacking KQ. If I were UTG, I'm probably folding KQ. Probably stacking off AQ here against Hero (me),  but that raise is so strong I think it's fairly easy to fold KQ. Which again, makes the raise probably a bad decision"
poker,3d1r7h,myimportantthoughts,2,Sun Jul 12 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm. UTG limping and SBs shortstack suggest they are fun players and fun players don't like folding TP.  Having said you look incredibly strong so they could fold something like Q8. Cant imagine a fun player folds AQ IMO even if you 3b shove flop.  Not sure about KQ and QJ.  But yeah, if you think something like Q9 can find a fold on the flop then flatting is mandatory. It is just criminal to let someone fold a queen on the flop."
poker,3d1r7h,SkeetRag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:00 2015 UTC,I find it funny even trying to put utg on a 'reasonable limp/call range'.
poker,3d1r7h,SkeetRag,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"If this is bovada, you should specify, it does matter.   H1- We could consider betting more here, as a l/c range is indicative of a weaker passive player, and we want value now while we can get it.  As played turn is fine, dude was folding with air probably. We could bet 25 to entice him to call so we can jam river, but it's 100% fine vs a fish to bet bet bet larger.   H2- Probably cb our 2 overs bdsd, we also block some of his JX and we'd love to get an A/ small PPs to fold now and or turn, while we have no d we can rep a lot of cards on turn. As played seems fine.   H4 - I think I like flatting here. With SUCH a dry board with so few draws, we can let him spaz out, even though him being loose passive makes it seem unlikely that this is light."

If someone bets 425 and you put in 1025 some places will count that as a call and you'll have to correct them though, since people often put in the extra 25 or w/e to make it easier to make change."
poker,3d0b2r,jkugelman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:25:52 2015 UTC,"If you put it more than enough chips to make an actual raise, even w/o verbalizing it, most places will consider that a raise. If the bet is say 100, and you put out 180 meaning to raise but don't verbalize it, it will just be a call. Easiest way, just say the word ""raise"" when you plan on raising and you'll never have the confusion. That way, if you do the 180 over the 100 bet, but say raise, it should be brought up to a min raise since you announced a raise."
poker,3d0b2r,MrMogz,4,Sun Jul 12 12:29:14 2015 UTC,180 should be ruled a minraise to 200 since it's more than half a legal raise (150).

poker,3d1c9s,SportsGame,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:26 2015 UTC,"These are really two different questions. You shouldn't play a re-buy event the same as a single buy-in.  Single buy-in: I will register in the first two or three levels, but never later than that. This is for standard online tournaments; there may be exceptions for larger tournaments with longer levels and better blind structures where you can register later and still be fine.  Re-buy: Your goal in a re-buy is to double up as quickly as possible and then play solid. People will be shoving pre-flop with a wide range during the re-buy period. I'd late register for a re-buy a level or two later than a single buy-in, but at some point the blinds (and more importantly, your opponents' chip stacks) make late entry into a re-buy very -EV. An important rule: If your bankroll won't support several buy-ins to a re-buy event, then don't play it."

I'm rolled for about 2-3 buy ins every time I play this tourney. Should I be playing it or should I be rolled for more?
poker,3d1c9s,bouncingsouls,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"How long is the re-buy period? Personally, I'm probably playing that with 4-6 buy-ins. You're only starting with 50BB (100BB if you can re-buy immediately which I would do if you can), and blind levels are pretty short for a live tournament so you really want to double up early on."

Re-raise their button raise to try and blind steal too
poker,3d1eak,airal3rt,6,Sun Jul 12 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"There are two very common leaks spotted among inexperienced players:   Overvaluing TPTK Undervaluing TPTK   You can't look at TPTK in a vacuum and say ""yeah I'm never folding this,"" but there are situations when you should be trying to get it all in and there are situations when you should just fold the flop. Being able to identify these situations is crucial to taking your game to the next level.  You seem to have a grasp on what to do when you have reads, so I'll focus this post on readless opponents.  TPTK is a very strong hand against a calling range. If you bet and villain calls, there are so many hands in his range (draws, worse pairs, worse kickers, etc) that you're just crushing him and I have no problem with continuing to bet unless the board gets gross. If you slow down for ""pot control"" you're just pissing away money. You don't get strong hands like this often, make the most of it.  On the other hand, against a raising range, your hand is basically a bluff catcher at this point. You can beat his bluffs, but it's difficult to beat his value-raises (sets, two pair) because it's unlikely he's raising a worse pair or worse kicker. Are there any bluffs on the board like 2 to a flush or 2 to a straight? If so I recommend calling down on dry runouts. If the board is super dry then it's unlikely he's bluffing, so I'm more likely to fold.  In general, even without reads you should be able to effectively put someone on a range of hands given action that happened pre- and post- flop and evaluate how that range fairs against your TPTK. If you're ahead, continue. If not, throw it away."
poker,3d1eak,Slinger17,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:39 2015 UTC,"This explanation was very helpful. I think I have been too focused on pot-size control in these situations in the past, instead of backing my ability to recognize whether or not I'm likely to be ahead of the villain and playing accordingly."
poker,3d1eak,withoutatrace123,5,Mon Jul 13 04:40:13 2015 UTC,Default line against passive villains should be bet/bet/bet and re-evaluate when facing a raise or other aggression.
poker,3d1eak,gujupike,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"Villain flatting the flop and turn with no obvious draws on boards wouldn't make you hesitate to barrel again on the river? I certainly would have no problem doing this against a passive villain who has shown a willingness to call down with mediocre hands, but I don't know if I would fire another value bet on the river against an unknown villain, because you'd have to throw it away to a decent-sized raise."
poker,3d1eak,Spursfan14,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"I would value bet river if all draws miss.  I think there are times villain will wake up with a random 2 pair but more often than not you are missing value by not value betting the river.   I used to bet/bet/check if I got called down but I'm beginning to realize how much value I'm losing over time. For example if your river bet is going to be 1/2 pot and you do it every time and once in a while they call with weaker hands, sometimes they fold, and other times they raise with a random 2 pair I am ok with that. If they pop me on the riverI muck. Sometimes you might get bottom 2 pair to fold but most of the time you get a call with a weaker hand. Over time I see that as a profitable play"
poker,3d1eak,CZheaven,3,Mon Jul 13 16:13:20 2015 UTC,"If I have position then I'll just call depending on how aggressive they get. If I'm facing big bets of pot size or more on multiple streets I'll probably lay it down because there's a real risk you're up against over-pairs or two pair+.  I wouldn't tend to raise them either unless their bets are a lot smaller than the amount I want to add to the pot because that's going to chase away a lot of the top pair weaker kicker type hands, and realistically those + draws are the only things you're getting value from."

Well, his range is polarized to QJ or nothing here (or 2 pair which is essentially nothing in regards to your hand). Would have to be read based if you can make this call, or if it's a player that doesn't get out of line, sigh fold that he made RR Broadway on you.    Edit after update: since V showed that bluff I'd be a lot more inclined to make the call here, you're near the top of you're range and he probably raises 2 pair like this. Don't really see him having KK/TT/AA here almost ever.   Hans 2: Bet bigger on the flop, bet bigger on the turn (you bet like 40% PSB both streets when they should be like 75%). In a normal game it would be easier to deduce V's liklihood of having the A, like online most people will 3bet AK, which is the hand to be most worried about here, but at 1/2 I see it flatted often. You block AQ hard, and AJ/ is just pretty unlikely unless he's very stationy. Not sure if 9x ships it in here, but it might due to stack size. That Being said, I'm calling here on the river since he's so short, expecting to lose a good chunk of the time, but expect to see a random 2 pair sometimes as well.    Hand 3: It's silly to say go bigger than 7.5x, but I'd probably bump it like 10x being in SB here. Probably just lead flop, seems like the game is very SS, which is kind of lame. Since he's a fish you were probably getting sucked out on this hand no matter if you went up to 10-12x pre anyways, since he's never folding TPGK OTF.    Analyzing live 1/2 hands is sometimes hard/pointless because the players are just as bad as 2NL spewtards."

I snapped him off and was literally in utter disbelief when he tabled QJ.  Hand 2: My opponent was a regular and I was friendly with him. Before I folded I told him I had to lay down a huge hand because I knew he had the ace. he would have checked behind if he had any less because he is the overly friendly type to play soft toward me because I am a fellow regular. I showed him my hand and mucked to the rest of the table (no one asked to see?) and he showed me A4dd. chasing flush draw but hit the four card nuts.

As played, I wouldn't have any issue with folding because he isn't bluffing. It's such a small shove but he's not value betting anything you beat except like TT.

As played I call river as you're getting a great price and if it isn't Td (ten of diamonds*) he should have a fair amount of bluffs in his range.  Hand 3: I'd probably raise a little bigger preflop. Definitely cbet flop. As played I think I like raising flop depending on the depth of your stacks.  It seems that you're playing a bit too passively, which is the most common leak for many liver players."

poker,3czpkg,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:54:26 2015 UTC,"I prefer check/calling turn. You still have a good bit of equity vs. flushes with the Ac and if you get raised it's kind of a gross spot.  I feel like river decision is very read-dependent. Have you seen him take this line with any bluff/value hands?  There aren't a ton of value hands that you beat. 88 and 22 both take this line, and so do flushes. Qx is the only value hand you're ahead of, and I don't think there's a lot of air in his range."

poker,3czpkg,withoutatrace123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"It could easily be QT/QJ. Also the A/K/Qc are all blocked so V can't be playing too many flushes like this. Say he plays SC flushes and Qx like this. We beat 8 combos of trips and lose to 10 combos of flushes/full houses, assuming he wouldn't raise a set OTF.

poker,3czmeg,Touch_Of_Red,2,Sun Jul 12 05:56:49 2015 UTC,I know i formatted this hand incorrectly but what were my mistakes?
poker,3czmeg,SwainIsABird,6,Sun Jul 12 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty bad myself but I can give it a try.  Anyway, your call PF is fine. On the flop, you have a decent draw and two overs. Betting is one of the last things I'm thinking of right here honestly, although some people play draws aggressively, I don't see a reason to do so here. Also it's not like you were the PF aggressor so if you'd have hit the board checking to villain generally gets you more value and villain should know that so this bet doesn't represent strength at all in my eyes. So my first question is why do you bet?  Then you get raised. 1.80$ in the pot. 0.65$ to call. You need 4 to one odds to call with a FD here but villain is indicating strength so I guess you can account for implied odds making you an extra 0.80$ if you do hit your flush. For me it's a close call between fold or calling here. That said, you dont even have the nuts then, villain might have AdTd which is unlikely but is not impossible at all. But what do you think he's holding here to raise you with? A set or an overpair that want to end the pot here might make sense to me, or AJ who thinks you're trying to steal the pot. Heck even AK without Ad is possible, and you're still behind vs that hand. Did you really raise thinking he is holding air here most of the time? If yes that's just wrong, if no then why did you reraise?   After your reraise to $3.10$ you are representing real strength as opposed to the donkbet earlier, and villain shoves on you after you rep strength like this. Although you rep so high he still thinks he has you beat and shoves. You are absolutely never ever ever ahead here but you might get odds to call. I'm not on my pc now so I'll check and edit later. But I doubt you calculated your odds and pot odds, did you still think he had air here and you were ahead? There are so ridiculously few hands you're ahead of here. I'll be back with calculations on the call.  The biggest mistake is definetely reraising villain on the flop. You check/call only if you get the odds to do so. If you hit your flush you raise and take his stack if you don't you fold river. Foolproof."
poker,3czmeg,The-Doctor-94,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to poker, but your analysis makes a lot of sense and matches up to everything I've been learning lately. Betting was definitely silly, as he didn't show strength pf, and he literally only has the flush draw to his advantage (based on the Villains betting it seems the worst hand he could have is AA or KK, with two pair or a set very likely).   So yeah, I think you're right in this case."

poker,3czmeg,Spreek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"Lots of good thoughts here already. Just thought I'd add a few things   In general, playing draws aggressively becomes less attractive the deeper you get. With a high SPR, you have very good implied odds and your hand plays well seeing more streets.  Stacking off 100 BB on this flop is alright if you have an aggro dynamic with your opponent and fold equity. Stacking off 200 BB is a huge mistake (especially calling off as you don't even have fold equity) as ranges get tighter -- and many of the single pair hands that you are doing decent against are not stacking off. You always need to think about why you are betting or raising. The 3 bet on the flop cannot possibly be for value (as you are behind any sane range for 4 bet stacking off 200 BB -- hell you're even behind a lot of bluffs), but it is also has far too much value to bluff."

Arguably your cousin destroyed it himself because he did something that he knew casinos frown upon.  But that being said, being banned from the WSOP is not the same as having a busted poker career.  You can live your whole life and never play a WSOP.  Frankly if you are properly rolled to play the WSOP, you don't need to play it in order to make a comfortable living in the US or Canada.  So what are some options?  1) Play in the WPT or the EPT.  There are more tournaments than the WSOP.  2) Play online, you can make enough money playing 200NL or 500NL if you are good enough.  4bb/100 when you grind can be 20-40 bucks an hour if you are solid.

poker,3cz391,iamcrazyjoe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:48:06 2015 UTC,Huh? Small flushes and sets shrink up SO fast when 4th flush card hits. You aren't getting much more in after it hits unless MAYBE vs Qd

poker,3cz391,RudolfKGB,0,Sun Jul 12 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Okay thanks a lot for the reply. I don't usually call bets from people in late position with K9o, but when I do this is what happens hahaha."
poker,3cz391,kaellinn18,2,Sun Jul 12 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have played this hand in the first place. K9o is not a great starting hand, especially with a raise in front of you. That being said, once you were in you were priced for the flop call, but I would have folded the turn."
poker,3cz391,RudolfKGB,4,Sun Jul 12 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"We're getting significantly better odds on the turn, in addition we know villain has something and probably wants to get to showdown even if another diamond hits. We can't call flop and fold turn unless there's some reason we need to save that second 200 chips but not the first 200."

poker,3cz391,kaellinn18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"Calling a 30% pot sized bet means we're calling 0.3 pots into 1.3 pots so we need to make 0.3 pots back out of 1.6 pots total = 18.75% equity for breaking even.

poker,3czrtp,Bonesnapcall,2,Sun Jul 12 07:01:37 2015 UTC,"Pre: Standard  Flop: Standard  Turn: I very much dislike the flat call. Villain's range is just so draw-heavy on this board that I prefer 3betting and trying to get it in with our top two + flush draw. In a 5-way pot, I seriously doubt any sets are ever flat calling that super wet board.  I feel it's significantly more likely he picked up a bunch of outs with that K, something like AQTx with spades or diamonds, or perhaps a diamond draw to go with his spade draw.   River: as played you have to call. There are so few value combos at this point it's more likely a bluff than anything. You only need 22% equity to call and I can't think of a possible range that you don't have that against."

If you looked at the wiki for detail you should have found the instructions on how to install the software.  this document should also provide what you need to know https://github.com/sacarlson/pokerth_accounting/blob/master/instruction_manual.pdf that was also in the wiki.  Hippy80 at this point in testing we aren't using real money only worthless generated cyrpo currency issues we call CHP (stands for chips)  that is presently used as a public score keeping method.  later if we see it works we can point to steller issues of true assets but we can start with very small pots of as little or smaller than 1 cent just to prove it can be done.  later when we add the mental poker shuffle algorithm and Stellar built in uncentralized escrow contracts we should be able to play securely even with big money real assets.  but that may take some time like maybe weeks.  Even when we start using real assets your real name nor your credit card need never be attached as it is all performed on uncentralized crypto currency and nicknames.  You simply purchase crypo currency to and from one of the thousands of methods available to enter and exit into your desired fiat currency.  Stellar has many gateways that can handle this for you.  For now lets just see if it works.  As it states in the wiki I can be found to chat in real time on freenode IRC  #pokerth where we can all meet and discuse questions and problems and make plans to run tests in real time.

KK, 66, 37, 78. Why didn't he fire a cbet? If he had a K he'd certainly bet, a flush draw would likely cbet and big pairs smaller than K would likely cbet too. when you spike your set on the turn and he checks again, he's basically repping that he's given up on the hand.....then he C/R. Of the hands that beat you, what would have taken that line? All of them.  Now what hands do you beat that could C/R there, 2pairs? So if he had 1 pair on the flop why didn't he cbet?

I also think he is betting 66 most of the time as he can get value from Kx or a flush draw. I really think only KK is checking often on that flop.

poker,3cxqut,Witcrew,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"Okay listen dude. I'm not even going to read any of the comments down below. I'm going to give it to you straight and please take this advice.  The only way you are beat is if he has a set of kings, 6's, or a straight.   He raised preflop tho, so I doubt he has 3 7 or 7 8. I would say 7 8 suited IS POSSIBLE if he was the cutoff before you? <---I can see myself raising 7 8 suited behind the button to make a play.  He DID check to you on the flop though, so maybe he has a set and wants you to bet out to him, or maybe he is scared of that king because he has something like QJ (TOTAL AIR)  This is my logic:  There is 8K in the pot. You add another 3800 into the pot. He raises to 12k. He was probably scared of the king on the flop which is why he checked, meaning he has pocket 9's or 8's.   I think he has pocket 8's because he now has the best logical hand other than kings and is drawing to a straight. You push all in and get him off that, or he calls and you have to hope the poker gods are on your side.  The guy also JUST sat down at the table. He might be trying to gain power at the table. Put him in his place and go over the top. You still have outs if he has a straight. If he has a set over set...wellll.....thats just shitty man but it happens.  Hope you give me the results. Would love to know.  You shouldn't fold sets most of the time, so you are probably golden."
poker,3cxqut,Witcrew,2,Sun Jul 12 01:52:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with some things and disagree with other things you've said but in the end, I shoved he called and won with 87o"
poker,3cxqut,Frisky_Pilot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's unfortunate. Because he was one of the last ones to act preflop, he was trying to make a move with 87 and steal those blinds. Since he checked both the flop and turn, then re-raised...it's a good assumption he COULD have that, but as one other guy mentioned you can't play scared poker and wait until you have quads. I think calling the 12k would of been acceptable to see if you pair the board and with 30K or so left you still have enough wiggle room for the tourney if you don't pair the board.   Don't let this bother you. You still had outs going to the river and sometimes you get a cooler hand. He just happened to come out on top that time."
poker,3cxqut,withoutatrace123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"He opened the pot for more than 3xbb with 87o having just sat at the table I think it's fair to say that this kind of in-depth analysis is useless against players like him. He's a 40yr old guy who wants to play some cards. He doesn't know what he is supposed to do pre flop, he bets big when he makes his hand. That's all you need to know about these guys. GG, ul."
poker,3cxqut,RIsurfer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:57:44 2015 UTC,Most likely this is KK/54s. I think 78s cbets flop with a gutshot. KK might slowplay. Sometimes this is a really weak club draw like 98cc. Call and call all non-club rivers.

I sent this hand to Sensei Somerville and he responded with this...  @JasonSomerville in this vacuum you really can't fuck it up, both options are fine. unlucky that he had a better hand imo  To everyone who said I should prob fold, I can't help but feel your thinking is swayed by the fact that when someone posts a HH like this one it's prob pretty obvious I lost this hand somehow.  Easier to say fold that way, even tho it would prob be pretty terrible to do so."

I think it comes down to people being impatient, they know they are supposed to be playing tighter than in 6 max, but they just can't help themselves. Also another thing that bugs the fish and makes them donk out is the fact that individual players are going to have less action on 9 max, while the table as a whole is going to have more action on 9 max, people see this and think they are not playing enough and overcompensate by calling with trash."
poker,3cz63v,Of_Chiefs,-1,Mon Jul 13 05:19:09 2015 UTC,There's less variance in full ring than 6max. If you have a better winrate at full ring than 6max then you should be playing full ring as a default.

Runouts are runouts, winrates/hands is a graph that has a std dev irrespective of players per table, coolers per 100k are the same, I see no reason why the variation deminishes. Sure you can look at the extrema and say HU is higher variance as ranges are drastically wider, and 20 max your starting range is going to have to be much tighter, making hand reading easier, but that is only 1 dimension of quantifiable variance, making it seem the difference between 6 and 9 players inconsequential.  tl;dr, seems hard to believe, but makes sense if you use the lens of  tighter ranges, more fish, less aggressive players make them encounter less tricky spots."

But basically preflop we have a decent hand and the almost min 3 bet by the guy seemed ""weird"" so I 4 bet but maybe that was a first mistake? AKs plays decently preflop with 3 players if the original raiser calls?   And on the flop should I have bet? I planned to check call if he bets under the pot but he open shoves a little over the pot and I'm getting 3:1 odds to call. So I thought he was shoving because he sensed weakness in my check. I have two overcards and a backdoor straight and flush draw. And now writing this I didn't think what he should have here. Maybe a draw like QT or maybe a JT or QK or a pocket pair and sometimes a set and QQ too. AA or KK would have put it all in preflop.  But should I have folded on the flop? Am I beat way too many times in situations like these in the future. And what about the preflop, just call or 4bet?  Thanks."

poker,3cwaik,ILikeRaisinsAMA,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Another hand I would appreciate feedback on... could I have got away from my hand here?  2¢/4¢ 9-handed NLHE. Villain is UTG ($3.92)  and limps. UTG+1 limps. Folds round till Hero on BTN ($3.54) dealt AsKs. Hero raises to 20¢. Only Villain calls. Pot is 48¢  Flop comes 9h5hTc.  Villain checks. Hero bets 37¢. Villain calls.  Turn comes Ac with pot $1.17 (Hero has $2.97 left, Villain has $3.39 left). Villain checks. Hero bets 93¢. Villain calls.  River comes 2c, pot is $2.92. Villain checks. Hero bets all in $2.04. Villain calls and shows Ah5c.  How should I have played this? I could only put him on something like Jack Ten, a mid pocket pair or a busted flush draw. I regret the bet on the river because I guess only hands that are beating me are calling?"
poker,3cwaik,anonymous7,3,Sat Jul 11 12:59:22 2015 UTC,"Raise bigger preflop. Not a big mistake since you're in position with a hand that's not going to do too poorly multi-way, but it's a strong hand, so make 'em pay.  The flop is so wet I strongly think you should check back the flop. You'll get some folds, but not enough, and you have too little chance to improve to anything significant - i.e. anything that's actually happy getting more chips in.  The turn bet is not too bad - it's a price setting bet. You have to understand when you make this bet that it's the last you're putting in. If you get checkraised, you have to fold. If Villain donks the river, you have to fold.  On the river, I think it's best to check back. The reason is that while Villain will often have hands that you can beat, these are the hands he'll be folding when you bet, while he'll call with mostly hands that beat you. Be happy that you usually have the best hand at this point... but not by much - not enough to bet it.   I could only put him on something like Jack Ten, a mid pocket pair or a busted flush draw   Okay, so now you know! Here's some logic behind Villain's play:   He's priced in preflop On the flop, he calls because he hit something and ""it's hard to make a pair"" On the turn, he has a strong hand but not strong enough to start checkraising. It's best just to let you get the chips in. Same on the river.   If you look at it this way, hopefully you can see: it doesn't make sense for Villain to play it any other way at any point!"

poker,3cwaik,SoulsApart,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:13:58 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of confused by the preflop action. Limp limp player 3 min raises? You make it .20, and the first guy calls and everyone else folds? But regardless that sizing is too small. Pot should be .02 sb + .04 bb + .20 utg(villain) + .04 utg1 + .20 btn(hero)? I'm not sure who puts in .08. If there's 2 limpers and then it's to you I think .20 is fine but if there's a min raise in there I'm going .32-.36.   Then as played a lot of people will advocate a check back on this flop. I think a small (under half pot) c bet is good and makes our hand less face up. If we are checking back, we need to check back some over pairs for balance which I don't think a lot of people do. Anyways, good bet turn, it's a good card to bluff on, so thinking players MAY call with a 2nd pair type hand. Plus we want to protect our hand and get some value. River is close but I would probably check back. Our hand is so face up and villain didnt fold when an A hit on turn. Plus the club draw came in. We get value from some AQ and AJ but value own ourselves vs everything else. What would call that we beat? Only those 2 hands."
poker,3cwaik,anonymous7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"The bet under half pot and then overpair balance part is only if this is a hand we 3 bet pre. I'm not sure exactly what happened.  And also how can he be on a busted flush draw? A backdoor flush draw came in, and he didnt elect to bluff. We're not getting value on river from a busted flush draw cause he can't call with that hand he can only bluff."

poker,3cwaik,anonymous7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"I think a small (under half pot) c bet is good and makes our hand less face up.   Of course, having a very weak hand, getting more money in the pot like this make it look like what it isn't: a strong hand! But why do you want to make it look like what it isn't? If this bet is called (otherwise what difference does it make what it looks like?), what's your plan? To keep bluffing because now you have made your hand look strong when it isn't, so bluffs should be successful? But with every additional bet you make, your opponent's hand also looks stronger, which makes your bluffs less likely to succeed!   If we are checking back, we need to check back some over pairs for balance   No you don't. This is 2c/4c.  Also, I can tell you from experience that in near-GTO play, there's nothing wrong with checking back a solely weak range on the flop. Take a free card - it's free! And when you improve, your ""weak range"" will get attacked and you will reap the profit."
poker,3cwaik,obeydadawg,2,Sat Jul 11 14:04:55 2015 UTC,"AK isn't weak on a 5910 board it's gonna be ahead a lot of the time. It just opens the door for a lot of other plays on future streets. Checking back SCREAMS AK and AQ. Any decent player will play perfectly vs us which is something I hate. I want people making mistakes. Yeah it's safer/more passive but what happens when an A or K hits on turn? It's not like we make money in that situation because our hand is face up. I don't think we're EVER getting attacked when an A or K hits on the turn. Yeah we might abuse a drooler but we're going to be abusing those people anyways. Lets be hard to play against. It's not a ""weak range"" it's a face-up range especially if we're not balancing with strong hands. When I can figure out what you have by the flop, you're never in good shape by turn and river.  The hey it's micro stakes we should play sub-optimally because people suck so bad here is bad logic IMO. There are some thinking players at these stakes, even if they have big flaws in their game. Is anyone really attacking when an A or K hits on turn and we checked back flop with likely 2 overs? Doubtful. I actually check-back KJ KQ here a bit but AK still beats and dominates a lot of hands that will call. KJ KQ QJ AJ J8 Axhh etc. AND we can push off 88-22 on almost any turn with a c-bet on flop. We can't if we check back(as easily).  Now, all that said, I think there is a huge difference in what I would do in this spot if this is a 3-bet pot pre, vs just a raise vs 2 limpers. And there was some confusion in the OP. I still don't love checking back this flop vs. limpers because I think we make 0 mistakes once we make a c-bet and they fold or continue. If they continue and we spike an A or K, obviously we're in great shape. And we're c-betting A's and K's on the turn as a bluff anyways when we don't have AK, so it's a good spot to bet twice regardless. If the board pairs or a draw comes in, we can give up. That's how I would play it, and in a 3-bet pot I'm checking back almost 0% of my range here without reads. I would just adjust size based on what I'm holding to get a desired effect. But I definitely would consider checking back AA or KK if villain is aggro, especially if it was a dryer board."
poker,3cwaik,anonymous7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:11:00 2015 UTC,"Checking back SCREAMS AK and AQ. Any decent player will play perfectly vs us which is something I hate.   No, it just doesn't. It might look like that to you, but then you're going to be the one making lots of mistakes against people who check back any other hand in spots like this.   Yeah it's safer/more passive but what happens when an A or K hits on turn? It's not like we make money in that situation because our hand is face up. I don't think we're EVER getting attacked when an A or K hits on the turn. Yeah we might abuse a drooler but we're going to be abusing those people anyways.    A common mistake at the micros is to put Villain on too tight a range. They show up with crazy shit again and again.  An even worse mistake is to expect Villain to put you on too tight a range. They show themselves to be not thinking about what you have, again, and again, and again. Sometimes they even know what you have, but can't help paying you off because they ""just can't believe you'd have rivered them again"".  And what I'm saying isn't specific to the micros either. Regardless of the stakes, checking back a lot of hands that have a small chance of significant improvement here is just good, solid poker.  At the higher stakes, if you do this, your thinking opponents will realise that literally any turn card could have improved you - or at least make you more sticky with your showdown value hands. At the lower stakes, and/or if people aren't that smart, they will instead pay you off."
poker,3cwaik,obeydadawg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:41:32 2015 UTC,"Checking back says to your opponent ""I have showdown value, but not a strong enough hand to value bet, so I'll take a free card."" Which is fine, but it turns our hand pretty face up. If we're not balancing here, eventually we're gonna be making mistakes vs. thinking players. These are the kinds of hands bad regs get stuck on IMO. It's fine to check back this spot, but it's so obvious what we have if we're not thinking about balancing. And I know for a fact we're advocating a c-bet if we hold AA or any value hand here, so how are we balanced? We're more balanced just turning our hand into a semi-bluff that is the best hand a lot of the time.  It's fine against the fishiest of fish (to check), but dude you're not making any money vs me if the standard play on this board is the checkback when you have 2 overs. I am literally blowing you out of every hand on turn and river if I want to, or more likely, I'm just playing correctly with my holdings. Turn, we hit an A, we value bet, and we get check-raised. Now what? Betting flop makes our turn decision so much easier, AND we actually end up with a lot of value when we do hit. I've been called down with 2nd / 3rd pair before playing this way, because I would barrel bluff those cards if I had air. And it's 2-3 streets of value with an 80%+ hand a lot of the time. Checkback flop gets us 0 streets of value when we do hit, occasionally 1 if we dominate a guy or something.  What's in our checkback range that can withstand a couple bets on this board? j9? Did we raise that pre? J10? I'm betting all my top pairs. 88-77? Can that withstand 2 bets? Top set? I'd bet a set too as the standard. Yeah, if we spike a K or A we can withstand a couple bets but thinking villains aren't bluffing those cards.  So yeah, I guess I just don't agree. That's ABC poker, and we know ABC poker beats fish, but it's not the best poker. The more I think about it I just find more reasons I like betting, and less I like checking. Hoping someone is bad enough to spaz into us or value own himself isn't a good enough reason for me."
poker,3cwaik,anonymous7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"It's fine to check back this spot...   You seem to be agreeing with me.   ... but it's so obvious what we have if we're not thinking about balancing.   This is a weird thing to say. You seem to be saying that what we're thinking about when we act affects what our opponent thinks we have.   you're not making any money vs me if the standard play on this board is the checkback when you have 2 overs   Then you are going to start respecting my cbets, aren't you? Then I can cbet my overcards because it's profitable! Of course we can get into a levelling war. If I can guess what you think my range is better than you can guess my true range, I win. If you can guess my true range better than I think you can, you win. Of course.  My point is:   vs. players who aren't thinking and who you don't have any particular reason to think are over-folding, on a wet flop like this and in position, checking back this kind of hand is a good move vs. players who are thinking, cbetting two overcards means you are cbetting too wide, and they know to call enough that you can't profitably do so, and your bluff will be unprofitable, so again checking back this kind of hand is a good move   If you have a particular read that your opponent will over-fold, or if there are metagame effects in play, then sure, cbet. That should go without saying."
poker,3cwaik,obeydadawg,2,Sun Jul 12 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that I'm thinking about what I think he should be thinking about, whether he is or not who knows, but that's how we develop reads/history.  I think a check back is okay, but it's not my favorite play. A check back is a way to play a tiny pot with decent showdown value, that's fine. A c-bet lets us do so much more though. It's for straight up value half time, and then we can turn it into a bluff on future streets if we want. Some flexibility is ideal for me. My problem with checking back is there's only one kind of hand in your check back range. A weak showdown value hand (mainly A high). That's playing face-up.   Checking back 2 overs is fine, I do it all the time, but I also c-bet them all the time too. In this pot, lets rep an overpair. Why can't we have AA-1010 here? If we check back, we don't have them anymore. If I'm blind vs. blind, or button open vs. blind, I like a check back more, but still would be mixing it up whether I'm c-betting or checking."

I'm not necessarily new /r/poker, I lurk here quite frequently and have learned a lot (I think) from the input given here.  I'm quite new to playing poker though, I started playing online in micro cash games, mainly 1¢/2¢.  I wanted some advice with a particular hand I played, I'm wondering if I played it correctly and if not what could I have changed about it?  Six handed 1¢/2¢, hero on BB with ($2.51) is dealt 7h6c. Folded around to Villain in the CO ($2.84) who raises to $0.06. BTN and SB fold. Hero calls.  Flop comes Ac4s5h. Hero checks. Villain bets $0.10, hero calls.  Turn comes Tc. Hero checks. Villain bets $0.22. Hero reraises to $0.44. Villain calls.  River comes 3c making a straight for hero. Hero checks. Villain bets $0.93. Hero calls.  Villain tables trip aces and quickly sits out of the game.  Did I play this right or was reraising the turn the wrong move? I didn't put my opponent on trip aces because he had been playing quite aggressively throughout the game, especially when he was in middle/late position.   I appreciate any help given!"
poker,3cwaik,obeydadawg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"Nice hand. Let me ask you a couple questions before I give you my full feedback:  what was your purpose for min-raising the turn(did you want a fold or call)?  What would you have done if villain re-re-raised you on turn(which how did he not?!!?!?)?  What would you have done if the river was anything besides a 3 or 8?  That is about the only hand villain value bets river with that you beat. Maybe smaller sets. And what sucks is you're not even good here all the time. I think you get paid on river whether you lead or not with these exact hands, but almost always villain checks back all of his A's and probably a lot of his 2-pairs too. So we should really be leading river if we want AK-A2 to call. But then if we're re-raised we should probably consider folding depending on reads / stack sizes. Tough spot."
poker,3cwaik,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:22:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  My purpose for min-raising the turn was to hopefully induce a fold. He had been opening a lot in late position and then folding to re-raises on either the flop or turn. I had seen this happen a lot at that table and hoped villain would do it again.  If villain 3bet I would have snap folded. I figured he might be bluffing up until that point but if he had 3bet I would have figured he had me beat.  If the river was anything but 3 or 8.. I probably would have folded to villains bet, especially since he called my reraise on the turn.  Yeah I understand that I probably should have bet the river. Given this situation, if I had bet and was reraised, I probably would have folded in that spot. Given his aggresive play throughout the game, I would think he'd have put me all in. My reasoning for checking was to induce the bet, I figured I had the best hand but didn't want to put myself in a position where I'm risking my whole stack. Maybe that's the wrong move, I don't know."
poker,3cwaik,theekarwash,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:23:28 2015 UTC,"Okay. So full analysis, and I HATE this response but it's so often the right response - fold pre. Or 3-bet. Calling is my 3rd option but it's probably not terrible if you're good postflop.  A lot of beginners make this mistake, but a min-raise on the turn is too small if we're trying to make someone fold RudolfKGB touched on why.  If we're 3-bet and we fold (on the flop), we had to fold a hand that hand some equity and was drawing to the nuts and we put more money in the pot that we forfeited? That sucks.  So, plan on river was the check-fold when we miss? We had 8 outs, 2 of which could be dirty. So maybe ~16% equity? ~80% of the time we're just check folding? I don't like that. We just bloated the pot and now we're giving it up almost every time? I can't think of any better play though. Try to push villain off his AK-AJ hands doesn't seem good. And obviously we're folding to a river bet when we miss we can't call with 7 high.  None of that seems great to me. Which is why I'd tell you to fold pre. We're in a tough spot the entire way. I don't think we made a winning play on any street here except river when we hit our 16% equity, and even then we were fortunate that villain had a strong enough hand to value bet, because he's usually not betting that river unless it helped him.  And villain didn't bluff river, he value bet you and probably thought he has the best hand. Check call is okay if we think villain is bluffy but we check raised turn so he has almost no bluffs anymore. Villain is going to have an A or 2p a lot here and check those hands back so we're missing a street of value vs someone who almost certainly has at least a pair of A's at the bare minimum."
poker,3cwaik,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"It's likely going to be a losing play for you to defend your blinds with 76o so I think folding is your best option. Your raise on the turn doesn't achieve anything good, either call or raise bigger. On the river you should just bet, it's unlikely the villain has a flush and they show up with Ax a lot which is probably going to call your bet but should be checking back."
poker,3cwaik,DrWormwaffle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"I defended my blinds this hand because villain had been opening in late position A LOT.   Can you explain why my turn reraise doesn't achieve anything? I understand he might have 3bet me which probably would have made me fold, but is that the only thing wrong with the raise?  I figured on the river I had the best hand but didn't want to put myself in a position where I bet and am reraised all in. Is that the wrong mindset in this situation?"

poker,3cutju,TheKoleslaw,10,Fri Jul 10 23:39:15 2015 UTC,So out of all the tables in the WSOP ME this dealer happens to be on the same table as his accomplice?
poker,3cutju,BerryGuns,5,Sat Jul 11 05:44:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe the dealer's a known slime-ball, and an enterprising player is out to get any kind of edge he can. Like, what are the chances they have AA when you have KK anyway, amirite?"
poker,3cutju,Joeboard,16,Sat Jul 11 08:56:19 2015 UTC,"Someone explain exactly what happened, who and how it helped please."
poker,3cutju,betonlinesucks,30,Fri Jul 10 23:44:59 2015 UTC,"The dealer flashed the bottom card to the player on whom the action is (fuck you English...and your little prepositions too!) in the middle of a hand. It isn't necessarily cheating, but it certainly could be. Either way it's absolutely unacceptable.  edit: apparently the player who was flashed won the pot, some are saying because he knew the bottom card/ace. This is the last thing poker wants. The very appearance of cheating sullies the game and its reputation."
poker,3cutju,Flixsl,24,Fri Jul 10 23:58:27 2015 UTC,A trained dealer does not do that by accident.  He also scans the room to see if he is being watched beforehand.
poker,3cutju,MediocreMatt,11,Sat Jul 11 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Dealers are taught NEVER to turn the stub over, even if there's a cut card on the bottom.  Also, if the dealer accidentally exposes a card, he should announce it and show it to the whole table."

poker,3cutju,DasBaaacon,2,Sat Jul 11 11:26:02 2015 UTC,I have dealt the WSOP for 10+ years and stopped dealing once ceasears group made the money terrible for dealing. I am still in all of the facebook groups for dealers and am still friends with most of the management staff. The only people who deal the series now are A) dealers who want a vacation from their normal job and want to deal the most prestigious event only to find out its terrible for the dealers and will never deal it again. B) break in dealers because honestly as long as you can sling a card to 10 seats they will hire you. C) the unemployable dealers who can not pass background/drug test.   Dealing the WSOP is one of the worst jobs for dealing poker that there is.. The only way they can get enough dealers to deal it is to hire break ins.
poker,3cutju,PsychedSy,3,Sat Jul 11 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"Hopefully not. And most obviously don't most of the time. The point is that it is clearly not impossible that it's accidental. If it was on purpose, it was awfully brazen and obvious. His career as a dealer is probably over instantly...certainly with the WSOP.  I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but absolutely regardless, it was bad. How bad...hopefully the investigation that's apparently underway will tell."
poker,3cutju,Oo0o8o0oO,9,Sat Jul 11 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"Scans room, plays with cards, peels back several from muck, checks watch, brazenly flashes the ace, shuffles muck to hide evidence.

I mean seriously was he doing this often enough that she knew to have her phone out to record it? And nobody said anything? Or she just happened to catch him doing this while seated nowhere near the person she was watching? There's got to be more to this scenario.

The deck is spread face down next to his right hand because all of the community cards have been dealt out so there's no further need for it and the burn cards are underneath the pot.  Shuffling the deck mid-hand would definitely get called out but dealers fiddling with folded cards is fairly common"
poker,3cutju,djfl,2,Sat Jul 11 14:58:32 2015 UTC,On the poker news podcast they brought up dealers a couple times. Basically everyone gets paid the same and it's not great. Good dealers can get (and I'm pulling this from memory of a podcast I half listened to so forgive errors) four times as much dealing cash at any other casino during the summer. They said there were dealers for 10k mixed games that didn't know the rules.
poker,3cutju,DownvotesHyperbole,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"It was awhile back, but I was playing PLO cash back in 2008 at the WSOP and the dealer had no idea how to deal anything besides NLH. I thought they had moved past the whole ""rotate every dealer on the same rotation and into any random game"" thing. Back then dealers for the WSOP also told me some people would clock in and then leave, since it was just pure rotation between games and not a fixed schedule. They'd get paid, and the people in charge wouldn't even realize they weren't there dealing."

poker,3cutju,EntityDamage,2,Sat Jul 11 10:45:56 2015 UTC,Looks like seat 1 made a bet on the river and seat 5 is contemplating a call. The dealer is shuffling the muck cards around and then bends the muck up slightly in seat 5s direction. The implication is that seat 5 saw one or more muck cards. Seems tough though. I don't know.
poker,3cutju,duskhat,12,Sat Jul 11 14:57:36 2015 UTC,It could just be incompetence. I remember reading somewhere that the dealers for the main event are not very good. They male mistakes often regarding rules and will accidentally award the pot to the wrong person.
poker,3cutju,TheSystem_IsDown,20,Sat Jul 11 00:17:21 2015 UTC,No no... He tries to expose the bottom card a lot more slickly at first. You can see him try to bend the deck together.   He realizes that strat isn't working and goes for the ol 'Pretend to check my watch strap but grab the deck first trick'   This was a horrible attempt at gaining a small edge.
poker,3cutju,betonlinesucks,5,Sat Jul 11 00:20:27 2015 UTC,How would the player and dealer collude if they rotate dealers on a regular basis? I'm guessing this kind of thing had been happening at the table for a while if someone felt the need to record it. It just seems like it could be so difficult to work out a deal ahead of time for it to be worth it.
poker,3cutju,NihiloZero,5,Sat Jul 11 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole thing is really weird. Also, why would a dealer cheat in such a stupid way, in the most heavily scrutinized events in the world, to give such a slight advantage?

poker,3cutju,arabjuice,4,Sat Jul 11 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be a deal, more likely if it is cheating, he just happened to be dealing at a table with someone he knows. I think he might have just forgotten that there wasn't a plastic card protecting the bottom of the deck."

poker,3cutju,bouncingsouls,8,Sat Jul 11 01:12:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think I believe this. If he just decided to flash a card just for a random card eliminator, it's likely it wouldn't even be relevant to the situation at hand. Like imagine if he does this and the card is a deuce. What help is that to anyone in the majority of situations.The fact that it's an ace makes this scenario far less likely even than this whole thing just being an accident."
poker,3cutju,SvenKramer123,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. The only situation I can think of is if they were the mucked cards of another player who only just folded on the river. E.g. Player 1 bets, player 2 ums and ahs then folds, dealer exposes these cards from the bottom of the muck and player 3 reasons player 1 likely doesn't have an ace (or whatever) and hero calls.  Still, given that one situation I can think of, this angle is super fucking thin. Not sure I can accuse him of cheating just yet but it will be interesting to see what happens."
poker,3cutju,GOATLin,0,Sat Jul 11 06:01:12 2015 UTC,"Flush where a King high hand would realize he has the nuts instead of thinking he's behind an ace that's actually in the muck.  And if he's doing this intentionally, how often does he expect to get away with this? And why does the person with the camera have the forethought to be ready to film this when the players at his table aren't even thinking to watch him?"
poker,3cutju,kappa11231231231,4,Sat Jul 11 06:11:01 2015 UTC,Yeah but like how does the dealer locate the ace and move it to the bottom of the muck? and if he's that good I'm sure the dealer and player colluding would have a better method of communicating than exposing the nut card to the whole table.
poker,3cutju,k3vk3vk3vin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:14:38 2015 UTC,"I have no idea.

Say someone just folded that hand on the turn or river, the dealer could put that hand at the bottom of the muck.  Now assuming that player called preflop, flop and/or turn  it is likely they paired( or had some piece of) the flop.  Now you are at 50% chance of showing a card relevant to the board.

If MP is playing most hands but opening 10%, when he limp-calls, we can take [55+,A8s+,ATo+] out of his range.  This means the only hands that may be in his range that would beat you otf are 22 and MAYBE 87s if he values suited hands over hands like K3o and Q8o.    The question is, what does he donk?  He seems to be playing every other hand, what hands have you seen him donk bet?  If he's donk betting top pair/mid pair/flush draws you might as well raise to gii on the flop."

What I didn't want, however, was to make it 2.6k, get called by MP and then get squeezed by CO (who was relatively new to the table) when he decides he wants to play but is too short-stacked to flat.   The question is, what does he donk? He seems to be playing every other hand, what hands have you seen him donk bet? If he's donk betting top pair/mid pair/flush draws you might as well raise to gii on the flop.    He had not shown down many hands, but i had seen him x/c flop, lead turn, and bet river a lot, usually getting a fold. One hand I had seen him limp/call pre with, then donk flop (9c8c8d), b turn (Kd), jam river (kh) with was TT. Other than that I haven't seen much."

Eeeeeeh that makes me less likely to like my hand here.  If he's taking the top of his range pre and flat/calling it instead of opening or raising at any point, that gives him a lot more hands that beat us both at the top of his range (99+) and the bottom (87s).  Maybe a better line would be to put in a small raise otf and fold to further aggression?  But then again when you see the turn it's not like you could fold."

poker,3cyane,kaellinn18,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like a standard Shove on the flop to me. There is what...14k ish in the pot already at that point (5200+6000+blinds) And it isn't very likely he is ahead of you here. With a 10% pfr he is very likely raising his overpairs to the board and is likely to slowplay a set, and donkbet on the bubble doesn't exactly scream strength. The 14k itself is worth more than enough to shove without even thinking about needing to make any more from it, and is even more important with the need to protect your hand from any overpair/heart. I don't think bubble ICM is as big of a deal as trying to gain chips from what appears to be a hugely plus EV posiiton considering the mincash will only be <2x the buyin."

You want to make villain pay to draw out on you. This being said, I also shove on that turn. If you're beat by a K, you have outs with spades and probably an ace or 8 as well.  Whoops, completely misread your opening statement the first time through. Your play seems fine to this point I think. I would probably shove here myself.

BU will xb this board too much, if they don't our x/r in our seat looks to strong to get value from their range OTF (KK easy fold, blocks KJ - depends on our image and how well we rep KJ/J9 though). The other player have tonnes of hands that will call one bet OTF. Board runouts can be very tough on this board if it gets xd thru, betting will make ranging for us much easier.  As played, hand has to play read based. Are you able to raise and VB river huge and get paid by QJ? Will V1 3b with a straight draw or set? Will V2 back raise? Is either V1/V2 capable of c/r river with a straight or set for either of our lines, or do they auto-check river if we raised turn? Can we get away with raise turn and VB river 1/3p-1/2p and only get c/r by better, or will we induce bluffs? Will raise turn VB river 1/3p induce terrible calls?  If we know nothing about them, I'm calling turn. Mostly calling river if V1 bets and V2 folds. Deciding based off bet size if both call. Calling if V1 checks and V2 bets reasonable. Again depending on reads might value raise in the right situation and bet size, but totally read based."

poker,3cy3sn,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:46:27 2015 UTC,This is true and what I can't wrap my head around is why the same isn't true in NL. It should be even more true in NL because fewer players see the flop.
poker,3cy3sn,18andover,2,Sat Jul 11 23:13:50 2015 UTC,"Seems to me RIO is bigger in LHE because minimal value can be extracted on turned 2 pairs, add opposed to NL where you can easily put people in a ""playing for stacks"" predicament without odds. In limit, you hit two pair, you're likely getting one bet of pure value, and when a better two pair are made, you have to pretty much be willing to at least pay off an extra bet. You likely lose two betting then calling a good portion of the time. So the RIO combined with the minimal turn extraction leaves a very small gap compared to NL. That's my theory."
poker,3cy3sn,FootofGod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance.   What's RIO? Did you mean ROI?
poker,3cy3sn,niggysmallz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"Nope! ROI is Return On Investment, usually used for quantifying tourney results. RIO is Reverse Implied Odds.

poker,3cy3sn,PatrickBlom,2,Sat Jul 11 22:10:30 2015 UTC,But river decisions matter way more than any other decision in NL and are relatively unimportant in limit.

poker,3cy3sn,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert,  but. ..In limit HE, you can and should be a lot more aggressive as there is a much smaller penalty for being overly aggressive.  Hands which are usually flat called pf in NLHE can be 3 bet to try to force heads up pots.  You can also bet much thinner for value or cap a multi way pot for value on the flop with a good draw without fear of being bet off your hand.   Also, the odds you are getting to call down are amazing, so you should never make the mistake of folding too often even if you think you are likely beat.  In NLHE it could be better in certain situations to slow play a big hand to get more of your opponent's money.   In limit, you should rarely slow play as players are calling down anyway and you can't afford to miss bets.   Surprisingly,  variance is often much higher in limit as you can't do much to control the pot or odds others are getting to draw, so you are often at the mercy of the cards.   Over the long run, though, if you are playing a good range of hands from each position and extracting max value post flop, you should show a nice win rate."

It's not as dead as it looks, I delete my old threads and I started all but one of them. There are at least 4 LHE pros who subscribe and post there. Which is higher than the number of NL pros who are regs in /r/poker and a ratio that approaches infinity better.   strategy adjustments   -Ax type hands go up in value, speculative hands (small pairs, suited connectors) go down in value. It's about immediate odds not implied odds.  -PF you should never limp or flat other than under specific scenarios/game conditions. You should almost always either raise or fold.   -Always Be Value Betting. You can and should be making razor thin value bets in LHE. I'm certain a lot of my edge comes from getting those extra bets in, while my opponents do not charge me. You got AK on the turn and the board is 9722 and a loose passive has been calling all the way, value bet that shit. You got 44 and the board is JJ752 and some guy who always thinks you're bluffing is calling you down, value bet that shit.   -Always Be Calling. The reason the above is true is because it is often correct to make very light calls in limit, given the pot odds. A and K hi calls are standard in a lot of spots. You can't do it blindly though, you have to learn how to:  -Hand read like a boss: it is essential to become an expert hand reader. There is no silver bullet to get good at this quickly, it just takes practice and effort. You need to be able to put people on accurate ranges PF, narrow it down based on their post flop actions and then figure out whether you have odds to call their late street bets based on the range you've given them.   -NL is usually about being right this hand. The extreme example is folding KK PF. You have to know he has AA. Limit is about being right often enough to make your action profitable. Whether it is a river A hi value bet or a call with 22 on a board of A9J53. You will often be wrong and when you're new you will feel like this means you made a mistake, that's what NL teaches us. You didn't necessarily make a mistake. That just has to work often enough to make it profitable. If the pot is laying you 15:1 and the play works 1:12 times, you just made money -- but you'll still be wrong over 90% of the time!   There are many more. I'm sure there have been some great 2+2 threads on this if you do a search."

When table #7 or 8 opens, I'm unable to press any of the buttons for a bit - the game still plays on in the background until it eventually catches up with itself and I'm able to click ""I'm back"".  It also makes Pokerstars client very slow at tiling the tables and even moving them around/resizing them, although this is negated somewhat by going into task manager and increasing it's priority to high - but it's still slower than when Jivaro isn't running.  Pokerstars has crashed a couple of times recently while I was running Jivaro, but not often enough for me to make a solid connection. It hasn't crashed since I stopped using Jivaro.  Thinking about it, I have had a few times recently where Jivaro itself has sort of crashed - the hud disappears, I get logged out and it doesn't remember my login details, so I have to enter them again."

I'd bet smallish ($200) on turn and allow him to possibly even spaz out with KhQ type hands.  On the river, it's really close between calling and shoving. With both ace and queen of heart out, neither of your ranges include that many flushes. I slightly prefer shoving the river over his bet."
poker,3cw7qx,CyrusII,3,Sat Jul 11 10:19:47 2015 UTC,"So you bet turn small and call a jam? That seems kinda gross dude. I think checking is fine as well, as it's a l/c w=range we're up against, and I can't see many broadway hearts in it."
poker,3cw7qx,SkeetRag,2,Sat Jul 11 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, call the jam on turn very happily. We start the hand 40 bb deep against a random 5/10 player and only two people saw the flop. Ace and queen of hearts are on the flop. Not that many monsters under the bed."

poker,3cw7qx,CyrusII,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:05:43 2015 UTC,please list the hands villain (a reasonable reg given no reads) will bet call the river with that take this line which top set beats? I think a reg would be folding QQ to a river shove because hero is v unlikely to be doing this with A9.
poker,3cw7qx,9betfold,0,Sat Jul 11 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Here is one: AJ. As I said multiple times, from villians point of view there are not many flushes in hero's range and given the fact that many people only shove flush or air here, calling with AJ is prob even profitable."
poker,3cw7qx,CyrusII,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"given that logic - flush or air are our only river shoves and we have v few flushes, villain should call with basically any pair. So in turn we should jam TPTK+, which is obviously insane."
poker,3cw7qx,9betfold,3,Sat Jul 11 23:18:33 2015 UTC,Can someone explain why checking the turn is good? I'm curious as to the reasoning here.
poker,3cw7qx,shanghaidry,3,Sat Jul 11 16:25:44 2015 UTC,we block hands we're getting three streets from and the flush draw completes

poker,3cw7qx,shanghaidry,3,Sat Jul 11 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"Why is that relevant? Having the best hand the majority of the time isn't a reason to bet. The only thing we're really missing value from by checking the turn is 22. Hands that pick up a heart draw on the turn are likely calling river if it bricks anyway, but not calling turn and river."

poker,3cw7qx,Rimmoruud,4,Sat Jul 11 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"Think it seems ok. Pretty sure I like checking back turn since we block top pair. Not folding river this high up in our range, guy prob value bets worse and can have bluffs"

poker,3cw7qx,BerryGuns,7,Sat Jul 11 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, there's not many hands villain can have that'd call a shove that he has beat. QQ would raise/reraise pre, as probably would AK/AQ (although you have blockers) so we can throw those out, even though they are slightly possible. 2s are a possibility, maybe 9s or 5s with a reverse float on flop. There are a shit load more combos of flushes and bluffs in his range than hands he can call that hero beats so I don't think shoving is the best option. Plus villain isn't getting that great of odds to call with some weaker holdings.  Edit: can you PM me the results?"

I expect a lot of KhXh combos to play the flop more aggressively. Let's say he's playing all SC with hearts, Ax, Qx and sets this way. We can get value from Ax hands, AQ/A5s, 22, and deny single hearts the ability to draw. If he jams, we're going to have to call. We often have the right odds with a quads/FH draw on the river."

So I learned plo so that I could play in that game.   Anyway, I kept on playing and learning, and got to the point where I was making good money playing live once a week, and $1-2 and $2-4 standard and deep online, and shortstacking bigger online games.

Also known as the bloody stupid French Model. 2.) You'll be able to play with the larger rest of the world player , rake may slightly increase (or VIP options reduced) in order to pay local taxes. Also known as the rather well written Danish model. In either model, the chances of PokerStars not getting a licence are really slim.

poker,3cvhyw,Four_Months,6,Sat Jul 11 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"Well... at these stakes you should probably stick with the balugawhale rule, ""when a fish doth raise, though shalt lay down thy single pairs."" I learned the hard way that it works pretty well :p. Not much worse than 2p in his range when he raises the turn (33 55 AJ are most likely). And then, if you're calling the turn thinking you're still good i don't know why you're checking that river.  But its not like its possible to put him on 24o flatting an EP raise.. so don't sweat that part. 33, JJ, JA, 55, and idk if hed slowplay but AA are all likely in this spot on the turn though, so its a fold.  What helped me lay down hands like this was just thinking along the lines of ""would he actually do this with worse than I have?"" and in this spot, especially given the lack of likely draws he'd even be bluffing with, answering that makes it a lot easier to fold.  All of the above is as applied to microstakes where players are much more passive of course.  I dunno wtf he's doing on the river."
poker,3cvhyw,earth159,2,Sat Jul 11 03:18:30 2015 UTC,I checked the river looking for a c/r to get more value from weaker 2ps but.....
poker,3cvhyw,earth159,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"I misread when I typed my last response to this, so deleted - I think c/r is bad here tbh, torn between thin value bet if you really think he's lighter (low 2p's) based on history, else just check/calling (would consider folding to a shove/large size) but plenty of sets in his range he'll just get it in with and you're fucked and priced in, and given the action he can still check back a lower 2p."

(Yes I know it's not the nuts, but it's the nuts)  Edit:: Changed my mind.. I think you bet for value there."
poker,3cvhyw,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:11:30 2015 UTC,On the river when the king hit I was leaning towards a c/r between c/r and c/c because he most likely has a weaker two pair than a set or a straight. When he checked behind (split second before I saw his cards) I was slapping myself that I might have missed some value... but.......... my eye balls nearly fell out....
poker,3cvhyw,jambre,2,Sat Jul 11 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Check/raise has to be a losing play here. Realistically he should only really have AJ for two pair and he's not necessarily going to raise two pairs. He can have 33, 55 and sometimes JJ here though."
poker,3cvhyw,Jarggo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:33:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks :). I was thinking that because its the lower stakes people love to play any ace rag I thought he could well have called my c-bet with a low pair and turned a two pair with an ace. So I was thinking of c/r to get value from hands like A5 A3. I mean if he called with 42o , A5 A3 are definitely well within his range.  Is calling the raise on the turn standard even if I know I am behind most of the times?"

poker,3cv9mo,RudolfKGB,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:15 2015 UTC,Tight is right. The blind pressure will be basically non-existent so you will be able to open with a lot more premium hands because the cost per round will be almost non-existent.

poker,3cv28v,IdentifyingString,2,Sat Jul 11 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"Villain bet half pot (or raised or whatever I didn't watch the whole video).  The point is that for Torelli to make the call he needs to win 25% of the time, this is because he's getting 3:1 on a call.  What does that mean? Well let's just say villain bet $5 into a $10 pot, for simplicity. Torelli would have to call $5 to win $15 (the bet and the pot), or 3:1.  So if Torelli wins exactly 25% of the time here based on villain's range in this spot then it's a breakeven call. If he wins >25% then it's a profitable call and if it's <25% then it's a losing call, even though he might win 1/5 times."
poker,3cv28v,Clarityy,2,Sat Jul 11 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, so it has less to do with the cards and more to do with betting X amount in order to win a substantially larger Y amount."
poker,3cv28v,Clarityy,2,Sat Jul 11 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are talking about pot odds. In your comment you are talking about the odds to hit a draw, they are different things.  In poker we can't really narrow anyone down to a single hand that we either beat or lose to, this is impossible against most players. So what we do is we give them a range.  Villain raised preflop so he doesn't have 72o, villain bet AKT flop so he doesn't have KQ, stuff like that. For this river spot we attempt to narrow villain's range as much as we can, until we know what hands villain could reasonably have in this spot. Then we look at how many combinations we beat, and how many beat us, we can turn that into a winning%.  Then we look at the bet. If villain bets half pot then to make a good call we have to be winning >25%. If he bets pot we have to win >33%, if he bets 2x pot then we have to win >40% and so on."
poker,3cv28v,dispelthemyth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:51:52 2015 UTC,You merge both together.  Say you are getting 3:1 on a call (25%) you need to win greater than 25% (e.g. 2:1 for 33%) of the time to make it profitable so you have to work out how often your hand will win based on your hand and what you think the villains likely range of hands is.

poker,3cud8z,Great-Band-Name,3,Fri Jul 10 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"It is like this:  If you play rock paper scissors and someone always throws paper, you always throw scissors. And if they always throw scissors then you always throw rock.  There is no paradox, you want to be adjusting such that you can exploit whatever your opponent is doing.   eg. $10NL 6-max. Villain A steals 100% on the button. We counter this by 3-betting lots from the blinds. Villain B steals 20% on the button. We counter this by 3-betting and calling very little from the blinds."
poker,3cud8z,myimportantthoughts,3,Fri Jul 10 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"On a serious note. I think OP is saying ""If tight is correct vs loose, how come loose is correct vs tight?"" Which kinda makes sense cause yeah how is one favored if they counter eachother.  To answer, when we mean loose or tight we're talking about deviations from ""good poker"". So if someone has vpip/pfr of 5, they are folding too much so to exploit that we raise any two cards against people like this and we make a profit.  Against someone who is playing 30% of hands we play tight so that we have a range advantage and we can get lots of value postflop.  HOWEVER if someone is playing 100% of hands then our response shouldn't be to play tight, we can play a pretty wide range to exploit this, as long as we have a range advantage.  Poker isn't simple. The general advice of ""play tight on a loose table and play loose on a tight table"" is GENERALLY correct but there are tons of exceptions."

poker,3ct6hk,_Hnnng_,3,Fri Jul 10 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Online (real-money) is an excellent way to get a lot of volume (and experience).  It's also much more difficult at equivalent stakes level, which will help your development.  Depending on the site you play on, profitability at, say, $0.10/0.25 (25NL) translates to likely profitability at $1/2NL live.  If you can be profitable at $1/2 online ($200NL) you will crush $1/2 live games."
poker,3ct6hk,DingDingDao,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for you advice. So do you recommend I start out at $1/2 cash games or play in tournaments? If tournaments, which ones?"
poker,3ct6hk,DingDingDao,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Umm...I mean, it really kind of depends on a few factors (in my opinion).   What's your bankroll like?  Generally speaking, for online NL cash games, the general consensus is that 20 buy-ins is enough to combat variance, so for $1/2NL if you have $4K (20 x $200), then by all means go for it.  If not, I'd probably step down to 100NL, 50NL or 25NL (whatever your online bankroll will be) and run it up. How much experience do you have and how recently have you been seriously playing?  If it's been more than a couple years, I'd strongly consider starting at lower stakes levels.  The game has evolved (and continues to evolve), and strategies that might have been profitable for you even 5 years ago will not be nearly as effective nowadays.  The general player population is much more skilled these days (although there's still plenty of fish out there).  Starting at 25NL isn't a terrible idea and will give a reasonable approximation to the skill of players you'd encounter at a live $1/2NL game.  At 200NL your opponents will be much, much tougher to play against. Understanding your true profitability takes time - it's really difficult to gauge a true winrate at live games, simply because the volume you get is so low.  You'll hear a lot of numbers thrown around, but the number I generally hear is that if you are profitable at a stakes level after 100K hands, you can be pretty certain you're a winning player (at that level).  That's not to say you HAVE to get that many hands in, it's just a number that people say will give real statistical significance outside of just random variance (noise).   That's a lot of words I just wrote.  Basically, if you've got a lot of money, then take a stab at 200NL and see how you do (but expect to lose).  If your bankroll is less, the generally approved method is to start at something much lower and work your way up, learning and building your bankroll at the same time.  Regarding tournaments, I have no idea.  I play tourneys on the side just for shits and giggles, but I'm primarily a cash game player."
poker,3ct6hk,DingDingDao,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for very informative response. So if my starting bankroll is $100-200, then I should focus on 25NL and 50NL for awhile until I build up my bankroll?   Outside from last weekend, I haven't played in nearly 5 years, so I'm starting strategies from scratch but I understand the fundamentals and certain odds."
poker,3ct6hk,flipperstf,2,Fri Jul 10 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"So, with your bankroll and the amount of time you've been away from the game, I would do this (keep in mind this is just me, some random dude on the internet):   Assuming you deposit $200, that's 20 buy-ins at 10NL ($0.05/0.10).  That's where I'd start playing.  You could try 25NL, but 50NL is really just too large for your roll (only 4 buy-ins), and it's well within variance to cooler off 4 buy-ins running KK into AA or AA into underset, etc etc.  If you can run your bankroll up to $500 you'll be properly rolled for 25NL, then up to $1000 for 50NL, $2000 for 100NL, and $4000 for 200NL.  Each stakes level is incrementally tougher to beat, with regs at each level employing more strategy and adaptation/exploitation, so it's important to get volume at each stake level in order to work more advanced strategy into your game.  It doesn't have to be 100K hands--if you're crushing at 10NL, just move up and see how it goes. Study will be critical to improving your game.  Review your hand histories (you can download them and import them into an analysis tool like Hold'em Manager 2 or Poker Tracker 4) and use study tools like books (Easy Game Vols I and II by Andrew Seidman are good and available for free online in PDF) or study sites like runitonce.com.  There are also numerous pros making videos on Youtube (Jason Somerville and Gripsed come to mind).   Feel free to ask me any other questions--I took a few years off having a kid, and I was primarily a live game player before I transitioned to online poker, so I'm familiar with the territory you're in.  Good luck!"

poker,3ct6hk,evilwall,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:58 2015 UTC,Please just start at the lowest stakes and make sure you're beating that regardless of how much money you're depositing. Just move up once you're relatively sure you're a winner at that stake level.
poker,3ct6hk,DingDingDao,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:23:42 2015 UTC,"Generally for bankroll management people will recommend 20-40 buy-ins for a particular level of cash games. This is so you will be able to withstand any downswings that you may find yourself in (even playing optimally you will have losing sessions). That is, of course, assuming you are not looking to have to deposit multiple times to rebuild a roll if it gets busted."

poker,3ct6hk,Four_Months,3,Fri Jul 10 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised at how much even a little bit of money changes the way people play.  Sure, there are plenty of fish donking off money at microstakes, but it's important to build a solid foundation (preflop strategy, betsizing, hand ranging, etc).  You don't want to be trying to develop those basic tools with 25% of your roll at stake at any given time."
poker,3ct6hk,kTmike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm in the exact same position as you. Just coming back to the game after years being away after Black Friday. I deposited $250 on Bovada a few days ago, and /u/evilwall is right; you will want to start at 10NL. While there are fish at every level, this isn't like play money where people donk off their whole stack with nothing but a runner runner draw. As /u/DingDingDao pointed out, even a little bit of money makes a big difference in how people play. Bankroll management is key. I would argue that it's almost more important at micro stakes because the values seem so trivial, which means they can add up really fast without you noticing."

poker,3ct6hk,GanoDotCom,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"Bovada is the biggest site in the US. Best traffic in the US. Good cash and tourneys. Pretty soft. Downsides are there is a big fee to deposit 5% or something like that. It is all annonymous. No user names. So you can't make notes on people. Other option (which is what I use) is Americas Card Room. No fee to deposit. Lower traffic so the tourneys are smaller, but cash is filled up to 100 NL every night and even higher some nights and on weekends. Has Spin and Go games (Youtube it if you don't know what it is) kinda fun. Those are the two main options I would focus on unless your a bitcoin guy."

If I raise from LP and the blinds 3b I'll flat a much wider range as long as I'm IP or in a multi-way pot  This is just against unknowns.

poker,3currf,myimportantthoughts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you think UTG has.   If UTG is a mega nit then I think calling is best because you don't want to get in 100B preflop vs a nitty UTG 5x range of say QQ+. Because when you squeeze it is going to go in. The other guys are irrelevant, calling oop 4 handed > stacking off vs QQ+.   If UTG is wild and aggro then I like your raise.  This is a spot where you should decide before you 3-bet what the plan is. I am not entirely sure what you wanted to happen when you 3b.  You should try not to be in a spot where you 3b, get shoved on and then not know what do to IMO. You should already know when UTG ships what the plan is.  EDIT: also, with any hand you want to be thinking: 'how do I make money here'. When you 3bet here, you either make money by A) everyone folding and you picking up the pot, B) people calling with worse hands than yours, or C) people shoving with worse hands than yours. If you don't think any of these are very likely to happen, you should just call."

poker,3ctwlb,lixoxite,2,Fri Jul 10 19:10:48 2015 UTC,Poker is not know for being linear. The first day you might get really bad cards and surviving would be a success for you. The second day you might get really good cards and situations and having the most chips would be considered successful. That is not to say you shouldn't consider your chip stack since your stack size will help decide what is the best play to take. But if you have tripled up and been successful on one of the days but still see a situation that is profitable you should take it. In this type of tournament your going to have to play really well and get really lucky. No reason to avoid a good situation just because you met your quota for the day.
poker,3ctwlb,ACRUNNER,2,Fri Jul 10 21:12:59 2015 UTC,"You can't have a set goal for each day other than playing the best poker you can by making the right decisions at the time.   As for what to do if you are a chip leader near the end of the day, thats up to you. If you have KK on the last hand and a guy with 2/3 of your stack goes all in, what should you do? If he has been pretty loose maybe its worth the call, if he has been tight and only showing strong starting hands perhaps sit this one out.   There are so many variables to poker, trying to pinpoint exact milestones is pointless. Just play good poker and you will be fine."
poker,3ctwlb,karasz816,2,Fri Jul 10 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure exactly what you're looking for but general tips are- play super tight (obviously) near the beginning and just observe how the players around you are playing. Try not to get your whole stack in while you are very deep unless you are SURE you have the best hand.  Once the antes are in play, it will become more optimal to open up a bit more, depending (of course) on the players at your table and near you. But generally, once antes are in play stealing/restealing will be much more profitable plays.  Otherwise, as others say, just play your stack as best as possible with the cards and spots you get and you should be fine :)"
poker,3ctwlb,earth159,4,Sat Jul 11 03:03:43 2015 UTC,"Setting a stack size-based strat in a normal freezeout isn't going to be worthwhile because it'll cause you to make -ev plays to either get to a certain arbitrary amount or maintain a certain arbitrary amount.  Just play tight and aggressive and pay attention and exploit the players at your table.  The only bb levels you should be concerned with are 20-25bb (time to start looking to 3b shove), 10-12bb (time to start open shoving) and when you have all of the bbs."

Villain at this point will have $37 left in their stack, and would have already committed $27, or about 42% of their original stack.  Once you think a few seconds (gotta hollywood a little) and shove your stack on the river, villain will need to call off their remaining $37 in order to win a pot of $94, so villain will be given pot odds of 2.54-1, meaning they will need at least 28% equity to break even.  Assuming they flush, this should be a strong enough hand to make the call.  edit - /u/verneer are you the crushing micros guy? if so good stuff!"

poker,3csksm,withoutatrace123,0,Fri Jul 10 19:36:39 2015 UTC,Usually in a spot like this I bet 10$ on turn and shove river but that may be bad.
poker,3csksm,flipperstf,3,Fri Jul 10 13:05:27 2015 UTC,"That does seem pretty bad to me. Betting $10 means there will be $45 in the pot and $43 behind, not totally unreasonable but still a large bet.  Betting even $15 means there will be $55 in the pot with only $38 behind, much more easy for villain to talk himself into and I can't imagine many hands folding to $15 into $25 if they were going to call $10."
poker,3csksm,iamcrazyjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but a 10$ bet gets calls from a lot of hands that may fold to a bigger bet, depending on the player of course."

poker,3csksm,iamcrazyjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:37:50 2015 UTC,Agreed....$10 is too low...leaves too much value behind and lets the villian get away from it esp if the river comes down with a potentially ruinous hand for him (4th spade if he's going for a straight draw or straight card if playing for the flush).  In this spot I would be looking to bet enough on the turn to get him pot committed on the river.
poker,3csksm,cobwebscavern,4,Fri Jul 10 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'd bet more than that for 2 reason, 1) set up a better SPR for jamming, and 2) if he's floating with overcards/overpair/tptk, he might not call on a lot of rivers, so we need to get value now from the hands that can't call on river."
poker,3csksm,SkeetRag,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"5 of spades is an awesome card for you. Flush just got there (plus 4 card flush draw), it's not a scare card (discounting the flush, straight opportunities remain the same) if V is holding a decent PP or has something like 76s. Betting to bloat the pot is great especially as it leaves V pot committed if he calls a decent sized bet."

poker,3cun7u,theFinalBoss,2,Fri Jul 10 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"Could I remove some cards from his range based on the fact that he is betting into me out of position?   Yes, but it depends on villain. Do you think he'd bet AK, AJ or JJ here? (btw if he's 3betting AJ he's probably 3betting 99).  I think either way this spot is a very easy call. As you can tell by the way you've ranged him villain hits this flop super hard, which means we have massive implied odds. A king is also good for us some of the time.  It's hard to break down a spot in a very detailed fashion, but if you want to give a try use CardrunnersEV software and plug in all the possibilities and play around with them. In general you will have to know the answer by certain spots because you've looked at them off the table, or you use your intuition.  In this case I think folding would be really bad, raising would be kinda bad, and calling would be good. However I can't really mathematically prove this without spending way more time than I want to on this relatively simple spot.  I will say that if you think his 3betting range looks the way you've shown, we can fold preflop."
poker,3cun7u,Clarityy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I find it hard to make a decision based on the above. I am confused as ace is in his range a lot which is a blocker for our straight draw and pairing our Jack is usually not good ( beaten by AK, AQ,AJ, AA,KK,QQ,TT). Based on an EV calculator(including the 99 you mentioned for their range):  Pre-flop we have 70-30 (2.33) and to call the reraise we are getting 22 -9 (2.44) pot odds. Would effective and implied odds kind of cancel each other out?  Post-flop we are 68-32 (2.125), so we have marginally improved. However now our pot odds based on the c-bet are 51/20 (2.55) and that isn't effective pot odds as it is likely villain is betting again since they end up ahead. I guess we call here as you said.  My main concern is, how does everyone calculate these things so quickly? or is it more of saying something like: ""OK, this hits his range, I'm only worried about flushes really. My straight and sometimes King are good, I'll proceed and assess after the turn."" Or maybe players like you with experience know that with an open ender on the flop and a tight player you are ahead based on implied odds. Based on the math, it looks much, much closer."
poker,3cun7u,najtcewm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"It costs you 20 to win 51 so you need to win 20/71 or 28% of the time to break even on the call. Against his range in position, you are normally thinking about call or fold. You don't have much. A straight draw that doesn't want to see a spade plus draws to 2nd pair and to an overpair that might give him a straight. Effective odds, you have 6 good outs or 12% on the turn. You can't calculate for two cards because you have another card to face, unless you want to shove on the flop. Then you would have 24%. If you shove 185 to win 51, then you need to win 185/236 of the time. With implied odds, if you call the 20, there is 71 in the pot and V has 165 left. If you hit your card 12% of the time, or about 1 in 8.5 times, you would like the chance to win a pot that is 8.5 times bigger than it is now. I think that means his stack would need to be 8.5 X 71, maybe it's 8.5 X 51, but his remaining stack is only 165."

Pre seems fine, we can't 4b JJ for value at 2NL 9-handed. Flop is a peel and reevaluate if Villain c-bets like 100% of his range, but he probably doesn't, so folding flop (as nitty as it is) is probably okay"

poker,3ctsj5,duskhat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"Sure. Maybe I'm wrong about all of the following, and if I am I'm eager to hear why :)  This depends on the villain, right? Are we confident that this one in particular is going to pay us half his stack if we hit a set?  If we think villain's range is AK/QQ+, and the flop comes J high -- what course of action can we take postflop where set mining becomes profitable?  Say it's an otherwise dry board e.g. Js4d2c -- he can find a fold if we check/raise his cbet. Say we just call -- what's our range from his perspective? Jx/44/22? What do we do when the turn bricks in this case -- lead out and basically announce our set, or check and hope he doesn't check back?  This villain's sample size isn't large, but against nits I'm not sure I like set mining with jacks. It's just hard to imagine getting stacks in without being in danger yourself. If his range were wider, like if we add low pocket pairs to it, then sure."

I understand that you have the best hand a large % of the time, but it's going to be very hard to get good value.  VS friendly players I've noticed the Ace is the card they not only love to play (meaning if he puts any money in on an A hi board he literally has every combo of Ax and you aren't beating the large majority of them) and also the card if it's on the board they are most likely to actually fold (i.e. he won't pay you off with worse very often)."

More confidence does not make you a better player if anything it makes you worse because it makes people believe they made the right play and the lesser player made the wrong player and variance is just killing me. You then suggest that by moving you are then able to be more aggressive with your bankroll and take shots at higher stakes. Now i understand that for some this will work out great but for plenty this will actually turn out worse, Having worked in the gambling industry for the last 10 years i have seen way too many people up their stakes and start off winning and after a while they believe that this is my new stake I'm good enough to be at this level but due to bad play/variance they go on a downswing and should move back down in stakes but they figure I'm too good to be playing these horrible players in the micros so don't move down and end up bust. When it comes to reloading they still blame going bust on variance and start with 5-10BI for ""the stake I should be playing"" go busto again repeat the steps a few times without ever thinking it was their fault. I understand this was never you intention and that you are actually doing good for the players that watch your videos but maybe save the bankroll advice for players that pay for your coaching and you can see from there play that they are a little better at tilt control than the average player stuck in the micros.   as I said hopefully you don't take too much offence to this as I watch the videos even though I don't play cash games.

poker,3csv0o,kTmike,14,Fri Jul 10 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"First off, the hand was from Rounders.   Secondly, You're comparing AI-EV, which is a subset of all things variable, to the encompassing term.  On the flop, if I have a nut flush draw, and Villain has bottom pair, and we re-create that scenario 100 times, I should get there more than 10 times. Just because we're not all in doesn't make it mathematically unlikely/irregular for the trend to not of made the flush the appropriate amount of times. This is something that AI-EV obviously cannot account for. Or flopping middle set vs top set and getting stacked on 9JQds, we made a solid play, was unfortunate to run into the top of his range, this is variance, as all the hands he could of stacked off we found the highest.   There's no way to track that type of stuff, but as long as you run the math and ranges and see that it was a solid play, it doesn't really matter the outcome.   **Edited to add, because I didn't reply to your thread really, what do you mean 'for variance to kick in'? Variance is a statistical term that can get pretty math-y (lots of integrals/ Reimman sums and shit), but basically it's a term used to see the mean difference between a bunch of points. Of every decision you make in poker, imagine it like when you're running a sim in equilab. You play out the scenario 1000000 times, of having 67 on 678r, sometimes there are shitty turn cards, sometimes bricks, sometimes dude binks a set, sometimes he gets it in with overcards, sometimes he has a straight, these are all potential outcomes, modeled by likelyhood."

If you take one hand into account your variance will be insane, but it's still there.   From wiki: ""variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out"". If you play one hand and you are 70% favourite, but still lose what is your variance? You should win 70% of the time, you won 0%. If we take your example of 100 hands sample, you should win 70%, you won 60%. It's way more accurate in the second case, but the first one is still variance.   Sorry you lost your blowjob bet."

You will probably win almost exactly half a million times, lose half a million times and wind up ahead $0 with very little variance.  If you flip a coin once, you are either going to be down 1 unit or up 1 unit instead of the expected 0 units.  That is variance."

poker,3csv0o,eddiemon,4,Fri Jul 10 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"You're basically arguing over semantics, but your gf is still more correct. We describe the outcome of each poker hand as an (mostly) independent random variable with a certain probability distribution, that may or may not change over time. Even when you only draw once from the distribution, the variance is already defined by the probability distribution.  When people say ""variance"" in poker, they are actually describing one of two different things: One is variance of the sum, the other is variance of the mean. As you play more hands, the variance of the sum gets larger, but the variance of the mean gets smaller. Example of the first kind of variance is when good players experience huge downswings when their play hasn't changed (not tilting or playing poorly). The second kind of variance is the good kind. The fact that the variance of the mean gets smaller as you play more, means that if you're a break-even/winning player, you don't need to worry about small hand-to-hand fluctuations. Instead you can focus on whether your play is +EV or not, as the average outcome of a larger number of +EV plays will be +EV by overwhelming odds."
poker,3csv0o,Willowysp,3,Fri Jul 10 16:30:33 2015 UTC,This makes a lot of sense. He was talking about variance of the sum and I was talking about variance of the mean. Thanks for explaining that!
poker,3csv0o,eddiemon,3,Fri Jul 10 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"Glad to help. Also you guys need to watch Rounders like right now. As bad as the poker is, it's a great movie."
poker,3csv0o,Stixx_27,3,Fri Jul 10 17:05:04 2015 UTC,That hand in question is from this scene in the movie Rounders Siding with your GF on this one.
poker,3csv0o,okayifimust,3,Fri Jul 10 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"What happened to him does not constitute variance. For variance to kick in you need to play multiple sessions. Where your expected out come is not met.   Your expected outcome is 70% - wether that is over 1 hand or a million hands doesn't mkae a difference.   For example I get AK in against AQ 100 times in a row. I'm supposed to win about 70% of time time and lose 30% of the time. But during the 100 times we run it I only win 60 times and lose 40 times. The difference between the EV and the return is what produces the variance.   You're never ""supposed"" to win or lose.   But you cannot call something variance when you only have 1 session because the variance will be so high.    You do realize you are npot making any sense any more, right?  If oyu can't call somethng vaqriance, then that variance wouldn't be high, or low - it wouldn't be there.  Also: Sessions? Please don't ....  If variance doesn't exist in a single hand, then accumulating multiple hands will not make it magically appear."
poker,3csv0o,IPlayEveryGame,2,Fri Jul 10 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"Your girlfriend is correct. Variance is a specific term from probability theory and is not limited to Poker usage. Undoubtedly you can just google the equation for calculating the variance in a discrete finite sample, and in it you will find a variable that describes the sample size (typically n). And as you will see, it can be computed for n=1 just fine (not for n < 1 tho)."
poker,3csv0o,gigahertzish,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:59 2015 UTC,"As a statistical term, the variance of a set of values is how far apart the values can reasonably be expected to get from the expected average. If you see each hand as a value in this set, poker has a high variance, because if I win 2 big blinds every 100 hands, my average rate is .02 Big Blinds per Hand, but in any given hand, I might win or lose 20+ Big blinds. The fact that bad beats exist is variance, but the bad beats themselves are, semantically speaking, a result of variance. However, it is still correct to say ""I lost because of a bad beat,"" or ""I lost because of variance,"" because the full correct phrase is ""I lost because of a bad beat because of variance.""  Most players use variance to refer to good players losing even though they played well, which is again, a result of variance, but not variance itself.  TL;DR: If you're going to get that technical, you're both wrong, and if you're not going to get that technical, then why are you arguing?  Also, she is closer to being right than you are, but only slightly."
poker,3csv0o,In_Other_Words,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"The assumption is that each player can expect a specific win rate (often measured in BB/100 hands) based on their skill level relative to the field they are playing. However, this is a theoretical expectation and actual results will usually not be exactly that amount. This is variance. It does not matter if you play 1 hand or 10,000 hands, the difference between the expected win rate and actual win rate is variance."

poker,3csv0o,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:08:56 2015 UTC,"Variance:       In probability theory and statistics, variance measures how far a set of numbers is spread out. A variance of zero indicates that all the values are identical. Variance is always non-negative: a small variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (expected value) and hence to each other, while a high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean and from each other.  An equivalent measure is the square root of the variance, called the standard deviation. The standard deviation has the same dimension as the data, and hence is comparable to deviations from the mean.  The variance is one of several descriptors of a probability distribution. In particular, the variance is one of the moments of a distribution. In that context, it forms part of a systematic approach to distinguishing between probability distributions. While other such approaches have been developed, those based on moments are advantageous in terms of mathematical and computational simplicity.

poker,3csumz,joesun1015,11,Fri Jul 10 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"Preflop  Player 2, AJs, Preflop, raise:  Player 2's preflop raise with AJs is standard from early position-- though AJs is near the bottom of the range you should be raising with in early position nine-handed.    Player 8, AQs, Preflop, 3-bet:  Player 8's preflop 3-bet with AQs is standard from SB. AQs is probably the best hand, but you need to narrow the field, a large 3-bet would do it. Additionally, the pot's got about $0.20 in it already, so everyone folding here isn't a bad prospect.    Player 8's bet accomplishes exactly what he wants to do - get heads up with a single player with a hand he dominates.    Player 2, AJs Preflop, call:  Player 2's preflop call of the 3-bet is a little weak. The problem with AJ is that it looks so good, but what do you beat that Player 8 is 3-betting with preflop? Is Player 8 ever 3-betting KJ or AT?  There's also the stack-to-pot ratio - after the money goes in, Player 2 only has 1.25 pot sized bets behind.   Flop 934r  Player 8, AQ-high postflop, c-bet:  A lot of the hands AQ would be afraid of here got folded out preflop. If the hand had a K, J, or T in it - then there might be more cause for concern for player 8.  But if AQ was the best hand preflop, it is almost certainly the best hand postflop.  A c-bet here is pretty standard - you probably have the best hand but it's vulnerable, so you probably want to bet for value and get random hands (like KJ) to surrender their equity.    I'm not sure I like the bet sizing though - $0.55 into a pot of $0.71 - because the board is very dry. I think you could accomplish the same with a bet of $0.40.  A bet of $0.55 only gets called by better, and if you get raised, you can't really fold because of the stack sizes giving you good odds.    Player 2, AJ-high postflop with runner-runner heart draw, shove:  Player 2's shove is pure spew, especially given what he should have been able to deduce about Player 8's hand. Player 8 has shown aggression preflop and on the flop. He's playing big pots out of position which usually means a big hand. AK/AQ/AA/KK/QQ/JJ/TT.  All of those hands are beating AJ right now...   What's more, he's giving Player 8 pot odds of 0.54/2.89 or 18.6%, and if he had a pair, player 8 can't fold with anything in his range. The bottom of his range at this point is AQ - and that still has two overcards for 6 outs twice (or about 24% to pair up... not that Player 8 needs to.)   Player 8, AQ-high postflop, call:  Player 8's call is standard."

If they both call off top 30% we get one call 51% of the time and have 38% equity for example.

When the SB calls (and the BB folds) the pot will be 31160 with us investing 13780.  So the 'breakeven' point would be 9180.  Which is 29.46% equity.  Even vs a top 10% range, our hand has 31.28% equity.  Since the BB has even less chips, we'd need even less equity vs their range in order to be a breakeven play."

I played a pot with him where he flatted my raise and then we got it all in on the flop. I had AA and so did he. Even though we chopped I felt completely outplayed. I never would have put AA in his range there. I realized he was playing against my rather aggressive image, and he knew the way I thought, how I read hands.  I didn't know you could just flat aces!

poker,3cp1zs,thehan,3,Fri Jul 10 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting about Shane Warne. From the newspaper article you were quoted in, it doesn't sound like he played the predictable, weak game that you said the pros played. Maybe he always plays aggressively, or maybe he getting some massive rungood. Although he did say he had bubbled 3 times, so it's no fluke. Thanks for these great reports. Like that you seem to know what you are doing around the poker table. BTW, don't think it rings quite true that the good pros seem predictable and weak. When I have played with them, it more seems like they just don't make any mistakes. The main is a game of survival with such long slow levels that getting through the minefield and letting others blow themselves up rather than blow up you is critical. Nice call on the turn with the gunshot and overs against Ole. I don't mind the AKs play against him also because you want to keep the pot small on general principle against someone that good."

poker,3cp1zs,NihilisticToad,2,Fri Jul 10 03:03:18 2015 UTC,I like the flat pre in the first hand. That was actually a good chance to check raise pretty big after the flop imo since the other player called as well and would have been a good squeeze. As played I don't mind it either way.

poker,3cte1e,joesun1015,3,Fri Jul 10 16:55:55 2015 UTC,It's a fist pump call imo.
poker,3cte1e,NihilisticToad,3,Fri Jul 10 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"Well.. I wouldn't say ""snap"" call but its probably a pretty comfortable call of a typical re-steal range in a spot like this. Given the initial raiser has all of 2BBs and the SB only has ~10BB with 2 people to act, I'd say his range includes plenty of Ax you crush, probably some KQ,KJ and even Kx type hands you beat hard, and plenty of low pocket pairs you flip against. His range is wide enough that AK,QQ, KK, AA (The only hands you lose hard to) likely show up infrequently enough for a call. Have to take spots like this in a tournament even if they aren't perfect :/"
poker,3cte1e,earth159,3,Fri Jul 10 17:14:25 2015 UTC,Smash the mouse call.
poker,3cte1e,skinnyfatdudebro,2,Fri Jul 10 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Just ran the maths, assuming there is zero ICM  Nash is: UTG+1 cram 66%, SB recram 62%, Hero rerecrams 36% (which is any pair, any ace, K2s+ etc.)  Nash is not perfect by any means but I think calling with AQ is absolutely mandatory here, we have the best hand a very high % of the time and even if we don't we have decent equity. Plus even if we lose we have 20BB."
poker,3cte1e,myimportantthoughts,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:29 2015 UTC,"Man..I'm not going to pretend to be am expert on GTO play, but there is no way calling with A2 or K2, etc after a shove and reshove is correct."
poker,3cte1e,MathW,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Villain 1 is probably shoving pretty lightly since he has only double the amount of the pot he's got exactly the kind of hand he showed up with most of the time and, obviously, lots of better hands. Villain 2 his closer to the top of his range. Hands like AXs KQs A9o and pairs maybe as bad as K9s or QJ depending on how fishy he is. His thought might be that a shove is better than a call since he's going to be out of position and his hand doesn't flop well plus a lot of the time he gets you to fold out your equity where if he just called you could easily be getting odds on a call.  Anyway the important thing is this makes you light years ahead of his range. The only hands you really crushed by are QQ+ and AK. This is a call in most situations. Even if you lost you would still have a decent stack."
poker,3cte1e,donkeyotee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"Looking at the stack sizes, I'd be comfortable with a call.  Consider, the SB was probably looking for any playable hand, the all-in was just to discourage you from calling, don't think you can say anything regarding their hand strength, since the stacks are so low but his range is probably pretty wide.  Given the blinds/stack sizes if SB's going to play a hand, he might as well get it in all pre flop."

Therefore I switched it to player, but I missed that banker and made the whole thing confusing.   Bet player, keep on player haha."

poker,3con0h,Mr_Wilson26,105,Thu Jul 9 15:12:13 2015 UTC,There's a guy at the casino by me that has a toy dump truck. One of those that you pull back and then the truck moves forward. After he wins a pot he puts one chip on the back of the truck and pulls it backward so it will drive to to the dealer for their tip.

With a huge grin on his face he sent that $1 to the dealer, and the dealer turned the truck around and sent it back. Pretty funny stuff."

poker,3con0h,ImKingDuff,9,Thu Jul 9 16:02:02 2015 UTC,I think it'd be more tilting if he took a huge pot off me and then sent the truck with the $1 chip my way. Either way I'm probably still gonna laugh pretty hard. Takes a lot to tilt me.

poker,3cqyas,krownroyal83,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"Glad you called. I would have called as well since we have the best hand so much here. The way the hand went down there are only so many hands he could have. K6, K3 or air. Slim chance he played the hand super weird and has you beat but if that's the case he played his hand poorly"
poker,3cqyas,SkeetRag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:01:35 2015 UTC,"Seeing as ranges are fairly wide bb v bu, I think we call here. We can discredit AK, as that should be betting turn when you call flop on such an uncoordinated texture, only a fd. Sets are betting turn as well, perhaps he has K7/K3/K6/A3/A6. With that said, def can't discredit KK here, but to call out that combo and fold is absurd, we're so far up in our range. Meh call"
poker,3cqyas,withoutatrace123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely felt too weak to fold, should he be raising with kings up here though? I thought that would be too thin since I don't think many worse hands could call, maybe 76 and AT/AJ. Obviously if he raises expecting to get called by those it's an easy call with A7."
poker,3cqyas,rpm12345,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:25:24 2015 UTC,It looks like V took a pot control line OTT by x back and raising the river when he hit a K. There really aren't a lot of 2 pair combos except AK and I think AK bets turn most of the time. It's either AK/K6/K7/KK. BTN seems tight but is probably opening around 35-40% of his hands from BTN which makes K6s/K7s possible. We can beat enough of his value range to call down.
poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"not feeling great about it given how rare river bluffraises are at 25nl, but no way you can fold this hand for this price"
poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,-2,Fri Jul 10 08:59:09 2015 UTC,"PF,  A7o out of position call is marginally bad, your opponent is positionally aware, why not 3bet and take the blinds and dead money?      Flop:  many worse hands will call you if you donk out  Turn:  what are you checking for, do you expect to be able to check raise?   I would bet for value and protection from flush.       River:  you got owned.  it went check check on the turn so we can raise any river to make you fold one pair hands..   I would check call off his bluffs, as played call.     is this the level of play on NL25?   seems worse than NL5 even."
poker,3cqyas,Furples,3,Fri Jul 10 04:40:40 2015 UTC,We should donk flop We should donk turn This is worse than NL5

poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,3,Fri Jul 10 05:14:27 2015 UTC,I think A7o is strong enough to call and too strong to 3bet pre as a bluff. I don't think 3bet is bad if we have a decent mergey range but I can't see how flatting is bad
poker,3cqyas,withoutatrace123,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:44:29 2015 UTC,I think flatting is bad because of the very thing that happens in this example.   flop comes A and we have no idea where we are.    IMO playing out of position isn't fun or profitable in general without initiative.
poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,3,Fri Jul 10 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"So we should 3bet and then get called, flop an ace and somehow know where we are but be against a range of primarily stronger aces?"
poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,0,Fri Jul 10 05:22:34 2015 UTC,"I don't assume this positionally aware player's BU range is made up of primarily strong aces - why would you?   if anything he's going to 4bet the strong aces and big pairs, and call with mid/low pairs and sc's, gappers etc.."
poker,3cqyas,withoutatrace123,2,Fri Jul 10 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"His range isn't primarily strong aces unless I 3bet(like you suggest) and remove all his unsuited A2-A9 and leave him with AT+ or even tighter. Even so, if I 3bet and he flats with 98s and this flop comes down, he literally just folds and that's the end of that hand, no bluffing from him because my range is now ace heavy rather than if I just flat and can have things like KJ or 44 which just fold when he bluff cbets with his air. Anyway, discussing a pretty standard preflop flat wasn't the point of this thread, I wanted feedback specifically on the river which is where things deviated from standard."
poker,3cqyas,reputable_opinion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"You realize that a standard BTN range would be 22+, K6s+, K9o+, A2o+, Q8s+, QTo+, 54s+, 87o+, 75s+. It represents 35-40% of all starting hands. We are well ahead of his open BTN range.   On the other hand, he will probably continue against a 3-bet with A9o+, KTo+, QJo, 54s+, 97s+, 22+ Against this range we are not doing very well, because we've removed a lot of the aces we dominate and many of the broadway hands are coin flipping against us. We are good enough to call and not good if he calls a raise. Therefore we should call."

poker,3cnthg,iamcdr,8,Thu Jul 9 11:05:49 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to doubt that there will be recreational players. I've played on 7 different cryptopoker sites and they were all equally or more juicy than USD sites I've played on. These sites attract U.S. players, crypto investors, people who avoid traditional banking, teenagers etc. That demographic is no more interested in poker theory and improving their bb/100 than your average poker player. There is even discussion in the thread I linked to about allowing HUD and NO-HUD lobbies, so that could further attract rec players. Another advantage is that many people who invest in the asset will play more to encourage site growth and get more rakeback from their asset holdings. The crypto community is quite large and diverse now, there are major Chinese whales in these markets who may be interested in playing some medium-high stakes poker.   Besides that, a major part of my post is about the incentive that regulation or company failure could never result in your bankroll disappearing. No wire transfers, checks in the mail, withdrawal delays, government seizures, or bankruptcy. You can even move parts of your bankroll into cryptocurrency markets. I grew a bankroll from 0 with freerolls on cryptopoker sites, and so far 12% of my profits have come from trading. If I was playing on a USD site I would need to withdraw from site to bank, wire funds from bank to stock broker, trade stocks at high fees then repeat the process in the other direction. With crypto it's a matter of sending from one address to another within minutes.   There are likely to be other advantages as well. Pros wishing to avoid some taxes may find it easier with crypto sites if done properly/carefully.   There is talk of allowing lobby hosts to customize many aspects of the games, such as adding antes to cash games.   Also, some may find it appealing to have their bankroll or part of it in a more volatile currency. There's always the possibility of a long-term increase in NXT or bitcoin value. A real gambly poker player may enjoy having their bankroll rise or fall in value by 10% in a week without even playing :)"
poker,3cnthg,iamcdr,4,Thu Jul 9 11:39:19 2015 UTC,"My main reasoning here is I doubt someone who wants to just play recreationally will go through all fairly complicated (for a total noob) stuff to play some poker.

poker,3cnthg,SirHumphryDavy,3,Thu Jul 9 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"Ya that makes sense. Your average Joe who wants to have some beer and play poker after their shift at the steel plant is more likely to do some googling and use his bank card than research obscure digital currencies.  However there are lots of people in the world and the internet makes stumbling upon things pretty easy. Even on Pokershibes I used to play with a prison guard, a retired police officer, and a sports writer. They found out about dogecoin poker through google, as did I.

poker,3cnthg,hahanee,4,Thu Jul 9 12:51:41 2015 UTC,"Because the NXT platform is designed for things like this, it's a large integrated network of assets than can be built upon and accessed with one account. It would be harder to implement a decentralized exchange or poker site using bitcoin. That's also why Augur, the new decentralized prediction market, is using etherium instead of bitcoin, at least initially. I'm not sure of the technical details of it though.  Also NXT has a some great coders, one of whom (Jl777) was interested in a poker project and teamed up with an ex-pro (Valarmg) who's a SuperNET developer. So I guess that's another reason it happened with NXT before bitcoin, etherium or Bitshares."
poker,3cnthg,Innovator256,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:01:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is, by promoting this sort of thing with a much smaller cryptocurrency, you are promoting the currency itself, demand rises, price goes up. Creators make more money and with such a small market cap, it wouldn't take much to do that. Also I don't see how it would be harder to implement bitcoin than anything else but I don't know all the technical details."
poker,3cnthg,PatrickBlom,2,Thu Jul 9 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting element. If by some miracle this project became as popular as pokerstars, NXT value would rise like 100,000%.

I imagine at the very least code will be available somewhere once the project is open to players.   I second your advise, there are lots of scams in crypto and people should always do their own research before investing, betting or storing their funds with a service.

You are welcome to review the rough draft whitepaper here :  Pokereum white Paper       To the user, most of the technical jargon is an unnecessary distraction to be abstracted to what they can actually relate to ie visual proof of commitment & provable random seed unveiling, coupled with a ultimate visual experience rivaling the top industry incumbents. Also there are also proposals for using 'Stable currencies' (Ethereum based, Edollar stable currency) on top of the Ethereum Blockchain one of which Pokereum will likely utilize for player chips. Of course there are also projects in the works that would allow bitcoin or most alt coins to be utilized for chips via stable currencies as well. With Ethereum any thing that really can be decentralized will be decentralized because of its generalized blockchain and easy development interface. Basically any web developer can start building on top of ethereum today!     Pokereum DAO This is basically the Pokereum app management. The Pokereum DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization or more specifically; a voluntary, decentralized, virtual member driven organization or community, responsible for the direction and development of the Pokereum Dapp. It is a decentralized voting and proposal based organization and its members use tokens to facilitate voting and proposal activities.

poker,3cnthg,MuuaadDib,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:16:06 2015 UTC,"Mental poker:       Mental poker is the common name for a set of cryptographic problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a trusted third party. The term is also applied to the theories surrounding these problems and their possible solutions. The name stems from the card game poker which is one of the games to which this kind of problem applies. A similar problem is flipping a coin over a distance.  The problem can be described thus: ""How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?"". (Eliminating the trusted third-party avoids the problem of trying to determine whether the third party can be trusted or not, and may also reduce the resources required.)  In poker, this could translate to: ""How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?"". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, this is impossible unless the method used is such that it cannot allow any party to cheat by manipulating or inappropriately observing the electronic ""deck"".

poker,3cnthg,kajunkennyg,2,Thu Jul 9 13:44:29 2015 UTC,The problem I have with this is the volatility of crypto-currency in general. Right now there is just no way I would play on a site like this when there are such huge market fluctuations in the value of the currency I would be playing in.

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that allows arbitrary scripting on the blockchain. The Ethereum client will have an ""app store"", and users can just click on the apps to gamble, crowdfund, etc.  I think it'd be advisable to stick with heads-up games, since with decentralization there's presumably nobody running stats to detect collusion."

poker,3cnthg,ItsAConspiracy,2,Thu Jul 9 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea and project. As someone that's been around poker and the crypto scene for a while, I'd like to chime in here.   First of all, most people aren't going to switch to this for a wide number reasons. The 14 mil cap for NXT is nothing, if people are avoiding bitcoin because of the swings, they will hate NXT as it tries to go through the growing pains. Secondly, most poker players in America have just been burned way to many times. They are tired of jumping through hoops and all the scams associated with poker. There will not be a boom because of this project. Most won't play until poker is regulated where they live.   I am not saying there won't be any players, i'm sure some people will find a way to play and I expect it to be smaller then SWC, betcoin and other such projects. People just don't like the altcoins.   Have you posted about this on 2+2 and btctalk?"
poker,3cnthg,Innovator256,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:50:36 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree with you. I'm not optimistic about player pool size.

Edit: In regards to HUD that is currently being discussed in the forum, so let them know if you think that's an important factor.

poker,3cp5rr,SkeetRag,3,Fri Jul 10 03:26:15 2015 UTC,"Besides the solid asnwers already posted, I'd be wary of using TAg and LAg terms so loosely. Just because at FR player is 27/20 doesn't mean he's aggressive, it means he calls wide, and opens too many hands, but it has no indication of his aggression. If he is aggressive, flatting is sometimes best, as our hand can withhold some heat, where if we 3b he might play much more straightup."
poker,3cp5rr,Clarityy,2,Thu Jul 9 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"Opening from any position is obviously good, you can call 3bets basically always unless you're playing FR and you open utg and utg+1 3bets you, you could possibly find a fold then.  As for when someone open raises before you it will depend a lot, against MP-LP opens you can 3bet comfortable, against EP it will depend on EP (and your position) but flatting is fine.  If it goes: someone opens -> someone 3bets -> you look down at JJ then you need to figure out if the original raiser is more likely to flat or 4bet if you flat. If he 4bets a lot you can probably fold.  Post flop is a little more complicated. Maybe you can post some hands where you get to the flop with JJ and I'll take a look. If you 3bet JJ and the board comes A or K high you can generally cbet as a bluff, you can value bet low boards and you can maybe check back some Q high boards. That's my default generic anyway."

poker,3cp5rr,Sonums,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"Isolate the limper a bit bigger, 4x or 5x for pure value.  You got 3bet by btn, why are you leading this flop? Just check/call. He still has QQ+ and you're allowing him to fold his AQ+ without putting more money in (or float you and make turn really difficult), you also block a ton of the draws so you won't get value from those either.  I like the turn check, we could check/call or check/fold turn and I think they're both pretty close, but I think once villain check backs his range is mainly 9X and TX.   I actually like the river bet but that's because I think it's for value. Villain could definitely call us with JT QT KT T8s.  So I don't like your reasoning for the river bet. I think either valuebet or check/fold, villain is not value betting anything less than an ace on river and if he needed to bluff he probably would have done that on the turn.  Again, I think you played it fine.  Either you've been getting unlucky with JJ a lot for you to ask ""how do I play jacks"" or you're just not used to losing yet :P losing happens a lot in poker, even when you do everything right."
poker,3cp5rr,zatchsvape,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"That was really helpfull, thanks for your input! Like I said in the post, looking back I would not be leading on the flop there. I think you're right on every point of the hand and I really appreciate that you took the time to break down the hand for me. I actually asked the question because over 50 hands where I'm holding JJ I am a breakeven player,  which was strange to me considering it's a pretty strong holding. However, I do know that this is a small sample size and that I should have more of those hands to be able to come to a conclusion."
poker,3cp5rr,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"Seems perfectly fine to me. In that case due to the limp+iso I like calling instead of raising, we can call once on flop and fold turn, however when he minbets twice we should obviously call, so I'd say you played that hand great.  edit: only calling once because it's a multiway pot and we block QJ for the most obvious drawing hand"

Way easier to reread and absorb this:  villain is bluffy vs.   villain c-bet Kh 9s 3d, check/raise 5d, and bet 50% on 2d with 44  2) If you want to take it to the next level, use the HEM note-taking system. You can put in street by street notes.  3) Consider using a template that you keep on your clipboard (or on a hotkey) and paste it in. Like:  ---Major Reads---  ---Sizing Tells---  ---Timing Tells---  ---Important Hands---  4) If you're playing zoom or fast-fold, SIT OUT if you're going to take a note. It's easy, and you'll avoid mis-clicking or timing out.  5) Use a color label system to complement your textual notes.  And definitely make sure to add to your notes while you do your session reviews. Your doing those right?"

Folding AQo UTG is definitely on the nitty side, but no one can exploit it at lower level stakes. I would open-raise and fold to 3-bet unless the table is unusually aggressive.   In a 6-MAX game you should always open AQ in any position. I would usually call a 3-bet unless the 3-bettor is a super-nit with 11/9/3 VPIP/PFR/3b stats."

Purple tags are recreational players, largely assumed to be too loose and passive, but in general just make poorer decisions than a regular. I use it as an all encompassing tag, so mobile/tablets, short stackers, big discrepancies in vpip/prf, unusual bet sizing (pot/2bb, cb less than 50%, betting pot post flop, 3b small/too large etc).   While on the surface it seems so cut and dry, too clinical in nature to brandish a player something like that, it's more of a reference to marginal spots really to push them either direction."

Off the 26 all-ins in a 5 hour time period I won 2, split 2 and lost 22. I had 75% or greater equity in every single one.

I was running quite a bit under EV before this so I don't even want to know.  Yesterday I went through and reviewed any hand over $10 bucks in the bovada hand history thing in the client and I wasn't too upset with myself. There were some things I should have done better but overall i played above average to how I normally do, just bad luck.  edit: since i'm moving down a couple stakes to make up for the bad discipline I won't be purchasing the plo100 version since it is going to be a long time until I move up.

poker,3cnvwh,darkfangs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:08 2015 UTC,I don't think this should stop you from learning plo if you want. I assume this is an insane outlier. I was a 15bb/100 winner over 70k hands prior to this insane runbad and was slightly below ev even at that. The players are much worse. I played normal 2 card holdem poker last night to see if it would be easier to run it up there but nope. I am a loser at nl5 zone on bovada before and still am. I am very good at plo equities and hand reading but I can't hand read in texas holdem for shit so that is probably a big part of it.

poker,3cnvwh,darkfangs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn some basics I recommend reading a couple books.   http://www.gamblingsystem.biz/books/  I've read the pot limit ohmaha- big play strategy book by jeff huang and it was great. Pretty much any book about omaha from him is going to be good. The book I read goes over starting hands, post-flop play and general strategy. It was written for 9-man table play but it should give you a good idea of where to start.  I think the easiest mistakes people make when transitioning are starting hand selection and treating postflop play like 2 card poker. hand strength goes way up and you see many more boats,2 pairs, straights and if there is a flush out there and it's a lot of people in a pot someone will more than likely have a flush of some kind."

Here's a 2p2 thread on it (a tad old but probably not obsolete info)  Edit: A post in the thread: 02-24-2013, 01:25 PM   If you are a pro and looking for a place to move, definitely stay away from the Caymans. If you want to move to the carribean, there are much better options for a pro player. They target more conservative, family tourists, and they like their image. If it's just for vacation, just don't mention it and don't send any money to a Cayman bank account from a poker site.   I haven't been in a decade, but from what I've heard, they've gotten more conservative. What enforcement they have, I don't know, but if they somehow find out what you are doing, then I'd expect the worst.

poker,3cnvwh,HurricaneSandyHook,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:36 2015 UTC,"Figure I'll ask in here instead of making a whole new thread.  During my dart league, we play a side money game of ""poker darts"".  We play with the jokers.  Basically you get as many cards as you can during the game by shooting above a certain number of points per inning, and then at the end of the game, 3 cards from the deck are flopped and whoever has the highest hand wins.  Now my question:  Is there an official rule on who wins if someone has a 5 of a kind (joker included) and someone has a royal flush (joker included)?  This happened recently and me and the other dude just split the pot since it was a pretty rare event."
poker,3cnvwh,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"Don't think there is, just make the ruling before you play next time!  I personally think five of a kind is probably harder to get than a royal when you play with jokers, but I'm sure someone can do the math."
poker,3cnvwh,Stixx_27,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the basic math at the very least seems easy.  Maybe I'm over simplifying it?  5 of a kind would be 5 out of 6 exact cards in the deck to make quads (4 of a kind plus one of the jokers, or 3 of a kind plus 2 jokers).  Royal flush would be 5/7 cards in the deck to make a straight flush (4 card straight flush + 1 of the 2 jokers or 3 card straight flush with both jokers).  So it seems like 5 of a kind would be harder to make."
poker,3cnvwh,HurricaneSandyHook,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"Ahh ok.  I just thought maybe there was some established guidelines on such a hand.  I once got both jokers and had 4 of a kind.  pretty cool getting a ""6 of kind"" even though it wasn't a real hand."

Just watch some of those great phil helmuth rants.  He takes it way too hard.     I probably should just shoved the turn so he didn't draw to his two pair.   You should not do that.  The only way someone calls that bet is if you are beat.  You are looking at the hand with perfect hind sight and trying to adjust your play to his crazy strategy.

I guess opponent didn't play bad just trapped me through and went for a big value bet on the river because he reads that I have a 6 and will call that kind size of bet. Would you call a river pot sized bet thats half of remaining stack in that situation? His hand is also soooo disguised I never ever ever put him on that. Trapped me from pre-flop. On the river I really thought he had a smaller 6 that didn't boat up or some busted draw trying to bluff me. I guess he outplayed me.
poker,3cokb3,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:14:50 2015 UTC,I guess you could argue that he hit his T by luck. But lets imagine the chance of him hitting the T is 1/8 and all 8 other guys at the table is doing this to me so the chance I get beat by this is 1/8 * 8  = 100% of the time.....
poker,3cokb3,tswpoker1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:26:17 2015 UTC,Um. . .  I don't know where to begin.    You do understand that taking a 1/8 chance 8 times does not equal 1 right?  This makes me question your ability to make mathematical decisions in poker.  99% of this game is probability.  If you don't understand basic probability then it's time to get your head in a math book before you decide to play more poker.
poker,3cokb3,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry please help me (genuinely, no sacrassm), .. 1/8 * 8 does not equal 1?...  Imagine a table of 13 players including yourself. You hold aces and all others hold KK QQ - 22, if you go all in and everybody calls, you essentially have a 2 outer to win the pot. No probability here but you get the concept."
poker,3cokb3,Spreek,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, lets make this problem a lot more simple.  We are just sitting at our kitchen table flipping a coin.  There is a 1/2 chance that the coin will come up heads.  Does that mean that if I flip the coin twice there is a 100% chance for it to come up heads?    Just like in your example, you don't just start adding up the fractions.  Look at the probability tree.  You can see that in the first level there are two outcomes, either heads or tails.  At the second level there are four outcomes, hh tt ht th.  Three out of four outcomes after two coin flips involve at least one heads.  That means the probability of two coin flips resulting in at least one heads is 3/4.    I don't have enough room here to teach you basic probability, but you really should look into it. There are a ton of online resources to help.  If you want to play poker at any level other than ""play money"" then you need to hammer this stuff."
poker,3cokb3,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes you are flipping it only twice. Playing poker is a long term game so you are flipping ""the thing"" infinite times which infinitely equal to one."
poker,3cq72b,Spewymcgewy,3,Thu Jul 9 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"I like the check here, because if raised it gets gross quick. On turn, we could def consider raising. Would we raise a 4? A set here? Ah2x? If we're only raising flushes here I think it's a mistake. BUT with that said, he bets 66 into 241, fuck that, now we're raising with a lot more hands, and it jsut so happens we have the 3rdnut flush. I think it's fine. Leading river is so face up, and if he's a reg he's going to make no mistakes. I think you're line is fine, but its the turn sizing that makes me think we're making a big mistake not raising."
poker,3cq72b,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:00:14 2015 UTC,"If agree at first I thought pot controlling turn was the way to go, but I think I should have planned to raise turn to get a 1:1 spr. Then on the river checking almost seems better since he may pile it in with worse flushes and the occasional straight/set for thin value. Yeah I'd rather check call river just gives us more room to get value.   As played I don't want to lead river because if he shoves then we're in a gross spot since as you said my hand is fairly face up. We have such a strong hand so having to fold it would be terrible.   On bovada balance doesn't matter as much in these spots. Ranges that appear often like BTN vs BB I'm fairly balanced, but with the anonymous tables we can raise exploitably against a lot of opponents here since we'll never get in a spot where they can exploit my range. I do understand what you're saying though about balancing just doesn't apply on bovada IMO."
poker,3cq72b,SkeetRag,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"Not many other flushes worse than yours out there though, you block so many. I would raise turn 100%, and bet 50-65% pot river. HJ doesnt matter one bit here, hes got 15 bigs. For the turn sizing we must raise here or we're leaving value on the table, and run this 100000 times this should be a spot we get heaps of value.   ** Didn't realize bovada, I think people have to start disclaiming this, it's such a unique site in really effects replies."
poker,3cq72b,Gnarzz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:40 2015 UTC,It's pretty fun to play on. You can make weird plays and the fish are a plenty.   Also given his actual holding I doubt we get any action when we c/r but regardless I left value on the table by not raising turn.
poker,3cq72b,SkeetRag,2,Fri Jul 10 02:40:28 2015 UTC,I'm curious why we're checking the river
poker,3cq72b,flipperstf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:54:06 2015 UTC,Right or wrong my thoughts were that if we lead out hand is fairly face up. I'm not leading as a bluff here or with an over pair.   So if I lead say 55% pot and he shoves we're in a terrible spot. I'll probably have to fold a very strong hand which I don't want to do.
poker,3cq72b,je-rock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, leading river isn't really balance-able either, and far to obvious versus a reg."

poker,3cq72b,withoutatrace123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"With the all in player your fold equity isn't clean.  Presumably you have good equity against the all in player, but it is probably around 60/40 rather than in a normal situation where you take the whole pot when you fold everyone out with your shove.  Due to this I don't think you win enough when you fold everyone out to make up for getting called by better FD's (lot of Ace and King high flush draws), straights, sets, and two pairs.  I also don't see many hands we are clear favorites over when called except exactly 9Thh, but that calling is debatable.  Basically when we jam and get folds we still have to get there and when we jam and get called we have are in rough shape."
poker,3cq72b,NastyGuido,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:14:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm I somewhat agree, I think you're wrong in saying our fold equity isn't clean though,  obv to win this pot we have to get there since there is already an all in player. However , if we jam and the non all in player folds we don't need as much equity against the all in player cause of the dead money."
poker,3cq72b,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah but we can't rely on villain folding cause say I raise to 165 after shorty shove and villain calls. Yes we may clear out his equity, but what if villain shoves all in? Then we're in a bad spot where we are maybe getting are money in drawing at best 30% or virtually dead if he holds the nut flush draw."

They're not 4betting AK. I can count the number of 4bets I've seen on one finger. I don't think it's out of consideration to give the guy a range of KK-AA there and find a fold.  I have seen at least three people that put in humongous raises with KK and AA, I'm talking 5-10x.  I'm not saying I could actually fold there myself, but I think it is the right play."

poker,3clz4d,IAmTheKingofEngland,7,Thu Jul 9 01:53:57 2015 UTC,"Bummer man. You should have folded based upon his table talk, but I know it's not easy.  Last time I played the ME was 2007 (I played from 2005 to 2007 and never made it past day 1). I had a nice chipstack in the last level of play. CO raised, I reraised KK on the button. CO called. Flop Jc9c2x. He checks, I bet, he goes all in (I'm getting about 2:1 on the call. If I win the pot, I'm likely in top 10 of chips).  I think much like you I felt pained immediately. A $200 online MTT, I'm snapping this all day. But it felt like something was up. But I felt the pot odds and relative positions just meant I had to call.And then he said ""I have you beat."" I think it was his desperate attempt to get me to call because he thought I was folding. But it terrified me, and made me want to fold instead of call.  But I ignored my instincts, and called. He flopped top set and I was out and he was one of the chip leaders.   I'm not going to lie, on occasion I think of the hand and it bothers me. Your instincts said fold, but it would have been the biggest fold of your life. I would try to take solace in the fact that the people who are going to make the final table won't have to make these decisions, and if they do, they probably get their 20% and keep going.   Congrats on the experience, and just use it as motivation to keep learning. There's always a main event next year."

poker,3clz4d,wallymomouth,10,Thu Jul 9 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"Granted I play cash game, but I only start thinking about folding KK preflop when the effective stack is 250 blinds or more.  I believe the same rules can be applied to the first levels of a tournament. The bubble is so far away and the average so low that cEV roughly equals $EV.  In your spot I would have folded my KK only if I had a specific read on the opponent... like, 8 hours of play and villain has only shown value hands, he flatted other 4bets IP with QQ KK AKs, etc.   He told me after the hand he sincerely wanted me to fold because he didn't want his aces to get cracked    Lmao.

Is there really anything wrong with wanting  a fold in that situation? I understand hes an 80% favorite but if you keep getting it all in with same stack sizes even as an 80% favorite, variance is eventually going to catch up to you in a tournament that takes so many days to complete."

poker,3clz4d,duskhat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. With how deep we are, a 5bet shove from BTN is one of 3 hands. KK is out so you are up against AK or AA.

poker,3clz4d,Witcrew,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:17:02 2015 UTC,Prob not even 4betting ranges here Guna be so narrow since we aren't vs a bluff range close to day 2 bubble
poker,3clz4d,Witcrew,2,Thu Jul 9 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"All signs pointed to him having aces.   You could of folded with 30K left, plenty of wiggle room left for the tournament with 150/300 blinds.  4 bet. You raised in early position, so in his mind he knows you have a monster pair when you raised to 10K. He probably wanted you to fold so he could just scoop up a big 10K profit without worrying about a bad beat. That makes sense of why he went all in right away.   I doubt he would push all in with AK after a re-raise to 10K.   How old was the guy? It sounds like he was in his 40s."
poker,3clz4d,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:50:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but sensing that he wanted me to fold (with such a quick all-in and his chatting) is precisely why I called, unfortunately. He was early 30s"

What he did makes you think ""theres no way someone would go all in that quick with aces"" because most people don't want to blow their opportunity. So they will think it out...tend to overthink it. Sometimes you gotta play like a maniac with monster hands to throw people off.  I've had guys tell me before they have aces and while it's hard to believe them, they sometimes don't want to see a flop if they can just pick up a good enough stack to avoid a bad beat."

poker,3clz4d,duskhat,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"If you had 20K behind you after that raise, it would be really tough to fold. I would probably call. With 30K behind you I think you were too worried about falling behind in chip count too much. Gotta let them go.  Especially when the guy snap goes all in. Most people won't do that with AK or AQ. They do that with Aces or Kings because they know theres really nothing else that can beat them. Tough break. Good luck next year if you play again."
poker,3clz4d,Alienmonkeyman,3,Thu Jul 9 00:18:24 2015 UTC,"Standard cooler. Against AA,AK you have the equity to call. He should be shipping QQ+ here and possibly stuff like AQs. Nobody expects you to fold KK pre unless you're against a mega nit who 100% for certain has AA."

At the time she asked the question I responded, absolutely. As time has passed I think back on the question, and I'm not quite sure if I would. Sure it's the best hand but now my approach to the game has changed soo much. Part of me says hell yes, AA or KK facing an all in, definitely call. Now I take ICM into account and in my own experience I prefer to play small ball, take a little here and there and don't risk my stack. Overall, you took a shot and missed. Nothing wrong with that what so ever, get'em next time.   My #1 thing I hate hearing from my opponents, ""if you fold, I'll show you."""

Maybe he'll call with TT/JJ and some 9x  Hand 2 just call and evaluate River folding seems bad with the fish still in the pot and given the strength of your hand. If it checks to you on the river you may be able to get value out of weaker Jx and stubborn pairs. Folding to river aggression though.

poker,3cnfex,LostInPoker,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:34:48 2015 UTC,"You have 6BB left so that is a completely correct shove in that situation regardless of position. There's no further analysis beyond that really.   If you want confimation just google for ""push fold charts"" and you will see that you did the right thing....you just got a little unlucky to run into someone with another A to cut you live cards down to one. Even up against a smaller pocket pair it's a coin flip.   Hey ho...move onwards."
poker,3cnfex,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:15:57 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the opinions guys I guess my play was decent but as someone said the range of calling hands was much greater than I originally thought. I guess I was thinking of calling hands that dominated me or were heavily favored. Someone who needed to make a move could have called with any pocket pair or something of the sort. Thanks all for the analysis

poker,3clupo,Furples,2,Thu Jul 9 04:26:10 2015 UTC,First off nice video mate.  Interesting tight fold at 9.30. What do you think about this spot? Seemed pretty tight but then again you just don't beat much. All you can really beat is a bluff OTF which opts to continue with a scare card OTT and decides the only way to win the pot is to jam the rest OTF.
poker,3clupo,9betfold,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:05:45 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to call tbh, but looking back I think it's better to fold. CO calls a 3b IP, and bets when checked to on flop for a standard ~60% on a pretty dry flop. We never have 33/55, sometimes we elect to 3b TT. He has all these sets, and would bet out. I doubt he bets AX unpaired, but could def bet A3s, A5s, ATs. He'd bet 66-AA for sure, and lower potentially give up right away. He could also bet a bunch of overcards, BDFDs etc.   On turn, while we improve, this hand CLEARLY hits our range, as we're checking most of our AX, and when we call twice, are fairly face up. He bets again, which says he's not afraid of the A, as an A that bets flop probably doesn't bet turn w/o 2p. Notice the sizing increases to 70%. Seeing as we have no hands on him, he doesn't have any on us, meaning he might think we're tight in this spot and onyl ever have Ax and overpairs, and unlikely to fold our AX. He could definitely of played and suited spade hands this way that have some SDs or whatever, but I think he realizes he has very little fold equity as our line looks very stationy.   Readless, I think it's a fine fold, assuming he's a mass multitabler and not particularly aggressive to trip barrel when checked to. Vs a fish, we're calling, vs a probable reg, can't see it being +EV. Essentially, he knows the hand we hold, and bets turn and river with little FE, unafriad of our holdings."
poker,3clupo,Furples,2,Thu Jul 9 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"Precisely my thoughts, nice analysis man. Seemed tight in the moment but when you actually play the hand through you just don't beat much of his range at all."

poker,3clupo,Furples,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:49 2015 UTC,"that was a really interesting hand. I think you could even argue exploitatively folding turn when he (as a reg) bets, and bet folding river brick when he checks back turn."
poker,3clupo,Spacezup,2,Thu Jul 9 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Somebody limped small blind and you tagged them as a rec. I think that's not a bad idea but when somebody limps SB at 25NLz imo there's an 80% chance they are fish and 20% chance they are total wizard. Just food for thought cuz I've seen some good players try a limping from Sb strategy The AK hand is pretty gross. Your hand is pretty face up and unless villain is turning a made hand into a bluff I can't see him getting the river with many bluffs unless its a spaz. He has all the sets, all the AT combos, maybe some A9 combos too. Puke fold. From a balance perspective as long as we check/call some sets or AA then we're not at the top of our range so it can't be too bad I suppose My default is to check back the KJ after we 3bet on JT7r, but I'm not sure if that's bad or not. I feel like our hand doesn't need that much protection because overcards that improve villain also give us some equity. I'm not planning to bet 3 streets there so I think a check is good if we don't need much protection"
poker,3clupo,Clarityy,3,Thu Jul 9 03:47:35 2015 UTC,Folding AK that hand from a balance perspective has to be terrible.  We do not have nearly enough sets to justify it.
poker,3clupo,roscos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:23:23 2015 UTC,If we occasionally check/call AA it can't be awful. You're probably right but for somebody to exploit us I feel like they have to turn made hands into bluffs. It's hard for villain to get to the river with many bluffs.

Just having a quarter of a second headstart on your move seems to make it seem much more confident. And I don't mean just betting quickly or anything. Even the way they see you react to the board works better if you already know what to do.

poker,3co2bh,ichliebekuchen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:25:38 2015 UTC,"Him saying this on the epic AKK flop really didn't factor into my fold on the river.  If anything it made me think that he was strong, maybe another AK that he didnt decide to 3bet.  His line of check flop, call turn, and value bet river made me think he had an Ace, something like AJ or AT.  But I suppose hes got some float turn/bluff river in his range too."

poker,3co2bh,Furples,5,Thu Jul 9 13:31:09 2015 UTC,"We can induce bluffs on future streets, our hand needs absolutely 0 protection, we block most straight draws, and we can get 1-2 streets of value by checking back. The only downside is that it's hard to rep a bluff after checking back but live players don't know that"
poker,3co2bh,iamcdr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:02:42 2015 UTC,"Well, we induced a semi bluff and folded to it after delayed cbet."
poker,3co2bh,Furples,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think river is a call tbh. This is still a slam dunk check back, cbetting seems pretty bad. We're never getting 3 streets of value and we don't need protection so why cbet?"
poker,3co2bh,iamcdr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:11:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there is no way I fold that river, but as you can see in a daily thread I might not be the best source.  Considering that the villain called turn bet, I think it's possible to get 3 streets with him. If we bet turn, why not bet river? Bet turn, x/c river? Weird to me."
poker,3co2bh,Furples,2,Thu Jul 9 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"Even if it bricks out like AKK62, do you think villain will call 3 barrels with a hand worse than QQ?"
poker,3co2bh,iamcdr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"Never underestimate the power of live donkaments. I don't think he would call A river, but flop and turn? Yeah, I think so. Does it matter tho? Not really."
poker,3co2bh,Furples,2,Thu Jul 9 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"It does matter. As you've just pointed out, villain is unlikely to call 3 streets with worse. Therefore we're targeting 2 streets on most runouts. With a hand that doesn't need protection, surely betting turn and river is better than betting flop and turn?"
poker,3co2bh,iamcdr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"I meant that my opinion if villain calls or not doesn't matter.  I'd rather bet flop and turn, than turn and river. Why is the latter better?"
poker,3co2bh,Furples,2,Thu Jul 9 14:57:43 2015 UTC,Oops that makes more sense. The advantage to turn/river is that villain might take a stab after we check back. If our hand needed protection then flop/turn would be better imo. Checking back flop also works better for pot control and protects us against a spazzy bluff if we bet flop/turn and villain bluffs river
poker,3co2bh,Furples,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:06:21 2015 UTC,What do you think of how he played the hand? Floating turn with a bluff catcher and betting river when checked to with Ten high.
poker,3co2bh,Slinger17,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:39:26 2015 UTC,Villain is clicking buttons but I think his bluff is pretty good on the river because we have a lot of pocket pairs that can't really call. It just so happens we have the nut no pair but with hands like 99 or TT it's not like we can call

poker,3cmjlo,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:24:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's perfectly fine. If you've been opening 4x utg up until this point then continue doing that.

If you're in late position and you hold marginal cards (say unsuited connectors or suited double-gappers etc) with several limpers, are you still playing raise-or-fold?"
poker,3cmjlo,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. Open limping is super weak, let me just clarify that open-limping means you are the first one to call the blind. If you someone has limped before you there are spots where limping si good.  If you are playing against someone competent they will raise a wide range to isolate you. If you are limp/folding you are burning money, if you are limp/calling you are burning money.  Unless you are balancing your limping range by limping strong hands, in which case you are losing value with your strong hands and therefore burning money.  The only POSSIBLY profitable place you can have a limping range is if it's folded to you in the SB, but even then I would not recommend this.  Open raise or fold when it's folded to you, 100% of the time."
poker,3cmjlo,iamzheone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:49:57 2015 UTC,Don't like the reraise. As played you are priced in to call with your 9+ outs.
poker,3cmjlo,iamzheone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Flop raise may be ok but that turn raise is without a purpose was it intended for value or bluff?  If you think that you're ahead you still shouldn't raise. Some hearts can improve their hand (some straight draws on that board). Fold if the river is 8 or K.  Just call/fold the turn, she priced you in for the river and you still have room to fold to the shorter stack who would have:  1-raised over your bets; he would have had 1$ to bet in a 1$ pot giving you an easy fold if he bets more than 60c (at this point he knows his bets sizings and probably check folds any heart)  2-Min raised; giving you a good price to call and see a river with 2 players as implied odds  3-continued trapping; and would probably have called a good river bet since he's committed and suck for the way he didn't make you pay that crazy wet flop.  If you want some fold equity just go for a big raise on the flop. :)"
poker,3cmjlo,iamzheone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"My thought process was actually:  The guy who donked felt very weird , hes range is polarized so I called the flop bet for the priced in draw with implied odds. His turn bet felt very weak again, 2 players to act behind, wet board, if he has a strong value hand hes gotta bet stronger than half pot so I raised hoping to semi bluff off his bluff range hands like ace highs and was ready to raise/fold. The guy behind me was a shorter stack and I didn't put him on a strong hand , AQ would raise the flop certainly. I was quite confident that he didnt have a strong value hand and I have a high percentage of chance semi-bluffing off his medium strength hand. What I didnt expect was that rejam, but at that time I was getting more than 4 to 1 on my money with 14 outs (I believe is 32:14 ~= 2.5:1)  so I snap called assuming he has a strong value hand and I am not drawing dead."
poker,3cmjlo,RudolfKGB,2,Thu Jul 9 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"I wrote this for you. please read it trough my emotion changes please.  Your move is bad in heads up and is bad in a 3-way pot.  After the retarded raise it's obviously a call. That's not what I'm saying. The MOTHERFUCKING problem is how you got MOTHERFUCKING trapped.  Why would you want to stack off in a 4:1 situation?  You don't want that.  This is why you try not to throw money around when at 25% at the absolute best when you have 0 fold equity.  And you certainly don't argue that it's a nice hand.  Don't tell me how well you threw your last money in because you were fucking priced in at that point.   I name that poker move  *the last call of the shameful failed bluff*  Nah I'm joking, tell me more about how getting in a pot sized bet as a bluff (25% is not a semi bluff it's a 3/4 bluff and that ain't shit to be proud of when it simply never works.   When raised and forced to call the rest off, you goddamn know that you're losing this 3 times to win once If called (100% of the time). You're losing the odds of him bluffing you with a worst hand than you if this is what you believe he's doing. (your last hope at that time)  At this point I'm mad. Poker is not about finding the worst spot to suckout, it's about dodging them. And you, Sir, did poorly at that.  Here's some of many reasons why:  YOU TRIED TO BLUFF IN 2NL. IN YOUR POST,  NOT A SINGLE CALL OF HIS WILL GIVE YOU MORE THAN 25% EQUITY. LIKE, NO HAND COMBINATION. AT ALL.  THE FACT THAT YOU BELIEVE THEM BOTH TO BE FISHES IS A RED FLAG. FLASH NEWS: FISHES DON'T FOLD. THAT'S THE BASELINE OF ALL THE FISHES THAT YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN YOUR STAKE.  IS IT CLEAR HOW HORRIBLE OF AN OPTION THE RAISE WAS??? NEVER DO IT AGAIN WITHOUT A REAL READ ON MANY MANY HANDS. IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE ON YOUR FISH CATEGORIZATION GO LEARN THAT. NOW.  FUCKING LISTEN TO WHAT'S COMING. IT'S KEY: THE ONLY WAY I CAN SEE YOU BET THIS ON THE TURN (LIKE, WTF) IS IF YOU CAN BET SMALL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FOLD IF HE SHOVES SINCE HE NEVER! EVER! FLOAT RE-REAISE THE TURN AS A BLUFF. EVER. SO IT BECOMES A REAL EASY DICISION. HE HAS IT AND YOU KNOW IT.   IN THE PARALLEL DIMENSION YOU FOLD SINCE YOU LOST HALF OF YOUR OUTS WHEN THE TURN HIT AND YOU'RE HAPPY TO HAVE HAD A SOLID CHANCE TO TRAP HIM (WITH A GREAT PRICE ON THE FLOP).   YOU HAD THE POSSIBILITY TO HAVE ANOTHER GOOD PRICE ON THE TURN BUT YOU FUCKED IT ALL UP! LIKE WTF!  HEY! LOOK! I FOUND A WAY TO SAVE YOU MONEY BUT I SEE THAT YOU DON'T GIVE A FUCK SINCE IT INVOLVES FOLDING AT SOME POINT. YOU ARE A FISH WHO PLAYED THAT HAND THE ABSOLUTE WORST WAY POSSIBLE.  --JUST BEHIND DONK SHOVING YOUR SECOND PAIR ON THE RIVER--  COLD TRUTH.  IT'S OBVIOUS THAT IF WE CALL AND THE BB-DONK HITS HIS STRAIGHT AND IT'S NOT A HEART IT BECOMES THE EASIEST FOLD OF ALL TIME SINCE THAT FISH IN THE BLINDS WILL MAKE A FUCKING HUGE BET TO MAKE SURE THAT ONLY REAL SHITS AT POKER CAN CALL.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAN BETWEEN ALL THE HANDS WE ARE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO SEE A RIVER THE MOST WHEN ON THE TURN?? WE DON'T HAVE FOLD EQUITY HERE. Here take a look at this formula;  SHORT STACK + CALL + CALL + NO READ = OH OH! = RAISE IS PROBABLY NOT THE BEST OPTION.  RIVER COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU EVEN MORE MONEY IF IT WAS THE 8h,9h,OR SINCE THERE ARE SOME STRAIGHT DRAWS WHO YOU ARE CRUSHING WITH YOUR SECOND PAIR AND POSSIBLE   FLUSH ANYWAY. OF HEART SINCE YOU SAY THAT HE'LL GET TOP PAIR BUT, HEY! WE HAVE A FLUSH! HE MAY VERY WELL NOT HAVE THE HEART IN HIS HANDS SINCE HE DID BARELL THE TURN. WHERE THE BACK DOOR STRAIGT HE GETS A STRAGHT AND HE DONKS BIG ON THE RIVER SINCE THE CARD IS CLUTCH  but a that Any to a Villain on whom you have no specific information with 25equity. a that you believewho's just tagging along with air since he didn't raise my 4bigblind pre flop raise that screams OVERLY AGGRESSIVE MAN INCOMING.  If he called KK there is no reason why he wouldn't call AQ you scream °trap me° just with your pre flop bet sizing. Plus, apparently there's a donk fish in the BB he wouldn't want to not get that in the flop with him.  You need to understand how hard you got PLAYED BY A FISH for it not to happen again. Tough love. Now go! Be him, he tough you something! Open your spirit brotha..  Anywhore. I'm getting off course here.  Like I was saying: You're ahead of Ax dude of course if the BB donks the flop she 3bets AQ. KK-Guy on the other side isn't a certified fish yet. Not until proven and associated to one type of fish. maybe he saw the donk on the BB spew chips like crazy you came along with your WORTHLESS 4BB OPENING.   At that point, he's the only one who's able to assume that he plays against 2 juicy fishes. The donk one and the 4bb opening one that decide that the turn is the time to throw money in our long-gone pot equity. RIP 50%. It was nice simply calling you on the flop.  My guess is that the less fish off the 3. The KK guy! He spotted the donk in the bb and he was certainly expecting a some craziness.   (Do that! (take notes of other players))  The KK guys vision has been realised soon enough. He received some Donk Bet Spewy money from the BB than you: THE GUY THAT SPAZZED OUT!!  YOU DID MAN!!! FUCKING SEE IT!!!!! HE MORE THAN DOUBLED UP at 75% equity. His flop play may have been sub-optimal, but it worked. It worked because you managed to play worse than him.   With a simple 3bb raise the KK call is way less appealing. Feel me'? It's useless and It's spewy brah.  YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO CREATE PROFILES, AND USE THEM TO FIND WHO TO PUT GENERAL BASIC INFORMATION ON ALL PLAYERS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER.  If he has A high like you believe it's the perfect time to call, AND NOT RAISE, since he bets way over his 7% pot equity on the turn and the call should satisfy you since you never call a value river bet.  NO REASON TO RAISE THIS HAND WHATSOEVER. NOR IN HEADS UP AND CERTAINLY FUCKING NOT WHEN THERE IS A SHORTSTACK BETWEEN YOU TWO!!!!!!!!!!!"

If bilnds are 500/1000 as you mentioned, and someone raises to 2000. Then everyone must put in atleast 2000 chips in the middle to see the flop. The blinds however, already put in Money, so they just have to put the rest in to match up. so small blind have to call 1500 and big blind Another 1000"
poker,3cn92m,Franszon,2,Thu Jul 9 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"Except the answer is completely wrong.  Everybody, including the blinds, can always fold.   Can the blinds fold, or do they need to match the man's $2000? Can everyone in a pre-flop fold?   Yes, the blinds can fold, they don't have to match anything.  Everyone pre-flop can fold.   Also, what if no one but the blinds fold? Does the small blind have to match the big blind's bet, or can the small blind fold?   The small blind can fold.  The big blind then wins if everyone else has folded."

poker,3cjhtm,Ckaine8,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:24:32 2015 UTC,Most likely depends if the board texture changed. A lot of fish use the min donk as a sort of blocker bet to get a cheap turn card without having to call a normal size bet themselves. Then they normally just bomb it when they hit. If I have at least a pair on the flop I'm attacking these min donks pretty relentlessly. Bluffing at them is pretty futile ime because they will call anyways.

Villain goes for 2 bb raise, which I call because it's such a low bet size that before I fold I could hope for any other q 4 8 t to back up my set of T.  River: 8s  I check. He raises me 1/2 pot, I raise all-in because all I could muster is a flush in his range.  He calls.  He had 36hh so my flush read was right"
poker,3cjhtm,f1zban,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:07:46 2015 UTC,"I dont like the line personally.  You can bet big to get people off of a small flush (which is exactly what he had).  He probably called the all in because of the c/c 2 bb.  If you c/r'ed there I think that he would have found a fold for the river shove.  I think you should have c/r'ed the turn because his 2bb bet makes no sense.  It screams weak flush.  No way is a 9h+ betting 2bb into 16bb. However, because you called the 2bb he knew you didnt have a value hand either (if you did then you would want more money in the pot). Overall I dont think the all in on the river makes much sense to him, which is why he called."
poker,3cjhtm,Riniat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:20:45 2015 UTC,thanks for the input. you may be right. but I slowplayed the hand because I kinda knew there was a flush going. By slowing down the play and his really misplaced 2bb bet on the turn I got the time to not fold on the turn. River gave me the checkmark and so I used it.  If I have not gotten the full house on the river (10 over 8) there was no way I could shove him out of this hand.  But thanks for your thinking input. Helps alot !
poker,3clfhq,McGradeN,3,Wed Jul 8 20:41:58 2015 UTC,Make it bigger pre if you want to isolate a limper. Bet turn. As played call river. If he has a 4 or 8xdd then that's nice for him. He has plenty of random other missed diamonds that are bluffing here.
poker,3clfhq,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:17:48 2015 UTC,You'd make it 3.5 or 4?
poker,3clfhq,iamzheone,2,Wed Jul 8 23:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'd go for 1800 probably. You are likely to have some fold equity against UTG making it 3x and the blinds aren't going to be as tempted to come along, even if it is only a small difference they're more likely to perceive it as stronger."
poker,3clfhq,RudolfKGB,2,Wed Jul 8 23:50:34 2015 UTC,"You checked turn so it's standard to call river. I'd prefer bet/fold closer to 1/3 on the flop and bet/fold turn (like half pot). I don't give a free card.  If he sees you as a TAG, he's probably always betting busted flush draws on that river since you checked the turn and his sizing is standard.  Now if I try to go in depth: If he's a good LAG, he always 3bet K8+ and TT+. More than he would try to trap. He would, also, more often then not lead the turn with 77, 88, and 99 for protection and/or would river bet smaller with those (77-99) Since he wants an Ax call  So he can -theoretically-  pretty much only have sets/quads( 3x33 + 3x6 + 3x88 + 1x44 = 10 combinations) or Air: suited broadways (JT, QT, KT, KQ, KJ). So I believe that there's more combinations of hands that beat you than ones you beat (10 vs 5). Anywhore, pretty sure the dead money and the fact that he often 3bet 88 makes it a +EV call.  Sorry if the upper part is shit I'm tired and never write those kind of posts. I usually go by gut in those situations.  The only way I could possibly fold is if he tank very long on flop since it's more often a snap call with flush draws than it is with a monster Or if I find the timing suspicious in any other way white magic. I'ts my personal online read, but again, I never bet half pot when it's 3 way.. talk about pot control.. you better have a plan before your first action next time.  One love.  What did he have?"

You could possibly have been trapped with TT+, If we add the trapping hands to his range: TT,JJ (we take out KK,AA since he never play those 3 ways) we have 8 more combinations against us making it 5/18.   When you pay your 4.2k your odds of shipping it are 1/3.5  Our pot odds are: 4200/19900=1/4.7  It's +EV but a really risky move that I'd rather not do if villain has trapping cards in his range or your player read could be a bit off and he's not a lag but a passive fish/preflop calling station with with 8x in this calling spot. Spewy, sure, but that's live poker for you. IDGAF. There will be a better spot for those chips later on."
poker,3clfhq,iamzheone,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm just smoking weed and adding shit!  Anyone wants to give their opinion on my reasoning?  Is calling with TT or JJ a stardard move live? I'd like to know.

poker,3clfhq,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:53:33 2015 UTC,I'm curious whether you guys call or fold the river but also what you think about any street. I wanted to pot control on the turn but I don't know how I feel about it now.
poker,3clfhq,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:50:26 2015 UTC,"Your sizing is a little out of control, but you check on the turn to call on the river so call I guess.  It's also a little tough to figure out without stacks."
poker,3clfhq,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"Stacks are there except for the UTG guy, I had 21,000 to start the hand and villain has me covered, probably like 32,000 ish. What is out of control about the sizing?  *Edited original post with approximate stacks."
poker,3clfhq,The-Doctor-94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"Oh shit sorry, I totally overlooked that.  The sizing is a little on the large side which is bad because you are only playing 35bb deep.  1275-1325 pre is prob better, and then you can cbet around the same on the flop.  Anyone who is folding is folding either way, anyone who is calling is calling either way.  Makes your river decision a little easier as, like I said, you're checking turn to induce."

poker,3cm87q,82930748-1,4,Thu Jul 9 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"I really would prefer a text version rather than a video.  I think I go for three streets here. Turn check just seems poor, we still get value from ATs QQ JJ and TT is simply a tiny part of his range and it's basically the only hand that beats you (AA might flat vs utg+1 3bet, to be fair). But I definitely don't think you did anything particularly wrong other than maybe miss a street of value against most of his range.  River call is obviously correct.  As for your thoughts (which I looked at after typing up the above):   One he flats flop, I think it's likey he setted   No, that's ridiculous. This is just 20/20 hindsight. You range him on QQ-TT and then think he's setted when he calls flop? Massive thought process leak here.   (and I don't think he's the type to call with AK, AQ)   Based on what?"
poker,3cm87q,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:35:01 2015 UTC,Do you know any text converters for BetNow?
poker,3cm87q,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:48 2015 UTC,"I do not, is there really no text hand history in that software?  It's just a little thing for me, I find analyzing in text much easier but the video will do, I'm glad you added some thoughts etc to OP rather than just ""how you YOU play this? link"".  I hope my thoughts make sense, let me know if you disagree with anything.  Basically against a range of QQ-TT ATs river is a super easy call, and I think all of these hands would have called turn and called river too (TT raises riv obv). I don't think we induce villain to bluff river by checking turn so I think you missed value.  Maybe I'm wrong about your post-hand read, but I do feel like ""I felt like he had a set"" is a little silly and you should reflect on whether you really felt this way at the time, and if you did then if it was justified. Like does villain really play QQ-JJ differently? There's 12 combos of them, only 3 combos of TT. So if those are his only hands then he has a set 20% of the time here."
poker,3cm87q,DTFBobSaget,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"There is a text hand history. However, it doesn't allow you to copy from it , which is ridiculous.   Based on playing with Villian, I think he is definitely re-popping QQ preflop. JJ, not so sure.   I think on the flop, too, at least at micro, Villain is most often check-raising the flop with an overpair for protection and value - at least with QQ-AA.   I suppose a flat with JJ would be reasonable given my fairly strong pre-flop raise which suggests I am holding something premium.   Thanks for your insight. I am new to analyzing hands and have only been actively trying to improve my game the last couple of weeks."

poker,3cm87q,Clarityy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:45:04 2015 UTC,I'd play the same way but it's definitely in my mind that he could have any set. Your assigned range is way narrower than it probably is in reality. You really think the only thing he could possibly have based on action pre is TT or JJ? If that's true then this is the most predictable player ever.
poker,3ck6bi,tangv,2,Wed Jul 8 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an angle shoot to me. You have the nut 1 pair, there's a cub draw out there your hand is strong. I'd continue with your original bet and he'll likely fold. If he ships it, reevaluate. My guess would be that he's not playing stupid and he's just being a LAG. So that means he's got 2 pair plus. You'd be also getting a touch over 4:1 to call...not a fun spot to be in"
poker,3ck6bi,ShaggyB,2,Wed Jul 8 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I probably interpret the opposite from his angling. I think I would have to put him on a K with a flush draw. from V's perspective the OOT shove can not only potentially slow you down, but also get you to fold, and he also has a lot of showdown value with a card to go. He is calling any bet with 13 outs on the turn with his stack anyway and he gives you fold equity with top pair for another shot at taking it down."
poker,3ck6bi,brangd0n,2,Wed Jul 8 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"never folding. villain's aggressive actions before I acted make me want to get it in even more.  if we're getting leveled by a fish acting strong when he actually is strong, so be it."
poker,3ck6bi,bradswilson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:18:42 2015 UTC,That's literally all fish ever do.
poker,3ck6bi,jksmlmf,2,Thu Jul 9 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"I think I'd have to call this spot. He probably has some ridiculous two pair like K9 or K4 but he could even have some kind of K high flush draw as well.   If you could afford to reload, it might be worth it to call in this marginal spot for the additional value of seeing what villain is doing here as well. Tough spot"
poker,3ck6bi,Tiltboy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:37 2015 UTC,"The people saying he has 44 / 99 here?????? Why would you ever shove out of turn with essentially the nuts? More likely he has AX, 94, 4Xcc, some weird JTcc or KXcc. He probably knows its going in so he's trying to create some fold equity or something like that (sometimes these live players just do really stupid things). I would snap call. If you're behind, then good hand.  Edit: or maybe he was tilted because you took 45 seconds to count out your bet when its going in regardless"
poker,3ck6bi,Arenatank,2,Wed Jul 8 17:24:35 2015 UTC,OP did you call? What did he have? I'm curious..
poker,3ck6bi,DatGrag,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:01 2015 UTC,I folded. I first put him on K9 but looking back it seems more like a Kx flush draw.
poker,3ck6bi,DatGrag,2,Wed Jul 8 22:00:27 2015 UTC,Dumbass lost $55
poker,3ck6bi,De-Trout-Spinners,2,Wed Jul 8 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"Your examples does NOT demonstrate that this guy is aggressive. They show he is a loose passive donk, who calls with anything, but raises when he is pretty sure he has the best hand. The guy who called with QQ needs his head checked.  His speech sounds super strong, as do his betting patterns. I'm certain he has the best hand, I think his range is exactly K9, K4, 44 or 99.   You need 19% equity in the hand to make the call and vs that range you don't even have that.   You should fold unless you have a useful read: ie some evidence that he runs bluffs with 0 fold equity or evidence that he massively overplays something like AJ in this position."

poker,3ck6bi,flipperstf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:47:17 2015 UTC,I was counting out the chips and he sticks the rest of his stack across the line even though I'm still first to act. I checked and action was back to me whether to call/fold.
poker,3ck6bi,Rockwallguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:51:16 2015 UTC,That's dope haha whan an idiot he pretty much gave you position and an opportunity to not give away 50 bucks if you wanted to fold.
poker,3ck6bi,withoutatrace123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"You confuse me because, like someone else said, you claim he is aggressive but the examples you show are really just loose passive and mostly terrible. I can't tell whether your read is bad or if you just picked bad examples to make your point.  That being said, I have top top and I'm not folding to a guy who is demonstrably bad.  Unless I have a specific read that the guy is never aggressive without 2 pair or better (and this is the majority of 1/2 players I play against, but this guy doesn't strike me as a nit), I'm just not folding.  He is showing strength with his speech, but in my experience, that is more often weakness.  I bet the $50 I was originally going to bet and snap call his shove.  If he's got it, good for him.  My guess is that his most likely 2-pair hands are kings up, so when I'm wrong, I probably have 8 outs.  My one caveat is that I'm pretty LAG and this hand is pretty nutted for my 2-barreling range.  If he perceives you as tight, this may skew toward a check/fold.  I never know how nits make money, so listen to someone else if that's your preferred style."
poker,3ck6bi,MathW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:59:46 2015 UTC,Yeah he's more of a loose aggressive donk than passive. Not a good player but thought I was behind on the turn at the time.
poker,3ck6bi,MathW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Unless you have evidence he likes to play draws aggressively, I expect this is A9/A4/K9/99/44 most of the time. There's 0 chance this guy is LAG. He's a calling station who only raises when he has 2p+. I would call with AK and A9 and fold the rest."

poker,3cm21u,duskhat,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Fold pre. K9s is crap UTG and should be thrown away. If we're not cbetting TP2K what are we cbetting? V seems like a typical passive fish and he would continue with a lot of 2nd best hands. We can beat a lot of non-bluffs here so we should cbet for value. I'm a fan of the turn lead bet. We have 2p, leading looks bluffy, and you cannot let XcXc draw for free on this board. Sigh fold river. Flush probably got there."
poker,3cm21u,withoutatrace123,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:11 2015 UTC,K9s is a little wide but probably fine. I think we can check our entire range on this flop   I think leading turn is a thought we should consider but villain does have more 7x in his range than we do so I do prefer check/calling.  Villain's range is not just flushes on river
poker,3cm21u,Clarityy,2,Thu Jul 9 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"I rethought it and I agree we should x our entire range OTF. We are most likely getting 1 bet out of 22-66 anyway.   Concerning the river, I think he x his Kx hands behind or bet/folds river instead of taking the overbet line. He probably doesn't have just flushes OTR but our hand has been turned into a pure bluff-catcher. Unless you think he's super bluffy and bluffing more than 40% of the time I would give it to him. If the 2d had appeared on the river, we could call because we beat his semibluff range which is now busted FD."

What I meant is that's it's not insanely hard if you put a but of effort into trying to find one. Here are some way I would try:   Ask reddit if anyone knows of any home games in your area (either on /r/poker or your local city subreddit) Look on 2+2 home games http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/182/home-game-listings/ Ask around to people that you know in your area who you know play cards  If you do go to a casino talk to some of your table mates about wanting to get involved in a home game and see what they say. Obviously use judgement here and make sure the person seems normal/not sketchy.  I know some people have used this site but I never had much luck with it:   http://www.homepokergames.com/find-games-us-illinois.php  Sometimes it can just be dumb luck too.

poker,3cj56y,AllTooNew,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:40:22 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I've got one of my sessions on YouTube ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlmcTTKcjU ). Compare that to your average Stars game and you'd probably notice a huge difference :)
poker,3cj56y,MrMogz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:46:47 2015 UTC,"1000% it is. I'm crushing 30NL Snap over a large-ish sample now. Even though there may only be like 40-80 ppl in the Snap pool, every night I play it's the same regs, some of the same fish and a ton of new fish, everyyy day! There are lots of fish on PS too of course, but the reg-fish ratio is significantly more weighted towards fish on 888 at 30NL and below. 50NL/100NL is more regs than fish, but there are a lot of fish sitting in these games too.

poker,3cjg7s,returnthebomb1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:42:39 2015 UTC,Can we talk about the pocket 7s around 35.30. Is that just way too massive of a bet? Are we trying to induce a shov from a king who thinks were semi bluffing? I feel like I would have made it 1.50 to try and not force him to fold 99.9% of his range there. I assume since no criticism was provided my understanding of that spot is flawed. /u/patrickblom  Edit: Also I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around why its bad to 3b queens against a good reg from the UTG.
poker,3cjg7s,PatrickBlom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"I do admit it's a huge checkraise. You're certainly right he's going to fold a reasonable ammount of the time but if he calls we have a very easy turn bet (depending on the card), which we can size perfectly to get it all in on the river. (we're playing slightly deeper aswell, 120BB effective stacks)    3betting queens IP can get very ugly against regulars, once they 4bet they will leave you with a very tough discission. I do sometimes  flat with stronger hands  aswell against regulars, let's take AK on the BTN for example vs a regular raising 3x from MP. If there's fish in the blinds we would love them to come along obviously, and if that doesn't happen we can still find ourselves in a situation where the regular is valuetowning himself with dominated hands.   We've have briefly discussed this in the video aswell, I don't think there are any standards in poker, especially when the stakes get higher. We're always trying to exploit our opponents, I personally capatalize on my opponents being to curious and calling to much. Betting for value way more often and calling less has increased my winrate in a significant way, but as the players we face get better we have to be careful that we're not the ones getting exploited though :)"
poker,3cjg7s,returnthebomb1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. In regards to playing for stacks I think this check raise makes a lot more sense. 3x would make it awkward to shov river, but then again it possible he thinks the awkward jam is a busted draw which would be similar logic to the later hand with 5s.   I mentioned in your other thread that I am just now learning the game so flatting strong hands to try and induce calls from fish is a new concept to me. I think my own logic is that im scared of taking AK multi way, but I am going to start trying to implement similar strategies when I get home. Thanks again for the content."
poker,3cjg7s,PatrickBlom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, keep in mind though position is a pretty important concept for this type of stuff. I'd absolute not recommand to flat AK in the CO because there's a fish on the BTN!  But in general you want to play pots with the weaker players as they will be the ones making the most mistakes."
poker,3ckyu5,82930748-1,9,Wed Jul 8 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"Ok seriously....  You don't care about whatever advice you're going to be given, because your question has a ton of qualifiers. You need to need to need to raise preflop. Everything that happens after is just ridiculous because you did not raise preflop.

If you can't even apply advice you KNOW is correct how are you ever gonna learn to apply other people's advice.  If you really must know, river is a call readless despite being behind quite often."
poker,3ckyu5,Clarityy,-4,Wed Jul 8 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"I often flat here because reraises are often , followed by 4 callers, at which point I raise the shit out of it."
poker,3ckyu5,UndecidedMN,3,Wed Jul 8 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"God no, I hate how you played this from the beginning.  First, i think you should raise pre-flop.  It's six-max so he can't assume you have aces from a 3-bet.  Because you did not raise him pre, you have no idea what he has.    If you don't raise pre, you have to raise on the flop.  Your almost always ahead on the flop (except against J-7 which if you had three-bet pre, he probably would've folded) and need to charge anything that has equity against you (Any Jack or Diamond Draw).    After the turn when you flat call, your hand is face up by flat calling the third diamond.  You have to have a high diamond.  When the fourth diamond comes, and he shoves like that (especially double the pot), what can you ever beat but some weird bluff?  You just played it bad the whole way.  Not trying to be harsh.  You need to raise pre or I guess on the flop.  Probably loose your money anyway if you raise on the flop if he shoves over you, but the way you played it, river call is lighting money on fire."
poker,3ckyu5,RudolfKGB,2,Wed Jul 8 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. Not harsh at all. I played it terribly.   Though I do often see people jam K high, or even Q high for that matter, at this limit."
poker,3ckyu5,boredoo,2,Wed Jul 8 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"Flatting a minraise is begging to play multi way. If they've made it 3x then you can flat sometimes but it's probably not at all worth it at micro stakes where people don't care if you're balanced because they're so exploitable and not paying attention. Not really sure what he's bluffing with on the river, he's not going to 2x pot jam a K high flush or really any flush. Any straights probably just x/c for showdown value or x/f, as does Jx and overpairs. Not like you're ever folding at the time, but if you think about his range he's basically just got a full house here unless you have a read on him that he's 3 barrelling and jamming 2x pot with air."
poker,3ckyu5,myimportantthoughts,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:56 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example of what Limon was talking about in his famous 2p2 thread when he wrote:   I love all of the posts that say disregard everthing I did before I got check raised all in on the river and just tell me what to do now. Its like, “hey Dad its me billy and im in jail. Don’t ask me why I got drunk (standard). Don’t ask me why I drove (yawn). Don’t ask me how my car ended up in a 7-11 (meh). Just tell me how to keep from getting buttfuqqed tonight. The truth is the beginning of the hand is the MOST important part…BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. Just like w/ 9 ball every shot sets up the next shot(s).    With that in mind:  I don't like the flat UTG.  I don't mind flatting big pairs every so often when you have position, against the right villains.  When you do it, you should be doing it with a specific strategy and purpose in mind. For example, to get squeezed by aggrofish in the blinds. Or to keep a super nit in the hand with weaker parts of his range that he'd never call a 3bet with.  Again, you need a specific reason to flat, targeted against a specific villain type.  It's not enough just to flat for deception just because. Otherwise you're missing value.  As far as this hand goes, I'd raise the flop.  The turn I don't think you can raise any longer, and if you did, you'd have to fold to a shove as you now lose to made flushes and trips without the odds to call down.    River is meh.  Sometimes he is bluffing here, repping a big flush.  That's for sure.   But I doubt he's bluffing enough to make this a profitable call.  The flush hits your range more than his, and he's overshipping.  Even if he has a K, that's still a bluff on this board.  He has to know that you likely have a strong hand, and he's willing to ship it there.  You're not getting great odds.  Probably a fold."

poker,3ckyu5,window_turnip,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:23:41 2015 UTC,"This is a call with the nut flush on a paired board, not a call with AA which changes things a lot, I don't think this is a hand you should be folding as standard unless you have a solid read on the villain.   Flat calling with AA is fine, but most of the time to get the most value you should be raising with hands like this, especially at the micros where people are calling too wide. The way the board ran out it's just a bit of a cooler. And FWIW I don't think J9 is ""obviously in his range"" has he raised UTG, so most of the time he shouldn't be showing up with J9o, so the only full houses (or quads) I'd be worried about most of the time would be 77 55 or 99, the fact he's opening J9o utg is good for you in the long run.   Edit: For some reason I thought it was $0.02/$0.05 not $0.25/0.50 so not exactly the micros but still low stakes and still applies.   Edit again: Obviously I wasn't paying attention, you can fold to the 2x pot bet on the end, he's nutted 90% of the time"

poker,3ckyu5,window_turnip,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:15:05 2015 UTC,ugh what is wrong with flatting aces sometimes when there are people behind us who squeeze too often
poker,3ckyu5,Clarityy,0,Wed Jul 8 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ok so if we're on the btn and villain opens co and both blinds squeeze too much then yeah, but we have to go through that mental process for it to be correct. We don't just stumble upon corectness. If we make the ""correct"" decision for the wrong reasons then it's still the wrong decision.  But no, I don't see a scenario where we should flat the utg open from the CO with AA. We are coolering the shit out of UTG here quite often, and we lose SO MUCH value by flatting here it's insane."
poker,3ckyu5,window_turnip,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:21:35 2015 UTC,"So you agree with me correct? My original point was that most of the time we should be raising for value with aces including hands like the one he posted, so I'm not really sure what your point is."
poker,3ckyu5,Clarityy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:26:56 2015 UTC,I agree with you that it's possible that flatting AA vs an open might be correct a non zero percent of the time under the right circumstances.  But that's about it. I don't see how it can ever be correct in these positions unless someone is raising 70% of hands behind us or something.

Quite hard for us to be beat, villains ranges consist of a bunch of Qx and from what I've heard about bovada they will call (and should depending on how they play there ranges on earlier streets.)  I'd think about betting 75% on earlier streets to make this easier."
poker,3cj5te,Spacezup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:19:18 2015 UTC,"Why would Qx call down here (I block AQ as well)? My range is super strong from betting 3 times into two players, I don't think I really have many bluffs in my range in general. I think once I bet river the bottom of my range is AQ , maybe a bluff with AK/AJ spades is also in my range but there's pretty few combos of bluffs compared to percieved value range (AQ/QQ/AA/KK/sets). Especially the small blind, he still has to worry about the big blind if I shove.  I guess the argument that makes sense is just that its Bovada and the players are fishy so I should jam, which is probably right. But if I was playing component players I don't see what value I can get? But then again i can't really see myself being beaten here either."
poker,3cj5te,Spacezup,2,Wed Jul 8 09:49:04 2015 UTC,"I probably have a bunch more bluffs than that, do you not open small SCs from CO? I have loads of busted FDs.  We do block AQ good point. But if villain folds all his Qx then you should jam everything."

poker,3cj5te,Spacezup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:08:44 2015 UTC,Maybes its different on bovada but on stars the regs overfold and obv shouldn't bluff vs fish still.

poker,3cj5te,cobwebscavern,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:39:53 2015 UTC,Am totally fine with the way you have played the hand but cannot understand why you would change the strategy and thinking when it comes time to bet on the river? Maybe if it had paired the board or brought a flush draw in.  Your thinking has been fine the whole way through post flop so I would say if you were beat on the river you were already beat on the flop (funky two pairs or 56 aside)...so why not taken them down to valuetown???
poker,3cj5te,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:36:42 2015 UTC,"Because i got called again twice on the turn by both players.  Especially the big blind what's his range? He should be quite strong in general. Qx or flush draws are by far the most likely, and can I really get 3 streets value from Qx (I block AQ too, and is someone really calling down in a 3 way pot with KQ? (maybe on bovada lol))"
poker,3cj5te,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:47:26 2015 UTC,If you don't think they can call with a queen why wouldn't you bluff with every weak hand in your range?
poker,3cj5te,duskhat,2,Wed Jul 8 09:54:43 2015 UTC,"I think my turn betting range is already pretty narrow and not filled with many bluffs, so when I get to the river there aren't many weak hands. I would continue barreling on the turn with spade flush draws but that's about it, so in general I have more value in the range than bluffs in general."
poker,3cj5te,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:15:47 2015 UTC,"This is all a matter of construction, something I don't know enough about, but again you should be studying your range on the turn and then bluffing at the correct frequency based on the size of the bet (from a GTO perspective).  If you think you can get your opponents to fold a queen exploitatively often then you should be bluffing the turn more often too.   I have never sat down and constructed a range (except for pre flop), but these are the basic principles."

Any set or two pairs beats you......does anyone play any of those pocket pairs like this (with the exception of QQ?)....and it anyone made two pair would they have again played the hand with Q3 or Q8?   So yeah AQ, KQ, Qx flush draws are all in the range but you have these crushed.....I can't see why you would try a value bet in this spot...even if it comes up two folds you have lost nothing and if you get called and they do have the QQ then I don't think that is sometihng you could be faulted for given they haven't shown any aggression.   Just my take...your play may well be more GTO in cash as I am a mostly tourney player."
poker,3cj5te,duskhat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"Bet bigger OTF. AP river is a jam, as others have already said. It's thin but you'll get called by a wide range here"
poker,3cj5te,obeydadawg,2,Wed Jul 8 10:28:56 2015 UTC,"Really thin. Personally, I think a check back is the better play. How many 1p hands are calling us? KQ? AQ? (we have most of the A's). I don't think any 2p/sets are folding, and even though there's not a ton of those there's more of that calling river than Q10 type hands."
poker,3cj5te,duskhat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:16:49 2015 UTC,After further thought (i.e. playing with Equilab) I agree with checking back. Too many 2 pair combos that won't fold. I don't think jamming is that significant a mistake though at 25NL

AK only wins against 72 about 66% of the time. Hands like this can/do happen multiple times in a single session. If this tilts you that badly perhaps poker is not the game for you - not trying to be a dick, just helping you be realistic about the game and the math.   For the record, hands like this can tilt me, too. Ugh, can be especially bad for a huge pot later in an online tourney with blinds/antes are massive and with considerable money jumps."

poker,3ch9ha,SkeetRag,2,Tue Jul 7 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"Watched vid 1:  Slightly hard to follow sometimes because you are 2-tabling zoom, taking notes, looking and the hand replayer, looking at detail HUD and also talking. The tables are slightly blurry and the HUD completely unreadable to me. IMO this is a bit cluttered and hard to follow. I would prefer a single table if you are playing zoom personally.  To undo a self colour tag click the hand replayer and in the hand replayer change your own tag.  The game and stake are exactly the sort of thing I would watch, like that.  I use open broadcaster software and uploaded to Youtube when I did a leakfinder for a nanostakes HUSNG player and I was pretty happy with that, but other people might have better advice.

poker,3cih8p,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:17:11 2015 UTC,I am not a HUD user but I think that I have to agree here. If you had been just up against the seat 1 villian I would have been happy to go to war with the Q's given the high VPIP but the oppposite seems to be true against seat 3.   If you had called and there was a dry flop then I think you are in exactly the same position. You would probably be folding in the face of any bet from Seat 3 given that he would most likely be holding a better pair. The only hand in his range you have assigned to him you'd be beating is AKs.  Given all that I think your fold is good (or shove pre and cross them fingers he has the AKs and your ladies hold up - Not that I am recommending this).

The department of justice shut it down.  And now it's slowly getting regulated on a state-by-state basis.  But only 2 or 3 states have done it so far.  For all the other states in the US, all online poker is still considered ""unregulated"".  Now, does that mean all online poker is illegal?  Well, not on our end.  But the companies that provide the service aren't paying taxes to the US, so it is considered illegal on their end.  This is why it's still a little risky putting a bunch of cash on Bovada/ACR/etc.  Your cash isn't protected at all.  But yea, America, let's focus on getting high and fight for legal marijuana when we still can't even play a legal game of cards online.  Ridiculous."

It's already legal for medicinal purposes in a lot of places.   Even that has been a living hell and still is for most. To this day, it is STILL treated federally as if it has no medicinal uses. We all know it does though.    Don't be naive.     Who is being naive?   This legalization isn't about medical reasons.     To the patients it is. Not to all of us though.    People are pushing for it to be legal for everyone, unrestricted.   If you mean, legal to purchase by adults and restricted by federal law and regulation like alcohol and tobacco, you're right!

On one particular I had played 888 SNAP before and had a blast recording that session. About an hour later I recorded a Stars zoom video and it was absolutely horrific and unpleasant. The average VPIP on stars was nearly cut in half  (11% Zoom 6-max, wtf vs 20% on 888) and it felt like I was playing a bunch of nit grinders. Also they don't tend to make a ton of huge mistakes, so even though we are playing pretty well our winrate isn't going to be that great.

poker,3ci3fv,nickgb5,2,Wed Jul 8 04:35:08 2015 UTC,It's fine to flat A6/K6s/76s/56s/66/44 there.  Personally with those stacks I'd prob shove like 50% of my hands there as the SB...except of course for AA/KK which I would prob flat--c/r.
poker,3ci3fv,nickgb5,3,Wed Jul 8 04:52:50 2015 UTC,I don't agree with flatting any of those hands in the SB with a 10bb stack in the BB oop vs an opener with a 20bb stack. Completely different in the BB or with a deeper BB left to act but with the stacks as they are I think it's a mistake not to be shove/folding 100% of your range unless you are exploiting a tendency by either player.
poker,3ci3fv,IgnoresthePun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:14:58 2015 UTC,"If he has a strong pocket pair (TT+), it might make sense flatting if he is looking to maximize value in a 3 way pot after the big blind shoves? Then, he has the advantageous position of acting last PF, and I might make some mistakes acting before him with a weaker range?"
poker,3ci3fv,kaellinn18,2,Wed Jul 8 14:22:25 2015 UTC,"That would be what I meant by ""exploiting tendencies"", in that if he believes the BB is likely to shove a wider range than they should when he flats he's likely to flat monsters or large pairs. However, if BB isn't shoving very often/wide, then I don't agree with flatting - he's still put in an awkward position on a lot of flops with most big pairs, and he should expect to GII vs you PF a lot when you're dominated. I don't think it's a mistake to flat big pairs, though - my comment was more aimed towards 6s."
poker,3ci3fv,lizzuma,2,Wed Jul 8 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"personally it looks like the large stack bullying with a c/r on a board that never hits your range. the only hands that you are likely behind to are 44,66 both likely to c/call and wait for you to fire again on turn. 88,99,56s,67s that would all likely play c/r some times c/c with the 6 hoping you fire again on turn. TT-AA most likely reraise pre so are less likely. I think calling is the worst option you have because if he fires the turn you still don't know where you are and are 8k less in chips. I think folding is a leak but its better than calling and folding turns. I personally just ship we need a fold 50%ish of the time which we probably get 75% of the time and we sometimes get called by 55 that does the old I put you on AK routine. If the villain is a good thinking player with a large stack then they know how to play the bubble and will continue to apply pressure his bluff raise costs him 12.5k but how many times do you have AK,AQ,AJ,KQ hands that fire a cbet and fold to a raise a lot more time than you having a overpair or connected with this flop. you said he floated earlier so is capable of making a move or two.  think of it from his point of view when you cbet this flop how many times have you got enough to defend against a c/r."
poker,3ci3fv,Terps10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:32:00 2015 UTC,"This was pretty much exactly my thinking. It really doesn't look like it hits my range, and a c/r makes sense. There are so many KQ, AJ, JT etc in my range that I HAVE to fold when he does this. This late in a tourney, with the CO/ SB dynamic, it's so rare that we both show up with overpairs. Anyway, I know I can't call so I do ship it in, and he calls with JJ."
poker,3ci3fv,Terps10,2,Wed Jul 8 14:06:23 2015 UTC,"This is a shove situation for me. This looks like standard big stack intimidation tactics on a board that misses your range late in a tournament, and I think you're good here more often than not. I'm a little surprised he flatted with JJ in the SB."
poker,3cidb1,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"There are actually not a lot of missed draws. JT made it and a lot of Ax may have paired their x. You have 4th pair which beats only a complete bluff. It's reasonable to 2x float V, but I think he has it when he bets river. I like bluff raising the flop here. I would rather fold all his Kx/Qx/SC hands rather than call down all the way. Sometimes he makes it with his bluffs. Don't like the float OOP. On turn, I like the idea of putting pressure on his TPGK and random 2p hands. We x/r turn and shove river. We beat a lot of non-bluffs and I think we can get value from those."
poker,3cidb1,withoutatrace123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"It's reasonable to 2x float V, but I think he has it when he bets river.   He's so far bet every river when he's barrelled turn, if I'm calling turn I shouldn't be folding river when it completes no draws he could be semibluffing.   We beat a lot of non-bluffs and I think we can get value from those.     Not against this villain, he has yet to bet with any 1 pair or 2 pair hand and make it to showdown.   Raising flop in hand 2 sounds like it's better though, since I basically always win the pot assuming he doesn't go crazy, and he's usually making a mistake by folding there."

poker,3cidb1,duskhat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"JT and QJ got there. Also KJ and AJ got there as well. The J hits the range of a lot of 2x barrel hands V plays. My point is that the J is not a complete blank. There aren't a whole lot of semi-bluffs who didn't make it except maybe Axcc, but that was a backdoor draw to begin with. If your read is correct, x/c could be a good play assuming villain is just incredibly bluffy, but a complete nit when it comes to calling a raise. Note however, since this is BvB you could be playing a wide range of hands, which gives him incentive to call you down light. Based on board runout you can never get stacks in and are basically forced to x/c river. When I get a set I play for stacks. If he makes runner/runner clubs, sucks to be me."
poker,3cidb1,miles5555,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:14:08 2015 UTC,"H1 seems fine although I expect to see 2-pair a decent amount. Also given that this is 3-handed in a 6-max game we could 3b bluff K6o pre (Villain will be folding way too much)   H2 interesting that he used the exact same sizing. Also turn and river are both about 71% so it's like a reg on auto-pilot. It's unlikely he bets most weak Ax for value so calling down is probably okay given his bluffing range is huge  H3 not a fan of floating flop, river is gross and Villain doesn't have a ton of 2-pair combos or bluffs that missed and will barrel river. We have near the top of our range though so prob a call in-game and a fold when we think about it, haha. Also x/r turn for value would be good. If we're 3b prob GII"

poker,3ch1gr,timetosuckit,8,Tue Jul 7 21:11:12 2015 UTC,"If you were going to fold the turn I wouldn't even have raised the flop. QQ as a bluff doesn't make sense, since nothing better than your hand ever folds there, and it doesn't make sense as a value bet if you plan to fold to a 1/3 pot bet on the turn. I think almost anyone would have 3bet or 4bet KK or AA preflop, so I am fine more or less discounting those hands from his range. 22 or 44 are possible, but I feel like you're good enough of the time to get it in here especially given the preflop action which I think folds out a lot of small pairs. If you think he's the kind of player to stack off any overpair like 88-JJ (which I think he could have easily played that way preflop), then there are far more combos of those hands than 22, 44, or 77. I would call this turn and call or bet river.  The real mistake in this hand was on the flop. Either call with intentions of playing a medium-sized pot or raise with intentions of playing stacks. Folding flop or raising then folding turn are never good plays.  By the way, if he has you covered by $300, the stats at the top of your post are incorrect."
poker,3ch1gr,Ohrami,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:27 2015 UTC,Yeah if you raise flop you should be playing it for value. So folding turn is out of the question with 1/3 pot bet.   Do you think calling flop is a better play then?
poker,3ch1gr,Spewymcgewy,2,Tue Jul 7 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"I think raising flop is just fine in this situation if you think villain is continuing with a lot of second best, and in this particular situation I think 88-JJ will continue a lot, and I think he doesn't show up with a lot of stuff that beats you here. So yes, I think your line was fine until you folded the turn."
poker,3ch1gr,Ohrami,0,Tue Jul 7 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think folding the turn means the raise on the flop was for value. Another card came and there was new action (villain lead). All the pairs smaller that QQ (that didn't flop a set) could be continuing on the flop but then not leading the turn like this.   I'd raise larger pre tho, like 175-200 range. Also I prolly would call-call turn and river cuz I hate folding."
poker,3ch1gr,SarcasticStaredown,2,Wed Jul 8 03:09:05 2015 UTC,"The card that came is pretty much a brick, and I'd argue that it's actually a good card for us, since it decreases the number of hands that villain could reasonably have that beat us (unless he for some reason plays 87s or 76s this way). Also, the villain leading isn't anything new; he led the flop as well, and his flop bet was larger relative to the pot on the flop than on the turn.  If we're not raising the flop for value, then what are we raising the flop for? I can't see how we could turn QQ into a bluff on that flop, because like I said, anything ahead of us will never ever fold."
poker,3ch1gr,Ohrami,0,Wed Jul 8 03:19:33 2015 UTC,Let me just address the second part...  Just because nothing better folds on flop doesn't make our raise a bluff. We're assuming all the worse pairs will call also.

poker,3ch1gr,Spewymcgewy,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:11 2015 UTC,His lead is odd but I'd call turn with the intention of calling a lot of rivers.   That lead sets up for a pot sized bet on the river though so I'm kinda worried he's just all value hands here. Maybe he over values JJ and TT though. Depends upon specific read I suppose so maybe against unknowns you can fold.   ..tough spot.
poker,3ch1gr,Ohrami,2,Tue Jul 7 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can say he's always going to pot rivers considering his turn bet is only 1/3. Usually when villains bet small they do it on later streets as well, and he only bet a little less than half pot on the flop too. I also think his line looks a lot like JJ or TT considering the flatting preflop and the small bets on every street."
poker,3ch1gr,decalotus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt he leads with TT JJ after Hero raises his bet and the board pairing on turn. Most showdown value hands like that check turns.   That said, I agree you're right about calling the bet and calling most rivers."
poker,3ch1gr,miles5555,3,Tue Jul 7 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"You are deep. After calling pre, V donks a dry 7-high board into a 3bettor. Who does that? I wouldn't raise the flop.

poker,3ch1gr,withoutatrace123,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt V is ever playing A7s or 87s/76s here. By calling the flop raise OOP, he pretty much is restricted to sets and overpairs. The turn is good because it reduces the number of sets V could be holding. V range is absolutely capped by preflop raising: he never call/call with AA/KK in this situation.  Let's assign a range of 77+, 44, 22 to villain. Against that range we have more than enough equity to stack off. Even if he would play 87s/76s, we are still strong enough to stack off. In addition, I don't believe V always plays 44/22 in this situation, because he's not getting the best odds to set-mine preflop."

poker,3ch1gr,Joovie88,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"Pre: Fine.  I'd raise a little larger, like ~$170-$180, but doesn't really make that much of a difference.    Flop: I think your flop raise is what puts you in a weird spot.  This is a super dry flop, and there are hardly any cards on the turn that you are scare of.  I think he could be bluffing, but most likely he has a medium strength hand.  The issue is what does his range look like after you 3bet pre, then raise flop?  There are no bluffs left.  There are a few 7x that can't fold TP, some over pairs obv, maybe 1 combo 53, and sets.    As some people mentioned, you're ahead of his range right now, but you have some inverse implied odds.  If you end up GII, you're probably going to be behind to everything except the occasional JJ.   I think you call the donk bet, pot control for now, and either call or raise turn.    Turn: As played, weird spot.  I probably end up going call/call on like every river.  Or call/bet on ""safe"" rivers.    Overall: I think we call flop.  Then I would bet/raise 2/3 pot on any non A/K turn.  I'm probably looking to get river value, but not GII."

poker,3ch1gr,Ethicallyunethical,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"This is a tough spot for sure.  In live poker, I'm leaning towards folding bc this line is usually a set.  When he leads, and then calls your raise after you've ALREADY 3B pre, he is weighted toward sets as V's 88+ can easily fold to your flop raise sizing.  Same with his 7Xss hands, they can and often time will fold to your flop raise.  But by flatting the flop and leading the turn he is guaranteeing himself that you can never X behind OTT.  His bet sizing is also a sizing that screams CALL ME vs your AA/KK/QQ/JJ  The only hands that V could have that you can beat is JJ-88, and if V is a reg, and you are a thinking player, he would be committing SPR River suicide playing TT vs your 3b + flop raise range."

If he has a boat or quads would he really be leading out the turn to a player who has shown aggression every street? If I have 77 here I'm check/calling the turn and planning a shove on the river. Same with 44 and 22.   He might put you on AK or even a hand like QQ and thinks you might fold to the second 7. You have to continue the hand here and not fold.
poker,3ch1gr,bradswilson,0,Wed Jul 8 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"Flop's perfectly fine ... villain can level himself because he did a weird small donk bet and call with much worse.  Turn initially feels like an obvious call but it is somewhat weird to donk again. He knows it's hard to rep the 7 and if he had like 88-JJ, he should let you continue the bluff he ""induced"" on the flop.

poker,3ch1lq,withoutatrace123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"I would actually bet this turn for two reasons: 1. its probably still the best hand 2. it gives you control of the hand on the river (unless he leads into you or raises you)  If he raises you on the turn, I think its kind of sick but its a fold.  you have QQ for straight draw blockers and he probably wouldn't raise this board with a draw that he wouldnt raise with on the flop.  If he leads into you on the river its probably a fold, as its really strong if they just check/call check/call bet.    The point is is that you can have a solid plan and control of the pot if you bet the turn, whereas if you just check the river, you give him a chance to bluff with like a potsized bet and put you in a spot tougher than any of the ones above."
poker,3ch1lq,RunChan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"I love a bet on the turn here - I actually think it's a really good merge. A lot of people will expect you to check back everything with decent-but-not-amazing showdown value, so a bet looks like either a bluff or the nuts. This means you are very unlikely to get check raised here. If you do, like you said it's a fold.   But lots of villains made weaker hands (lots of Jacks and tens) will call as bluff catchers and check the river, and you can check back and frequently win. Once you bet the turn you're likely to get to showdown with no more betting.  As played imo river is a fold - def not a raise but imo not even a call. There aren't a huge number of bluffs that make sense here and most of villains hands with just a jack or just a ten, or even 88's and  99's, are c/c-ing river, not leading out."

It also gives you information because your opponent calls only with a K or better. x/c flop and x/re-eval turn. This line keeps your opponents' bluffs in. If he is a maniac who barrels off on turns and rivers you can call him down. Otherwise at 2 NL if he fires off a second barrel, I would just give up and fold the jacks. If he x back turn most likely he's raising the white flag or has a weak showdown value hand like Tx/99/88, so you should b/f the river."

poker,3ciupr,KerryK,-1,Wed Jul 8 07:06:01 2015 UTC,"your 3bet pre is fine mabe would make it 18 or 20 just for the sake of nicer rounded numbers and thats not gonna stop him from calling and you get a bit mor emoney in the pot. he called your 3 bet and with a vpip of 25 hes not a very spewy player preflop i imagine, so you could safely assume hes not calling or continuing on this flop with nothing, although it is possible. because he has position you could maybe call this flop if you know he is cbetting 100% of the time other then that he could easily have a k and if your not comfortable with your postflop skills i think a fold here is best. no need to try and bluff him off and at 2nl its best to play fit or fold just to get out of that horrible player pool"

poker,3cffdh,bigsillyboy,10,Tue Jul 7 19:15:42 2015 UTC,You sound pretty dedicated to a series of tournaments with a <$5 average buy in.
poker,3cffdh,RudolfKGB,6,Tue Jul 7 19:48:45 2015 UTC,Usually play $11-$55 range with occasional Sunday bigs but this series is very good value should you get a top 10 finish with the added Sunday milly packages. Plus if you get top 100 you're usually making profit anyway across the series so it's win/win.

poker,3cgwyz,cobwebscavern,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:13:37 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty much like some of my home games - I adjust my game by playing along with the pre limping and seeing a ton of flops but then being pretty aggresive post flop to thin the field but also happy to fold when someone else hits the flop hard.   I usually find that normal bets at such small levels compared to starting stacks get zero respect so raise big early with any primo hands to make sure you do thin out the herd and get a better chance of them holding up while still getting value.
poker,3cgwyz,IAmArag0rn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"the deeper you are, the more intrinsic value hands that can draw to nuts (suited Axs, suited connectors etc). will have .on the other side of the coin, the deeper you are your bigger pairs will have less value since you will have a tougher time playing for stacks and building the pot vs anyone with a brain."

poker,3cf5cs,jkugelman,18,Tue Jul 7 12:52:12 2015 UTC,"Brag: I made Day 2 of the main with 84k in chips - top 10%. I'm excited. This is my first time playing and it was such a blast. I like the two hour levels a lot. I thought they'd be a drag going in, but actually they give you so much time. I just treaded water for the first six hours. It was pretty stressful. After dinner things finally starting going my way.  The guy on my left was a complete and utter maniac. He raised 2 out of 3 hands, nonstop, for two hours. It was very frustrating to not be able to pick him off. My cards were so bad and he never folded. The best hand was at 150/300: he limps 300 UTG. Raise to 1100 from MP and reraise to 3300 from the SB. LAGfish calls the 3300. MP makes it 9900. This is the first 4-bet all day. SB tanks and folds (QQ, he revealed later). Maniac calls the 9900 for 40% of his stack, then check/folds the flop to a small bet.  For some reason everyone at the table cheered when this guy busted. I guess they didn't like money.  Had a couple people who would 5x or even 10x it preflop. The 10x-er triumphantly showed AA when everyone folded. Poker is dead, folks.  Overall my table was incredibly soft. Very loose, pretty straightforward players all around. The long levels were really nice because even though I lost 100BB in the first level I knew I should stay patient and not panic. When I finally got cards I made some outrageously large value bets that got paid off. I overbet the river twice against a guy who wasn't that bad, but I knew just didn't pay attention to bet sizing.  Beat: Ole Schemion's at my table tomorrow."

Make sure you have some time to actually dedicate to watching videos though. It is only $9.99/month, so it's not like it's breaking the bank (for most of us).    That being said, you can probably find enough free information if you're only at something like 2NL. the RIO subscription would start helping much more at 10NL+, but I would still recommend at any point if you have the time.    TL;DR - Yes"

Whose an old man coffee, LAG, etc. most will be loose passive limpers, and to be honest, you should be doing a lot of over-limping in LP with your marginal hands. There's just no point in raising KTs in the CO when 6 people are going to call. Much better to see the flops, make your hands, bet your draws as they will still call. An aggressive style can still work, just don't go nuts, as people call 10x pre with some fucked up holdings a lot of the time. But Ya, watching the table for the first bit also gives you a tight image from the get go which should help when you start playing a bit laggier until/if they catch on."

poker,3cf5cs,Kuumakarhu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:07:21 2015 UTC,About to play live 100nl for the very first time in my life. Is 10% rake with a cap of 6€ beatable? also no rake if no flop seen.
poker,3cf5cs,MrMogz,3,Tue Jul 7 14:13:13 2015 UTC,That's pretty high rake IMO. I'm sure it's 'beatable' but not a game I would want to play.
poker,3cf5cs,Kuumakarhu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:28:02 2015 UTC,I see. As a student don't have the roll for 1/2 so no other options really.

poker,3cf5cs,sound311system,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:16 2015 UTC,Of the 2 casinos around me (Connecticut)....only one offers a 1/1 and it is the same rake as the 1-2 ($5 max with $1 for high hand jackpot)...it's a big rake for such a small game. You don't see too many actual players playing....good place to donk around and get some drinks if that's what your goal for the night is.
poker,3cf5cs,CleverFreddie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:58:13 2015 UTC,What's a standard rake?
poker,3cf5cs,MrMogz,5,Tue Jul 7 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly what /u/clarityy said, 5% at $5 cap makes for games that you can beat without fighting the rake. And I've never played anywhere that has the pay per 30/60 minute intervals. Fuck that noise."
poker,3cf5cs,Clarityy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"depends on where you are. But a nice amount of rake tends to be 5%, $5 cap"
poker,3cf5cs,BadFrog1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:20:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely seems high. At the casinos I've played in, the cap is $5 (plus $1 for bad beat) at 1-2, so you're basically paying double.  But, given how terrible players are at 1-2, I'd assume .5-1€ is crazy soft."

poker,3cfqgn,zippoplease1,4,Tue Jul 7 15:46:16 2015 UTC,There is absolutely no chance you're ahead here. Just muck and pat yourself on the back once the SB called and tabled the winner.
poker,3cfqgn,SvenKramer123,2,Tue Jul 7 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Fold flop, you're rarely ahead. When SB pots it he's showing up with QQ+, sets and sometimes he has AK barrelling off because he had a good starting hand. BB is probably sticking it in with sets, 99, AT, KTs, once in a while he shows up with AA/KK. Fold turn, he's continued betting into a dry side pot, he's never doing this with AT which is the hand one pip weaker than yours and you've got about 10% equity to improve."
poker,3cfqgn,RudolfKGB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"87s, overpairs, TT depending what stats hes running. He is never potting it here without overpair, set or 2pair on the flop. Only hand you realistically beat is AK, AQ, AJ and Ts- not many of his T's 3bet pre against utg and none of the overs is potting against 2 players. Just fold... Only thing that makes it interesting is the fact SB is only calling flop behind and not just putting you AI right there when you have like 1/4 pot left..."
poker,3cfqgn,Jarggo,0,Wed Jul 8 11:18:23 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, there's a few lines we can take here:  Line 1:  Assuming I play preflop the same, flop is an easy fold after it goes pot sized bet and a call; we're just not good here.  Line 2:  Usually I would also flat the 3 bet here, but we need to take note of some things. The fact the BB cold called gives us more incentive to 4 bet here. I think I would 4 bet to like $1.40 or so and take it from there."
poker,3cfqgn,AcesFullOnly,0,Tue Jul 7 18:04:37 2015 UTC,"I would have angrily folded on the flop. Sure, you get mad if someone shows AT and the other has 99. But, I've got to believe someone putting all that money in has a set or AA/KK."
poker,3cfqgn,bulldg4life,0,Tue Jul 7 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"BB doesn't seem like a great player. He cold called pre and is shortstacking, so he could easily be raising top pair or even 99 in this situation. SB is deep and 3-bet pre, so I assume he's fairly competent. Most people's 3-bet range from the blinds is pretty value heavy at 5NL (like JJ+, AK). When SB goes pot OTF against 2 players OOP, we're looking at a chop in the best case scenario, so it's a clear fold."
poker,3cfqgn,withoutatrace123,-4,Tue Jul 7 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"Pre-flop:    SB 4bets to isolate, I'm putting him on A2-A9s, 55-99, AQo+ When BB calls, I'm putting him on the same, plus 10s   Post flop   SB is repping either a set or QQ+ at this point, and BB is repping a set or most likely KK+. I would snap fold as you're most likely not ahead at this point.  You're looking at 3.5:1 pot odds and at best 5:1 on implied odds of hitting a gut shot or trips to beat out a higher pair or set. I need 7:1 implied odds to go ahead with a gut shot & 6 outs when I'm behind to make it worth it.    Turn:    save the 47BB and fold. SB range is polarized on a set at this point, most likely 10s. 6 outs and 5.9:1 pot and implied odds at this point. Fold it like an origami crane"

This is the only activity I have ever seen where a slightly above average guy has a sponsorship.  Nothing else is like this.  I'm not saying it's bad.  It just seems strange.  Usually a sponsored pro is someone that has made it huge in his field and is someone you aspire to be based on what he has accomplished.  Jamie is not that.

poker,3cchyh,PokerDividends,6,Tue Jul 7 06:56:09 2015 UTC,the criteria for being a pokerstars pro isn't determined by your skill level. it is all about marketability and the ability for you to recruit new people. it is about being a +EV investment for pokerstars.
poker,3cchyh,BornIn1500,-2,Mon Jul 6 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"Jamie has already basically told his twitch viewers what he makes yearly.  It's well under $100,000, and probably closer to 50k.  So ok, that makes him above average.  It's still far from someone I would consider a top tier pro.   you are prob not a winner so that is why you might think he is average   The hell does that even mean?  That makes no sense whatsoever."
poker,3cchyh,PokerDividends,3,Mon Jul 6 21:58:25 2015 UTC,I edited that last part out because I think it is offensive to beginners. My bad.  Pokerstars doesn't care what you consider a top tier pro. The criteria they use to determine being a pokerstars 'pro' is similiar to what investors use. Jamie brings in new people and is popular on twitch. How can you not see that? maybe you should try some reading comprehension.
poker,3cchyh,BornIn1500,-3,Mon Jul 6 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"Pokerstars doesn't care what you consider a top tier pro   I'm a potential customer whenever they decide to come to the states.  To say they don't care is flat-out wrong. It's just that they obviously think that personality outweighs playing ability and that customers like me are in the minority.  Personally, I'd be more swayed to see a guy raking in 5 mil a year over a dude making 50k a year with a good personality."

poker,3chzmj,lizzuma,2,Wed Jul 8 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"I know, I had to use some of the tournament winnings to pay for important stuff, so all that was left was 900. I know playing a lot of hands is more important for improving than anything else, but I'll look up 'Harrington'.   I'm ok, I've cashed 2 tournaments this year for about 2,800, but I've not won more than 50 bucks in a cash game. I don't mind losing as much as long as I realize why I lost. This time it was because I didn't believe an old guy when he had it, and I slow played AA on a dry board, he made trips on the turn. So now I know older players tend to not bluff as much, especially if they're only playing like 5 hands over an hour. Also, never ever slow play AA or sets.   What sized roll do you think I need to play 1-2 with 300 max BI?"
poker,3chzmj,Stevenab87,3,Wed Jul 8 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what your bankroll is for playing the smallest stakes. 1/2 is the lowest live game you can play, so you can play with whatever you can afford to lose. Ideally, you would want to have at least 20 BI for the level of stakes you are playing in order to handle variance."

Yes, it would be ""ideal"" if you had 20 buy ins ($4,000 - $6,000) handy, but that's certainly not a requirement. Just budget whatever amount you can comfortably afford to lose.

poker,3chzmj,FoldPreflop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:07 2015 UTC,Deep stack cash and tournies are two completely different animals. Small ball doesn't work in cash games.    The rake kills you if you play too many hands. Small ball works because you are threatening stack-wipe elimination with your escalating bets while avoiding elimination yourself. Elimination doesn't matter in cash games. People are more likely to float when they have 5x pot behind and can rebuy vs a tourny where they have 2x the pot behind and the next bet threatens elimination.

poker,3cebvb,thehan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:04:06 2015 UTC,"Hi Jaime Your analysis seems great and I like that you're thinking outside the box. I have a tough time doing this in soft fields as my default thinking is ""do everything standard there's plenty of fish to hand you chips so just never get out of line"" (probably how the guys saying 'fold' with no reasoning are thinking). But it is certainly more profitable to really think through every spot in case something that doesn't make sense like this comes up.    The thing I'd like to ask you that you did not address in the video: Once you flat turn, what is your plan on the river? If an ace or king peels off and he shoves, what do you do? A non 8 club? Any other scare cards I'm missing? I think if we are ever really planning on folding river then it would just be best to shove turn. If our read is solid that we have best hand on turn then from a ""tournament life"" perspective we should just stick it in.   I am normally not an advocate of the Hellmuthian save tourney life at all costs strategy, but in the main event where you KNOW that you will probably find a great spot later, I think it's okay to sacrifice the really tiny +EV spots in order to ensure that you will find bigger +EV spots later, and you aren't eliminated now before you get to realize those spots. For those reasons, I shove the turn given your analysis (before seeing your analysis I prob muck turn without thought which is certainly a leak in my game, so thanks for this video).   Good luck on day 2!"

This means that any funds we keep on the site is at risk of being lost at any moment.

poker,3ceuh1,KernelsMustard,2,Tue Jul 7 17:18:14 2015 UTC,I think the main reason for showing cards live is to try and induce the villain into showing.

If I'm up against this type of player and I'm folding TP to their big turn bet then I don't mind occasionally showing my hand and complimenting them on their 2P or set.  Meanwhile, other players will take note and label you as a ""solid"" player, and instamuck to your next XR."
poker,3ceuh1,acekingdom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:42 2015 UTC,It's also kind of fun to show what you fold if you want some conversation to get started. Which in turn gets you a bit of information.

poker,3cfbqy,bulldg4life,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:16 2015 UTC,I get this a lot in micro-tournaments. Someone will shove all-in multiple times in a row (resulting in folds) and I'll call the when I get a hand like AQ. Half the time they end up actually having a hand this time.

poker,3cfbqy,DashCat9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:43:37 2015 UTC,Uurrggh..conflict here.  What can you do when someone is just raising/shoving any two cards? Wait for someone else to be the hero and take him on? Only play AA or KK against him? How much are you giving away here if that is the case and how wide is his range if he is playing every hand?   In a DYM the main strategy is to just outlast but letting one player bully then you are playing for 2 spots from 5 instead of 3 from 6 (or similar)...TBH I would have done the same and I think you are in a good spot the most of the time.   The only other option may have been a call....which I think is a delay tactic against a maniac and potentially a bad thing as you might be letting a poor hand that would have folded catch you on the flop.
poker,3cfbqy,Four_Months,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"I was playing in a quick tournament last night, and there was an all in for ~10bb, a call, and a person shoved for about 60bb.  The caller folds, and Mr. 60bb flips over A7s.   And loses the hand.  Very next hand, the guy who had call/folded before open raises about three times the blind, and Mr. 60bb (well....now about 50bb) shoves again.   Other guy thinks for a few seconds and calls with pocket 8's.  Mr. 50bb flips over 98o.  Flops a nine and it holds.  Killed the action at the table until I caught a monster against him and doubled up, then did it again and knocked him out.  Turns the poker table into a session of bingo."

If this was a 3 way pot with a standard open then sure, it makes sense to make draws pay on this flop, but this is heads up and a 3 bet pot. Vs range is way more Ax than a flush draw.   If V checked flop, how much would you have bet? Around 115 right? Or at least close to it. This is a dream scenario. Shoving isn't the worst thing in the world, but it eliminates all his bluffs, why not keep his bluffs in?"

There's no way you get credit for trips, so if V has an A he will pay you off. He may even pay you off with QQ if he thinks you're raising light.   I would minraise and hope he jams over your raise. It keeps the bluffs and Ax in his range and we can easily get the rest in OTT."

I normally play 1/2 and 1/3 and the players are far worse than those over at Parx. Parking is easy, a quick walk over to the poker tent and about 5 mins later you'll have a hand in front of you. There are a few temporary downsides to the room, namely having to walk outside and into the main casino to use the restroom is probably the biggest one. Floor staff is solid, dealer's are good.

poker,3cdqnm,RudolfKGB,3,Tue Jul 7 02:57:25 2015 UTC,Even if he has a draw he has massive equity vs your hand.   With the addition of a player behind it's a pretty trivial fold.
poker,3cdqnm,raspaz,3,Tue Jul 7 12:03:16 2015 UTC,"I'm never folding here. All Ax club draws, all open enders are raising here, KT, AT, JJ and QQ some of the time too. Yeah you're going to be behind a set or 2P some of the time and yeah you have like zero fold equity but you're still going broke here. Basically because MP is dead money, he's very unlikely to call your shove and thus giving you a bit better odds. Yeah it sucks a lot of the time because it's a thin +EV situation. But if you're folding big overpairs to re-raises here, you're folding too often."
poker,3cdqnm,Picture_me_this,3,Tue Jul 7 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"All Ax club draws, all open enders are raising here   Really? When we cbet into 3 players on this board texture that usually favors the preflop callers, we look really strong. What does our cbet range look like here? Villain is getting a great price to peel with a draw. There's a good chance a random 16NL villain isn't thinking about this and is just raising because they read somewhere to play draws aggressively, but I don't think folding is bad here at all. Also, MP is not always folding. MP could have called the cbet with a flush draw or combo draw and will overcall if we jam because he wants to get it in 3 ways with 30-35% equity. If the CO has a set or 2p and MP has a flush draw we are basically toast. Obviously this is worst case scenario, but after only investing 12bb I think we can fold to the flop raise. A lot of the semi-bluff flush draws are Axcc, which has ~40% equity against us. I can't use stove at work but I imagine against a range of Axcc, sets, T9, and a few other FD/OE combos we're not doing great."
poker,3cdqnm,Furples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:11:03 2015 UTC,"You're giving 16NL villains too much credit. He's looking at his hand and saying ""herp derp I have something, raise"". He's not thinking about how we look, what we're representing, what our range is. You wind up just leveling yourself into folding a big hand and loosing money. MP imo is flatting your cbet like 90% of the time with any two. Yes of course he could show up with the nuts here, but his range is the widest. Since there's dead money in the pot, we need like 40%+ to make it profitable."
poker,3cdqnm,Picture_me_this,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating 16NL on stars. It's not like 2NL AFAIK. I know 25NL is legitimately pretty tough to beat, so I imagine 16NL isn't much different. I don't think stacking off or calling turn to call a blank river is bad here, but off the top of my head I'd estimate we have around 30-35% equity against villains range. With this being said, my knowledge of the stars 16NL pool is limited"
poker,3cdqnm,Furples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"I play these stakes. It's fairly similar to 25NL, as you'd expect.   However, CO looks super bad. Obviously 12 hands is not a lot, but his stats are currently VPIP: 58.33, PFR: 25.00  Makes this a lot more difficult I think."

I watch a lot of training videos for 10NL through 25NL and it seems like most villains on stars have reggish stats and you can't just bet/fold every street with fat value hands and print money like you could in 2008. At least on stars, it seems like you need to have an idea of range construction at 25NL/50NL and can't just play exploitatively"
poker,3cdqnm,Picture_me_this,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"Dude you can play exploitatively to 200NL winning 3-5bb/100. Really people don't pay as much attention to how you play as you think. 25NL was the limit I struggled to most with too, I know your pain guys. I think I must have at least 400K hands at that limit. But once you realize how to exploit x-y-z situation you'll find the game ""makes sense"" where it didn't before. So yeah, don't ever fold an over pair to one raise."
poker,3cdqnm,Furples,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"I've played up to 200NL on bovada which was honestly pretty soft, but I know that 200NL on stars is tough as hell. There's no way you can play purely exploitatively without balanced ranges and win at 5bb/100h. I've seen enough graphs from RIO coaches at 200NL to know how tough it is. There are people on RIO who can use CardRunners EV to break down every little aspect of their range to balance against good regs who are probably barely making 5bb/100h. The game just isn't as easy as it used to be. Ask /u/cwlrs, he's a current 200NL reg rn AFAIK"

I don't know what I'd do with that hypothesis, not sure if I check call all the way down, or if I come back over the top and use my fold equity.

poker,3cdqnm,timetosuckit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:12:14 2015 UTC,"I understand your point.   is this a check call all the way down? (assuming 1 or 0 of the draws hit), if both draws hit (OESD and flush) probably fold right?  Thoughts?"
poker,3cdqnm,je-rock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"If he has nothing but combo draws, sets, and 2 pairs you are well behind that range.  Additionally, you don't improve very often especially given that when you make 2 pair you fare never sure that villain hasn't boated up giving you some negative implied odds that hurt your equity.   Additionally, you are out of position so when the turn comes you are probably checking all non-kings.  This allows villain to play pretty perfect.  They can check back their draws for the free river and bet their value hands.  If they do check back it is hard to value bet the river because you there shouldn't be many bare tens in villains range to call you and if villain was making this thin raise with QQ or JJ they should be trying to get it in on the turn because they think they are ahead of your flop calling range (why else would they make this bet unless they are really bad and also a lot of QQ and JJ combos should be removed from villains range because they would likely 3bet pre rather than go to a flop multi-way)   So to recap: We are probably behind villains range and we will have no opportunity to value bet later in the hand unless we hit a king (one of which completes the flush and both of which complete QJ so the vbet would still be ultra thin).  Lastly, there are literally no good cards in the deck for you other than non-club <6's.    I just don't see a lot of ways this hand plays out that give you clean value or easy decisions.  I'd muck."
poker,3cdqnm,timetosuckit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"wow. that was very insightful. I appreciate that. I think you make a lot of sense. The bottom line is, this is an extremely tough decision that falls on the side of folding.  The way you lay it out, I agree. It makes no sense that he would raise without a made hand, given the fact that there are three other players. HU maybe he semi-bluffs but not with three players."
poker,3cdqnm,je-rock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:45:26 2015 UTC,The real issue is that most of his semi-bluffs are big draws like nutt flush draws or flush + straight draws that have even or better equity against your kings.  So if you run even against the bottom of villains range you equity against the entire range isn't very good.

I feel like we can discard 10's as they're a bit too strong to be just set mining with, so 3B pf.

Mostly we are fucked, hope to be flipping, rarely crushing. I don't think we can ever call with 2 behind and 2 streets to go.

He's very likely to bust out, so I'd say his stack might be worth around $10k in his hands.  I think for $2500 you'd probably want about a 30% stake. That might be reasonable - though I doubt he'd accept it!  In conclusion, don't buy into him. Just let him at it, and wish him luck."

poker,3cgpoo,Clarityy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:51:23 2015 UTC,Yes I had heard $20 per hour playing live 1-2 was pushing the max.

Live is much softer, however it's way less volume (40-45 hands an hour if you're lucky) and you're asking if a 120bb/100 winrate is sustainable.  You've played 30 hours, so you've played about 1200-1600 hands.  No, it's not even close to sustainable, you're just on a massive heater."

I know I'm not a good player, as I have not been studying the game for very long, and I have a lot of dumb questions to ask as I continue to learn.

At first glance I hated the huge overshove but I think it's actually fine. Maybe we should play it a bit slower due to our kicker.... Actually nvm it's btn vs bb.

poker,3ccnhf,withoutatrace123,2,Mon Jul 6 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"Hand 1. After the turn, you have a big combo draw but the TT is very vulnerable to higher pairs and the straight draw is vulnerable to the flush draw.  JJ-AA is a big part of his mergey preflop OOP 3bet range so your overpair is way behind these hands. The big club draws in his double barrel bluff range like AKcc, AQcc, AJcc, KQcc, QJcc  are about 25% and don't mind a shove (28 to win 76), so that can't be right. You could call but these big club draws have 11 to 14 outs against you, and he can bluff every river Q-A that misses him and you have to fold. You are probably getting the right price to call the turn (how much else is in his double barrel range besides the bigger pairs and the big club draws?) but it's a very iffy spot. Your best hope is that it goes c/c on the river (or you hit your six out straight)."
poker,3ccnhf,Heisenb3rg88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"H1: Super standard call, call, decide. Probably fold given blockers. Turn jam accomplishes nothing, no better hand folds. Against v aggro players you could also make a case for 4b/calling pre.  H2: I prefer a smaller bet on the flop with range. Turn sizing is a bit big too. You've gotta think you're pretty fucked against a turn minraise. Your best options are probably to call them call blank rivers or just fold. Turn jam is suicidal  H3: Same story about turn minraises. Readless I'd call-call.  H4: Wp, disagree with cwlrs about turn fold, especially with equity against two pair. Otr AA and AJ are probably your best calling hands.  H5: Just fold turn, not many good rivers and the population is very value heavy here. (Didn't see note - in that case call down makes sense)"

H2 - Agreed turn jam is never really a winning move, can we call fold river to a brick? What rivers are we looking for to call?  H4  - I think folding turn is marginally better than calling and folding brick rivers, and having the Ks doesn't help, as there aren't too many 2p combos.

poker,3cdrw3,Furples,5,Tue Jul 7 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"No, I understand. At least from your post I can gleam that it is okay to fold these hands pre-flop from certain positions/stack depths, which in itself is somewhat of an answer for me."
poker,3cdrw3,Furples,6,Tue Jul 7 03:38:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If it folds to you on the button, then KQo is a slam dunk open. If you're UTG 9-handed, then opening A8o would be lighting money on fire. Position is most important, and table dynamics are also important (you can open wider if there are fish in the blinds). Stack sizes are also important because hands like KQo go up in value the shorter the stacks are"
poker,3cdrw3,Furples,4,Tue Jul 7 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"That is super good info! Thank you.  If it's easy and you don't mind, would you mind explaining why those types of hands go up in value with shorter stack sizes? If it's a complicated answer no worries, I was just wondering. I'm starting to read some books and more online resources to help me learn, so I'm sure I will come across this concept there at some point."
poker,3cdrw3,Ohrami,11,Tue Jul 7 04:04:44 2015 UTC,"In general, hands with great implied odds that can makes straights and flushes like 55 or 89s go up in value when stacks are really deep. This is because you have the potential to make a huge hand and win a big pot. But when you're 30bb deep, hands like KQo are much better than 87s. This is because you don't have a lot of room to maneuver post-flop so you're really looking just to hit top pair and stack off. So when you open the button and a 40bb stack 3bets you, 87s is a snap fold. But when you open the button and a 400bb stack 3bets you, you can easily call because you have the potential to win a big pot against their AA/KK/AK when the board runs out A6592. It's great to see as a beginner you're asking good questions - you have the right attitude to learn quickly and succeed so good luck!"
poker,3cdrw3,iamt1dal,2,Tue Jul 7 04:27:07 2015 UTC,Ahhhh that info is really helpful but your last line is even more encouraging. Cheers!
poker,3cdrw3,PaulAJK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"I would say at 2NL a hand like KQ would be a great open even from UTG at full ring, just because I'm assuming that most people at those buy-ins are extremely loose/passive/fishy. A8o, though, is a bit of a different story. KQ is the kind of hand you can easily stack a fish with simply due to the fact that you will catch top pair with a good kicker a lot of the time (which is usually good all in against that player type), where A8 won't give you a good kicker and even vs a fish I won't feel too comfortable stacking top pair with it.  With KQ at 2NL I'd probably open for something like $.10 even UTG expecting that I'll get called by a lot of dominated hands like QJ, KJ, KT, K9, even junk like K2 or Q4 which they plan to stack off with if they catch their top card. Of course, if you have thinking players at your table (which is rare at this buy-in), then you're going to fare worse opening KQ UTG. It mainly depends on the player type.  Getting 3bet in this spot is a bit tricky, but again it depends on the player type. If you're playing against an extremely passive calling station type fish who never shows aggression, it'd probably good to just fold right there. If you're playing against a maniac donk who raises every hand, 4bet or flat would be your best choices. I'd say I would feel very comfortable in a 3bet situation against almost anyone I see at 2NL, but still pay close attention to your HUD stats and take good notes to make the optimal play.  Good video on how to play KQ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maj9DP_kgYU  More stuff about weak ace hands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrRLjjIThVc"

poker,3cdrw3,Ohrami,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:55:22 2015 UTC,"Raising KQ 5X UTG in a full ring game is -EV almost anywhere. I don't know about Bovada, but if you do that on Pokerstars you'll bleed money. Very few players at 2NL will stack off with KJ or KT on a K high board, but many will be happy to do so with AK or sets."
poker,3cdrw3,Furples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:25:16 2015 UTC,"Since I'm USA I can't speak about PokerStars but on Bovada at 5NL I would be surprised not to see someone stack off top pair, especially with a 10 or Jack kicker. I see people playing stacks with 33 in 4 SPR pots when they didn't catch a set, and I see people trying to get it in preflop with 98s or worse at least a few times per hour. Maybe Bovada has far more stupid players; like I said, if the players have any thinking ability, KQ becomes a much weaker hand from early position, but at 5NL on Bovada I generally assume players are weak, passive fish until they prove otherwise."
poker,3cdrw3,Rimmoruud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"I wish I could play Bovada. On PK even 1-2 is infested with eastern European or Latin American regs who tend to avoid these sort of moves. Happy hunting, and I think it's time to shift my micro BR to eaiser grounds."
poker,3cdrw3,JMY_3118,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:12:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck, just got all in preflop with KK vs A5o after 10 minutes of playing. I also got a guy to call a 7bet preflop with A8s (still lost the hand)"
poker,3cdrw3,Dmayyy,2,Tue Jul 7 23:43:33 2015 UTC,"One more question. If it doesn't fully ""fold to me"" when I'm on the button with KQo, say one ore two people limp, is it still okay to open? I know table dynamics play a part but let's just say on the average table at 2 NL.  Also, am I correct in assuming the term ""open"" = raise to 2 or 3 BBs?"
poker,3cdrw3,TravisPM,3,Tue Jul 7 13:40:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, generally your open sizes are going to be ~3bb. When somebody limps at 2NL, you should actually be more inclined to open KQo. When one or multiple people limp you should generally open a little bigger to around ~4-5 BB, because you don't want to give people behind you great odds to call. The great thing about opening KQo after limping is that the limpers will often have hands like K7o/QTo/89o. Which means that you crush their range, often have them dominated, AND get to play against them in position. This is why limp/calling is such a weak play. If somebody limps from MP and you raise to 4bb with KQo on the button (this is called an isolation raise) and the flop comes K94r, you can usually bet 3 streets comfortable against loose-passive villains and win a huge pot against hands like KT or K7"

poker,3cdrw3,jkugelman,2,Tue Jul 7 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"The hand in front of you is less important than 1) the players at your table and 2) your position. I will fold AJ KQ utg no problem if I have an aggressive table and then I will play k2o on the button on a weak table. Really try to focus on those 2 things and hands will come naturally. Get in the habit of folding A rags, it's a bad habit for most new players and it will get you into big trouble."
poker,3cdrw3,Rimmoruud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:46:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the knowledge!
poker,3cdrw3,RinnyFlamboyant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:35:47 2015 UTC,Great advice.  The only time I ever play A rags is shorthanded or short stacked in a tournament.  Sometimes I'll raise on the button to limpers but you can do that with any hand.
poker,3cdrw3,The-Doctor-94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:17:55 2015 UTC,Depends on your position mostly. You're probably fine folding A8/A9 and other shitty aces anywhere other than the button and opening from the SB. KQo/KJs I'd open from MP but maybe fold in EP. I don't play full ring but for 6max I would open KJ/KQ almost always UTG which is MP1 in full ring I believe so it's pretty much the same position.
poker,3cdrw3,PokerJunkieKK,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"So you're saying from the button or from SB I should be raising with these hands, assuming everybody else limped/folded pre-flop?"
poker,3cdrw3,Rimmoruud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"If it's folded to you then yes. Usually I'd dump weak aces against limpers unless I'm isolating a complete fish because there's basically 3 outs to make top pair and that's it. KQ/KJ I'm happily raising to isolate any limper in late position because those hands have some connectivity to make straights as well as top pair hands.  I just complete usually in the SB with speculative hands like KQ/KJ facing a bunch of limpers though, you never pick up the pot preflop and are generally just playing a bigger pot out of position. I'm not sure if that's correct but it seems like it would save me money from raising and just giving up postflop after I miss."
poker,3cdrw3,Rimmoruud,2,Tue Jul 7 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice, it really does help."
poker,3cdrw3,shittyartist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"A8 suited (unsuited too, on some Boards) is a good blind defence, I would say. If someone does a small raise (2-4 blinds) you can play it with good enough odds, alldoe you still have to be carefull if you hit an ace"
poker,3cdrw3,Dmayyy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:46:39 2015 UTC,"That's thing like even if I hit an ace I'm scared to commit a lot of my stack to the pot, because if they are raising preflop I feel like there is a huge probability they have a stronger ace..  So I find myself just wanting to dump it preflop."
poker,3cdrw3,spicygobby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:40:18 2015 UTC,And that's fine. You'll get more comfortable with post flop play as time goes on. Folding marginal hands preflop is perfectly fine when starting out.  Keep in mind that most pots are not huge. Nothing says if you call pre and flop top pair that you have to put three bets in post flop. You could decide to put just one bet in and fold to a second barrel.
poker,3cdrw3,spicygobby,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:12:43 2015 UTC,This is really helpful for my mentality. Thanks so much!
poker,3cdrw3,Gnarzz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"The thing you have to think is, that when an ace hits, it lowers the probability of him having one. If you are the aggressive raiser preflop, you have to keep ut up! Easier to bluff eventuelly too, and in that case he might have folded. And by betting you have an easier time putting him om a hand. Another thing is, when you play a pot with a hand, you have to be aggressive, no matter if you are a Lag og Tag!"

Or raising I might get UTG to toss AK JJ and possible queens if he has the other half IE he calls I know its probably not AA or KK. However, I am not that tricky and not confident post flop to play that way like if 2 8 7 rainbow comes off, what the hell do I do then? Positions I don't want to be in!"
poker,3cdan3,withoutatrace123,3,Tue Jul 7 01:00:22 2015 UTC,"An open raise UTG has a much wider range.   A LAG SB trying to push you o ut of the pot.    So, let's go through this:  1.5 SB in the pot UTG makes it 5BB SB raises the pot, so its 11 BB to you  So, 16 BB in the pot.    With QQ here vs a UTG open raiser.  Assuming UTG has KK/AA/AK is probably pretty false.  UTG could have a wide raise.  I'd probably re-raise the SB try to edge out the UTG raiser.  If he goes all in after a raise, re-raise, then you're out 20-25 BB.    If he folds you are heads up against SB who likely is 3 betting light (any mid pair, any decent ace)"

poker,3cdan3,RudolfKGB,2,Wed Jul 8 22:48:43 2015 UTC,"UTG is unlikely to give you action except with QQ+/AK and he will be pushing 100% of the time he does give action, since a cold 4-bet is repping really strong. I also don't like calling the reraise if UTG is aggressive enough to squeeze. Therefore, there's no option except to fold. However, I would probably stack off with QQ if the open had come from the HJ/CO/BTN instead of UTG."
poker,3cdan3,Touch_Of_Red,2,Tue Jul 7 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't know what to do: you should usually fold  I would suggest that not many players are tight enough to look down at 99 or TT or AQ etc  and just open fold it, so the fact you have only seen him play 4 hands is likely a sample size issue.  As for this exact spot stack depths are what matter and the frequency of 3 bets at the table. Some live games play so passive that folding queens here is correct."
poker,3cdan3,CleverFreddie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:17:02 2015 UTC,"I like this view of the hand a lot. Essentially, I was worried about UTG image. Tight player, very tight player. I don't think he's open fold pocket pairs, but I also don't think he's raising anything less than JJ or 10 10. This hand is really bothering me, because I think I could of played it better, but I could stacked off here pretty easy too with subpar holdings."
poker,3cdan3,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"I could find a fold here. It sucks when a LAG 3bets it when they're doing it with like 15-20% of hands but UTG is still going to be opening relatively tight and you're pretty committed if you 4bet or call, if you get action you're rarely ahead. I probably fold QQ way too often though, apparently I muck it 7.4% of the time preflop."
poker,3cdan3,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:46:06 2015 UTC,UTG would never open raise light. I kind of thought that SB might have my outs in his loose 3 bet range IE KQ OJ suited all 3 bet hands for him.
poker,3cdan3,JMY_3118,3,Tue Jul 7 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends if your LAG friend is aware of UTG's TAG play style and adjusting his 3betting range accordingly as well, as in not 3betting JTs when he rarely gets folds and often gets 4bet. If he's adjusting I think it's a pretty easy fold tbh, his 3bet range probably wouldn't even include JJ/AJ or maybe even AQ so you'd usually be flipping or crushed if you did come in. If he's just 3betting because he has a pretty hand then I hate life a bit and wait for a better spot rather than putting my stack in on something pretty marginal where I could easily just be burning money."
poker,3cdan3,obeydadawg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"Actually he really was my 3 bet friend in this guys BB a lot it was a gift. I floated a ton of his continuation bets and pushed him off his nothing on the turn a lot. He didn't really know how to play to a check raise, seemed as though his entire game was to play big pots preflop continue bet light and fold to any aggression at all post flop unless he had something."
poker,3cdan3,beholdmycape,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:21:40 2015 UTC,I kind of thought that SB might have my outs in his loose 3 bet range   I'm not following.  In your OP you said he raised blind.

poker,3cdan3,RinnyFlamboyant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:29 2015 UTC,"Isn't UTG's range at least a little bit wider than everyone seems to think in this thread?   Presumably he would open at least down to AKo, TT, maybe even AQo? That's not exactly wide at less than 1 in 20 hands. Against that range we have like 55% equity. We can get away from A high flops, and occasionally stack him because of our set possibilities. It feels to me like a call really isn't too bad.   We could even find a squeeze here ourselves if the LAG is too loose. We can fold out UTG's TT-JJ and AQ, AK possibly and play against the SB's much weaker range and in position.   I'm assuming the SB is bad based on other comments in the thread!   If he's decent he should have AK+ and QQ+, AQ+ and JJ+ at a push. In that case I feel like equity is now in his favour and you could find a fold here. Then again, if you're 200 deep your range isn't as clear as his, and it could be worth a call although it's marginal."
poker,3cdan3,BigfootTouchedMe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:36:27 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer all your questions other then what I've already said, however; in this circumstance I feel small blind was weak. I felt UTG was very strong given his table image, the way he played hands. UTG seemed fully aware of the game his position and so forth. If UTG had less than pocket Jacks I am surprised, I happened to be there and watch the action and this was my assessment. I think with pocket 10's he would of filled the BB blind, called any raise and adjust from there."

If I had to guess I would say it comes from an insecurity in people's play. Those that believe themselves to be much better players than they really are often can use condescension as a tool to elevate their own play in their own mind by convincing themselves they are ""that much better than this person"".

""I 3-bet with A8o in the small blind because blockers and wide button range""  ""Hey guys, get a load of this fish!""  It is an acquired taste and a problem that the subreddit has been dealing with for literally years. It is a difficult problem to solve; gambling naturally makes people salty, and it is easy to give bad poker advice unknowingly. The combination makes people who correct others almost unfalllingly insufferable. The only way to overcome this awfulness, however, is to git gud and become a regular in the sub. Two things that punish new members, and are difficult to do. The sub has stagnated because of it.  So welcome to /r/poker.

poker,3cavfu,IPlayEveryGame,3,Mon Jul 6 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Been playing MTTs again recreationally on the weekends (I used to be a grinder many years ago) and I'm surprised at how much tougher they have gotten. I recently got deep into the big 5.50 ""donkament"" and while the early stages are still pretty similar to how they used to be, looking through remaining players in the later stages, I was extremely surprised to see about 1/3rd to about 1/2 of them were profitable regs or semi regs who had 50k+, often 100-200k+ lifetime winnings on stars, and the rest were regular donks who played maybe 100-200 tourneys in total or less. Used to be that you would rarely even see profitable players at your table, but now I regularly sit down at small tourneys and have notes on one or two+ players that shows them being active regs. Sometimes I still run across players who I gave notes years ago, which is kind of funny to see them still around while I donked my roll away and went with the game development life instead.  Seeing that made me question the expected ROI for MTTs in small/mid/high stakes nowadays. Around 2012 when games were already getting way tougher cuz the poker boom had just ended, people said that really good regs could expect maybe 20-40% ROI in high stakes MTTs over a large sample, and there were even a very select few players around with 100% + ROI over a decent sample size (20k tourneys or something).   Are these numbers still attainable? Any MTT regs can chime in?"
poker,3cavfu,Protential,6,Mon Jul 6 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"40%+ ROI still is doable in midstakes overall, however requires some game selection.  Highstakes only the legends run above 25% ROI.  Micro to low-stakes can easily run above 60% yet in everything."

poker,3cavfu,yourstupidface,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"here's a ridiculously broad question for the bovada regs out there (u/Furples, idk who else). given that we're anonymous and aren't really concerned with balance, what kind of hands do you like to 3b for value from the blinds vs just flat with and how does that change depending on the villain? It seems like ppl tend to call 3bets way too much, especially when they're IP, so on one hand I feel like I should be 3betting pretty wide strictly for value, but on the other hand, playing big pots OOP with stuff like AJo really sucks even vs a wide range."
poker,3cavfu,Furples,4,Mon Jul 6 17:58:51 2015 UTC,Vs a CO or BU open I 3bet pretty wide for value and don't really bluff much except with hands that might be immediately profitable. If a 22/18 opens the button im definitely 3betting with A3s from the SB because I think it might be +EV. I'm not balancing my 3betting ranges or throwing in hands like 57s for board coverage very often though which you would need to on stars

If you do - look at a few stats and try to find leaks and then google what standard stats are for that area and then see how you compare. You start looking up one stat and you realize you have leaks all around that area. Poker books to me should be bought primarily for enjoyment these days since a lot are outdated and they tell you the same information you can find online for free anyway.

poker,3cavfu,spicygobby,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:47:38 2015 UTC,What was your thought process throughout this hand? What did you put him and and what were you repping? I'm highly interested. You may have had the best hand no?
poker,3cavfu,Cwlrs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:11:16 2015 UTC,"Flop - Only top pair 2nd kicker and better bets. AJ and AT check because AQ is the #1 flatting hand in my range. Pretty much.  So I call flop as standard. Turn, when he sizes up, pertty much means he has AK. The bottom card of the board paired, which favours me more than him, and also cuts down his set combinations. So I turn Ax into a bluff, repping trips or a set, I can flat 65s, 67s. He calls so I'm hating life a bit but not too much. Ax means I block AA. River pairs the middle card which is actually a super bad card for me since 99 is even less unlikely... But then again, if he thinks I turn 9x into a bluff here some of the time then I do improve to trips. Really weird spot. Anyway, I shovel the money in on the river as a bluff and it gets through."
poker,3ceg8m,peterw8,2,Tue Jul 7 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"Don't bet the turn. As played, you have to fold. 250 is a good amount of your stack, and looks like a very strong hand considering your stack size. If you call the turn, what about the river? Unless the 4th 5 comes or an Ace we're not loving our hand, and he's unlikely to just shut down.   Absolute best case scenario he's bluffing, and there's a good chance he'll fire again on the river making a call with just A high pretty tough, and pretty bad especially in a Double-Up SNG.  Next best scenario is he also has A high where he likely has you out-kicked, or at best chopping. So you'd be putting over half your stack in by this point hoping to chop.  All other scenarios he has a full house and you're drawing to a 3 or 4 cards at best, and he's definitely not shutting down on the river unless a big scare card hits and he has 88 or something.  Remember, Double up SNG's are all about survival, playing small pots in position and stealing in good spots. He called your flop bet and the 2 is a blank on the turn, so just hope to check it down show your A high, unless you improve of course. Betting the turn isn't horrible, but it opens you up to getting taken advantage of by a strong looking min-raise. You've gotta fold."

This gives you two advantages. You get info from his whole cards, you catch his bluff some of the time...   I think the error was not thinking ahead...

poker,3ccoux,arichone,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:39:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure every size of bet is more +EV than a check. You need to reassess your thought process. A 500 - 700 bet into 1170 is almost the same as a 1800 bet into 2700 because early in an MTT there is no ICM. no ICM also means you should be always going for max value.

poker,3cd9a9,Tiltboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:20:03 2015 UTC,If you have lost $435 in 2 months i would recommend using play money until you understand the game better. Even though that money you lost was just on Counter Strike Skins its still money which you could of sold on the steam market.  If you really want to get into poker you should start reading books on strategy there are a few out there which will help.  Start watching poker tournaments and cash games there are heaps on youtube.  When i 1st started out with poker my mates and i would just have fun games and use weed as the chips (not saying you should smoke weed). Sometimes we would go figure out what coins we need and then my mate who worked at the bank would exchange our $20 or $50 for coins. Since your too young to enter a casino this a fun alternative to live games and helps much more than just online poker.  What you need to do for awhile is live and breath poker for a couple of months to gain a proper understanding of it before even touching real money online. There is a lot more to poker than just knowing the card combinations.
poker,3cdveh,counterstrike420,2,Tue Jul 7 03:38:51 2015 UTC,Learn to play out of position well because you'll be doing it a ton. 3betting to isolate in position will probably be really useful too since you'll force the button to play less hands even with their blind.

poker,3ccgx9,DrHands,4,Mon Jul 6 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"Unlike others here, I actually don't dislike the call pre that muchl if CO is likely to call vs 4b/fold a very high % of the time (which seems to be very easy to predict in live cash settings). You are calling 30 to win $109 if CO calls (not including implied odds) and have a hand that has fairly good equity multiway. The one issue I do have with your call is that CO is short (you implied higher effective stacks in your start but he shoves flop for $200) so you're not winning much more money off of him relatively and this is a great spot for him to jam a lot of hands if he's competent. Given that he clearly isn't and seems to fit into the passive profile, the call certainly isn't as bad as others are making it out to be.  I don't like the flop play at all and think it's just bad, especially if CO is going to jam FDs/overs as he did. While you can have an 8, there are very few combinations that make sense (as someone else already pointed out) and I highly doubt the button is folding an overpair or AK/AQdd type hands (which have great equity vs you).   Pre play is ok (actually I think optimal if CO is deeper, questionable because of his stack depth), flop play is bad."
poker,3ccgx9,nickgb5,2,Mon Jul 6 23:05:13 2015 UTC,Thank you for an actual response.  Again to clarify its $100 spread so the most you can bet or raise is $100 BTN could only make it $255 after c/r as CO all in was only $200. $45 on top of my $155 c/r  Can you clarify flop c/r is bad? As I understand it he can be c-betting this board with AK AQ  99-AA maybe even AJ AT. He was the fit or fold type so he's either way ahead way behind.
poker,3ccgx9,nickgb5,3,Mon Jul 6 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"Right - but you said he was all in for $200 total, meaning he had less than 100 bigs to start the hand (which is what my point was about). If he also had $450 pre it's a snap call in my mind when you make the assumptions I did.  As far as the flop goes, you said it yourself - why c/r? You are clearly bluffing, so you want to get better hands to fold. In my mind, there are no better hands that are folding - he's not folding overpairs and he's not folding overs with diamonds. It's questionable that he's even 3bing 99-JJ, though you know villain more than I do. So when you checkraise, he's calling with all of the hands that have you crushed, folding only total misses like AK/AQ no diamonds (which you have beat anyway), and probably getting it in with big draws that you are flipping against. I would also argue that CO's range here is uncapped and he can show up with anything, even if he's folding a lot on this particular texture. Lastly, even if he is going to fold an overpair/big draw, there's just not a ton of credible 8s you can represent here. If villain is a thinking player, he'll see that overpairs are crushing your range even if they include 78s, 89s, etc. in that range - and if he's not a thinking player, he's not going to fold overpairs anyway."

poker,3ccgx9,beholdmycape,2,Mon Jul 6 21:23:25 2015 UTC,":grunch:  Raise pre is fine. It's a good hand to keep your raising range wider in late position, plus the FD/SD possibilities help you play postflop. Not thrilled with calling the raise. I assume that this plays a lot like a $1/2 or $1/3 game, based on how I've seen spread limit games go. So most 3-bet ranges at those stakes have you smashed, and you're OOP. I'd probably fold there. Especially with these villains.  Check raise seems dumb here in a SL format. Pot is $135 when he bets $55, then he's looked at $100 into $345. I hate playing the ""what does he think I have here"" game, but I can't see him expecting you to have an 8 here. Your hand still looks like a small/mid PP or a big A. You've basically got no way to improve either.  A draw seems reasonable for CO given the preflop action. A marginal 8 also fits.  OTT ... I guess you now beat an PP he had, so that's good. You hit pretty much the only card you want to see. I really don't like this spot though. If he has some random A's and PP in his range here to bet, I suppose it's OK to GII.  I don't like the play OTF, but since we've backed into a spot where we're probably ahead of a good chunk of hands, :meh:, get it in I suppose. I'd like better reads on these players, and their reaction to the board cards. But oh well."

What's V calling with on the flop that you get to fold with a min re-raise on the turn? If you're confident you're good why min raise? Just shove?

Obv the KK & 88 so (and sorry am at work so can't help with equity calcs) you have to just figure out if it was the right play using the numbers.   I think that you have to just take the hit on this one as I think you have the most of his pre-flop range covered off.   Frankly your move on the flop doesn't matter a jot - no matter what you did he was calling/raising/shoving on you.   Chalk it up as just one of those hands.

poker,3ccho1,Meute,2,Mon Jul 6 21:00:06 2015 UTC,Why bet so much on the river? By betting that much you're saying you're never folding so when he shoves you have to call... Your only serious bet is on the river when you no longer have the nuts... I really don't like how you played the river... Check flat or check fold to a V shove.
poker,3ccho1,arichone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a call.  Could have 22, A4, but has a lot of other random 4s that think you may be overvaluing your Ax or random two pair."
poker,3ccho1,frnkcn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'd call, villain is showing a lot of strength on the river but he can do this with a lot of 4s.  With the range listed below you have almost 82% equity so calling is profitable.  Given that it is 1-2 I think this wide of a range is reasonable, but even if you narrow it down a bit I still think it's a call.  Out of curiosity what hand range did you put him on when you check raised him on the turn?    44,22,AJs,A5s-A4s,K4s,94s,84s,74s,64s,53s+,42s+,AJo,A5o-A4o,K4o,84o,74o,64o,53o+,43o"
poker,3ccho1,Tim_Tebow_FanClub,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"Tbh I think this is a fold. When you bet 55 on river you're basically saying to a thinking villain that you're never folding. Add on top the fact that 1/2 villains rarely if ever raise this river without a FH, the all in looks super strong."
poker,3ccho1,chiubakka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:52:17 2015 UTC,"Eh. I hate going broke in a limped pot.  Your c/r OTT is odd. It doesn't rep much to a villain (who we have basically no read on). This sizing also seems too small to me. I'd rather make it $55 or $60 here and try to play for stacks now.  Simply leading the turn is better. Make it $15 and let him raise you if he thinks you're FOS.  I'm having a hard time coming up with a hand that limps, calls the flop, and then calls a C/R OTT. Two pair? AA/JJ/AJ should have raised pre. A4 beats us. A2 is going to think he has kicker problems OTR and probably won't jam us. Set of 2's makes sense. Case 4's too.  The best chance we have is a 4 that somehow bet/called the turn or a J that floated the flop thinking there was no way we had an A preflop (but then why would a J jam the river?).  I'm really not sure if I'd call or not. It's thin either way."

poker,3ccho1,Tulimies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"I hate your check raise sizing on the turn. Way too small. If you're going to go for a check raise here it would be better to make it like $65 at least. Your river bet is too small as well, IMO.  As played if our only read on villain is that he ""seems like an OK player"" I would call. ""OK players"" at the 1/2 level can be overplaying all sorts of hands that you beat. Yes, some of the time he's going to have A4, but he can also show up with 43s, 54s, 64s, or AJ.  Like you said, you only need to be good about 1 out of 4 times for this to be a profitable call. Unless you have reason to believe this particular villain would only shove with a full house in this spot I'd say you're definitely getting a good enough price to call it off here."
poker,3ccho1,TheDigitalRuler,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:01:47 2015 UTC,"What is villain flatting with on this flop here? What is he calling your c/r on the turn with? What is he shoving the river after your bet with? He likely raises from the CO preflop with a hand like AK/AQ/AJ so its unlikely he has those. If he has a weaker ace, is he really going to take this line? Or would he take this line with A4, 22 or 44? Maybe he's bluffing with an A3 or A5 but I doubt it.  Your line is wonky and I think prevents us from getting a better read on villain. Lead out the turn for like $15-20 and see what he does and I think we have a better understanding of his hand. He didn't call your bet on the flop with complete air so its probable he has a middling ace. If he calls your bet on the turn we can assume he has a solid ace or two pair like A2/A4, which is crucial to know with that river card."

You could consider a delayed cbet. As played, check back turn. The turn changes nothing and he would fold very few hands except AJ.  As played, shove river is a good play. The x/c flop x/c turn line suggests a Qx hand, and we will def get looked up by trips. I expect a x/r somewhere from QJ or any set."
poker,3ccdu6,withoutatrace123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:50:42 2015 UTC,"Pre I'm folding without a good reason to 3b. If he's a big fish (not just a generic one) sure I ISO, if he folds to 3b at a huge rate sure, if he spews sure. Otherwise, pick a better spot, it's zoom. On this flop, I don't see us having much fold equity. Him calling OOP versus our strong looking line makes his range hitting this board pretty hard. He doesn't have AA/KK, but JJ/ QQ/ AK/ AQs/ AJs/ QKs/ QJs plus some sticky PPs that are folding unless they spike a set.   As played, on turn we HAVE to bet, as we pick up equity, and all our monsters would cb turn. On riv, we have an easy jam, as the likelyhood of a fh is fairly low due to him not raising at any point."
poker,3ccdu6,SkeetRag,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:51:27 2015 UTC,If this was 200NL then I guess you need some bluffs in your 3bet vs. UTG range and this seems like a good hand for it. But at 10NL just fold pre and focus on fat value vs. weaker players.
poker,3ccdu6,Furples,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Though most say fold pre, I don't the mind the 3 bet IP with the Ace blocker and a suited wheel card to go with it.  Post flop, I think we need to check this flop back as it smashes the villain's 3 bet calling range. Bunch of Qxss and Jxx combos.  However, as played, I would check the turn back as the board hasn't really changed so I don't see villain check folding and we don't want to get check raised and blown off our equity. So check back and take a free river.  However, as played the river is an easy jam."

Automated check-mailing services (that can be triggered by an API call with no manual intervention) are widely available.  The idea that they have a ""high volume of payouts"" slowing them down is also hogwash.  How many active players do they have each day?  How many of those are withdrawing?  They're doing this on purpose, hoping to make more rake on you while you wait, or better yet, have you lose your money to another player who has no plans to withdraw.  I'm also wondering if some of these companies are robbing Peter to pay Paul... doing their own kind of fractional reserve banking, where they're actually taking more money than just the rake.  Thus, a ""high volume"" of payouts would really be a problem for them, like a run on the bank, because they don't actually have the money on hand.    They may be backed up alright... waiting for more new deposits to come in so they can fund the pending withdrawals.  But once these stories start appearing in forums, it only gets worse for them, as more people try to withdraw and fewer take the risk of making the deposit.  And what are you going to do?

You know that classic advice of if the table is tight, loosen up. if the table is loose, you should tighten up - you should tighten up. Don't try to mimic other players.

Pretty standard 1/2 fit or fold players. They don't understand value. they don't understand your hand. they don't understand your line. they don't understand pot odds or equity. All they see is that they have 2nd pair and they are going to have a hard time letting it go. These spots are all villain dependent. If someone will never fold 2nd pair, you can bet for thinner value on multiple streets with medium strength hands. If somebody will always fold top pair to a preflop raise + double barrel, then perhaps it will be profitable to do that.

Standard pot size preflop is usually like 50-100. my strategy over time has sort of started to reflect that of these Super LAGs, just not nearly to the extreme they take it to.   Here's leak #1, when you are at a table like this the last thing you want to do is start playing tons of speculative hands. Literally all you should be doing is playing a really tight range and blasting the pot with your value hands. Calling big 3bets with 92s is a losing play, it doesn't matter if you are Phil Galfond on Fishy McDonkerson at the local 1/2 game. You are overestimating the skill level of live 1/2 regs and judging them based on their results rather than on how they actually play.    I tend to limp/call a lot to a preflop raise. I see a lot of flops.   Here's leak #2. When I'm playing online or live and trying to quickly identify who the weak regs and fish are, this is the specific action I look for. Limping OOP is a -ev play in cash games, especially in ones where there are aggressive players who have position on you. Lets just think about why limping accomplishes absolutely nothing and why we should be raising preflop.... All we are doing is putting more dead money into a pot (usually with very bad hands) and praying to jebus that we can see a cheap flop, and when we do see a cheap flop we are usually out of position and haven't gained the initiative by being the preflop aggressor, thereby making it that much harder for us to steal pots. When we play tight and only make raises preflop we A. build bigger pots to eventually get stacks in when we have big hands and B. We leave our range uncapped, our opponent has to assume we aren't playing total garbage so when we cbet or two barrel bluff we get a lot more credit and steal bigger pots more often.    My raising range, depending on table feel and position of course, is overall pretty wide. My calling range is even wider.   This is leak #3, though the first sentence is basically the same as leak #1, so I'll be addressing the second sentence. When someone puts in a preflop raise OOP, your calling range should be much tighter than your typical opening range, not wider. The only advantage we gain is having position, but we lose a lot by calling raises a lot.... our opponents has initiative on the flop, we will have to float or bluff raise a lot of flops to stay profitable when this could be avoided by playing a tighter calling range and 3betting more hands rather than flatting. We also cap our range, when we simply call our opponent knows that we rarely show up with monster hands, they can just put a ton of pressure on us and force us to fold our marginal holdings. Finally, when we call with a wide range decent players on the button or in the blinds will love to 3bet squeeze on us and basically force us to fold.... we really want to avoid throwing away money like that.   I think a noted bigger flaw of mine is if I open up preflop and get a couple callers, miss flop and Cbet and get called, I will check turn. if it checks round, I will bluff value bet the river a lot and get called with medium strength winning hands. seems to be a recurring issue.   When you are in multiway pots and completely miss the flop then definitely consider cbetting a lot less. Live 1/2 players are going to call you with any sort of draw and any sort of pair so we are burning money by cbetting with little to no equity in multiway pots. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by ""bluff value bet the river"". Value betting is when you have a good hand and bet to get a worse hand to call. Bluffing is when you have a bad hand and bet to get a better hand to fold."

Frankly I think that he did a good thing....took the platform that he had to highlight some of the issues that needed addressing.   No real axe to grind with the guy TBH.
poker,3ca2a4,cobwebscavern,-5,Mon Jul 6 08:17:20 2015 UTC,"whats there to address. Everyone knows how it works there is nothing anyone can do to change it. People spend hundreds of dollars on a hobby. I just spent a grand on skis last winter, but as soon as someone spends(looses) money, it is wrong. Yes i know there are gambling addicts etc, but this is a different problem entirely.  I dont like what he did at the onedrop. I guess its his stance to take, but Tv poker is about characters and not so much the game. Although you only have to pay your rake, I do believe that you owe the venue/casino/other players some sort of interview or a least a ""moneyshot"". Kinda autistic what he did"

poker,3ca2a4,wojiaokeandi,3,Mon Jul 6 13:24:33 2015 UTC,What was the 2p2 post?
poker,3ca2a4,maximum_wages,9,Mon Jul 6 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"I really don’t owe anyone an explanation but I’ll give one.  First off, I don’t owe poker a single thing. I’ve been fortunate enough to benefit financially from this game, but I have played it long enough to see the ugly side of this world. It is not a game where the pros are always happy and living a fulfilling life. To have a job where you are at the mercy of variance can be insanely stressful and can lead to a lot of unhealthy habits. I would never in a million years recommend for someone to try and make it as a poker pro.  It is also not a game where the amateurs are always happy to be losing their money for the sake of                 entertainment. The losers lose way more money at this game than winners are winning. A lot of this is money   they can’t afford to lose. This is fine of course because if someone is dumb enough to gamble with money they  cant afford to lose, that’s their problem. I’m not really buying that though. In a perfect world, markets are based on informed consumers making rational transactions. In reality, sadly, that’s not the case. Markets are based on advertising trying to play on peoples impulses and targeting their weaknesses in order for them to make irrational decisions. I get it if someone wants to go and play poker on their own free will, but I don’t agree with gambling being advertised just like I don’t agree with cigarettes and alcohol being advertised.  It bothers me that people care so much about poker’s well-being. As poker is a game that has such a net negative effect on the people playing it. Both financially and emotionally.  As for promoting myself, I feel that individual achievements should rarely be celebrated. I am not going to take part in it for others and I wouldn’t want it for myself. If you wonder why our society is so infatuated by individuals and their success, and being a baller, it is not that way for no reason. It is there because it serves a clear purpose. If you get people to look up to someone and adhere to the “gain wealth, forget all but self” motto, then you can get them to ignore the social contract which is very good for power systems. Also it serves as a means of distraction to get people to not pay attention to the things that do matter.  These are just my personal views. And yes, I realize I am conflicted. I capitalize off this game that targets peoples weaknesses. I do enjoy it, I love the strategy part of it, but I do see it as a very dark game."

Also pretty bold to speak for other people as a guy who doesn't want to say a good thing about Poker besides that he's thankful it makes him money.   I mean, Poker is only as dark as you want it to be. You dont have to auction your home to play Poker.

poker,3c9bje,Forgottenmudder,7,Mon Jul 6 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"As stated, poker results do not generally match expectations due to variance that is out of your control.  Also worth mentioning is that 'correct poker' is often equated with 'game theory optimal (GTO) poker'. However sometimes it makes sense to take lines that are less than optimal to exploit a particular opponent in a given situation. Who is to say this cannot be correct? Of course keep in mind that when you do this, you may become vulnerable to other players exploiting you.  Also note that you can play correctly and be a generally winning player but if you screw up with bankroll management or tend to go on tilt when the inevitable bad beat happens, then you probably won't be a winning player despite playing correctly for the most part."

poker,3c9bje,memzy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not very well versed in game theory but this is an excerpt from Bryce from Stoxpoker.  Game Theory Optimal (GTO): A strategy that yields the highest possible EV (or: “is optimal”) if your opponent always chooses the best possible counter-strategy. In a game of rock-paper-scissors the GTO strategy is to choose randomly from an equal distribution of paper, scissors, and rocks. If you play rock less often than paper, you will have less than ½ equity against an all scissors strategy. Similarly, you must play paper at least as often as you play scissors, and scissors at least as often as you play rock. As a result, you must play paper, scissors, and rocks with equal frequency to guarantee ½ equity against all strategies. So long as your opponent always chooses the optimal counter-strategy to whatever strategy you choose no strategy on your part can have a higher EV than this.  I'm curious to why this is wrong.

poker,3c9bje,PuckDaFackers,2,Mon Jul 6 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"This guy has it.   Look at your poker career this way. Stretch out all the hands you've won or lost or ever will win or will lose over a loooooong graph. This will be your lifetime edge.  For a winning player they will show profit at the end of this chart. A losing player won't. What every single chart will show if you look at a sample size selection is variance.   The worlds best player will have stretches where he seems like an absolute idiot and the worst player in history will look like a god if you cut your lifetime graph into a tiny sample size.   TL,DR:  make the best poker decisions you can every time. It will benefit you. Don't sweat the results as long as you made the right move."

Short term, you could get away with stupid stuff, but gamblers are stupid and never back away when they should and instead lose all their winnings + more.  It's better to try to play good Poker rather than do something you know is unnecessarily risky just to try to get a quick pay-off, unless any potential money lost means nothing to you financially or emotionally"
poker,3c9bje,hMJem,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to offer an explanation. Playing winning poker IS playing correctly if you aren't being results oriented. But you can be a winning player and not be at poker or at least not as good as another player who is break even or slightly losing.  A person might not make the best decision everytime it comes around to him but if he just gets enough value for the times he does then it could make the difference between being a winning or break even player.  Look at Tony G. He really isn't that good at figuring out his opponents when it comes to putting them on hand ranges and what they might call with or fold but he's really good at finding ways to create situations that put his opponents on tilt or otherwise make mistakes against him. So in a sense he's not really playing ""correctly"" in so far as the way he's playing the game but if you include the psychological aspects of the game he's doing it right if it helps him to win more."

On the flop and turn, I went for value. The check calls SCREAMED KQ and then he river raise I thought, he hit some random two pair.   Honestly, i wanted to fold the river. I reluctantly called.

Villain kind of played it bad as he didn't get his entire stack in the middle, which is probably what you should've lost this hand. The raise on the river is a bit alarming but other than him having a set there isn't any two pair hand combination I can see him having in that spot. You probably aren't getting re-raised a lot in that spot when you're still ahead but your hand is too good to fold too imo. Just a bit of a cooler."

poker,3c6sq8,observer24,2,Sun Jul 5 17:18:58 2015 UTC,He was looking to sell up to 25% on tasty stakes.  I feel like he would have already sold some to friends/backers before putting it up there.
poker,3c6sq8,Smushmachine1,2,Sun Jul 5 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps.  But he only sold 5% on tastystakes, so I would still guess that the total amount of action sold was less than 25%.  Granted, its impossible to say for sure."
poker,3c6sq8,observer24,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'm confident that he could sell as much action as he wanted.  So if he was looking to sell 25% on tasty stakes, after what ever he originally sold, I feel like he was still able to sell it outside of tasty stakes.

poker,3c6sq8,Smushmachine1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:55:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed that, normally, he COULD sell as much action as he wanted.  Though two factors indicate, to me, that he probably did not sell a lot of action for this tourney.  1. he set markup at 15%.  That is high even for a player of his caliber.  I interpret that markup as ""I don't need to sell action because I hit a satellite so I will charge big markup,"" which leads into point 2. I think the beauty of binking a sat for a guy like rast is that BRM isnt such an issue anymore and he an go for the big score.  But, I certainly see you point of view as well.  He's got a wife and such so maybe he did decide to, and was able to, sell a lot of action.  Its nice to engage civilly with someone on this thread.    Edit: 15% really isn't that big of a markup..."

poker,3c76wt,Cwlrs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this will convert easily but here goes:  This is a spot which is incredibly rare because most people won't check back flushes on this turn, and I thought the river was really interesting. Basically in these games, most people will 3b like AKo for offsuit combos, and almost nothing else. Whereas suited stuff  can be anywhere from 2 broadways to 45s to like 79s etc etc. Hence I think river is a call since he's cbetting turn with all made flushes and only some random offsuit junk improves on the river.

poker,3c76wt,JoeFlacco05,2,Sun Jul 5 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"Well I'm basically putting him on a Big Ace that has the Ace of hearts in it. He 3 bets pre then C Bets flop. He checks turn because he still doesn't have a pair yet and wants to get to the river cheaply and if you made a flush he doesn't want to be check raised here. Also jacks are hitting your opening range quite a bit. My main concern is that you didn't bet the turn. I think you got too cute with a marginal flush. If you had the nut flush and you though maybe he had the King of hearts it would be a good spot to let him get there and think he's good but you really need to protect your hand here and not let him draw cheaply at beating you. Even if he just had something pocket 10s with the 10 of hearts he's gonna win the hand. The 4th heart hits and he's just taking you to value-town now that he's made the (almost) nuts. Calling off with an 8 high flush is pretty bad at this point too, what are you hoping that he turns over in this spot? Ace King with no hearts?   adding on to the reasons for betting the turn. Having a small flush can work in your favor too. If he does hold the Ah like I suspect he does he can't put you on many suited combinations of hands that are ahead of him on the turn that would raise and call a 3 bet. You're basically put on KQhh, K10hh or Q10hh. Maybe 89hh. Point is, your hand strength is well disguised based on the line you took, and you managed to make your hand and not make him pay for a redraw or get any money in while you we're ahead."
poker,3c76wt,Cwlrs,4,Sun Jul 5 16:01:58 2015 UTC,I have to check back this turn with some flushes to protect myself on rivers. Otherwise I can get x/r on rivers with my thin value hands and get blown off them.
poker,3c76wt,JoeFlacco05,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, but by some flushes it should be the ones that aren't going to be an insta-muck if a 4th of a suit hits the board on the river."

I also hate it when people are so convinced they're correct when really they are almost clueless. Although I'd prefer not to enlighten you, because I've stated that ''you're wrong'' I feel like I must justify it.  So, we can easily check back turn with some kind of AhQx hand. Pretty rare but I might float with close to nut non pair on a 9 high board.  So if we want, we can fold this garbage 8 high flush if we feel our range is protected.  Secondly, we want to bet our best flushes on the turn to jam the river for max value. It makes sense our worst flushes will be in the check back range for protecting that range.  Thirdly, the chance of a 4th heart coming out is 16% chance assuming villain has a random hand, but if he has a heart in his hand, then it's even less. Furthermore, given villain didn't barrel turn, we can take away some AhXx KhXx combos too, even though they are rare combos due to them being offsuit.  Fourthly, checking back some flushes allows villain to bluff river with some air, some of the time. Savee"

BvB play looser as it is less likely villian has a monster.

poker,3c76wt,DASoulWarden,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"Newb here.    I checked the faq's cheat sheet, and apparently I should fold if there's at least 1 card that's 8 or less. Is that alright, am I missintepreting it? If that's correct, please explain why."
poker,3c76wt,ILikeRaisinsAMA,2,Sun Jul 5 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"Begin to ask ""why"" more. As a general rule of thumb for a brand new player, it is a decent idea to fold if you have a card 8 or less because the biggest leak new players have is not folding enough. There are tons of exceptions to that rule of thumb, for example folding 78s on the button in an unopened 6-max pot is a blatant mistake, since your hand being ahead ahead of your opponent's range, plus your position advantage, combine to make raising the optimal solution on your turn. Same with A8s in that situation.  So start asking ""why?"" more often. Why should we fold if there is one card less than 8? Several good answers are: ""my hand is unlikely to be the best before any cards come on the board,"" ""my hand is unlikely to make the best hand when the board comes out,"" or ""the lack of connecting cards in my hand makes it unlikely for my hand to draw to a premium hand that will win."" You want reasons for all the actions you take, and if you cant find a good reason, then the action might be bad, or you have more learning to do.  I would recommend looking into the statistics of poker playing, specifically your VPIP (voluntarily put ($) in pot, that is, the hands you play that does not include your checked BB), and your PFR (pre-flop raise percentage, that is, the percentage of total hands dealt to you that you raise pre-flop). If you are playing live poker, it can be difficult to estimate, but if you are playing online poker there are programs to track it for you. As a general rule of thumb you should be playing less than 30% of your total hands dealt to you (your VPIP; most would argue less than like 27%, I say it is stake, game and table dependent) and should be raising pre-flop a percentage within 3 points of your VPIP. Naturally you are playing less hands out of position and more hands in position, so your numbers naturally vary from each position. There is a lot of reading material that expands further, but thats a good rule of thumb.  So understand the ""why?"" answer to the cheatsheet: ""Because the new player's biggest leak is playing too many hands, this is a general rule of thumb to help fix that leak."" Then begin to explore ways to fix that leak, beginning with constructing opening ranges for your positions based on the game and stake you are playing.  Shoutouts to Pokerstove and Equilab, two free programs that can calculate a hand's equity by simulating thousands of board run-outs in seconds. That way you can see if it is truly worth playing, and even see how that hand holds up to a constructed range of hands that the opponent can be holding. It is an essential tool that you should have no hesitation downloading... both are free, Equilab has more features and is newer."
poker,3c76wt,rockandchalkin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on a lot. But one things for sure, don't have a standard line where if you get a certain card that's low enough in your mind to make you auto fold. Adapt to the game you are playing and players you are playing with."
poker,3c76wt,akaPeanutButter,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but you're kind of drawing the wrong conclusion. As a new player, it's best to get a grasp of the basic concepts necessary to win, and the most basic aspect is value betting, or betting when you have the best hand. Most beginners guides will tell you to play a tight range, or only the strongest hands. This means that you are much more likely to have the best hand in most spots and simplifies your decisions. Once you feel comfortable playing these hands you can start to add more hands to your range."

If the villains in question truly have a wide open range and would shove their draws/TPGK type hands there then you are burning money by folding overpairs. The only time you should be getting away on flops like that with stack depths like that is when you're against very nitty villains who never raise without the effective nuts (which are pretty easy to spot in live poker). Otherwise get it in and be happy most of the time.

Hopefully you'll be doing a bit more of the 'taking' but you can have some lengthy stints where that just isn't the case.  Here, against the opponent you described (wide calling range pre and loose aggressive post) it's easily a cooler. There are hardly any combos at all that have you at less than 29.6% equity, which is how often you need to win to break even. Shit, if he has 9-7 and you have the Qd, you're at 29%, and it's only very slightly -ev.  So you don't want villain to show up with two pair or sets.  Everything else is a long-term gain for you. Can we assume he 3-bets AA and KK, and folds 92, 72 to the raise? If so, you're only -ev against 18 combos which is practically nothing."

My question is, how do I avoid their monsters when they play a fucking gut shot like its the nuts?    You don't.  If a player is playing top set the same as bottom pair, you just happily get your money in.  They have waaaaay more combos of hands that you beat than hands that beat you.  However, calling a hand and shoving a hand isn't playing it the same."
poker,3c8da3,thermobee,3,Sun Jul 5 22:26:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like we're missing something here.  If he's loose-passive, that means he just calls your raises incorrectly with gutshots, backdoors, etc., with poor pot or implied odds.  It doesn't mean he shoves in those same situations.  Loose passive means calling raises to the river with high cards, low pairs, weak draws, etc.  ATM players.  It doesn't mean shoving.  If you're saying the guy shoves in reaction to any post-flop raise (he could have anything!), that's not loose passive.  Thus, I'm guessing he wouldn't ""do the same shove with anything.""  I'm guessing he wouldn't shove with 23 diamonds.  Thus, the shove is telling you something.  On that board, the shove is telling you he flopped a set or two pair, both of which beat you.  But since he cold-called your preflop raise (would he really do that with 92 or 72?, that would be idiotically loose---maybe 97s is in his cold-calling range), he likely has a pocket pair.  He probably doesn't have an overpair or he might have re-raised preflop (10-10+ are potential re-raise hands for a loose player, but maybe not for a passive one).  He'd be pretty foolish to shove with a middle or low pair.  Thus, he flopped a set.  In fact, against an early-position raise, if I had a low-ish pocket pair, I'd play this exactly the way he played it.  I'd cold-call your preflop raise, say ""eureka"" under my breath when I flopped the set, and maybe shove on your flop raise (or maybe just re-raise, or maybe just call to milk you on each street, depending on what I thought I could get from you---if you had AK, I wouldn't want to scare you).  If I thought you were the type to go all in with an overpair, I'd shove just like he did."

Those stakes also have people who go nuts if they flop TPTK. But, there are also good players there. It's hard to know the skill of players at 2nl since it's so varied in general.   At 2nl I stopped bluffing on turns with people like your kramburger because they will call you down with anything - and also because you didn't disguise your hand well imo. It's easy to well when someone thinks AK means they are entitled to the pot with these big bets that don't make sense. To me, he figured out you were bluffing with AK/AQ or trying to push him out of the hand with a high pocket pair at best. I would fold this and next time skip the turn bluff. Also, it's 2nl, you don't ""have to call"" an all in ever, especially with nothing. At least I wouldn't have called in your situation. ""Table image"" and other things aren't as meaningful down at 2nl, and plenty here will tell you to play ""abc poker"" at 2nl, which I take to mean don't try bluffing too hard or getting too creative. If you hit a hand, play it, because people like krum may be calling down with pocket 2s. If you miss, just let it go. Just my big blind though. I play 5nl and 10nl having moved up from 2nl recently so I'm no pro but I've spent a good amount of time down there for what it's worth."
poker,3c92rz,Witcrew,2,Mon Jul 6 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"I went once a couple of months ago and it was pretty fishy, at least my table (there were two full 1/2 NLHE tables going). There were 1 or 2 guys at my table that were decent, and everyone else would probably be losing players at 5NL on Bovada. I played pretty straightforward TAG and crushed.  Here's a noteworthy hand that was pretty indicative of the overall table play:  A guy raises to ~10 in EP, guy behind (his friend) calls, a dude ships it for 90 over the top. Both of the other dudes call. One has A9o and the other one KTo. The dude that shipped over the top had AA and busted them both, and they bought back in for 100 each and kept donating. They must have each lost 500 within an hour.  In general, a lot of limp-calling pre. Ton of terrible bet sizing, like betting 10 into 50 on the flop, and then 10 into 80 on the turn. A few younger guys that thought they were Tom Dwan trying to hero bluff these older guys off of a TPNK hand and failing miserably.  TL;DR: Pretty soft game overall. Mostly weak players, but hard to say if that's the norm since I could have just gone on a good night.  EDIT: Also have to mention that the vibe in there is gross as fuck. It looks like someone gave their mom/wife $300 and told them to go pick up some generic decor from Hobby Lobby. Super bright, and feels more like an office (pretty sure it used to be one) than a poker room. Not that it matters really, but it kinda made me miss playing in a real poker room even more."

poker,3c61yn,PokerJunkieKK,5,Sun Jul 5 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I didn't really track my expenses since I've been here.  I'm staying at the Rio and I eat pretty cheap.  I'd guess it costs me around $75 a day to stay here food included.  It could be done cheaper if you wanted.  I've talked to lots of guys who went in with their friends and rented houses or Airbnb places.    One thing I'll say about the WSOP that I didn't realize until I got here is that there is something for poker players of all levels and bankrolls.  There are daily tourneys with $135 buy ins, single table sit n gos, and 1/3 cash games.  Then there are games and tourneys up to the highest levels.    If this is something you want to try, come on a small budget and try it.  It can be done."

poker,3c7twu,ojogogewa,3,Sun Jul 5 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"1.) You lose EV when you do have a monster  2.) You lose EV because you have no fold equity against other players at the table  3.) Trying to play extremely advanced mind games (maniac image on a short stack) will just cost you more $ then you earn because you'll have to spend a lot to create the image but have no fold equity against the larger stacks. They'll just think you're a fish coming to blow your stack and they'll call you down. If you have a larger stack, you can create the image while still taking down pots.  Just start with a full stack, play slightly loose and aggressive. Talk a bunch and make conversation when you sit down at the table. This will generate the image you need, not your stack size. Then start to play TAG for a bit, but still make conversation when you can. Then rinse repeat.  If you sit down and get AA, you'll most likely get a ton of action cause you're a new player and you started talking right away. But if you're buying in with 200nl, you're less likely to get heads up and you're missing out on EV because you're not full stacked."

Personally I find that most of my big losses come when I'm on tilt, I'll reload and instantly run pocket Queens into Aces when it's obvious the other play must have them or Kings. I've found that even just taking 5 minutes to go get a drink and then reload helps me get off tilt and feel like I'm going into another session where I don't feel like I should immediately be trying to win the BI I just lost back.  I'd recommend reading a book or too as well and some of SplitSuit's stuff on youtube, really gives a beginner a nice example of how you should be thinking about hands."

poker,3c7024,Ghostsuit,4,Sun Jul 5 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"If your opponents could have anything, but you always show up with the top of your range, what do you think will happen?"
poker,3c7024,Spursfan14,2,Sun Jul 5 19:21:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree they could have anything but usually they tell you what they do have very quickly so putting them on a range isn't needed.   Against these players just play ABC poker and you will profit sure they will suck out on you plenty of times but you'll profit in the long run.
poker,3c7024,Spursfan14,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, I've had some very weird experiences on Pokerstars 0.01/0.02. Had a guy raise me $.50 leaving himself $0.11 on the river. I've got pocket aces as an overpair but I think I'm probably beat, I'm getting a good price so I put him all in. He folds.   I've pretty much given up trying to play even vaguely sophisticatedly, it's most effective to just play ABC poker."
poker,3c7024,window_turnip,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:41:10 2015 UTC,If he did it with complete air the bluff might be -EV but the fold will always be +EV.
poker,3c7024,window_turnip,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure he didn't get there with air though, the flop was a rainbow and there wasn't a straight draw on it at that point. There was pretty heavy beating on all the streets leading up to the river, but then anything could be going on at these stakes.  A bluff is most likely though you're right."
poker,3c7024,jzhoodie,3,Mon Jul 6 00:38:19 2015 UTC,"Try playing with a 50 BI bankroll management. You will eventually settle into playing the game and when a bad beat doesn't affect your bankroll significantly you will learn to overcome your tilt, you should understand that it is a long term investment, not a get rich quick scheme. If you get it in as a favourite and lose, that shouldn't upset you, you should be pleased you got it in as a favourite, as in the long run you will turn a profit against these players, and that's all that matters."

This is just the luck aspect of poker. This doesn't tilt me as much. My main problem is mistake tilt.    When I fuck up myself, I just get frustrated. I feel like I should fix my leaks to prevent this kind of tilt. Or start playing the most ABC of play styles."
poker,3c7024,CarNNNN,2,Sun Jul 5 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"Okay so I guess the way to fix this would be working on improving your game. There's loads of content out there, free or premium, just search for poker training/strategy. If there are hands you have played which you aren't sure if you played them correctly, post them to forums like here or on 2+2, and get involved with discussing other people hands, and this should help your own play in future. You should be spending almost as much time studying the game as you are playing."

He equates folding to losing which isnt wrong.   Also the first few words in Theory of Poker have Bobby Baldwin stating (paraphrase) good players get sucked out more because shitty players can only win if they suck out one of the 2 cards they need to win the hand.

My most similar story to this would this one time I ended up +$60 after a 12 hour grind fest at my local casino. I was playing 2/4, lost 2 BIs due to a combination of bad play and the deck feeling pretty cold. Managed to get back to $1260~ (2x$400 BI + $400 current BI + profit) by the end of the night by slowly playing better over the course of the night.  I still remember this one hand that got me a decent portion f my stack was due to the sickest read I've ever made in life. It went something along the lines of being dealt AJs, 4bet bluffing a super solid player who I was almost 100% sure had queens. For some reason, I remember in that moment that not only I knew he had the ladies, but he knew I knew. Flop came 9 high, and betting out 60% of pot, he threw away his queens face up.  Even though I was pretty much break even for the entire night (pretty much made 1BB/hr, i was actually really proud of myself for how I played towards the end."

poker,3c8yfe,hexag1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"The pot will chop when two players are using the same 5 cards to make their final hand:  The pot would chop in this case:  Player 1: 3 4 Player 2: 5 6  Board: A 8 9 Q 10  Because both players are playing the board (let's assume neither player has a flush). But if instead of 3 4 Player 1 had K 3 he would play:  A K Q 10 9 as his strongest hand which would beat player 2's:  A Q 10 9 8.  So the pot will only chop if two or more players are using the same 5 cards, otherwise progress down their hands until you find the first difference between them and then take whichever is stronger.  So in your example the pot will chop because the 5 cards which make the best hand are the same (A 2 3 4 5), anything outside of those is irrelevant to the outcome."

No limit Holdem isn't a game where someone with absolutely no experience can sit down and have a decent chance of winning against experienced players. If you are set on playing, make sure you spend some time reading up on the rules beforehand. If you want to have a decent chance of not losing your money in 1 session then I'd recommend playing extremely tight and spend your time observing other players and how they play.

poker,3c6ruj,bofferdk,3,Sun Jul 5 11:16:37 2015 UTC,"Like your thinking throughout this hand and your bet sizing late tourney. I would question the river play. Tourneys are about survival and you took too big of a risk against a stack that could threaten your life. Against a smaller stack, it makes sense. He played it well and his decision not to lead out on the river, in part because you might stack off, was right, so it cannot be 100% that he should bet out on the river with a T-high straight. JT is still in your range too. How was your table image? Is it possible that he saw you as an aggressive player who might try to buy the chopped pot?"
poker,3c6ruj,miles5555,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"My image was pretty TAG. I didn't love it when I shoved, however it just felt strange checking it back when he nearly never will have it here. But Guess I was wrong and should have checked back."
poker,3c6ruj,miles5555,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:04:40 2015 UTC,"But if he doesn't have the T here, which I will assume to be clearly most of the time, don't you think he will be folding a lot to my shove since he got bad pot odds and ICM pressure?"
poker,3c6ruj,RudolfKGB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:06:33 2015 UTC,"It's a good realization that he ought to lead out with a Ten. Let's say he leads out 80% of the time.  Against someone who has a smaller stack who does not lead out, you put his tourney life on the line.  Say he folds half the time when it's a chopped pot and you lose your bet 20% of the time when he lays in wait for you. You can do the math.  In this situation, you put your tourney life on the line and that changes everything. In fact, by playing against a bigger stack, you applied the ICM pressure to yourself. If he checks the river with his Ten about 20% of the time, then you get 0 ROI 20% of the time when you were about to make the money. Those extra chips are valuable but they aren't worth the money disaster of coming out with nothing."
poker,3c6ruj,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:08:09 2015 UTC,I'd just check back. If he's the type that folds these hands I think he'd lead put rather than lose the hand every time on this runout. Also I'm basically always checking better than a 9 high straight on that board because people will try to bet you off a chop so often.
poker,3c6ruj,RudolfKGB,0,Sun Jul 5 11:22:21 2015 UTC,"I mean I very rarely will lose the hands here I believe, since he very rarely will have a T, it is more if the risk-reward is good enough, and it is hard to tell since I can't really know how often he will fold if he didn't have the T."

poker,3c4uyi,Joong,8,Sat Jul 4 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"I was just wondering why the possibilty of 77/66/44 is never discussed in this problem   Yes, 77, 66 and 44 are all possibilities on the flop. Harrington doesn't mention this and I think that this is an omission, sets are a decent chunk of a continuing range vs a pot sized cb on the flop. I don't know why Harrington dismisses it, perhaps he considers it unlikely, or an unavoidable cooler, or maybe ( and most likely IMO) he just forget to put it in.  Also:   Villain checked on the flop, showing either weakness, checking to the pre-flop raiser or slowplaying   This is kind of meaningless, so villain could be weak, or strong, or just checking his entire range. That says nothing. In 2015 people tend to check their entire range here quite a lot. I think I would be checking 100% here as villain.  Something to remember is that Harrington wrote this in 2003 IIRC, which in poker terms is like ancient history. The pot sized flop bet for example is incredibly dated, I don't think protential would be potting the flop here. That doesn't mean that these books are not valuable, I read the Harrington series and it was super helpful for me. But the main use was learning how to think about basic ranges and plan for future streets (eg. what happens if a straight / flush / overcard comes in, what happens if villain raises, how can I get stacks in by the river etc.). So I think you reading the book critically and thinking if there is any alternative ways to think about / play hands is great."
poker,3c4uyi,myimportantthoughts,3,Sat Jul 4 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the reply! I was wondering why potting wasn't the right choice there. From the way he explained in the book, potting here would give villain not good enough odds to call if he is drawing - only calling if he had a hand that could beat me on the flop. Why would a pot size bet be bad and what do you mean with potential?  Also, where do you recommend me reading about poker if not these books?

poker,3c4uyi,Stickyballs96,0,Sun Jul 5 09:40:48 2015 UTC,"This this this everything you said right here is what I thought but didn't have time to comment. Actually I have the time but I was too lazy to do it. Tbh burn these poker books and go on the internet when you're a beginner. Sure you might find a tip or two with critical thinking but how are you supposed to be a critical poker thinker as a noob reading a book that's teaching you the basics? It's incredible outdated. Bet 4bb pre, pot bet the flop in this day and age if you want to be exploited and labeled fish."
poker,3c4uyi,Stickyballs96,3,Sat Jul 4 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for the reply.   Could you explain why potting on the flop isn't the right play? The way he explained it made a lot of sense to me.   Also, where do you recommend me reading about poker? I've tried 2+2 but it just can't figure the site out."
poker,3c4uyi,k134M,2,Sat Jul 4 22:24:15 2015 UTC,"2+2 is what I always recommend because it has free good advice that applies to the current state of poker. Harrington's actions made sense when he wrote the book but that's like me searching for tips on how to hack a vending machine from a book written ten years ago. They've patched the bug if you will. I personally am no tournament expert but I've noticed that ~2,5bb pre opens and ~half pot bets are the norm now a days. Some thread on 2+2 or a nice redditor can probably explain more in depth why that is. 2+2 can be confusing and non noob friendly before you get into it and learn all the lingo but it will be worth it. Ask away and don't take offense but take notes instead when they berate your plays. Be sure to ask people why you were wrong just like you did to me, people have a tendency to ignore the why part."
poker,3c4uyi,_limitless_,4,Sat Jul 4 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree with what a lot of people have said. There is still value to reading these books. However, you have to take it with a grain of salt. These books are old, but they are a step in the right direction in terms of logical thinking. This style of play is still a winning style in microstakes, and is a good introduction to thinking about the game other than ""what cards am I holding?"". Just realize that the game has evolved and there certainly are better sources available."

poker,3c4uyi,jvfricke,2,Sun Jul 5 02:28:27 2015 UTC,The book probably isn't totally bad for learning the game but poker has definitely evolved past the era in which this book was written. Just from the hand example he said that a call with something like 87 would be bad when people in the small blind will float that flop with two overs knowing it didnt hit the original raisers range very often either and attempt to take the pot in later streets. The book is very straight forward in regards to that and assumes everyone is kind of just playing the value of the cards in their hand.

Probably reasonable from MP. http://i.imgur.com/IYLS8ls.jpg  Also, you felt calling was bad. Why do you think it was bad -- do you think you should have raised, or you think you should have folded.

poker,3c41kd,_limitless_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like the pre flat against a shorty. You risk getting squeezed, your payoff vs a good hand is not monstrous (like 150bb), and since it's 6max, his hand could be a wide range of hands that normally flop strong-but-not-premium hands, so he'll usually be willing to stack off light. Normally I'd be 3betting a hand like this, but again, shorty. Calling probably not +EV, and certainly a lot more volatile, than just folding it. And I say this as a guy who plays 45/30/15 as a standard in 6max.   As played, half pot flop (set your price). As played, fold flop (bad odds).  So, I would play this remarkably differently than you did. But you still got paid, so good hand."
poker,3c41kd,Cwlrs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:41:21 2015 UTC,''set your price'' is terrible logic. It opens action for others to x/r or re raise.   ''bad odds'' on flop. Of course. The game is such that you never have direct odds to draw to a stronger hand. It's all about implied odds.  Preflop call is just something I'm experimenting with.
poker,3c41kd,_limitless_,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that's how I play it. There are TONS of other considerations that I didn't mention, which I summed up as ""set your price"" -- including an outright win or taking a free river. And YMMV based on the c/r frequency of your games.   Experiment with the preflop call when you've got a guy 200bb deep who's raised UTG -- much more likely to have a premium hand, and better payoffs when it hits. You certainly don't have odds to draw to 2p/straight 60bb deep... you'll be looking at playing really tough postflop spots with 2nd pair. Which is fine if you're great at reading hands, but risky if you're not."

Next buy in I have AQdd in the sb, everyone folds to the button who is very aggressive, he raises to $13 I 3b to $35 flop comes A36, I check and he checks behind, turn comes 10d giving me the nut flush draw, I bet $40 he goes all in for about $130 I snap and he turns over a set of 6's.

I have never played live before, so I'm looking for advice on how to approach this.  I imagine that the field will be harder than the average nightly tournament because it is only open to people in college. additionally, the blinds are 20 minutes which as I understand is fairly quick for live tournaments.  Going in I think I have a slight edge, but it is probably small if it exists. I am mainly playing for fun, but cashing would also be nice. I am also looking to meet people my age involved with poker in the SE.

Ivey was bad ass, but another dude who has kind of fallen off the favorites list, though I still love watching his style. I mean these guys are obviously the superstars.  I was never a twitch guy, but jcarver is pretty awesome.   Shout out to Dwan as he is fun to watch too, particularly live.

You need to do a local wallet in the middle to not get ""flagged"" by your bank, took a couple of days to get all verified but it's easy once done.)

poker,3c3z6n,stupidalien,3,Sat Jul 4 19:31:17 2015 UTC,"Preflop is fine.  What's with flop sizing?  You're not getting fold equity off of low flushes from typical 1/3 players, what's going to call this size of a bet that's not a flush?  Even if we get random sets (which are unlikely due to preflop action) and other broadways calling us here, now with this overbet and no redraws, we bloated the pot and now have to play OOP, which you wanted to avoid.  I probably just x/c here, or x/r against the right opponent.  OTT, why the bet?  By checking we allow villain to bet with air and semi bluffs.  He just called our massive flop overbet which should have sent up a red flag or two.  As played OTF, I check here and re-evaluate turn/river depending on his action.  As played, easy fold.  He called a 2.5x pot bet OTF, and raised a half pot bet OTT to all in.  He might be raising here because he thinks you have a single high club and wants to charge your draw (though his sizing is way off).  The way this hand was played, he's showing up with a small to mediocre sized flush most of the time, and we're drawing dead.  You have to call 445 to win 650.  He would need to be bluffing here 68% of the time to make this call profitable, and even when he is a bluff, you need to consider any 1 club hands that will still have equity going to the river.  Easy fold.  You dug your own hole a bit here, you led into a 5+ opponent field with a 2.5x pot bet on a monotone board from the BB.  That's going to bloat the pot, and the only hands that will call are likely made flushes and 1 big club.  I don't mind the bet here, but I think sizing should have been around $20-$25, and then you should have checked the turn and called a half-3/4 pot turn bet and re-evaluate river."

Given that it is Bovada and you can't possibly have significant history with the Villain this is a pretty bad spot to bluff. Villain has a lot of reasons to look you up and given that you describe him as LAG/mergey he is more likely to look you up as people who go for thin river value generally are more experienced in dealing with river check raises. On top of all that he is down two buy in which generally tilts things more in the call range for villain.  The only way I would c/r this river is if I knew villain well enough to know where he gets off the leveling elevator. If he knows it's a terrible spot to bluff and he knows I know and I know he knows etc etc

poker,3c5jph,ExpensiveFreedom,9,Sun Jul 5 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"If you're in a situation where you're seeing lots of multi-way pots where multiple players call down... congratulations! That's actually awesome! (I assume live low stakes?)  Lots of people made lots of money exploiting these sorts of players back in the early 2000s on sites like PartyPoker.   Tighten your pre-flop range. You want to have the best hand post-flop. Include more ""drawy"" hands like 9h8h, fewer broadway-rag hands like As8d - as you observed, you're not going to be profitable going into showdown with middle pair top kicker and shit like that. Don't overvalue pocket pairs - consider anything other than very high pocket pairs to be drawing at a set. Play ultra positionally aware. Play super fucking tight in the first few positions, loosen up significantly in late position. Control the pot. If your opponents are playing passively - calling, but not betting or raising often - you'll have a lot of control over the pot size. Remember the maxim - small pots for small hands, big pots for big hands. You don't want to splash in a pot-sized bet on the flop with middle pair; conversely, since your opponents are bad, feel free to bet big with a flopped straight, top set, etc. This applies pre-flop too; if you're on the button with JcTc facing five limpers, go ahead and just limp behind most of the time.  Raise for value only. When you're playing online against a bunch of multitabling nits, yes, you can c-bet air liberally and get away with it. Live against a bunch of calling stations, you're just giving away money when you raise light. I'll put it this way - the one other person at the table who notices is the one other person at the table you don't want to play against anyways. When you do raise, make sure it is a substantial raise, especially with big hands. No need to be timid. Never slow-play anything, your opponents aren't paying attention anyways. Folding is fine. Remember pot and implied odds, and stick to them pretty strictly with your drawing hands. Don't overplay small hands; no need to take two barrels to the face with second pair and an overcard. If you miss your draw, well, that's why it's a draw; you'll hit eventually, and if you're playing odds properly, you'll make a net profit when you do hit."

poker,3c5jph,shittyartist,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:01:07 2015 UTC,"Err, I think you misunderstand what ""value betting"" is.  A value bet is just a bet based on your assessment that you're winning the hand, sized to get as much money in the pot as possible. If flop a set of aces on Ac7d2h and you're playing against people who are there to gamboooooooool and will call a 200bb shove into a 10bb pot with air, a 200bb shove is a value bet!  Basically a value bet is the exact opposite of a bluff."

poker,3c5jph,ITargetPK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:17:02 2015 UTC,we are on the same page actually. value betting the flop against multiple drawers isnt bad but if you dont want to be outdrawn i wouldnt suggest it.
poker,3c5jph,Furples,-7,Tue Jul 7 07:24:54 2015 UTC,"Genuinely saw someone do this in a casino, great player too. He was against 5 all-ins, odds were against him so he folded. Technically the right move but damn that takes discipline."
poker,3c5jph,flipperstf,-10,Sun Jul 5 13:07:42 2015 UTC,If you have 4+ players to the flop you probably want the nuts or gtfo or a draw to the nuts! If you flop a top 2 or bottom set proceed tentatively and be prepared to fold if it comes to it. If you're limping with 55 and the board comes 57K what's to say somebody else has not limped in with 77.

poker,3c6o3r,spicygobby,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:25:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's standard for the red line to be around zero, the blue line should be where you are making most of your profit. It should be more profitable in the long run for you to be having the best hand at showdown more often than not, so in my opinion you are bluffing too much trying to take down pots, and you should focus more on having the best hand at showdown to win the bigger pots."
poker,3c6o3r,MrMogz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:24:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I will take a closer look at my hands and go from there."
poker,3c6o3r,OMGThisFish,0,Sun Jul 5 12:52:39 2015 UTC,Not exactly but you are correct it's more standard to have a positive blueline and the redline neutral or descending. However it's all dependent on playstyle. Just keep doing what are you doing OP. A positive redline is an indictation of a very skilled player.
poker,3c6o3r,MrMogz,2,Sun Jul 5 13:29:56 2015 UTC,A positive redline in correlation with a positive blue line is an indication of a skilled player. Up to 10NL one should be focusing on a VERY positive blue line as that's where the money is made. You can worry about outplaying V's at 25NL+ IMO.

What did you change? And why? You're breaking even over the last 7k hands, and it's due to you not winning at showdown it looks like.   Do you only focus on winning without showdown? If so, you're leaving a lot of profit on the table.  Also, what are your stats?"

poker,3c6o3r,OMGThisFish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"No offense, but you're playing the game backwards...same with OP.  The perfect poker strategy would be to always get to showdown when you have the best hand, and when you have the worst hand never get to show down (either by folding or by bluffing).  To always get to show down when we have the best hand takes incredible hand reading skills and a great comprehension of board textures as well as mastering bet sizing.  So.   Since you aren't winning at showdown, that means your bet sizing logic is probably flawed. If your bet sizing logic is flawed, then you probably aren't doing good hand ranging...because if you were, you'd understand how important bet sizing is against specific ranges.  This leads to the high probability that you might not have a great understanding of board textures. Because if you understood board textures, then you would naturally be good at hand reading, and if you're good at hand reading then you would naturally be good at bet sizing, because you have a better idea of how your bets affect your opponents range.   My advice: Stop trying to win as many pots as you can, and instead focus on winning huge pots against weaker opponents. Because as you move up, the strategy you're currently playing is going to crumble since it's not even close to optimal."
poker,3c6o3r,DasBaaacon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Lol.  I think you are thinking about it the wrong way. Poker is a game about exploiting weaknesses in other peoples gameplay, and people do a ton of folding mistakes that I think alot of people like to just ignore because ""Just play ABC poker and valuebet, fold to raises and play tight"" is the norm. My strategy evolves around exploiting this weakess in the playerpool. Maybe it is not sustainable at the nosebleeds, but saying that it is going to crumble at the higher stakes is just retarded. Here is a link to a 500NL zoom crusher. Please tell me, at what stakes will this kind of strategy ""crumble since it's not even close to optimal""? For the sake of proving my point even more, here is two graphs that /u/Cwlrs posted a while back. 100NL Zoom and 200NL zoom.   Go back to nitting up and bumhunting, Im gonna play SLAG and steal your blinds and the medium pots you give up.

poker,3c57u3,lol_subreddit_hero,3,Sat Jul 4 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah hand 1 easy call. Hand 2 the reason it's a fold is because the small blind cold called the minraise, not just because you got minraised. At 2nl you'll see people do stupid stuff like minraise with top pair so they can get you to check to them on the turn if you call their raise."
poker,3c57u3,9betfold,2,Sun Jul 5 12:13:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks guys, that's what I did, just wanted to check. On hand 1, flop came down J26r. I bet out 20c and got minraised. I folded. Is this okay? Couldn't see that happening with less than a Jack"
poker,3c57u3,Clarityy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:59:59 2015 UTC,"Hand 1 I think you are always better checking to him as he is the aggressor. This gives him the chance to bluff.  If you bet out he can react pretty well. He will continue (mostly) with hands that beat you and fold hands that you beat. So check/calling is superior to leading out because it keeps villain's range wider. However once you do lead folding is best.  For me, definitely: check/call > check/fold > lead  On J62r it's pretty hard for villain to have a good hand. He obviously has QQ+ but he might not 3bet AJ and he has AK AQ which is way more combos. Turn is going to be tricky but in general you're fine to fold turn if he bets again, if turn goes check/check then you'll have to decide on river whether you can call.  As for you saying ""he has 10% cbet"" it simply doesn't mean anything due to the sample. Imagine he got 10 opportunities to 3bet and he 3bet once, can we conclude anything from this? Not really. The only thing we know is that he's been limping/calling a lot more than raising preflop so we can remove some hands from his range like suited connectors and low pocket pairs, as he will be caling those more than likely.  That combined with his 3bet being rather small definitely makes this a call pre."

The reason you're not getting any real replies is because your question needs context in order to be answered.  When you say ""go in"" do you mean ""call""?  Go all in?  If all in, is it a tournament, what are the stack sizes, how did the action go, how many people were behind you, what are their images?  There's a large list of missing information if this is a real question such that no one can answer for you."

Whereas there are 6 combos of AA, 6 of KK, 6 of QQ. Plus villain can have all kinds of Jx and spewy hands like diamonds or KQ.  TLDR: either 3b and get it in on the flop or call flop and check turn intending to check/shove. As played I am never folding turn."

poker,3c3ubi,Furples,2,Sun Jul 5 01:46:52 2015 UTC,can I ask another question that is probably pretty dumb? what is 'nosebleeds in Macau'?
poker,3c3ubi,lettis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:55:32 2015 UTC,Nosebleed stakes just refer to super high stakes. Macau is a place in China where a ton of Asian businessmen play for stupid amounts of money. Lots of pros have been going there in recent years to play (to the point where many people think it's a really pro-saturated environment)
poker,3c3ubi,Furples,0,Sun Jul 5 03:03:09 2015 UTC,"i don't think i have ever heard of macau been called a pro saturated market.  i went there last year and it was hands down the softest field i have ever seen.  the chinese completley overvalue hands like AK and KQ when the miss the flop, they will limp with them and call down every street with nothing. easily made $5k in pots where i was just getting called by A high or K high.   im sure the higher games would be more pro saturated but from the action i saw i wouldn't say it is much more.  i saw lots of high stakes games with half a million dollars pots and a few guys who had insane stakes like 4~ million US dollars.   didn't see a single profesional player, they were all chinese speaking in suits and ties.  saw a few of them betting $1 million on just coin flips between themselves."

PS have some pretty sick promotions where you deposit a certain amount they credit you some more (I still think they have them). It's worth depositing more to get the bonus imo.

poker,3bz50p,PalermoJohn,-2,Fri Jul 3 18:14:34 2015 UTC,But if someone is constantly eyeballing you it's rude. You can use it for a while to gain an edge but it can quickly become needless and excessive.

poker,3bz50p,solarparade,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"This is right. An amateur chess player can get lucky in a blitz game by finding a tactic that the GM may not have had time to see. Under normal time controls, the amateur is much more likely to be crushed."
poker,3bz50p,lifesaburrito,3,Fri Jul 3 16:21:11 2015 UTC,"Eh not really. I've played strong players in long tournaments and masters online and the shorter the time control, the more their tactical prowess will overpower mine. In blitz, I'm playing by intuition and knowledge. Their intuition and knowledge is stronger than mine. When there's more time, I can think through the position and figure stuff out myself, leveling the playing field.  If I have the white pieces and play for a draw, if I'm at the top of my game I can draw someone 1900-2000 rated half the time. In blitz, I'm losing 9/10 games."

poker,3bz50p,bouncingsouls,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"One of the times was because preflop a guy before him put in one chip and said raise, headphones didn't hear him so when the action came to him he put in some chips and said raise, but the raise wasn't large enough because he didn't know there had been a raise before him. The floor was called to determine how much extra he would have  to put into the pot. Can't remember the other times."

poker,3bz50p,illpoet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:54:53 2015 UTC,"Whilst I generally am not a huge fan of sunglasses in poker, I think a ban would be dumb and really hard for casino's to enforce.   I feel like you have the right to wear anything you want to a poker game including sunglasses and headphones, which are another accessory that marks you out as new school/online trained in my opinion.     The idea that just because a player doesn't like something about what another player is wearing that said accessory should be banned is laughable.   If you feel like putting sunglasses/hats/headphones/berets give you an edge in being unreadable go for it."

poker,3bz50p,Sapphiresin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:16 2015 UTC,"I think wearing sunglasses is a legitimate strategy in playing the game. Some people may blink a lot if they get nervous. Some people may dart their eyes around.    It's like when we swallow our saliva that builds up in our mouth. Swallowing can likely be a sign of ""Well, shit.""    It's been used in games since so long ago, it doesn't really make sense to ban it now.    Of course, if every player wears a hoodie, wears sunglasses, and doesn't move their entire body apart from their hands when it's their turn, it's kinda like playing online. Everyone will be like a robot.    I don't really know where I'm getting at. I think it's fine for people to wear sunglasses. I highly doubt people can use them for cheating, especially in professional settings."
poker,3bz50p,ScandalOZ,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:28:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think the no sunglasses rule should be a set rule for all of poker. It can be implemented as desired for certain tourneys.   I like wearing headphones particularly when playing MTT. I like listening to music and depending on the character or lack there of at the table, it can help me to stay focused when the play is less than engaging. But if someone is screwing up the play at the table because they can't hear what is going on then I am in favor of charging a penalty to that person."

poker,3c1mv4,manu_facere,5,Fri Jul 3 22:50:00 2015 UTC,"Whether or not this was a good shove really depends on a few more factors than what you've given here.   It depends whether or not we are nearing a money bubble, which also depends on the other stacks on the table. If there's two people with 1BB and we're on the money bubble and we are shoving in to a 50BB stack then this is just ICM suicide.   It also depends on whether or not we have picked up any reads on the people we are shoving into, and also how many exactly. If we are shoving from the button in to two relatively tight players then we have decent fold equity and will likely pick up the blinds and antes which is great. But if we're shoving into someone who will call any two cards then this is a situation we'd probably rather avoid and just muck, in my opinion."
poker,3c1mv4,window_turnip,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:01:52 2015 UTC,He wasn't near the bubble. And he wasn't in dealer spot he was probably around hj. He would have told me if he was the dealer.  From that graph is it safe to asume that you have 43% chance of drawing a hand better than Q8s?
poker,3c1mv4,FootofGod,7,Fri Jul 3 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Each hand he gives up, his position gets worse, too. If he draws QTs next hand, he's off worse. Next hand and even KJ is possibly a worse spot. Depending on the table, one extra person in front gives diminishing returns. If he gets all the way to UTG, shoving with even AT becomes marginal. So it's not like he had to ""just draw a better hand,"" he had to draw an increasingly better hand for each time he fails.     Still doesn't make it right or wrong, but food for thought on how you're logically approaching the problem."

Open that up and work your way down all of the free resources.  Some will be better than others, some will be outdated, but it'll be a decent way to improve your skills.

A really slow run had me donkey-call an all in on pocket 8s, although to be fair, based on the read of the players (incredibly aggressive), I did have reason to believe it was just a shove.   Amazingly the guy with the best hand had a pathetic hand of 5/7d and got a flush (although his share of the pot was tiny). I lost to pocket Js.

poker,3c0d11,dakevs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:13:51 2015 UTC,What were stack sizes? I could see you possible getting away from it. But that depends on the situation ofc
poker,3c0d11,dravenstone,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:39:02 2015 UTC,"Bovada ""can't reach the server"" so I can't get exact stats (which is the case roughly 50% of the time for hand history, but I'm not having the log in issues others have been having the last few days) -   I was UTG in 3rd 4 handed and playing pretty snug with about 420K in chips. I made it 37K to go and BB who had me covered by ~100K put me all in. Effective was pretty close though - I could have let it go and maybe climbed the ladder, but I was playing to win it.  He got the A on the flop and I didn't improve. Was a great run though, in the ~5 hours we played I got ""lucky"" only once filling up a full house which should have lost to a made straight around 3 hours in. Everything else was pretty standard save for a few overbet bluffs I made aroud the bubble and a good run of cards after it broke that gave me a really solid stack with ~70 people left.   Felt really good about the way I played, though I might have been a little too tight when we hit the FT. That said I was comfortable flipping there for what would have been a commanding chip lead or 4th. Sadly, it was 4th."

poker,3c1nkj,Touch_Of_Red,5,Fri Jul 3 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"The dealer scooped the board with the rest of the muck. BB and CO still had their cards. Mr Fishy got upset and showed his cards to the table explaining he should have certainly won that hand.

poker,3c1nkj,Touch_Of_Red,8,Fri Jul 3 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"Oh ok.  Reconstruct the board.  If the dealer doesn't remember the exact cards ask the players.  If no consensus can be drawn consult the eye in the sky.  If there is no camera the hand gets rolled back and everyone gets their money back (like the hand never happened).  Assuming the board can get reconstructed, anyone who still has a hand is still in the hand.  If you showed your hand, too bad, don't be dumb.  Action on BB."
poker,3c1nkj,E-Gabs,2,Fri Jul 3 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"While this is the correct way to go about it, I imagine when the dealer ""scooped"" the board, he/she most likely spread the deck, scooped the board AND the burn cards all together.

Would it be too slow? Would it become a thing every time a call had to be made to the floor? I don't know. But, I'm sure if the floor was losing money, they'd definitely go to those tapes."
poker,3c1nkj,Is-idiot,2,Fri Jul 3 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be an issue. The only problem I see with ""going to the cameras"" in order to try to reconstruct the board is that, if the deck, board, and discards were all mucked together, then there is a high chance that the turn and river wouldn't be the original cards."
poker,3c1nkj,binhu,3,Sat Jul 4 05:29:54 2015 UTC,Retrieve the flop with help of camera footage if needed. Deal the last two streets with no more action and award the pot to the winner.  Edit: The raise on the flop should be ruled a call since BB was not allowed to act.
poker,3c1nkj,gusty_bible,2,Fri Jul 3 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting spot. I'm not well versed in finer points of poker rulings, but couldn't the flop have been put back, the pot returned to the middle, and the hand play out as it would have? I don't see any disadvantage to that."
poker,3c1nkj,RayWritesYOU,2,Fri Jul 3 23:17:36 2015 UTC,"That would have been a fine suggestion as well! The floor asked the dealer what the flop was, but the dealer wouldn't commit 100% to any 3 cards when they flipped up the muck. So, I'm sure that would have been a factor... and that they knew each others' hands, so there's that too."

poker,3c1nkj,pfoxeh,2,Fri Jul 3 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Since their hands were already exposed I think you have to rule the hand dead and chop the pot between the BB and CO.   Dealers do make mistakes, which is why it is important to protect your hand at all times. The second the dealer starts scooping the pot the BB should have immediately protested, so I guess I can see the rationale used by the floor. Unless the dealer is The Flash, I can't see how the BB didn't see it happening and couldn't react fast enough. That seems a little ridiculous to me."
poker,3c1nkj,MathW,2,Sat Jul 4 03:31:58 2015 UTC,"If I was mister fishy, I would not give up my cards. The dealer destroyed the board by mistake. If the cards cannot be salvaged, then the players who remain in the hand should be rewarded the pot."
poker,3c1nkj,BobLeBoeuf,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:11 2015 UTC,"Return the post-flop bets (15 to BB and 50 to CO) and the dealer returns the rake to the pot.  Split the pot between the BB and CO.  OR  If the flop can be reconstructed with 100% certainty (camera or dealer/CO/BB all agree), return the post-flop bets, and the dealer puts back any rake taken from the pot.  Then, run the BB/CO hands and the flop through a simulator to get the pot equity for each player.  Return the pot to the players based upon each player's equity.   I don't consider the post-flop bets because the action wasn't finished."
poker,3bzrc4,RegiTime,5,Fri Jul 3 13:51:45 2015 UTC,Very pleased with this video and hopefully it will be of use to players who are frustrated with their results at microstakes and feel they should be doing better than they are.
poker,3bzrc4,TheMagicT,4,Fri Jul 3 13:52:40 2015 UTC,"This kind of topic issue is so undervalued.  I feel that new players (like me) will always place too much weight on their ability to play 'perfect poker' and make great plays, rather than the vital skill of identifying and understanding microstakes games and the players at microstakes, most importantly understanding fish. As you say at the start of the video there are many players (I certainly know a few) that are 'good' poker players in terms of mechanics, knowledge/maths of the game but aren't winners at the micros because they don't table select, identify fish, isolate and adjust for different players (reg/fish etc), things I'm trying to do better.

Its still 33.3% b/c 2:1 odds means you win 1 out of 3 hands.  The same is true of the  second example.  Call $2 to win $6 is 3:1 or 25%.

poker,3c02k5,emj1014,4,Fri Jul 3 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"First, fold pre. Or 3bet. Don't call with A5o OOP, it flops terribly.  Fold turn. This board hits villain's range way too hard, he shows up with a lot of Kings, Queens, etc.  Check fold river. You're probably not going to get anything better to fold, and you're not really representing much here. If you had a real hand you would have lead out the turn.  Overall this was played pretty badly"

poker,3c02k5,spujara7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"I feel that hand folds the majority of the time in that spot   The way you played it in that spot, you really don't have any value hands in your range. The only value hands you have are 88 and KQ. The reason he called with JJ is because you have a ton of bluffs in your range given your line.  Also, this is 5nl, you should almost never be bluffing, and when you do, not in a spot like this."

poker,3c02k5,Stixx_27,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"A couple basics I'd highly recommend    Was it A5o or A5s?  You typed ""A5os"". Either way, since you're only 50bb deep, it can easily be a fold pre either way.    Unless you have an extremely small bankroll or you're brand new getting your feet wet, I'd highly recommend toping off to 100bb ($5.00) when you drop down a bit Don't x/r bluff at 5NL into 2 players...probably ever.  Get your value here from value betting players, not bluffing.   Sure you can bluff sometimes, but only bluff in HU pots or if you're semi-bluffing with decent equity. ""Anything I could have done to push Villain 2 off of this hand?"" Apparently not.  But you don't have to win every hand.  Take these strong lines with your made hands and get paid.  Easy game."
poker,3c02k5,_odie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Couple of things. Don't shortstack always have the table max buy in.  Fold Pre or 3bet.   It would be a weird line for value. Would you really go for check/raise turn with KQ, 88 first to act? And with that you are repping pretty thin. Probably just KQ, 88, or 22. Probably more likely you are trying to push him off a Qx type hand. And you really don't need to bluff at these stakes to be profitable."
poker,3c02k5,SkeetRag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"Have 100 bb so we have some ammunition to work with. Fold preflop, A5 offsuit has no postflop playability, especially oop and vs a IP iso raise, we're crushed here, praying for an ace that's quite possibly dominated anyway. Turn is terrible, if we want to bluff then raise more/jam, but why the fuck are we bluffing such a small pot."
poker,3c02k5,obeydadawg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"Fold pre is the most trolly response ever but man, that's all there is to this hand. There's no point in this hand where I would ever be putting money into the pot. Fold pre. But as played fold turn. You look sort of strong but what are you repping? Are you folding AK or KJ on this board? You're basically repping 22, 88 or KQ. Not very many hands.  Also, if you're more comfortable playing short stack, play short stack. Don't buy in full if you're not comfortable with deeper stack play. It's more difficult. I hate when people give new/weak/bad (not calling you any of these, IDK what you are) the advice of always buy in full. Buying in full for a losing player just makes that player lose more, faster. Pretty bad advice IMO."
poker,3c02k5,obeydadawg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yeah.  And I know all of that, I was just trying to get a creative bluff through.  I put him on a queen or an underpair, and I was trying to rep two pair. I figured he was scared of the KQ the flop, and had he bet flop I would have check raised him, but I didn't want to lead into him.    Idk. Probably badly played, he showed up with JJ, and I feel like that bluff goes through against that hand the majority of the time."
poker,3c02k5,MrMogz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"And that's why we don't bluff at the micro's. I doubt he's a thinking player hero calling you, depending on how he's been playing. He's probably just like ""JJ I got a pair why would I fold - call"". Or you've been bluffing your shoes off and he decided to look you up. Surprised you got looked up TBH, but like I said you have very few value hands. Mostly air + some semi-bluffs."
poker,3c02k5,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"Getting creative and ""repping X hand"" isn't the way to get through these limits. Your opponents are thinking about your image and perceived range, they are thinking ""I have JJ, could be good here."" Look for value and get that value. Only bluff in spots that are so clear you'd be a fool not to. This is not one of those spots. Also I'll hammer it in further, don't call extremely marginal hands from the SB to a raise. Even just completing the SB in a limped pot is iffy.    Also, say you did have KQ like you're trying to rep, would you really check again after the flop checks around? Probably not. Most people wouldn't for fear of it checking around again, since this is a hand you'd be looking to get at least 2 streets of value with. The clear play is to lead turn, and maybe that's why this villain called. Gonna go ahead and say it's not likely though, since maybe 3% of 5NL players are actually thinking further than what's in their hand and on the board. GL."
poker,3c02k5,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"You should have folded twice. Also, don't try to make plays like this in the micros."
poker,3c02k5,yourstupidface,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"Your line doesn't look strong, it looks like a bluff.   Hardly anyone checks a made hand again after the flop checks through."
poker,3c02k5,Barrabod,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"people are telling you ""fold or 3bet pre,"" but they're wrong. this is 100% a fold, you should very rarely be 3bet bluffing and A5o is not the hand to do it with.  like everybody else has pointed out, postflop is a mess, just stop and think ""will they actually fold?"" the answer is almost always no. you need to have the discipline to consider the actual likely outcome of your actions."
poker,3bzdre,all3z,3,Fri Jul 3 11:23:02 2015 UTC,For me recognising & adapting to changes in others play.....I've found it hard in the past to change a mindset towards a player once I had them pigeonholed.

poker,3bzdre,RegiTime,2,Fri Jul 3 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"Managing tilt and curing my volume addiction.  Back in 08-09 I had pretty major tilt issues. I would regularly lose my mind and blow half of my roll (BRM wasn't a strong point then either lol) and not only that, I would bang my table or other hard inanimate objects, occasionally break my mouse, one time I broke my laptop screen and suchlike.  I actually started to become a little bit ashamed of my tantrums, so started keeping a PG+C thread on a UK forum that sadly no longer exists and found that writing a lot helped me clear my mind, collect my thoughts and crucially share my experiences and learn from more experienced players responses to me.  I was incredibly candid in them and didn't hide anything. It was a long process but it started getting better. I'm far from tiltless now (who isn't?) but I've made huge progress.  The second part, kicking high volume dependency from my game wasn't quite as hard. I joined a Skype group back in around 2012 which had some excellent Stars FR regs in, one of which (a player called Magorko) is now a decent winner in 500nlz and learned a lot about the art of game and table selection.  Once I had it in my mind about playing ONLY excellent tables, I got OCD about it and went on a 1M hand heater over maybe 2.5 years where my winrate was something like 12bb at 50nl FR/6max combined.  When games started drying up in the middle of last year, my addiction returned as I dabbled with Snap when it started to gain traction on 888, winning at around 5bb/100 and hating it most of the time but recently, I have kicked it and my results have been pretty awesome again on Sky :)"
poker,3bzdre,RudolfKGB,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Something I noticed lately my self is that when I win a ""big"" sum compared to my roll, say an MTT it's like my roll get's inflated and I start to play too poor because I feel like I'm on top of the world and can win anything. This sometimes leads to playing too high.   The first time I won big was probably when I won a 180$ Spin & go when I had a 40$ bankroll. Started playing 15$ Spin & gos and as you probably can guess that money was gone as fast as it came. Which was a shame because it would've been a nice bankroll playing 1/2c, 2/5c.   This week I had the luck to get into an 3600x 1$ Spin & Go unfortunately I didn't win but it was still a nice 299$ profit. I did play 2 15$ again and losing them but pulled the brakes and said that's it for the day with the above mentioned scenario in mind. Enjoyed the thought of a nice boost to my bankroll for the rest of the day and came back playing solid the next day unemotional."
poker,3bzdre,lettis,2,Fri Jul 3 11:23:06 2015 UTC,"I had that problem too, I fixed it by not luckboxing MTTs any more. Cashing out helps if your bankroll grows significantly in a short period and you stop managing it properly."

If i have say $1000 in my poker account and i lose like $10 or $20, i generally find it nearly impossible to quit until i get back to even. As you know if you're not on your A game and you're moving up to chase your loses it can potentially hurt or destroy your bankroll. This is by far my number one issue."

The article is written decently-ish but the site is a complete mess.  I'd also like the hearts to be red, not black! Blew my mind.  We're assuming a lot of things. A guy who opens EP cbets AK on Th8h5s? Would have liked to see another picture of ranges after every street as it was hard to keep track in my head.   Although the opener has a range advantage on this flop, they can't just bet every hand in their range, as they are at a range disadvantage when called, this is something not talked about at all!

"" As pokernews.com reported, Polk can’t be too upset as he ended up scooping the pot taking his winnings to a whopping $255,000 (£163,314)."" wrong again the was dead. maybe we should give them credit for getting the players name right I guess.

poker,3c0la1,drunkenmunky519,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:55:17 2015 UTC,It is insane though because they will be all in with still half their stack. It isn't as if they're down to 4 BBs. They will still have a lot of chips to play with but shove every.single.time.
poker,3c0la1,pr3mium,8,Fri Jul 3 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"I do that once in a while, but specifically because I get a great band (Ak, 9's or higher) and people will think I'm just tilting and I'll get a call with much higher equity.  Doesn't always work (I think in live cash games it works more often), and I don't necessarily get a really great hand directly after losing a big one so its not that often.  The majority of people doing it are just rage-tilting as someone said."
poker,3c0la1,MathW,3,Fri Jul 3 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the obvious answer is tilt.   The reasoned answer is stack size.   If someone started a hand with 20 BBs, they can still wait for premiums.   If they lose a significant chunk and end up with 5-10 BBs, basic tournament strategy dictates to loosen your starting range and start open pushing marginal hands."
poker,3c0la1,mercier153,2,Fri Jul 3 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess I am just seeing it in ridiculous situations. Everyone starts with 1,500 chips. A players loses maybe 600 of theirs in a hand. The next hand, the shove with their 900. It just doesn't make sense. ."

poker,3bwsp6,persianduck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:44:46 2015 UTC,I just think if he's an aggressive player who's barreling off all his flush draws with no showdown value it makes the call a bit better. I mean how much better of a turn and river can he get to barrel off on?

poker,3bwsp6,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"The river is actually a card that should encourage you to call more. If he's got Q10 he's got a straight already so the A didn't make his hand, which doesn't mean he doesn't have it but it unless he has AA the river doesn't give him a suckout that beats you. The flush didn't come in, another straight didn't come in, the board didn't pair giving his 2 pair hand a boat. What likely happened is that card improved his hand enough to value own himself or think his bluff will work. You're only losing to Q10 or 9s here as Js, Ks, or As woulda 3 bet pre. Your check on the turn gave him the green light to bet his whole range, which would have been a pretty good move had you called the river (I still would have bet the shit out of the turn though)."

poker,3bwsp6,DingDingDao,2,Fri Jul 3 02:27:43 2015 UTC,"Seems kind of MUTB/meh. You are repping a narrower value range when you x/shove (sets mostly, KJ sometimes), and it makes it harder for him to believe you have it, which would get more hero calls/light calls long term by villain, if he had like kqss or smthing, also important to know what cards were what suit (is jtss and qjss still available combos, or is it js9s etc  Also I think in a soft live game I prefer to just bet shove.   Would x/r flop, 650 most turns, shove river if 3k effective then there's like 2.5k in middle or just under it and 1.8 ish effective. Gets a live player pot stuck"

poker,3bwsp6,suw00,2,Thu Jul 2 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Don't think you can find a fold.  It is effectively an all-in (2750 of 3k effective stack).  He bets a very valuey half pot. Hmmmm...really a tough spot.  I think your hand included a lot of busted flush/straight draw combos and is under repped in the mind of the villain.  I could see you raising the flop with a 66/99/JJ/J9 or 78s/108s/Q10s, but maybe (probably just calling) with K10s & Axs hands.  You lose to 99/JJ/KK/AA & Q10.  I think the perception of your hand though could be making villain think they are in better shape than they are.  I would probably call and hope he doesn't have Q10.  His ""how much are you playing line"" makes me think he could have Ax spades, Kx spades, or a lot of busted hands."
poker,3bwsp6,duskhat,2,Thu Jul 2 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"Any specific reads on CO?  In a vacuum I don't expect villain to have JJ/AA/KK often here, and beyond that we're only losing to 99 and QT.  Villain can show up here with KXss, AXss, and a number of two pair hands (KJ, AJ, A9 sometimes).  I'm not a 5/10 player, but I think I close my eyes and meekly call?"
poker,3bwsp6,Justachillday,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"We only lose to QT, doubt he shows up with AA and KK v often at all here. With board runout his AXss and KXss all have showdown, think he still bets them? Even turn is thin with KXss because of sizing/the fact he bet."
poker,3bwsp6,withoutatrace123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:36:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you're saying about checking back Ax and Kx hands.  Hard to say if two pair hands like AJ/KJ are betting for value.

poker,3bwsp6,MathW,3,Thu Jul 2 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"This is the second hand I played after sitting down. He's a live fish/rec, his ""read"" on me is probably irrelevant"

poker,3bwsp6,zags,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:21:07 2015 UTC,u cant fold because ur hand is basically at such a top range and like u said only losing to higher set which is unlikely because it would've been reraised otf.  qt is unfortunate but cant fold really because we cannot just assume he has qt every time
poker,3bwsp6,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"What was the point of raising OTF if you're going to x/c down the rest of the way with bottom set? If he's a fishy reg like you said he could easily be playing top pair or two pair hands like this. Assuming he is fishy enough to hold QT after an open raise from EP, he could also have KJ, AJ, J9s along with any number of weird spade draw combos. Against a range of QT/KJ/AJ/J9/JJ/99 you are more than golden enough to call it off. Just go broke with bottom set."
poker,3bwsp6,zags,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"I think I'd have to call.     First, I initially thought he couldn't be value betting with worse here, but you described him as both loose and a live fish so not going to rule out two pairs like KJ or AKss or, less likely, AJ.  So, some small part of the time, you are ahead of a value hand.   Second, he has some bluffs in his range.   Spades did not get there.  If he's loose, he could've also opened 87 or even 87ss which did not get there.   The K and A are great scare cards for him to bluff and they hit his opening range.   If you think villain is capable of running a bluff, I make this a call because there are just so many draws that missed."
poker,3bwsp6,Delex31,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:28:51 2015 UTC,This looks alot like Ax or Kx spades that made two pair. Honestly I think they show up so much more often than qt that i go for thin river value with a shove.

I think there is enough worse that you can call and not worry about it especially since you are readless. Bluffs+2pairs > higher value hands. Raising is terribad but you can get him to fold 99/JJ sometimes, just throwing that out there."

poker,3bwsp6,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:07:06 2015 UTC,"Why did you cc turn? You can't cc turn and not call this river. You have the top of your range here. Snap. I don't think many 5-10 players bet after being checked to on the turn after being cr on flop with AA. So I think his range that beats you is heavily weighted to QTss (if he's an aggro player) and JJ/99. I snap because you're so underrepped.   You could make a case for another reply saying call the floor, high five, then call but I think I usually just call."
poker,3bwsp6,runningdreams,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:05:55 2015 UTC,"You're not worried about the sets, unless you think he's really loose passive, because he would have raised them pre or on the flop. So it's just QT. It could be a ""should I play my draw?"" kind of question he asks, and you are 300BB deep, so I think QTs is legitimate worry. On wet boards like this one, I think you have to double barrel in order to get value from his 2pair hands and to charge his draws. If he has the QT, he'll show up with a raise to protect against the flush draws. Esp this deep, by giving away the lead you keep QTs in his range, and you are stuck in a guessing game in regard to whether he would only play the nuts this way or whether he is a fish who overvalues his hands or a las vegas gambler/bully who loves to bluff and/or put people to the money test. When you check the turn, if you are going to call a brick river like this one, why not c/r shove and put the onus back on him? Hoping you called it down and he hit an AJss that he couldn't resist betting."

Maybe decarolos could have spotted a tell on the flop after he raises. Saloman checking his hand trying to look like hes thinking. But decarolos isnt even looking at him.  Turns and river are essentially blanks.  Salomon just gets REAL lucky after that 3 bet with junk. I dont see anyone getting off that AK there. Maybe, if this wasn't 3 bet preflop and salomon got a look at a cheap flop from a blind or something. Shitty luck for decarolis. Id get up and walk away too."
poker,3bv80s,thebodonkey7,-1,Thu Jul 2 16:35:29 2015 UTC,nah river is a fold. when you call flop/turn opponent IP knows you have Ax and strong Ax as well. With AK you are calling to chop or lose to random retard hand like 8x because he isn't barreling hands you beat like AQ/AJ OTR.
poker,3bv80s,mjkelly462,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Im not so sure.  The only reasonable hand that is beating you is A8 which is highly unlikely. Would he 3 bet preflop with 89 or 78? Maybe. Id have to see a bunch more hands but its unlikely. Anything else is really out of line especially 38 and its nearly impossible to put him on that shit.  And lets not forget its a 200k call into a 600k pot. Id say with those odds, and the way the hand played out, its a call every time."
poker,3bv80s,thebodonkey7,0,Thu Jul 2 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"The only reasonable hand that is beating you is A8 which is highly unlikely.     Not at all. 68s, 87s, 89s, 8Ts, 8Js, 58s, A8s, K8s the latter because of blockers.     Anything else is really out of line especially 38 and its nearly impossible to put him on that shit.     It's impossible to put him on exactly 38; however, 3betting bad hands as bluffs is exactly why he's at that table and you aren't (no offense of course).     Id say with those odds, and the way the hand played out, its a call every time.     Its clearly a fold on the river if you are able to play on a different level. Like I said, Solomon knows when this guy or a perceived tighter player flats a 3bet OOP it has AQ/AJ/AK/QQ/JJ/TT in his range. When he calls flop and turn it is guaranteed that this player has Ax weighted towards the upper end of that range. Once Solomon barrels the river it is a fold because it is for value. This player is never folding AQ/AJ/AK on that board."
poker,3bv80s,mjkelly462,2,Thu Jul 2 20:24:34 2015 UTC,Maybe it is a fold on the river.  Its definitely not clearly a fold on the river. Its still difficult to put him on an 8 regardless on how many different ways you list the possible hands.  Does this solomon typically play pretty loose? Is a 38 three bet preflop in his range? Maybe if it is then he should have been more wary.  I dont think its an easy lay down like you make it sound.

poker,3bv80s,roamingmolecule,4,Thu Jul 2 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"As soon as I saw him I remembered this hand from the 2014 Big One for One Drop. He loses the absolute maximum against freaking vogelsang in a million dollar entry tournament by way overvaluing weak trips.   Then in the first hand of this video he gets in an all-in-on-the-flop scenario for $480,000 that I would feel foolish for in a NL10 game. Perhaps I'm jumping to conclusions based on a few hands, but it seems that he escalates situations unnecessarily and overvalues hands. That's what myself and many others tend to do when we're tilting or drunk or playing stakes far too small for our bankroll. ""Ah fuck it. I've got AQo and flopped an ace!"". That's also what severely losing players do all the time.   celebritynetworth has Rick Salomon at $30 million. So he donked off 0.7% of his net-worth in this one hand.   Who can complain though, that's awesome to see such crazy actions at those stakes. Gives us all a little glimmer of hope for mega-wealth ;)  Edit: At least later he folds KK pre to AA, but the AA raise was just ridiculous.   Edit2: At the end of the video Salomon calls with J-high on a Q-high flop saying that he was hoping for runner-runner flush or straight... Maybe he had a plan to float and bluff JRB, but..."

Rakeback Pro - if you’re really good at numbers and statistics and maybe have a short attention span (e.g. ADHD) then this is your best bet. You can work your way up to 12 tables at once, play at the reg friendly sites, break-even at the tables, but make LOTS of money in rakeback.  Shark – you do it the old fashioned way. You forget about stats and rakeback. You sit at a few tables full of fish, and you play far better poker than they do. And you make a HIGH WINRATE at every table you play. You prefer quality over quantity.  Grinder - you can choose the “happy medium”. There are some sites that do allow HUDs and have good VIP deals, but also have a good amount of fish.

A few hours into playing and a few tables over diagonally, some dude jumps up screaming with joy, he had just won the bad beat jackpot for ~$35K (AA vs KK 'xAKxK'). The guy I've been talking with is like ""heyyy that's my buddy (insert name)."" Turns out there were 5 of them there all together, so they all go and congratulate him and whatnot.    You're probably wondering what the hell I'm even going on about, cuz it's not even that interesting yet. A few minutes later, the guy that was at my table returns, grabs up his chips and says to me ""I'm coming back to get you in a couple hours, we're gonna party tonight!"" So I agree like sure, knowing he's not likely to return. A few hours passes and I'm doing well at the table, sipping on my Stella, and sure enough he returns to grab me. I pack up my chips and he tells me to bring them as we're gonna play in the suite they just rented. We get up there and the first thing I see when we get in is a naked chick walk past me. Ok that's interesting, not gonna complain. Get in and there's a bag of some white stuff, naked girl, and 5 cases of beer, and a few thousand dollars of chips on the table.     The naked chick just literally stayed naked the whole time, giving us lap dances all night, and doing things with bag of stuff off of her body parts. We did these things while drinking until the morning (I took a lot of money from them playing poker but they didn't care) until it was just me and the guy who won the money left. Before him and I left to go cash out the chips we had, he began telling me that he is a massive dealer of green stuff, and was interested in having me do that for him as they were from a few hours away and I could cover the area around where I lived at the time. Told him I'd think about it and took his number, never called and never saw them again. One of the craziest nights ever.     And in before anyone says how reckless or stupid that is of me to go to a room with these guys, I was 25 and they were like 35-40 almost all married with kids. They weren't a group of guys to be scared of.   TL;DR - Guy I was talking to at poker tables friend won bad beat jackpot, naked girl for never ending dances and body parts for lines, booze, sniffing stuff and all night cards ensued.    edit:some words"

My friend (who I didn't even know played poker) called me and asked if I wanted to play a home tournament that night. Fuck yeah, I hadn't seen live cards in forever.  It didn't take long to realize that most of these guys didn't really play a lot of poker. Your standard stuff: Minbetting 5 into a 60 chip pot, and then someone raising to 6 (1 on top) and everyone calling. When I tried to correct them, they said they never played like that before, so I just let it slide. Also a lot of ""I see your 50, and I raise you 50 more"" lol.  Anyway, so about an hour or so in, this hand comes up. A bunch of people limp in, and the flop comes T97. A guy bets small and gets a few folds and a few callers.  Turn is a blank. He bets small again and everyone calls.  River is a 5. He thinks for a second and leads out for 400 into a ~80 chip pot. Everyone folds to the button, who is staring the guy down hard. He says ""I don't believe you for some reason"" and calls the 400.  Everyone looks to the bettor and he flips over J6 and says ""Straight, bitch!""  And everyone ""ooooooh""  And I was like ""Wait, you have J high""  He said ""No, 5, 6, 7...... shit""  We look to the other guy who called the river bet, who looks down and doesn't have any cards in front of him. He said ""oh shit, I forgot I folded on the flop!""  I fucking died."

poker,3bv6dj,jajison,24,Sun Jul 5 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"A few years back I was playing the $1/2NL game at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas.  A guy at my table was playing...poorly.  He made a lot of bad decisions and donked off 3 $200 bullets in a short period of time.  After he felts his 3rd bullet he stands up and we see him move to a $2/5NL game.  It couldn't have been more than 15 minutes before we heard some commotion and it was the same guy yelling about a bad beat or something or other.  Nothing too out of the norm for a live cardroom.  He gets up from that table and walks out of the poker room.  20 minutes later he walks back into the room and sits at the one $10/20NL game running.  It couldn't have been more than 30 minutes before there was a huge commotion at his table.  The dealers told us that this same guy ran his KK into another player's AA for something like $2500 effective stacks.  After the board ran out all bricks, he asked the AA player for his money back, that it was his rent money and he couldn't lose it, and please please can we just chop the pot?  The AA player calmly explained that if he had the KK and supertilter had AA, he would have fairly paid him off, and that it was unfair for him to ask for his money back.  It was at this point that our supertilting friend grabbed his racks of chips (that were still in front of him) and attempted to sprint out of the room.  Two guys in black suits (think Agents from the Matrix, security earpieces and sunglasses, the whole bit) came out of nowhere and full-on tackled this guy.  There's chips all over the floor and this guy is full-on crying, wailing, screaming ""I can't lose this money, I'm gonna be homeless, I can't I can't please please please.""  They scooped him up and dragged him out of the room.  It was the most surreal thing I've ever seen (in a cardroom)."

My card room is upstairs from the main casino only accessible by elevator, which has a (poor excuse for a) security guard stationed in front of it to check IDs. Nobody stopped him, and somehow, less than six months later he was allowed back into the casino. He is now a regular again.   edit: I haven't yet gotten comfortable with him enough to ask his side of the story but I was always friendly with him. I don't think the casino paid the other player's all in, but I DO think the casino collected the money. I heard someone went to his house and collected on it because he lived right around the corner. was just odd of him to do something like that because he is there just about every night, all night. there must be more to it, because I've seen others get banned from the same card room for far less serious infractions (telling a floor to fuck themselves)"

I was in middle school and my best friend's dad got tickets to the quarterfinal between Brazil and the Netherlands (this was in Dallas), and they were nice enough to invite me along.  We went early to the Cotton Bowl to avoid the traffic and parking and also to check out the little fair thing they had set up outside the stadium--it was sort of like a farmer's market type thing, souvenirs, food, shit like that.  There was a giant inflatable soccer ball, probably 20 feet tall, tethered to the ground at the entrance to the fair.  That day it was kinda dreary, windy, rainy, just gross.  We're standing at this booth and I hear this commotion and this blast of wind had pulled the soccer ball off its tethers and it was bouncing down the fair like some sort of giant Katamari Damaci.

I immediately start whining and create a scene, saying I miss-clicked and I didn't mean to shove and asked the floorman to reverse the move. Floorman says no and hand must be played. Another player snap calls me off and flips over AK. I give him the dirtiest smirk ever and take down a $800+ pot.   Yes, I was a little shit."

poker,3bv6dj,wikkedwhite,19,Fri Jul 3 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"Most absurd poker ""thinking"" you have heard in a live game:   Heads up pre-flop.  Lady: I think you have aces but I call. Me: Why did you call if you think he has aces? Lady: Well, if he has aces, my 4-4 is about the same as K-K there. And there is no way I am folding K-K pre-flop.    Weirdest/funniest thing you've had happen in a cardroom?:   I was at Hollywood Park at 3AM and I get a drunk guy to my left with a really skanky chick next to him. He is raising every hand and getting called and is dropping cash fast. But for some reason the guy seems to like me and he keeps whispering to me what he's holding. Finally, i look down at Kings and he raises and I bump it up to $300. He goes all in and I call. He flips over 9-4o. Kings hold up and he starts saying to the chick, ""I thought me and him were tight"".  So he mumbles under his breath a few choice words for the next five hands. Finally, I see him get out of his chair and cock a fist. The problem for him was it seemed to take 6 seconds for him to do it, so when he finally unleashes the punch, I moved to the right and he misses, sprawls on the table and splashes everyone's chips to the left of me.  Security comes over and takes him away and the chick yells at me that I cost her the money he owed for a blow job.   Two classic 2+2 threads. Go read through them if you have a few hours to spare."

UTG then jams for 80 folded back to me and I of course call.  I table my hand and everyone goes ooooo aces.  He tables 99 and proceeds to hit quads and win the hand.  The hand is not really the interesting part.  After the hand the entire table proceeds to berate me on my play.  Tell me that if I had just checked out of the BB I would have been able to get away from the aces.  One guy then tells me ""i love people like you.  You just give money away""  I was more stunned than anything else as I proceeded to top of my stack."

I decided it was worth waiting a few to see how he played. Very next hand I am the D and he is UTG. He raises to 20 and just keeps chatting away. I end up with As10s and am the only person to call. Flop was 10,2,3 and he led out with another 20. I raised to 50 figuring he was just trying to act strong on his first hand.  He thought for a moment and shoved. After that he just went back to his conversation with the guys next to him and acted uninterested. I was just trying to replay it in my head, and figured I was beat. I asked him if he was just trying to show off on his first hand and get a good image and he told me ""I dont care about the money just do what you want.""I thought for a second and just said I can beat king high. Just wanted to see if he would react at all or anything.  He immediately stopped talking and smiling and just looked at his chips. I laughed and stood up. ""You have king high? I call"" he flipped over KQ and he just looked shocked. Board ran out and I won. He got up and walked away, and I felt like a god. Went and had a steak dinner on him."

The game there is $500 max but I was in the game for $1400 and felt perfectly fine about it.  The reason I felt fine about it was the guy in the 7 seat. He was absolutely TRASHED. Imagine the drunkest guy you've ever seen and add a liter of vodka to that. This guy was ordering 3 drinks at a time from the waitress, all doubles, and getting side drinks from the bar nearby at the same time.   So this dude had almost 3k in front. Every hand was 50-75 preflop with 5 callers. It was the most perfect table I can imagine.  One hand came up where someone made it 50, drunk guy makes it 200 and gets one caller. Flop Axx, super dry. Drunk cbets 200 and gets raised to 400. Drunk guy thinks for a second, raises to something like 1000 and asks the other guy if he wants see his cards before he calls. Guy goes uhh sure? Drunk flips up complete air and gets snapped off.  A few hands later I get 22 and call a 50 pre raise 5 ways. Flop comes 22K. I check, drunk bets 400, gets raised to 1000, I call with something like 1k behind. Drunk makes it 2000 and gets called in front of me. I'm obviously in, board runs whatever. Dude shows AQ I show my quads and drunk has total air.  At this point he was out of money. Every time he busted he kept reaching into his pockets for chips and finally all the pockets were empty. He announced he was going to the ATM. Our table recruited a volunteer to follow him to the ATM and make sure he was able to find his way back to the game.

poker,3bv6dj,tswpoker1,15,Thu Jul 2 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"I have two really good ones.  I called this the ""jack"" (removed real name for privacy) whirlwind.. basically we are playing in montreal a private 10/25 game, and im told theres an action player coming and it is going to be an absolute tornado in the room. I think, okay, I was planning to play plo, but i guess i will settle for holdem today, if the game is going to be that good.  So i sit around, theres two older business guys talking alot of sh*t with eachother, but i still dont know who the action player is for atleast an hour (insert rounders quote).   I am 200bb deep, and we get to a pot with about $500 in the middle and i have 56, flop comes 347.  I bet cheeky $25 bet, whirlwind jack ships it for 6k, i call, he shows 25 and i hold..  Ok cool. I know who the action player is now...   Fold for another 45 minutes, and get 57s in LP. UTG opens, everyone comes along, whirlwind pops it 600 (hes 20k deep), everyone calls, i flick it in cause pot odds.  flop comes the magical 689. checks to me, i bet 450 into like 3k, WWJ ships it for 11k, shows jacks i hold gg.  WWJ is decently tilted at this point, and is in a pot with the loud mouth business man.  WWJ bets 600, LMBM shoves for 7k, on an AJ5ddd board, and WWJ SNAP calls, LMBM shows AxQd, then WWJ picks up his cards in his hand, and flashes 24 of clubs like its the nuts. They agree to run it twice  sure enough, the turn is the 3 of clubs,  river is a brick on the first run out, and then the 3 of spades on the second runouts river!  WWJ and LMBM play a few more hands, together, uneventful, with LMBM absolutely going insane, then they get into a fun one, where LMBM goes 400 pre, i go 1100 with QQ, reg cold calls WWJ goes 2000, LMBM makes it 8k, i tank fold, reg tank fold WWJ shoves for like ~11k effective, lmbm starts cussing and folds pocket 9s (wtf?), and WWJ shows 87 suited.   My second story, was the ultimate slowroll.  So a little preface, in private games/higher stakes games, especially with asian people, slowrolling is encouraged and fun, so with that being said.... we're playing in the back of a poker room, alot of bets go in on a t956hhdd board, i hold KQJ5 double suited, and the player vs me shows his 87JQ.  Hearts come in on the river, and he just gets up and leaves ( he hasnt seen my hand at this point). I just sit there shaking my head, as hes leaving, and the pot hasnt been awarded after like 2 minutes cause my hand is face down. He left his phone on the table, so we know hes coming back. I have a huge grin on my face, he comes back after about 3 or 4 minutes, my hand still face down, his face up.  He starts celebrating since he figures he has won, i then show the flush, and he looks shocked for a good few seconds, then smiles and gives me a fist bump, and in broken english says ""well played"""

poker,3bv6dj,Bonesnapcall,9,Thu Jul 2 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"I don't remember who originally posted this story but it remains my all time favorite poker story. It is a long read but I guarantee the read is worth it.  I encountered an interesting dynamic at the cardroom last night, and, in addition to a being a crazy story, I think there is some unique live cash game strategy to be learned here:  I got to the poker room just after dark; it was crowded, but not packed. After hitting the cashier cage, I found my seat at one of the many active $1/$2 NLHE tables. As soon as I sat down, a fellow youngster to my immediate right grumbled ""Welcome to the table, bro. This clown (motions to an elderly black gentleman sitting across from us) has been going all-in like every hand and turning over trash.""  I thanked the guy for the heads up, and settled into my seat. Over the next half hour, I proceeded to watch the gentleman that he motioned towards play like an absolute madman. He was clearly drunk, and clearly had money to blow. His preflop raises were typically to $20 or more and he did not hesitate to shove on any flop that he so much as grazed. It should also be mentioned that every time he turned over a winner (or a few times, a bluff), he would shout ""STANKY LEG!"" and proceed to stand up and perform the Stanky-Leg. YouTube the dance if you are unfamiliar, and then imagine a frail, 70 year old black man doing it after throwing 4s/5s on the table for bottom-two. All of the dealers knew this man as Stanky-Leg and apparently he was typically a 5/10 player, though I've never seen him before. Honestly, it was a pretty entertaining table.  As any reasonable player would, I decided to just wait for my spot to either re-pop him pre or call him in position and hope to double through his aggression. He had been running over most of the table and had a stack of about $500 at this point. On the rare occasions that his shoves were called, he turned over hands like Qx suited, Ace-rag, and suited connectors, typically for nothing better than top pair. Of course, the ""good"" players at the table were berating him for playing ""such trash"". Luckily a guy on my left gave one very stern ""Don't tap the glass"" and the conversation shifted to football. Tim Tebow to be exact. Blech.  Anyway, it was probably 45 minutes after I sat down that I looked down at two bullets in middle-position. Stanky-Leg was in the big blind and I had seen him defend his blinds like a wounded animal, so I decided just to raise instead of getting tricky. I made it 15 to go (pretty standard at this point thanks to Stanky) and both he and the small blind called. Flop came A97 rainbow, Stanky bet, I shoved, SB folded and Stanky called with a ragged ace. I doubled through Stanky and offered to buy him a drink, only to find out that he had been cut off by the house. He said ""Thanks anyway, youngblood"" and gave me a fist-bump.  So, with mission accomplished and roughly $500 in front of me now, I complacently leaned back and settled in, fully prepared not to play anything less than top-ten hands for the rest of the evening. Then, it happened.  One of the ""good"" players who had been berating Stanky earlier for playing trash decides to shove pre-flop from UTG for $307. That's right.  He made some speech about how he can't seem to see any flops thanks to Stanky, so he sees no option other than to shove. It folded to Stanky, who was suddenly very serious. Like scary serious.  Stanky stacked out $307 exactly but didn't push it forward just yet. He looked up and made eye contact with the shover. ""You ain't played a hand in two hours, so I know you got aces or kings,"" Stanky declares. ""But I'll tell ya, I'm all the way live over here.""  There was an awkward moment of silence as the two stared each other down, until finally Stanky said ""Lez do it"" and pushed his stacks in with one hand. The blinds fold. Original shover turned over KK; Stanky flipped up 8d9d. The guy with KK literally let's out a howl of victory. The woman on his left says ""Good play"".  The dealer assembles the pot and the whole table watches intently as he burns one card peels off three more. The window card is the six of diamonds. Full flop is 6d7dTd. Our table goes GORILLAS. Stanky literally leaps out of his seat and screams ""STANKY LEEEEEEGGGGG"" and busts a serious move. I started laughing like a small child on Christmas morning, as did most of the table, save of course for homeboy with KK, who couldn't be saltier. He hadn't said a word and was just sitting with fists clenched, staring at the board in disbelief.  As though it mattered, the dealer burned and turned one more. Adding insult to injury, it was a king. The table this time let out a group ""OHHH"" as we all briefly sympathized with what's-his-face. Even the dealer tilted his head a bit, as though he was slightly pained by the cards he had dealt. With two raps on the felt, the dealer burns one and shows us the river. The table goes silent. It's the case king.  Just when I thought that the guy with KK was gonna take his beat like a pro and quietly re-buy, he proves me wrong. ""JEEEEZUS CHRIST!"" he belts out, ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT?!? I MAKE THE PERFECT PLAY AND HE FLOPS A FUCKING STRAIGHT FLUSH, THEN I RUN QUADS?!?! GOD DAMMIT!.."" A supervisor appeared behind him and tapped him on the shoulder. ""Sir,"" he said, ""you need to relax.""  Steaming, but not stupid, the man shut up. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two crisp Franklins to re-buy. Another supervisor came over and informed Stanky that he had just won the high-hand for the hour, which ended right after the crazy hand did. The supervisor then handed Stanky $750 cash.  Stanky turns to the table and announces ""Guess what? I'm buyin' all y'all muhfuggas a drank!... Except for you!"" He points at the man who had KK.  Still visibly furious, the man retorted ""And why is that?""  Stanky leaned back, finished piling his chips into loose stacks and said quite succinctly ""Because you a whiny bitch.""  I'm not sure if there is a moral to this story or whether it's just one of the craziest things I've ever seem in a cardroom. I guess my takeaway is: pick your spots, and don't be a whiny bitch. Guys like Stanky-Leg aren't at the table every night, you have to capitalize when they are. And if you ever run quads after someone flops a straight flush in your eye, take it like a man. Otherwise, you may cost yourself some respect, or more importantly, a free drink."

But it did happen, exactly like this:  I have been waiting three years for the right time to tell this tale. You and I both being bored at work seems like the right time.   This is the story of the Greatest Hand of Poker I've Ever Played:  The Location: Saloon #10 Casino - Deadwood, SD The Game: $6-$12 Spread-Limit Hold 'Em  The Story: Four years ago, I was in Deadwood for St. Patrick's Day weekend. I spent all day cleaning out the ""big game,"" which was $3-$25 Spread Limit. I have a MOUNTAIN of chips in front of me while I clean out the last of the fish. I am sitting in the exact chair where Wild Bill Hickock was supposedly shot in the back while holding Aces & Eights. (Spoiler Alert: I am not holding that hand.)  There is a rule in place at this, and many other casinos, that you can enter a table with more than the table max, if your higher table was broken up. This is the case as I crack the last drunken degenerate at the ""big"" table.  So when my table breaks, they move me to the next biggest table, which was $6-$12. I have more chips in front of me when they seat me, than every other player put together. It looks ridiculous..true chip porn. And this is a table of absolute ROCKS. There's a couple thousand on the table, and the table equity was about six cents. The Greatest Hand I Ever Played was the first and only hand I played at the $6-$12 rock table.  I get seated, and I start ordering drinks. Keep in mind, it's St. Patrick's Day, I'm Irish, and I've been drinking and playing cards all day and night. I am drunk as hell, but the sort of drunk only the Irish seem to have mastered: not swaying, not quite slurring, but otherwise very, very inebriated. Also, my wife was with me, and I was teaching her poker. This will be important in just a minute. .. So I order a drink, and the dealer deals to the now-full table. I am on the button. I am ordering drinks, and now shots, and the betting comes back to me. I explain to my wife that, since eight people ahead of me limped in, that I am correct in calling blind, based on pot odds. Yes, I could have looked, and possibly been right to raise, but I was drunkenly proving a point. Sue me.  Then, the small blind, a 600-pound biker from Sturgis, raises, instead of limping. Seven calls in front of me. I giggle to my wife that, mathematically, I still have to call, even though I still haven't looked at my hole cards.  The flop comes 6-6-3. Small blind bets, UTG raises, and five callers. Still drunkenly laughing, I explain that I still have to call blind. Small blind then reraises, UTG caps, five callers. Naturally, I drunkenly giggle out a call. That's when our drinks arrived. As I am tipping the waitress/ordering more shots/feeling up my wife, the dealer flips the turn: 10  Small blind bets $12, UTG raises, three callers. Shit. Now I have to look, since we are on the big bets. I look at my hole cards...K K. I 3-bet raise, small blind caps it, two callers. I figure, crap, one of em has a six, but I'm drunk and on a heater, so I call the 4-bet. Then our shots arrive. Keep in mind, this is a full table in a packed casino on a holiday weekend, so everything takes a while. I down my shot.  River...K.  Small blind bets, UTG raises, one folds, then I reraise. Small blind gets sad and makes the crying call, as does UTG. I flip my cards and say ""kings full.""  You could have heard a mosquito fart, it got so quiet. I look over to the mountaing giant/biker to my left. He's just staring at me in disbelief. I figure he's gonna want to eat me, but I'm drunk so I've forgotten how to fear. After a really long pause, he just looks at me, and in this 5-year-old-kid's voice, he just mumbles ""but...but...but you called blind!"" ""I know, buddy. Poker's crazy. You want a shot?"" ""Okay. I need one :(""  I did one shot with him, and it took three hands for me to even get all the chips stacked. I left, never to return.  Sadly, I realize that that giant ball of Harley leather is telling this story as frequently as I do, but his version ends very, very badly.  tl/dr: But...you called blind..."

poker,3bv6dj,Mendoza2909,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:11:55 2015 UTC,"I'll try the math:  Pre-flop: 9 x 6.00, four-bet capped, = $216 Flop: Seven called the capped board for $24, two for 2 bets, so $192 Turn: Five called for $48 cap, plus two for $24, so $264 River: Two callers for caps at $48, one for  $12 and fold, for $108 Plus blinds, equals $789, minus rake, I guess?  Edit: Potato math"
poker,3bv6dj,pissclamato,8,Sat Jul 4 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"Mine isnt about a hand itself, just a situation i found myself in from playing poker.   was robbed at gun point   Couple of things to keep in mind: two gunmen involved and two people running the game who both lived there. I bought in short stacked for the game at $300. Game was full so at a minimum there was $3,000 on the table but I would say it was 7-8 In actuality.  PART1- The game- First time at a new game. A guy I had played with at a local casino and another home again was running his home game. I didn’t really want to go as I was supposed to pick up my sister from a concert, Jimmy Buffet I believe. This was a few years ago, three maybe four in cincinnait. Well I decided to go. Figured I could at least catch part of the lakers vs suns playoff game. After waiting for an hour or so for a seat I decide its time to leave. At this point a guy jumps up from the table and says you can have my seat- So I say sure, maybe I can make 50 bucks or so to make it worth my time. I do just that in the 10 hands I played. Im about to leave, Im under the gun( literally just now realized the Pun here), last hand im going to play and two guys come in with masks guns pointed in all directions. The entire table starts laughing, we all think it’s a joke. At this point one of them demand the money but somehow no one knows where it is. The burley lumberjack at the table immediately puts his hands up-so we all do the same- which is funny because “put your hands up” is what cops say. But here we are willingly putting our hands up for these guys who didn’t even ask. So Guy #1 wearing a yellow bandana goes right up to the guy running the game and pistol whips him in the nose (evidence someone on the inside was in on it. There were at least 15 ppl there and he knew exactly who to go for). The dog in the house actually jumped on the masked man at this point which in hind site was hilarious because he then turned the gun on the dog and started acting like the coward he was. He was yelling “get this dog off of me, man, I hate dogs” a few people start saying “ don’t shoot the dog!” Good news, he didn’t shoot the dog and the original guy who invited me put the dog in the bathroom. At this point guy number #2, white bandana, is standing directly behind me with the another gun pointed at my head, Im thinking great, this is how im going to go out, typical wallymomouth. After several moments the guy empties his pockets they get the money and leave. We call the cops. They come take our statements and names, yadda yadda. I was only about 3 hours late to pick up my sister and I was nervous as you could imagine( my nervousness is important to note here.) I had lied to my mom as to where I was which didn’t help. There was a bad beat jackpot at this place with like 6 grand in it, so we were all pretty certain we were going to get our money back. I had another friend there, told him to collect my money when he left but that I desperately had to leave now. On the way to get my sister I got pulled over by another cop about 2 minutes after I left. He was obviously looking for suspects, he tried to give me some random BS reason he pulled me over- I explained to him I was at the poker game that just got robbed, he confirmed with one of the cops still there. So he let me leave.  PART 2- My suspicion About six months after all this has passed. I see the guy who ran the game at Hollywood casino in Indiana. He comes up and apologies again as this is the first time he has seen me since it happened. He then goes “I have a funny story I need to tell you.” He’s like, you may have not known this but you were the suspect for the first couple months and the cops even tapped your phone line. I half heartedly laugh thinking hes joking and he goes on to explain. The guys who robbed the place were heroin addicts who knew a guy named wallymomouth as well who played at the game. He was in on it but wasn’t there that night. Gunman #1 made a plan to kill the guy who supplied the guns. Word got out on the street who robbed the place. And the people in on it all thought it was the gun supplier. So Gunman1 says to his roommate and his girlfriend (who neither were drug addicts or a bad people for that matter) that if he needs his help disposing a body not to ask questions. They both go to the cops and turn this guy in. The girlfriend knows the whole story and explains everything to the cops. Particularly important, that wallymomuth was the person who set this up. However she didn’t know his last name. So the cops call up the guy running the game, and say how well do you know wallymomouth, he was at the game that night and we have his information. He says well, I mean I trust the guy, I don’t know him too well, but I trust him. But at the same time he was really anxious to leave which was kind of suspicious. The cops basically convinced him that it was me that put it all together. Well after a couple months the cops finally bring the girlfriend in for questioning again. They want her to identify my picture. She looks at it and immediately says that’s not the wallymomouth im talking about. So im off the hook, the hook I didn’t even know I was on.  Part 3- The conviction The cops get everyone involved. Five people total I believe. The two gunmen, the getaway driver, another guy in the car and the other wallymomouth. They only ended up taking about 500 bucks from us( I think we told the cops several thousand), out of all the money at the game. The guy had not yet put the money I bought in for and another 200 dollars with the rest of the stash. So when he gave them the money, they didn’t ask questions and just bolted out of there not realizing there was another stash of money. After all said and done the five of them got sentenced collectively to 26 or 28 years in prison."

poker,3bv6dj,MrMogz,3,Thu Jul 2 16:41:23 2015 UTC,"A $700+ pot at my 25¢/50¢ cash game I used to host at my house, that remains, to this day, the craziest hand I've EVER seen play out.  I'm 1st to act and look down at AA. I know my table it full of maniacs to I just throw out a greasy buck (common for me to just min raise with everything) and see what happens.  2 down from me Raises to $7. The Button re-raises to $25. The BB raises all in for $155. I go all in for about 260. 2 down from me only has like $60 left and likes his odds with lot of action so he goes all in. Which leaves the Button.  ""Oh Jimmy... you are the only fly in my ointment"". I said ""Really, how so"". Well he said I'm sitting on a pair of Queens... and I would call all these guys in a heartbeat.. but I know you don't make the move you just made unless you have Aces or Kings"".  ""I can see how that makes it difficult for you"". ""You gonna tell me?"" (we allowed this kind of talk at my home game) ""I can't tell you pal. We have others all in for this pot and I can't influence play on their pot.""  He tanks for a minute or 2 and the BB calls clock on him. He goes ""Fine"" I call.  3rd position shows 88 the Button shows his QQ (telling the truth) BB shows KK (looking pleased) .. and I show AA and everyone awaits the flop.  The other cash tables (I used to run 3 at once) all get up to see the flop.   8 - ""OOOOH!"" Q - ""OOOOOHHHHHHH!!!"" A - ""OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"" ""HOLY SHIT!""   Turn brings an A to give me quads and ends all suspense.   I've still never seen another hand play out like that one where 4 started with a pocket pair. 3 of them made a set on the flop and then quads for me on the turn."

So the hand before the gross one this drunk guy celebrating his birthday takes a decent pot off of buddy to my left, leaving him with about $20 bucks. Next hand. Both me and the drunk guy have between 8-900 in front of us. I'm in SB short stack bro is BB and drunk guy is UTG+1. He limps, I complete with Jh-kd and BB checks. Us three see the flop and the Flop comes 10d-Jd-Jc I check, BB goes all in for his last 20 and then drunk guy commits a big mistake. He says, ""I'll go all in with you"". I think about it for a few seconds but I'm fully aware he made a mistake and didn't want to shove 800 into the pot there. I call and he immediately realizes what he did. He said he didn't even notice I was in the hand, but it was too late. He practically insta mucked his hand before the turn and river were dealt. He just wanted to give the BB some money back from the hand before but accidently threw 800 down the drain. I took down the 1600+ side pot and BB took down 60ish when his flush draw got there. The guy kept his cool in the room but apparently he lost his mind after and got kicked out twice. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.

So to put some perspective on this story I was just getting into poker. I was only 16 at the time and the only experience I had no experience playing live which is mostly soft, however there is one player with over $100k in live winnings who is mostly there for the social aspect of the game (as he plays much higher stakes). All I had read on the subject is Super/System's section on NLHE. But that gave me heart. These guys in their 30s-40s all thought they could push me around. Rich, a fairly fishy player (I know that now, didn't know it then) had turned to my dad after he saw me at the table and said ""So you're teaching him the game, huh?"" Jerk. We start playing, it's tournament style NLHE. I as Brunson had told me to be, was incredibly and relentlessly aggressive. I 3-bet pre with A-K suited and got two callers very early, shoved a 3-rag flop and took it town. Chuck, the very good player I mentioned earlier, laughed and said ""Kid poker!"" From there on I was very aggressive and I was getting lucky, I busted Rich with a pair of aces, I remember later that night saying something almost directly out of Super/System and him responding with ""... I think he's read Doyle's book."" There was also this. I raised by dad off a pot and then:  Chuck: ""How does it feel to have raised a bully?""  Dad: ""He raised me!""  Chuck(shaking his head): ""How does it feel to have brought up a bully?""  But the best moment in the night was this. We were four handed at the time and I was heads-up against Chuck, easily the best player I've ever played against and once again he has $100k in live winnings and is a very solid player. It's a blind v. blind confrontation. I wake up with Ah9h in the SB and raise to 4x. He calls. This represents about 1/5th of my stack by the way. The flop comes with two hearts and no ace. I check, planning a check raise. Chuck checks behind. The turn is a brick. I check, Chuck bets half the pot. I call. The river pairs the board. I check, Chuck bets the pot. I have ace-high and I tank with it. I dig into every single piece of poker media I had consumed, I looked at Chuck, I thought about his betting patterns, I thought about how he knew about how I was generally an aggressive player when I had it. And somehow, against this far superior player, I found it within me to call the double barrel bluff with ace high for almost all that I had left. After I called he grabbed his card and said ""Nice call."" I showed the ace-high and he mucked his hand and took it down. I took down the tournament and Chuck afterwards told me that my game was strong and gave me some suggestions on books I should read to improve it. I am a much better player now and poker is my passion."

poker,3bv6dj,DrWormwaffle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Went to my local bar with a friend of mine two nights ago to just have a large number of beers. We play some pool and one of the eastern european slot degenerates walks over and asks to play the winner for a a couple of beers. I aggree as my poolgame is a bit of a hustle. I destroy him 4 times and he claims I should play poker with him since this is more of his game.  He´s drunk and I think I should have a decent edge against a 50 year old drunk, whos wife is home in Serbia, who won a few hundred euros once and now thinks he´s Ivey himself. He runs home to get cards and I cash out 50 euros to play with him HU for rollz. After a lengthly explanation of what a blind is we start and friendly .2/0.5 game. After 20 hands or so I am up a 100 and he keeps reloading. The most passive whale I´ve ever seen and I feel like the reincarnation of Cpt. AHAB. I mean he calls everything on the river with 8 high or bottom pair and I just started folding to any bet and 4x pot with middle pair. I was on a heater for sure, but this guy was clueless. He got so mad, when he thought he won a 10bb pot, but we chopped the board (9 high on a AQTAQ board). We played some 0.5/1 and I won some more. When I tried to leave he got sketchy and wanted play on and put 200 euros more on the table. Left 20 min later with overall 280 up. Fun night all together!"
poker,3bv6dj,Backdo0r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"I used to play a lot in Sheffield at the Grosvenor there.  Every few months, around the big international snooker tournaments and qualifiers, I'd be playing poker with players like Steve Davies, Ken Doherty, Ronnie O'sullivan (only 1 night!  Very loose.  Steve d was a NIT), and a few others that wandered down from time to time.  Steve actually cashed the WSOP a number of years ago, which he said all he did was fold, and from the way he played I 100% believe him :D  They were all kind enough to sign photos to my dad for his 60th birthday present.  Oh because sheffield was a student city you'd get a lot of them in on the weekends during semester.  There was one occasion where this guy put a pound down on 16 and it came up, he went MENTAL, to the point we thought he'd won a jackpot or something.  £32 bang on!  Every friday and saturday night they'd host a £5 unlimited re-buy that was self-dealt.  That place was such a minefield, and it wasn't uncommon for some of these players to belt in £100 or more in re-buys.  I took it down twice for some tidy sums.  The cash was also very popular with the Asian crowd who were crazy but very predictable.  The best hand of my life I made £400 at a £1 / £1 table with £300 behind me after going well.  I then get into a 3 way pot with two Asians who are massive, massive gamblers, drunk as fuck,  and clumsy so I could easily see one of the guys cards that was closest to me.  They both have about £200 behind.  I get 99 in position and raise 3bbs and get these two coming along, both looking at their hands and laughing.  Flop is AhKc4h, I see the guy next to me has 56 off as he's shit at protecting his cards.  I make a pot sized bet and get two calls, the turn is the 8d.  56 boy leads out for ... £40 what?!  They chat in their language and the dealer tells them to speak english, then translates for everyone at the table because she can (handy!) the guy said ""you're drawing so i bet big!  you should fold!"" the other guy basically is so drunk he can barely concentrate, so he's laughing and nodding because his mate has him right, and he's finding the fact hilarious.  He calls and says ""ill get there and you wont!"".  I call, as there is a 100% chance that they're moving all in on the river, so I can get out of the way if it's a danger card.  The river comes, 2s, they move all in and I call and immediately flip my 9's over.  They, for some reason, stopped finding it so funny and left!  I did offer to buy them a beer to try and keep them but they weren't interested..."
poker,3bv6dj,Mildcorma,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"This isn’t a bad beat, big win or super awesome degen story, but it is one of my most memorable poker stories that some of you might find interesting.   Spring of 2014 I got a job as a QA game tester at BioWare in Edmonton. It was a temp job working on their last big project, Dragon Age: Inquisition. The company is really cool place to work and they treat all of their employees really well with lots of perks to keep the drones happy. Anyways, a few of the long time employees ran a bi-monthly poker game in one of the rec rooms at the offices. The company supported this by building Bioware themed custom poker tables and producing a Bioware themed custom chip set. If you know the games they make, you wouldn’t be surprised that the biggest denom chip was of course Commander Shephard. Anyways, it was a great setup for an informal company event.   I was only a few days away from leaving for another job when I played one last tournament there. It was very relaxed as always and during the first break I chatted with a few of the regular employees, they talked about traveling and one of them mentioned going to Peru and Bhutan on different vacations. I didn’t recognize him, but it’s a big office and I only interacted with a smaller team most of the time. Once the action got going again that same guy was sitting to my right with a short to mid-sized stack. He was shoving at least once an orbit to steal blinds and stay afloat, but for the most part seemed card dead. Finally he shoves on my button and I wake up with KK, which holds and knocks him out of the tourney. He shakes my hand and gracefully walks out.   At the next break some one asks where Ray went? Another person points to me and says, “eggson knocked him out and he left.” Someone else asks me, “you know who that was, right?” I had no clue. A bunch of people chime in, “That was Ray Muzyka, one of the founders of BioWare. He’s worth $80 million!” I was like, oh, good thing I already put my two-weeks notice in!”  I ended up bubbling in 5th place, but it was a really fun night and no I didn’t get fired.  tl;dr: lowly temp worker knocks millionaire founder out of company poker tournament."
poker,3bv6dj,eggson,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Ray Muzyka:       Ray Muzyka is a Canadian investor, entrepreneur and physician. Originally trained as a medical doctor and practicing as an emergency room and family physician after graduation, he is the co-founder of video game developer BioWare, and was CEO, senior vice president, and general manager of the BioWare label of Electronic Arts (comprising BioWare Edmonton, BioWare Austin, BioWare Montreal, BioWare Ireland, BioWare Victory, BioWare San Francisco, BioWare Sacramento and Mythic Entertainment).   In October 2012 he announced that he was embarking on a 'third career' mentoring and investing in technology, new media, medical and social entrepreneurs, and impact investing at ThresholdImpact.

We get 7 limps, 8 players to a flop.   467r flop. checks all around. K turn. checks all around. 4 river. EP shoves all in for ~600, folds to LP who snap calls.  EP turns over 85, for the flopped straight. LP turns over 64, for the rivered boat.   The idea of an open shove, after 2 streets of checking, into a $40 pot was hilarious."

Friend of mine was playing in a wsop circuit event when he got involved in a hand. Guy mucks his hand, then mentions to the dealer what he had. She says, ""oh you had a straight then!"" Then the dealer digs through the muck to pull out his cards. My friend obviously complains to the floor and they agree with the dealer.   Played in my first wsop event in Vegas a few weeks ago. Played solid all day and the moment the announcer says over the mic that we'll be playing our last 3 hands, I look down at pocket kings. Ran into rockets so I was eliminated less than 10 people from cashing on my first attempt. No big deal but I still think about it a lot."
poker,3bv6dj,jaewizz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"Playing my first real tournament in a casino. Low stakes - $65 buy in. I'm a young woman and tend to generally play super friendly with everyone at the table, mostly because it's a bunch of men most of the time and it definitely puts them off their guard.   This older guy - probably in his mid-60s, goes head to head with me. I bust him out. He goes and re-buys - literally comes back to the table 2 minutes later, goes head to head with me on the next hand (I have AK, he has 22) and I bust him again. He was ... SO pissed. Slammed his fists on the table, cursed at me. I just smiled and kept sipping my seltzer. Finished 2nd overall. That's when I got the bug.   I don't know why, but there's something so satisfying in taking down several tables of men who ask me questions like ""are you killing time while your husband plays craps?"" and then laugh uproariously together. Their delicious rage tears when I take their chips 20 minutes later are like sweet honey."

poker,3bw3sk,Touch_Of_Red,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"Obviously it's dispersed since winning a comp is ridiculous variance. The figures obviously correlate. Why would they not lol.  I know comps aren't winner takes all, this bet is winner takes all, if you bet 800:1 on Selbst and she gets 2nd then you get fuck all.  Why am I getting down voted lol"
poker,3bw3sk,BerryGuns,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:39:12 2015 UTC,Interesting. Maybe I'm underestimating how tough the field is in relation to the elite pro's. I thought 800/1 was short for sure but I didn't think it was short by that much!
poker,3bw3sk,BerryGuns,6,Thu Jul 2 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yea but it's a tourney, she'd have to almost have 10:1 edge on the field for that price which obv is ridiculous"
poker,3bw3sk,MathW,2,Thu Jul 2 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"Negreanu is favourite, best price 175/1 lol  Ivey is as short as 40/1 in places!"
poker,3bw3sk,Stevenab87,3,Thu Jul 2 17:33:56 2015 UTC,Are these odds to win?   Because 175 to 1 is a laughable bet for any player to take down a 6k person tournament.
poker,3bw3sk,MathW,3,Thu Jul 2 17:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they are and yes, they are atrocious odds."
poker,3bw3sk,tswpoker1,2,Thu Jul 2 18:41:32 2015 UTC,"LOL holy hell! 40/1 is beyond bonkers. The maximum edge anyone can have in this thing is 10x better then some random stranger, imo. So best player in the field is 600/1 at absolute best against an entire field of total donks. I should start accepting bets at these crazy prices."
poker,3bw3sk,BerryGuns,2,Thu Jul 2 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the toughness of the field as much as the randomness and variance of tournaments.     For instance, top MTT grinders might sustain a 70-100% ROI over a large sample. ..they can expect to win 7 to 10 bucks for every 10 bucks they pay in entries.   If we translate that into edge over the field, you can probably assume a top tournament player has twice as much chance of winning as the average player in a tournament.  Even if we assume the ME field is full of worse than average players, I don't see how this edge is better than 200%.  Therfore, any player over 2000 to 1 is a losing play IMO.  I'm not sure how the odds are offered, but if they 100 pros listed at various prices and a ""the field"" bet for the rest of the players at something like 4 to 1, take the field every time."
poker,3bw3sk,tswpoker1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:55:24 2015 UTC,Doesn't this rationale imply that every player in the field has an equal chance of winning?  Because obviously that is simply not the case.  Assuming a completely random table draw you would think that Selbst should have an edge.
poker,3bw3sk,MathW,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:52 2015 UTC,I've given her a 2:0 edge on the field lol it's massive

poker,3bw3sk,Touch_Of_Red,2,Thu Jul 2 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no one has anywhere near an 8 to 1 edge. ..these look like sucker bets."
poker,3bw3sk,Stevenab87,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:25:33 2015 UTC,I won't be having a bet. I knew the odds were below the true odds but I wasn't sure just how far out they were. Thanks everyone :)
poker,3bw3sk,curehead,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'd take 800:1 on any top MTTer.  Now if I was actually betting, I'd probably do something like take a grouping of 100 players at 8:1 overall.  I'm not saying it's a great bet, but it's going to be pretty decent sweat and fairly close to breakeven as a top MTTer is going to win a FAR higher % of the time than an average player in the ME is.  And, like you asked, there are going to be a fair number of people who just are too passive to have any realistic shot at winning."

From that list, assuming you are betting on bet365, I'd say Binger/Chino/Clements/Racener/Boeken/Takeover/Bonomo/Baldwin/Cantu/Selbst/Mizzi/Medic/Seiver are worth a min bet sweat.

poker,3bv2lk,HALF-n-HALF,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:29 2015 UTC,"Regi you nit ;P   I only watched half but you didn't play that bad tbh - got good value when you needed, didn't hold on to hands when it looked like you were behind, etc. I think you need to work on your preflop hand ranges though. There are definitely a few spots where you could have seen flops that you passed up on.   For example, it folded to you on the BTN and you folded KK68 double suited (IIRC). In PLO, you can open extreeeemely wide in LP, especially on the zoom tables. Even if you get a called, KKxx is often slightly ahead and you'll be able to flop something good or get him to fold with a cbet on a dry board. There was another instance where MP opened and you folded KQ58 double suited on the button. Your opening range should obviously be looser than your calling range preflop but I think you can afford to see flops with hands like these, especially in position because position in PLO is even more important than in hold em.  So yea, I know you're used to playing pretty tight in hold em but you can definitely loosen up and see more flops; I'm a winning player at the $5 and $10 PLO zoom tables and I'm running a 33/21/9, so don't be afraid to go wild and play a little looser. Your fundamental concepts are good enough to let you loosen up a bit.  There were also a couple good bluffing instances you passed up on but those will come with time and are harder to spot when you're just starting out in PLO. Good video though, keep up the good work and see you on the zoom tables"

MP2 has almost 9BB, and is not desperate enough to be shoving super wide. Maybe you know they play 50/40/25 and could have 78o here but I don't think the average player in this game is like that.  If you give MP2 a range of:  A8+, A2s-A5s, 22+, KTo+, QJo+ QTs+, K9s+ then you have 48% equity. I am not saying that they have exactly this range, this is just what I plugged in as an example.  You also have to worry about the 3 other players recramming. This doesn't happen very often but when it does you are in pretty bad shape.  I don't see much reason to flip for 40% of our stack here (though I don't think recramming is terrible)  TLDR: fold pre.  EDIT: I just had a look at the nash shoving ranges for MP2, and yes, villain should be cramming 87s. I underestimated that.  But IIRC people in this level of SNG tend not to be that shove happy and are shoving less than they should be with 9BB. I definitely do not expect the average player to shove 87s here."

poker,3bwxy0,MathW,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"Probably a bit different for everyone but,  in general for no limit, your win rate probably starts falling for every table you add after 2-4.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't play more than that because, if you're playing for the money, your goal should be to maximize your $ per hour.   So, assuming 100 hands per table per hour, winning 3bb/100 playing 8 tables (24 bb/hour) is better than winning 8bb/100 playing 2 tables (16 bb/hour).  If you're playing for fun or to learn, then your goals will be different and it may be better to play on just 1 or a few tables."

poker,3bu9py,RegiTime,2,Fri Jul 3 02:09:16 2015 UTC,"Have you considered purchasing some affordable microstakes coaching :p  Yours is a pretty common story and probably more common than you actually think.  The good news is, when starting from a relatively weak position, it's not too difficult to start making some pretty big improvements once you figure out what you're doing wrong.  That sounds incredibly simplistic but it's true.   Many players I work with have made huge initial strides that have then reinvigorated them and given them a self belief that they haven't felt before which sets them quickly on the path to becoming a winning player.  I feel I do my best work with players like you that are getting a decent amount right but are probably just missing a few pieces of the jigsaw. I enjoy helping already winning players fine tune their games but I absolutely love turning a losing player into a winning player.  This isn't me pushing my services on you by the way. I am fully aware that paying for coaching is beyond the budgets of many nanostakes players(even at my prices)I'm just trying to encourage you and say that maybe your games isn't quite as far away from being ok right now as you think it is."
poker,3bu9py,RegiTime,2,Thu Jul 2 10:25:43 2015 UTC,Well looking at your flair you will of course recommend yourself. But what coaches do you recommend for microstakes and what is the price range.  (Feel free to pm the skype details aswell)
poker,3bu9py,RegiTime,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:27:59 2015 UTC,"My rates are $35 for one hour but drop to $28ph for anyone looking to take 5 sessions in a prepaid package.  I'm not aware of too many other coaches that are as competitively priced as that.   I know a handful of other microstakes coaches that work differently to me and are better than me at working with intermediate players, helping them learn more about how to survive and prosper in tougher games but because I haven't worked with them personally, I wouldn't be too comfortable making any recommendations."

poker,3bu9py,krownroyal83,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I have some books I'm going to re-read, and review my poker sessions in poker tracker.    I can see the biggest, most obvious shortcoming in my game: not folding to obviously better hands, and overplaying shitty hands.  I need to get it ingrained in my head that not everybody is bluffing when they raise me. And if they check-raise me, they probably have a monster that they're slow playing so I should probably fold my top pair.  It's a funny psychology about the bluffing. I have such a distrust of people in my average daily life, that it causes me to play with a belief people are bluffing when it seems often they are not.    I'll keep you in mind if I get beyond the books and reviewing my play, and still find myself losing.  Though I'll probably end up going onto something else and trying again in 2019."

poker,3bung4,_limitless_,3,Thu Jul 2 08:02:18 2015 UTC,Awesome results thus far.   I have a few questions as a guy that dreamed of trying this but never tried.   1) why heads up?   2) arent you worried someone you are playing against sees your twitch feed?  3) what did you do back in the early 2000s to get this good? just playing read anything in particular or just hitting the tables for hours on end?  4) what did you do for this run to be prepared for the overall change in poker play?
poker,3bung4,karasz816,2,Thu Jul 2 08:15:17 2015 UTC,"1) Heads up is like chess. Knowing when to polarize a range and when to merge it, and doing that across every action for both players 5 or 6 times a hand... that's what I'm here for. 9max is a lot less complicated; lines are more polarized more often, which is easy to play against.  2) We run an 8 minute delay. We started with a 2 minute delay, and we were being sniped. It didn't help them in the current hand, but they were picking up the reads I was making live before I could find a way to stop them... that's really, really bad heads up. 8 minutes feels like the sweet spot; my strategy has probably already changed by then. Most importantly though is to play good poker -- have a mixed strategy with most hands, or a balanced strategy on most boards. (These are game theory terms with specific meanings -- I won't go into explaining here)  3) I watched a lot of DeucesCracked videos, read a stack of books taller than I am, contributed to 2+2, and most importantly, I solved the spots myself. I did a lot of work with StoxEV (now FlopZilla).   4) Nothing. I've always believed that there has been no real change in poker play. This was one of the things I set out to prove with the challenge. I noticed a couple of new lines that have evolved, particularly, the river overbet jam with nuts/nothing. That's pretty modern. Also, 3betting pocket pairs, that rarely happened in the old days; people just setmined. But although it's not a popular opinion to have, the fact is, there were a combination of nits, lags, and stations 10 years ago too -- some with 10 years of experience who were still bad, and some playing their first game of poker. That hasn't changed."
poker,3bung4,MathW,2,Thu Jul 2 08:44:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I thought I was going crazy thinking I was the only one who thought the low stakes game hasn't changed dramatically.    I was a low stakes grinder in the mid 2000s.  Compared to then, the average player may be a bit better and a bit more aggressive, and there might be better/more optimal ways to play which have evolved at the highest skill levels,  but that does not apply to 99% of people playing low/micro stakes.  Poker books and advice which helped you beat low limit games in 2005 will still help you beat low limit games in 2015.  If you were a 10bb/100 winner then,  you will probably still be a winner now (albeir, probably a bit lower rate )without much change in your style of play."

poker,3bwn0n,mattz12,7,Thu Jul 2 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"In a cash game, folding AA pre is effectively never correct.  In tournaments, an overwhelming majority of the time folding AA pre is not correct. The few times it is correct:  1) We expect to win X_1 chips Y% of the time and lose X_2 chips (100-Y)% of the time (ignoring chops)  2) Chips relative to stack sizes translate to $ from the prize pool  3) The money we expect to gain when we win X_1 chips, which happens Y% of the time, is less than the money we expect to lose when we lose X_2 chips, which happens (100-Y)% of the time  Basically, we expect to lose money, even though we always expect to win chips. This concept is a result of ICM  Edit: Here's a simple article explaining ICM: ICM and a follow-up"
poker,3bwn0n,duskhat,5,Thu Jul 2 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all of those comments are being sarcastic.  It's making fun of a post that got a lot of attention in a /r/askreddit thread a couple weeks ago. I actually briefly went through your user history to make sure you weren't being sarcastic as well, haha. There's a lot of that on this subreddit that would be hard to detect for someone that doesn't play a lot of poker.   It's almost never correct to fold AA preflop in no limit holdem.  And never correct in a cash game.  The only reason I say ""almost never"" is because of the following example.  Let's say you're in a tournament where the top %x of the field all gets the same prize (like a seat to a bigger tournament) and you're already guaranteed a spot.  You can just fold every hand and get your prize.  If you go all in preflop in this extremely rare scenario you have a chance to lose that ""guaranteed"" spot you already have."
poker,3bwn0n,Stixx_27,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"Sometimes in a satellite tournament all the prizes are the same, you either survive or you don't.  If you already have a large stack and are very strongly guaranteed to win a prize, you should fold aces preflop if another big stack or two get all in in front of you.  That is literally the one situation in which you should fold aces pre."
poker,3bwn0n,Infinitezen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:56 2015 UTC,Folding aces pre is something that should never be done. The only exception would be the final table of the WSOP main event or another hugh event and say everyone had roughly the same amount of chips and they all went in ahead of you. I'd gladly fold in that spot to almost guarantee my self an extra 4 to 5 million dollar pay day.

Fold aces in a tournament when   multiple people go all in and you'll move up in the money (final table scenario). If you have chips to give away on a bad beat then call without hesitation. Actually, just always call with aces unless theres a bunch of people going all in.

poker,3bwn0n,Stixx_27,-8,Fri Jul 3 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"Alright bro. You call an entire table's all in with pocket aces and let me know how that turns out. Poker Gods do not favor aces in those situations. You have to set EV to the side for a moment and think this:  Do I really want to call 6 people going all in with my aces KNOWING that I don't have the same odds as going heads up, and I'm probably going to lose.  OR  You fold, and put your money all in at a better spot.  If I go to Vegas and buy in to a table with $400, I'm not going to call an all in because I don't want to have to buy in again for $400 and risk a bad beat on my next buy in, because then I'm in the hole 2 buyins. What is the ceiling for you? Are you going to call an all in with a $1000? $10? Everyone has their limits."
poker,3bwn0n,Witcrew,5,Thu Jul 2 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"Practice better bankroll management then. Obviously you're playing too high if you're talking about setting EV aside which is retarded. AA is near 50% to win against 5 random hands, and similar against 5 hands with a top 25% range.  If you can't afford to lose a bunch of flips in a row when you're getting 6:1 on your money you shouldn't be playing in that game."

poker,3bwn0n,duskhat,2,Thu Jul 2 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"You have to set EV to the side for a moment and think this:   A good poker player never sets ""EV to the side"".     Do I really want to call 6 people going all in with my aces    Yes!  Hell yes.   To explain, even though you have less than a 50% chance to win.  If there are 6 people in the pot that all put in equal money, you don't have to have 50%+ to have it be a profitable situation.  You just have to have greater than a 1/6 chance of winning the pot, which if you have AA, you always will.     What is the ceiling for you? Are you going to call an all in with a $1000? $10? Everyone has their limits.   Your reasoning is based on an emotional decision.  I don't fault you for that, everyone obviously has their ""ceiling"", so to speak.  But I'm never going to sit down at a game in my bankroll where I make a decision based on that kind of emotion.  If I sit down at a poker game then my goal is to always make the most +ev based decision."

Poker took a hit leading up to 2007 because of the financial crisis. Fish don't go to the casinos unless they have cash to blow.  Twitch.tv poker streamers will inspire new young blood to try and make it professional. They will go through a big learning curve. I see a slight boom like when Moneymaker won it, but we need more states to legalize online for this to really take off.   Poker dead? Not at live games. If you truly want to get serious about becoming pro, go to Vegas and pray on the tourists on those weekends in the wee hours of the night when they're drunk.  Overall though, players are much better now because of how popular it has become."

With blinds at 500/1,000, a raise to 2,100 might get disproportionately more folds than a raise to 2,000 while risking essentially the same number of chips.   I think it's a psychological thing. ..minimum raise vs a non min raise.   For cash games, it probably just  a quirk or superstition of the bettor.

Anyway from about half way through where I was getting pretty short, I absolutely nailed it. Thought I played flawless poker, making the best decisions all the time. Managing to induce calls when I wanted them, and knowing when to get away from things when I should have. I only remember losing 1 hand at showdown from then to the finish.  Anyway after this amazing moment for me, I too thought I'd figured out tournament poker, and decided to use all of my winnings to enter as many games as I could over the next few days.

Turn is whatever, 8x caught up and against better players you could consider checking back for pot control but here you probably should just bet in this game. Once he raises you need to be worried that he turned trips but obviously can't fold for a minraise. River is probably a fold since villain just bet like 8x the pot, you're at best chopping here unless he's a total maniac. Sure, it sucks that you do have a really strong hand but really all you have is top pair on a dry board, and on the turn he told you he had something good. Also you say it's unlikely for him to have AA/KK, while that's true a lot of bad players will play AA like this to trap and get scared when the board pairs so it is possible he doesn't just have 8s here."

I had almost no recollection of anything that happened though... I later found out that I made some really good reads and was apparently crushing everyone. I'm guessing it's more likely I just ran well and got a bit lucky. I've kinda wanted to try it again at some point just to make sure I don't have some kind of superpower when high, but I haven't smoked much and it was more of a two-time thing, which might explain why the effects seemed to be so strong. One part I do remember is shoving all in on a guy who was being aggressive and then took what felt like hours to fold, but every time I looked at the blinds clock about 10 seconds had passed."
poker,3buaxa,RudolfKGB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:21:45 2015 UTC,I don't get why we are raising flop here with an overpair on a board with so few draws.
poker,3buaxa,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"When MP calls I think he's going to have a lot of overcards in his range which kills my hand if any hit on the turn or river, and BB isn't leading out with draws so the majority of his range should be 8x which I think are likely to get it in given the previous hands I have on him."
poker,3buaxa,SkeetRag,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:00:29 2015 UTC,"MP doesn't seem to have a wide flatting range from your small sample, so his flat is pretty strong, BB has all the sets/2p here, and MP has AJ+, sets, 99+. I think raising is pretty suicidal to a donk and a flat from a decent player on a board with no real draws."
poker,3buaxa,withoutatrace123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:07:39 2015 UTC,"BB looks like a bad player to me and he could easily hold 8x. There are not realistically a lot of 2 pairs in BB's range, and if he is playing 43 he could be playing 87 as well. MP is probably folding a lot of JJ-99 and his overcards to a flop raise."

poker,3buaxa,karasz816,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:15:31 2015 UTC,"Preflop seems fine. On the flop, I think the raise is too big. If villain had like 50BB then I would like to see a small (2 to 2.5x) raise to induce a shove, but in this spot a flat would be best in my opinion. If he has a tendency to continue with naked overcards or PP on a lot of flops, then a small raise wouldn't be that bad of an idea, though.  Turn is standard."

PFR is pre-flop raise, which is the percent of the time someone raises pre-flop."

If so, Bovada saves all the deposits and withdrawals you make and you can go back and check their records with yours and see if they match up."
poker,3btzfv,jajison,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:57:53 2015 UTC,"I believe i have gotten charged for declined deposits and a few that have errored out. I have hundreds of them and the dates Bovada will give you, do not match up to banking statements since they get approved many days after your purchase. Also the one i know for certain is an error shows up on their records (both on the site and specifically requested through support) So this gives me less of a hope to figure out what has been going on and for how long/much.  Thank you tho."

poker,3btzfv,Brickhead816,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:01:47 2015 UTC,"This could be a case of a pending transaction. When you go to use the card it charges the 150 to the card, then for reasons other than your card being declined, the deposit doesn't go through (browser freezing) stuff like that. But the bank doesn't immediately receive notice that your deposit should be refunded. So for a few days your available balance will reflect the deposit, and then a few days later it will completely vanish. Since you said you have trouble keeping track this could be what is happening."
poker,3btzfv,Brickhead816,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:59:12 2015 UTC,Maybe remove the processors name in the op.  Contact Nevada and everything should be worked out. I've had great interactions with bovada through my times with them.

However if someone approached me and said i think there has been in error in depositing, look i have proof of this one, they aren't going to say oh yes you are correct. Now let me go back through and find if there were thousands of dollars in other errors we can refund you. There is a good chance not but at the same time i am stupid not printing up a receipt for every transaction I've made.

What are good books for someone who is just starting? Like the basics of basics (I've read nothing about poker so far, I found this reddit today)"
poker,3bs7w1,red-john,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"Like how basic? Not knowing the hand rankings basic? If so there should be the basic stuff on wikipedia or something like that. I started learning the game by watching the World Series of Poker and High Stakes Poker on youtube. You can also download pokerstars and play with play chips so you get the idea of the mechanics of the game (blinds etc). As far as reading goes I would look at Doyle Brunson's Super System, the book is very old but it should give you a better idea about the game. I am not sure if that is the best book though but it is the one I started out with. As a side not though don't play too much with play money, just enough so you can understand the mechanics. You're better off just playing really low stakes like 1c/2c games and posting hands on forums like this to get advice. Play money is nothing like actual poker."
poker,3bs7w1,DASoulWarden,2,Thu Jul 2 05:03:15 2015 UTC,"I know hand rankings and such, since it's kinda general knowledge. I meant more like basic strategy or core concepts. I remember taking a look at a 'For Dummies' about Poker a couple years ago and it had like a chart that said the possibilities of X hand being good, and at what point to fold, raise w/e    Maybe I'm confused, since I don't know what things I don't know :P, so I'll take a look at what you said.     You're better off just playing really low stakes like 1c/2c games   Also, why is play money so 'bad'. Would playing games with really low bets be kinda the same (assuming 1c/2c means cents, right?)"
poker,3bs7w1,red-john,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:21:27 2015 UTC,Yeah cents. There is a difference with play money and low limit games I don't really play with play money but I know it's always said that there is a big difference perhaps someone else can chip in. I recommend High Stakes Poker the commentary is pretty good with it so you can learn a bit but there is no substitute for playing and analysing your hands.

poker,3bs7w1,Geo_Hon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"Play money is meaningless because people shove all the time, sometimes with absolutely nothing.  It means you don't learn any post-flop play and anything you learn pre-flop will change once real money is involved (as small as it may be).      Depositing $20-40 for a starting bankroll is the best idea.  Also, I'm going to have to disagree with Redjohn on the high stakes poker videos, I watch them purely for entertainment, the level of play is not applicable to the micro stakes even for opening ranges.  Just Youtube: Crushing the microstakes and go from there."

Then you factor in the other two guys that are short stacked i'm folding it. Any pair, Any face card, and even high suited connectors is what i would shove there.

Then to suicide barrell off JThh 700bb deep trying to get AA/AK to fold when he could potentially have KK himself... people just don't do that when playing with 600k dollars, a significant portion of that I'm sure belongs to his friends and it's going to be on TV.  Would be legendary though..."
poker,3bsmtj,ooohkay,3,Wed Jul 1 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"Because people ""just don't do that 600bb deep"" might be the precise reason why a bluff might work.  You're right though I'm not sure how he could be so confident he didn't have KK if that was the case."

You have to remember that hes not just flat out calling 100bb, hes only calling about 70bb (getting about 2:1 on a call) more to be in a pot where both stacks still have over 600bb left behind.  If Seiver 4bets here with 99 (which is a decent hand to 4bet with deepstacked) he should NEVER fold to a 5bet of that size.  If he does, then he has literally NO idea how to play deep."
poker,3bsmtj,RunChan,-4,Thu Jul 2 04:54:46 2015 UTC,"Continuing here with 99 w/o some kind of absurd history is lighting money on fire.  Also, 99 is a terrible hand to 4bet 700bb deep. I'd much rather have A2s even."

AK is possible, but it's a little thin to be betting river for value.  It's possible he would bluff all-in on the river with AK assuming Colman has AA or AK, but Seiver has described Colman during the One Drop as ""Doesn't fold much of anything"".  It's gotta be KK > 70% of the time there."

poker,3bsmtj,killercars,5,Wed Jul 1 22:21:31 2015 UTC,Against a PSB on the river you need to be good 1/3 of the time for it to be a breakeven call.
poker,3bsmtj,Maxmidget,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"I know, it was just under pot sized, so Colman needs to figure out if Seiver has KK > 75% (fold) or < 70% (call)"
poker,3bsmtj,killercars,4,Wed Jul 1 22:57:00 2015 UTC,"You may have written it wrong then, because against a <PSB you need to be good less/increase your call frequency. You wrote Colman needs to be good about 70%, when he really needs to be good roughly 30%."

Having backdoor flush outs with JThh, ss, or dd also make the flop an easy float against a 1/3 psb. After reaching that spot on the river, he's laying Colman ~2.4:1 with his shove, so he ""should"" have 1 bluff combo for ~2.4 value combos. AKhh would also be an interesting hand to turn into a bluff because it blocks KK and Dan capped himself on the turn.

Flop was shit, and I'll bet with a normal c-bet kirk could have taken it down... but the 35k bet is so polarizing. He's saying I have Aces or I have air.  I don't think he bets like that with JJ-KK, because he'd want some protection from a hand like AK/AQ floating him.  Ace hits turn, and it just really looks like he has air to me, as it seriously blocks AA. Kirk probably feels like he could still rep AX... but I don't think so. He takes a half-hearted stab at the pot, and folds to the raise.  Again i'm no expert, but that's how I saw it."

It's one less thing to process.  Specific to this hand, they probably would've noticed the problem faster. However, they still may've just scanned the board as I would...""AQQ, two clubs""."
poker,3bpunu,lauxen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"4 color decks are much more essential online where you are playing 12+ tables and seeing hundreds upon hundreds of hands per hour.   In live, however, there's really no use at all. You see 30 hands per hour if you're lucky, and if you're playing top 25% on average, you'll play about 7 hands in 60 minutes. If you can't remember your 2 cards and look at the board once every 10 minutes or so, you really have no business caring what color the deck is - you have much bigger problems."
poker,3bpunu,djfl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"It's not about ""can't"". You can have 1 colour decks if you want, with just symbols like the Old West days. It isn't that you ""can't"" do it, it's that it's one less thing that you have to do. There is an advantage to having a 4-colour deck. Suits are obvious, and they're important so it's a good thing to have them obvious. I see no advantage to have a 2-colour deck other than legacy."

Jen had just came from another table who used the spades to determine movement from a broken table.

poker,3bpunu,BorkaBorkaBorka,3,Wed Jul 1 10:19:39 2015 UTC,A lot of the time when breaking tables they will use plaques with table and seat number of where you're moving to. You take this with you and hand it to the dealer when you get there. When they used the deck of cards to do it Jen must have either spaced out (likely) or figured she needed to take her 'plaque' with her like usual (unlikely)

poker,3bpunu,ShozOvr,2,Wed Jul 1 05:43:30 2015 UTC,it is something that happens all the way back at manufacturing   You'd think either the factory or the casino would atleast check the deck before starting. Takes a minute.
poker,3bpunu,Tunafishsam,12,Wed Jul 1 07:21:34 2015 UTC,The dealers are generally supposed to check the deck when the table is set up.  The cards should all be in order by suit and they should spread them across the table and visually check the entire deck.  This is just a straight fuck-up by the house.
poker,3bpunu,Heliocentaur,2,Wed Jul 1 07:49:04 2015 UTC,"Big time fuck up.  Or......... sombody 'held out' a card from a previous deck, and put it bak into play.  As in cheating.

poker,3bpunu,Tunafishsam,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:30:05 2015 UTC,I'd guess that they've brought in a ton of outside dealers to help with WSOP crush.  Much easier for new dealers of unknown quality at a new casino with harried management to make that kind of mistake.
poker,3bpunu,boomhaeur,2,Wed Jul 1 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"They appeared to be stuck together a bit though - even when she first fanned the flop out they both slid to the third card position and then she had to slide the other one back.  If that was the case, a casual fanning to inspect likely wouldn't have revealed the extra queen as it would have been stuck to the other one, thus only one queen would have been visible."

poker,3bpunu,lettis,4,Wed Jul 1 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"yeah absolutley, they should have spread the cards at the start face up and had an inspector look at them.  unfortunatley it is done like 100 times a day for an inspector and 99.99% of the time there is nothing wrong, so he half ass's it and prob just goes yep all good.  the dealer is prob more nervous about dealing the 250k cash game than looking at the cards and didnt pick it up, and the players just assume its all good.  every hand played with the faulty deck should be refunded if they can't figure out when or how the Q got there, it was likley there the entire time which means anyone drawing for a Q or drawing for the card that the extra queen replaced had the wrong odds."

poker,3bpunu,heapspray,4,Wed Jul 1 08:10:33 2015 UTC,Serious question.. If those are dealt to you the plus ev move would be to get it all in against your opponent because if he folds you won and if he calls the hand becomes invalid right? Also if he folds you could mix it back into the deck and have a slight advantage?
poker,3bpunu,FriedLizard,2,Wed Jul 1 13:57:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, except then you're a cheater. And also, if you do showdown your hand, it will be killed and the pot will be awarded to the other player."
poker,3bpunu,heapspray,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:24:48 2015 UTC,so the ruling would be that your hand is killed and the other player gets the pot? What if you said you didnt realize they were the same cards?

Admittedly, it was trivial to ""unwind"" the hand, if the argument comes down to whether or not you can easily work it out, should that even be a factor in the ruling?"
poker,3bpunu,FriedLizard,2,Wed Jul 1 13:35:00 2015 UTC,"Whenever there's a bad deck, the procedure is to undo the entire hand"
poker,3bpunu,FirstTimePlayer,2,Wed Jul 1 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"Even after the hand has finished and chips intermingled? Might have been a straightforward hand in this case, but presumably the same ruling should apply no matter how simple or complex the hand is.

If you are taking a bet/bet/bet line then I think you should bet turn bigger more around ~4/5 pot than 1/2 pot.   However on the turn check/calling is nice since we avoid getting reraised by made hands such as 78 and flushes, and still have outs if they have these hands.  If they can have Q6 here they will have many other Qx non 2 pair combos so in terms of value in the long run you will be making money."

poker,3bt36w,TheMagicT,2,Wed Jul 1 22:40:19 2015 UTC,Nothing makes you realise how poor your play actually is quite like watching yourself back !
poker,3bt36w,SkeetRag,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love recording my sessions and reviewing. Even when I think I'm playing my A game, I realize dumb preflop mistakes and post flop over nitty/loose-ness when 4 tabling zoom."
poker,3bt36w,lol_subreddit_hero,2,Wed Jul 1 23:17:25 2015 UTC,"First hand, you need to put in $1.22 to win a pot of $1.96. We need to include your bet to work out how much equity we need to call. That's (1.22 / (1.22 + 1.96)) = 38.36% equity needed, so you need to win at least this often to break even. If you're assigning him a range of AA no club you have 46.62% equity. It's worse when you consider that he could very easily have AA with the club, your equity drops from 46.62% down to 11.77%.  Assigning him a random AA hand, perhaps with a club, perhaps not, gives us 29.19% equity. ((46.62 + 11.77) / 2). This wouldn't work if we held an ace as it'd be more likely for him to have the club if we didn't.  If we think he has AA no club, we can work out how often we should call based on our outs (which you didn't seem to work out!)  We need to hit a T, of which there are 4, or a club, of which there are 8 (excluding the already-counted Tc), for a total of 12 outs. Using the rule of 4 and 2 we can determine that we have approximately (12 outs * 4 =) 48% odds on the flop. Pretty close to the exact 46.62%. This is greater than the 38.36% we needed, so assuming he has AA no club the call is good. Sadly we can never know that though, and I think he would have played it the same way even if he had the club. Preflop, given his stack size, I would not be very keen on a call. We could very easily be behind AQ/AK if we hit our K or Q, and from personal experience players that are fairly short stacked are going to apply a lot of pressure and look to shove on you quite early on. Perhaps this was not the case with this particular player, I don't have any reads on him and can't quite see your hud.    Second hand, you're in position so it seems okay to call pre, I think I can just about make out that we have no real history with him, so I'd be happy to give up if we miss. Our T might not be good if we hit, I'd probably be looking to raise if board is T high and he cbets, and give up if he continues.    Third hand, at micros checking flop and betting turn isn't good... especially with two overs. He's always going to call you down with a weak J or a T now that you checked flop. The pot is too small for you to get him to fold without putting an unreasonable portion of your stack at risk. Staying safe and waiting for cards is far better; people are unlikely to be able to let go of second pair after flop is checked. If you think he is calling your bet pre wide and you think he's not a station you should be cbetting flop and continuing turn. It's still going to be a lot more profitable to wait for TPTK type hands and have him call down with a weaker kicker.    Fourth hand you are wasting money. If he calls 7c on the turn with a weak club, he's also going to call the pot of 10c. Same on the river, if he's going to call 20c he's also going to call 23c, or 30c if you'd potted turn. It may only seem like a few cents, but that's a difference of getting 7+20 = 27c vs getting 10+30=40c. Suddenly your ""few cents"" on the turn and river have added up to an extra 32.5% profit."
poker,3bt36w,lol_subreddit_hero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:38:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for feedback.  first hand is for sure a bad call, thanks for breaking it down for me, he's basically playing his aces face up and when he has the club we are dominated as you say.  3rd hand is interesting to me as I don't expect micro players to check back middle pair on that board, hence my inclination to protect my nines. As you mention though playing safe is always better at the micros I guess, wait for those TP-TK !  Also 4th hand, I need to realise that my bets are for value, and the only cards we are getting value from are worse flushes and sets, both of which are probably calling pot on turn and river (at micros). So yeah I'm definitely wasting money"
poker,3bt36w,RudolfKGB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"/u/RudolfKGB pointed out that I made a mistake in the first hand when calculating the equity needed to call, I've just fixed that."

Sometimes, we may hit 2 pair but then we usually run into a higher 2 pair or watch that donk with the overpair counterfeit our hand once the board pairs.   I agree, fold pre! yesTHISisSARCASM"

poker,3btkbo,withoutatrace123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:17:28 2015 UTC,Rather than answer this question I would suggest re-reading what you have read because you have misunderstood the information presented to you about opening ranges and position. Check the beginners guide in the FAQ (on the sidebar)
poker,3btkbo,lol_subreddit_hero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"There's no mathematical difference in a ring game where the first 3 players always fold and a 6 max game. You could argue that the first 3 players are less likely to have high cards, but that's not strictly true since hands like A4o and K6o are often discarded by EP players in a ring game.   What happened there was KJ facing a steal deciding to resteal. I personally disagree with the resteal, since KJ is strong enough to call in a BBB situation but not good enough to stack off pre. If there were 100 people acting in front of the BTN and all of them fold, the situation doesn't change from a mathematical standpoint. What does change is that people have more aggro mentalities when the tournament goes down to the last 3 people. So while they might not steal from the BTN when it folds to them 9 handed, they will abuse their BTN 3 handed."

poker,3br61r,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it makes sense.  I have a hard time when I get raised on paired boards in general, like I would never raise this flop with a flushdraw but I don't think I have a raising range on this board anyway.   It's generally very polarizing between air and trips+, so I guess if villain is raising this board too much then we're better off just jamming as we don't get called often at all, it's really hard for villain to have a 5 here other than maybe A5s."

Villain builds a pot and puts Hero in really awkward spots when Hero has 77-JJ and also with hands like KT+, A9+, QJ, that either have considerable equity/showdown value against our perceived range or are weak enough to barrel (with some equity and enough juicy turns). Raising also gives Villain the betting lead and lets the turn to river line go x/b/c x/x or x/x /"

Thus villain is not good thus his raise could be a bunch of random overcards, flush draws, 66-88 etc etc.  Like I said though, all our options kinda suck, so perhaps jamming flop is better than calling simply because we can't really afford to make a mistake on later streets.  I think I fold river as played, but maybe jamming flop is better..."
poker,3br61r,Clarityy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:38:07 2015 UTC,As played I'm folding river without a serious read. I just think at 25z you don't get a lot of flop raises in 3b pots that aren't nuttish
poker,3br61r,SkeetRag,3,Fri Jul 3 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"Good analysis.  I like how you played every street, and I really think the hardest decision is the river shove.  It would be nice to see some hud stats on villain here if you had them, as that would heavily influence some decisions.  If he doesn't fold to 3b a lot from the button, or doesn't fold to a lot of cbets, the 3b PF semi-bluff might not be the best, for example.  But I think it's fine in a 25NL zoom vacuum like you said.    His line is pretty odd to say the least, It's hard to imagine what he's repping when he checks back the turn.  That being said, it seems really hard for villain to be taking this line with air, I'd imagine him to rep the flush at the very least on the turn if he really did have air.  But him checking the turn back to me seems he has some kind of a good showdown hand (5x, 9x, overpair, baby flush).  And the weakest of those hands being 9x, which we still most likely lose to.  I can't imagine he bombing it with 9x or an overpair, like you said, I'd think he'd value bet smaller.   As mentioned, his line seems to really narrow down his range, but I think it really boils down to villain checking back on the turn with some kind of showdown better than yours.  So, fold.    Interested to see others opinions."

poker,3br61r,RegiTime,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"We block no diamonds, block a lot of 9x combos. If we had JxJd, this is a far better hand as we reduce a LOT of diamond combos, as his 3b flat range is far more suited than not. Think of how many value combos there are here, and then how many need to bluff. We'll excuse spaz bluffs for this exercise. 6s7s, 6d7x, 7d6s, Ax5x, Ad9x, 4x5x,5x6x, TT+, Ad2x, any broadway dd....thats a lot of value combos. Bluffing hands would be a weird AK, probably one of them having a d, 78, weird broadways. Value hands far outweight bluff combos, and we're beaten by all the value hands."
poker,3br61r,dalonelybaptist,3,Wed Jul 1 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure how T9s has 'good equity' against a calling range here.  I guess it depends on your definition of the term but for me, good equity equates to at least 60/40 in our favour and would prefer an even better ratio than that when I'm going to be oop in a bloated pot.  I know it's cool and everything else to 3bet this kind of hand but my guess is that for most players (particularly for players that do it but don't really know why and don't have a large post flop edge against their opponent) this is not going to be a good strategy to adopt.  Yes, I'm a nitreg etc etc but for every player doing this regularly that has a crushing winrate, there will be who knows how many players doing this that are losing, or breaking even.  It's just completely unnecessary for $25nl to have this kind of play in your locker and if $25nlz is so hard that we have to be mastering plays like this to turn a profit then lol $25nlz."

I guess what I meant by ""good equity"" is not so much that we're in good shape as we are not in terrible shape when we get called. Hands like AJo, AQs, KQs, 5s-8s, don't absolutely crush us like they would if we were 3betting hands like KJs, 2-4s, and weak suited aces.  I do agree that I probably don't have a large post flop edge against a 25nlz random, but is it worth it to play some questionable 3bet pots out of position in order to pick up 3bb a pretty significant amount of the time PF with a 3bet? (this is not a rhetorical question, I am actually asking. How would I know whether its profitable or not?)  I'm also curious of your familiarity with bovada's zoom player base (not doubting you, just genuinely curious), as a lot of your videos focus on 888 and other euro focused poker rooms. From what I have read, bovada tends to be somewhat softer, though that could be misguided."
poker,3br61r,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"It's Bovada? I thought it was stars zoom given the z at the end on the NLz.  That does change my opinion slightly, although not too much because a lot of my post was a generalisation about $25nl in general and not necessarily zoom in particular.  Picking up 3bb a pretty significant amount of the time seems unlikely to me. My guess is we get folds maybe 60% of the time here if we played this out 100000 times against randoms.  We're not going to get rich doing it, thats for sure.  My opinon on Bovada Zone is that I'd rather see people I'm working with playing reg tables. Playing anonymously is hard enough, without adding another factor of playing every single hand in a vacuum.  If you have say a $1k bankroll. I would bet that your winrate and hourly would both be higher if you 4 tables $50nl reg games than played $25nl zone and your risk of ruin would be almost unchanged."
poker,3br61r,ADogWithThumbs,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:04 2015 UTC,"On the flop he has way more flush draws in his range than you do, but one might expect that a FD would raise bigger. I think once you flat his raise you never have a FD.  If his raise was a bluff on the flop then I would expect him to continue to bluff on the diamond turn, because as I said, I don't think you have a flush very often.  Given all that, I think his line is most likely an over pair with a single diamond. I don't know what bluffs he has in is range because all of them are better bluffs on the turn than on this blank river. Maybe he has a random spazz like 10% of the time. Seems like a fold."

We're beaten by a lot of his range after he shoves the river, IMO.  He's not scared of the flush, because you didn't lead river after he shows weakness on the turn.  So, he's capped at trips, but most likely going to have TT, JJ, or A5ish.  Your hand will be good here sometimes, because people will bluff like this, but I'm not generally making this call.  Edit for clarity"

poker,3bstmr,iamt1dal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yes but when I call 14c the pot is about 60c. Ok, so a pot size would be about 60c."
poker,3bstmr,withoutatrace123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary to go pot on the flop. The goal is to get your entire stack in the middle by the river when you flop a set. So suppose you wanted to go 3/4 P, 3/4 P on turn and river assuming we are against 1 opponent. Then work backwards calculate the correct raise OTF which results in that happening. If you want to GII OTT then you should probably raise something close to pot OTF.  My best guess is that you probably got as much value here as humanly possible. V1 probably had air and V2 probably had something like 88."

I can almost guarantee you that your overall quality of life is about to improve and even if your income drops slightly, you probably won't care.  Find a job that you find truly rewarding though. Poker is allowing you to have good options, so don't waste them. The salary of the job should matter less than the job satisfaction you expect to get from your chosen vocation.  It's hard to judge the just how much your emotional wellbeing improves for having a job, particularly a job you respect and value but when you settle into a job you enjoy, you'll feel it for sure.

I'm a med student myself which currently means I have a very free schedule for mtts which are my preference but will be on rotation 9-5 next year onwards, so was concerned this would make mtts a much bigger chore to fit in volume.   I'm a large field player on stars myself, so tourneys take around 13 hours to finish (obviously rarely run this deep etc) but was wondering how you manage to fit so much volume round work? Seem to remember you play ~$11-55 buy ins but not sure what site? Whats the run time on what you play, if you run deep do you just suck up and be tired at work the next day, and how many do you reckon you play a night? Been tempted to move up to higher stakes/smaller field for a while now but was wondering if you had any advice?  Thanks anyway man, and keep up the good work!"
poker,3brglk,Jacobtait,2,Thu Jul 2 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Hey Jacob,  Thanks for following man, really appreciate it.  I typically play 5-10 tournaments a day, anywhere from $11 to the $215 on Sundays, and during the special events when its like $300+. I usually play at 6PM and will start a tournament at the latest around 11PM. If I end up going deep in a tournament, it's definitely worth it to be tired in the morning, the latest I've stayed up in a tournament, basically Final Tabling was like 4AM on a work night, haha, but a 4 fig score is always worth it and I can't sleep anyways because of the hypeness!  Definitely move up to higher stakes if you have the BR for it, I'd say if you have 40-50x buy-in then move up, for example, if you have $5000, you can play $100 buyins. Make sure you keep track of all of the tournaments that you play, either in an excel spreadsheet or one of those holdem manager programs or something.  Hope that helps!"

poker,3brglk,Jacobtait,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"I played through high school an college. Nearly 6 years without needing a job (yes my parents did help me pay for school and housing so was lucky) most of my money ended up going towards traveling, partying, and bullshit along with my part of school/living and delicious food. Once i turned 21 it went towards wsop tournaments. Never really played many bracelet events but would live out there for the summer and grind the lower events and play at other places. My parents pushed me to get a full-time job and it has led me down the worst possible path I could have ever predicted. I tried to balance a 9-5 job with my normal 8 hours of poker and have still be trying to do this. I started off very well, but the lack of need for immediate cash let me think In my head i didn't need to cash out. Long story short I lost well over 150k in the span of several months online, (probably 5-10k worth of deposits). At one of my lowest points I was in debt for several thousand for a car i bought, i had $30,000+ on BV that had taken several weeks to build up. Somehow i kept it in my head that oh i have a paycheck coming and can keep gambling. Within several hours i had lost it all, deposited what little i had left, and tried to borrow more. All because i thought ""I have a paycheck coming and this is disposable income."" This was a huge turning point for me, I had busted rolls before but had always come back. For some reason i have not been able to get out of this mindset. Several days later i deposited $75, won a tourney for 2k, and ran it up to 20k in blackjack. I wanted so badly to freeze my account and quit my job and just get away. I would give anything to be able to go back and walk away from normal life for a while and just relax. I lost that 20k. I am now completely dependent on being at work everyday. If i do not get a paycheck I am fucked. This is extremely difficult to accept for someone who always set their own schedule and worked when they want to. It has made my life a living fucking hell and the more i try to dig out of the hole, the further i sink and greater i fuck up. I have come to the realization that at some point i went from being a very +EV player with nearly 30% ROI on PS and fulltilt to becoming a degenerate addict with no self control. I do not blame my job, I blame myself, but i associate the turning point in my life with suddenly having an income. It has become impossible to rationalize sitting at a desk, inside an office, even when there is little/nothing to do for $XX dollars an hour. I hate waking up every morning and do not understand how people can do this for their lives. As soon as i have solved my gambling problem, saved up enough money, and can do something i want to do... I am going to walk away from it all. There is little joy left in my love for life, I wish i had picked on or the other. The reason i loved poker was because if i suck, I have very little chance to get paid. Lately, I suck at life in general, the whole balancing act of staying up till 4AM and going to work at 9. Needless to say, i have not been getting paid.   Oh yeah, ironically enough, this is the first full year i have had a job since i've been 21. It also happens to be the first year i will be missing the WSOP after having played last years ME. FUCKKKKingshootme"

poker,3bq8x8,aejbug,2,Wed Jul 1 10:39:58 2015 UTC,"I have been playing for around 2 months in the evenings. I am playing mostly tournaments and whilst I am not coming first I am placing in the top 10-30% generally (sometimes coming last due to bad decisions). I would consider myself 'good' when I am not making bad decisions on hands, I am continuously setting myself goals centred around my game so recently has very much been around my though processes - opponents ranges, possible hands, and really working on my pre-flop game. I think it is hard to define what being 'good' really is, as even if I play each hand correctly the variance you will inevitably experience could really affect your opinion on your game. On the back of that, being able to manage tilt effectively is something that can really change your game. In summary, making good decisions and managing tilt effectively in games will be the point I consider myself to be good."
poker,3bq8x8,anonymous7,2,Wed Jul 1 07:55:18 2015 UTC,"If you think your good results in tournaments are due to good decisions and your bad results are due to bad decisions, you're going to have a bad time.  The fact is in poker, the effects of your good or bad decisions are so small you can't see them, except over the very long term.  That's what makes it so easy for the bad players to lose money playing poker, and that's what makes poker such a great game."

The variance is high enough in tournaments to hold some truth in your comment, but generally if I just guess my way through a tournament as opposed to making well thought out moves, I will have a bad time a lot more than if I didn't. When I say coming last due to bad decisions, I am talking stupid stupid moves like trying to bluff 4 people for an insanely high pot with a really weak hand 2 minutes into the tournament.

The first two weeks I was learning how the website worked, the order of hands and just getting comfortable with playing. I used play money during that time. If you're past that stage it is an absolute, unabashed waste of time. Play money games, on Bovada at least, are essentially games of who can shove all in the fastest. Not surprising because there is no ice rice otherwise. Don't waste your time--save up and use real money."

poker,3brxca,Stevenab87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"After black friday I would occasionally play the heads up nl games on stars and full tilt. I ground up a few million and think I actually got a lot better at playing vs fish from the heads up experience. You have to be playing high stakes play money (lol) for it to play similar to maybe 50nl vs a complete fish (ie you have some fold equity but villian has 0 clue). Occasionally someone not that terrible would sit and use reasonable bet sizing. I always assumed it was a 15 year old kid who had watched a few videos or read a poker book. Playing vs these types would be like playing vs a really bad bumhunting reg because they were clueless postflop even if there 3bet/4bet sizing and frequencies were reasonable.  Actually tbh I think I got alot better from play money because the fish you play are so extremely unbalanced in different ways you learn to exploit them and can then bring that to any game. This was after I already was half decent at 6max though, if you just jump into play money and use that to develop your game it'll probably do you a lot more harm than good."
poker,3brxca,ooohkay,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"I actually feel like play money and even real money under 10NL and anything under $5 buyin will not help you improve your play as quickly as playing higher limits will, mostly because these limits are prone to players who don't give 2 shits and will eff around way more than if you were playing in a higher buy-in.

So against flush draws, JJ/88, rando bluffs and made gutshots you have decent equity to call off the raise and call a river bet on a non-diamond.  As played good call OTR."
poker,3bsf48,joesun1015,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Good advice, was just worried to scare everybody off as the players active at the time seemed very tight. You mean raising more on the flop, right? I agree. I should have bet harder on the flop to make him fold low pairs that didn't hit on the flop.  I know it was a gamble, but when we got to the river I know I gambled a lot, but I didn't see any obvious outs than trips and I just prayed he didn't. Hence the title. :)"
poker,3bsf48,RinnyFlamboyant,2,Thu Jul 2 09:33:28 2015 UTC,"Several things you can improve   What do you know of your opponent? What is your image at the table? Is he tight/loose? Is he passive/aggressive? If your opponent is a regular TAG and you have a loose image, 3 bet bigger to at least $10 to get your stacks in as much as possible against another strong hand JJ+ while he thinks you are a maniac reraising again with A8o.  If your opponent is a LAG 3 bet to $8-9 for pure value and check/call the flop to show weakness, induce bets and let him take the lead. If your image is very tight and you know that your opponent is aware of that, it is even ok to flat call here to let your opponent put you a weaker range. Is your opponent a thinking player thats putting you on a range or he is just a "" I has QQ how much bet?"" player?. If he is that kind of fish its ok to even shove pre with the deeps effective stacks because a total fish will call with QQ+ there, or even JJ-TT. You can see there are so many factors involved and you got to start thinking more than just "" I has AA "" before you make your play.  As the hand played out , on the river I would put in a small blocker donk bet and fold to significant raise, but again, it is all opponent/your image/situation based. A tight player will be aware of the board texture and might just call. Also have you done similar things before with a marginal ""just want to show down"" hand? Did your opponent aware of you doing it? You have to take in all those factors and reason your play."

The article is not clear if other poker sites would make the block list, or only other ""gambling"" sites (online slots, table games, and similar).  I'm assuming that since Espacejeux is making the block list, poker sites will be blocked, especially if they also have non-poker type gaming available.

poker,3br0q3,RudolfKGB,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:22:59 2015 UTC,"I'm probably raising UTG+1's donkey lead.  His pot lead is almost never anything that beats you and, since this is one of the first levels of a tournament, I'd fully expect him to call with something like A8 or K8. Since a raise more or less commits us to the pot and there are a lot of bad turn cards, it may be better to just shove.  If someone behind us wakes up and shoves, it'd be a bad spot but, at that point, I think the pot is big enough and there are enough flush draws or lower overpairs out there where we'd have to commit the rest of our stack.  It's not a great spot, but I think it's good enough for my stack here in the early levels.  TL:DR -- Shove all-in to UTG+1's pot bet.  Not crazy about a call from someone behind us, but we may still be ahead."
poker,3br0q3,MathW,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to re-raise UTG+1's raise on the flop here, if the CO re-raises all in behind you, you can contemplate a fold, but I'm still calling most of the time in the microstake tournies since they'll still very often be showing up with worse.  Flatting his UTG+1's raise on the flop is the biggest mistake imo, it properly prices in CO behind you if he wants to stay in with a wide range of hands, and it puts you in a hard spot on the a lot of turn/river cards.  If it was HU with just you and UTG+1 I think flatting his donk bet on the flop would be ok.   As played, definitely x/f flop.  You're almost always only getting called by better here when you jam the turn since either one of them can easily be floating with Ax here."

poker,3brcni,MathW,2,Wed Jul 1 15:38:53 2015 UTC,I play lower stakes than this and that is an easy fold. Its a hand that is really only playable from button and just miserable in 3 bet pots. I would open with fold to button or defend as BB from a  raise from button/SB/co. And even then it is sketchy.
poker,3bp5as,gettindemdownvotes,5,Wed Jul 1 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"It's because Bovada/Bodog already have one of the top 3 us player pools, also their sports book is lacking, and always has been. So in-turn most affiliates are required to only promote sports booking, but are still getting money off their poker sign-ups.  It's just the way Bodog is trying to grow their sports book market, because if they do so, most people that play sports books are inclined to punt off in some of their winnings or they try to win it back. Which in turn makes the player pool more ""fishy"" attracting more ""regs"" thus creating the beautiful eco-system; ""Regs"" are able to live off of said money made."

At this point, I don't think they will ever be allowed to enter the legitimate market if things were to change. No state is going to allow them to ever be licensed, so they don't have anything to really gain by stopping now. However, they are of course operating with significant risk of what happened to the other services. At this point who knows what they are going to do."

poker,3bokb4,aDanByTheRiver,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:47 2015 UTC,"I would rather get the game 1 day late with commentary and hole cards then have it live with no hole cards. you don't get to see what they have a lot of the time because there is no showdown. so in essence you're watching guys throw chips around and bullshit with each other.  also, a lot of the bigger pots you do get to see are so standard and uninteresting. its like AK vs QQ getting it in preflop or a set vs a straight... ok, other than the money at stake that isn't interesting at all.  edit --  i think this is an important point i forgot to make. the longevity of this program relies on people being able to see the hole cards. if you don't believe me you can go back in history and there are a few documentaries that talk about how poker viewer absolutely boomed with the addition of the hole card camera. the point is that without hole cards this stream will never have an abundance of viewers and will eventually die a slow death."

That's somewhat fair.  But a decent solution would have been to just stream the game on a 12 hour delay instead of a 30 minute one.  Or even a 24 hour delay.

It reminds me of the Monty Hall problem: Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, ""Do you want to pick door No. 2?"" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?  I remember when I was first asked that question when I was younger.  It took me longer than I would like to admit to really wrap my brain around it.  Once you grasp this concept, it really helps you understand a lot of probability questions imo."

Wtf is up with people betting 1bb into big pots?  Especially in multi-way pots OOP.  It drives me bonkers.  For example, I'll be 2nd to act in a 4-way pot with AQs on a J57r flop and the player first to act donks out for 1bb into a 12bb pot.  I don't even know.  I hate folding for 1bb with two overs and backdoor possibilities, I hate calling with 2 people behind me, and I don't wanna raise into 3 players.  I don't even have a direct question, I just hate you if you do that.  XD"
poker,3bo4or,RegiTime,9,Tue Jun 30 20:06:29 2015 UTC,"Treat the minbets as checks and respond in the same way you would had the player checked instead of made a min bet.  ie, if you planned on checking, just call (unless you have no reason to stick around) if you planned on betting if checked to, then raise."

poker,3bo4or,Stixx_27,2,Tue Jun 30 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well, what about this.  I call a 3b from the SB with AJs from the button.  The board run out is Q5923 no flush.  Let's pretend the pot is inflated to 14bb~ on the flop and he bets out 1bb every street.  Can I fold any of those streets for 1bb?  It seems wrong to fold on all streets if he's betting 1bb since I feel my Ace high is gonna be good some of the time.  Or you take a 1/2 pot 'stab-bet' on the turn and he flats, only to lead out 1bb on the river.  Haha.  Please tell me I'm not the only one that sees this every so often."

poker,3bo4or,blisse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere a bit back that it makes sense to just treat the 1BB bets the same as a check. 3BB+ would be where I stop considering the idea that the 1BB is just a bad check, 2BB being situational depending on person and pot size. Obviously if it's a 1BB into a multi-way pot on a completely missed flop that hits villain ranges then just feel free to fold early and save money. But just feel free to c-bet ignoring the 1BB and re-evaluate on the turn and river."
poker,3bo4or,Hollow_Man_,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:54 2015 UTC,It's almost always some shitty attempt at a blocker bet with a bad hand. Unless you've seen that person take the min bet flop min bet turn overjam river line.

He put out a 1 BB bet then shoved 20BB over my 3BB raise. Wasn't sure if he hit a set or had a higher pocket pair. Didn't really feel like a bluff. Dunno."
poker,3bo4or,Hollow_Man_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sometimes people will definitely play the top of their range this way, which is equally bad. I think more often than not though they have a weak hand when doing this. Like RegiTime said I think it's just best to treat it like a check."
poker,3bo4or,Clarityy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:18:39 2015 UTC,"minbets are pretty much non-sensical and they mean different things depending on who does it. A couple of common (but very flawed) reasons people minbet like this:    They want to see ""where they're at"" without risking much.  They have a draw or weak made hand that does not want to call a big bet and they feel that a minbet might get them another card for cheap. They expect that you will react very straightforwardly, so that if you call a minbet on flop and they bomb turn you will fold too much (this one has a little bit of merit, you should not just call if you were going to bet yourself)   Luckily it doesn't affect us at all, we should just pretend villain checked and never fold. If we were going to bet, raise. If we were going to check back, call.  The only time it really sucks is if we were going to check/raise and they minbet. I think I generally still raise as I planned but sometimes just calling might be better and then leading out the next street.  When it's multiway in a reasonably sized pot don't worry about calling 1bb and then folding to a 10bb raise or whatever, that's perfectly fine."
poker,3bo4or,freakinbird,2,Tue Jun 30 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"Some players use it as an induce as well - it's pretty easy to spot when you see a guy who's been bombing all rivers, playing 55/35/18, and then a card that smacks their range comes and he rocks the minbet. /u/Clarityy is right in that it's quite player dependent though - for unknowns though, treat it as a check"

They are trying to rep a made hand that isn't going to get paid off and the bet is supposed to look like they are only doing a min bet to get something out of their amazing hand and you being a ""thinking"" player will recognize this and fold OOP. If you fold, clearly the other two guys to act are going to figure it out too and fold. Or so the logic goes...   /u/regtime has a nice answer to how to play against that crap.  Edit: I like the daily thread, nice job getting it set up."
poker,3bo4or,git_gud_loser,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:40:15 2015 UTC,I admit I have done this a bit because I have seen other people do it. It sometimes works so I guess that is why. I sometimes do it on a very wet board if heads up. Say the flop comes down 7-8-9HHH I might just min-bet. I guess at least they can misclick.

poker,3bobbi,Touch_Of_Red,3,Tue Jun 30 20:45:26 2015 UTC,Basically the 3x has changed to 2x for some of the following reasons  -can open wider and hence it's tougher for opponents to play against a wider range  -can call more 3bets because better spr   -lose less when fold to 3b   -better spr in general allowing for more post flop maneuverability  -better price on stealing blinds (only risking 2bb in stead of 3 for same blinds+antes)   I'm sure there are more reasons but this is all that comes to mind right now.  People are folding even though they are getting a price for some of the following reasons   -reverse implied odds   -tougher to play against wider range.

poker,3bmyje,myimportantthoughts,11,Tue Jun 30 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"Painfully ok.  Played about 25 live tournaments in Vegas, mostly for WSOP. Buy-ins ranged from $400 to $5,000 turbo.  Played around 55k in buyins, down around 15k.  Most notable finish was a 29th out of 22,000 people in the largest live poker tournament ever. (Was for 27k)"

poker,3bmyje,POKER_SLUT,5,Tue Jun 30 18:31:29 2015 UTC,After I sadly came 12th in the 10k guaranteed I decided to stop playing soul-crushing MTTs and start playing cash again. Results are good so far  http://imgur.com/pK3Qhp9
poker,3bmyje,Furples,2,Tue Jun 30 15:16:07 2015 UTC,Came 36th in that same tourny when my AA was cracked by 66 for a top 3 stack.  MTTs are brutal like that.
poker,3bmyje,tswpoker1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"Lol ""soul crushing"". I just had an almost 1000 gm downswing from June 1-26 playing stars and full tilt MTTS. 3 top 3s in the last 3 days somehow put June into the black. You just gotta stick with it if you're profitable, so many spewers in tourneys."
poker,3bmyje,nnDMT420,5,Tue Jun 30 16:21:20 2015 UTC,Yeah my downswing wasn't anything crazy but it does suck to spend 7 hours grinding an 800 person tourney and come 12th for $120 when 1st was $3.5k
poker,3bmyje,Furples,2,Tue Jun 30 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"It sure does, especially when you do everything right and get coolered or some idiot binks his 30%er. But you don't get the chance to play for that much equity, with such a large edge for an ~$11 buyin in cash games.  Volume is the key to tournaments, I've been thinking I need my soul to be crushed a bunch of times until I'm numb to results, take emotions out of my game. Haha"

poker,3bmyje,Buddys_dad,3,Tue Jun 30 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"Moved up to 25 NL Zone and had a pretty rocky start for the first half of the month due to playing bad and some tilty spew, but worked on some things and studied...then ended up with ~$700 profit on it for the month so pretty happy about that."

poker,3bmyje,tswpoker1,3,Tue Jun 30 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"6 buy in downswing over the course of 3K hands sent me back to 10NL.  I have been Captain BreakEven for the past two weeks unable to get back over $275.  I don't play very often, so I don't grind the hands to smooth out the variance. And, for gods sakes, I wish I could force myself to stop making crying calls. Holy balls do I need to stop putting money in when I know I'm beat."
poker,3bmyje,bulldg4life,2,Tue Jun 30 17:07:52 2015 UTC,Cry calling is a killer. You want to call just to prove that you knew you were beat. Fix that and your WR should improve :)
poker,3bmyje,BackHandAces,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a big sample, but I had 8bb/100 for 7500 hands then went tilt crazy. And, a huge percentage of that downswing was calling off large portions of stacks to shoves (or big bets) and losing to monsters. I think I just got the mindset that I have the best hand and I was playing well so I should keep winning.  When I went back and looked at my sessions, I was obviously trying to chase money with super-premium hands because I was frustrated they weren't winning."
poker,3bmyje,bulldg4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:04:06 2015 UTC,Holy balls do I need to stop putting money in when I know I'm beat.     That's a serious leak dude. Drastically changes your winrate when you get away on those hands!
poker,3bmyje,MrMogz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:39:01 2015 UTC,I know. Trust me....I know.  I am in the process of trying to be less emotional/tilty when I make preflop bets or continuation bets only to get aggression and not factoring that in to my decisions on later streets.  Being able to fold overpairs or playing TT/JJ in situations where the person obviously has AA/KK or hit their AK
poker,3bmyje,bulldg4life,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"You're not alone on this fight, brother. The key is to slow down tour reaction times. I feel the longer I force myself to think, the less likely I am to male retarded calls. In a cash came, it's best to leave the table when you get screwed over. Otherwise you're just going to tilt and.lose more trying to win back your losses. I think it's important to take breaks. (I'm being a hypocrite here, considering a thread I posted yesterday)"

UTG+1 opens 60, BTN calls I call.  Flop 9TJss, I check UTG+1 cbets 120 BTN calls I check raise to 400, me and UTG+1 get it in and he is drawing dead with 78cc.

I honestly need to study more, as ive only read one book, but i get so lazy as i have 3 other things I need to be studying for more.   Hopefully can get my discipline back, ive noticed ive been opening a wider range, and calling off more, overall acting like a fish.

poker,3bmyje,tswpoker1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"Desktop results: http://gyazo.com/8bd6d982e329ecbe393d21acf21809b7  100nlz + 50nlz 8 tabling 6max, standard.  Incredibly low volume month for me due to a number of reasons.   burnout from May. I went super hard in May, played massive volume. lack of motivation for first 2 weeks. I lost 6BI of EV at 500nlz, and 13BI of net $. Which is = 32 BI of lost $ in terms of 200nlz buy ins which is a huge bummer.   I also cashed $8k of rakeback last month and so far this month I've only cashed $1.6k (but have $3k of rakeback equity sitting in some format, VPPs + FPPs).   Plus I took a lot of breaks for analysis because I've been playing like a 6/10 level whereas in May I was playing at like an 8 or 9/10. This is definitely reflected in my pre rakeback results - I made SO MANY MISTAKES this month.  I've been incredibly tired/exhausted this month, sleeping awfully for like 3 weeks. Anyway, I'm looking forward to July where I can move into this awesome new house me and the boys are renting, gonna resume going to the gym, and just generally catch up on sleep/rest. Searching for the house last month was another stress / time consumer.  I guess with rakeback I will be just shy of my general year aim of $4k/month, but given my previous results I should be aiming for more nowadays.  So yeah, a pretty weak month overall given mental / physical state but I think with some R&R I can smash this coming month. I was really rusty when I returned to the grind and just made so many errors it's unbelievable."

It happened so slowly that I didn't even notice it. Not too worried, time to grind $3 triple-ups to start taking shots again."

Aiming to make it over $1000 by the end of summer which is the beginning of September for me.

poker,3bmyje,Berceno,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:33:46 2015 UTC,Are you going to play nl25 with 20bi? Good luck with that  And when u say summer you mean this or the last one? If its the first you are going to bust in no time
poker,3bmyje,AllTooNew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:25:35 2015 UTC,I've done this before yes. I've always used a 20BI bankroll management and it's always worked fine for me. If you are table selecting then I don't see any reason why you should expect regular 20BI downswings.
poker,3bmyje,AllTooNew,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"I dont know, i couldnt play wwith 20bi. In one bad day i have lost 15/20 bi and what happens if you have that day where you lose a bunch of bi like 7+ are you going to play the same with 13- bi? I cant aomost sit on all the tables i want, maybe you're way better than me or I dont know but i wouldnt play nl25 with less than 50bi and nl50 with less than 70bi but maybe you're way better than me the max i did was nl25"
poker,3bmyje,CarNNNN,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:03:41 2015 UTC,That's crazy. If I lose a couple of BIs I take breaks and head to the gym. If you're table selecting with a large edge and are not playing too many tables to capitalise on this you wont come across downswings greater than 10 buy ins regularly.   I'm also playing a LAG orientated game so my game has more variance included in it - Except alot of 10NL regs i'm encountering atm are very nitty and fold to solid triple barrel lines.

poker,3bplwf,TheKreamer,8,Wed Jul 1 03:18:55 2015 UTC,"Cbet flop. Villain almost never has a 7. So even if you are called, V has a range that you still have plenty of equity against. If called, I would think just about every unimproved turn you can check back and take a free river.  As played, I probably wouldn't hero call the river. Even if you are right by calling, you still are only chopping most of the time anyway."

poker,3bplwf,mastermin185,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:47:38 2015 UTC,Good point. I stand corrected.
poker,3bplwf,maximum_wages,-8,Wed Jul 1 13:40:13 2015 UTC,"It's close to cbetting.  It is hard to get anything better to fold.  Maybe the only hand that is better than mine that's gonna fold is JJ, TT, or possibly AK, but he might call one street with the first two.  While I have hands like AJ, AT, and other stupid combos beat already .  And AQ, KK, and AA are always calling of course.  The only things that are folding are probably hands I already have beat."
poker,3bplwf,maximum_wages,10,Wed Jul 1 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"Cbetting here wouldn't be to bluff a better hand. It is to take a pot that is easily yours. Villain misses this board most of the time and neither of your hands can likely handle much pressure. If you bet and win the hand 75% of the time, its better than trying to get 3 free streets and possibly getting bluffed off the best hand anyway or losing to pocket 8s."
poker,3bplwf,GODZILLA_FLAMEWOLF,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:57:52 2015 UTC,"Can you help me understand this practice?  I was told that every time I bet, I should either be trying to get called by weaker hands or fold out stronger ones.  Are you saying we should fold out the weaker hands here?  When is that the best idea?"
poker,3bplwf,maximum_wages,3,Wed Jul 1 06:23:00 2015 UTC,"The reason to bet in a spot like this is if you have a lot of fold equity and little value to extract from most turn and/or river cards. And because while you have the best hand often, you have to fold to villain's lead on unimproved turns and rivers. By checking back, you put yourself in a vulnerable position to be bluffed off chops and the best hand. No need to open your hand up to that situation if a standard cbet will allow you to play mistake free in this hand."
poker,3bplwf,withoutatrace123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:35:04 2015 UTC,"Fold out his equity. If he has 55 (not likely in this example but to illustrate) he's never calling a single bet and rarely ever bluffing, so you may as well fold out his equity the 8% of the time he hits something. You can put a lot of pressure on hands like 88-JJ  and SC which did not make trips. The SC particularly have good equity against your busted AK."

poker,3bplwf,pkpjoe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"Fold river. It sounds like you avoided a monster. I would guess he had AQ, KQ, or QQ.   As for the rest.  What do you think his opening range was? You said he was loose, could he be doing it with small pairs? You might be able to get that to fold if he is calling pre just to set mine. Plus, as mentioned above, you have equity against those pairs if you can't get him to fold. AA and KK are almost always 4 betting pre, right?   Maybe his raise/call range preflop is 88+ (but 0 or few combos of KK and AA as those 4 bet), AQ+, AJs+, KQs? Obviously that range is crushing you, but there are 24 combos of 88 through JJ you can potentially bluff out plus 9 combos of AK = 33. His range could also include some suited connectors depending on how loose he is. Add a few of those plus the 3 AJs, and you might have 40-50 hand combos that are beating you, tying you, or have equity against you that you can get to fold on the flop. There are relatively few combos that call you and have you dominated: 12 AQ + 3 KQs = 15 plus any pocket pairs he calls, which I think if you bet enough on the flop, will be few.   I think it comes down to determining how much you need to bet to get those 24 pair combos to fold. I would probably c-bet the flop like $70 and then give up if called/shoved on.  TL;DR - Your hand is losing to villain's range, and you can't win by checking it down. C-Bet flop with the intention of giving up if met with resistance."
poker,3bplwf,GODZILLA_FLAMEWOLF,0,Wed Jul 1 06:10:22 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the response,  Opening range wasn't anything too crazy.  He seemed more like the type of guy who would limp behind and 88 type hand rather than isolate with it, so I take 88 maybe 99 out of his range.  As for AA and KK, those are surprisingly not always 4 bets at live 1/2, so it is impossible to discount them.  I'm not sure if it is worth it to bet on the flop to eliminate the 12-20% equity he has with hands that I beat compared to the times he has me crushed with AQ, KQ, KK, AA and the times he continues with JJ and TT.  Also, I think your cbet is a little too big.  ~50 would accomplish the basically same thing as 70.  Overall, it is close, maybe cbetting was better the more I think about it since JJ and TT seem to be the most likely hands in his range."
poker,3bplwf,withoutatrace123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"You would have a better assessment on his range than me, but I don't think I would label him as loose per your assumptions on his possible holdings. As for the bet sizing. I generally agree that 70 is probably too large, but 50 might get the stubborn TT and JJ to call. Maybe $60-$65 is the sweet spot For the pot size. It leaves about $150 to jam into a $210 pot, so it tells a good story - you are reeling him in to get it all in on the next card."

You have to bet the flop or the turn and you have to fold the river.  There aren't exactly complex decision trees to follow here, it's fairly standard."
poker,3bplwf,CleverFreddie,-5,Wed Jul 1 03:49:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend you read the reply I gave to /u/maximum_wages below.  In short, I agree it is close, but the hands you are getting to fold (AJ, AT, AK  and stupid KJ JT combos) are already hands that that AK beats (or chops with another AK).  Only hands that might fold that are better are JJ and TT, but even then they might call one street.  I don't see 22-99 taking his line so those hands are out of the question.  AQ, KK and AA obviously call the flop.  Cbet is anything but fairly standard, really."
poker,3bplwf,maximum_wages,7,Wed Jul 1 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"Why is getting a hand that you are ahead of to fold a bad thing?  You aren't betting your hand, you aren't getting any value from those hands unless you hit a two outer.  Folding out hands you beat and/or getting them to incorrectly call is much better than checking back and wanting to call bets yourself. I didn't say cbet is standard, I said that betting the flop or turn (cbet/delayed cbet) is fairly standard.     I have no clue why you are so resistant to advice...that you solicited btw...maybe you made a horrible hero call and he had 44 or your buddy was giving you shit and you think you are smarter than he is.  But I mean this hand is pretty basic.  Don't call the river."

poker,3bplwf,maximum_wages,5,Wed Jul 1 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why I used it as an example.  If OP hero'ed and villain showed 44, OP would have won the pot and I was saying maybe that would make him resistant to thinking that hero'ing there is the wrong play because of results."

poker,3bplwf,Stevenab87,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:17:53 2015 UTC,"Why is getting a hand that you are ahead of to fold a bad thing?   It's not. Getting a better hand to call is though, and getting a worse hand to fold lets your opponent play perfectly. So yeh, maybe you realise your equity, but cbetting against a competent player doesn't seem ideal?   You could easily apply the same logic to the turn, and also a check call at this stage could easily get hero to showdown, so is it bad?  So now on the river we only really have to worry about a queen, which villain would have presumably bet on the turn. It looks like a fold to me, but it also looks like a good spot to bluff.  Obviously it's the ideal flop to cbet without the three bet, but what does have have that's folding?   Folding out hands you beat and/or getting them to incorrectly call   Also, what does this mean? You would recommend the bet because it's a bluff and a value bet? This doesn't seem right to me. I'm not the best poker player here though! Any explanation would be appreciated."
poker,3bplwf,1whysguy,2,Wed Jul 1 04:19:48 2015 UTC,"C-betting is pretty standard here. The only other thing that could be done is a delayed Cbet. Villain checking to you twice is weak. He missed the Q. That means the only hands he has that is calling a bet is TT, JJ based on your flop range. If not bet flop, take it on the turn. Villain is handing you this pot on a silver platter by checking twice.  Also, Red isn't a fish like me so just take his word for it."
poker,3bplwf,dalonelybaptist,-7,Thu Jul 2 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"Villain checking to me twice does not mean he missed a Q.  With a reraise to 40, something that seldom ever happens at 1/2, I think he most likely puts me on AA or KK.  V could definitely check back a KQ or AQ type hands on the turn.  In fact, I think this is his most likely range considering his river overbet."
poker,3bplwf,3BetLight,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"No, villain checking twice does not mean he absolutely missed the Q. Judging by his river shove, he probably hit the Q. But, you are contradicting yourself by saying he is never folding TT, JJ and Qs but he is putting you on AA-KK.  Either way, c-bet. He misses often enough to risk one bet to find out. Hand is so incredibly easy to play if you c-bet/delayed c-bet. If he calls, shut the fuck down and fold to a turn/river bet. If he raises, fold. If he folds, you win."
poker,3bplwf,myfistyourholes,-3,Wed Jul 1 04:17:23 2015 UTC,"I never said that is ""never"" folding TT and JJ but your point stands.  If he thinks I am that strong he would more likely fold JJ and TT which I think are a huge part of his range."
poker,3bplwf,Intotheopen,0,Wed Jul 1 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"If he thinks you are that strong, he wouldn't play TT/JJ anyway. You look more like you have AA/KK preflop than after checking behind the flop. Breaking down by combos, both TT/JJ together is exactly as likely as AJ by itself. So not exactly a huge part of his range."
poker,3bplwf,ccccccchhhhhhhhhhhh,0,Wed Jul 1 04:36:09 2015 UTC,Dude you are talking out of your ass pretending you know what you are talking about. This is about as standard of a Cbet as you could possibly get. I can't even think of a more obvious spot when you should be Cbetting.
poker,3bplwf,narcoleptic_insomnia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:56 2015 UTC,"But the advice is correct. You should be betting those flops 100% of the time in these situations. 100%. As played, you should be betting turn 100% of the time. It is not close at all."
poker,3bplwf,lettis,2,Wed Jul 1 15:35:48 2015 UTC,"I think you have to C bet the flop. Chances are he missed and you can scoop the pot right there. You'll get most Broadway hands to fold and mid-low pocket pairs likely fold as well at a 1/2 game since you 3 bet pre. If he check raises you on flop fold. Even if he calls the c bet its fine, you still have a lot of equity against his range going into the turn and likely free river with this line. Turn came brick so if he checks again check back and wait to see him act on river. Shows you have a strong hand but are slowing up against a possible monster flop looking to make a move on the turn. At river if he checks bet at least half pot but if he bets fold bc he was slow playing a monster. I guess he could be aiming to make a play but unlikely. He'd check a medium hand with any showdown value hoping to get away without facing another bet. All in all I think you played the hand weak and missed an easy pot to take down."
poker,3bplwf,kukukele,2,Wed Jul 1 15:33:38 2015 UTC,I'd probably cbet flop with AK specifically because his J9 JT hands are all v live but checking isn't a big mistake if we aren't folding turns.  As played fold riv
poker,3bplwf,rpm12345,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:02 2015 UTC,Your range is capped at ace high.  Is villain capable of doing this with K high <66.  No one knows.  As played imo it's a clear fold.  Calling 100 bigs in a 1/2 game with A high is fucking retarded.
poker,3bplwf,3BetLight,2,Wed Jul 1 08:00:48 2015 UTC,Why are you 3 betting and checking back? When you 3 bet you represent a very strong range at that stake. If you don't feel comfortable doing that when you miss with AK then don't ever 3 bet it then. As played fold river just due to the fact we now have no idea what villain could have and best case chop.
poker,3bplwf,iamcrazyjoe,2,Wed Jul 1 08:41:38 2015 UTC,"This is a very standard c-bet. At the very least a delayed c-bet. I really don't like the 3-bet, check, check.  As played, it's a fold I guess, but this is pretty butchered."

You're worried about what the villain might have here, but more than likely so is he/she out of position, without the initiative, and without a hand.  The bottom line is that you're going to win more pots here with a (delayed) c-bet as opposed to checking it down.  EDIT: As played the river fold is obviously good."

I always watch for tells for this reason and rarely if ever do I get anything definitive.  Also, while there are a lot of tells in live poker, a lot of them aren't as reliable as you would think and so many are super situational to that player, their bet sizing, etc.  I think there are some books out there on live tells.

YouTube search and you'll find one by Daniel Negreanu teaching you how to play a $10 Sit N Go and also a 6-handed cash game. Or watch the YouTube channel ""School of Cards"".   I'm just starting out but learning fast and here's the notes I've taken down for myself, they are noob notes so take them with a grain of salt:   Don't All In bluff the river  Be sparing with calls (AKA don't give your money away easily) Watch out for pocket sets  Don't trust top pair (it may not be the best hand)  If you have the best hand on the turn, don't let them flush out on the river  Know your opponents range Bet small but strong"
poker,3bnuw0,Xpeer_i_mint,6,Wed Jul 1 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'll be very honest with you, a lot of those are wrong.  There are spots where all-in bluffing the river is super profitable, and having an absolute statement like ""don't do X"" like this is going to hurt your thinking process, you need to consider these things.  ""Watch out for sets"" is not a great attitude. Sets are hard to spot, and being constantly afraid of sets will make you miss way more value than losing an extra bet to sets ever will. Instead try something like ""when opponent is taking a really strong line, reconsider the strength of your hand regardless of your holdings"".  ""Don't trust top pair"" again this is a bad mindset you are creating for yourself. Top pair is where I make most of my money, it's where most players make most of their money I imagine. Making a hand in texas hold 'em is hard. Instead try ""do not overplay top pair by trying to get three streets of value no matter what, consider the runout and villain's range"".   If you have the best hand on the turn, don't let them flush out on the river   This is the worst one. If you have a strong made hand on the turn and you bet a reasonable amount, flush draws might call incorrectly. This doesn't mean your bet was wrong when they hit on the river, usually they will not hit and you will have won an extra bet.  If I were to follow this advice I would just jam turn everytime I suspected villain had a flush draw, and that is losing way too much value.  If you give your opponent an incorrect price to call with their draw and they call, that's a great result, better than them folding.   Bet small but strong   I don't actually know what this means, but again it's too much of an absolute. Sometimes you should bet small, sometimes you should bet big. Do not hinder your thought process by making all these rules that clearly have exceptions.  I hope I did not discourage you. Finding resources and taking notes is a great way to improve your game, and if you are just starting out it's probably fine to have a couple of ground rules that you will not deviate from, but be careful that you are not developing a thought process that ignores a lot of possibly very profitable decisions/situations."

It has a couple of sample exams, which most books do, but it helps you understand HOW to take the test.  This is important, since the exam is on the computer and timed.    In all reality you know the majority of the information on the GRE, but the intentionally confusing manner by which they ask questions forces you to problem solve on the spot.  The book I mentioned focuses on that aspect of the exam.  It was great.    But do study the words.  There were so many words I had no idea even existed.  Best of luck in your studies!"
poker,3bn1ed,TooBusyForYou,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:02:54 2015 UTC,"I actually took the GRE already last year, did well enough on Verbal and Writing (or whatever its called); 80th and 93rd percentile respectively. But i honestly barely studied for those, as im applying to Econ phd, i need to crush the quant part. I ended up coming down with a bad flu the weekend before my test, and i think it really fucked with me alongside nerves. I ended up with a 70th percentile, even though im experienced with math (1 course away from a combined math major), i just cant deal with GRE math well.   Its gonna take me some time to relearn all the rules and triangle relationships and what not, but since this time i know what to expect going in, a little bit more on how to study, and i only have to care about quant, i think I should be okay. Aiming for around 94 percentile on quant. Also im hoping some of my poker studying will help even just a little :)  If you have any recommendations for quant materials id be more than open, ive heard the ETS practice tests are really the way to go, but id like to get as many good practice tests in as possible."
poker,3bn1ed,jamal_crawford,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"I completely understand what you're talking about with triangles and what not.  The reason I suggested the book I suggested is because, believe it or not, most of those geometry questions you actually can't answer.    For instance, without the statement ""Drawings are to scale"", geometry is all relative.  You can't answer questions about congruence or what not if the drawings aren't to scale.  This is something I never even considered prior to taking it, and the book ""GRE for Dummies"" helped point it out.    Aside from that book, there isn't anything I really did to do well on the GRE.  Again, I had a huge math background (Statistics + Math), so most of it came natural to me.  Best of luck on the exam and in your PhD studies!"

You're getting about 2.5:1 so unless he only shows up with flushes and you don't have the king of diamonds, you should have the equity to call. He can have 77,22, 72 sometimes if he's that way inclined. It's a pretty huge hero fold when you've got top set getting almost the right odds just to draw to a boat imo."
poker,3bo0m0,RudolfKGB,2,Tue Jun 30 19:47:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input everyone. In the end I made the call and villain flipped AA and didn't even have the diamond. Not sure why he didn't get it in on the flop but I guess he tried to turn his hand into a bluff on the turn and it damn near worked. River was safe and I scooped it. Fact that I had 10 outs if he had it and that there was a slight possibility he didn't have the flush is what ultimately led to the call. Could still have been a bad call math wise but was definitely a tough spot.
poker,3bo0m0,maximum_wages,3,Tue Jun 30 21:03:55 2015 UTC,Good call. There is a lot of over playing in 1/2 and definitely enough of the panic overbets on scary boards like this one in that game to warrant a call. Plus the worst shape you could possibly be in is 9 outs.
poker,3bo0m0,BobLeBoeuf,2,Wed Jul 1 03:28:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know where my response to this went - must have never submitted it.  I thought AA might play this way at 1/2 also.  Thinking of the one hand he'd overplay in this spot, AA came to mind.  22 77 and 27 (once in a great while) are also possible.  I've seen so many retards play AA like this at 1/2 it's mind boggling.  Good call.  I disagree that he almost always has diamonds at 1/2 here and think the call is (barely) correct.  WP."
poker,3bo0m0,no__u,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:36:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think SB can ever be bluffing here, as I don't think he can call your flop raise with other than a flush draw or a very strong made hand.  If we don't have any reads, let's try to assign a reasonably wide range to SB:  Axdd, Q9+dd, J9+dd, T8+dd, and some of 98dd - 45dd, AK, KQ, 77, 22.  Against all of the flush combos you have roughly 10 outs to quads or a boat, so about 20% equity.  The other combos have some equity (about 6%) against you because they may contain diamonds.  There are roughly 15 flush combos and 14 other combos, so you should have a little better than 50% equity overall given these ranges for an easy call.  It stops being an ""easy"" call if you assume he is actually a good player and can never shove with a hand like AK or KQ -- you'd be down to 6 combos that you beat, for a total of about 40% equity in the pot.  But that's still good enough for a call though as you are getting better than 2:1 on your money, so you only need 33% equity.  Also, it sort of matters whether you have Kd, or if the king on the board is a diamond.  If you have Kd it increases your equity against villain's range, and if either you or the board has the Kd it reduces the number of flush combos villain can have (some people will try to see flops with Kx suited for cheap).  For the purpose of the analysis above I've assumed the Kd is on the board but it doesn't have to be."

The pot is 340ish + the donk 250, so we have to call 250 to win ~600, we need 30% equity. I think it's close, but a super cry fold. Maybe a set of 77 or 22 does this at some frequency, albeit very low as they'd just ship, dude has diamonds here often. Assuming the d is not the K, and we don't hold the Kd, lets assume virtually always for our equity calculation.   We have 22%, making this a significantly losing play. I think we'd have to have a SOLID read that V could over value sets/2p/nfd+pair here to even consider it, but....the donk lead pretty much says we're fucked here.   ** Note, if we have the Kd, this becomes very close, especially if V does this without the NF"

The ER said he is running a temp, but none of his other blood work came back worrisome. We took him home full of drugs and a surgically implanted fluid sack (thanks, science!).   He seems to be doing better, but I've downed several cups of coffee and will keep an eye on him throughout the night.   Nice to have a fun BR with which to monkey throughout the night."

Became listless as well. Took them to the vets for meds and put them on an IV. 3 days later they were back to normal. Hopefully that's all that is wrong with your pup.

What JRB is saying is basically okay you are telling me I am good, then muck your cards so the pot can be awarded to me and I can then muck mine and nobody sees mine either.  Some can say it's an angle shoot to get away from showing your cards as the other must show is. I am on the side of the table of just show your fucking hand so we can move on to the next.  Side story - This happened to me in a tournament a couple of weeks ago. Villain checked river and because I am a vagina I checked back. I was told ""you are good"" .. I flipped over AJ and then heard ""ohh I have that beat"" Where as if this player would have flipped up their hand I would have just mucked my Ace high. Do I think it was an angle? Meh whatever, I just know when playing against this person in the future I am never showing first unless I was the agressor."

I'm yet to see him pull this trick on someone who spots it, but since I spotted it it drives me crazy.  Had a guy at a micro live tournament a couple of weeks ago pull this on me. He knew what he was doing. I just said ""you don't know yet."" and pointedly waited for him to show.  It shits me every time. When a hand is over if I've been called I turn my cards over and politely say what I've got."
poker,3bjnbw,smug_seaturtle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by being on the side of the table of if you believe you have the winning hand just flip it over and move on.  It is beyond infuriating when people hold up the action just because they are afraid to give away information, information that you just paid to see.   I am the same way, I'll flip over my hand when I am in turn to or if I believe I have the winner. Shuffle up, next hand please!"
poker,3bjnbw,EverGreenPLO,2,Tue Jun 30 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"The rule is that the last person to make an aggressive action (bet/raise) has to show their hand first at showdown.  I've also seen some rooms where the rule is if the river goes check/check the person first to act has to show.    The etiquette here is tricky.  Since in live play you can't just click the ""last hand"" button and see every hand that made it to showdown, there is some desire to not show your hand to obfuscate your play and/or hide your embarrassment at not getting away with a bluff.  Some players in this spot will say ""you've got it""/""you're good"" meaning ""I'm bluffing just show your hand and you'll win the pot"" or something like ""[top pair] is good"".  Obviously they aren't going to release their cards, though, since there is some small % that they are still good.    Personally, if someone tells me I'm good, and I have a decent hand, I'm just going to table it and take the pot.  My theory is I already have them on a very tight range so seeing their exact hand isn't going to help me and my goal when I play poker is to keep the table light and fun to encourage people to splash around and play loose.  The kind of person to say ""you're good"" is the kind of person to get irritated when you make them show you their hand because the rules say you can do it.  Then that guy gets mad, and he starts spouting off to his neighbor and soon the whole table is uncomfortable and not having fun.  No need for that.  If I get angled, I get angled, it's not a big deal and I can always motherfuck the guy if it was intentional (which, I know, is directly counter to what I just said).  Some people are very strict about ""the rules say I can therefore I will""/are very scared of getting angled, so they always act in turn (making the other person show or fold if they were the last aggressor).  Those people aren't wrong and aren't necessarily assholes but in my opinion they are playing it a little incorrectly."

poker,3bjnbw,strongsauce,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:56:34 2015 UTC,I'm trying to think of a hand Phil can represent when he min 3-bets the flop. Literally nothing legitimate plays the hand the way Phil does and there's zero leveling going on since Phil doesn't even know Kanit.  Also high likelihood that PokerNews or whatever reporting website got the hand history wrong.

poker,3bojmv,DingDingDao,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:22 2015 UTC,"New players tend to suffer from a couple of major issues:  1) They play too many hands  2) They bluff too much (because they saw it on ESPN) and they call too much (because they can't contain their curiosity)  Based on those two primary issues, my advice to you is:  1) Play tight.  Like, really tight.  Play blackjack hands (i.e. AT or better) and pairs 77 and higher.  Mix in broadway hands (two face cards) if you like.  2) Bet for value.  What I mean by this is, bet when you have a good hand.  You need to be able to understand relative hand strength.  AKdd on a board of AT742rainbow is pretty strong.  AKdd on A9876hhhh is pretty weak.  3) Don't bluff.  New players don't fold enough to make it worth your time."

Don't worry about playing by the rules and trying to play a boring text book game, just do whatever feels right and enjoy yourself.  If you find it fun to bluff 100% of hands, do it and enjoy the game even though it is a sure fire way to lose. Same goes for making silly low percentage plays. To hell with playing disciplined poker, just enjoy the game.   Poker at its very basic level is best learned through making mistakes, and then working out why what you did was a mistake and not repeating it next time. Once you have a feel for the game, that is when you start to appreciate and enjoy playing a textbook game more. For a first time player, folding 10 hands in a row is good to be boring, even though folding before the flop more often than playing a hand is normal.  Good luck, enjoy the game!"
poker,3bojmv,Mozzykins,0,Tue Jun 30 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"play 10-J or higher, or any pocket pair. New players are more scared to raise preflop, so if you get 2's you can see a flop cheap enough. If you hit a deuce, you're money. Be mindful of raises, a raise doesn't just mean that you have to pay more to play, it means that your opponent has a strong hand. Never go all-in on a draw unless you have an open-ended straight and flush draw on the flop. Even then, you should consider folding. Check your monster hands. If you flop a set check it, make a flush on the turn? check it. The check raise is your friend with a monster. Relax, have fun, it's a game"

Many players live in Austria because they dont have to pay income taxes because poker is seen as gambling and you normaly dont pay income taxes for that there.

poker,3bl8we,peterw8,3,Tue Jun 30 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"Hand 1 fold turn, most of his raising range has Ax and he's cbetting Ax a ton. You only really beat KJ/KQ of spades that is still betting.   Hand 2 fold pre. You hit your top pair and are already not sure what to do on a king high board. Fold flop because he's overbet and you can't stand any more pressure on further streets even if he is just betting a jack or flush draw. Against these guys you get the nuts and let them barrel off at you."
poker,3bl8we,RudolfKGB,2,Tue Jun 30 03:33:13 2015 UTC,"PF call of villain's raise is. .meh...not terrible, but It's gonna be a hard hand to play OOP against a button raiser who is a thinking player.   Flop call seems fine.   I probably give up on the turn even though his sizing is on the small side.   Again, pf complete is going to make for a tough hand.   I guess I don't mind it, but I'm not putting money into the pot when one of them overbets a king high flop."
poker,3bl8we,MathW,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:36:49 2015 UTC,"My first analysis and I'm relatively new, so I could be off the mark, but here goes:  Hand 1:  PF: In general I'm not crazy about limping here and planning to call a raise. I think if we're planning on calling the raise, we may as well take the initiative if players are giving respect to your PF raises (you mention a pretty strong raising range if other people are paying attention). You have the correct odds to call here, I think.  Flop: I don't mind a x/r here. If he's a TAG player, his raising range will be something like 88+, ATs+, AJo, KQo, probably some suited connectors. I think a check-raise both protects our hand against the  ace face combos which are air c-betting here and may prevent us from seeing a scare card on the turn. We aren't getting value from those hands in later streets because if they hit we're way behind, and if not, they are getting terrible odds to call if we size properly. If he comes over the top, I think it's considerably less gross than the situation we end up in on the turn if J+ comes. We can probably just fold without any real history on the player in that case. If he calls, we can re-evaluate on the turn.  Turn: By now I think your hand is pretty face up as a middling pair of some sort. Your flush draws are likely folding out. It's entirely possible you're getting outplayed here, but I think it's a fold. You're not beating anything that isn't bluffing you, and the only hands that are bluffing are Pocket Pairs <10s. With your hand as face up as it is, I don't think you can call another street without improving.  I'd be curious to read other opinions, because that hand was pretty tough for me, and is the kind of situation I run into a lot with little idea what to do.   Hand 2: I'd rather just fold this than complete the blind. 98% of the time you're not flopping two pair. And when you make your top pair, you're put in this type of awkward situation. Not worth playing IMO. As played, probably just fold so you can wait for a better spot to put lots of chips in."
poker,3bl8we,lancemarx,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:09:22 2015 UTC,"Many players at this table will limp with the top of their range and almost any two cards in between. I had been only raising with premiums since most raises get called by at least 2-3 people   Just a thought, but if this is your description of the game you are playing, then getting involved in these spots is counterproductive.   If the game is playing incredibly loose/passive/fishy, tightening up your range and hammering people in position is the default strategy."
poker,3bl8we,cdj5xc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:27 2015 UTC,Fold both hands pre
poker,3bl8we,withoutatrace123,0,Tue Jun 30 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Hand 1: Since he seems like a thinking player, he's probably got a pretty wide button raise range.  We're still ahead half of it, and the bet isn't too large.  This is a call to me.  I think a flop check/raise is good too.  But if you just call flop, you have to be willing to call a small turn bet when an overcard hits.  Hand 2:  Fold pre.  Fold flop."
poker,3bm9vj,Pursu7it,8,Tue Jun 30 10:48:03 2015 UTC,"Calling preflop is totally fine on the BU with 87s, I like it.  Your flop raise was absolutely perfect IMO, you want to raise big on the flop to get value, to protect your hand and to make it easy to shove the turn. This is not a hand you want to slowplay, or even see a river with. If you make it smaller you allow people to hit their draws cheaply and it makes it harder to get stacks in on the turn. At $2NL the big mistake people make is calling too wide with bad hands, so the best way to take advantage is to just bomb it when you have a good hand.  The 3 on the turn is not the perfect card but with only about 60% pot to play you absolutely have to shove, there are still flush and straight draws to protect from and hands like 8x or even 7x might call you. Your jam is good, I like it.   You were very very unfortunate to run into a set here, on the turn there are only 3 set combos remaining compared to dozens of combos of flush draws, straight draws, and 8x. Someone playing 70/0/0 is going to show up with so much junk and draws here, you are almost always ahead IMO.  I think you played that hand pretty well. Don't think that because you got the money in drawing dead you misplayed the hand, that was totally unavoidable."
poker,3bm9vj,myimportantthoughts,3,Tue Jun 30 11:37:10 2015 UTC,"I just want to say I totally agree with this analysis. It's unlikely BB called cold with a naked 3, and on the other hand, you have plenty of equity to get from pair + FD combos (7hXh), straight draws that these low stakes fish can never drop (even when the price isn't right), and obviously you have his naked 8's crushed. It just so happened that he made an lolslowplay of a flopped set (which is horrible, given turn SPRs and how many cards can kill his action), so I wouldn't fret about getting your stack in dead."
poker,3bm9vj,jdr_0317,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your post! But can you explain why you think his play was wrong? I mean he wasn't a good player - he lost his $4 in a few hands later. However I think his check to the Pre-flop raiser was ok, plus then he let me hang myself by just calling. and not raising (he might thought that it is unlikely that I have a flush draw, because I was betting). To conclude, I think he played this particular hand fine. Still overall he was a bad player..."
poker,3bm9vj,jdr_0317,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"It's simple really; your flop raise is pretty much committing you to this pot. It's $0.24 before the flop, and after your raise to $0.80, there's $1.28 in and you've $1.14 behind. If he shoves, are you really folding often at all getting 3:1? Any draw you'd raise the flop with is priced in, and hands like A8 will call as well.   Against your RANGE of hands, he played this terrible. If you held a FD, OESD, etc, he risks not getting your entire stack, and gives you the chance to take a freebie on the turn if you'd like. And if you aren't stacking off to a shove w/ this hand, drawing effectively dead, you're doing it wrong.   Moreover, what does this do for his range of hands? If he's 3 bet stacking off any flush draw or OESD but cold calling sets, then he sets himself up to get owned (as you can profitably call a shove from this guy w/ any pair). As a limit player, seeing how people play their range of hands is important for me, and should be important for you too. This is a huge leak among NL players, IMO, but it's understandable why; they simply don't play as much postflop poker as a limit player. Exploiting these imbalances is where the $ is postflop."

poker,3bhy9q,OmahaLaserShow,-3,Tue Jun 30 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that thinks this bluff isn't that impressive? Ryan flatted preflop, made a weak flop stab, checked the turn and IMO telegraphed his check-raise bluff by the way he quickly announced it.  There is no strong hand that makes sense in this spot. Seems like an easy decision, esp for a seasoned heads-up specialist such as Ike."
poker,3bhy9q,qwedswerty,7,Mon Jun 29 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"if there was no way to tell that this might be a good opportunity to bluff, then this wouldn't be a good bluff, just random donking off and accidently succeeding. If you make this kind of bluff even semi-regularly and you don't lose money doing it, i am very, very, very impressed."
poker,3bhy9q,OmahaLaserShow,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"Of course. By no means is this is a standard play.  I wouldn't attempt it online or in a cash game. That being said, the tells that Ryan gives off in this live heads-up hand point to a re-shove being optimal in this spot."

poker,3bhy9q,Mendoza2909,4,Mon Jun 29 15:16:07 2015 UTC,But why did you think that better people might be able to make that call? No strong player in their right mind would ever make that call.

poker,3bhy9q,Dummbullen,4,Mon Jun 29 15:45:12 2015 UTC,"The point is, he could be bluffing with 8 high and have the same body lanugage. Calling with 7 high would 99.9 % of the times be insane."

poker,3bluoe,_Solid_,3,Tue Jun 30 07:11:49 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused by what you mean re. Action not being forced in cash? Is it the gamble you're looking for?   Anyway: yeah tons of people play both cash games and mtts with success. It's still the same game ultimately haha
poker,3bluoe,dalonelybaptist,0,Tue Jun 30 09:45:30 2015 UTC,Action not being forced in cash?   the blinds increase in tournaments forcing action.   It's still the same game ultimately haha   i disagree completely. you shouldn't usually have a swallow stack in cash games. when you have 30bb it heavily alters the way you play and your hand selection. this is commonly where people end up in tournaments because a good portion of the time in tournaments you don't cash and its rare for you to get it in like 100bb in a tournament unless you're coolering someone or getting coolered yourself.
poker,3bluoe,dalonelybaptist,2,Tue Jun 30 10:02:40 2015 UTC,"So basically yes you're looking for the gamble as ""action isn't forced"" in cash games isn't true as ultimately blinds still exist lol"

poker,3bluoe,LostInPoker,-1,Tue Jun 30 07:19:14 2015 UTC,the MTTs on bovada are largely not worth playing because a lot of them are really low level tournaments like $500 prize pool and the others are like 10k prize pool with $100 buy in which isn't worth it.  its not like pokerstars where at any moment you basically have amazing tournaments to play.

poker,3bkqfe,kTmike,6,Tue Jun 30 00:45:13 2015 UTC,Biggest favor I've received was a guy letting me use his room after I was stone dead exhausted and was debating between crashing in my car or driving 4 hours home.   Biggest favor I've given was giving a ride to a guy I had just met at the table for an hour. His friends ditched him and he needed to get back home which happened to be near where I live. It was a 3 hour drive to my place and he was only 30 minutes further so I offered to drive. He threw in some gas money to say thanks.  Neither favor resulted in me getting assaulted or robbed so I'd say they worked out pretty well.

I haven't played at Eldorado or Atlantis for a really long time, but Atlantis has $1/$3 games while the other three casinos are $1/$2 NL games. Peppermill has the occasional $2/$5 games and they used to have $5/$10 games every now and then, but I haven't seen one in awhile. No idea about limit games, never really paid attention to them. Whatever casino you go, you can pretty much expect 1 or 2 $1/$2 no limit games going on.  I really enjoy the atmosphere of the Peppermill and GSR poker rooms. Although I haven't played at Eldorado for a long time, they were the easiest games for me, but lots of background noise (slot machines) and the ceiling's border has lights that are constantly flashing.  EDIT: When it comes to tournaments. Peppermill and Atlantis has daily tournaments multiple times a day. If I remember right, the evening one has $55 buy-in with about 30-35 entrants. I don't remember about daily/weekly tournaments at GSR, but they have good event tournaments that have really good turnouts."

Its not really safe also fees everywhere with btc.   LOL.  Sure.    Buy it using local bitcoins, or an ATM, or use a mixer if you're super paranoid.  But now that you mention it, I'm curious if you can use any pre-paid cards with coinbase or circle to buy coin.  I'll have to try.  As for the fees.  Sure.  Whatever...    I can buy on Coinbase right now for $260.98, and the lowest spot price per bitcoinwisdom.com right now is 258.29 on BTC-e (a russian site).  I can buy via LocalBitcoin.com and hook me up with somebody near by if I wanted to go that route.  In my area people are asking $265-270 right now.    It doesn't cost me anything to send those bitcoin out to my local wallet (except the BTC transaction fee of about a penny).  I've transferred thousands of $USD of BTC purchased on coinbase out to cold storage for long-term speculation and  I haven't paid a dime (well, maybe about a dime, as I transferred to multiple addresses).  How much is a money order going to cost you? Or the fee on a pre-paid Visa card?  When I transferred BTC into AmericasCardRoom I got 100% of my BTC deposited into my account (no fees on their end).  I (sigh) haven't had the chance yet to withdraw BTC from them, but according to their site there is no withdraw fee using BTC  So please ... tell me more about these bitcoin fees."

So if I deposit money into a site, I'm personally not breaking any laws.

poker,3bk6h7,Asmithpoker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe and maybe not     The bill states ""[n]o person engaged in the business of betting or wagering may knowingly accept"" any money transfers in any way from a person participating in unlawful Internet gambling.   So by accepting any sort of money for betting or wagering is against the law.  Sending money is not.    Is bitcoin money?  Ask one agency and it is.  Ask another and it isn't.  It all depends on how the interpretation they want works out to their goals.  I'm pretty sure that, for the purposes of claiming it is money to shut down a betting site for violation of UIGEA, the feds would say it is.  They won't say it is when it comes to the IRS, because they get less money on the capital gains appreciation when it is sold or used as currency.  Can a foreign enterprise be held to U.S. law when it located overseas? Yes.  If they are doing business with residents in the U.S., there is case law that the U.S. could claim they have jurisdiction.  Of course, exercising that would be difficult since it requires cooperation of the foreign government.   Would the feds pursue it?  Given the events of Poker Black Friday, Silk Road, and Mega they've shown that they might, and it's a risk any operator needs to be aware of.  Even if the feds ultimately lost a criminal case, just coming down on a site like Bovada or WPN might be sufficient to shut them down."

Subtract some equity in case your opponent outdraws you and makes a better flush or better - let's say s/he does 6%  of the time (which, I ought to say, is probably egregiously high). Your flush draw then gives you 30% equity in the pot.  Do you think your opponent's bluffing - and you're beating that bluff - at least 20% of the time (the difference between 50% and 30%)?

If I have 30% equity and my opponent is bluffing 20% of the time, do I suddenly have 50% equity? If I have 30% equity and villain is bluffing 70% of the time, am I going to win when I call 100% of the time???

The majority tend to have a fixed lifespan as players come and go. Some have lasted though and many friends have been made.  I'm in the process of starting a couple new ones for mature, committed players. We will also provide some coaches to moderate these forums to ensure quality discussion and reliable feedback on hands.  If you're interested, you can reach me by filling out this form. Of course just be sure to mention that you're interested in joining a skype study group.  Also, you said you're thinking of switching to tournaments. Here's why you should stick with cash."

poker,3bkakj,BackHandAces,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:20 2015 UTC,Readless I think this is a very clear shove. Maybe you can fold if there are no antes? Probably still shove. There's 2.5bb (3.5 with antes) out there and you have 5bb behind and an ace.
poker,3bkakj,Clarityy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"Cool. Ty.  Just wondering, If I am readless here and multiple people limp instead of 1, does this just give me all the more reason to shove given I have a semi-decent hand and there is even more dead money in the pot?"
poker,3bkakj,RudolfKGB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:18 2015 UTC,If there's more people you're always getting called and rarely have the best hand so it's probably better to fold in that spot. Pretty gross if there are antes eating away at your stack but I think you just have so little equity that you're still better off giving up the 0.5bb for the SB.
poker,3bkakj,Touch_Of_Red,2,Mon Jun 29 22:42:58 2015 UTC,You don't need to have the best hand to make a shove a +ev play DUCY?
poker,3bkakj,RudolfKGB,2,Mon Jun 29 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"After reading a good analysis I realise why I was wrong, I'll go back into my corner now."
poker,3bkakj,Clarityy,0,Mon Jun 29 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Basically if you give overlimpers any kind of range, it becomes wider and wider the more of them there are.  Sure they might have A8 A9 maybe even AT but you would expect AJ+ to isolate, and any pair other than AA you're doing fine against given that you're basically ""priced in"". Expected to see more suited connectors, broadways etc, all of which you beat. Your hand smashes a limper's range unless you specifically know they're only limping strong hands.  You're going to get called by worse hands a lot (and correctly so with the odds they are given). You simply have no fold equity with 5bb."
poker,3bkakj,FootofGod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what I was thinking, but wasnt 100% sure about.   Thanks for the response :)"
poker,3bkakj,Clarityy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:53:56 2015 UTC,"You say that. Then I witness people limp-fold with 3 bb. Never overestimate people. You may not have a lot, but it's some. People will limp-fold suited connectors because they think poker is about ""getting it in with the best hand"" and not about mathematically sound decisions."
poker,3bkakj,window_turnip,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it happens a non-zero amount of the time. My point is shoving is correct if you're always getting called, if they fold sometimes that's even better."
poker,3bk5bq,trashpokerplayer,2,Mon Jun 29 21:50:08 2015 UTC,"Yup.  My $1,000,000,000,000 fake dollars is greater than your $5,000,000 fake dollars.  Just like real poker, but fake."
poker,3bk5bq,Stixx_27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:06 2015 UTC,I'm not talking about a ranking system in terms of who has the most money -_- A win/loss ratio or like an elo rating system
poker,3bk5bq,Stixx_27,2,Mon Jun 29 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"Ya, I know what you're saying.  I don't mean to sound too sarcastic or anything.  But what you're asking for is basically exactly what it is.  Whether it is fake money or real money.  The more you have is just like an ELO system.  Except it's a much more fickle thing.  If I queue up for a game of Dota/cs:go on tilt or not on my A game, the worst that can happen is I lose a little bit of ELO over a few hours.  However, if someone goes on tilt in poker they might blow off their whole bankroll if they lack the self control in a matter of minutes.  The better you do, the higher you bankroll increases.  And a win/loss system might be compared to your win rate over a specific sample size.  ie, your bb/100 win rate (how many big blinds you win on average per 100 hands played).    I remember about a year ago my wife downloaded the wsop app on her iphone to play with fake money.  It had some kind of rank up system, but it was more of a linear progression type system that rewarded you the more you played.  Not necessarily your win/loss ratio.  Because like I said, that's just how much you have."
poker,3bk5bq,Stixx_27,2,Mon Jun 29 22:12:39 2015 UTC,so what you're saying is that there's no alternative to realisitic practicing without actually playing with real money?
poker,3bk5bq,Clarityy,3,Mon Jun 29 22:21:42 2015 UTC,"Correct.  There really isn't.  Playing the lowest stakes (2nl/5nl) possible for real money is leagues ahead of the highest stakes on any play money site.  The only time I would advocate playing for fake money if you goal was to get better would be for someone to literally learn the rules of the game.  Or taking part in 'freeroll' opportunities sites have that you can play in ""no buy-in"" tournaments where the winner gets a ticket to an actual tournament or something like that."

poker,3bhrz1,cobwebscavern,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:33:35 2015 UTC,"Paulson's are great chips no two ways about it but they aren't the only choice and some would say a little over-priced and a little over-rated. The biggest block you will find to getting a set of Paulsons is that they are no longer making chips for the home market.  There are many other choices - http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00Q325GUS?psc=1 - as a suggestion try something like these but make sure of the following...you are buying chips that are 10g or heavier (up to 14g 11g being the ""normal"" weight)....made of ceramic or clay and are one piece (no metal slugs or inserts)...have denominations printed onto the chip and no labels are used...lastly have a nice chip split and denominations:  25, 100, 500, 1k, 5k (Min. add in 10k or 25k)   If buying a 500 set then my suggestion would be 25 = 100, 100 = 150, 500 = 100, 1k = 100, 5k = 50. If you want any higher chips then you can take make 25 = 75 as most companies supply chips in rolls of 25."

How the fuck can chips break and why would you not buy the cheapest ones? You could literally use rocks as chips if you wanted to.
poker,3bhrz1,Stickyballs96,2,Mon Jun 29 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"Some people just like to use the highest quality equipment in their games. I personally have a set of pharaohs that ran me .34ish a chip and couldn't be happier. It didn't break the bank and they are a huge upgrade to the usual dice chips I was playing with in other home games.  Another nice bonus is security. If you are using the cheapest chips from toysRus, what's stopping me from getting the same chips and slowly throwing some on my stack and cashing out for a lot more and screwing you over at the end of the night?   Why do people buy nice cars? That brand new 50k car will get you to your destination just as the 1k 15yr old car you purchased from Johnny down the block.

I think buying nice cars is pretty stupid most of the time but poker chips? I mean with something like a golf ball I see how it can be worth buying the best of the best, correct weight etc because your use of it determines your skill. It doesn't with poker chips though. They are just what you use to place bets. How good your chips feel does not affect anything."

You are chopping with other marginal hands which may have called the flop like KQ or QJ, but would he really bet those hands for value on the river?  He could have floated with Kx or Jx, but I think an aggressive player would have stabbed at the turn if he floated with one of those.    If villain was going to bluff, he would've/should've done it when checked to on the turn.  The turn check behind leads me to think he has something, and pretty much every ""something"" has you beat or, at the very least, will not bet the river if checked to, so check and hope to see a showdown.  Fold if he bets."

poker,3bi75f,withoutatrace123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"But, why would he call the flop lead with a mid pair thinking it may be good, then bluff river when the board didn't change?

poker,3bi1kv,KafkasTrial,4,Mon Jun 29 11:48:59 2015 UTC,There's literally no thinking in hand 1. Villain is playing the board or has a jack. I find it hard to believe he's ever going to slow down with Kxcc or Axcc then hope a T or 5 peels on the river he can jam to look like he's trying to get you off a chop. If he didn't realise he had suits and shows down his KJcc thinking it's a straight bad luck.  Hand 2 I'd be a little worried because there's 2x 5d in the deck.
poker,3bi1kv,RudolfKGB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:35:10 2015 UTC,Sorry hand 2 I switched suites of the 4/5 on the flop. Fixed now.   Hand 1. Yea I figured that such a huge portion of his range on the river is either a J or trying to blow me off a chop with a couple of random 'tricky' played flushes thrown in there (but probably not A high flushes as that raises turn unless he was hoping to raise river and saw the T as an opportunity and only really worried about K high flushes). Can't say I see many overbets at low limit live so I was a bit hesitant but ended up calling to see JTo which is the most logical hand for vil to have based on the story.
poker,3bi1kv,De-Trout-Spinners,2,Mon Jun 29 17:19:11 2015 UTC,i dont think you can make a distinction between the K high flush and the A high flush given the action
poker,3bi1kv,De-Trout-Spinners,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:56:19 2015 UTC,You reckon? Seems like an obvious raise even for weak players to raise the A high flush but I could see him potentially trying to get tricky with both.
poker,3bi1kv,Intotheopen,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:47:33 2015 UTC,Once he ships river there is no distinction between Ahigh and K high for me
poker,3bi1kv,BerryGuns,3,Tue Jun 30 08:16:02 2015 UTC,"1 is snap call.  2 is a fold. Probably preflop, but on the button I GUESS you can make an argument for a call."

poker,3bi1kv,BerryGuns,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:24:58 2015 UTC,Because it's 1/3 and we aren't beating anything.  Or do you mean on the button pre-flop.
poker,3bi1kv,Intotheopen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:34:39 2015 UTC,What does because it's 1/3 mean? What do we lose to?
poker,3bi1kv,BerryGuns,2,Mon Jun 29 15:36:07 2015 UTC,"Tight passive has a ton of better aces, he probably calls with those. Drunk easily can have backdoor flushes, Q5, a bunch of other weird 2 pairs. I just don't like the call with the guy behind.  It's not air and a fold often enough. I don't think were good 1/3 here, and that's before the nit calls. If he calls we definitely aren't good 1/5ish."

poker,3bi1kv,horizoner,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:48:29 2015 UTC,I read the river wrong. It's probably a call hoping to chop...  That still doesn't make me thrilled though.

poker,3bi1kv,Intotheopen,2,Mon Jun 29 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Hand 1 - I'm not really playing Q3s, but this looks like he thinks you are playing the board now and wants to push you off a chop or he has a higher straight and he thinks you can't fold. I would assume he's CRing the turn with a bigger flush.  Hand 2 - I fold this pre, small suited aces up in early position are only going to get you in trouble. Then when a tight passive nit bets out on the flop, I fold. The river you are at best chopping."

You play Q3cc in late position for the flush value.  You got there, so call the bet.  If you're not comfortable with the decision, fold pre.  You will lose some of the time, for sure.

poker,3bi1kv,Four_Months,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:58:29 2015 UTC,I can understand hand 2 being a snap if we're closing the action but I feel like tight passive muddies it up for us because of how often he chops with us. I do feel like we were smashing drunks range ( and tight passive was folding similar spots) so I ended up calling as did tight passive and got shown A6dd by drunk and A3o by tight passive.

poker,3bi1kv,Four_Months,0,Mon Jun 29 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Hand 1 call. If you lost to a better flush then so be it.  Hand 2 fold, UTG betting into 3 people is strong, and him continuing on turn makes it sure you're beaten."

Why limp in for Two Bucks with marginal hands thrusting yourself into marginal spots facing $90 river bets for $7.236837 in +EV, when you can just sit back and wait, and in the next 2 or 3 hours, win their entire stack with the absolute nuts?"

poker,3bi1kv,BerryGuns,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:25:56 2015 UTC,"You just have to have the discipline to fold TPNK.   Which means you are throwing in $3 hoping for a 16 to 1 shot of hitting the flush.   So you've got to get paid at least $50 when you do hit to break even.  And you only have two people to extract this $50 or more from when it does hit, it's not like you have the usual 4 or 5 limpers, one of which might also have something and pay you off.

poker,3bi9ht,ILikeAllThings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:06:45 2015 UTC,Playing in position is a great advantage that you should use.  Getting into situations OOP can be really costly - there are probably many parts of your poker game you can improve on before you get to playing a loose range in early position.  Here are the types of games I like to loosen up in UTG and UTG+1: 3 handed games & 4 handed games.
poker,3bi9ht,ILikeAllThings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"Ahah, this was a very good reply."
poker,3bi9ht,ILikeAllThings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Incidentally, this made me think of the one game where I was straddling every rotation(a straddle is a blind raise UTG for those who haven't seen this, I think only acceptable in live games).  I was playing 3 handed, and I basically raised the button every hand before I got my cards.  It was a limit holdem game, and the straddle gave me position on every round, including preflop.  Didn't hurt much that there was a drunk guy in the game and a passive nit."
poker,3bi9ht,Four_Months,0,Mon Jun 29 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"I may have misread but straddling is not confined to UTG if rules permit, and I would not suggest straddling when you will be OOP post flop."
poker,3bi9ht,Four_Months,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:30:16 2015 UTC,"Some card houses allowed non-UTG straddling, but I've never encountered that in Limit Hold'em, only No Limit Hold'em games.  Yeah, the only place I would straddle in OTB if possible.  A few places around where I live allow this in NL."

poker,3bi5oi,flipperstf,2,Mon Jun 29 12:47:46 2015 UTC,This is how I feel as well. I typically btw dont play till broke. I used to when I first started online. Even after horrendous beats I would stay at the table trying to break even or something. I have found that for me this is a losing strategy. It hasn't been all roses.   Last week for instance I walked away with 400 dollars (-200 from what I started with.) and it would have been the largest cash game winnings to date.   I sat down at 2/5 and actually decided not to play the 150 as I had amassed 1900 dollars in 4 hours. I got a guy with 2100 to call an all in bet where I had trips on the flop (9's). Raised preflop to 100 he calls. Flop is 9 4 2. I checked the guy tried to bluff me with by firing out 400. I think for 2 minutes then call. next card is a 5. I check he goes all in. I ofcourse insta call and the pot ended up being 3800 hundred dollars. This is a huge win for me. The guy rebuys back in for 3k.   Next hand I have pocket aces. Same idiot goes all in against me perflop I call thinking holy shit this is amazing. I'm about to make 6k at 2/5. He cracks my aces with 9 10 off suit hitting two pair on the river. I'm left with 800. I then lose another 4 to one favorite leaving me with 400 dollars. I literally got up and just left the table as I felt there was no way I was going to play well after this. So again its not like I'm just smashing flops and getting lucky on coin flips ect.

poker,3bi5oi,BeatDownSnitches,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:33:37 2015 UTC,trips is when the board pairs and you have one  the cards. example: u have A9 and flop comes 995. you flopped trip 9s. A set is when u have a pocket pair and and get a third card frm the board. Ex: u have 99 and the flop comes 934. top set

poker,3bi5oi,Intotheopen,3,Mon Jun 29 12:47:44 2015 UTC,You are on a massive heater. MTT by nature have far higher variance than this.
poker,3bi5oi,MathW,2,Mon Jun 29 13:22:01 2015 UTC,"I assume you know you won't be winning at the same rate over the long term.  The win rates you described are over a small sample size (12 tournaments and ~1500 cash game hands), but it seems likely (although not guaranteed) that you are at least a winning player in these games.  If that's the case, 18k is more than enough to avoid any significant risk of losing your whole bankroll at 1/2 and $150 tournaments.  As far as a secondary income.  Since you only play once a week and 4 times a month, your monthly # of hands/tournaments will be so small (relatively speaking), I don't think you can depend on any regular income from it. You could go conceivably go several months (or maybe a year or more) of breakeven or negative results.  Of course, the breakeven results will be interspersed with periods where you are raking in money like you are now.  So, as something fun to do that will bring in some extra cash that you can spend on some toys or vacations -- yes....but, I wouldn't depend on it as a regular source of income (say..for a mortgage payment) unless you have a large amount of savings you can tap into (without hitting your poker bankroll) during a breakeven stretch."
poker,3bi5oi,cobwebscavern,4,Mon Jun 29 13:46:56 2015 UTC,My question though is this normal?   I doubt it. I am in the UK so play differs here but still...You are up 18k in 3 months = ~$70k PA? That would be an amazing return for a one day a week player.   My thoughts are if this is on the up and up that you are on a super sick heater.....the sample size is still pretty small overall and still well within variance for it all to come crashing down....Enjoy it but be prepared for a downswing and use good BRM.   You could try moving up to bigger action and goo dluck if you do but matey if you can hold that all together and keep that level of play and ROI consistent I would be tempted to hold tight and see where you sit after 6 months/1 year.

I highly doubt a $150 tournament can be profitable no matter how good you are. The rake on low buy-in tournaments like that usually can not be beat over any meaningful sample size."

poker,3bg5lc,Touch_Of_Red,7,Mon Jun 29 08:12:18 2015 UTC,The GTO play is to grind a job (ideally a job that pays you more than $150/wk) while playing/studying poker as sort of a part time job.  That way your bills are paid and you can grind up your roll without taking much out.  After a year or two you'll have the experience to better decide if you want to play poker full time and if you do you'll have a bankroll to play stakes large enough to live off of and a liferoll to protect against downswings/get yourself settled.
poker,3bg5lc,JoeFlacco05,2,Mon Jun 29 00:18:07 2015 UTC,Exactly what I'm doing right now. I slashed my hours in half at work (was working full time) and now I spend my free time grinding 1/2 live and studying.

poker,3bg5lc,PokerDividends,2,Mon Jun 29 09:35:21 2015 UTC,yeah in your situation def better to take guaranteed pay + benefits. people always forget about health insurance and pension/401k benefits of jobs.  poker players dont have many retirement plans...
poker,3bg5lc,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sort of plays into the experience I'm talking about, you have to balance everything in your life to find out what works best for you, and for a lot of people it isn't poker.  For example, if you offered me 1.3x my yearly average to stop playing poker and grind a desk job, I'd probably turn it down because I enjoy playing poker and would hate a regular job.

poker,3bg5lc,IAmArag0rn,3,Tue Jun 30 05:58:25 2015 UTC,"I quit my job in tech sales to play poker - was backed and had a couple good months ~2007. Thought I understood variance/volume/earnings and assumed I would be printing money if I quit my job since I can play more! I was also miserable in my job but made decent money.  I was a 'pro' before I understood what it takes to be a professional. The games were soft and I had a couple good months but really had no idea of variance, emotional control and the stress of playing a silly game of cards for a living. I failed miserably and learned the hard way. Got dropped...depressed..no job..no bankroll and most of all..no balance.   I worked a couple odd jobs, put in a ton of time learning/studying, and hit some positive variance.  What started with an 8k bink, I managed to win ~150k over the next year. I played for a living for the next 4 years with moderate success. Made good money, had freedom to do what I want, and traveled to some pretty cool places. I luckboxed early and it had nothing to do with my skills really. It was positive variance.  Fast forward to now, I play poker part time and still make decent money - in fact, I've made more from poker than my job over the past 4 months but I just never felt fulfilled from poker and it affected me.  Without knowing anything about your situation I would say don't quit your job and focus on an applicable skill that will get you ahead. For the vast majority of people investing in your career/skillset will be much more  +EV than playing poker. Odds are, you are never going to be a crusher and poker should be nothing more than a somewhat profitable past time. Go back to school, learn a skill in a relevant industry but don't quit your day job."

poker,3bg5lc,TeddyMurphski,2,Mon Jun 29 17:12:14 2015 UTC,"My standard advice for players living in your more expensive countries, is to find a way to support yourself WHILE you play OTHER than poker until you hit 100NL. Also, don't withdraw until you hit 100NL either, so you build your roll as quickly as you can. Here are more tips on bankroll management."
poker,3bg5lc,The-Doctor-94,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"How much can you expect to make from professional poker with an average win rate? I've only been playing for about 6 months, but I've grinded from 2nl to 50nl and I expect to be at 100nl in maybe a month or two if things go smoothly. On the other hand I'm entering my last year of Uni studying for a CS degree so I was considering withdrawing my money to use elsewhere so I can fully focus on school. Will my degree always be more profitable than poker?"
poker,3bg5lc,Geo_Hon,2,Sun Jun 28 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can really answer those questions. But if you feel like you should withdraw the money to use on life expenses, that's definitely not a bad idea. Your computer science degree definitely has a more stable equity, plus as somebody above mentioned, playing poker professionally has the disadvantage of creating a hole in your resume.   I'd suggest keeping poker as a side thing for a while."
poker,3bg5lc,TeddyMurphski,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"Your degree will certainly give you a job where experience leads to higher pay.  While in poker you would have to rely on getting even better or moving to higher stakes to get growth of income - but this has a cap. It is life +$ev to focus on your career, especially as you are starting out.  Feel free to cash out your roll.  Pokers not going anywhere and you can always deposit again in the future/keep a small roll when you withdraw."
poker,3bg5lc,PokerDividends,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:39:50 2015 UTC,"This is true, I'm just afraid if I take time off I will lose my edge. Also there seems to be a good opportunity because 50nl on my site is surprisingly soft and a lot of the same players are at 100nl. But I'm also afraid if I were to one day play in Pokerstars (im in the US), I would be behind the curve. The biggest thing that discourages me about the game though is I never know when the next downswing will be or how bad it will be. This month I was at $300 under ev at 20nl. Downswings are stressful and although I'm still able to play my A game in spite of these.   I feel like it's not such a bad idea to take my money and take a break for now. I'll treat myself to something nice and concentrate on my last year of school. Like you said, it will be there later so I can also deposit a decent starting roll know I can win at the game."
poker,3bg5lc,PokerDividends,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:51:48 2015 UTC,"your degree will offer far more stability than poker. guaranteed income and benefits far outweigh being a pro at 100nl. If i were you, I would keep practicing, studying and playing poker. Focus on your potential career though and get a good paying job. Invest in your 401k options and you will have poker as side income. You can easily make 40k+ a year in that field and even over 100k. Play poker on the side and move up stakes aggressively. You will be living the life man if you keep doing what you do! remember that poker players dont get pensions or 401ks or sick days or health insurance(huge expense)."
poker,3bg5lc,TeddyMurphski,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:25:45 2015 UTC,and having a CS job as your primary income will make you look better to potential spouses rather than saying you are a 100nl pro.
poker,3bg5lc,PokerDividends,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"This is something I've heavily considered also haha. Tbh I never started this game with going pro in mind and it's not something that seems super appealing to me. Originally I just wanted to prove to myself I could beat 2nl after reading that like 90% of players lose in the long run. 77k hands later I'm at 50nl (-$300 ev so not running hot I think) and the other day I made more money playing 9-5 than at my $12/hr job.  This is why I ask the question, I never saw myself getting this far and now I see there is actually a lot of potential money considering how soft the player field is on my site. But I mean I think about the game 24/7, spend hours studying, and all of the other hours grinding so it's very time consuming.  I think I'm going to take a year off to concentrate on my last year of school and treat myself to something nice. I don't think a year off will kill my game and will return later if Poker can supplement my income as well as you say."

poker,3beo20,rhinointhehouse,2,Sun Jun 28 18:22:55 2015 UTC,There was some card player article 5-10 years ago where it was down to 3 handed and the lady who was being interviewed folded AA pre when the other guys shoved. Her reasoning was that in the long run she'd earn more guaranteeing second than taking the chance and ending up in third or something. I doubt it but does anyone remember this?
poker,3beo20,aRedheaded_Stepchild,2,Mon Jun 29 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"Well, if it was actually the last 3 people, and the other people shoved, then I could see the reasoning, as the difference between 2nd and 3rd is usually a fair share of the prize.  Depending on the stack sizes, I could make the same call. Would probably have to be really short stacked tho, as in would not be the chip leader even if winning the hand."

poker,3bhqzi,pokerhost24,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:17:36 2015 UTC,"Ran your article through Google translate. It is hilarious. Snapping? LMAO.  How to Win Online Poker Gambling June 29, 2015 pokerhost24 Tips and Trick Win Gambling Online Poker Poker Trusted Agent , How to Win Poker Gambling , Gambling Online Poker , Poker Online  Now the game of online poker is very popular and widely played by the world community, including the one of which is Indonesia. Online Poker increasing number of fans this time, the online gambling business also brings these online poker games with real money. Until now many online poker gambling sites were circulating in the internet world.  How to Win Online Poker Gambling  Playing poker is not difficult, but if you do not understand how to play poker, it is recommended you understand how to play poker online in advance. Once you understand how to play poker, the question inevitably arises again in your mind. How to win playing poker? Actually win here is relative and depends on two main things, the first is your luck, and the second is your Hand's Card (2 cards in your hand). Here I try to give tips and ways to win in the version Pokerhost24 play poker gambling.  Tips and How to Win Online Poker Gambling   Make sure your Hand's Card is High Card Hand's Card are two cards you have when the game starts. Hand's Card is very influential on the card that will be shown in the table. Make sure you have the card is a card with a high value. For example here if possible 2 card you have is Ace Pair, Pair Pair King or the other. If not a pair, then the High Card with a value above 9 is also quite supportive. If Hand's Card you have the appropriate conditions mentioned, then chances are you've won 20% Combine 3 First Card's Card Hand Out with you This is a pretty important thing in playing poker. If the first three cards have been issued, please analysis of possible combinations of cards that may be what you get. Is it generating Straight, Flush, or Fullhouse? Two Pair Is it? If yes, then you should raise the bet. But do All In advance because opponents will be waiting for the next card would think twice to take bets if you are All Inclusive. But if you are still not as good as the combination mentioned above, for example, still less one card to Straight, Flush, Full House or a combination of other high cards, then I suggest you should check or call the number that is being bet. Quiet or Term Playing Poker Face This is a favorite trick of Professional poker player because this trick really needs tranquility. If you already have a combination of high cards at the start of the opening of the three cards on the table, say Full House, or Three Of A Kind, you are required calm and unhurried. You also do not need to raise the stakes, let alone do the All Inclusive. You should just check or call and wait for the other player's turn to up the ante. Well if there have been players who raise the stakes, this is where you start to act. You should increase the value of the bet worth 2x of bets players filed earlier. Well this time the player will certainly follow a bet that you submit, he might even do the All Inclusive. Well you will automatically win a bet with a value many times over. Snapping For this manner is also widely used by professional players. But here I do not advise you to use this way, because this way is quite dangerous and have a big enough risk. We can do it this way if we truly believe that our opponents do not have good cards altogether and will do FOLD. Doing snapping example is when we did not have a good combination of cards on the table until the fifth card is issued and the players are no do-raising bets. So here, we could do the bluff. But the risk is if another player bets and the other player has a card that is better than ours. Then certainly we will suffer great losses. Therefore, for this one trick I do not recommend.   So a few tips and ways to win in online poker gaming, but not always tips and tricks are running 100% and 100% accurate because winning in online poker gaming could be due to the luck factor."

poker,3bh6wq,DatGrag,2,Mon Jun 29 04:47:39 2015 UTC,"Position, need to know your position.  but otherwise Snapcall it's 17 more bb's and you have blockers to Aces and Kings and you're dominating weaker Aces in a race with any other pocket pair."
poker,3bh6wq,redfrags,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"But everyone else had folded so does it still matter about position at that point? I honestly don't remember, I need to get better at worrying about position and working that into my play..  Basically I'm asking is it better to eat the $6 loss or throw another $34 into the pot going in as a 55/45 underdog.  Edit: Also, can you elaborate on what you mean by ""blockers."" I'm guessing you mean that since I have an Ace and a King it lowers the statistical probability that he has pocket As or pocket Ks, both of which would fuck me over pretty hard?"
poker,3bh6wq,redfrags,3,Mon Jun 29 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, if everyone else folded. Didn't read that  If you have no history with villain, it's definitely a call.  Because AKs against a short stack and it is almost always the right play to call a 20bb shove. With 20bb, he can induce a fold from Weaker Aces and he could just holding AJs or some hand like that. Assuming neither of were in the blinds, the pot should be $9 when you open for 3x bb, then he shoves for 40, you're then paying $34 to win a pot of $49   If you know somehow for a fact that you're a 45/55 underdog, accounting for rake, it's a close call but with the math if you come up 45% of the time and if you get back at least $76 (so unless rake is $7 or more here) after rake it's a call. BUT the thing is, he doesn't always have an advantage over you, he could have a small pocket pair or a weaker ace making it closer to 52/48 or 80/20 in those situations, a 20bb shoving range after an open is definitely callable with AKs.  Poker is about making +ev decisions  Equity Value, and that stems not only from the card strength/odds but you take it in account with the pot size and over time the % that you get ahead mathematically is what makes you money.   That and some luck.  And yes that's what a blocker means. :)"
poker,3bh6wq,eyememine,5,Mon Jun 29 05:30:45 2015 UTC,Position does matter. Say if OP raised UTG then the villain shoved next to act it's different if villain did it in the BB. Also if it's folded to OP on the button then that'd matter too
poker,3bh6wq,eyememine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:17:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it definitely matters but in a very subtle way that I am not skilled enough to utilize yet.  I was just trying to see if the ""pot odds"" or whatever you call it is in my favor to call in this situation, which they apparently were."
poker,3bh6wq,eyememine,2,Mon Jun 29 13:59:28 2015 UTC,"That's good, you're putting him on a hand and figuring out the math, that's a good first step. When you're trying to figure out the strength of someone's hand you have to give them more credit if they open/raise from early position as opposed to late because early they have way more potential callers who are going to have position"

I ended up calling and losing, but after reading your post I am confident I made the right decision.  Thanks again."
poker,3bh6wq,gloves22,2,Mon Jun 29 05:40:16 2015 UTC,"Quick tip; in cash games don't think about what you've ""committed"" to the pot because you can always buy more chips, unlike a tournament. You should always be thinking about pot odds at that moment, and never consider yourself pot committed. The $6 you put in belongs to the pot, it's no longer yours. So it's the $6 you put in, the blinds if one or both of you weren't the blinds, plus his $40 minus the rake (no idea what it is online, let's say $1). So it's $6+$3+$40-$1=$48 with $34 to call."

I am in Canada and same time zone, (1 hour from TO) and I have been focusing on 30NL Snap. I do dip into 50NL Snap too but you're right that it's hit or miss on population depending on time. 30NL Snap is usually always running enough players to sit 3 times. I'd give it some a bit more time man, as it gets better once you're used to the software. I've been crushing 30NL snap as of late (11bb/100 over 25K hands, gonna see how it looks after 100K hands though) and plan on just doing that as the players are realllllllyyyyy bad! I wish I had the time to grind the tournaments though. We've probably played over the last few days I'd imagine if you were playing at night. Give it a bit more time though man!"

poker,3bh5ma,flipperstf,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"Of course bro. I've had an account at PS since '07. I'll give a little writeup on how I even got back on 888 instead of PS. So, last year I was doing a BR challenge, $50 and 2NL to start, and I made it up to $850 and 25NL on PS. Hit a big downswing and realized I wasn't ready mentally for cash game (most of my profit comes from MTT and MTTSNG). So I cashed out around $450 and left $50 on PS for when I was ready to start again. Took about 5-6 months off and just studied without playing. Last month about 5 weeks ago, I received an email from 888 saying ""We haven't seen you in a while, here's $10 in your account.""    I figured, it's been 5-6 months off poker, I should be ready to play again, much stronger mentally and some fundamentally as well. Thoughts were to dick away the $10 on 888 and get back to my grind on PS. Decided to play two $5 tourneys with it, and ended up FT'ing one for a $165. Grinded some tourneys up to about $500 over that week (had some time off work). When I returned to work, it was realization time that I HAD to do the cash grind, and be ready for it. Working out great so far, and reading TMGOP has helped drastically. My tilt game is impressing the hell out of me (or lack there of as of late).    I think if I went back to PS right now I would be winning for sure at 25NL, but maybe not at as great of a winrate as 30nls. Player pool is significantly worse as I'm sure you're aware. The tourney structure also suits me well, I consistently can go deep in large field MTT's, so these tourneys with only 80-500 players are very good for me structure wise. Except the lack of time to play them being a grown up with a career and family lol.    Sorry for a little story time there haha, but I think there is easy money to be made. If I can have my winrate stay above 6bb/100 once I hit 100K hands I'd be pretty happy with staying at 888, and jumping in some tourneys when I can find the time. I think you should give it a bit more time before fully dropping the idea. GL."
poker,3bh5ma,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, the run good def helps you make a decision. Also the perks of 888s redeposit/freeroll stuff really helps. It just seems for 50nl it diminishes, and 100nl virtually non existent."
poker,3bh5ma,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"For sure. One silver lining is that 200NL Snap seems to be running pretty consistently, but that's a whole nother beast I won't be going anywhere near until at least an $8K BR and further skill advancements."
poker,3bh5ma,dalonelybaptist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:06:14 2015 UTC,Software doesn't suck you're just used to stars. If 888 software is tilting you bovada would give you an aneurysm.

poker,3bhjr1,POKER_SLUT,3,Mon Jun 29 07:24:04 2015 UTC,Your mentality is too passive. Treat a UTG preflop minraise at cash games to be equal to an open limp. Reraise with AJ. When you flop trips with ok kicker then you should be trying to stack it off against the deepest stack opponent. Bet big on all three streets with the intention of going AI. Basically: attack weaker players with stronger hands.
poker,3bhjr1,withoutatrace123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"Your mentality is too passive. Treat a UTG preflop minraise at cash games to be equal to an open limp. Reraise with AJ.   Can't say I agree with this even at 2nl. People who limp are almost always limp/calling or limp/folding so you can iso them with a range that crushes theirs. A minraise suggests at least some kinda sense to raise, meaning they will react decently to our 3bet. If we have a read that utg is a really weak player then sure, but I would flat as a default.  I agree with postflop obviously"
poker,3bhjr1,Clarityy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"I expect a 4-bet (even a min 4-bet) from premium hands like AA/KK/AK and a call by many hands we're dominating like A6s. I don't expect any folds to my 3-bet so this is simultaneously a bet for information and value. When someone min-raises and it's not his default raise size, then he has polarized his range. At microstakes, his reaction to the 3-bet gives us information that is either going to make us a lot of money or save us a lot of money. If he calls, I expect a lot of folds to my cbet, so bloating the pot pre leads to more profit post. As expected, V1 shows up with A5, a hand we dominate in 70% of confrontations. I'm 90% certain he calls the 3-bet pre with it as well."

poker,3bhj5a,Jd00bz,2,Mon Jun 29 07:15:29 2015 UTC,Many years ago I read that the cards are sorted into bins for each card.  Damaged cards are thrown away.  Then one from each bin is taken to create a full deck of cards in one of the previously used boxes.  I don't know if this is still the case but it makes sense.  The incorrect deck would be the result of someone sorting a [Kh] into the [Kd] sorting bin.
poker,3bhj5a,kidtire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:34:11 2015 UTC,This makes sense. They ended up using a sharpie on one of them to make it a KoD. But at least it's most likely human error VS a casino playing a stacked deck.

poker,3beyu0,jonnyburger,0,Sun Jun 28 19:23:53 2015 UTC,FYI nobody actually ever wants to hear someone's bad beat story.
poker,3beyu0,anonymous7,2,Sun Jun 28 20:41:13 2015 UTC,therefore you post it in a low quality daily discussion thread
poker,3beyu0,lyndis,2,Sun Jun 28 20:52:21 2015 UTC,I like both ideas! Why not have a topic everyday of the week except on one day where everything poker related is allowed?
poker,3beyu0,Stevenab87,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:58:37 2015 UTC,Great idea!
poker,3beyu0,Stevenab87,2,Sun Jun 28 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Combination of both: give the thread a nominal topic, but let people discuss whatever they like!"
poker,3bhgb3,sbjacket,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:37:57 2015 UTC,Didn't have the sound on but wp you butchered a hand   What did you think would happen when you raised?? lol
poker,3bhgb3,Spacezup,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:21:01 2015 UTC,Is it not against the rules for two people to be working together like that?
poker,3bhgb3,window_turnip,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:16:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is against the TOS. However, please let more people team up and play like this."
poker,3bg4kp,RewdDudes,3,Sun Jun 28 22:43:54 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't fit the classical order but just make the whites the highest denomination chip since that's what you have the most of anyway.  Problem solved however it is unorthodox.  Or, surely between 9 people someone has 20-30 of some item that could be used as ""plaques"" for an extra denomination as well!  I've done this with beer coasters for example."
poker,3bg4kp,andrew7895,2,Mon Jun 29 03:39:48 2015 UTC,Full ring? Get more chips.
poker,3bg4kp,Khronoxxx,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:54:32 2015 UTC,Highest possible game that would be good?
poker,3bg4kp,DannyOcean148,2,Sun Jun 28 22:57:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say 4-max with 2/2 (or 5/5, just gotta be the same) blinds.  20/white/2$  10/red/5$  10/blue/10$  Amounts to 190$ per person but no extra for rebuys.  You could add 20$ and 50$ bills or something like that, but it might be easier to just buy more chips."
poker,3bg4kp,RudolfKGB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:44:40 2015 UTC,Using actual money for a cash game is a great way to get by with less chips. You could just have the chips being worth $1/$2/$5 so there's plenty of change for the blinds and smaller bets then use cash for the majority of the stacks. Everyone can start with like $20 in change then whatever they buy in for in cash.
poker,3bg4kp,Stevenab87,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"what do you mean by ""highest possible game""?"
poker,3bg4kp,Stevenab87,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:38:56 2015 UTC,Highest amount of players for NLHE
poker,3bg4kp,RudolfKGB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:58:35 2015 UTC,Could you just use coins or something else for makeshift chips?
poker,3bg4kp,RudolfKGB,2,Mon Jun 29 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'd probably use that to fill for chips, i.e pennies = whites, nickles = blues, etc."
poker,3bfyi6,RegiTime,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"In this podcast, I talk a lot about my background and my approach to poker.  I think it's interesting but I guess I would say that!"
poker,3bg9yl,horizoner,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:31:37 2015 UTC,"H1 : as played check fold every street, consider jamming pre if villains are bad enough to call of with AJ or other worse hands.  H2: fold turn"
poker,3bg9yl,flipperstf,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:57:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. That's how I basically played them.
poker,3bg9yl,Spewymcgewy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:17:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the hands just the first part, because your thinking is a tad off. Fixing your thought process will improve your game dramatically.   Okay so on bovada you aren't going to have solid reads on anyone. Instead of arbitrarily categorizing people after 15 hands instead try to create a default 100bb strategy to use against unknowns.   Then once you have a solid read on the population and create a solid default strategy... Time to adjust.   So now when you see the 70 bb stack cold call a 3 bet with KTs and call down 3 barrels with 1 pair. You can adjust from your default strategy and start value betting him wider, 3 betting more etc. since you've seen that he won't adjust/make big mistakes.   Edit: Also your image doesn't matter. People are thinking only about their cards."
poker,3bg9yl,withoutatrace123,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:05:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response man. I've been trying to hand read way too much the last few sessions that I've played. I'll try to hammer a general strat out. Cheers.
poker,3bg9yl,RunChan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:26:07 2015 UTC,"Hand 1   Learn to play with a full stack. If you're going to play a 30bb stack then learn proper shortstack strategy. Applying 2, you should just 3-bet shove from BB instead of raising to 0.80$. As played check-fold every street.   Hand 2   Fold pre or raise more. Check flop with TPNK on dry board. Fold turn to raise on dry board. He's repping sets minus QQ, 56 and nothing.  Fold river because we should have folded turn."
poker,3bgsvc,Ineeditunesalot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:27:04 2015 UTC,"Is your current cash balance $100 or $30?  The rollover is 3X poker points on $100 for the friend bonus so you have to earn 300 points from now before you can withdraw.  It's 6X on $20+$10 for the 50% match bonus so 180 points that will be part of the 300 earned.  Your current 53 points and any used points count toward the 180 rollover, and future earned points count toward both the 180 and 300 rollovers."
poker,3bgsvc,lyndis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:29:05 2015 UTC,What's the quickest/safest way to earn points?   Edit: current is 100$ from my dad depositing 100 to his and me getting the referral bonus.
poker,3bgsvc,Touch_Of_Red,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:44:16 2015 UTC,Play the game that you are the best at.

poker,3bgsvc,PokerDividends,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"How many poker points have you earned, including used?  I'm assuming $30 is what you're currently allowed to withdraw by Bovada depending on what you've met for rollover."
poker,3bggia,Mezmerial,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:32:21 2015 UTC,Ehh playing 1/2 or 1/3 live youll get looked up by AQ/AJ there quite a bit as well.
poker,3bggia,JoeFlacco05,0,Mon Jun 29 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"I really should have reloaded, but the only reason I was at that particular casino was because I was right around the corner from it. I was pretty upset and had intended just just leave, but the AA were delt to me and I figured I could turn things around.  I'm thinking if I would have made the $60 bet instead of the $100 bet, the overall out come of that hand would have been better for me.   Either: A) he would have called the $60 reducing my losses. Or B) he would have went all in and I would have had a tougher time calling it."
poker,3bggia,rockandchalkin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:16:29 2015 UTC,So you're opening about 8x the blinds?
poker,3bfocr,GuthixsCat,3,Sun Jun 28 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought this specific pack, but I bought the turbo masters pack from HUSNG. It's kind of meh in my opinion. There is good stuff but I am really not a fan of essentially just watching a powerpoint for a lot of the time. I always find the live play + commentary is the best so I'd try to look for a pack that's heavy on that sort of content."
poker,3bfocr,Ckaine8,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:22 2015 UTC,I think /u/myimportantthoughts knows about this sort of thing
poker,3bfocr,window_turnip,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought it, I have some of their other stuff. Would recommend getting cheaper basic pack first and working through that.  No idea what stakes you play, if you play $15s then I would get it but not if you are playing $3s."
poker,3bfocr,myimportantthoughts,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:03:33 2015 UTC,Ok well I play the one you didn't mention lol. What do you think of them for that?
poker,3bfocr,myimportantthoughts,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:24:14 2015 UTC,"The basic pack for $60 IIRC is definitely worth it IMO if you play $7s, and if you are serious about moving up then probably get another one after that. Advanced pack def not required to solidly beat $7s."

poker,3bfocr,GrayFaceNoSpace,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:16 2015 UTC,that pack is really outdated but will still be good at lower stakes aka 10-20
