Bed bugs actively seek out a blood meal. And they do not thrive outside of an environment close to a person (aka a furniture warehouse).   Now, if this was recently used furniture that was repossessed from a home with a serious infestation, it is possible. Otherwise, you could have picked up bed bugs from literally anywhere, even the CTA. If you would like, I have time today to stop by and give it a look. Message me if you are interested."
chicago,3e27yh,eighmie,13,Tue Jul 21 14:09:10 2015 UTC,"If the company removes old bedding from customers homes during delivery runs,  the bugs could have transferred from an old mattress or box spring to the new mattress or box spring."

chicago,3e27yh,bradatlarge,5,Tue Jul 21 18:41:07 2015 UTC,Is there something that the average Joe or Jane can do to PREVENT them infesting / hitchhiking / etc so we don't have to enlist a professional later to remediate the issue?
chicago,3e27yh,_transatlantique,5,Tue Jul 21 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"We just dealt with an infestation and these are my takeaways: bedbug covers for your mattresses, never get into bed in clothes you wore out (also couch) and use a smooth sided plastic tub for dirty laundry. White sheets, if you see any blood spots on them, check everything."

We were bedbug free for a year and all of a sudden I found one (I inspect every time I change the sheets)...no bites on us (and last time I did...I react very strongly to every bug bite I've ever had) so I think this is a new infestation
chicago,3e27yh,theserpentsmiles,4,Tue Jul 21 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Whatever ""professional"" told you that bed bugs do not travel is a god damn moron. But that isn't too surprising. I had a City of Chicago Streets & Sanitation ""Official"" tell a customer of mine that Rats won't climb."

chicago,3e27yh,eighmie,21,Tue Jul 21 12:44:28 2015 UTC,You both could be right:   They did not originate from your place. The box spring did indeed pass inspection.   Game that out in your head.
chicago,3e27yh,_transatlantique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"One scenario that I could see happening is that ArtVan uses a delivery truck to deliver the mattresses to all of their customers.  Art Van likely uses the same delivery truck to remove the mattresses they are replacing from a customer's home. The Bed bugs came from one of the old mattresses they removed.  The mattress may well have passed the inspection at the warehouse, but the bed bugs jumped onto the new mattress in the truck.    Art Van needs to inspect the truck that delivered the mattress to your home.  You need to isolate that mattress from your home.  Triple bag it and start washing everything you own in HOT water.  I mean everything and dry it on the hottest heat.  Get diatomaceous earth and spread it around the perimeter of your apartment and get bed bug proof covers for your pillows and mattresses."
chicago,3e27yh,eighmie,5,Tue Jul 21 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"Do not get diatomaceous earth, because its terrible for you to inhale and really ineffective. CimeXa. You want an amorphous sillica to spread around.  Edit: go ahead and downvoted me. We had a nasty infestation gone in a matter of weeks. Do you want the stuff that takes over two weeks to kill them (and even then often doesn't) or the stuff that kills them within 48 hours? Head on over to /r/bedbugs if you think I'm full of it."
chicago,3e27yh,_transatlantique,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:07 2015 UTC,diatomaceous earth is sillica.
chicago,3e27yh,maluminse,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"CimeXa is amorphous rather than crystalline and works significantly better with fewer health hazards. CimeXa kills in 48 hours, DE takes up to 18 days."

If that's not possible, get the furniture replaced.  Don't sign anything they give you.  Once you have your refund and/or bedbug-free furniture, contact local news, post on their Facebook page, twitter, whatever.  Make it known.  Places that spread bedbugs because ignoring the problem is cheaper in the short term than destroying inventory and paying for cleaning are part of the problem in Chicago's bedbug infestation."

chicago,3e27yh,Mrg13,7,Tue Jul 21 14:39:19 2015 UTC,"Art Van, and all of the 3rd party companies that they use are horrible. It would not surprise me that you picked up some critters from their products or via one of their 3rd parties.  I will never do business with them and have told everyone that is in the market for furniture to avoid them at all costs!  When the delivery folks came to my place one of them put a huge hole in my freshly painted wall with a chair leg.  The guy who did it then proceeded to try to give me a $40 cash payment so that his manager wouldn't find out.  Took 3 months and numerous phone calls to pry the $75 that it cost to patch and repaint the wall from Corey companies, their 3rd party delivery service that they are using.  We then had an issue when trying to redeem a warranty purchased for our Art Van coffee table.  They sent a repair person out and he said that they would send me a new table top and to call him back so he could come out to install it.  A few weeks went by and no table top showed up.  After calling them it turns out that Art Van couldn't just order the table top from the manufacturer, so they decided it would be too expensive and no longer would warranty it.  When I pressed them, they hid behind their 3rd party and said that the repair man should have never told me they would send a new table top.  Had to buy a whole new table from them.  TL;DR: Art Van put a hole through my wall and took forever to cut a check to fix the issue, and then screwed me on a warranty and didn't pay for a new table top."

chicago,3e27yh,_transatlantique,3,Tue Jul 21 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"So I'm a bed bug survivor. Its seriously a thing (at least I feel it is because it is a huge emotional roller coaster that you'll never fully get over - have fun traveling from now on...). BBs can come from anywhere. My wife is a teacher and a student most likely hugged her and bam we got them. We hadn't had them in over a year and her sister got them (she is a neat freak in a very very rich town - her home is immaculate), and she very much suspected it was us until recently when it came out that one of her friends ignored the problem in her own home and her daughter was constantly over at their house. My point is you'll never know for sure and even if you think you do, it could totally be someone who has them and doesn't know it or won't tell you - and you have contact with them. You feel shameful when you have them and people tend to stay tight lipped on it. Don't try to treat it yourself. Instantly hire a professional and get it taken care of, and have them come back once or twice. We are now bed bug free for almost two years but we are for sure forever scared. Good luck."

Haven't been this excited for a festival in a while. Lollapaloozea lineup has gotten less interesting to me (still good and fun..... just not worth the cost) and Pitchfork has also lost some of my interest lately as well. RIOT FEST has all the random bands I've been wanting to see for years but missed the chance.   Rodrigo y Gabriella Eagles of Death Metal Tenacious D Swervedriver (huge shoegaze fan) System of a Down Snoop Dog Ice Cube The Dear Hunter again. Was fantastic but walked into a concert late when he was finishing.  Modest Mouse Again A bunch of solid 80s and early 90s bands I don't know too well but are really interesting picks.   Does riot fest have two headliners usually? so last two bands conflict?

chicago,3e36t6,mattfromchicago,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"I really did not expect this program to be as successful as it has been,  but it brings me joy that more and more people are biking and the City is taking steps to cater more toward bikers.  Every year, I see more and more people biking to work and this is an overall good thing."
chicago,3e36t6,urbaneyezcom,6,Tue Jul 21 17:38:59 2015 UTC,"Divvy is still spending more than it brings in, and its operating losses are growing.  It is cash positive due to the sponsorship, but to say it is making money isn't really correct."
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:23 2015 UTC,"If you had read the piece you would know ...   ... Divvy is in the black, thanks to its $12.5 million, five-year sponsorship deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, plus income from advertising placards on the docking stations. “The overall system revenue… brings in income to Divvy and the city’s bike programs. Overall Divvy is not losing money. CDOT is investing the revenue from Divvy in bike infrastructure improvements such as bike lanes, bicycle safety education and other programs that benefit the entire City of Chicago, not just Divvy users.”   So yes, if you ignore the sponsorship and Ad revenue Divvy is losing money but if you actually look at all of Divvy's revenue it is in the black."
chicago,3e36t6,BDB_JCD,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Sponsorship and ad revenue isn't seed money.  It's revenue.  If Divvy has an issue, it's that a lot of their eggs are in that one basket.  They better stay real close to BCBS, hope their sponsor doesn't need to start cutting costs, and they better have a plan B if that relationship goes south."
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:20 2015 UTC,I am talking about operating income versus operating expenses.  Those are still far in the red and growing.  A 4x increase Y-O-Y.  That isn't close to being in the black.  Spending less than your operating income is needed for it to become self sufficient.
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"It launched in 2013 in June, and posted an operating loss of 171k, and a 500k loss in 2014 the first full year it operated.  It's still ramping up infrastructure and ridership during that entire period.   So to say it's ""growing"" is technically correct, but ignores a whole lot of really important context."
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"So to say it's ""growing"" is technically correct, but ignores a whole lot of really important context.   I don't disagree.  But, that is way more honest than saying it is operating ""in the black"" like the article claims."
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't reviewed their P/L, so I can't really comment on whether or not they're actually ""in the black"" in the technical accounting sense, but if the variable we're talking about is sponsorship money, then it really isn't inaccurate.  Sponsorship and Ad revenue are revenue.  You might believe that they're less stable revenue than fares and we could debate that.  You might question whether or not a business model that relies on them is sustainable.  We could debate that too.  But they are revenue and at the end of the day there's profit left over for CDOT to invest (we could also debate whether or not that makes sense vs keeping it as cash on hand).  But ""in the black"" is ""all revenue minus all cost"" not ""all fares minus all cost"" with other revenue sources relegated to second-class status."
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,4,Tue Jul 21 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"But ""in the black"" is ""all revenue minus all cost"" not ""all fares minus all cost"" with other revenue sources relegated to second-class status.   That isn't how the Divvy contract works to my knowledge.  BCBS pays the city for Divvy sponsorship.  However, the city has to pay the operator of the Divvy network based on operation expenses versus income.  Because operational expense are in the red, the city has to pay out.  The goal of Divvy was to operate the system itself in the black--so the city didn't have to make vendor payouts."
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, fair enough.  Functionally it's not all that different, but I do understand the distinction.   And even so, it sounds like it's a net positive for the city all around.  It's ""profitable"" for the city almost immediately, and it has some big social benefits (idiots on the sidewalks by navy pier notwithstanding)."
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"This is what people don't realize with startups. Sponsorships and venture capital make up most if not all of their revenue. Once that money fountain disappears, most don't remain solvent."
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,5,Tue Jul 21 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"VC and Sponsorships are two completely different things.  The former eventually dries up, because it's an investment in future profit.  The latter is a form of advertising, and can be a part of a viable long term business model (see: every single business in the entertainment industry)"
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,0,Tue Jul 21 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"I discussed this below. Relying on sponsorship has sunk many theatres and newspapers. It's not a viably reliable long term revenue stream, especially if being a billboard isn't your primary mode of business (which for a biking sharing service is not)."
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,5,Tue Jul 21 17:53:21 2015 UTC,"Actually newspapers did great as an ad supported business for decades.  The internet sunk newspapers.  People not reading newspapers sunk newspapers.  Advertisers won't pay to not be seen. And many theaters do fine in an ad supported model.  Poorly attended ones don't.  But no one is suggesting that ALL of Divvy's revenue should come from sponsorships.  But as long as there's enough ridership to keep bikes on the road, there will be docking stations featuring out of home advertising (an $8bil industry in the US).   And that OOH advertising doesn't just reach riders, it reaches everyone in the (mostly high density, high traffic) neighborhoods.  So yeah... they can count on that revenue continuing to exist.  The BCBS sponsorship is a little more risky, since it can be revoked, but there's a lot of safety in a 5 year deal.  If year 4 rolls around and renewal talks don't go well... sure that's dangerous.  But presumably they have people in place to keep the deal alive or replace it.   But my main point is You can't lump VC and sponsorship money as being the same thing.  Thinking VC will last forever is dumb.  But LOTS of businesses depend on sponsorship money as part of their growth and survival strategies (including the things that replaced your examples, namely television and web-based media)."
chicago,3e36t6,NotTurkWendell,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"So I guess your point is if you just ignore certain revenue streams, they aren't making money?  You probably could say that for.. Everything?"
chicago,3e36t6,hobbituary,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"You didn't read the article you posted apparently.  It clearly stated that the program's stated goals are self sufficiency.  Revenue that brings the program into the black and comes from sponsors is not self sufficient.  Spin it how you'd like, even though sponsorships generally should be counted as revenue Divvy does not want to rely on them at the end of the day."
chicago,3e36t6,hobbituary,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"This is such a ridiculous argument, you're even contradicting yourself in your own post.  This isn't start-up funding or a loan that BCBS gave Divvy, this is straight-up revenue in which they get a tangible asset back, namely, advertising plastered on every bike, van, and station which covers something like 50% of the city (and growing).  I get that the deal has an end date, but that's true of any advertising deal in any industry and I certainly don't see anyone out there calling on any other organization to simply ignore their ad-generated revenue when figuring out their books.  All of this bikeshare network stuff is relatively new and unknown, you have just as much information to contend that the BCBS deal will die in a few years as I do to suggest that this could be a long-term, fruitful partnership for years.  It's ad money, and it's money that has allowed Divvy to stay in the black while they fine tune their pricing strategy so that hopefully in a year or so they are not dependent on the ad money to stay afloat.  Even if they only hit about 65% of the projected annual revenue bump from the increased 24 hour pass price, they will cover the deficit that exists from solely their bike operations."
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,0,Tue Jul 21 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of my post, but that's fine.  Your conclusion is what /u/mandrsn1 and I are saying as well."
chicago,3e36t6,mandrsn1,3,Tue Jul 21 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"It's ad money, and it's money that has allowed Divvy to stay in the black   You're comparing apples to oranges.  The deal the city has with the Divvy operator is for the operations of Divvy.  Sponsorships are not counted in that.  Thus, the Divvy operation is in the red and the city has to pay to to Alta Bicycle Share for this difference.  The operation of Divvy is supposed to be self sustainable.  BCBS is paying chicago to sponsor Divvy, thus that revenue isn't part of the operating balance sheet."
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,0,Tue Jul 21 20:06:30 2015 UTC,"No. I'm saying their operating income is less than thirty operating expenses. And, as the article says, that gap is growing."
chicago,3e36t6,ProfessorPedro,3,Tue Jul 21 17:10:42 2015 UTC,Those are not reliable revenue streams. Let's say your mother randomly gives you a thousand dollars. Should I reference that as a revenue stream the same way you'd reference your salary?
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,5,Tue Jul 21 17:12:48 2015 UTC,Not the same thing.  Ad sales revenue is calculated into the business model of countless businesses.

chicago,3e36t6,_Guinness,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what your point is.
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a gift from BCBS, it's branded sponsorship of a citywide infrastructure program.  That's like saying the CTA shouldn't rely on the $30 million it gets every year from advertising because it's not a reliable revenue stream."
chicago,3e36t6,BDB_JCD,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah its a little weird. I could understand the whole ""not reliable revenue stream"" IF BCBS was giving money to Divvy in exchange for something like equity. That would put the deal on par with ""venture capital"".  But that isn't what is going on here. This is more like when the Cubs bring in revenue by being sponsored by Old Style or Budweiser for being ""The official beer of the Chicago Cubs"". That is absolutely revenue which you don't consider ""unreliable"".  Furthermore, I do not see BCBS abandoning its paltry 2.5mm/year sponsorship. BCBS was obviously smart and had some quants calculate the long term healthcare savings they would generate by getting all of our fat asses on a bike.  Not only does BCBS give money to Divvy but they also heavily subsidize yearly memberships through many workplaces. That is just how much they want you on these bikes.  tl;dr ya'll fat and riding divvy will save BCBS in long term insurance costs. Divvy isn't selling bike rides. They're selling increased health. YOU are the product."
chicago,3e36t6,deadmandrawing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:24 2015 UTC,"This business model is actually why theatres and journalistic outlets struggle to survive (and more and more of them are failing today).

A lot of parents out there are paying money out of pocket to send their kids to Catholic / parochial schools while still paying for government schools.  I suspect that if more parents were able to shift money around to schools they like, we'd have a more accurate picture as to whether it was the parents, the schools, or the system that was causing problems.

Schools in the suburbs are not better because of money...it's because there are more stable family environments.

While that number should be low (because cops should be justified in their shootings), these are already the shootings that are being investigated, meaning the obviously justified ones are probably not included.  1/400 after reversing many of his findings?  And they are calling him biased?"
chicago,3dyl6l,ottothecow,50,Tue Jul 21 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"I practice civil rights law in the City of Chicago. IPRA is a joke, in my experience. I've sued cops who have been sued 7-8 other times in incidents remarkably similar to the subject matter of my lawsuit. One in particular comes to mind: I read some of the transcripts from other cases, and it was like the guy operated off of a (bad) script. Total asshole. And he's still being paid by the good people of this subreddit to provide (what CPD calls) a service to the City of Chicago.   Inevitably, when you file a civil rights Complaint (that is, a Complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983) IPRA will call you (that is, me, the attorney) in order to get information so that they can do an investigation into the conduct of the police officer. If I give them any information, it will be used in the City's defense of the police officer. I'm not stupid, and I'd like to try to avoid a malpractice suit if I can, so I don't offer free evidence to my opponent outside of the regular discovery practice that occurs in every federal lawsuit.   IPRA will always threaten that if I want the City to take action against the officer, I have to give them information. That's stupid. I'm going to end up giving plenty of information to the City through discovery (interrogatories, depositions, document requests, etc.) It isn't like IPRA doesn't have access to this stuff. If they wanted to take action against bad officers, they could do so very easily.  And, here's the crazy part, if they were to let go of the bad cops: 1.) the City would be safer, because folks in heavily policed communities like in South Chicago would have more faith in the police; and 2.) people like me would have to open a restaurant in order to make money, because the City would stop paying out the kind of money it now dedicates to defending civil rights suits, and paying off verdicts and settlements.   /rant."
chicago,3dyl6l,ChicagoEsq,-18,Mon Jul 20 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"Trust me friend. Even losing the bad cops which I agree there are some, aint getting the faith in policing on the south or west sides of Chicago ever restored. At least while in my tenure, and #2 didn't you start by saying you sue cops so doesn't your final statement fall under the reason you have to do that is because of people like yourself?  I'm confused."
chicago,3dyl6l,Sparty_On,25,Mon Jul 20 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"1.) One of the reasons for the distrust is that cops are viewed not as keepers of the peace, or as law-enforcement, but rather people who have license to harass. There are many factors that contribute to that. And my experience gives me insight into one of those factors - certainly not the full cornucopia. I've seen police reports that were so ridiculous, that they would have made me laugh were they not written to cover up beating the shit out of someone. In one case, after cuffing an innocent bystander (who objected to the cops arresting someone who, he believed, had not committed a crime - no idea whether he was right or not), the cops jerked his hands upwards, injuring his wrists and his shoulders, and then tripped him face first. With his hands cuffed behind his back, he was unable to prevent serious injury to his face. The cops wrote that he was under the influence of drugs and therefore began beating his head against the window of the back seat of the police car while being transported to the station. Somehow, despite the report claiming that this fellow was under the influence, they never requested that any blood be taken, or any blow in the breathalyzer, to confirm the suspicion. They just took the guy to the hospital (due to the severe bleeding from the head), and he ordered a blood test. The test came back negative for any illegal drugs or intoxicating substances.   In other words, these lying SOBs thought nobody was going to be scrutinizing their police report. Otherwise, they would have come up with at least a marginally better story.   The mistrust is deep. But a good part of it is simple contempt for the law and the constitution on the part of a sizable minority of Chicago's finest.  2.) If there weren't so many bad cops, civil rights guys like me wouldn't be able to bring as many civil rights suits. In other words, I'd have to find a new line of work. Admittedly, this was hyperbole. Even good cops mess up every now and then, and civil rights attorneys perform an important function in keeping the police in line. But the kinds of abuses of power that go on in this city are ridiculous, and the sheer number of them are inexcusable. If the City really wanted to save money on its legal budget, it would't start by changing the practices of the department (which they have done a few times in the last decade). They'd start by cleaning up the police force."
chicago,3dyl6l,ChicagoEsq,-22,Mon Jul 20 23:02:14 2015 UTC,Ok I'm not going to address #1 because you can come up with whatever story you'd like and I have really no comment because I only deal with facts. So #2 is our only discussion and it's a good one. I've posed this question to many a person and have gotten no good responses yet. You become the commish and get to change all use of force all policy and all orders of the cpd with no interference from unions mayors or the public. What do you change?
chicago,3dyl6l,Sparty_On,15,Mon Jul 20 23:32:37 2015 UTC,"I only deal in facts. That's what lawyers do: we deal with facts.   In terms of your question about #2: Its a good question, and a fair question. The problem is that I'm a lawyer, not a police officer. So what I know is only what is within the realm of my experience.   In terms of avoiding civil liability, I think there are a number of things the City can do. The first is to empower IPRA (or an IPRA-like body) to do a full investigation of complaints, including complaints brought before courts. They know I'm not going to talk to them, or permit my clients to talk to them, when we have a case against the City pending. So why are they calling me up the moment the Complaint is filed, and not following up after the case is dismissed pursuant to settlement, or after the trial is over? The answer is because IPRA, in these instances, is not interested in disciplining officers. Its about protecting the City's bottom line.   Another thing is even more simple: in a case in which depositions are taken, IPRA should be going over these depositions to determine whether the police officers actually did violate the constitution, or the law. Why do they need to talk to my client when their attorneys talk to my client with a court reporter present to take down everything he or she says?   Another thing the City can do is actually discipline officers who violate the law. These guys are law enforcement. It should go without saying that violating the law (even for the sake of enforcing other laws) should be an anathema. Instead, the culture appears to be ""we have to make an arrest, and we'll do what we can do to do that - even if it involves trampling over the constitution."" Frankly, plaintiff's attorneys can't be the only people trying to keep the police in line. I don't see CPD attempting to do that.   Another thing - and this one is political, admittedly - stop arresting people for non-violent drug offenses. The City announced a policy of giving tickets to certain non-violent drug offenders in certain circumstances. The City's application of the policy, in the eyes of many civilians, has been ""if its a white kid from the North side (my neighborhood), give him a ticket and he'll pay $500 over on West Superior, and if he's a black kid from the South Side, arrest him and give him his day in Court.""   This adds to the sense that the police are not there to preserve order, but rather to harass minorities and people in low-income neighborhoods. I don't understand the argument that policing non-violent crime causes violent crime rates to go down. It seems to have the opposite effect, in my opinion.   Like I said, I'm not an expert in law enforcement. But I do have a perspective that comes from a certain amount of experience. I'm not (just) a Monday morning quarterback."
chicago,3dyl6l,ChicagoEsq,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:49:54 2015 UTC,Here's some ideas from my side of things. When one of your clients files a fraudulent CR they should be punished. That also rarely happens. Secondly nonviolent drug arrests can come from numerous reasons at least in my experience. Was the guy an asshole. Was the guy part of a bigger problem in the street and they thought they could flip him. I've never had an honest person that was relaxed and found weed on them that I've not given a pass on. And that's both south and westsides. And coppers have gotten fired or suspended for lying on stands and off duty shit all the time.

Studies of teacher effectiveness have found that within the same school, there can be a difference of half a grade level of learning between the classrooms of average performing teachers (50th percentile) and low performing teachers (25th percentile) in reading and math.   If you look at how reading and math level affect a student's lifetime earnings as other studies have done, you can estimate that a bad teacher reduces the present value of his or her students' collective lifetime earnings by about $400,000 compared to an average teacher. (This research was used in testimony in Vergara v. California, where the judge found that California's teacher tenure system violated students' rights.) That's $400,000 in damage every year."

chicago,3dyl6l,flatcurve,4,Mon Jul 20 20:43:44 2015 UTC,That pension has protection baked into the Illinois constitution. I would be very surprised if there was much more than minor changes to the existing structure of it.
chicago,3dyl6l,_Guinness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:42 2015 UTC,Pretty spot on.  The only way pensions will be able to be reduced would require 1) the state allowing municipal bankruptcies and 2) Chicago declaring bankruptcy.  Then the cities pension obligations can be reduced--as federal law would trump the state's constitution (as we saw in Detroit).  I don't see that happening here.

chicago,3dyl6l,chitownrp,6,Mon Jul 20 23:07:49 2015 UTC,"As two others have pointed out, yes, it would not work. But they're not just saying that. It has been attempted before. Failed miserably.   Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared.[1] 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades.[2]   This is actually one of those ""traditionally right wing"" things that I actually agree with even though I'm liberal. Because there is significant examples of how bad it went. And there is just no way to solve the outcome. The only way would be to get literally every trading point across the globe to enact it all together. And when we can't even agree to stop murdering each other, I highly doubt the entire world will agree on some stupid little tax."

chicago,3e2b0i,865to312,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"Work begins on Chicago's first 'shared street'  Construction is beginning on Chicago's first ""shared street"" project that will transform a three-block stretch of Argyle Street in Uptown into a European-style plaza boulevard where pedestrians, bicyclists and motor vehicles must learn to co-exist in one wide, curb-less lane, city officials said Monday.  The experiment, on Argyle between Broadway and Sheridan Road, is intended to help neighborhood small businesses and encourage more street life in the form of foot-powered traffic along the colorful corridor filled with Vietnamese restaurants and shops, officials said.  The $3.6 million project will raise the level of the road a few inches to be flush with the sidewalk, replace the asphalt topcoat with paving stones and eliminate the curbs to promote a ""living street"" venue inviting to sidewalk cafes and street fairs, said Chicago Transportation Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld.  Argyle will temporarily become one-way eastbound during construction, which is expected to be carried out in phases to minimize disruptions, and the project is expected to be completed next summer, according to the Chicago Department of Transportation.  Access to businesses and the CTA Red Line's Argyle station will be maintained during the work, officials said.  When two-way traffic is restored on Argyle, the idea is to promote a setting where pedestrians have priority over vehicles, officials said. Street planters will be installed to beautify the parklike atmosphere. The planters, along with pavement markings, will help to diminish whatever traffic remains on Argyle, where the speed will be restricted to 15 mph and parking spots will be limited, officials said.  Design of the shared street was led by Burns & McDonnell, an engineering and architectural firm, with help from the site design group, ltd, a Chicago-based landscape and urban design company, CDOT said. Ald. Harry Osterman, 48th, promoted the project.  jhilkevitch@tribpub.com  Twitter @jhilkevitch"

Though, to be fair, it was never a bad or grungy store it was just really small and cramped. Even back when the ""Southport Corridor"" was not yet a thing and Jewel and Osco were pretty much the only thing on that stretch it was relatively nice. Even the Music Box didn't reopen until the late 80s; Southport has changed dramatically (as you may well know).   Actually the one on Roosevelt and State is pretty nice too and has a good, quality selection. First time I walked in last year there I did not know what I'd find."

The 30 minute wait when there were 0 customers in front of me, 2 customers being rung up and 4 employees on staff wasn't scummy - annoying, but not scummy.  Then I finally get rung up. I wanted to buy a Moto G and their cheapest data plan. The owner of this particular franchise tells me there's a sale, buy 2 months and get 1 free. The following conversation ensues.  Mutandi: ""Great, I'll take the cheapest tier. They won't be using data much at all""  Scum: ""Well the deal is only good for the middle tier and higher""  Mutandi: ""No worries, I'll stick with the cheapest tier and skip the deal.""  Scum: ""Sorry, you can't sign up with the cheapest tier""   Mutandi: ""What? It doesn't say that anywhere in any of your promotions or online""  Scum: ""Yea, it's a rule, but it isn't online. After the first 2 months you can switch to the cheapest tier""  Wanting to get the phone and get the hell out of there I agreed to it.  Scum: ""We're also throwing in a free trial to our music service. The first month is free and it's $6/mo after that""  Mutandi: ""Thanks, but you can remove that. They won't be using it at all""  Scum: ""You can't remove it. You have to cancel at the end of the month or it'll charge you $6""  Mutandi: blank stare  Scum: ""Ok here's the total charges, including the activation fee of $60""  Mutandi: ""I thought Cricket doesn't charge activation fees?""  Scum: ""There's always an activation fee. Everyone does it""  Mutandi: ""I don't believe you. Let's check out Cricket's website""  I proceed to try to buy a plan online on my phone in front of this guy and got to the checkout with:   the cheapest plan selected no activation fee no BS music service   Mutandi: ""Cancel this transaction. I'm not buying from you and I'm going to tell everyone I know not to buy from you. I get it. You're the franchise owner and you're trying to get as large of an upfront charge as possible because that's where you make your money, but you're scamming people who come here to save money. We're done""  He proceeded to tell me it's always more expensive at the store than online to which I replied I'd understand if the phone itself cost more at the store. Sure, there's a premium for getting that phone immediately from the store. But that's not where the extra charges were coming from. That dude is scummier than the floors of Service Merchandise before it closed its doors forever. I can only wish the same misfortune for this asshole's franchise."

I fell in with the hiphop crowd and became a pretty good breaker and founded a crew. Ended up parlaying that into turning pro and opening a dance studio in my 20s. All because I wanted to impress chicks at parties when I was 14. Wish I was around for Limelight, Warehouse, all the original shit.

That was me in the tunnels ha...was mostly a breaker though. But got arrested at the ripe ol age of 10 for criminal damage to property for spray painting.

The Jungle Jewel at Division and Milwaukee is about a thousand times better than it had been back in the '90s. Back then, you'd see people shopping in their underwear. Although it was one of the very few grocery stores around, the neighborhood would drive a mile north to the Kennedy and Belmont just to get to the Dominick's up there. At some point, someone with common cents realized that ""wow, there are a lot of people not using food stamps that come through here"" and they slowly started to upgrade their store.

Now, given the way you're responding in this thread, I assume you don't think the answer to improving our poorly managed state is ""elect Republicans.""   And since you're at least intelligent enough to log onto the internet and form coherent sentences, we can assume you don't think the answer is ""status quo.""

Most of the problems we have are due to Republicans like George Ryan, Jim Edgar and Jim Thompson, the latter two of which ran their campaigns based on reducing taxes and then, as soon as they got elected, raised taxes.

chicago,3dztbh,john_the_fisherman,4,Tue Jul 21 03:02:56 2015 UTC,"Right, and you could equally argue that younger politicians are more easily swayed because they have less experience in their jobs and don't know how to do them, so they're more inclined to listen to the helpful people who write bills for them and donate money to them.

chicago,3dztbh,Kumdogmillionaire,4,Tue Jul 21 13:48:44 2015 UTC,Term limits are a fool's way of putting a band-aid on politics. It may fix a few things but doesn't come close to addressing the issue. If anything I think term limits would make the political situation worse (special interests dig especially deep in new elected officials. More new elected officials--> more corruption off the start).
chicago,3dztbh,nameless22,4,Tue Jul 21 00:13:01 2015 UTC,Term limits keep people like Madigan from being able to consolidate power over a long period of time

Robert Taylor homes on the South Side is also legendary.  Not only for being the basis of the 70's sitcom 'Good Times' (you know the comedy were a young, like 11 yo young, Janet Jackson got raped in the stairwell) but also for the regular shootings from the buildings towards 290.

When it did happen, city workers and contractors would come with the police. (Muhammad Ali founded a publicly funded corporation to provide residents with maintenance jobs in lieu of welfare. A stunning success, I'm sure.) But the gangs were irritated by the police presence, so they would intimidate and threaten the workers. For example (from Robert Taylor Homes),   A maintenance man at Taylor was beaten with a chain Feb. 11 by gang members after he allowed police access to a building, according to police reports.  Workers resumed installing window guards Thursday at the Chicago Housing Authority's Robert Taylor Homes, a day after police raided buildings where crews had been threatened by gangs.  CHA officials responded that their efforts to keep the buildings clean were being foiled by street gang members. They also welcomed any long-term assistance in that effort from the school board and ministers, but warned that freshly painted walls and new light bulbs in the past, have been promptly destroyed by gang members and drug dealers."

Plastic bags are still very energy-intensive, and at the end of their lifespan (which let's face it, most people probably won't reuse those bags very often and instead will just throw them away or use them for dog shit), they just get buried in landfills to decompose for 500 years."

I'm inclined to believe these guys since their videos are usually top notch and they're quick to point out their own mistakes.   https://youtu.be/g9OqQ1PaACg"
chicago,3dz9lb,gordonkristan,2,Tue Jul 21 12:04:53 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true. I wish that dude had spent less time talking about climate change and more time talking about the specific science behind ""biodegradable"" plastics (even though yes, they are connected), but otherwise that video was fine.   Biodegradable plastics aren't really ""real"" in my opinion, simply because that uncertified label usually only means that they'll break down quicker than traditional petro-plastics- meaning that they are still made of basically the same shit but maybe it will take 500 years instead of 1,000 for them to break down. When they break down, they'll still emit very harmful methane (which is another reason why composting is so important, as all your wasted food eventually does the same thing).  Truly biodegradable plastics (bio-plastics, usually made from corn or potato starch) are typically referred to as compostable, as they have to be BPI-certified to certain standards and will completely break down into natural and helpful organic matter when turned over to commercial composting facilities. This means that throwing your BPI-certified bioplastic bag in the trash just adds it to a landfill environment where it will just sit for maybe 250 years since it isn't receiving the heat/oxygen it needs to break down properly... but at least it still breaks down into something useful rather than more methane.  While true bioplastics are WORLDS better than traditional petro-plastics even if they just end up in regular municipal waste streams, Chicago needs to get off it's ass and develop a city commercial composting program so we can actually make proper use of environmentally-friendly packaging. Until then, there are several third-party commercial composting organizations that will pick up residential compost (for a fee of course).   For anyone interested: Look for the ""BPI Certified"" label or anything that mentions meeting ""ASTM D6400"" standards for composting if you're curious whether or not your packaging is eco-friendly. Also, sorry for the wall of text."

chicago,3dz9lb,jf1902,3,Mon Jul 20 20:26:48 2015 UTC,Aldis can't make any money charging 10c / bag.  The 10 cents is a token amount to get people thinking about saving and reusing their bags.   They charge a quarter deposit to use their carts and everyone makes the extra trip with the cart back to the store to get their quarter back.  I find it quite remarkable.  When you give stuff away free people abuse the system.  Look at all the shopping carts scattered about haphazardly rolling around in parking lots at stores like Target or Home Depot.  Many people don't even bother to walk a few feet and put them in the cart collection cages.

But can no longer find it. Do you have the article that references this?  I seem to remember something about dogs being put down, because they weren't being put in the system fast enough. So when people would call, they would check the system, and the database record for the dog wouldn't be entered yet. But the dog would be there.  So the dog would be entered AFTER it ran out of ""time"" so to speak and was euthanized.   ""Yeah we have your dog, we had it all along, and we killed it before we could even tell you we had it, whoops sorry"""
chicago,3dxzhu,ChicagoCyclist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"I can't find an article though I know there is a few I believe. I visited a shelter in Chicago not long ago to see if I can help walk dogs and so forth. I asked the guy who ran the place how quickly dogs can be put down if the shelter is overcrowded (which is usual), and he said it can only take a day unfortunately. Of course they euthanize the sick animals first, but the newcomers are usually next in line. Also, what you mentioned about dogs entering the shelter after its time ran out is completely true. The whole system for the Chicago animal shelter is funky."
chicago,3dxzhu,lidocaineus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"The CACC is the only city shelter. Whatever shelter you went to that said 24 hours is not a city shelter and I'm not even sure what that is, as the CACC will only place animals with fosters and no-kills that I know of."

chicago,3dxzhu,wesleyeric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"Where did you hear about the 24 hour limit? There is a mandatory 3 day hold for all animals (it used to be 5, but was unfortunately reduced to 3). After 3 days the animal is released into the adoption pavilions unless they're evaluated with medical conditions; they're not ""put down"" all of a sudden. The only time an animal is put down immediately is it's a serious and immediate danger to itself or others. This isn't for things like biting someone, this is for things like rabid animals. In addition, unless a local city rescue has special dispensation (very rare), they all pull from the population at CACC.  The CACC isn't awesome (though it is necessary and does need plenty of good leadership direction to operate properly) and I do recommend putting off dropping an animal there off if you can help find it's owners yourself, but please don't spread around negative falsehoods about it; it's not a death sentence when you go there. Volunteers there are pretty much saints, and they always need more.   Oh and regarding finding the owners yourself, please be extremely careful. I'd recommend never posting photos of a dog you have in your possession as there are many unscrupulous people who look for certain types of dogs, then  pretend to be owners and end up subjecting these dogs to horrible things."

I opted for the free, ""two hour"" delivery option which really was a window of two to four hours from the time I ordered.  The app tells you when the driver leaves with your order and you can track them heading towards you, much like the lyft app.  I'd definitely do it again, saves a trip to the grocery store when you're feeling lazy.  Although they don't carry produce or anything frozen.  Hopefully they'll expand to more of an Amazon Fresh service in the future."

chicago,3dy6nv,HalKitzmiller,4,Mon Jul 20 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"Tip is included in the charge (think its $5). I ordered some computer hardware this weekend and did the free delivery as well, got it quickly and promptly."
chicago,3dy6nv,thegreattonge,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the tip is built into the prices for products, or is it a separate line item when you check out?"
chicago,3dy6nv,HalKitzmiller,7,Mon Jul 20 16:07:38 2015 UTC,"We did it on Saturday. When you get to the part where you review the order, it puts a $5 tip on as well, but you can change it to whatever you feel comfortable with. Also, you can change it up to 48 hours after the order."

chicago,3dy6nv,thegreattonge,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is...the delivery is not free.  Maybe they call it a tip, but it is essentially a delivery fee.  I don't ""tip"" my UPS driver when he brings my prime orders.   Can you set it to zero?  Does the driver know what you are tipping (and could therefore give you better or worse service accordingly?).  If not, it is just a lie so they can say it is ""free"".  I just don't think anyone working for amazon should be tipped.  They are a giant company, not a struggling restaurant.  They should be able to pay their drivers fair wages and benefits just like Fedex, UPS, and USPS do."
chicago,3dy6nv,ottothecow,8,Mon Jul 20 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"Hey I am just reporting on the user experience, I am not the policy maker. Also ""free"" and a min tip of $5 in my eyes is the same amount of $ I would spend on a bus/train ride back and forth to pick up whatever the item would be."
chicago,3dy6nv,thegreattonge,3,Mon Jul 20 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The fact that there is an option for a tip in the first place suggests they're not paying their drivers enough to cover their costs. So basically that $5 is the delivery fee, but you have the option to screw over the driver and pay nothing."
chicago,3dy6nv,CptnComic,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:16 2015 UTC,"Oh god, do you realize how ridiculous you sound?  First of all, UPS/Fedex ships across multiple days.  Also, they don't deliver it to you in person (if you do the good old 8-5) and don't give you a heads up the moment they will deliver it. They will leave it in your mailroom or front door. Amazon does it with a direct person picking your stuff up then taking it to you. You can track them so you can pick it up and make sure it's all good. And you can order it and ship it at a wider range of time, instead of having to be at home at 11 am if you want to pick it up the moment it arrives."
chicago,3dy6nv,HiHorror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am the ridiculous one for thinking that ""free"" shipping that comes with a service I pay $100 a year for (in addition to the price of the products) shouldn't have an almost mandatory tip fee associated with it, that they don't even mention until you get to checkout.  Can you even set it to zero?  A Forbes article I just read said that you couldn't.  I don't tip my uber driver.  I don't tip the courier service (bike or van) that delivers time sensitive packages to my office.  Amazon can pay these guys full wages and benefits...don't ask me to pick up the slack on a premium service I already pay extra for (and that they recently raised the price $20 on)."
chicago,3dy6nv,ottothecow,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can set it to $0.  I suppose if you really don't want to be concerned with any service issues due to a poor tip, you could set the tip to $5, and then after you receive the items you could go in and change the tip to $0 (you have 48 hours)."

Many Amazon ""shipped and sold"" items are no longer available for two day.

What good is a product I want for the weekend if it doesn't make its friday delivery date?  And ordering things on the weekend sucks.  Amazon has people working 7 days a week, as do USPS (Just not for retail customers/deliveries), Fedex, and UPS.  Why do things that get ordered on sunday (or even later saturday afternoon) take until Wednesday to arrive?  I'm sitting on an order now and amazon's own tracking now says it won't even be here until Thursday.  That's not 2-day, even if you restrict it to business days."

chicago,3dyic5,R_TOKAR,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:46 2015 UTC,"After scouring the lease agreement, only an address and email address were provided for the landlord - no phone.   I haven't tried calling the agent since then, but will do so."
chicago,3dyic5,deadmandrawing,6,Mon Jul 20 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Start with the agent, and have them give you a phone number to the landlord/PM. Any reputable agent will give you that info."

chicago,3dyic5,Skypiglet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:13 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree with you. Still very unnerving that they have an email address specifically for maintenance issues and nobody responds. Good thing about email is that it is documented.

You never know what else might be missing/broken if they don't even respond to something as simple as the missing detector.  Also, I believe you could have reported it to the local fire department and the landlord can get fined."
chicago,3dyic5,deadmandrawing,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"While not a bad idea in general, this probably will invite retaliation and other repercussions from the landlord. It's not right, but it probably will happen."

Has anybody called this in via 311 and had any experience with the inspector (is anyone/ knows someone that is an inspector)?
chicago,3dyic5,the_koob,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:16 2015 UTC,"I have. Depending on how severe the issues are, you can get an inspector to come out pretty quickly. The apartment I lived in at the time had a pretty bad cockroach infestation (right in Gold Coast). Inspector came out the next day and issue was fixed pretty quickly after (I know you can't ever fix cockroaches). Super nice guy, very understanding.  You can also submit a complaint online."

I have a ton of keys in a draw that belong to various friends and neighbors. When they first gave me their key, I put a tag on the key chain with their address. Why did I do that? At the time, I thought it was smart in the event that I died and some member of my family had to go through my possessions and try to return all these keys. I live alone and most likely my heirs have no idea who the people are.    In hindsight, this was dumb and I should come up with a different way to label keys.

chicago,3dyxst,RowOrWade,3,Mon Jul 20 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't what you want to hear, but I feel obligated:  Be extremely careful entering abandoned buildings, especially places like industrial facilities, hospitals, and universities/high schools. Part of my job is doing initial entry and assessment of abandoned facilities, and I regularly encounter dangerous situations.  I see people have discussed the obvious dangers (i.e. humans), but these abandoned facilities occasionally have dangerous chemicals in them. These can cause toxic fumes, extreme risk of explosion/fire (i.e. light sensitive or shock sensitive chemicals), and generally toxic materials.  If you're going to go, avoid industrial facilities, have at least one person know where you're going, get out if you feel strange or light-headed at all, and either wear boot covers or clean your shoes before entering your home. Also try not to eat or drink in these facilities.  I know it comes across as a buzzkill, but I've found myself in some dangerous situations, where luckily my training in hazardous materials has prevented me from making huge mistakes that others may not avoid. If you go, be safe, and good luck."

I wish I had more info for you but that's the best I can do. I'm curious at some cool spots too, I want to check them out.   When I was a kid in the 80s we'd sneak into the abandoned Tuberculosis Sanitarium hositals and buildings in the back of Peterson Pk (The whole park used to be a sanitarium) and it was creepy as fuck. Thousands of chest x-ray photos just scattered everywhere, old timey equipment, hospital shit just littered everywhere, it looked like they just left over night and didn't bother to pack up anything or whatever. It was definitely the closest I've ever been to being in a horror movie. It's all condo's back there now, but some of the structures still exist (bell/guard tower, the guard house on Peterson and Central Pk. If you ever just wander around the whole pk including the back, you may be able to gain access to some of the still existing buildings."

People are so drunk and the boats get so slippery I thought at any second a neck was going to break or it was man overboard and sunk No one swam (okay, pee), but I got in a big floatie to go explore the open water because the people I went with were insufferable.

And if you submit everything, and keep copies, it shouldn't go up. I actually submitted a contestation that got lost in the mail. I watched it online for months before it was marked as overdue. This meant I had to go contest it in person but after clearly stating that I'd done my due diligence and showed them every dated item, they dropped the whole thing.

(Wish I'd have done that off the bat).  And if you haven't gone yet - just a heads up, if they decide it classifies as ""contesting"" your ticket, they'll have you go to a judge.

chicago,3dujh7,NotARealAtty,5,Mon Jul 20 09:06:07 2015 UTC,"This is a good question.  The reality of so many in poverty (both rural or urban) is that your only support structure seems to be  near you. This can be family, friends, or just acquaintance - networking is important to finding jobs - ask any post graduate job seeker. Once you leave an area, your support structure is vastly diminished and if you are really poor -this hits you even harder. Examples can  be loss of emergency child care, not having that ride to work if you break down (transportation), borrowing money when in a bind because your electricity is shut off, loss of the little side jobs you do under the table... These seem like small things but losing the help from your support structure- that can break you.  I know this first hand, as I moved many states away from the south side of chicago. It was, by far, the hardest thing I've done (and I recently finished up grad school) I am just one individual though.   If all these individual poor folks start moving en mass for jobs- well you see what happens to areas such as Italy, Germany or parts of the United States. There is a huge pushback from the communitys they move too. The problem is that there are not enouth jobs regardless of how people shift around.  Emigration for jobs is the #1 reason people move, and the first to leave an area are those with means. This causes a feedback loop that makes it even harder for those that stay (loss of jobs as job makers leave, education system goes to shit because loss of tax dolars, public transportation bucks cut, etc).   All in all, these factors take a much harder toll economically for those without and that make it really fucking hard to move.   Edit: to your last point- low cost of living typically are in areas with very few job prospects. The rural area I moved to (for example) has really sweet rent prices... but work was for minimum wage or just slightly above."

chicago,3dujh7,FIRESTRIK3,9,Sun Jul 19 22:29:18 2015 UTC,"By that reasoning, the US could have the most draconian laws in history and you would still say ""don't do the crime.."""
chicago,3dujh7,daimposter,0,Sun Jul 19 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"yes.  i would agree with you.  the laws are the result of the voters voting their legislators into office and voicing their opinions to them while in office, and voting them out or keeping them in office in keeping with the demands of their representative populace.  this becomes a reflection of the morality of the overall voting population.  you don't like it, vote, protest, write, exercise your rights.  but in the meantime, don't be upset if you or someone you know or love violates the law and is prosecuted for it.  pretty simple."
chicago,3dujh7,vse0,2,Mon Jul 20 04:16:43 2015 UTC,"so what happens when I write to my congresscritter and just get a canned auto-reply back about the issue I was addressing? do I just twiddle my thumbs until I donate enough money to be worth listening to? I agree that it's important to speak up if you want change, so I'm totally with you on that, but acting like the system of lawmaking is ""pretty simple"" is to mistake the theoretical way our politicians should behave with the actual ways that things get changed. things are always changing, and sometimes it takes a while for legislature to catch up with the will of the people. one can be working for change for a minute before actually seeing the change take effect."

chicago,3dz952,mutandi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:50 2015 UTC,I used to go to the LAF on Randolph in 2013/2014. It's not that bad at all. It was much nicer than any other LAF I went to which were really dumps.   Changing jobs made that location inconvenient and the other LAFs I've been to really are dumps. When I was looking for other gyms I checked out the Wicker Park and Bucktown locations of the Chicago Athletic Clubs and they had much fewer free weight stuff than the LAF on Randolph.   Wear flip flops in the shower and you'll be fine. You're there (presumably) to lift heavy things and put them down. It does the job and it's pretty cheap.

chicago,3dw1st,jojofine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:14 2015 UTC,"Do you live in Evanston currently? Evanston is a great location will be great, in terms of commute. I am also considering Northwestern for grad school...so that would work out wonderfully. I'm a tad worried about the ""suburban lyfe"" and going to dad bars (I'm a wee 20-something). Any thoughts?"
chicago,3dw1st,prior2two,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"The only ""dad bars"" up there are on the way western side of town away from Northwestern.  There are a few downtown but you're usually able to tell without even going inside what kind of clientele the place is going for.  The city overall seems relatively young.  Definitely a strong stoller brigade up there but no worse than Southport of Lincoln Square."
chicago,3dw1st,Bakkie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:41 2015 UTC,"If you go to Evanston, you will either need to commute to the city, or make friends in Evanston. Friends in the city will not want to travel to Evanston.   It's not a terrible commute, but it is a semi chore to get to from the city if you already live on the city."
chicago,3dw1st,jojofine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:50 2015 UTC,"I live near Evanston, grew up there, hang out with people  there.  Evanston used to be dry. When they first  allowed liquor, the city council required that food be the primary product and liquor secondary . Initially you had to order food to get a drink and there were like 4 package goods stores in town.   It has  gotten more liberal but  you don't find a lot of plain  tavern/bars like Wrigleyville.  The NU kids don't seem to be bothered though.  If you are considering grad school, is it one  at the Evanston Campus or the downtown campus?  If you are looking there and need to be close to the EL or Metra, be aware that the strip between Howard St and the Yellow line/Skokie Swift tracks  has some security problems. Stay north of the Swift tracks and you'll be okay.  There are also parts of Rogers Park near the Morse, Loyola, Granville and Thorndale stops which are okay. The news report of shootings seem to center around Ashland up there. I personally would not feel safe  later at night near the Jarvis top, but its patchy. Srtay away from the Rogers/Howard, north of Howard area. Too many reports of unsafe stuff. Just follow the  news reports to get a sense of things."
chicago,3dw1st,jojofine,18,Tue Jul 21 01:42:43 2015 UTC,"Andersonville, Lincoln Square or certain parts of Evanston would all be up your alley"
chicago,3dw1st,ChiraqBluline,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:54 2015 UTC,May I ask if you've lived in Evanston? How's the area just north of Rogers Park? This may actually be most convenient in terms of commute for me (to Northbrook) but I'm hoping to avoid living with dads!
chicago,3dw1st,barimann,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"I live in Rogers Park closer to Morse.  Its a nice area and half the people who live around me seem to work in some capacity for Northwestern or Loyola.  For dining, entertainment and whatnot we usually head up to Evanston or Andersonville though.  Both are easy to get to and Evanston has cheap/abundant parking if you decide to drive up there instead of taking the train.  Within a few years I'll probably move to Evanston when I get sick of my condo and want to get into a SF house.  The southern end of Evanston is hit or miss.  Obviously it gets much nicer the further north from Howard you get.  Along the lake isn't too bad but it can be very expensive depending on what kind of building you want to be in.    edit - Another thing to note is that with the exception of South Blvd, all of the purple line stops have a decent assortment of dining and shops around them.  At Central you need to go west a bit closer towards the stadium but overall each one has a pretty solid place to eat and usually a solid bar around it which is really nice."
chicago,3dw1st,AndSolskjaerHasWonIt,5,Mon Jul 20 18:11:08 2015 UTC,"Ravenswood, Lincoln Square, and Albany park. And maybe even the part of Rogers park that surrounds Loyola"

First the property costs were a little lower, that may not still be the case.  Second the ""downtown"" area is larger than Lincoln Square and there seems to be a lot going on.

chicago,3dw1st,froyololol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:42:43 2015 UTC,"There is no real central ""hub"" in Ravenswood, but you do have the area of Lincoln Square around Western and Lawrence (the shopping/bar area specifically) and Montrose between Western and Ravenswood. Both of these areas have bars and shops which are unique and fun.  With Ravenswood, it's more spread out rather than being all in one place. It doesn't take a long time to get between these two areas, though - maybe 5 to 10 minutes. If you want to go a bit more north, you can also explore around the Damen Brown Line stop. There's also plenty to do over there!"

chicago,3dw1st,yinkadoubledare,11,Mon Jul 20 03:33:55 2015 UTC,Ravenswood is pretty affordable in comparison to most of the North side. Lincoln square area is probably more interesting but housing is probably about the same.
chicago,3dw1st,Greensauce,4,Mon Jul 20 03:35:45 2015 UTC,West Town and Ukranian Village are nice.  Lots of good stuff to eat on Chicago Ave.

chicago,3dw1st,nawinter77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:27:53 2015 UTC,I grew up in Northbrook and your commute could be pretty easy depending on how close you live to a MN-W train and how close your office is to the NBK train station. The drive from Evanston is very easy and you shouldn't run into any bad outbound traffic during rush hour. (Relatively speaking of course)
chicago,3dw1st,nawinter77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:48 2015 UTC,Roscoe/Lakeview. It has a lot of younger families but good restaurants and bars all around.

chicago,3dznqw,pfeff,0,Mon Jul 20 20:52:33 2015 UTC,"I am curious to know what others here think of these two venues for a bachelor party venue. I like both these places but just in a different context. For me, I'd save the Signature room for a different occasion like celebrating a promotion, graduation, engagement, etc.  The boat idea is only good if it's a booze cruise style boat. But, I'm not familiar with those in Chicago. I once went on a Navy Pier fireworks boat cruise and found it to be incredibly boring. But, it had the potential to be romantic. Hence, why I wonder you'd chose it for a bachelor party.   If you want to do a boat thing I would schedule it during the day. The location to anchor is called the PlayPen at Oak St beach, I believe.  Do you have a mixture of young and old guests? If so, I guess then these make sense. But, if the group is young, say 20-something, then how come you're not going somewhere that's more of a ""bachelor party"" scene? The bars in Wrigleyville seem like a pretty standard destination. Or, the Viagra triangle and bars on Division/State.  There's a smattering of bars that have bowling lanes, too around Chicago."

chicago,3dv1y2,negativepressure,9,Sun Jul 19 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I work there!  Tips:    Buy your Total Experience Pass online in advance here Print out your tickets and go to the information desk (bypass the main line) The 5 o'clock aquatic show will be a trainer show most likely and the other times are ""One world"" if you plan to be there all day I recommend the trainer show (they're both great no matter what) Study the map in advance, the aquarium is old so it has a lot of addon's that makes it confusing on maps (Ex. Wild Reef) Parking, Shedd & Field share the same parking lot but I hear the parking lot by Adler is a few dollars cheaper. When it comes to your 4D experience, choose the Sea Monsters, if you have kids it's an alright film for them but it's more for teens+. Spongebob 4D is the better experience for children. Show up to your Aquatic Show 30 minutes prior. They open curtains 30 minutes prior so you'd get first pick at seats. Go to Stingray Touch while there is an aquatic show happening. There will be a lot less people and will let you spend as much time as you want with the rays. Watch out for black birds with a small red stripe. They protect their nests and will attack you (it's not that bad) if you are walking along a path that has a nest near it. Have fun :)"

They're $54 for adult and $45 for kids.

The biggest reason to pre purchase, is that you are able to skip the main line, which can take up to an hour, and go straight to will call inside the building.    For hotels, take a look at ones in the Rodgers Park neighborhood, they are about 20 minutes away from the aquarium, but very close to Lake shore drive, the easiest way to get there.    Have fun!"

If he's planning on being down there at open, which is 9am, it is totally possible that it could take from 15 to 30 minutes (for me it's usually 20) to get there driving on the weekend.  For me, weekdays is 30 to 45 minutes.  Depending on the lot he parks in, it could take up to another 10 minutes to walk to the front door.  There is a close surface lot adjacent to the Field museum that is about a 2 minute walk, and one farther down by Adler."

In general, the hotels off the interstates are the best value and you can get downtown in under 30 minutes.  I usually reccommend the hotels around I-55 and Rt 83, for example:  La Quinta Inn Chicago Willowbrook 855 79th St Willowbrook, IL 60527  If you look on google maps you will see similar priced hotels very close.  It's a safe location and there are tons of cheap restaurants and shopping."

Keep in mind those locations will ad 45 min to 1hr additional travel time from STL and also the same going back into downtown.  Assuming you're coming up on I55, there are lots of hotels along I55 between I80 and I294 that will be very convienient for you.  I'd avoid going up north unless you have specific plans to see that part of the city."

chicago,3dt7vm,funkyfresh2,32,Sun Jul 19 05:57:23 2015 UTC,It was definitely the right Uber car. The woman said my name as I approached the car.  As for the taxi. Why have two properly working credit card readers. His methods were just shady.
chicago,3dt7vm,alexfrancisburchard,55,Sun Jul 19 13:20:40 2015 UTC,They use square so that they can short the taxi company.
chicago,3dt7vm,Nick4753,21,Sun Jul 19 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"The taxi companies offer horrible rates to the drivers too.  I can never understand why taxi drivers themselves care about uber. The people uber are really hurting are the medallion owners and taxi companies, both of whom do everything in their power to take as much money from the drivers as possible."
chicago,3dt7vm,d3adbor3d2,3,Sun Jul 19 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"some cabbies work for themselves. so they shoulder the operating costs, licenses, etc. which from what i understand, uber circumvents (the license/permit part).   i get why uber is so popular, it uses tech and offers drivers extra income. but to me that's like running a food truck with no food license. it's a high-tech lemonade stand. if the state/city is going to let uber operate, they might as well forego those fees they charge cab companies to even the playing field (which, they won't, because money) or charge uber drivers something similar."
chicago,3dt7vm,absentmindedjwc,4,Sun Jul 19 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the medallion owners/taxi companies were the ones to fight tooth and nail for those regulations to strong-arm out competition.  IMHO, they brought this shit on themselves."
chicago,3dt7vm,d3adbor3d2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"Well if you're a cabbie and paid 5-6 figures for a medallion to operate, of course youre going to want the same for anyone who wants to give the service that you do. Will the city refund those fees now since rideshares diminish the value of these medallions? I doubt it. Again, why should rideshares have that unfair advantage over cabs?"
chicago,3dt7vm,absentmindedjwc,3,Mon Jul 20 06:05:59 2015 UTC,You misunderstood my points.  The taxi companies were the ones championing the medallion program in the first place.
chicago,3dt7vm,d3adbor3d2,0,Mon Jul 20 12:11:55 2015 UTC,I dont get it either. The medallion program pre-dates ridesharing. That's what you need to operate a cab in chicago. To me it sounds logical that they ask the city to impose the same regulations to people who do the same service.
chicago,3dt7vm,absentmindedjwc,3,Mon Jul 20 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"The medallion program was put in place for the sole purpose of destroying competition.  Asking ride-sharing companies is all fine and good until you realize that it is literally impossible, as there is a hard limit on the number of medallions out there.  It is like saying ""you need a permit to build your business here"" while denying all new permits."
chicago,3dt7vm,deadmandrawing,3,Mon Jul 20 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"The cost of a medallion was artificially inflated due to their scarcity. They are sold off from owner to owner via auction. That a cab owner insisted on paying full price for a vastly cost-inflated item is their own fault.  Is a homeowner who paid $500K for a shitty house in a hot market owed anything once the market drops and the home's value goes to shit?  The market has changed. Maintaining the status quo to protect the bad investments of a group of shady individuals is not a good idea, at best."
chicago,3dt7vm,d3adbor3d2,0,Mon Jul 20 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"I get that but in a broader view, when GM failed and the housing market crashed guess who came running to rescue these private entities? While regular people lost homes and decimated the market. Same thing happened when companies decided that manufacturing is way cheaper if it's done overseas. What happened to the working class here? Its practically gone. It looks good on the surface because it's cheaper but now we practically dont have a middle class anymore.   You speak of ridesharing as if it's so much better. The fact that these glorified pizza delivery people are sacrificing their vehicles for what roughly amounts to $9/hr is nothing but a race to the bottom. They're thriving now because theyre an alternative to cabs. Once the taxi industry disappears as it will in the near future if nothing changes, and they themselves turn into ridesharing cars, they'll collapse on their own weight because the market will be so saturated. While quasi-dispatchers like uber will be swimming in money."
chicago,3dt7vm,deadmandrawing,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, it's dead money at this point to anyone who is doing it. That I agree with. It's a lot of work, suffering, wear and tear for far too little. But that's the case for cab drivers as well. On aggregate, there's little difference. That said, taking a rideshare home is cheaper, easier and causes far less hassle than taking a cab. If the cab companies and the City can change that for the better (instead of their current tactic of dragging the rideshares down to preserve the current system), they'll survive.  But that said, investing in a medallion entitles the investor to nothing. Every investment is a risk with no guarantees and this is no exception.  The issue of the disappearing middle class is one well beyond the scope of this issue, and preserving a broken system isn't going to do jack shit for addressing let alone fixing that."
chicago,3dt7vm,funk_your_face,23,Mon Jul 20 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Square would put the money straight into his account, while the car's machine would presumably take longer to transfer. Might have a better rate via Square also."
chicago,3dt7vm,LazarusNW,3,Sun Jul 19 14:26:41 2015 UTC,One time I was picked up by a car and driver that didn't match.  The woman said she was using her sister's account.

chicago,3dt7vm,BDB_JCD,5,Sun Jul 19 21:15:11 2015 UTC,Sounds like the 'passenger' was another uber driver and they were doubled up to try and grab more rides using two accounts and one car.  Probably splitting the gas and other expenses.  But the cabbie using 'square' instead of the in car reader is something you will see in a lot of cities.    I wouldn't stress about it unless he/she swipes the card in two different machines.
chicago,3dt7vm,snark42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"They usually lease the cab from someone.  The fees charged by that someone and the up to 60 days it can take to get paid make Square a much better alternative for the driver.  It has nothing to do with shorting the cab company (they pay by the hour, and there's a meter for a reason.)"
chicago,3dt7vm,w_t_s,41,Mon Jul 20 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"It may be illegal, but it's generally harmless.  Square just provides them better terms from my understanding.  And you can get a conveniently emailed receipt, which is nice.  The UberX thing was creepy though."
chicago,3dt7vm,ArbitrageurD,20,Sun Jul 19 10:17:08 2015 UTC,"Square is fine, but the problem with square is you don't know whether the reader is legit square or not. It's just a sketchy looking device sticking out of an iPhone and the dude swipes your card, it could easily be a counterfeit square designed to steal your info."
chicago,3dt7vm,galacticdancer,6,Sun Jul 19 19:09:00 2015 UTC,Square is awesome. I prefer them swiping on their personal machines that email your receipt because I lose those small receipts constantly.

chicago,3dt7vm,marsofwar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:28:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I think thats what it is. Thats why a lot of taxi drivers just flat out refuse to take you if you dont have cash. I've had a cab driver tell me to just get out without paying cause i was using credit card. I felt bad so I gave him whatever cash I had left which was still short. I guess they dont want to report it at all.
chicago,3dt7vm,NotTurkWendell,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:25 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The fees they get charged by the cab companies and hoops they have to jump through to get paid when you use the built in readers are absurd.

chicago,3dt7vm,moxfulder1,3,Mon Jul 20 13:09:38 2015 UTC,"I moved to Chicago and find that drivers frequently want to use Square.  It doesn't bother me.  If you use credit cards a lot, your number is going to get stolen every now and then.  This can happen when your bank gets hacked, when an online merchant where you bought something from gets hacked, when a brick-and-mortar  where you bought something gets hacked and so on.  Just check your monthly statements and call them for a new card when something goes wrong."

When the ACLU dedicates a statement on their blog directly at Über's issues, you probably should make some careful decisions.  Edit: seriously, all these downvotes? Not to be a conspiracy shill, but either Über has a protective social media division or people really do blindly love them,despite all the other points supporting me in this thread. I weirdly think it's the former, as most negative Über posts get downvoted to hell in various subs.

It has its own parking lot and is set up to facilitate greeting arrivals on the ground floor after the passenger has cleared Customs and Immigration.  Park your car and  go inside on the ground floor.  Right in front of you are two exit doors from Customs.  A and B.   The door servicing your wife's flight is shown on overhead TV monitors.  There are also closed circuit TV cameras showing people as they approach the doors so you have plenty of time to get ready at the correct door.  You may be one of many greeting people with balloons.

Stay in the right lane and pay attention to the signs for the international terminal.  There is a surface lot and often times you can park pretty close to the terminal. You walk over a bridge and go downstairs. There will be tons of people waiting to greet friends and family.  You normally don't need to get there until a bit after the person lands - since it takes awhile to clear customs, get luggage, etc. Well, check on the arrival time - international flights can get in quit a bit earlier than originally scheduled."

It's a lot of yoga, pilates, barre and HIIT classes, but there are some dance studios, boxing, martial arts, etc. My favorite studios (so far) are Go Row and Crosstown Fitness.   Additionally, I'm a big fan of taking burlesque classes. Vaudezilla is great for literally anyone interested in it, Studio L'amour is good too but women only.   Hubbard Street offers tons of dance classes.   I have yet to try it out for myself, but I'm very intrigued by the November Project.   Additionally, trapeze is a great workout but expense (check Groupon/Living Social). The TSNY currently has their outdoor trapeze set up near Belmont Harbor. Air Aerial Fitness is another similar option that is more workout than aerial arts.   Get a Divvy bike membership and Divvy everywhere."
chicago,3dug36,not_margaret,2,Mon Jul 20 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"Combat sports are an amazing way to get in the best shape of your life (without thinking about it) and having the time of your life. You're not going to start sparring and get hurt, I promise. These are great places to start and be safe:  Muay Thai (~kickboxing) Conviction Fitness in Irving Park has a solid program. Both men and women in classes training alongside people there for fitness and actual fighters. Instructors are solid kickboxing competitors so you're not learning tae-Bo nonsense. Women seem to really get into it because you'll learn how to dismantle someone (even men!) while toning your shoulders, core, legs, and ass. Everyone is a sweetheart and there to help and have fun. Trained there for a while and they put out solid fighters. (That's good because just being around someone working that hard is inspirational even if you don't want to fight)  Boxing: friends have said Reach Fieldhouse was really great. Even as a novice they enjoyed their class and instructors and also is a fight-gym so you'll have boxing pedigree instructors. Again, no xsport ""boxing"" bullshit. Both men and women usually take up boxing because it's honestly fun to hit shit. And it'll put you into terrific shape. If money is an issue chicago park district has extremely cheap programs and generates a lot of golden gloves champions. I trained at Hamlin Park for a while.   Jiu-jitsu: I've been to a few gyms and they were great but I'll recommend what I stuck with and that's Carlson Gracie schools. Most men and women aren't into rolling around with a sweaty stranger and trying to choke them unconscious. If you're curious hit a Gracie school, Rio, and Vianna Brothers. All produced solid competition winners including yours truuuuuuuuly (thank you Andre Madiz ;).   Judo: so you've decided you're a crazy person who wants to throw another human into the ground so hard it breaks their entire body. Enter Judo which is also the most popular sport in the world. The Japanese Cultural Center is my only experience and my last. Judo players are the baddest motherfuckers on the planet physically and mentally. After 6 years of combat sports I was completely broken physically and humiliated....by women. As soon as I grabbed their gi these little princesses had me launched over this hips....airborne....and being smashed onto my back with tremendous noise. It was terrifying. They were all super sweet people and really excited to teach me, it was just the hardest thing I'd ever done physically and the technique was overwhelming. That was just a level I couldn't attain.     edit: Here's my favorite Judo summary video that demonstrates what it is for those unfamiliar. You could be a 110lb girl trained in Judo and you'll be the most dangerous person in the room no matter how big or strong anyone is...men or women. No doubt.  Rhonda Rousey took down 5 men by herself in a movie theater with Judo... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5MhxPwU1Q8     That said - they were all fun as hell. Gets you in amazing shape, you meet people who are positive influences in life, and it calms you emotionally. Couldn't recommend it enough."

chicago,3dutby,Vgzone,17,Sun Jul 19 18:10:29 2015 UTC,UIUC down in Champaign is by far the best in the state for CS.  It is ranked #5 in the country by US News.  Northwestern would be second best.
chicago,3dutby,mandrsn1,-10,Sun Jul 19 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"Those rankings are often based on the graduate programs. Northwestern's undergraduate CS program is fantastic, and likely more rigorous than that of UIUC."
chicago,3dutby,Lambtosh,5,Sun Jul 19 18:49:01 2015 UTC,No way. Uiuc's undergrad CS is far more competitive than NUs. Though NUs is still good.  Save on cash and go to a better CS program by going to UIUC.
chicago,3dutby,ZeOppositeOfProgress,7,Mon Jul 20 12:45:39 2015 UTC,"likely more rigorous than that of UIUC   Based on what?    I'm not saying Northwestern is bad, it isn't, but it doesn't have anywhere near as good of a name around the country as UIUC."
chicago,3dutby,mandrsn1,5,Sun Jul 19 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"Try Illinois Institute of Technology. I go there and am a CS major. The CS professors are great for the most part, and companies recruit from IIT regularly."
chicago,3dutby,Henessey1993,10,Mon Jul 20 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"I went to UIUC a few years ago and I can honestly say it was the best decision of my life. I work in tech now in Chicago and I can promise you that the CS program there is top notch. Not only that, the culture/atmosphere of living on campus is great. It's seriously not at all what one would expect from being in the middle of the state. If you have the credentials to get accepted into the CS program, I highly highly recommend attending. PM me if you have any specific questions."
chicago,3dutby,amoninu5,-12,Sun Jul 19 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"A bunch of douchey, pompous, nerds go there. Just go to the starter league, it's like trades school for CS. Cheaper, get just as good of a job, learn just as much."
chicago,3dutby,hi_illini,5,Mon Jul 20 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"While these programming training bootcamps will get your foot in the door to a good company, 5 years down the line most companies will prefer folks with CS degrees over folks with a 15 week bootcamp"
chicago,3dutby,ZeOppositeOfProgress,4,Mon Jul 20 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"What are your qualifications? It's easier to recommend schools if we know. If you can brush off the University of Illinois like that, you must have excellent credentials."
chicago,3dutby,TibetanLesbian,5,Sun Jul 19 23:07:53 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have a bias, but if you're looking into a computer science degree, you absolutely should consider University of Illinois.   I graduated in December 14 and while I didn't major in CS, a lot of my friends did. The program is top notch and will prepare you for a great job right out of school.   It's also only a 2.5 hour Amtrak ride away from Chicago. The sister cities of Urbana-Champaign are also great and each has a different vibe. Champaign especially is up and coming. You have the immediate campus town where most undergrads hang out, then there's also the downtown scene for the older crowd and locals. Don't let the surrounding corn fields fool you.   If you're looking for a degree from a top CS program and the college experience you can't go wrong with Illinois."
chicago,3dutby,eprada,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"I got my degree from Loyola Chicago, though I don't recommend doing it. The school is still very small that the course work, and resources, are limited."
chicago,3dutby,ctrl_alt_meow,2,Mon Jul 20 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"I got a BS of CS degree from DePaul. The result was expensive and mediocre. DePaul's liberal arts courses are pretty much easy As all around, so don't expect anything too challenging. Their CS classes outside of the gamedev program are a mixed bag, with a handful of excellent ones, and many awful ones. The three lowpoints of my CS career were a 300-level e-commerce  class that i attended 3 times and still aced, an internship class that cost me $2000 during which we learned LITERALLY nothing and did almost nothing, and my senior capstone class which was taught by a woman who knows nothing about programming - our final capstone project was to make a webpage using a content management system. To reiterate, my computer science capstone was done using HTML, no programming required.   The main perk of DePaul is that it somehow has a good reputation, so getting an internship will be easy. If you put in a lot of hard work at DePaul and don't do the bare minimum required to get an A, you should do alright.   One final note - i once interviewed a DePaul graduate who had a Master's of Computer science. I asked him to write me a program that would print the numbers 1-10 and he failed. This would be like an English major who didn't know all the letters of the alphabet."
chicago,3dutby,thelapoubelle,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"I was looking at Urbana-Champaign but it seems awfully far out there.    So you have a 4.0 college GPA already and an established body of CS work and coursework? If not, you don't even have a shot at transferring in. (for undergraduate)  NW and UC may work out. But Your realistic options for staying in state are going to be: UIC, DePaul, IIT, or Loyola. All of which have solid CS programs.  But you are correct, Champaign is not exactly close to Chicago."
chicago,3dutby,zootam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:49:57 2015 UTC,"My problem would be calling the college and figuring out which test they would need to accept me, such as the SAT or ACT, or the computer science equivalent of a GMAT.  I haven't been in college in 10 years, when I got my first Bachelors degree.  What made you think I would be transferring in?"
chicago,3dutby,zootam,3,Mon Jul 20 11:53:33 2015 UTC,"you didn't specify its been 10 years.  are you going to do a master's or another bachelor's?  i think most schools will be cool with an old ACT/SAT but unless you have a 36 ACT or 2400 don't expect to go to Champaign, UC, or NU. ( for undergrad, and I guess UIUC is more competitive than UC and NU)  If the school doesn't accept those scores, you will need to take some courses at some community college or somewhere to build up a GPA and apply to transfer in."
chicago,3dutby,PewPewPenguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"Why do you think you need a 4.0 GPA or a 36 or a 2400 to go to UC or NU? I got into both schools, and I did not have any of the above...  Also, I tend to find that Masters admissions are less stringent that undergrad."
chicago,3dutby,zootam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"my post was more about UIUC, which i guess is more competitive than UC and NU (for undergrad)  the requirements for UC and NU are still very high anyway"

chicago,3dutby,PewPewPenguin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:11 2015 UTC,Cool. I'm speaking from curiosity's perspective now: Is UIUC really more competitive than uChicago and Northwestern for undergrad? Or do you just mean for computer science? I was never under the impression that UIUC was competitive with either UC or NU...
chicago,3dutby,zootam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:04 2015 UTC,"Is UIUC really more competitive than uChicago and Northwestern for undergrad? Or do you just mean for computer science?   Specifically for CS, not for the other departments or as a whole. And i'm simply talking about requirements for admission.  and thats been a pretty recent change, starting around 2012 due to a huge increase in demand. you can hear it straight from the associate department head, Jeff Erickson in this post  and this post  just looked up Uchicago's overall acceptance rate, apparently 7.8%. Prof. Erickson's predicted acceptance rate is about 12%, which is also the same overall rate at NU. So I think its similar. Compare that 12% to the overall 62% acceptance rate of UIUC...."

chicago,3dutby,zootam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"I would like a Masters, but my previous field had nothing to do with Computer Science (only tangentially) so I would need to take courses to boost my grades and retake ACT/SAT since they were unfortunately not just high enough to be that good, and hopefully I can get a Masters instead of a second Bachelors, which is not very fun to think about but a bridge that must be crossed if thats all I can do!  I definitely didn't specify 10 years, but I did say I want to go into a new field, which implies previous work experience.  Computer Science has been around for decades, and is by no means a new field."
chicago,3dutby,GeorgieFruit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"but I did say I want to go into a new field, which implies previous work experience.    Yea but that could be as little as 1 year of work experience, not necessarily 10.   so I would need to take courses to boost my grades and retake ACT/SAT since they were unfortunately not just high enough to be that good   I don't think they're going to attribute much value to a 25-35 year old person retaking the ACT/SAT, its not even on the admissions page or application for UIUC  its mostly about college GPA and your CV/resume and letters of recommendation.  your ACT/SAT would go into your transcript, but  you'd have to ask every school you're interested in how they would value a new ACT/SAT score with respect to master's admission. (and make sure you're not wasting time and money studying and doing something that won't really help)  but yea go to community college and take a bunch of CS courses, do really well, build some projects of your own, and go from there. Its going to take at least 1-2 years to get enough coursework and experience."

The food is wonderful. I suggest simones for burgers (and beers if you are into that), dia de Los tamales is a great unique tamale spot on 18th. Bennys pizza for a quick slice. Mary's is a little hole in the wall Mexican spot with, I am totally convinced, the best food in the city. Bodhi Thai is relatively new and really really tasty. 18th street has a lot of great shops and you are in an awesome spot right there by Morgan. Honkey tonk BBQ is a great bar and BBQ spot that does live music late in the week and on weekends. Bow truss for coffee or the jumping bean which is more of a classic pilsen staple. Right next to you will be a two cafes with decent coffee and great treats like muffins: Kristoffers (awesome bakery too) and la catrina cafe. As for groceries you have to go west down 18th to la casa del pueblo. Amazing prices and really good produce.   I realize all I did was talk about food so if there is anything else you were wondering I could cover that too. Lol."

The encroachment of white people into the community is part of the trend, so OP would indeed be in the process of making it a white neighborhood.    It also seems that OP hasn't visited the community in quite a while, so I was merely suggesting that the spaces that are being talked about in the comments tend to reflect food/coffee.  None of the places listed, talk about the things have been in Pilsen for quite a while.  The taquerias and paleterias that add to the charm of the neighborhood are ignored for newer stuff.

It's about a two hour drive to northwest Illinois to the farmland around Elizabeth, IL. Or drive out even further into the farmland southwest of Iowa City, IA.   You can see the Milky Way tonight starting at astronomical twilight which is RIGHT NOW (10:30 pm). Tonight's a great night if it's clear skies where you're at. You'd see it on the south/southeast horizon. Also look up the International Space Station tracker, maybe they'd have a flyover tonight.  The next ideal time for a Milky Way viewing is August 14-15th because the moon is new then. If the skies are clear as well, the Milky Way is visible to the south/southwest horizon at about 10pm."

Also, I think a restaurant with a bar has a little different vibe and might be better for a woman who is alone, there are many downtown, these two might fit the bill:  Tapas Valencia - a Spanish tapas restaurant that is a short cab or bus ride from your hotel. Spanish food is NOT Mexican food, it is Mediterranean food. I think it would be a good type of food for you to try, it will be new for you but not too different or intimidating to order, they have some really good meat tapas, the faldilla is excellent.  www.tapasvalencia.com  Also, maybe the Gage:  http://www.thegagechicago.com"

You're a fish in a school of them. We don't talk to each other or make eye contact unless we're sizing someone up.   Interacting with panhandlers makes you a target for their attention. At the same time, they are humans, so please don't laugh and take pictures of them like a couple of friends of mine from home did.   If you've got a smartphone, use OpenTable for restaurants, Uber for cabs, and Grubhub for takeout. If you want something easy to do, buy some snacks, take a walk a few blocks south and check out Millennium Park (and the Bean). There's live music and great people watching most evenings."
chicago,3dqq17,killjoie,5,Sat Jul 18 18:41:39 2015 UTC,"I would like to go out on my own and explore the city after 8pm.   I make this. Sync it to your smart phone. It will guide you to some fun but non-tourist activities. It has info, start and end times, maps, links to the original event, etc etc.   Is this safe for a petite woman walking around that area alone at night?   This is the biggest BIGGEST misconception about Chicago. Our violent crime per capita is on par with Buffalo, New York. There are like 15 other cities which are far, far worse per capita than we are.  Additionally, all of those shootings you hear about? Are primarily concentrated around two neighborhoods rife with gang activity. They are Austin to the far far far west, where you have literally zero chance of going. And Englewood to the semi-further south. Another area you have zero chance of going. Here is the map. I think last year in 2014 we had ONE shooting downtown. It was a disgruntled employee who had been fired by his business partner. Don't own a multimillion dollar business and fire founding members depriving them of their share of the company and you should be fine?  Let me put it this way. Of everyone I have ever known in my entire life, only one of them (my father) has ever been shot at. And that was in the far west suburbs.  Your biggest risk is falling victim to the people begging for money so they can buy food. As someone who has lived blocks away from where you will be staying for 8 or 9 years. I can guarantee you that those people begging don't want food. They want money for alcohol. I have tried to give out sealed Soprafina lunch boxes and they won't take them (Oh uh....I'm allergic), or they will take them and throw them away. Seriously like 1/12 of them will actually be grateful for food. Do not give them money.   If you absolutely must because you feel bad, take them into 7/11 or something and buy them some food. Many of them will try to throw alcohol on the counter right when you are paying for their food. Do not let them.  There are also the more aggressive beggars, who look rather like you and I, and will stop you. ""Hey do you know where this train/bus station is? I am trying to get home and my [insert relative here] said they would pick me up. But I'm short $5 and trying to catch the last bus to [Indiana/Wisconsin/Michigan]. I love your city and had so much fun but the people here just seem so rude and won't help out. I was hoping you would change my mind on that.""  Just say ""sorry I don't have cash or my cards on me right now, good luck!"".  Time and time and time again people visiting our city say we are the nicest fucking people of all the places they have travelled. Personally I think we're assholes, but I only have Chicagoans to compare Chicagoans to. So apparently everywhere else people are SUPER assholes?   If I visited a bar to get a drink by myself, would people think I'm weird?   Nah. ESPECIALLY outside. We have tons of sidewalk dining in the summer. We just opened our riverwalk, which you will be right next to. It is literally across the street from where you are. Go grab a beer at the fries and beer place down the steps. Plenty of people sitting out there drinking a beer alone. I bring my dog on occasion.  For extra advice:  Do not go to Navy Pier. Just don't. It is just terrible nicknack shit stores for tourists. The only reason I go to Navy Pier is for the IMAX theater. If you absolutely need to ride the ferris wheel, fine. If you want to go to the end of Navy Pier for the view, I highly suggest the view from Adler Planetarium instead.   Things in the area to see, I have already mentioned the riverwalk. But check out Millennium Park (tons of free concerts there are night) and Maggie Daley Park (they have some pretty huge slides).   If you are exceedingly paranoid, the TSA allows for ONE container 4 ounces or less of pepper spray in your CHECKED (not carry on) luggage so long as it contains a safety device to prevent accidental discharge. I make my girlfriend carry it with her, but only because she has to hoof it way down south to some seriously questionable neighborhoods because she is a nurse and has clinicals at various hospitals.  If you are the type of person who has always been interested in cities, you will have a good time. Chicago is one of the most beautiful, cleanest MAJOR cities in the world. We are known for our architecture. I do suggest one of the river and lake architecture boat tours.  Also if you could throw some extra money our way in taxes that'd be great thanks :)"

Stay on streets with people (there will be tons of people around your area, so this is totally easy), and don't stare at your phone distractedly.  Go to River North and find a place that looks cool to you there. My advice is if you go to a bar there alone, try to connect and make small talk with the bartender, tell him/her your story, they get TONS of tourists in that area, can steer you in a cool, safe direction.  But again, I guarantee you you will be 100% safe. These are all mostly common sense tips. Taking cabs is safe also, you can just wave them down if they have their top light on.

I have cousins there who are horrified by the nearest ""big"" city (250,000 including suburbs).  My cousins do have to drive to a mall to shop, because yes, even there, the downtowns have been put out of business, but the mall isn't in a big town, it's basically in the middle of nowhere, but accessible from a lot of rural directions.  I traveled ""out of my town"" pretty often, because my grandparents and cousins live on rural routes, technically not part of any town, but I was pretty old before I saw a city.    Lots of local girls marry some guy and don't travel much.  And this was on the east coast, where distances are distances are small compared to Nebraska.  This doesn't really add up as trollery.

After the Indians had managed to tie the game, a 19-year-old fan named Terry Yerkic ran onto the field and attempted to steal Texas outfielder Jeff Burroughs' cap. Confronting the fan, Burroughs tripped. Thinking that Burroughs had been attacked, Texas manager Billy Martin charged onto the field with his players right behind, some wielding bats. A large number of intoxicated fans – some armed with knives, chains, and portions of stadium seats that they had torn apart – surged onto the field, and others hurled bottles from the stands. Hundreds of fans surrounded the outnumbered Rangers. Realizing that the Rangers' lives might be in danger, Cleveland manager Ken Aspromonte ordered his players to grab bats and help the Rangers, attacking the team's own fans in the process. Rioters began throwing steel folding chairs, and Cleveland relief pitcher Tom Hilgendorf was hit in the head by one of them. Hargrove, after subduing one rioter in a fistfight, had to fight another on his way back to the Texas dugout.

chicago,3dn9o1,mattfromchicago,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:14:48 2015 UTC,"What? The city can choose what it funds. Also, fun fact, TIF money that is normally earmarked for beautification like this directly comes from tax funds diverted from education."
chicago,3dn9o1,AdventureArtist,0,Sat Jul 18 12:01:29 2015 UTC,"CPS is not part of the city government so their budget would be unaffected by whatever beautification projects the city undertakes.  TIF money does divert funds from the school system, but it diverts funds from all taxing bodies, so the city, county, party district, etc. all share the sacrifice.  Though, the mayor recently announced he was letting downtown TIF districts expire (and I'm not even sure if the Riverwalk is in a TIF district) so they won't be spending as much money downtown as in recent years."
chicago,3dn9o1,mattfromchicago,0,Sat Jul 18 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"To say that one budget doesn't affect the other is ludacris. Chicago has $10 bucks. They spend $3 on schools, and $7 on other stuff. If they have $11, they can spend the extra dollar on either. When they have $9, they take that dollar from either.   Also, Education makes up a huge part of that taxing bodies pie. Over the last 10 years of TIFS, millions of dollars have been diverted from Chicago's poorest children for things just like these lights. Also, I don't believe that downtown is going TIF free, although an area is supposed to be ""blighted"" to qualify. Every year multi millions are swept up and go into the profits of large companies, instead of the bellies and minds of poor children."

I had just moved and was trying to do HDMI over CAT via HDBaseT.   But every single HDBaseT unit I purchased would die like 3 days later. Which was not supposed to happen. So I would return it and buy another model. Same thing happened. I went through quite a few different brands to troubleshoot the issue. Same thing kept happening.  I tried HDMI surge protectors. I tried HDMI signal boosters. Nothing. Finally I broke down and bought a super expensive receiver which had HDBaseT built in. Zero issues. But then the receiver didn't do specifically what I needed it to do (treated HDBaseT as a 2nd zone and did not do 5.1+, only stereo), so I had to go back to the stand alone HDBaseT units.  Worked just fine. Turned out to be something about my old receiver was breaking the units. Later I read that because of the way HDCP works, sometimes the HDBaseT receivers would get stuck in a weird state and not work. Functionally they were fine, but would need to be reset at the manufacturer, which took forever.  Anyway, Amazon does return fraud detection right.

chicago,3dmw8z,rheinhart,11,Fri Jul 17 17:57:20 2015 UTC,This article mentions nothing about why the inmate is in jail or their previous criminal history.  That's extremely pertinent information to making sweeping generalizations without any statics or even anecdotal stories.  Even the quote they got from a jail rep only confirms that people can't make bail.  There are tons of people that can't make bail and the number increases with the severity of the offense/prior history.

Plus what you're suggesting is that the majority of those juveniles that are awaiting trial excessively are scary out of control teenagers when the inverse could be equally truie IE most of the juveniles were charged with minor non-violent offenses and can't make the bail as it's determined by a judge.

The discovery process can take some time but the issue is that bond is set too high for them to make bail and be free on the street.    I'm pretty sure that if they had an egregious example of someone who is demanding immediate trial they would provide it.  These people are given court appointed defense who are acting on their behalf and continuing trial dates.  They don't provide an example of anyone demanding trial and waiting 3 years."

chicago,3dmw8z,sparr,0,Fri Jul 17 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"They also say that bail is not set when someone is considered to be a danger to society... Since all of these people have bail, you can rule out most of the worst crimes."

For example, for communities, if you remove power from public schools and close them down, you destabilize communities. Destablizing communities means more crime.   On the other side, you remove power from public schools and place them into the Arne Duncan-style of charter schools, then education becomes a secondary priority behind generating profits that don't have nearly the same restrictions as public-generated revenue.   And that's just the field of education. Real estate, sales taxes, Ventra, etc., all follow the same pattern (it's no mistake that the former head of the CTA is now head of CPS).

A judge often times will favor a particular side though and lets things slide. My brother was involved in a custody case and the girl skipped some 3 dates with no repercussions resulted in more continuations and lost time for him. He had missed just 1 of the appearances and that was due entirely to his lawyer giving him the wrong court date. That caused him to lose custody of his son and it took months to sort. I have seen cops not show up as well and the judges set a new date no consequences. I guess my point is, you can't depend on the court system to be consistent or in your favor."

My cousin's got to play in the team game.  My mom knew a guy who was bozo's bff.  That's how we got on.  Wizzo was an alcoholic.  Drunk during the show.  For real.  Doo Dee Doo Dee Dooooooo...

We got a picture with Bozo, Cookie, and Professor Andy. Wizzo was not there and he's who I wanted to meet.   No grand prize game for us. The one thing that did stand out to me is the line to get in was horrendously long. It was unbearable for 2nd grade me.   I'd heard the stories as an adult that people had to wait years for tickets but nobody ever mentioned that in my family. I wonder how long they had to wait."

I really felt the meeting was disjointed, while my neighbors were exchanging information with the police, it seemed rather one-sided, and really could have been handled over e-mail.  So great, I got a sheet of all the crimes that happened since the last meeting, the officers weren't briefed or didn't know the details of shootings a beat over from them, everything was on paper, no computers or Powerpoint deck. I've briefed a Command level groups as well as other organizations, and this was just sad watching this.  I know Rahm figures crime is down, and they aren't hiring police as fast as they should and I also understand this is one of the more attended CAPS meetings in Chicago.

Her temporary replacement was very sweet, but ran the meetings poorly.  The permanent replacement, Mike, runs the meetings marginally better, but I find him arrogant, talks around the issues, and doesn't seem to have a handle on the real facts in most situations.  Combine that with his timing of combining beats (which I ultimately think is good, it was piss poor some beats only meet every other month), it's resulted as a cluster lately.  After every meeting for the last year, I leave thinking I just wasted an hour of my life.  Really wanted to attend this CAPS, but the cold I had just levelled me.  Prior month meeting was best attended ever, hot button issue was the two Hamlin shootings.  Drive for me this month was the McD's shooting, and the July 4th shooting, as I knew the victim and his family.  Wanted to see what they shared.  I also wanted to ask Mike was the heavy use of police presence in Indie Park on 4th of July to shut down the fireworks effective since all it did was drive people to the alleys, where it was more unsafe for home owners, and shootings should have been more important.  Honestly, I don't think Rahm figures crime is down.  I think how he figures is how can he spin it that way."

chicago,3do8um,erudite_eros,12,Fri Jul 17 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this is super ""back of the envelope"" and I am going to make a ton of assumptions but here goes ...  Assumptions:   CO Population 5.4 M IL Population 12:9 M Assume similar rate of pot use by over all population Based on population assume IL will receive approx twice the amount in revenue as CO (obviously the IL population is more than twice CO's but it's good enough for now) Assume similar tax rates   CO Revenue from Marijuana Tax, Fees, and Licenses https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/0515%20Marijuana%20Tax%2C%20License%2C%20and%20Fees%20Report.pdf  The Math:   Based on May 2015 YTD tax collection CO earns $20.5 M in additional revenue per month (102.4 M collected YTD 2015  102.4/5 = 20.48) CO earns $246 M in revenue for 2015  ( 20.5 X 12 = 246) IL doubles that for $492 M, so lets just say $500 M in additional revenue   So $500 M not bad, but ...  http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150119/BLOGS02/150119831/illinois-budget-deficit-twice-as-bad-as-you-think   Illinois' fiscal woes are significantly deeper and more serious than generally realized, with the state facing a $9 billion operating deficit in the fiscal year that begins July 1  ... with the hole in the current fiscal 2015 budget ... $6 billion, and rising to a projected $9 billion in fiscal 2016 and hitting $14 billion by fiscal 2026, assuming no changes in law or spending practices.   Conclusion Marijuana Legalization could reduce the deficit and 'ease the pain' but wouldn't come close to closing it.  However  You wold also see an uptick in ""pot tourism"" from the other states and possibly internationally especially considering the number of cheap direct flights from all over the US and the World flying into O'Hare and Midway.  That would mean a boost to all travel and leisure taxes such as occupancy taxes, airport concessions, restaurants, tourist spots, etc. as well as a jobs boost in related industries.  Additionally, you would see a substantial drop in crime  of all types (""I smelled weed."" would no longer be probable cause for police to stop/search/enter the home of anyone) and the cost of policing, prosecuting, and imprisoning people for drug offenses and other charges that related from the aforementioned ""I smelled weed"" probably cause).  Of course you would also see a drop in revenue from tickets and fines that also resulted from the ""I smelled weed"" situation.   What all that additional revenue, cost savings, and even lost revenue could add up to would take a far smarter person than I to even guess at.  EDIT: And a complete analysis/model should also include the stimulative effect of hundreds or thousands of more residents working, earning an income, paying incomes/sales/etc taxes instead of just sitting in prison and costing the state revenue instead of helping generate it."

chicago,3do8um,KershawsBabyMama,4,Fri Jul 17 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"I think that the decriminalization of cannabis couldn't hurt. The saving but not having a few thousand people locked up cannot be dismissed, between 50-100MM.  Add that to another 50MM in taxes (using colorado's numbers). Then take in some of the indirect benefits, people not going to jail paying taxes and buying stuff.  It makes up half of the school cuts.  While it is a ""drop in the bucket"" and we continue to dick around the edges instead of just raising property taxes or income taxes, it would provide revenue to programs that really need the money."
chicago,3do8um,tossme68,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:21:07 2015 UTC,"Most of the people who sell cannabis will just move onto another controlled substance if they aren't already diversified. They are in it for the easy, tax free money involved. I seem to recall someone on here saying they quit their legit job at checkers because they could make more money for less work selling narcotics. I don't think anyone wants to legalize coke, meth, heroin or designer drugs. The taxes and well...work involved in going legit with pot will dissuade most. Those who deal without paying the tax for being legit will just go in for white collar tax evasion. No real savings, just a reallocation. Moving deck chairs on the titanic."

chicago,3do8um,the_koob,0,Fri Jul 17 22:21:21 2015 UTC,"Colorado has made like $70 million from taxes and fees with a population a little less than half of Illinois. Unless you anticipate a way warmer response from a (largely) much more conservative state we're looking at a couple hundred million in revenue max. Certainly not just a drop in the bucket, but definitely not enough to close a multi-billion dollar pension deficit (Though the other positive externalities from decriminalization will certainly help on the budget, too).  Like I said, this tax is likely a necessarily condition, but not sufficient to fix the budget problems with the state/city."
chicago,3do8um,KershawsBabyMama,0,Sat Jul 18 00:28:17 2015 UTC,it would help in the same way as you giving $1 to the city for free would help.    What the actual fuck?

chicago,3do8um,KershawsBabyMama,5,Sat Jul 18 00:30:28 2015 UTC,You do realize the tax revenue from Marijuana legalization would generate hundreds of millions in additional revenue annually.  It wouldn't 'solve' the problem but it sure would help.
chicago,3do8um,BDB_JCD,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"I do realize that. Which is why I say it's helpful in the same way literally giving a small amount of money is helpful.

chicago,3do8um,KershawsBabyMama,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"I say If an extra $300 million dollars won't entirely recoup years of budget mishandling, then we'd be better off without any of it."

Owen & Engine, Logan Square - guess where I live? Still, the food is great, the burger special is great, they have some damn good beer & staff.  Iberico Cafe, River North - Best place for tapas, lots of seating, cheap pitchers of sangria.  The Berghoff, Loop - Not the cheapest, and not as good since they stopped doing the carving stations for lunch, but if I want a reuben and a beer for lunch, this is it.   Piece, Wicker Park - Only if I'm going out, delivery is something else. New Haven style pizza is my favorite, and they have good beer.  Great Seas, Albany Park - Good Chinese food, but it's the wings here. If I'm in the neighborhood, I almost have to stop in for an order of their wings.  Fiori's, Ukranian Villiage - Italian Deli. Italian Subs. Great salads, too. This place is a great stop for picnic food, or just when you want to remember what a real Italian sub is supposed to taste like. Bonus: they make and sell their giardinera by the gallon.  Bite Cafe, Wicker Park - I've been getting brunch here since you could smoke in the booths. They had a rough patch a few years ago, but Bite is always one of the choices if I'm suggesting brunch.   Quenchers, Logan Square - Just throwing in this one as a good place to get a beer, day or night. It's the first place I think of if I'm going out for one... or five."

Explain to me how the ministry was responsible for their safety?"
chicago,3dm607,NodbuggerX,0,Fri Jul 17 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of ways to establish duty.  I think you're trying to say that duty ceases when an intentional tortfeasor is involved, which is generally true. But not here. The way to establish duty in this scenario is foreseeability AND a special relationship.  By assuming custody of the guy, the half-way house established this special relationship. Restatement of Torts Second 319 states ""One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.""  The existence of a special relationship imposes duties upon a party where normally the law would not, such as protecting another from criminal attack by third party or to render aid.  Again See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 319  So that's why the ministry owed a duty to the general public when they took custody of a known repeat rapist.  I'm not making this shit, it's literally basic tort law.    Edit: had cited 314 when I meant 319."
chicago,3dm607,kepleronlyknows,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:58 2015 UTC,"That is all basic tort law, but none of it applies here.  The relationship you are using would be between the ministry and the man, not a totally unrelated third party. The custodian is responsible for what happens to the ward, not necesarily what the ward does. Especially when the ward is outside the control of custodian. If these women were raped at the ministry, sure. Outside of it because the ward escaped? Yeah, no. Unless they let the guy out or the security measures they agreed to weren't met, they aren't responsible. Especially when you consider these aren't prisoners and are not confined to this location."
chicago,3dm607,NodbuggerX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"Alternately,  ""Administrator of woman raped and murdered by convicted felon during felon's departure from privately operated halfway house brought action against operator of halfway house, alleging negligence . . . . the Supreme Court, Russell, J., held that operator had duty to exercise reasonable care to control felon so as to prevent him from causing harm to victim.""  ""If a dangerous prisoner escapes custody, penniless and on foot, in a remote, unpopulated area, and is soon recaptured, the class of potential victims foreseeably at risk during the time of his escape may be very small indeed. By contrast, if a dangerous prisoner is allowed, by a defendant's negligence, to run at large in a city throughout the nighttime hours, the class of potential victims at risk may extend to all who are present within the area to which the prisoner will foreseeably have access during the period of his freedom.Applying those principles to the present case, we hold that Debbie Dudley Davis, although not foreseeably at risk as an individual, was a member of a class consisting of those persons “within a given area of danger”-that is, the area foreseeably accessible to Spencer during his hours at large on the streets of Richmond on the night of September 19, 1987, as a result of OAR's negligent failure to control him.

Rather than try to explain it over and over again, here's a case nearly identical to the present scenario which I found with a very easy search of westlaw, there are tons more, and it sums up exactly this issue.     Holdings: The District Court held that:1 halfway house owed duty of care to community;2 fact issue existed as to foreseeability of murder;3 halfway house's duty of care was not extinguished by release of inmate later implicated in murder, or by local parole agency's assumption of his supervision;4 five-month interval between inmate's release and murder did not preclude operator's liability, on theory of remoteness;5 murder, and parole agency's supervision, were not superseding causes precluding operator's liability; and6 Maryland statute of limitations applied to wrongful death claim.   Smith v. Hope Vill., Inc., 481 F. Supp. 2d 172 (D.D.C. 2007)  In particular, the court stated: ""First, it is simply illogical to conclude that Hope Village's [the half-way house] allegedly negligent contribution to the premature release of Kelly into the community would extinguish its duty to protect that same community from reasonably foreseeable harm incurred as a result of the premature release itself."""

chicago,3dm607,NodbuggerX,2,Fri Jul 17 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's do this.  A line by line analysis of why nearly everything you write is wrong.  This time with sources!   They didn't have any duty outside their contractual obligation from the city.   Duty is established because the halfway house and the rapist had a custodian-ward ""special relationship"" as defined by Restatement (Second) of Torts § 319 ""One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm."" This special relationship duty applies specifically to criminal acts.    They are a private organization, it isn't their job to stop criminals.   Again, see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 319.   And the Supreme Court has said that you can't even sue the police or the government because you were victim of crime. The only one responsible is the criminal.   You're describing either sovereign or qualified immunity, both of which only apply the government itself, not an organization like this ministry.  And even then, there are exceptions. From Cornell.. “Qualified immunity balances two important interests—the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.” Pearson v. Callahan (07-751). Specifically, it protects government officials from lawsuits alleging that they violated plaintiffs’ rights, only allowing suits where officials violated a “clearly established” statutory or constitutional right.""   And no one has ever won when they sued a zoo.   Here's one of literally hundreds of cases on zoo liability that show up in a Westlaw search.. Moloney v. City of Columbus, 208 N.E.2d 141, 146 (1965) (""For the above reasons, it is the opinion of this court that the defendant is engaged in a proprietary function in owning,  operating, and maintaining a zoo; that the defendant is liable for its tortious conduct in such owning, operating and maintaining a zoo"")    The cities that own them have just settled, even though the people injured all did stupid things like climb fences or stick their arms into cages.   See the above case, and many others, where the city or whomever owned a zoo has not ""just settled"".   Animals can't be held liable, but their owners can.   Hey, this one is right!   An animal hurting someone is no different than the owner hurting someone.   Of course it's different.  When an animal (not including ""wild"" animals, different law applies there) harms someone, the owner will not be held liable unless they knew or should have known of the danger.  Which has lead to the legal joke pertaining to dog bites that ""you get one bite free"". When a human bites someone, no such rule applies, for obvious reasons.   Same with the drunk driver, the driver is the one who personally caused the damages.   Sure, but unlike what you're trying to argue, bars and bartenders are still held liable for over-serving patrons. Stetson University.     In this instance, the ministry neither owned this person nor did the ministry cause any harm. The rapist caused harm.   See argument number one and two establishing duty and liability.   The rapist should be the one sued as the ministry has no obligation to safeguard anyone outside of the ministry.   Again, see argument number one and two.  Also, of course the rapist can be sued. But he probably broke as shit.  TL;DR the only correct statement in your entire post is ""Animals can't be held liable""  Edit: cited to restatement of torts §314 when I meant §319"
chicago,3dm607,kepleronlyknows,0,Fri Jul 17 22:16:48 2015 UTC,"In a custodian-ward relationship the obligations of the custodian are to the ward, not to a third party. The custodian has no obligation to a third party. They have no duty to protect that third person in this instance.   The only way they would is two circumstances, there was a statutory requirement that they are or they made a promise/contract to protect the third party.   A person escaping from a halfway house was one of the first negligence torts hypothetical I ever did in a tort class.   Here is an example from Indiana."
chicago,3dm607,NodbuggerX,2,Fri Jul 17 22:42:03 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I goofed and cited §314 when I meant §319:  ""One who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.""  But the case you cited actually argues exactly my point:  ""Thus, Ms. Bailor must demonstrate that the Salvation Army had the legal right to control Holly, did actually control Holly, and had knowledge of his propensity for violence.""  That court determined that the half-way house in that case did not actually control the perp, because.. ""Under its arrangement with the government, the Salvation Army facility, as a halfway house, could not detain a resident.   Residents were free to leave, provided they signed a sign-out sheet.""  Here, this rapist was not free to leave, and in fact the half-way house was negligent in allowing him to escape.  It's completely distinguishable.    Now please rebutt the multiple cases I've cited to you finding half-way houses which do maintain custody of inmates are liable when they escape and rape members of the community."

Military life can be pretty stressful and giving everyone a pistol would needlessly escalate situations.  I do think there should be a military police presence at all sites where there are unarmed soldiers though.  And before I get a bunch of comments about how we carry guns in war, it's very different.  There are few opportunities to mess up in a way that puts your career in jeopardy in a war zone and people who are awful garrison soldiers are usually on point downrange. The stress mainly comes from people its OK to shoot anyway. In America all your stress is coming from family and coworkers. It's an important distinction and speaking from experience I would feel much safer with only military police and people on official guard duty being armed."

Plenty of other occupations deal with similar stressful situations, yet they are allowed to be armed -- why don't we hear about a ton of other ""needlessly escalated situations""?

If an armed civilian was able to just waltz on base on start shooting people, what's to stop someone in uniform from leaving base and retrieving their gun?   I would feel much safer with only military police and people on official guard duty being armed.   And if you were one of the 4 marines gunned down by a crazy fundamentalist in Chatanooga (or in Fort Hood, the Washington Navy Yard, etc), you'd probably feel differently.

chicago,3dmhii,barryicide,6,Fri Jul 17 18:56:10 2015 UTC,He only managed to shoot four people before he got his head blown off. He wouldn't have even done that with my suggestion. The number of people dying in needlessly escalated violence would far exceed how many people currently die from terrorist attacks.  If the attacks ramped up I would support everyone carrying but that's because we would basically be fighting a war on our own soil at that point.    As someone who was in alot of firefights I don't really see a benefit to having an armed civilian population. We would get shot at all day everyday and really never worry about bullets because of our equipment and firepower. All my friends who died died from explosions. Everyone walking around with guns just gives people permanent solutions to temporary problems and doesn't do anything to an actual coordinated fighting force imo.

Based on what statistics, fact, etc? You feel that it would far exceed, but feelings are not objective evidence. The states (all 50 of 'em now, Illinois was the last) all had anti-gunners yelling about how there'd be blood in the streets and murder rates would sky-rocket... yet none of that ever happened. Why would it happen with the military population when it never happened with the civilian population (many civilian permit holders are former military)?   He wouldn't have even done that with my suggestion.   What suggestion? You suggested having only MPs and active guards be armed. That doesn't solve the problem of someone getting past them (see the Fort Hood or Navy Yard shootings). Unless they physically pat down or scan every single person who goes in to the base, guards provide no defense (and even then, very little, because most bases have hard to protect perimeters and as I suggested, it'd be very easy to throw a bag over, go through security, and then be free to do evil deeds)."

Permit holders carry of their own volition you want to arm millions of people weather they want to carry or not.    The fort Hood guy and the naval yard guy were both stopped by police.  The fort Hood guy even managed to kill people who were shooting directly at him and some of the people who got shot were actually caught in the crossfire.

chicago,3dj9bv,claypoolfan,8,Fri Jul 17 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"Just signed up...I'm actually really impressed with this program. After filling the application out you get a membership keychain on the spot, a bike map, a guide for biking in Chicago, and a HELMET! I wasn't expecting that one. All they ask for is proof of income (1 recent paycheck will do) and a state ID. If you do not have income like the homeless man who was signing up at the same time as me, there is a form you can fill out and it appears to ask very few questions. I am not sure what the consequences are from lying on it though.  The membership covers unlimited 30 minute rides. If you go over 30 min, you get billed separately. They have your address and email to be able to contact you for this reason.   I'm 99% sure you can dock at a station for a minute and then check the bike back out if you're traveling somewhere that takes longer than 30minutes. If a dock is full of bikes and you can't return yours, you can press a button on the kiosk thing which provides you an additional 15 minutes to get to another station while alerting Divvy to the station.   I'm impressed. They actually have provided a service that offers real assistance to this city. EDIT spelling."
chicago,3dj9bv,trollhunta,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for your thoughtful summary of the process.
chicago,3dj9bv,mattfromchicago,0,Fri Jul 17 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"Interesting, they take down your address and mail you bills if you go over... Wonder what the payment terms are on the bills, and I wonder what would happen if you just moved. Did Divvy hire a debt collection agency? Perhaps."
chicago,3dj9bv,trollhunta,5,Fri Jul 17 19:00:43 2015 UTC,Wondering this as well. Maybe you get a strike or two and then your account is disabled unless you pay the fee somehow?
chicago,3dj9bv,mattfromchicago,6,Thu Jul 16 20:51:13 2015 UTC,Strikes probably don't matter so much if you don't intend to ever return the bike. $5 bike seems like a good deal.

Other cities with bikeshare networks have similar programs for low income residents and have experienced little loss as result.  Plus, if you've actually ridden one of these bikes, you'd know they're both incredibly recognizable and a pain in the ass to ride for very long.  It's probably far easier for someone looking to snatch a bike to just bust a cheap U-lock and get a decent bike than steal one of these pianos."

chicago,3dj9bv,vse0,3,Sat Jul 18 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"I felt broke in the city making slightly more than you do. But that was my fault, I decided to live in a 1 bedroom downtown instead of in a more affordable neighborhood with a roommate or two.  The thing I have noticed about the job market is that you're never going to get more money unless you switch jobs. IF you get raises at work, you're probably looking at like yearly 1% and maybe 3% if you're fucking lucky.  Switching jobs is how I increased my salary by a lot. Going from my first job out of college to my second job doubled my salary. 2nd to 3rd  was a 33.3% increase. 3rd to 4th was a 30% increase. And going by jobs being posted to LinkedIn, a potential 4th to 5th would be a 45% increase.  But I'm going to stay where I am for as long as possible. And my rule for switching jobs is 3 years minimum at a place, even if I hate it. 3 years seems to be the point where no one really questions your jumping around jobs. I absolutely hated my 3rd employer (the last one), but I stuck it out.  The other thing, for anyone reading this. Is the thing that helped me the most in doing this was knowing exactly what the salary ranges for other people in my industry were. My coworkers were nice enough to (privately) share their salary info with me, and this helped me understand and negotiate throughout the years.  The whole ""don't share your salary info with anyone"" is bullshit perpetuated by HR to keep people from knowing what they are worth. Do not be afraid to talk about salary. It isn't tacky (in the right circumstances) and it can really help other people out. A rising tide lifts all boats."

They lose out on quality talent. The culture becomes old and stagnant, since they have a hard time attracting 20 somethings or recent grads, the offices are full mainly of 40 and 50 year old suburban dwellers. Doing something like simply moving downtown can re-energize the workforce and change the culture, which thus spawns innovation and change.   I'm very happy to hear this news. I can't count how many great paying jobs I've turned down which I've been headhunted for simply because nope, I refuse to work in the suburbs.

chicago,3disib,TheJPdude,9,Fri Jul 17 17:37:43 2015 UTC,Sears makes no sense. It's close to absolutely nothing. I cannot understand how people would agree to commute there from the city.
chicago,3disib,jbiresq,9,Thu Jul 16 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"Because at the time they relocated there, it was a different world. The trend was for companies to move away from downtown to save money since more people were moving to the burbs, getting married younger, etc. It was much more still a car-centric culture. In 2015, it's literally reversed, people get married later, want public transit and bike commuting, and want to be single and in the city, and now companies are flocking back to urban centers. But yeah, you're right, it's close to nothing and I would never commute that way either.   I have a friend who works at Conagra. They're out in Naperville. She commutes 2 fucking hours each day, blue line to Metra. She does well there and salary wise but still. 4 hours out of your life each day? Fuck that noise."
chicago,3disib,R_TOKAR,9,Thu Jul 16 19:06:12 2015 UTC,I used to commute out to North Chicago from Lincoln Square and one day (while sitting in traffic) I calculated that I was spending an entire month of my year commuting/sitting in traffic.   So done with that.
chicago,3disib,linds360,6,Thu Jul 16 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"20 hours a week man. When I got my first job, I was working 40/week. Fairly standard. And I was paid below market value and they knew it.   But my commute from the suburbs post college was 3 hours a day. 15 hours a week. So basically like working weekends. When I moved downtown, people asked me why. ""That's so expensive! You must work like 50 hours a week! Not worth it!"".   Actually yes, totally worth it. If I work 50 hours a week with 0 commuting, I'm ahead of the 55 hours a week wasted working+commuting. And I'll have more equity stashed away after a number of years.   So I really don't mind working 10 hour days now. Because its much better than 8 hour days with 3 hour commutes."

chicago,3disib,R_TOKAR,11,Fri Jul 17 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"""Moving to the city"" is how you get rid of the 40 and 50 year old dead weight. It is the ability to lay off without actually laying off."
chicago,3disib,jjo_southside,25,Thu Jul 16 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"Probably not.   Those 40, 50 year olds are probably driving from one far flung suburb to another far flung suburb through traffic, rain, snow, construction, etc.  Now with the office downtown they can take Metra and avoid all that.  I was working at Com Ed/Exelon as a consultant when they decided to move offices to the suburbs and the suburban employees were pissed.  For most of them their commute times were going to increase.  The convenience of commuting downtown on Metra was a huge plus for them.  EDIT: Downvoted for pointing out that many suburban commuters prefer mass transit to driving in a blizzard.  Hysterical.  You know how many uber rich north shore residents take Metra instead of driving their 80k cars because they can avoid bad weather, bad traffic, and can get work done on the commute?  Go check the packed Metra parking lots in the northern burbs sometime."

chicago,3disib,splork-chop,8,Fri Jul 17 02:04:30 2015 UTC,"Taking public transportation for them would be a hard adjustment.

They hold the knowledge and leadership capability that's required to be profitable and successful. Unless you're on manufacturing line, your new and younger employees cannot do the work of experienced staff.    I work in process transformation and know first hand that you can't just wipe out staff and expect the new people to carry the weight. Ideally, we don't wipe out any positions when we lean a company down. We transform jobs to retain that experience because that's who's going to teach and mentor our younger staff. If we lose experience, our younger staff is bound to make the same mistakes their predecessors made. We're essentially re-inventing the wheel and going backwards in evolution.    That said, I don't work for stupid companies. There might be leadership that's so bad they think this would work. But unless your friend is in a c-suite position or consultant to, they're probably incorrect. Kraft is a mature company with experienced talent.

chicago,3disib,Fap_Left_Surf_Right,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:16:57 2015 UTC,"Those are good points Faps, but to have a spirited debate, don't you think that complacency plays a part in a stagnant workforce? I think a healthy mix of young and seasoned is key. Sure you may have an experienced middle manager of 50 years old, but that dude doesn't really give a shit to change anything, he's got nothing to prove, and is comfortable with his salary and his kids are already done with college. He's waiting to retire.   Whereas you have a bright eyed 25 year old fresh grad, this kid wants to be noticed, he's going out of his way, working off the clock writing a process improvement proposal and shit.   I think there is a fine line between relying solely on your older mgmt teams for mentorship, which is what they should be focused on for the younger folks anyway, and not focused on the future assets of you organization, which is those same younger folks. It's like baseball. You always have to keep a watchful eye on your farm system, those seasoned pros who are 30 are not going to be around forever."
chicago,3disib,R_TOKAR,2,Fri Jul 17 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed you need a mix. Those new faces also bring new ideas of how to work as well as newer business school education.    The whole thing is really complex especially when you throw in the human-element that isn't business oriented. Single mothers get a LOT of leeway in performance and so do those older people. Why? Because we're human and we're not firing someone who's already struggling and trying to raise a child. We're also not firing Jeb who's been here fuggin forever and is a total sweetheart, even though he naps here and there.    I feel like a lot of ""business working"" knowledge people have is from 80s movies or movies based on the 80s. That cutthroat, jerk boss and management team who's only concerned about profit. They're walking all over those below them and constantly scheming ways to squeeze people. Maybe I'm just lucky but I've never seen that happen nor have I read about it any of my books.

I was an ops manager at a firm and there was this shady ass manager who'd constantly throw people under the bus like with no shame. He wasn't in the department I ran so luckily I had nothing to do with him. But the shady shit he did was epic. He actually CCd a recruiter I knew who I was cool with on an email to another company saying ""Hey so and so is looking for work and I recommend him...""   He was still employed there. It was his way of trying to get rid of him. My friend got hired personally by a VP, and emailed the VP like ""hey uh, wtf is this all about?"" and the VP stepped in and put him on another team.

chicago,3disib,midwaygardens,4,Fri Jul 17 22:50:41 2015 UTC,Not true at all. Sears has a dedicated pace bus that picks up at the Rosemont blue line stop as do many other companies.  When I was there there were a bunch of south side employees.   Sears moved to the burbs for space.  The inventory teams needed a ton of design and model layout space at the time which is something you don't get in a high rise.  They have a model store in the basement of one of their buildings out there and a huge corporate conference center.  They also at the time could put all of their subsidiaries under one roof

Once crime came back down to pre-1970 levels (last year we were on par with 1965), the whole ""urban renewal"" phase happened.  Detroit was hit hardest by this too no? The race riots caused massive economic damage, followed by the gas crisis in the 70s and the decline of the American car proved fatal. Their entire economy was based on the production of cars.  That is why when people say ""Chicago is the next Detroit!"" I tend to laugh because:  1) Our economy is exceedingly diverse and no where near based upon one industry and  2) Crime is still falling in general but we also don't have the riots they did  Dunno, could be wrong."

Its just a place and I'm not personally attacking you.  No need to get hurt feelings. You city folk are so sensitive (kidding)! What I'm really interested in is the other questions. Don't you long for nature, room for outdoor activities, and a place to build stuff? I doubt most people have room to build a table, set up a garden, or have a workshop. I know a lot of people do it but owning a dog would be a pain in the ass too."
chicago,3disib,Ekkus,7,Thu Jul 16 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, all that stuff is half-assed. I mean no matter how big my yard is, it feels like a back yard, not nature. If I want nature, I'll go out to Michigan or Colorado on vacation. I'd rather go to the park for regular outdoor activities. Gardening sounds like something I'd do when I'm 70, not 25. A workshop would be nice but is it really worth passing up on all the convenience of the city? I mean I need space to work once every 3 months.   All those activities are so solitary. Maybe you have one or two people doing it with you, or your kids. I hate that solitude and would much rather be in the city, in close proximity to other people and friends, activities, and events. You can interact with people on the street, meet new people, even if it's brief conversations, rather than yelling at shitty drivers or asking a store clerk how to find something (90% of suburban interaction with strangers).  It's nice to be able to get anywhere with public transportation and at worst, a cheap taxi/Lyft ride. I love that I don't have to drive everywhere I go and I love how much I get to walk to get where I'm going. I love that I can bike to work sometimes, it's a great way to wake up! All of the fun social things you can do are simply closer and easier to get to and those things are way more fun than having a yard, garden, workshop, and ""peace.""   Overall, I'd say this is the typical mindset of the people my age around me. I have nothing against your lifestyle, but to me it sounds just like a slow death. Like others in this thread, unless I was desperate, I would not accept a job in the suburbs and would do everything I could to not move back out there."

chicago,3dlqax,mattfromchicago,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"My thought is that a single Divvy ride pegged to the cost of a single CTA ride would be a great option.  An annual membership is still a sunk cost if I don't use that often... maybe I'd only use it 3 or 4 times a year, when it's perfect out and I feel inspired to ride home. Maybe somebody is in town for a weekend and needs it one time to get from, say the Zoo to Navy Pier. There is a huge difference between sinking a big chunk of money into something I might then use at some future point and here's $2 for something I want to do right now."
chicago,3dlqax,blipsman,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:14 2015 UTC,The annual membership is such an insanely good deal I don't see this as being an issue. I own a bike and I still end up divvying multiple times per week.  Just shell out the $75 and be happy.
chicago,3dlqax,thelapoubelle,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"Divvy is such a great idea but has several, what I consider to be, flaws.  A 30 minute check-in time is just too short...I know this is supposed to be a commuter tool and not a ""tourist"" tool, but damn, that barely gives you enough time to get from A to B.  Secondly, upping your price to $9.95 is a good way to make sure you lose a lot of one-time traffic.  $7 was already a bit steep considering most people only use it for a couple hours and then give up because they're annoying having to check it in so often.  Maybe it's just me, but if Divvy offered something along the lines of...$3 for 3 hours kind of deal, I think they would get much utilization."
chicago,3dlqax,neverstandstill,2,Fri Jul 17 18:27:19 2015 UTC,If you're close to 30 min just dock it and immediately check it out again. If not its only 2 dollars anyway.

Alternative to multiple coat weights you'll learn about layering that might allow you to sneak by with owing just two weights of winter coat.  And hats and options for you hands.  And the choice between two thin socks vrs one thick one.

chicago,3di22x,theramennoodle,8,Thu Jul 16 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"Rent is expensive compared to a mid-sized city or small town. However you can justify the higher rent because you are essentially paying for the amenities the city provides. If you are smart about it and forego owning a car (which you don't need living in the city) for example you can save around 3k+ just in car payments, insurance,gas and maintenance and that does not count parking, which is ridiculous if you live in any of the denser neighborhoods. That makes up for the difference in rent and monthly CTA costs.   Also if you compare it to other large developed metros like LA,SF,SD,DC,Seattle,Boston and NYC living in Chicago is a steal. You get big city amenities and lifestyle for about 30% less."
chicago,3di22x,trojan_man16,11,Thu Jul 16 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"I moved to Seattle in November. Compared to Chicago, this place is outrageously expensive and I don't just mean the rent, which is much higher than what you read online. A lot of the stats include apartments not actually being currently rented (i.e. someone who's been renting a place for a decade with minimal rent increases gets averaged in). Food here, at the grocery store and in restaurants is way more expensive and the food at restaurants mainly only varies by texture, since everything tastes about the same; spices and seasoning don't make it this far to the northwest. Don't get me started on the public transit. The Seattle Art Museum is almost as expensive as the Art Institute and though I don't have exact measurements, I'd guess it's about 1/20th the size. Seriously, if you want to live in a real big city and don't mind the winters, Chicago is the best deal in the US."
chicago,3di22x,sudojay,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"Just moved to seattle recently as well and it's blowing my mind how expensive it actually is (I'd been warned for years beforehand that cost of living was high, but still decided to give it a try).   I pay well over the 30% mark of my income for a large studio/small 1BDR (these crazy ""open one-bedrooms"") in the far reaches of the city.  But beyond that, the grocery cost is as you said slightly high (the cost of butter is striking me as off, and I need to remind myself to look up prices elsewhere).  What's killing me though (and this is 1st world problem shit) is the liquor taxes!  20% wat!? I lived in PA for the last 5 years, where liquor is state controlled, and I'm still seeing prices in WA as 10%ish higher bottom-line."

It all depends on what is ""affordable"" to you. For reference, three friends currently live off Clark/Diversey (Lincoln Park) in a 3br/1ba for $600/guy. Hell, I live in Old Town and my rent is $420/mo. Granted I split a 2br/1ba with an office (turned into an additional br), but it works and the three of us love it there. Especially if you're constantly busy like myself, don't overpay for a bedroom. At the end of the day, it's simply a place for me to sleep.  If I'm paying that in Old Town, you can find that anywhere within reasonable distance outside of the loop area.  Roommates are the key. If you want to live on your own, I wish you the best of luck because that is exactly why this article has the ""stats"" to write this. People that want to live on their own pay for it, those with roommates spend hundreds, and I mean hundreds less per month.  One last thing... Just about any reasonable neighborhood's safety is equivalent to your own fear of it not being safe. One thing that'll separate you from a lot of pretentious people here is that people tend to create excuses (like safety) to justify their borderline retarded reasoning to overpay for a place they can barely afford. I have a friend and his girlfriend that pay $1,600/mo. for a high rise in River North, and I guarantee they are struggling. My point, don't overpay because you're too proud. All neighborhoods have pros/cons, but all neighborhoods are as nice as you perceive it to be.  I love this city.

Since 2012 I've watched about 24 new luxury highrises dump, on average, 300 new units per building onto the market (~7000 new units).

Only 1 block from the Red Line. And they were cool with me having a 120lb Great Dane. I did come home once to find a broken window and a bullet hole in my ceiling, but other than that, it was a dream. It turned out to be too good to be true, though. I had to move when my landlord defaulted on his mortgage and fled the country.   Over near Wilson was still pretty rough then, and I couldn't find anything at Lawrence that allowed my dog or didn't cost a fortune, so I ended up moving two Red Line stops north and paying the same price to rent a smaller 2 bed/1 bath, 300 sqft smaller that ended up being the worst apartment I have ever rented in my life. Unhinged, elderly slumlord landlord, scary plumbing and electrical work in the building done by unqualified handymen or herself, water/power/heat issues constantly, massively overstated and outright lied about amenities. Also, totally unsafe area. Two massive, gang related shootouts/multiple homicides occurred on my block during my last 3 months there, once while I was out on the street walking my dog.

Chicago is still cheaper than most major cities, but less so with each year, and not much cheaper if you want to live in a decent neighborhood close to public transport or near the city center.  I've had to keep moving further out every year, and the three times I've moved since 2010 the rents were jacked up hundreds of dollars.  1 bed in Wicker Park was $1,075 - now $1,500+; 3 bed duplex in Bucktown was $2,175 (I think), raised to $2,500; 2 bed condo in Logan Square was $1,700 and increased to $1,950.

I got one cut in at Mike's new shop for $25 but he said the next one would be $50 - I tried out the guys over at Metropolitan Barber Shop  (56 W VanBuren) and got their most junior guy (I was able to book online though, and really took whatever I could get because I was in dire need of a cut) and he did an ok job. I think if I were to go back to Metropolitan, I'd get one of the more senior guys (Christian or Mario).   I think next month I'll check out the place in the Civic Opera shop.

When taking I-90 toward Chicago, there is a sudden unsigned right lane merge immediately following the I-Pass electronic express lanes. A merge sign is needed.   After that I-Pass there are several situations where a far right lane is created by an on ramp only to disappear without warning. This wouldn't be so terrible, but the exit signs will say, ""Austin Next Exit, Right."" Drivers immediately go into the on ramp, realize the ramp ends in 200 feet and then fight to get over. The lane best suited for the posted exit should be marked specifically to prevent this issue.  Street parking zones on major streets should have posted warning signs like ""Right lane ends after Higgins, public parking ahead."" At this stage, we constantly have people merging after the intersection causing gridlock.  Crossing the median to turn left from a corner store or gas station between the hours of 5am and midnight should be fined harshly and enforced. Lots of gridlock is ""let me through... Oh there is traffic. I will just wait blocking all lanes on the right side of the road in the meantime.""

chicago,3disy2,MargretTatchersParty,5,Thu Jul 16 20:37:59 2015 UTC,All of the non-rural highways that are still stuck at 55 but the 80% speed of drivers when not rush hour is 65 or 70.
chicago,3disy2,598X0T45,-3,Thu Jul 16 22:13:57 2015 UTC,the ones inside the city limit should stay where they are. outside the city limits they might do well to go up to 60 or 65.
chicago,3disy2,MargretTatchersParty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:10 2015 UTC,"Well, the argument that the traffic engineers have put forward is that a 55 speed limit is too low for most drivers to obey but 5-10 percent of drivers will obey it - creating 10-15 mph speed differentials. Just to be clear - 70 mph is not more dangerous, but when most people drive 70 and some drive 55 that IS dangerous."

[Btw ATL is a shitty example of public transit]  Besides, want to use public transit so you don't have to drive to go drink? You're good to do that in Chicago if you live near the blue line or the red line. In CLT or ATL ... nope.   Besides ... Chicago has been working on improvements to the purple line, the redline, blue line, adding BRT, and has been replacing rail cars.

chicago,3disy2,aesthetic-as-fuck,5,Thu Jul 16 20:52:37 2015 UTC,"Actually this does surprise me a lot, to the extent that I doubt the methodology of WalletHub's study.  Uber has repeatedly blogged that Chicago is amongst the cheapest cities in the country for their service. Lots of people in Chicago are willing to drive for Uber for relatively little money, so rates here are amongst the cheapest. Although gas prices are high here, gas is only a portion of overall driving costs. Vehicle registration, parking costs, and insurance costs are relatively cheap in Chicago compared to other major cities, and being relative compact compared to other American cities people in Chicago generally don't have to travel as many miles to get to typical destinations as they would in other cities. So even if traffic is moving slowly, at least the typical person on their typical trip isn't sitting in it for as many minutes.  I agree that some of the parking and traffic tickets and penalties in Chicago are gratuitous excessive cash grabs, but in theory you can avoid those most of the time. The actual fees for vehicle registration and zone parking stickers in Chicago is, I think, very cheap, possibly too cheap. The city also does a relatively good job of keeping the streets clean and clear of snow. Many other US cities even in the North are completely shut down for days after modest snowfalls, Chicago rarely bats an eye. I don't know whether they do this work efficiently or economically, I just know they get it done."
chicago,3disy2,deadmandrawing,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"People drive for cheap in Uber Chicago because wages here are so small compared to other regions, and there's a LOT of very poor people who make very little. I noticed the wages for a lot of jobs here are pretty weak compared to elsewhere in the nation.  They're also tied to the taxi rates, which are also lower here than elsewhere. If they were any higher, people wouldn't use them."
chicago,3disy2,StarBarbershop,2,Thu Jul 16 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"If they were any higher, people wouldn't use them.   I drive for Uber, and when it's 2.5x people are still taking the ride.  Shit's way underpriced."
chicago,3disy2,bicameral_mind,3,Thu Jul 16 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"If they raised their regular rates 2.5x and the taxis stood pat, Uber would lose all that business.  When they have the surge on, taxis are so scarce that expensive Uber is still worth it. But only then."
chicago,3disy2,bradatlarge,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:08 2015 UTC,It's normally like half or 60% the price of a cab and it's across the board superior.

chicago,3disy2,TheRealJeribro,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely not across the board superior. Uber drivers only know how to follow Google maps and maybe find major intersections. If you need to get somewhere as quickly as possible, a cab will do it way better than an uber."

While there are plenty of noob Uber drivers, simply demanding they use Waze or that you direct them where to go is a viable option.

Even though I plan to stay in Chicago for a while, one of the main reasons I haven't bought a place yet is because I haven't settled professionally and know I'll be working another job in a year, and probably another 2-3 years after that.  You can easily sink another 30 minutes to an hour with your commute based on seemingly minor geographic changes in residence or employment.  I don't want to buy a place that's convenient now but then I end up regretting it because in year my new job is an extra 45 minutes away."

chicago,3disy2,deadmandrawing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:52 2015 UTC,Maybe because we have the largest network of red light and speeding cameras......and the shortest yellow light of any major city in the nation.......
chicago,3disy2,SoulSerpent,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:53:11 2015 UTC,"While, not the best operational plan, the yellow light times are legal, I wish they would increase it to the recommended safety number for 30 mph (3.5 seconds) personally. I do not agree with people who say the city should raise it to the 40mph timing (3.7? seconds). I believe one of the biggest problems contributing to speeding and dangerous driving is the consistent over-engineering of roads so that speeding is OK. In more contemporary roads planning, its been pretty well established that designing a road to be safe at the speed limit tends to make people go the speed limit - people drive the speed they feel safe at, not the artificially placed speed limit on a high-speed designed roadway.   At the same time, changing the yellow timing to 3.5 seconds would probably cause epic gridlock, to be honest. lengthening each light cycle .5 seconds will compound pretty disastrously over the course of a day. (even so I wish they'd do it - might also shift a few people over to transit and get them off the roads, hopefully the most impatient, and shittiest drivers of the bunch"
chicago,3disy2,ggslovin,0,Fri Jul 17 05:14:22 2015 UTC,"Not saying people should drive however they want to. If that's the case you will be looking at those x days traffic jams seen in some Asian countries.  Also not saying people should drive aggressively, or recklessly.  However people, should, use common sense. For example: Oh maybe I should get off the passing lane and NOT drive side by side on this x lane road with this/these x-1 folk(s) driving parallel with me,  Or: Hummmm there is this big ass chunk of open road ahead of me, but why are there so much traffic behind me eh? (Those of you who take 90 and pass ORD should know)  Or: Something is in my way... But I forgot how to use my steering wheel... So I won't go around, and I'll just wait here, I also forgot how to move up  a little so others behind me could get around, so those guys are SOL.  These are just a small sample. Of course to completely eliminate stupidity is only going to be wishful thinking of mankind, thus we all have to wait patiently or impatiently as their precious or not-so-precious life washes away with every revolution of their idling engine that's barely transferring its potential filled torque (as seen in commercials) into the transmission."

They get searched 3x before they enter the cell, and we check our cells every 30 minutes.   Get arrested, lose all your clothes down to one layer. Yes, it sucks, but policies exist exactly for this reason. I can't imagine a facility that doesn't have these policies, and if they don't, they should have enacted them.   I can't speak to the arrest itself, but in terms of the suicide, depending on what the implement was for the noose, I foresee a lawsuit.   But, as always, let's see where the facts lead, hmm?"

So, if 51,625 officers were truly assaulted out of the 520,047 (FBI 2013) sworn, that gives us a rate of 10 officers assaulted for every 100, and of those 10, only 3 will sustain injuries (14,857 injuries FBI 2013).  3 out of 100 officers will be injured.

The standard for conviction is beyond a reasonable doubt.   The start off not requiring much, to requiring a lot of evidence.   For example, Terry Stops come from a case where a man was walking up and down a street cupping his hands to store fronts and looking inside. The officer in question knew through experience said it looked like they were casing stores to rob. so he stopped the man to investigate, frisked him, he found a gun and tools burglars typically use.   Now, nothing the guy did that led to the stop was illegal. The only thing that was illegal was the gun and of course he obviously intended to commit burglary. But the cop didn't know he had the gun and the tools.   But the stop was legal because of his prior actions. Now, if the guy didn't have guns or tools, the stop still would have been legal. But the cop couldn't arrest him, but if the guy resisted the detainment, he would still be resisting arrest because the investigative stop was lawful."

Why are people upvoting you for not only posting a pointless post, but being way fucking wrong about your assumption?  http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/resource_jails_prisons.pdf   Pre-trial inmates who commit suicide in custody are generally male, young (20-25 years), unmarried, and first time offenders who have been arrested for minor, usually substance related, offences. They are typically intoxicated at the time of their arrest and commit suicide at an early stage of their confinement,16 often within the first few hours (because of sudden isolation, shock of imprisonment, lack of information, insecurity about the future). Individual establishments can reduce their suicide risk by paying attention to reception and first night procedures, induction processes, and levels of care for prisoners. A second period of risk for pre-trial inmates is near the time of a court appearance, especially when a guilty verdict and harsh sentencing may be anticipated. A great deal of all jail suicides occurred within three days of a court appearance.  Although the vast majority of suicides that occur in correctional settings are committed by men (because the vast majority of inmates are men), women in custody are also at high risk of suicide.4  Female pre-trial inmates attempt suicide much more often than their female counterparts in the community4,24 and as their incarcerated male counterparts. Also the rates for completed suicides of women seem to be higher than those of men.25 They also have high rates of serious mental illness.26 While more specific risk profiles of pre-trial and sentenced women are still lacking, women having poor social and family supports, prior suicidal behaviour, a  Page 8 history of psychiatric illness and emotional problems should be targeted for suicide prevention programmes."

Freddie Gray.. there is a CLEAR problem with many cops and black people.  i just dont get this line of logical thinking where because some people have been abused by cops (or.. you know.. people.. people abuse eachother all the time.. the domestic violence numbers speak clearly. and they arent cops) it means every instance is abuse by police.  I actually care about the problem of Police Brutality and racism, but I really feel like people trivialize the truth and facts of the case to fit their narrative.  I will gladly admit if this is proven a murder, but YOU DON'T START WITH a large conspiracy to murder someone and cover it up.. especially when there is a clear history of suicide in jail, and people being PUSHED to their last breaking point.  I've attempted suicide myself.   It's not surprising why people make quick irrational emotional decisions.  MY WHOLE POINT, is that i support the fight against police brutality, but I also think its important not to trivialize every interaction with police as some intentional killing.   I am the last person to want to defend cops.  I have so many problems with them. i've had a history of them.. but when i start projecting MY history on to cops that have nothing to do with me, than i am making a huge mistake.  I'm messing up the effectiveness of my cause and diluting its message by just ASSUMING the worst every time.  there is a problem of black people being chased down and shot, etc..  the best way to deal with that issue is to be factual and not use broad generalizations for every instance.    If this comes out to be a suicide as it has been said, you will still have people saying it was a cover up, etc.. There is really no way to have a rational discussion with people who dont appreciate rationality.  the way racists talk about black people, sounds an awful lot like how activists talk about white people.  its just two sides of a nasty coin.  i wish people would learn to have disucssiosn and WANT TO convince their opponent through reason and logic.  I dont know why shaming is supposed to be considered an effective method of progress.  Do you want to hurt and shame the people you disagree with, or do you want to educate them?

I think this will be more of a kickoff for Bernie supporters to meet up and discuss how/what we can do to help the campaign. It might be more casual then then the big rallies we will hopefully see in the future.   This meet-up event will be open to the public and is a great chance for supporters of Bernie Sanders, especially young voters, to come together to show their support for the campaign. This is a great opportunity to meet other Sanders enthusiasts, discuss the issues, and coordinate ways to further spread the message about Sanders 2016."

If this kind of stuff is deemed acceptable, then what's going to stop people from turning this into a political campaigning sub? Every meeting, no matter how small or unimportant is fair game for being posted here. Will you still agree with things like this being relevant if somebody decides to go and post every single meeting and rally here for somebody like Jeb Bush or for a local church's services? If they think it's relevant to a Chicago sub, then that means it's ok right?"
chicago,3djoqt,Kumdogmillionaire,0,Thu Jul 16 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. If someone was posting about a specific event, Jeb Bush or otherwise (WTF does that matter?) I think that's okay. You don't. That's cool. But I stand by my post."

Go up to the bar at the top of the Hancock Tower.  Grab a beer and you'll have more views that you'll know what to do with.  The rooftop bar at W, as well as the Wit are also good for photos.  If you have a few $$, you could always grab a meal at the Mid America Club at the top of the Aon center.  Good food there.  The best bet for good photos, is along the lake, however.  Go near the aquarium and you'll get some spectacular skyline photos.  The pier at North Ave beach is also excellent for this, as well."

chicago,3dj30k,professorpan,7,Fri Jul 17 19:50:48 2015 UTC,Well we're still in transitioning period and /u/beam1985 is taking time to sort all this out instead of haphazardly installing a new replacement top mod.
chicago,3dj30k,the_koob,3,Thu Jul 16 20:37:07 2015 UTC,installing a new replacement top mod.   Isn't illuminatedwax still the top mod?
chicago,3dj30k,the_koob,10,Thu Jul 16 18:15:11 2015 UTC,He refuses to give up his perch. Only pokes his head in once a month to do literally nothing and then disappear again. The re-org was going just fine. And then IlluminatedWax came in and threw a wrench in the gears. Told beam that he was basically king and was going to reinstate mods etc etc.  Dude just needs to fucking go already.
chicago,3dj30k,beam1985,3,Thu Jul 16 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"I know.  Was just expanding that once beam finds a replacement, we aren't exactly in the clear as we don't technically have a new 'top mod'"
chicago,3dj30k,professorpan,4,Thu Jul 16 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wax wanted to reinstate all the old mods. I don't agree with that. Beam wants to find replacements and then step down. Wax should just give it up period."
chicago,3dj30k,professorpan,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:56 2015 UTC,Oh yeah that's the top-top mod

But I havent seen anything from /u/beam1985 in the last week in regards to getting this sub into a better shape. His stupid little survey suggested we have voting back on July 8th, 9th or 10th. That was a week ago.   I think the general populous would be ok with waiting - if there was some sort of action plan or some decisive plan - but there really isn't. /u/beam1985 continues to say ""everything is on the table"" and he's ""open to suggestions on how to improve"" and I feel like there have been TONS of suggestions on how to move forward and a complete lack of momentum on his part.   I understand people have jobs and lives and families and I don't expect him to drop everything to cater to the needs of a 70,000 subscribed user base. But it's simply unfair to new visitors, people looking to come to our city, and the hard working contributors such as yourself, /u/_Guinness, /u/MrDowntown (and many many others) to let us continue to sit in this 'limbo' (transitioning period).   Your thoughts?"

Honestly I haven't followed what's happened since that particular post.   I tend to have a ""wait and see"" attitude, but yeah I'll probably be more impatient if nothing's being done by the end of this week, along with many others."

chicago,3dj30k,R_TOKAR,9,Thu Jul 16 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Honest question, can't people just ignore and/or downvote racist people? Why does it have to be someone else's responsibility (unpaid) to address trolls? That seems like a tall hurdle.  People who post racist stuff should be ignored just like they are in real life."
chicago,3dj30k,honestbleeps,4,Thu Jul 16 18:20:34 2015 UTC,"they can, but the downvote trolls often just take that as a cue to do even more shitposting and it just gets worse and worse.  when I was a mod, I wasn't removing that shit to protect people's feelings, I was removing it because the more the sub gets flooded with that sort of shit, the less people with anything positive actually participate.  it ends up just being shitposts and people succumbing to the trollbait of the shitposts - so you have a huge comment thread of shitposts + arguing, and nothing insightful/interesting/good because people see all that shit and just ""nope right outta there"".  if you want a good community, it's most effective to try and nudge it that way.  I'm not suggesting, btw, that this place was a world away in terms of being different when I was a mod. I wasn't able to be on 24/7 constantly removing stuff. I just did get to what I could when I could.  I can't say the same for every other mod (but some of them I can)."

chicago,3dj30k,deadmandrawing,4,Thu Jul 16 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"frankly you should only have to hit report - from a website user perspective - but that relies on moderators remembering to view the modqueue and it's just not an easy habit to develop. Otherwise they only see reported comments when clicking into that thread (and moderators can't realistically be expected to keep coming back repeatedly to every comment thread).  Basically, the mod tools suck, so a modmail saying ""I reported X"" helps grease the wheels."

Also he's been incredibly instrumental in finding venues for the larger meetups. (Venues are a freaking pain in the ass for groups) /u/HonestBleeps - He's been instrumental in the high level/macro going ons. (I.e. automod) /u/BenedictKenny - He's been pretty good about general modship.

(He was active in the couchsurfing community)     New people I'd like to see:   /u/guinness : I think he has a bit of potential in calendar related stuff and working with the Wiki (May have a few ideas about weekly posts etc) [Also he had a lot of suggestions in a previous post] /u/ProfessorPan : This guy has been arround and has been incredibly helpful to  visitors.

The non-helmeted cyclists in the study were more likely to have a skull fracture, but not any more likely to have intra-cranial hemorrhage than cyclists who crashed while wearing a helmet.

chicago,3dn12w,thelapoubelle,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think the CTA is capable of coordinating a conspiracy like that, even if they thought it's a good idea to make customers late.  More than likely, there's some minor work going on.  Those tracks are old as shit, and need constant attention.  Or they redid the schedule after they cancelled the purple line thing."
chicago,3dn12w,planification,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:09 2015 UTC,Never attribute to conspiracy what can be instead attributed to the inherent problems of an under-funded public system running on 100 year old infrastructure

They needed specific details like exactly what time I had a ride (idfk- 130am?) but because I paid with credit card they could search the exact driver and car I had been in. It took nine days of me calling 3x/ day and the company suspending the drivers permit for him to finally turn them in.

All of the artists at Brown Brothers do some awesome coloring but they are more traditional style place. The artists at Family are pretty decent too. Deluxe probably has the most diverse artists so I'd check them out too. There are a ton of good shops all over the city but these are just the places either I or a friend have been to.

chicago,3dksvw,professorpan,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, ""explain to me like I'm 5"" something as complicated as municipal finances and pensions?  We were supposed to be saving money to give to people when they retire.  We didn't keep up our end of the bargain and now we don't have enough money to fulfill the promises we made."
chicago,3dksvw,mattfromchicago,2,Fri Jul 17 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"There are assumptions that go into that figure, such as interest rates, returns on investments, and how long retirees live.  $9 billion is an educated guess.  But it is bad, and part of how it got bad was that the city has been allowed pension holidays, where less than what we need gets paid in under the premise that we'll do better next year.  We haven't been doing well enough yet.    What's keeping us from being Detroit?  Well, for one thing, much of Detroit was destroyed in race riots.  We may be looking at higher taxes, but we're not looking at perfectly good houses being destroyed.  And while Chicago is losing population, it's increasing in household earnings.  In other words, the people moving here have more money than the people leaving.  There definitely some neighborhoods where you see this vacancy.  But the city is very stringent with regulations on vacant houses, and actively takes property from absentee owners to keep the rest of the block safe.  And our largest employers are diversified.  Some are industrial, some are in aviation, food manufacturing, business services, and banking.  Sears, for instance, used to be a large employer downtown, and moved to the suburbs 20 years ago.   We've been fine.  We're diversified enough to deal.    And since the State can't constitutionally reduce pensions, the other  options are increasing taxes, reducing government services, or waiting for this to blow over.  The end solution will be some combination of the three.  It's a big problem, but is altogether different than what happened to Detroit."
chicago,3dksvw,planification,2,Fri Jul 17 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not a finance officer, or anything close. But what I discuss with my more liberal leaning (I don't know how to define myself, liberal fiscal conservative?) is that in a nutshell, we love to spend, and it's biting us in the ass.   What's the rule everyone is taught and few people follow? Don't spend money you don't have. Don't rely on credit or assume you'll be fine down the road. That is exactly what's been happening for decades in Chicago and Illinois.   Political machine needs votes, drums up programs that are all expenditure based. We as citizens don't demand that our budget be balanced. By that I mean we don't blink an eye when every year the powers that be pass an illegal budget. Why? We like stuff. Who cares if we are going into massive debt?! STUFF, GUYS, STUFF!  That's how we end up here. People get pissed about the tax hike, well dumbass, demand spending in line with revenue. But that means less stuff. Now we are at a point where we have people pissed that we are losing programs, but those programs never should have been started or grown to their current levels in the first place.   As a union member I'll say we are also to blame. Blunt refusals to accept a smaller package in favor of the larger good, especially back in the 90's, is fucking pensioners now.   TL:DR - ""I'm gonna get mine"" got us this."

It seems to me that the voting class spent decades voting in and retaining people who kept the programs going and weren't honest and forthright - ""I'm sorry, we can't afford ____"" doesn't win votes.   But now we are bitching because we kept people who told us what we wanted to hear, not what we needed to hear.   Illinois has a TON of problems, corruption at every level. But we seem content with it so long as we keep getting ours. But it's all gotta fall sometime."

(I was crossing at a stop sign where the cab had stopped - he then chose to go with me still in front of him (not paying attention?)
