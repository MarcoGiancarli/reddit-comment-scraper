Watercolor,3e5kpn,Reapernix,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"If you don't want the outline to bleed, do them last, or use a waterproof ink. (Make sure the ink says ""waterproof"" and not ""water resistant"").  Also I find that an easy way to shade is to load up the edges/shadowed areas with color and pull it towards the highlight with just water or suuuuper diluted paint. Have fun!"
Watercolor,3e0toa,graar1996,4,Tue Jul 21 02:14:04 2015 UTC,A basic approach to making darks without the use of black is to mix burnt sienna with ultramarine blue.

Watercolor,3dvce4,Anotherelephant,2,Mon Jul 20 01:52:09 2015 UTC,Here's a picture with better lighting. I didn't realize how dark this one was =/
Watercolor,3dwg2e,graar1996,3,Mon Jul 20 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"For critique of this I'd suggest doing some sketching first.  Faces are about proportions. Going off a picture, sure you can just hope to copy it as best as possible, but you have a good picture here to start learning how to make good initial drawings before putting down the water and paint. For example this photo is great for learning positive and negative space. Also when I draw first I'm drawing down the shapes and areas I know will be painted in...hmm it's hard to explain.   In any case I'd practice drawing this first and knowing that your dark areas are going to be pools of paint and your light areas of white.  Also I wouldn't paint with black. I'd mix my own black and let it fall apart as it hit the paper. You want to make a painting, not just be a copy machine....right? ;p"
Watercolor,3dwg2e,girlhassocks,3,Mon Jul 20 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"Well I think you did fantastic. My advice is also a question. Did you have fun? If answer is yes, we'll keep doing what you love! If no... have fun and see the answer to yes. That's what art is about. Having fun, capturing feelings and moments. When we lose sight of those things we criticize ourselves and others."
Watercolor,3dwg2e,amtheref,2,Mon Jul 20 06:16:26 2015 UTC,Might want to use paper...this looks like it was done on canvas style paper....
Watercolor,3dwg2e,girlhassocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:09 2015 UTC,It was done on acrylic paper. It was the only heavy paper they had that was bound in the way that I like. Previous paper I had used was not working because the paper was getting too wet. Can you explain to me what the difference would be?
Watercolor,3dwg2e,girlhassocks,2,Mon Jul 20 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"Well if the paper you were using was getting too weight then it was probably too thin.  The difference is that paper is porous. The water and the paint will seep into the paper. Acrylic gesso canvas the watercolor paint won't really do that. Now there are canvas style watercolor things out there.  If the art store you live near doesn't have a heavy weight or cold press paper then order online. I'd suggest even getting a watercolor paper sketchbook or pad to start off with, then expensive paper. Although an Arches watercolor block would be a good start too.  If you find the paper getting too watery you may need to slow yourself down. I'm not sure any of this is helpful or exactly what experience u have anyway."
Watercolor,3du9r9,MoldyCat,4,Sun Jul 19 15:14:39 2015 UTC,"I like your style! Colors are great. My only cc would be to maybe make the shadows around the eyes a little darker; both to create contrast and because those areas pale a little in comparison to everything else. Regardless, awesome work!"

Watercolor,3dtjdg,DankAndDangerous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I use a thicker ballpoint pen to outline most of my lines which is about what I do different than most people rather than soften my lines. I'm not usually going for a realistic look anyways so the lines really make things come to the foreground."
Watercolor,3dsnan,Hella_Norcal,7,Sun Jul 19 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"That looks pretty good!  Moving forward I'd say start painting things with stronger lighting.  This will help you make portraits that have more depth since you can work with a higher range of values.    As for hair, the hard thing with hair is people tend to want to draw individual strands.  But when you study it closely, you'll realise similarly to any form, it's a series of shapes and planes.  Take a look at this close up of a Vermeer.  You'll notice that he is not painting strands/lines, he is painting the shapes the hair forms and each shape has a different colour/value that is informed by his light source and that is what gives the hair realism and depth. In your painting, it looks like your light is coming from the right, but your hair is not darker on the left side of your head (which you can think of as cylindrical) when it should be, as the light is not hitting it directly.  Not to say that you can't and shouldn't paint strands, but those details should come after you have your basic values down.   Hope that helps!"

She's been in a drab work environment for a long time so I hope this livens it up a little. My plan is to find a nice frame at a yard sale tomorrow and have it matted and framed by Monday.

Watercolor,3drd93,ANTELOGI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:56:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That's what I ended up ordering, only I went for the half pan set instead of the tubes. Any suggestions for what to look for in a good set of brushes?"
Watercolor,3drd93,ANTELOGI,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've found that those cheap synthetic brushes that often come in sets work just as fine as most expensive animal hair brushes.  I actually prefer them.  But that might just be me.  But as you're just starting, it might be a good idea to start with those to build your skill in comfort in the medium, and as time goes on whenever you have extra money go ahead and splurge and explore what different brushes have to offer and you'll discover for yourself what you like best.  Just make sure to get the synthetics that are for acrylic or watercolour and look soft.  Not the thicker bristle brushes."
Watercolor,3drd93,ANTELOGI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:11:39 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the insight! I really appreciate it and can't wait to get started :)

Watercolor,3drd93,Orangebird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:59 2015 UTC,I really like the Princeton 4050 brushes. I have a round 1 and round 3 and mostly paint on small 3x4 or 6x8 fluid blocks which are nice because you can avoid taping your paper down. You'd want bigger brushes depending on what size paper you're using.  For paints I have the Winsor Newton Field set which is nice. The pan sets are nice because they're a little more travel friendly if you want to paint outside.  I'm still a beginner but I found that brushes are pretty important for me if you find yourself fighting the brush you have you should find something else.

Watercolor,3dpewo,Apple_Jacked,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:22:33 2015 UTC,"I really like your clouds in the second one. You did a nice job of giving them shape and texture using light and dark washes.  I think you have just started to do that with the foreground/greenery, but could do more. I am particularly referring to the right middle, where you can see the lighter green peaking out from under the darker green. In comparison, the left side looks much more flat. Does that make sense?  Hope this helps!"
Watercolor,3dpewo,cricketlickit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:59 2015 UTC,More water!  It looks like you're using the paint pretty thickly and are missing out on the wonderful life watercolour can have when it has freedom to move through your paper.  See this for an example of a very watered down landscape.
Watercolor,3dpewo,ANTELOGI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"So watercolor paint isn't like acrylics or oils, which you probably know. But this looks like you tried to put in the colors like they were going to standout on top of each other.   I'd go back and start doing test washes and play with the medium more. Make a small pool of water on the paper (not too flooded...just a thin layer) and then take some saturated paint (heavy in paint on the brush ) and let bleed into the wetted area. Then let it dry! Watercolor is mostly water and color, reacting together on paper. The paper will absorb and resist the pigments which is amazing."

Watercolor,3dennb,humminbirdtunes,3,Wed Jul 15 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Check out this photo.  You can see how the flash creates highlights on the surfaces of the cat's face aimed at the camera. Make sure to think about your light source and include those types of highlights. Your painting has no light source, thus no sense of the cat's body being 3 dimensional.  Also, make sure not to lose your lighter colors. Torties usually have some light grey and light orange markings as well as rich orange, dark drown and dark grey/black. They also tend to have strikingly lopsided markings, like this one. Try to emphasize the markings so they show up clearly to someone looking at the painting.  Hope this helps!"

Watercolor,3d1wjp,mrnmrsp,19,Sun Jul 12 21:20:43 2015 UTC,"My high school art teacher used to always say ""Push your darks"". Basically, go over the top with your shading and push how dark the darkest color in your piece is, beyond what you think is necessary.  The extra shading will likely help you achieve more of a 3-D feel to the work.  Another suggestion is to limit how much you utilize photos as source material. They are inherently flat and using them means that you are likely going to end up with a flat looking finished project. If you have the space, do a few still lifes as practice. Set up some intense lighting so you get some really strong chiaroscuro, which should also help you work on getting a better tonal range.  Good luck!"

Watercolor,3d1wjp,angelxox,11,Mon Jul 13 05:14:58 2015 UTC,Take a picture of these and change it to grayscale. You will see how little contrast you have going on. More contrast makes more depth.
Watercolor,3d1wjp,thyfearfulsymmetry,2,Sun Jul 12 22:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'll usually also up the contrast, to see where the lightest/darkest places are as well. Also using reference pictures that have a noticeable shadow (as opposed to even lighting) can help."

Watercolor,3d1wjp,dreamflux1,2,Sun Jul 12 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"Depth can be controlled by observing not only the shadows and lighting in form but saturation, contrast and color.    The most saturated elements in our view are those nearest to us,  the least saturated are farther back.   Look out into a forest or field,  the greenest greens are closer to you,   the trees receding into the distance might almost be a pale yellow.  For your picture of the the field and trees, observe the saturation of colors as you go back into the distance.  Contrast, areas that are closer to you/your focal point have the most contrast and detail,   Those farther away less so.  Color selection.  Warm colors generally come forward, cool colors recede. as you start, keep your shadows cooler, and your highlights warmer.  Hope this helps."

Watercolor,3d1wjp,Strigerthompson,2,Tue Jul 14 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"way more detailed than you need but it can help explain cast shadows and form shadows. shadow video Cast shadows vary from light to dark.  Form shadows are usually gradual but with wrinkles in clothing or angled edges they can be crisp.  I have gotten good advice in the sub.  The one that made my images pop out more was using bluer toned shadows and warmer highlights.  It feels like a bad idea until you see it work. There is also something called local color like the kids shirt is green,  but if you add more yellow here, more blue here, add some orange or something to bring the saturation down in spots it will make a big difference.  Also if you add a color's opposite it will tone it down.  Try doing that in the background and less contrast and brightness this will make you foreground pop."

Watercolor,3cyoji,Clawse,8,Sat Jul 11 23:52:57 2015 UTC,I learned to use only a few colors and mix what I can or I just get ickyness.  I also learned to plan ahead and use the best paper I can afford.  My gosh paper makes all the difference.  hugs my Arches block
Watercolor,3cyoji,elbowdoodle,2,Sun Jul 12 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"Enjoy the paper I use but so many swear by arches, why has it earned your trust?"
Watercolor,3cyoji,lookbananafish,2,Sun Jul 12 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"Keeping high quality paper consistent as you learn is essential.  So much of watercolor painting is understanding when to work when the water and paint is still in various stages of wet.   knowing that dropping a touch of crimson on to a blue wash will create an intense gradient or a soft one.  Arches gives the artist enough time to work with pools of water on the paper to slightly damp. You have control over how far the pigment and water will inadvertantly ""spread"" across the page.  The paper is a nice white, but has a little more room for a ""purer white"" highlight with gouache or acrylic at the end.  I still buy other types of paper from time to time to experiment,  but having Arches as my base of reference, I know that certain brands will be ""slipperier"" for wetter washes, some will pool more,  some are too brittle to scrub, etc.  Regardless what you use,  stay consistent and use good watercolor paper to learn."
Watercolor,3cyoji,dreamflux1,2,Mon Jul 13 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"My mother swore by arches and I learned to love it from her.  I have experimented with bunches of other papers and thus far it is my favorite easy accessional paper.  It feels like it is a super thin cotton sponge, it is tactilely pleasing to me and it absorbs paint so much better rather than letting it slide all over.  I feel my colors are brighter and I get less frustrated.  My paints stay where I want and dry at a pace that isn't boring.  And it will stick to your tongue if you lick it."
Watercolor,3cyoji,elbowdoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:43 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
Watercolor,3cyoji,lookbananafish,8,Tue Jul 14 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"Not painting in washes. You really need to wash in everything you can. If you paint objects one by one your painting will not have a feeling of unity. A big preliminary wash over the whole image (leaving only the brigtest whites) will really make everything in the painting harmonise together. No need to painstakingly paint each object. Paint over them. You'll be able to wash in the darks later.   Also - not varying the amount of water used. A good painting should have areas where you're painting with 95% water, areas with basically pure pigment, and everything in between.   Also looseness is not the same as just spashing pigment carelessly. You have to think about where and how you can be loose."
Watercolor,3cyoji,free_ipod,5,Sun Jul 12 06:05:09 2015 UTC,"My worse mistake was not leaving room to mat the painting. My first watercolor is one of my favorites, a circle pixellated thing of my SO's face that I made for him for Christmas.

Watercolor,3cyoji,ladycoleopterist,3,Sun Jul 12 01:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah like this. The paper between the painting and the frame, it protects watercolor paintings because the paint against the glass can be smudged if you live somewhere humid. Drawings you can get away with, but watercolor should always be matted. It gives it a more professional look when framed anyway, even if the mat just matches the paper."

I think that one your other improvements is in the color choice department. from the 2nd to the 4th image, you have really brought a coherent palette to the fore. The fish pond has a really nice balance of mainly cool and noticeable orange with the fish.   Again, using more pigment will really make some colors pop. You can make paints much darker to improve the contrast between the values in your paintings. If you're inclined to read a book, btw, this is one of my favorites. Stephen Quiller is a great example of expressive color"

Watercolor,3cp02h,DenseReals,3,Fri Jul 10 02:30:44 2015 UTC,"You have really improved not only in watercolor but drawing as well.   One thing I've noticed in your works is that you seem to shy away from using lots of pigment or water. Try playing around with more of both to get more comfortable with wetter, less controlled styles. This will also make your washes more consistent because they won't dry before you're finished laying down a layer. Allowing border colors to blend (for example, the place where the lilypads and water touch) can create a really magical look too. You seem to have a strong grasp on preserving whites/lights which commonly gives people trouble so that's great. Keep up the good work!"

Also I usually work with acrylics too and I'm not sure if there's a Michaels store near you but they almost always offer 40%-50% off coupons. That's how I buy my canvases/ other art supplies.

Watercolor,3bvkpq,Sierrahasnolife,4,Thu Jul 2 16:56:50 2015 UTC,You mask off areas with masking fluid or tape.  Then you literally pour watercolor paint that has been watered down onto the canvas.  You control where the color goes by tilting the canvas and using a sprayer.  Its great messy fun.

Here's my considerate critique: Look at where your details are in the depth/visual plane. the right paw (our left), right shoulder, right side of the face. However, it looks like the left paw (our right) is on the same plane as those areas, yet doesn't have any detail hairs.   TL;DR add some detail hairs to the right paw/elbow area (our left)."

Watercolor,3b35dx,wie_gehtz,3,Thu Jun 25 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  I'd recommend reading this page on Dick Blick's website regarding basic ASTM and California Prop 65 labelling rules for art supplies.  Chances are good that, if the packaging for your set of watercolors bears the ASTM Certified Non-Toxic label (and no California Prop 65 warning), you're good to go!    The one caveat in this thinking is that, of course, the ASTM is done for humans, not all animals.  According to my previous research, none of the common ingredients in all watercolor paints is anything that should be toxic -- in fact, it's mostly stuff we use in food!  Gum arabic to make things thick, glycerin as a preservative, corn syrup to make things sweeter, dextrin for enhancing crispness and as a fiber substitute, and the dispersants we use in soap are the primary ingredients in watercolors, aside from the pigments.  And clearly none of these in small quantities should make a cat sick! ;)  The only thing left to examine if we want to make absolutely sure these are safe would be the pigments.  This might be tricky or near impossible on a generic brand watercolor set like Artist's Loft.  That said, if you can find out information about these paints, the main ones you want to look out for are anything with cadmium, chromium, or cobalt. It is highly, highly unlikely that any of these inexpensive watercolors would have these ingredients, especially if they're marketed as safe for kids and have the Certified Non-Toxic label, but it's definitely something to look out for in the future.  As a final note, I do want to mention this:  as someone who has spent his life surrounded by cats, I know that cats sometimes enjoy some very... strange things.  I've seen cats go completely bonkers and salivate over plastic bags, and I've seen a cat that licks the adhesive side of tape.  It might be worthwhile to supervise your cat closely around your watercolored houses to make sure they don't decide that your painting would be better served as a tasty treat ;)  So, the practical upshot of all this is that in all likelihood, your watercolors are totally safe for your new cat to occasionally bite through.  If you're paranoid like me, you can do some research on the specific pigments to make sure, but you should be quite fine :D"
Watercolor,3b35dx,h2g2guy,2,Thu Jun 25 19:13:29 2015 UTC,Wow! Thanks so much for all this info--I'll check out the pigment info to be sure it's safe! :)))) You're awesome!
Watercolor,3b35dx,h2g2guy,2,Fri Jun 26 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"No problem, and I'm happy to help!  If you do figure out what pigments are in your set, it might be worthwhile to do a Google search on each one (or at least each type of pigment present*) asking about cats individually. Very few sites have comprehensive information about paints, and the main one that is comprehensive (handprint) doesn't say much about toxicity aside from that it's not a huge worry for humans and animals when used properly.   Good luck! :D  *By 'type of pigment', in case you're not as obsessive about watercolor production as I am, I mean that there are certain chemicals that are used in a variety ofof pigments. These are usually easily identifiable, because you'll see a variety of paints with similar words in their names, like ""pthalocyanine red"" and ""pthalocyanine blue""."

You may also want to look into buying a opaque white watercolor if you plan on doing more things like this, although white acrylic paint also works reasonably well for now. Just a quick tip, the ground shouldn't start in the corners, it just look a little off, maybe try something with a little less curvature but also not completely straight.

If you'd really like some advice, I have a challenge to offer you if you are interested in trying out a wholly new approach to layering colors. My old instructor had the maxim that ""The best watercolor painters never used white pigments or black pigments."" I thought they were off their rocker until I tried it, doing the same painting twice: once using black and white pigments with color, the second time using only resists and colors.  And damn it if they weren't right. I've found that when I'm pushed to use any color but black, if I don't fuck the whole thing up with rushing the layering, the painting gets a whole new depth to it. What do you think of trying that out?"

Try observing the shapes and colors of the lighting vs the color of the clothing etc.   Right now you seem mostly to be coloring areas in instead of rendering the light.

Watercolor,399zau,aliceblack,4,Wed Jun 10 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"Do not bring white. In fact, throw your white out. White should never be used in watercolor. The white of the paper is your white. If you need to add highlights after the fact, use a white gel pen or a gouache or acrylic.
