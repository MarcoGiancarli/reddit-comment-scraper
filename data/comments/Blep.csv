Blep,3dl09r,Meadslosh,11,Fri Jul 17 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"I second /u/BumblebeeCurdlesnoot's suggestion of naming the kitties for moons.  Io is a good name for a rambunctious kitten: it's a geologically violent world, the most active in the Solar System; its magnetic relationship with Jupiter causes Jupiter to flash with lightning.  Callisto is relatively quiet and still in comparison; we suspect that it is primarily ice and rock all the way through, with a chance for there to be a water ocean beneath its thick, solid surface. The presence of ancient, undisturbed craters on its outside tells us that it experiences little geological activity. Some astronomers go so far as to call it a ""dead world.""  Europa is somewhere between: we have strong evidence, including enormous plumes of water on its surface, to believe that it has a liquid ocean below its thick surface of ice. The cracking and constant smoothing of its surface tells us it is alive with geological activity and the movement of water. It is not an especially violent world, but it is not comatose like Callisto. (We suspect it to be one of the best places in the Solar System to find exolife. If chemosynthesis happens in its ocean, then life could thrive!)  Going by colors alone, from left to right, I'd name them Europa (it has a dirty white-brown surface), Io (it has a yellow-red surface), and Callisto (which has a dark, still surface).  Has science gone too cute?"
Blep,3dl09r,Meadslosh,5,Fri Jul 17 14:03:48 2015 UTC,"They are named after the moons! And you correctly identified Europa and Callisto!  The boy in the middle is Ganymede, the largest moon, because he was the largest at the time we named them. We skipped Io, didn't seem to fit any of them.  Not pictures- the twin calicoes Amalthea and Adrastea (Amy and Addy)."

Blep,3d92n4,Stefferdiddle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:58 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness this is almost exactly like mine, just missing a white chin and orange stripe on the forehead!"
Blep,3d92n4,poofacedlemur,2,Wed Jul 15 08:38:00 2015 UTC,"Aw! Do you think this kitten will have long, medium or short hair? The mother has short/medium, but we don't know about the father. My mom is worried she will have to take care of a long-haired cat."
Blep,3d92n4,poofacedlemur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:10:14 2015 UTC,"Mine is medium/long hair, but I honestly haven't noticed much of a difference from taking care of a short hair. Just run a comb (they make special ones for long hair that help with tangles) through the fur once every day or two and be wary of the fur between the toes when clipping nails. Since cats are pretty independent animals, they do a good job of taking care of the rest."
Blep,3d92n4,poofacedlemur,2,Wed Jul 15 19:41:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer!  We have talked about that, and she concluded that combing the hair and such will be okay. But she is worried about hair being everywhere, and my brother is allergic to cats and they think he reacts more to long-haired cats. He doesn't live with her though, but he visits maybe once a month.  I have to read more about allergy and cat hair types."
Blep,3d92n4,poofacedlemur,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:16 2015 UTC,Oh you're welcome! Just wanna make sure this cutie is taken care of.  Definitely understandable concerns. My best friend happens to be allergic to cats and we did some research. Turns out long haired cats have a lower concentration of the enzyme that causes allergic reactions in their saliva than short haired ones do. The frequent combing of the cat will help shake the dandruff that would become airborne as well as keep the house relatively fur-free.

Blep,3d5nun,Youtube_Junkie,12,Tue Jul 14 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"I call them ""kitten nuggets"" :)"

Blep,3d5nun,Youtube_Junkie,-4,Tue Jul 14 06:09:01 2015 UTC,spay your cat
Blep,3d5nun,uberQ,10,Tue Jul 14 04:45:10 2015 UTC,"This is a good message, but not everyone who lets their animal breed does it irresponsibly. You may want to tone down that commanding tone just a bit."
Blep,3d5nun,Tyr808,-5,Tue Jul 14 07:47:12 2015 UTC,There are too many stray kittens. Breeding your cat is irresponsible by definition. Adopt.
Blep,3d5nun,starlinguk,12,Tue Jul 14 08:10:22 2015 UTC,"There are too many stray children. People still have kids. Some people prefer to continue the lineage of their pets, some don't care. I agree that there are a ton of strays that should get homes, but ultimately as long as the breeder is being responsible and either keeping all the kittens or finding them quality homes (usually friend and family), they're really not doing anything wrong.   For the record, both my cats are adopted, but that doesn't mean everyone else HAS to.   I do understand the emotional space you're coming from though."
Blep,3d5nun,Tyr808,3,Tue Jul 14 10:48:32 2015 UTC,"Good points! The irony is that the mum cat above was adopted as stray, was pregnant and we will keep or re-home all of the kittens..!"
Blep,3d5nun,starlinguk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:35:54 2015 UTC,Stray kittens are just as cute as bred kittens. I honestly don't see any reason why anyone would want to buy a breed. But maybe that's because an awful lot of people around here don't give a flying monkey's about cat breeds either. Most cats are ex-shelter cats.
Blep,3d5nun,Tyr808,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"I almost bred my cat, who was an adopted street cat simply because we love her and thought it would be a fun and special thing to let her have her own kittens and raise them.  We didn't in the end and adopted another street kitten, and you're right, they are just as cute, it was just something we were thinking about.   By this logic no one should ever have kids either because you can adopt kids. Of course humans aren't cats so it doesn't directly compare, but ultimately it's just something some people value one way or another. No one should EVER create new life of any form though if they can't or won't responsibly and properly raise it though."
Blep,3d5nun,Purrplecat,2,Tue Jul 14 14:47:30 2015 UTC,"Depends where you live. Our local shelter actually only has two cats up for adoption, because the capture, neuter and release program (which they set up) is such a grand success. Yes, that is still two cats too many, but they came from an owner that passed away and they need to be adopted as a pair. Fairly sure they'll find homes soon again."
