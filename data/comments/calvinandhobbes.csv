calvinandhobbes,3dgl42,siccoblue,9,Thu Jul 16 14:18:40 2015 UTC,"What about the fans that respect Bill Watterson's views on commercializing his products?  He believes anything derivative like this waters down the original message of his works. It's a bit pretentious, but I feel like he earned it.    It's one thing to make it for your own personal use, but this person is selling them for 40 bucks on Etsy or something.  I don't agree with that at all."
calvinandhobbes,3dgl42,Dlgredael,8,Thu Jul 16 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"I think his issue is more with the commercialization of it all.    But yeah, it's also against the rules to sell, or help others sell, C&H merchandise.  Every time I bring up Watterson's views on the matter, I get downvoted.  Every time I ask how people can justify loving the work but disrespecting the creator of said work, I am never given an answer.  Whenever I ask why people think it's okay for others to profit off someone else's creation, it too goes unanswered.  The only answer you'll get is ""but I waaaaant it!"", which apparently makes it okay.  Yet I don't think anyone here, if they were truly honest with themselves, would he okay with someone else profiting from their own hard work.  And even if they were somehow okay with it, that still doesn't give them free reign to the same, or to disrespect Watterson's wishes."
calvinandhobbes,3dgl42,eidetic,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:21 2015 UTC,I love the work but when Watterson chose not to commercialize C&H I don't think he had this kind of stuff in mind. The whole thing is to avoid massive corporations making C&H merch and ruining the spirit of the comics. I doubt Watterson is opposed to fans making cool stuff for each other and charging a service fee.
calvinandhobbes,3dgl42,The_Homestarmy,4,Thu Jul 16 20:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't see how one can make such a claim.  He has never, to my knowledge, made any kind of statements as such.  While I don't think he'd be opposed to people making and gifting homemade C&H stuff, I also can't say that for certain.  But how is one person on Etsy any different than a big corporation?  Where does one draw the line?  Is one person working on it after their day job okay?  What about a sewing circle that decides to make and sell them?  Why is one more acceptable than the other?    OP is making a profit off Watterson's creation.  She is making a profit off someone else's creation against their wishes.  Assuming Watterson would be okay with people making their own C&H stuff, and even assuming he'd be okay with people giving that stuff away for free, I don't see how there is any kind of justification for profiting off someone else's work when they haven't given any of indication that they would be okay with that.  And not only that, but in this case there is absolutely no indication or evidence that he'd be okay with it, and actually all indications point towards him most likely not being okay with it.  And I don't see how the lack of approval for any such unlicensed merchandising can lead to the assumption he'd be okay with it when he has taken a strong stance against licensed merchandising, and merchandising in general  Simply put, him not making a statement stating his specific stance on this and similar situations does not mean it is your decision to make.   The whole thing is to avoid massive corporations making C&H merch and ruining the spirit of the comics.   Again, there's no real difference between a single person making and selling such stuff to make money, and a boardroom of people making the decision to sell such things to make money.  Yes, a corporation may have profit as the sole driving factor whereas OP might also have the desire to share and spread the love and joy of C&H as a contributing factor, but make no mistake that she's in this to make money as well.  And any other reasons do not justify, or nullify, that fact.  If her sole desire was to share and spread her love and the joy of C&H with others, she wouldn't, and shouldn't, be selling it and making a profit.  He might even be okay with someone charging or accepting donations for costs of materials.  But again, we can't say for certain and is not up to us to decide.     the spirit of the comics.   Now obviously I can't state with authority on the matter of the spirit of the comics, but I have to strongly disagree with your conclusion on the spirit of the comics as it relates to merchandising.  If you ask me, the spirit of the comics would be totally contrary to someone - be it a corporation or a single person - profiting off the work and creation of someone else.  Furthermore, the spirit of the strip to me would be more along the lines of ""finding your own Hobbes"" instead of merely copying/mimicking the actual Hobbes.  While that applies more to the character of Hobbes and less to the actual physical form, I still think simply copying the style of Hobbes is contrary to the strip's spirit.  Again, I obviously can't speak authoritatively on the subject (though the spirit to me is also finding your own meaning, etc), but I don't think it's a leap to say commercializing someone else's creation against their will is completely counter to the strip.  Especially since you can see such sentiments and similar thoughts echoed in the actual comics, especially during the time period of the battle he fought with the publishers on the matter.  And again, make no mistake, she is commercializing his work.  The fact that she's not a big corporation does not change that one bit.  Edit: I forgot a key ""not"" in a sentence."

Can't we respect the wishes of the creator who gave us so much joy?  That said, I ways find these kind of poses when showing hats and such hilarious.  I know the point is to show how they fit on the head while at the same time keeping the focus on the hat and not the person wearing it, but it always strikes me as goofy, like the person is trying to look all deep and introspective while wearing such a fun hat.  Again, I completely know that's not the point at all, and not what the person is trying to do, it just strikes me as funny is all.  And no, I'm not in any way shape or form suggesting it should be done any differently.  Edit: Downvote me all you want, but it's also against the rules of the sub:   Bill Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work. He felt that would cheapen his comic. We respect that. Please, don't try to make money with C&H merchandise or help others to do so.   Seriously though, why wouldn't you respect the wishes of the creator?  Why would you give money to someone who attempts to profit off someone else's creations?  Especially someone who claims to love the creation, but doesn't respect the creator?"

I also love, how out of all the lessons Watterson gave us, that is the one you want to preach.   Do you not understand the simple concept of context?  Or relevancy?  I preach about this topic in this particular thread because it's relevant to the topic at hand. Seriously, how can you not grasp such a simple concept?  I'm not going to go off on a rant about people making a buck off Watterson's creations in a thread that has nothing to do with merchandising.  Instead, like I've done in this very topic, I'll discuss something relevant to whatever that other topic may be.  And since you're apparently unaware, Watterson fought very hard to keep C&H from being over commercialized, and one of the biggest steps he took towards that end was to limit (almost to the point of complete exclusion) merchandising of his creation.  It's a pretty big part of the story of C&H, right up there with his fight for more freedom in the Sunday editions in regards to giving himself more freedom to express himself by fighting to do away with many of the formatting restrictions that were then commonly in place.  Oh yeah, not to mention merchandising is against the rules if this sub.  Do try and keep up."

At row 9, dch about 27ish in orange, and then switch to black until the end of the row.   Switch back to orange, do 2 rows of that, and repeat the black row, ending with two orange rows.    And then weave in all your ends.    For the ear muff part, I think I chained 10 sch into the hat part, and sch a total of 3 rows before a row of decreasing.    Then I did the white front part... I also dch that into the front, and I just go by feel for that part..... (You can probably just use the picture for reference.)  I then used white yarn, and made a border around the ear muffs on both sides with single crochet.    For the ears, I sch 5, skip to stitches and dch 2 into the first of three, dch 3 into the second, and dch 2 into the 3rd.  Then dch across that, and decrease to shape the ears in the next row.  (Two of both orange and white for the ears.)  Then just sch the two sides together with black and sew them on.  :)  Hopefully that is usable... I'm not the best at writing patterns XD"

calvinandhobbes,3dgl42,Slap_Choppa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Please remember that Watterson was against the merchandising of his creation.  Please also keep in mind that OP is profiting off someone else's creation.  And while a mod has told me they will remove posts that link to unlicensed merchandise, he/she also said they won't delete comments asking where to buy such things.  I don't understand why not, though the reason seems to be that they'd rather inform those who are seeking such merchandise that Watterson is against said merchandising, since they might simply be unaware.  I personally don't think Watterson would have an issue with people gifting homemade C&H stuff to friends, family, and even strangers online, but I can't say for sure.  His views on commercialized merchandising are clear though.  Does it suck you can't go out and buy your own official Hobbes stuffed animal?  I guess, maybe, depending on the person it may suck.  But I can't see any justification for buying unlicensed stuff.  Simply saying ""but I waaaaant it"" isn't really a valid justification.    Someone else profiting off the work of someone, against that creator's wishes, is certainly not justifiable.  And it's kind of lame and a downright low thing to do if you ask me.  Think about it, if you created something, would you be okay with someone else recreating it and profiting off it without you seeing a dime?  And even if someone says they are okay with that and truly believe that, that does not mean they can justifiably ignore another creator's wishes.    I know reddit isn't some homogeneous group where everyone thinks and acts exactly the same, but the vast, vast majority of people here would be up in arms if they provided original content to reddit, and discovered that some other website had copied and profited off that content.  Or if they posted a picture to Facebook or Flickr or what have you, and discovered some other site or publication using, selling, or otherwise profiting from that image."

I sketched it out in pencil and then painted on top of it. The water was tricky because I had to water down the paint to make it look like water-color.

calvinandhobbes,3d2xiz,Wadofwade,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:37 2015 UTC,Thank you! It's acrylic on canvas; I cheated a little by using sharpie for the sharp details. I watered down the paint for the water to try and mimic water-coloring.
calvinandhobbes,3d2xiz,majeric,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Those are all great ideas. There's no such thing as ""cheated"". It's just ""mix media"". :)"

Not fucking around with a $5 bid either. Seriously. PM me please! You could make a killing until you got your cease and desist letter. A whole series of stills... That last shot of them on the sled as he says ""let's go exploring!"" Would be another beautiful piece. Idk just spitballing."

calvinandhobbes,3d07zk,Sno_Wolf,4,Mon Jul 13 00:47:05 2015 UTC,What are you correcting?
calvinandhobbes,3d07zk,combuchan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:49:19 2015 UTC,The only more I see is when Calvin's dad is yelling at him. But it's spelled correctly.
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,ThoseDamnPixels,15,Sat Jul 11 18:38:41 2015 UTC,I don't understand why the male character is pretending that he doesn't like the dog when the female character is around.
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,mattsprofile,30,Sat Jul 11 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"It looks like the woman brought the dog home unannounced one day, and he said: ""this is a terrible idea, I don't have time for this dog, so you have to take care of it.""  Skip to a few weeks/months/years (who knows) down the line, and he secretly loves the dog but refuses to admit that getting the dog was a great idea."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,Hamohater,14,Sat Jul 11 23:21:45 2015 UTC,"If you read back in the archives it makes more sense. Sort of a ""I was mad when you got the dog and now I'm still trying to be grumpy even though I grew to like it... It's a matter of principal!"" Sort of thing."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,Pelican451,2,Sat Jul 11 23:56:00 2015 UTC,The situation I currently find myself in.  Edit: Going on 2 years now.
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,tistorm,2,Sun Jul 12 05:19:24 2015 UTC,"Lol yup. It's tough, especially when you've made it clear you didn't want a dog at all. This little critter is clumsy, clingy, demanding... And freaking adorable."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,dooby181,2,Sun Jul 12 12:43:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that since the dog is going along with it too, they're just doing it to fuck with the woman."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,MicCheck123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:16:36 2015 UTC,Sometimes it seems like Taffy (the dog) totally understands that I play with her more when we're alone. It's funny. Alyssa will leave and taffy will suddenly be sitting in front of me with her toys.
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,llamabreaker,2,Sun Jul 12 12:45:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I was thinking that too!
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,frustman,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have either until  last night. We went out with another couple, and the guy says how much he hates dogs, but we've all seen pictures of him snuggling up to puppies when he thinks no one is around."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,frustman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"I have no explaination for why I'm like this, lol. Yeah, Alyssa (my wife) knows I like the dog now but I made such a stink when she brought the dog home it's just hard to let on that I like her so much now."
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,fatboy_slimfast,8,Sun Jul 12 12:47:11 2015 UTC,this is so cute and you really got the body poses down right! lost an hour or so going through your archives 10/10 would procrastinate again
calvinandhobbes,3cxpdv,fatboy_slimfast,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:08:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! :)
calvinandhobbes,3cxhy7,Surefif,2,Sat Jul 11 17:34:19 2015 UTC,Calvin reminds me of the grinch in panel 3.
