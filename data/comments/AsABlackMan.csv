AsABlackMan,3e1p5m,ARealProGenius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:58 2015 UTC,That's true and is legally relevant. My point was just that people who are free speech advocates are usually advocates for speech they disagree with too.  So someone who is Jewish may very well be advocating for as little censorship as possible both because of free speech arguments and because of the reason that person cited: that people openly discussing their ideas is probably less cancerous than suppressing and stifling them.
AsABlackMan,3e1p5m,cincofone,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:59 2015 UTC,"Reddit is under no obligation to build them a platform and allow them to speak on it.   people openly discussing their ideas is probably less cancerous than suppressing and stifling them   Not giving them an audience is not stifling them.  They can crawl back to stormfront.  Paying for ad free space for them though, that's what's actually going on and it's disgusting.  Being on reddit gives them some legitimacy that they wouldn't have otherwise.  It's a seal of approval.  Also posts on this sub also apply if the user seems to speak for his whole group even if he is Jewish.  That's one thing he doesn't seem to understand in his comments where he calls this sub racist."
