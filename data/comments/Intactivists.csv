Intactivists,3cvepj,dalkon,7,Sat Jul 11 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"The Globe and Mail: Circumcised or not, it matters little to sexual partners, study shows   Researchers at Queen’s University surveyed 196 people in sexual relationships with men, including women and men, and found that in spite of their reported preferences, they were very satisfied with their partners’ circumcision status and overwhelmingly did not wish for anything different.  The study, published online on July 9 in the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, found men and women held different views about circumcision. Female participants reported a slight preference for circumcised partners for certain sex acts and regarded circumcised penises more positively, believing them to be more hygienic, more attractive and in line with social norms. By contrast, male respondents strongly preferred partners with intact penises for all sexual activities, and held more positive beliefs about intact penises, the study said. Despite these stated preferences, the presence or absence of a man’s foreskin had little impact on his partner’s sexual function, including desire, arousal, ability to orgasm and satisfaction. Women with uncircumcised partners reported higher levels of sexual satisfaction than did women with circumcised partners, though Bossio noted it’s unclear whether there’s a statistically significant difference.  While much research has focused on the health implications of circumcision, the Queen’s University study – albeit with a relatively small sample size – helps shed some light on the lesser examined impact of the presence or absence of foreskin on men’s sex lives and those of their partners. Emphasizing her research team takes no sides in the circumcision debate, Bossio noted the new findings may offer reassurance for all men, as far as how they’re regarded in the bedroom.  “Even if a woman … really prefers a circumcised penis and she gets into a relationship with a man who’s not circumcised, at the end of the day, I don’t think he has much to worry about,” she says. “Women and men, they tend to be really, really happy with their partner’s circumcision status, regardless of what that is.”   Do homosexual men practice better penile hygiene? Or were gay men just more aware of how uncommon hygiene problems are, while women were more likely to assume that intact foreskin would be dirty based on more limited or no experience? The fact that the word ""believing"" is used in reference to considering modified more hygienic makes it seem more likely they were evaluating mere assumptions rather a comparison based on even excessively limited experience. Like most popular writing about research, this doesn't say enough about the researchers' methods. Unfortunately the paper doesn't seem to be posted anywhere yet either.  I remember this survey being posted on reddit last year. I thought the questions were clearly designed to collect negative reports about the foreskin. I copied some of the questions as evidence of the researchers' bias, but I haven't been able to find my notes about it.  * What's most striking about this circumcision promotion is how subtle it is. Circumcision activists usually promote the surgery more forcefully than this. I would assume this is so subtle because Bossio is trying to present herself as a neutral and unbiased researcher rather than a circumcision activist like Morris or Krieger."
Intactivists,3cvepj,zimmer199,6,Sat Jul 11 02:35:21 2015 UTC,"The study reports that circumcision status matters little, which should be taken to mean you shouldn't cut your kids just so they aren't sexual pariahs."

I've been hearing this for years. Yet, it hasn't happened. At least since 2011 they've been expecting to change their stance ""any day now"".

Intactivists,3cr4bj,dalkon,2,Fri Jul 10 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"This research is about Asperger's (an autism spectrum disorder) correlating with paraphilias (""sexual perversion"").  Frisch & Simonsen (2015) showed that developmentally defective foreskin (and consequent therapeutic/non-cultural foreskin excision) correlated quite strongly with autism spectrum disorders (+300%). That finding involved a particularly small subsample and was not the focus of the research. They were looking at the correlation for the implication of surgery causing ASD, which there may well be, but it would seem there must also be correlation without causation (or with a common cause).  This all raises interesting questions about how these correlations were misinterpreted in the past. Historically, some circumcision activists would appear to have been aware of these correlations to some extent but they misinterpreted them as the fault of the foreskin rather than understanding whatever higher-level developmental failure should be responsible for both.  Research like this would also appear to help us to understand that large contingent of internet circumcision activists who also fetishize the surgery and the modified state of the penis."
Intactivists,3cr4bj,Melian9,2,Fri Jul 10 03:13:21 2015 UTC,You're making quite a leap by connecting all this to circumfetishism - and one that probably only makes sense from a neurobigoted or transphobic perspective.
Intactivists,3cr4bj,Melian9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:56:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I realized I might come off this way using this paper. That is why I explained in a previous comment that I didn't think the contents of this paper were very important and that I was only referencing it for the statement that paraphilias and ASD correlate. I am very sorry if I've maligned aspies, transfolk or intactivists with foreskin defects.  Maybe I can explain where I'm coming from with my line of thought here. People who encourage forcing nontherapeutic genital modifications on children offend me, so I would like to understand what is wrong with them or what makes them the way they are.   Apparently the most vociferous anti-autonomy/pro-surgery activists have paraphilias involving genital surgery. They have erotica forums about it all over the internet including on reddit. Religious reasons also account for a large part of the surgery advocates and cultural advocates are the rest, but the people who have worked the hardest to oppose intactivism are the circumfetishist circumcision activists. Unfortunately, they have not been as ineffective as you might assume (or hope). To the extent that they don't talk about liking the surgery itself and sexualizing the threat of surgery, they can sound like everyone else in our circumcising culture. They have had considerable influence in the debate. One of their sites, Circlist used to be the highest traffic site on the internet about the issue, and a member from that group controlled the key Wikipedia page for years until some chum took over a couple years ago.  Paraphilias (of myriad sorts) and ASD, and ASD and defective foreskin are both correlated. If you looked through those links I gave in my last comment on this post, asexuality is actually correlated too, so it's an extremely wide range of atypical sexual behaviors and paraphilias that are correlated, and as far as I know, they're normally exclusive, so I know it's much less definite than you might think I was trying to imply.  Why is acknowledging the correlations between ASD, defective foreskin, and paraphilias bigotry?  Can I ask, were you already familiar with circumfetishism or is this the first you've heard of it? Do you consider circumfetishist circumcision activism unethical?"
Intactivists,3cr4bj,6658,2,Tue Jul 14 03:28:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm familiar with circumfetishism. I've been an intactivist for a long time. I consider all pro-(medically unnecessary) circumcision activism unethical.  Among people on the spectrum there is a lot of concern about a tendency these days in the media to try to link any kind of violent, antisocial behavior to ASD.   I guess what I'm wondering is where ASD comes into your picture. Are you basing this theory on the (misleading) characterization of people on the spectrum as ""incapable of empathy"", for instance? Or do you just mean to suggest a there's link between defective foreskins, circumcision and a tendency toward paraphilias, resulting in circumfetishism as a reaction to circumcision trauma?   As for trans folk, labeling transexualism as a paraphilia is offensive and inaccurate, and yet most of your links intended to show a link between ASD and ""paraphilias"" are actually about ASD and transexualism.   http://www.tsroadmap.com/info/autogynephilia.html  https://gidreform.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/gender-dysphoria-diagnosis-to-be-moved-out-of-sexual-disorders-chapter-of-dsm-5/"
Intactivists,3cr4bj,Negative_Clank,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"I see. Thank you for pointing out exactly in what ways I might appear bigoted. I didn't mean to imply the correlation with ASD was as significant as you thought I did. In my reasoning, ASD was only significant for serving as a statistical factor linking defective foreskin with paraphilias (of myriad types). You didn't mention it, but I think my use of ""perversion"" was totally unfair in addition to being imprecise. I regret it. I wanted to gloss paraphilia, but I should be careful to only use such a judgmental word to describe unethical paraphilias. To be more clear, I realize that the paraphilias that correlate with ASD tend to be ethical and harmless. As at least one of those previously linked references showed, texture/textile paraphilias appear to be among the most common.  Johns Hopkins still categorizes transgenderism as a paraphilia like that, don't they? Yes, here's something one of their psychiatrists wrote about it: Transgenderism: A Pathogenic Meme.   It's notable that that university has also been home to many of the most vociferous circumcision activists of the past 4 decades especially those responsible for the deceptive African HIV RCTs.  The argument that transgenderism is a paraphilia (or an inability to accept reality) could parallel a hypothetical argument against being displeased with unwanted genital modification (whether circumcision, female genital cutting or intersex gender assignment). JHU faculty also created iatrogenic gender dysphoria with Dr. Money's pioneering experiments in gender reassignment. There are so many reasons to distrust the opinions of JHU faculty when it comes to genital surgery, it's kind of hard to believe their opinions would be valued by anyone.   Are you basing this theory on the (misleading) characterization of people on the spectrum as ""incapable of empathy"", for instance?   A lack of normal empathy could presumably be related to circumcision activist circumfetishism and unethical paraphilias in general, but I had not considered that until now. I would need to think about that more before I could say what I think about it. I will be sure to avoid implying anything about the empathy of people with ASD.   Among people on the spectrum there is a lot of concern about a tendency these days in the media to try to link any kind of violent, antisocial behavior to ASD.    I was not aware of that, but I can see how that would disturb people with ASD. Were you talking about people commenting about mass murderers like Adam Lanza and Anders Brevik though? I think (hope) everyone realizes how extremely rare psychopathy like that is and doesn't let it affect their perception of ASD.  It's interesting that a somewhat similar mass anxiety like that you fear occurred in the US near the end of the 19th century involving phimosis and psychopathy. This was considered an important argument for circumcision at the time (Athol A.W. Johnson 1860; Richard Barwell 1872; William D. Gentry 1890; Jonathan Hutchinson 1890; Morris 1893; S. G. A. Brown 1897; and everything about epilepsy would have played into that too and the parallel argument about genital abnormalities in girls and insanity Isaac Baker Brown 1866; and advocating both male and female cutting: Charles E. Fisher 1895; Edgar J. Spratling 1895; T. Scott McFarland 1898; Edwin H. Pratt 1898; M. O. Terry 1900; Roswell Park 1902—to list a small sample of this research most of which is in the /r/Intactivists/wiki timeline of medicalization of genital cutting).  This history is what I referencing in my previous comment about historical circumcision activism. Charles Guiteau assassinated James Garfield in 1882.   Remondino wrote at length about the foreskin as a ""moral outlaw"" in 1891. This line of thought was especially popular with a variety of surgery-enthusiast homeopathic doctors, the Orificial Surgical Society (/r/Intactivists/wiki: timeline of medicalizing genital cutting: Orificial Surgical Society).  To return to one of my original points and explain my intent with this line of thought again, I think that as intactivists, it's in our interest to understand circumfetishist circumcision activism as well as possible because though they might seem insignificant, they are our most dedicated opponents on the internet.

What makes parental child genital cutting defensible whatsoever let alone more important than personal body autonomy? Which is the more salient civil liberty cutting children's genitals or having a right to not have your own genitalia destructively modified (or in many cases objectively mutilated) for nontherapeutic reasons?  This despicable law would appear to be a direct response to the 2007 Oregon lawsuit in which a father who had recently converted religion was attempting to force a religiously motivated genital surgery on his 12-year-old son against the boy's wishes and his mother's. In that case, the courts sided with the boy and in later legal decisions, the father eventually lost all custody rights over the boy for attempting to force genital surgery on him.  The ACLU's actions here were completely disgraceful. This law they jammed through is begging for a legal challenge that should make the ACLU look as despicable as they are to have promoted this.  I appreciated the explanation of the ACLU's teenagers-have-no-right-to-their-body California circumcision law a lot, but I can't help but notice that, in this video, these protesters don't appear to have been super effective at this particular event. Maybe it wasn't possible to be more effective. Or maybe a more basic explanation of intactivism might have been more effective. By that I mean, they might have focused more on specifically how foreskin excision can fairly be considered mutilating. Of course, it's easy to speculate about what might have worked better in retrospect. At least they tried, and maybe people who weren't in the video were more receptive to their message.  * Here's the text of Assembly Bill No. 768, which is fairly ambiguous in how it limits the rights of one parent to prevent genital surgery from befalling a child, but that is what it would appear to do with the text: ""No city, county, or city and county ordinance, regulation, or administrative action shall prohibit or restrict the practice of male circumcision, or the exercise of a [one] parent’s authority to have a child circumcised [including the child regardless of age or the other parent?]."""

Notwithstanding that there's a doctor in Florida who was willing to cut Chase, a 4.5 year old, against his will, I don't think there'd be a doctor willing to cut a teenager against his will. As to whether the teen could be convinced it was okay, that seems not terribly likely, but not impossible due to the ubiquity of information.

The goal is to be persuasive and encourage people to spread our message. This is the age-old process of converting people to future supporters. Browbeating just isn’t effective. Here’s how I know. No amount of haranguing, yelling, spitting, or shoving is going to change my mind that circumcision is barbaric. So I’m pretty sure the opposite is also true for diehard pro-circers.  [¶]  So why do people continue with ineffective behavior? The Maslow quote above seems to apply [""If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.""]. Plus, some folks love the “thrill of opposition,” which goes a long way to explain why people persist in unproductive behavior. There’s an adrenaline boost, you get to feel superior, and you think your fellow protesters will be impressed by your actions (sadly, some of them will). The downside is that if you are acting as an antagonist (the villain or anti-hero), you’ll scare away open-minded people who might otherwise have listened to your message. To me, it seems like a better investment to remain approachable and work on the fence sitters; better to be a protagonist (hero) and spread your message instead of your hate. [...]  We all have important roles to fill and all of us should strive to improve our effectiveness while changing our ineffective behaviors. And, we all have a vested interest in making sure our group efforts are as effective as possible by monitoring each other. After all, we all identify strongly with the victims and we want the same goal. But this movement only works if we are all open to changing our own behavior.   One of the simplest points to take from this is that by correcting bad intactivism when we see it, we make our message more compelling.  To all these wise words, I might add that it's worth recognizing the fact that intactivists are working against a similar grassroots cultural movement, circumcisionism, the religious, social and cultural belief that personal consent for genital surgery is inconsequential and that all penises should be circumcised.   Besides circumcision advocates who we are trying to win to our side, there are circumcision activists who pose as negative-rebel intactivists in order to make intactivism look stupid by association especially on the internet where that's as easy as it is.

Intactivists,3biugs,skintact81,8,Mon Jun 29 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"The issue of the debate was reporting child abuse. That is why the committee chair (Dr. Chrisholm) said Dr. Lampert was speaking about an unrelated topic. It would have been fairer to say that the question of whether nontherapeutic circumcision should be considered abusive is controversial.  Is genital cutting child abuse? In 2012, an online survey of Australian doctors found 74% believe newborn circumcision should not be offered to parents and 51% consider it tantamount to child abuse. Considering involuntary nontherapeutic genital cutting abusive is obviously controversial within the medical community.   Of course it's interesting that there is controversy when it comes to boys, but when it comes to girls, everyone agrees it's abusive. Well, nearly everyone agrees. In the US in 2010, the AAP actually issued a statement on female genital cutting recommending doctors offer minor cutting for girls to placate parents who might otherwise have more destructive surgery performed by someone unqualified to perform the surgery. The recommendation was thoroughly criticized before it was retracted, but it shows how much less averse to genital cutting doctors in the US are compared to cultures without normalized infant genital cutting.  That conciliation on cutting girls' genitalia was not entirely without precedent. The US has a very long history of medicalizing female genital cutting. In the US, vaguely therapeutic destructive genital surgeries for both boys and girls were considered ethical as recently as the 1960s, and voluntary adult cosmetic female genital surgery was a popular trend in the US in the 1970s. The latter is obviously not abusive, but the idea that women are being socially pressured to conform to social norms of a surgical standard of appearance offends most Americans deeply when considering African women choosing the surgery. Why do we imagine motives in Africa to be so different from our own?   In the US, parents who were concerned about female children's masturbation could have a daughter's clitoris excised if they could find a willing doctor until the 1970s. Here is one woman's story of this: American medical clitoridectomy female genital mutilation (13 min).  Though it does not yet consider male genital cutting abusive, in a statement on the ethics of circumcision, the British Medical Association listed numerous concerns and reservations with involuntary nontherapeutic medicalized circumcision: ""It is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. […] Very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. […] Parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child."""

Intactivists,3b577g,dalkon,4,Fri Jun 26 01:48:13 2015 UTC,"Medical nontherapeutic sex assigning intersex genital surgery has generally been much more destructive than even the most destructive forms of female genital cutting, yet the thought of criminalizing intersex genital cutting has never occurred to most. The long history of intersex genital surgery helps to show how savage medicalized surgery can be. In this essay, the author uses intersex genital surgery to show how overloaded with cultural judgment our  understanding of female genital cutting is outside of Africa. This essay does not address male genital cutting, but improving understanding of female cutting helps to show how closely related cultural genital cutting traditions are whether the child's genitals being modified are male or female (or intersex).   As many have pointed out, the mainstream anti-FGC position is premised upon an orientalizing construction of FGC societies as primitive, patriarchal, and barbaric, and of female circumcision as a harmful, unnecessary cultural practice based on patriarchal gender norms and ritualistic beliefs. In their (understandable) anxiousness to eliminate procedures that clearly cause much harm and suffering to women, mainstream opponents of female circumcision frequently lapse into an extremely “othering” and disparaging discourse. Lambasting African societies and practices (while failing to critique similar practices in the United States), mainstream North American anti-FGC discourse simultaneously constructs the United States as civilized and sexually egalitarian, and North American genital cutting as safe, scientific, and defensible.  Thus, both the cultural, socially constructed aspects of intersex treatment (usually seen as culture-free) and the heterogeneity and fluidity of FGC cultures (usually seen as monolithically patriarchal) suggest that the distinction anti-FGC activists draw between female circumcision and intersex surgery is more illusory than real. Both are harmful cultural practices of genital cutting that are debated and challenged within their own societies. This deconstruction of the two sides of the culture/science binary reveals the flaws in the idea that the FGC issue pits cultural relativism against women’s equality and health. Although the “cultural practice” rubric presents the genital cutting issue as posing a conflict between cultural relativism and feminism, a more nuanced understanding of the cultural influences on and social conflicts about both practices exposes that rubric as simplistic and orientalizing. Finally, the conclusion that intersex treatment is not neutral “science” but rather contingent cultural behavior—and that female circumcision is not cohesive cultural tradition but rather contested political practice—removes a central support for the Western/North American exceptionalism upon which anti-FGC discourse is grounded. The intersex issue reveals the influence of white privilege in the mainstream movement’s discourse.   On the one hand, the similarities between FGC and intersex cutting suggest that it would be inappropriate to subject practitioners of female circumcision to serious punishment unless one were willing to treat the practitioners of harmful genital cutting from our own society equally harshly. On the other hand, the elevated position of doctors in this society, and the assumption that most physicians performing intersex surgery are benignly motivated, make it difficult to imagine incarcerating such individuals. The intersex critique tempts one to ask, in other words, whether the same steps would have been taken to prevent FGC if it were an established medical practice in this society, rather than a rite associated with the most orientalized of continents, Africa.   Like so many other intersectional issues that appear to pit different subordinated groups against each other, the genital cutting issue (here, seeming to pit “women” against “intersexuals”) illustrates the pitfalls of narrow, group-focused activism. The “not our problem” stance taken by mainstream anti-FGC activists to the issue of intersex surgery is not an uncommon reaction by groups facing invitations to join forces with other social reform efforts. Many examples of similar refusals are well known, such as Betty Friedan’s infamous “lavender menace” dismissal of lesbian efforts to collaborate with heterosexual feminists and the Human Rights Campaign’s refusal to see racial discrimination and sex equality as relevant to the gay community. I have argued elsewhere that such narrow definitions of group interest often work to the disadvantage of identity groups. By ignoring the ways in which systems of subordination mutually reinforce each other, these “not our problem” arguments often unwittingly facilitate that reinforcement in a way that negatively affects their own efforts. Applying that insight to this context suggests that the exclusion of intersex issues from anti-FGC activism may ultimately work against the interests of that very movement, reinforcing patriarchal gender norms at home and eliciting defensive reactions to the critique of such norms abroad.  In Part II of the Article, I survey the arguments usually made against female circumcision, showing how those arguments construct such surgery as a harmful cultural (and therefore contingent) practice. In critically assessing the assumptions underlying anti-FGC discourse, I highlight the orientalist tone and exceptionalist assumptions that characterize that discourse, drawing on insights from an alternative, non-mainstream critique of FGC that has been articulated by a number of authors. I also describe the long history of the harmful cultural practice of female circumcision within the Western medical tradition. In Part III, I apply each of the anti-FGC arguments to intersex surgery and show that it, too, can be understood as a harmful cultural practice enforcing contingent, gendered (and heteronormative) cultural standards. In Part IV, I explore the policy implications of identifying both FGC and intersex surgery as harmful cultural practices. In particular, I suggest policies that address both types of surgery in a way that eliminates the harms they produce without demonizing the individuals who engage in them. Finally, in Part V, I return to the broader theoretical issues raised by the refusal of anti-FGC activists to embrace the fight against intersex surgery. I argue that this refusal both reinforces binary sex/gender norms that harm women and likely elicits defensive reactions from the very individuals whose behavior anti-FGC efforts are attempting to change. As such, this resistance to intersex reform efforts illustrates the self-defeating effect of narrowly defined, “not our problem” definitions of group interests."

Filing a complaint with the hospital doesn't feel very effective, but it could be if enough people did. Doctors and hospitals are in the best position to advance intactivism (or circumcisionism). Doctors in the US are responsible for normalizing medicalized genital modification, it is up to doctors to denormalize it now.  You can do what internet circumcision activists are doing with their anti-foreskin message, explain why consent for nontherapeutic foreskin destruction matters. That's what I try to do on this site. There's already a lot of support for body autonomy on reddit though, so it's not difficult. Still, some intactivists do this so badly, they actually work against intactivism, which makes me wonder if they're not circumcision activists. The people who explain intactivism so badly that they make the idea look ignorant shouldn't be trying to explain it.  The in-person/phone stuff should be a lot more effective for the time it takes, so I would definitely do that if I were you.

I doubt many people vote in elections because it feels effective either. People do it because it's the only thing that can be done for whatever issues they care about.  I don't understand ""rally's up ppl more"". What do you mean?  The majority of reddit opposes nontherapeutic circumcision already. This makes sense considering the demographics of reddit. There are a lot of men with intact penises on reddit especially from the rest of the world where (excluding Islam and the US) less than 5% of men have circumcised penises (WHO, 2007) and women and gay men who only know intact penises or know both and don't care or prefer intact. In North America, the US is the only country where a majority of infants are circumcised. There are a lot of redditors living in or from the more intact parts of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and anglophone Oceania where nontherapeutic foreskin excision is not normalized like it is in the US and Islam. Besides that, besides the paltry few subscribed to this subreddit, there are a few other special interest groups opposing medicalized circumcision. Men's rights is kind of big on reddit, and they view the issue as part of their narrative of disenfranchisement of men's rights. I doubt that helps intactivism with a more general audience than the internet, but we are on our side of the debate at least. Feminists who understand the issue support intactivism too. Atheism is also kind of big on reddit, and the majority would appear to view involuntary nontherapeutic genital surgery as the medicalized religious/cultural surgery it is. In 1949, an influential US atheist, Joseph Lewis wrote In the Name of Humanity: Speaking Out Against Circumcision. Many contemporary atheist thinkers have spoken out against circumcision as well. In the US, a slight majority may still favor infant surgery, but intactivism-favoring groups (intact majority of the globe, otherwise knowledgeable people and the special interest groups) might easily add up to a majority of the users on reddit.  Is it enough for reddit to be a better platform for intactivist ideas than it is for circumcisionist ideas?   Can you describe what you mean you would like to happen in any more detail?"

He's unaware the arguments presented for both are mostly identical.  Repeating a point advanced by Brian Morris, he claims the surgery has been growing more popular in the US. He doesn't understand how the surgery is performed and describes it as much less violent than it is. He appears to be unaware that the vulva is equally capable of accumulating smegma and that that argument is used to support female genital cutting as well where that is traditional and in the past in the US by advocates of medicalized female genital cutting. He is unaware that circumcision has any effect on sex or that circumcision reduces condom tolerance. He sounds idiotic suggesting the AAP continues to recommend the surgery to prevent back alley surgeries. Every comment he made about intactivists was insulting.

The host's stubborn insistence that ""nontherapeutic foreskin destruction cannot matter because it doesn't matter to me"" (to paraphrase) is exactly why doctors in the US have ignorantly maintained the circumcision tradition here while doctors in countries with greater awareness of harmful effects of the surgery abandoned their medicalized cutting traditions decades ago (like Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand).  This is a pretty good example of the subtle sort of culturally-programmed circumcision advocacy/activism that maintains cutting for those for whom stronger reasons for cutting are not more appealing."
Intactivists,3alqoa,dalkon,7,Sun Jun 21 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I find it sickening.  The inexcusable and illogical CDC statement being misconstrued makes me feel so bad for the victims."
Intactivists,3alqoa,6658,7,Mon Jun 22 05:13:09 2015 UTC,Do you have an example of propaganda?
Intactivists,3alqoa,prototype137,7,Sun Jun 21 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"The history of circumcision activism has been pretty dense since the 1890s. One of the more recent additions to the circumcision propaganda narrative is that circumcision prevents HIV, which was first advanced in the 1980s and then promoted in earnest after 2005 with the misleading African RCTs designed to demonstrate the effect of behavioral counseling and therapeutic or semi-therapeutic foreskin excision as an effect of nontherapeutic foreskin excision. The 1980s also saw Wiswell's exaggerated infant UTI statistics. From the 1950s to the '70s, the focus was on pathologizing the foreskin as adversely affecting women's health. Before that it was anti-masturbation rhetoric and misunderstanding and pathologizing developmental phimosis.  * One particularly harmful point that circumcision propagandists have advanced recently is the research demonstrating circumcision does not reduce condom use that consisted of nothing more than surveying African men about whether they used condoms before and after circumcision. Those surveys are pure circumcision propaganda. They are contradicted by many news reports (e.g., 2012 Zimbabwe, 2012 Malawi, 2013 Botswana, 2013 Kenya, 2013 Israel, 2013 Zimbabwe, 2014 Nigeria, 2014 Uganda), the reports of African prostitutes (Abbott, 2013), Australian college students (Bensley & Boyle, 2001), a New Zealand prostitute who recorded statistics about her clients, an study of men visiting STD clinics in the US (Crosby & Charnigo, 2013), and many other studies that have found that circumcision was correlated with not using condoms as much. This false propaganda that circumcision does not reduce condom use obviously has harmful consequences in promoting STD transmission and unwanted pregnancies.  Does disinformation like this make you think circumcision activism is disgraceful?"
Intactivists,3alqoa,prototype137,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure what you meant by propaganda. I've never seen ads or flyers promoting circumcision. Not saying they don't exist.  As for the link, I think it's helpful to divide it into ignorance and stupidity. I can forgive the ignorance. Parents who have their kids cut because somebody told them it was a good thing, he wasn't going to feel it, etc. probably did what they did because they wanted what was best for their child. It's a tradition ingrained in American culture, and most people will go along with it. As a medical student, I extend this to health care professionals given the fact that at least I have yet to receive any education on foreskin aside from there or not. The extent of education is ""some parents elect to have this procedure done, do it and get paid."" My boyfriend and I had a conversation about this actually; he had phimosis that he attributed to forced retraction by his pediatrician. He told me that it sucks that it happened, but he doesn't fault his doctor because he didn't know not to do that.   Then there are those who have been told the truth about circumcision. The CDC and AAP come to mind. The people and organizations who know the statistics and manipulate them to fit their cause fall into this category. As do the people who are informed of the risks and damage caused, and still claim it should be left to the parents. Also, the people who think the most important thing is that the son looks like his dad, or that all other points are moot because they're fine with their penises. These people and their propaganda I find disgraceful."

I was a mean motherfucker when I was 14. By the time I was 16, I could have handled 3 of my 14-year-old selves.   And anyone (or any group) that was physically able to cut me would not have survived after I finished recuperating.   I'm surprised that we don't hear about forced circumcision retribution murders in South Africa. Maybe I'm just from a different culture, but I'm pretty sure that if in America we did to teens what we do to babies, we'd have a lot of dead circumcisers.   As it is, they hide behind the veil of infancy."
Intactivists,3ag8o7,skintact81,3,Sat Jun 20 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"That's hardly bravery. It's not even foolhardiness like you meant. It is unfortunately more like social normalization or maybe even cultural righteousness.  The victims usually want to be modified, because they have been misled to believe it will make them men. That doesn't appear to be the case here, but that must have been what the kidnappers thought at least. Cutters have a lot of cultural ideas supporting them like the idea that the victims are not victims because the ritual confers manhood.  It's interesting to note that pervasive cultural denigration of the foreskin maintains this support for genital cutting in exactly the same way that pervasive cultural denigration of parts of the vulva maintain traditional female genital cutting where genital cutting traditions are unisex. In the US, people ignorantly assume that not only the foreskin is useless but that the foreskin must be as bad as would be necessary to justify infant genital surgery. They mistakenly believe that assessment is universal. They have no awareness how similar their ideas are to cultures that cut girls too for the same ideas about various parts of the vulva.  If you did seek violent revenge for traditional surgery, you wouldn't be the first. A man murdered the proprietor of a circumcision initiation camp in 2013. Motive was not clear, but news that triggered the murder may have been the recent reports that the death toll was up to 27 for the area from initiations.   More peacefully, a tiny measure of legal justice has been obtained on victims' behalf in some cases. South African prosecutors charged cutters with ""contravening the Children's Act"" and ""culpable murder"" (manslaughter) for maiming and killing boys last year. Really very little has been done for the thousands of victims of traditional circumcision. There have been hundreds of deaths and mutilations (beyond foreskin excision itself).  Men who were the most victimized by the surgery are unfortunately often ostracized for it as if the victims were responsible for mutilating themselves. In this way, the victims, both living and dead, are denied any ability to criticize the tradition. In one case last year, a man was beaten just for trying to talk about his mutilation at a community meeting about it.  Ostracizing victims is part of the circumcision propaganda that's been popular in Africa since African tribal circumcision activists pushed the idea of circumcision defining manhood. This may have always been an idea in certain groups but appears to have begun to be promoted more widely and actively in the 1980s which would curiously appear to be concurrent with US circumcision activists first claims about circumcision to prevent HIV."

Intactivists,3ag3un,not_shadowbanned_yet,10,Sat Jun 20 02:17:42 2015 UTC,Any gratuitous medical procedure forcefully imposed on anyone is mutilation.
Intactivists,3ag3un,thecritic06,-3,Sat Jun 20 09:16:21 2015 UTC,"Any gratuitous medical procedure forcefully imposed on anyone is mutilation.   That's not a very meaningful definition of mutilation, is it? A mutilation is more than merely unwarranted (gratuitous), isn't it?   A mutilation is either (notably) destructive or at least disfiguring if non-destructive. I consider nontherapeutic foreskin excision mutilation categorically because a part of the body is not just damaged, marked or pierced, it is destroyed. Permanently marking (like tattoos and scarification) or piercing an infant are unethical body modifications (with a singular odd exception for ear piercing for a minority). Foreskin excision is more destructive than those body modifications that are not just obviously unethical but illegal in much or most of the world.   Not only is the foreskin excised, but the use of a tissue-crushing clamp to limit bleeding to allow more destructive surgery also makes the surgery more painful and makes the scar more prominent. If tradition did not normalize it, male genital cutting would probably seem very similar to FGC in being seen as mutilation in more than just an empty technical sense. If we were talking about performing primarily aesthetic genital skin excision on girls, everyone would be talking about how the clamp and lack of anesthesia make the surgery essentially torture.  The only way foreskin excision could be considered non-mutilating would be to consider the foreskin to be something other than a normal functional part of the body. For instance, circumcising cultures view the foreskin as if it were a universal birth defect rather than a functional part of the body, and circumcising religions may define the foreskin as an ""impediment"" in order to define foreskin destruction as perfection rather than mutilation.  Colloquially mutilation is a more subjective question though because one man's mutilation can be another's cherished adornment. Personally I avoid calling anyone mutilated because the colloquial definition of mutilation is so subjective. The question of mutilation is probably best left to a body's owner to determine. Men who did not want to be circumcised are entitled to consider themselves mutilated, a significant part of their bodies was destroyed. For the men who do not feel mutilated, there's no reason I should think they should. That's why I generally ignore the question of mutilation when I'm trying to be persuasive and focus on describing the destruction the surgery entails. For persuasive purposes, it's best to leave it to others to judge the surgery to be mutilation or not for themselves."
Intactivists,3ag3un,thecritic06,5,Sun Jun 21 13:37:41 2015 UTC,"Whilst I appreciate your extensive post, I stand by my definition. Certainly a person has the choice to do what they want to their bodies, and view their bodies however they like. But as a legal definition of the word, I think mine is comprehensive enough to function very well. Anything forced upon a person is destructive to them in some regard, physical, mental or emotional, and without clear defensible justification for doing so, I'd say that it does constitute mutilation."
Intactivists,3ag3un,Ciderglove,5,Sun Jun 21 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"In the overwhelming majority of cases, yes."
Intactivists,3ag3un,futureruins,3,Sat Jun 20 12:02:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely.
Intactivists,3ag3un,Black_caped_man,3,Sat Jun 20 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia:   Mutilation or maiming is an act of physical injury that degrades the appearance or function of any living body.   From Merriam-Webster:    to cut up or alter radically so as to make imperfect to cut off or permanently destroy a limb or essential part of [something]    From Oxford Dictionary Online:    Inflict a violent and disfiguring injury on: Inflict serious damage on:    Definition of Disfigure:   To spoil the appearance of:   Definition of Spoil (in context):   To diminish or destroy the value or quality of.   There is no arguing that circumcision is an act of physical injury (it's amputation of healthy tissue and leaves a scar), and to ""degrade the appearance of"" is pretty much synonymous with disfigurement.  The foreskin is the most touch sensitive area of the male body, it contains around 10X as many specialized fine touch nerve receptors as your fingertips. Here is a good explanation of the functionality of the foreskin and the anatomy of the penis.  Given the above I don't see any way in which cutting off the foreskin is not degrading the function of the penis.  What you do in a circumcision is quite literally to ""cut up"" and ""alter radically"" (remember it removes about 50% of the skin of the penis) the penis so as to make imperfect. I'll point you to the quote by Moses Maimonides (a Jewish rabbi, physician and philosopher 1135-1204):   Similarly with regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible.   Even the staunch practitioners of circumcision at that age were aware of it's effects on sexual sensation. This together with the facts given above constitutes to me undeniable proof that circumcision does indeed render the penis ""imperfect"", though the word is still a subjective one.  By now the oxford definition should be pretty clear as well. weather violent or not can of course be argued since the initial intent was to damage the penis though today that is not often the intent. Still it's undeniable that it inflicts serious damage on the penis.    So by three different definitions of the word mutilation circumcision aligns with all of them. Therefore I see no reason at all to deny that male circumcision is male genital mutilation by the very definition of the words themselves.  Any amputation when not done by medical necessity is considered mutilation of the body.  I rest my case."
Intactivists,3ag3un,SocietalDisgrace,3,Sun Jun 21 16:36:43 2015 UTC,Yes by definition it is. You are removing totally healthy and functional skin for no immediate medical reason other than aesthetics.
Intactivists,3ag3un,NotYoursToCut,3,Mon Jun 22 23:05:39 2015 UTC,"Of course.  We've defined FGM as an excision of tissue from the female genitals apart from true medical need and apart from the individual's consent, even if that individual is an infant or child whose parents retain general decision-making power over them.  Why, then, shouldn't MGM be defined as an excision of tissue from the male genitals apart from true medical need and apart from the individual's consent, even if that individual is an infant or child whose parents retain general decision-making power over them?  Why even genderize it into ""female"" or ""male"" in the first place?  Genital mutilation: excising tissue from the genitals apart from true medical need and apart from the individual's consent, even if that individual is an infant or child whose parents retain general decision-making power over them.  There."
Intactivists,3ag3un,Spoonwood,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, and more.  Many circumcisions involve a gomco clamp or another clamp where the penis is forcibly made to penetrate the object which does the cutting.  In other terms, it envelops the penis.  Circumcision is thus quite literally rape (though not in the legal sense of the term, since legal definitions of rape usually included a vagina getting penetrated by an object, but they exclude a penis getting made to penetrate an object)."

To add to History of Circumcision's post, here's a brief note on the paper from Texas State Journal of Medicine (p. 370, upper left corner). Female circumcision, in this paper--argued by doctors, can alleviate the buildup of smegma, which causes masturbation, and can cure bed wetting.   https://books.google.com/books?id=KaREAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA370&lpg=PA370&dq=why+not+circumcise+the+girl+as+well+as+the+boy&source=bl&ots=C0yLk6l9dy&sig=OMbblSNNo2O6n1yEMdf1z2ZSsWs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCkQ6AEwBWoVChMI_4-eqMiUxgIVhjGMCh3jTgBW#v=onepage&q=why%20not%20circumcise%20the%20girl%20as%20well%20as%20the%20boy&f=false"
Intactivists,39vp3d,dalkon,10,Mon Jun 15 04:35:29 2015 UTC,"What really gets me about this case is the part of the doctors, nurses, hospitals, and anyone else in the medical side of things that went along with it. I'm not in law, and I don't know the intricacies of how this case unfolds with them, but medically   A patient has bodily autonomy, and this overrides pretty much anything else. In the case of a minor, the legal guardians assume this right and responsibility.  Underlying autonomy, any patient must give fully informed consent to any procedure except in certain circumstances such as life-saving measures or when the patient loses competence in which case things get even trickier. In Chase's case, the mother claims she signed the parental agreement without being informed of the risks, thus she could not have given informed consent to the procedure.  Even if she was fully informed, it doesn't matter because prior consent does not imply current consent. A patient, or in this case guardian, has the unquestionable right to revoke consent to any procedure up until it begins. A 68 year old man can literally be on the operating table for a pacemaker operation that was planned for two years, and suddenly decide he doesn't want it, and at that point it cannot be done and to do it would be considered malpractice because the team would have violated his bodily autonomy.  Heather Hironimus refused to consent to the procedure, kidnapped her son, and only consented when she was handcuffed, shackled, and threatened with ""indefinite jailtime."" Personally that sounds questionable against the 8th amendment, but the fact is she was obviously coerced into consenting. This is not valid. Much like sex, you can't threaten somebody, get them drunk, etc and claim they fully consented to it. I don't know why she would have had to if the judge gave the father full rights, but it was necessary for her to consent then there was none.  Despite the differences we may have with the AAP, they do have a statement and precedence that for cosmetic procedures with no medical benefit, BOTH parents must consent as opposed to medically beneficial procedures where consent of one parent is sufficient. In addition, they do assert some issue with performing procedures on nonconsenting minors even though they don't possess competence."
Intactivists,39vp3d,zimmer199,5,Mon Jun 15 14:53:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Unfortunately US law does not define body autonomy as a right. Instead this pseudo-right is maintained by the fact that unwanted touching including surgery is the crime of battery and maiming is mayhem. Circumcision has been considered criminal in cases where someone medically unqualified also botched the surgery.   Much like sex, you can't threaten somebody, get them drunk, etc and claim they fully consented to it.   Much like sex, prior contractual obligation should not override actual consent (in this case parental but ideally it should be personal)."

Intactivists,39vp3d,faux_real_now,6,Mon Jun 15 21:55:29 2015 UTC,"I've had issues with this case from day one. As soon as intactivists got involved a whole narrative was created that the mom was some angelic supermom, the dad was a vindictive miscreant, and the judge was a misogynist who was abusing his authority.   Now personally, I think there are few things more repulsive than outsiders inserting themselves into a family court case and in this case we can see why. Clearly this case features two ridiculous and petty parents who BOTH signed a parenting plan to have the kid circumcised when he was 2 years old. 2 YEARS OLD!!! This to me shows how messed up BOTH of them are.   This narrative cooked up is not supported by any evidence other than the mom's word. The accusations of misogyny distracted and detracted from the main point of saving the boy from harm.   Lastly, I firmly believe that this case would have gone much differently if the mother hadn't decided that she was going to defy a family court judge by releasing the boy's name, image, and likeness and then continuing to solicit outside help. I am not sure who on god's green earth thinks they are going to have a favorable court outcome when you defy and then demonize a sitting judge who has complete control over the future of your family.   With all that said I hope with every fiber of my being that somehow that boys stays safe and sound, but I am very bitter and very disappointed how this entire case was handled. All the mom and her lawyers managed to do was to lay out a clear case that circumcising infants is somehow better than doing it to 4 year olds and just think of the field day the pro cutters will have if this boy gets mutilated and goes on to live a normal life. That means that all the dire warnings and grave predictions about the risk (while true) will look insignificant in the court of public opinion.   My last thought here: Do you know why her lawyer withdrew the federal lawsuit? Because he smartly realized that the entire case was argued wrongly and that the most likely outcome from any federal ruling would be a win for pro cutters. This should be a clear indication of just how poorly the mom and her lawyers conducted themselves during this case that they actually FEARED a federal judge ruling on the merits and withdrew the case, but not before the judge attached prejudice meaning that this case cannot be argued again in federal court.   So there you have it. From start to finish this is a case study in how NOT to handle a family court case and of course the only person that will suffer is a little boy.  Fuck."
Intactivists,39vp3d,k_kat,7,Mon Jun 15 23:54:22 2015 UTC,"After following this case for a while and being the mom of a young boy myself I feel I can put myself in her shoes a little bit. She may not be a perfect supermom, but the urge to protect her kids above all else is real and she is demonstrating that in spades."
Intactivists,39vp3d,faux_real_now,4,Tue Jun 16 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's a terrible summary of the case.   The judge chose to consider contractual obligations and chose to consider child circumcision an unquestionably appreciated body modification as if a significant minority of men do not resent their involuntary nontherapeutic circumcisions.   It's understandable why he avoided considering the enforceability of a circumcision contract, as a judge it was easier for him to ignore that question. A circumcised man in a circumcising culture would prefer to assume foreskin excision is universally appreciated as if that appreciation were not supported by the ignorance that routine infant body modification creates.  I think the biggest problem with this case was that the mother chose inadequate representation for the trial and appeal, she only got a lawyer capable of arguing her case after the judge had decided everything and she was just trying to fight the decisions that had already been made.   The worst aspect of this case is that this is the case that has drawn the most attention of all these cases. In four other states when lawsuits have resulted from parental disagreement about cutting a child's penis, in every case, courts have decided that when parents disagree, the decision should fall to the child when he is capable of making it. Even when the surgery has been considered therapeutic, courts have avoided forcing court-ordered surgery on anyone. Have you ever heard of these other circumcision cases?   NJ 2001: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/us/25brfs-003.html?_r=0 MO, 2004: http://web.archive.org/web/20041029070148/http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/9359979.htm IL, 2006: http://www.reuters.com/article/2006/10/25/us-life-circumcision-idUSN2425381320061025 OR, 2008: http://blog.oregonlive.com/breakingnews/2008/05/dad_appeals_teen_sons_circumci.html   In that Oregon case, the father was not only denied his request to force genital surgery on his 13 year-old by the Oregon Supreme Court, he also eventually lost custody to the mother (who had previously retained no custody rights) for his attempt to force ""elective"" surgery on their son.  Why didn't any of those cases get much media attention?  These other cases were all different for just being disagreements between parents without any question about a contractual obligation, but the prevailing legal opinions in all those cases were against forcing elective surgery on children when parents disagreed. Even when therapeutic, doctors have opposed court-ordered surgery especially genital surgery. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both stated opposition to any court-ordered medical treatment during that 2001 case in New Jersey."
Intactivists,39vp3d,faux_real_now,5,Tue Jun 16 04:23:57 2015 UTC,"Most people haven't heard of those cases because one of the parents didn't decide to turn the proceedings into a shit show. That's my entire point. In these cases both the boys' bodies and identities were protected and things were much less personal adversarial.   I'm not sure what about my statement makes it a ""terrible summary"" but I've been on this sub long enough to know that if you didn't write it, you'll more often than not find some way to shit on someone else's comment. But whatever, I stand by what I wrote. I study law and I have also had the severe displeasure of being involved in several family court cases. Not one action taken by the mother or her attorneys made sense or even seemed to be part of a strategy. The entire case centered around the medical necessity of a procedure in a culture that doesn't require medical necessity to be performed. Furthermore the cases you cited may not necessarily have any binding precedent for a Florida state court so the contract enforcement angle may not have had any real teeth either.  Bottom line: if you don't want your kid circumcised, don't agree to it. Especially not on paper. Also, a bit of advice to the intactivists who plastered their Facebook and Twitter feeds with pictures of that boy from Florida, if consent means anything to you, you'd stop using that boy's name and picture since there is no way that he or his mom can consent to his information being used in a worldwide campaign."
Intactivists,39vp3d,faux_real_now,3,Tue Jun 16 06:17:52 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things that I don't like about this case too. To reiterate, the biggest problem with it all was that the mother chose inadequate representation through all the original proceedings until after the appeal denial. She only got better representation later when it didn't matter as much. I don't understand her choice at all. I complained about her lawyer choice before the appeal. But it is also very difficult to blame her for that bad decision. She made other choices that were also bad, but I don't think any of those was as bad as the Judge Gillen's decision to enforce a contractually obligated child body modification.  I don't agree with using the child's likeness either.  If you agree on paper to have sex with people, they couldn't then force you to have sex with them because that's not an enforceable contract. Other body modification contracts would be held to the same standard whether therapeutic or nontherapeutic. Why is this child body modification being held to a different standard?"
Intactivists,39vp3d,faux_real_now,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:35:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I'm not saying that the contract enforcement is a dead end. I'm saying that in a cutting culture comparing proxy consent for a ""medicalized"" procedure to sex or body mod is a tough sell. Furthermore as long as the procedure is culturally considered therapeutic (though we know that to be false) undoing proxy consent rights for parents could have untold implications on parental rights for choosing legitimate health/medical options for a minor in parenting plans and divorce decrees.   Also, I don't blame the mother either. It's the father who is insistent upon having this done. The entire affair has been a travesty. A judge was made to feel insulted and ignored and while I disagree with a judge's ability to take a case personally, I think it's legal suicide to antagonize a judge. They have immense power and their decisions are not easily overruled."
Intactivists,39vp3d,futureruins,2,Tue Jun 16 06:50:18 2015 UTC,"No, making nontherapeutic body modification voluntary will not affect any normal therapeutic or preventative medical options.

Many medical organizations already recommend that parental preference should not be considered sufficient reason for nontherapeutic genital modification.

Calm down with the drama and the bullshit premises. I should have known better than to engage you on here. Your comments are almost always petty, shallow, and full of mischaracterization of other people's comments.   Just because YOU think that a court decision will not affect proxy consent means nothing. I simply said that there are possible implications (especially as they relate to contracts and parenting plans) on other areas of consent if the courts get involved. That's not circ propaganda, that's fact. Legal decisions IN ANY ARENA can have unintended consequences that's why people who try to use the courts to strike a blow against circ better have their shit together before they decide to make a case out of something. That's my point.   You seem to think you've got this contract argument all locked up, but health considerations in parenting plans and divorce decrees are very common. While it may be easy for people like you or me to understand that there is nothing medical or therapeutic about circ, the cutting culture we live does believe it's a medical procedure. That is where the danger comes in. Unless a court were to carve circ out of the realm of culturally normal medical decisions the implications that I mentioned are very real. No amount of your snark or hyperbole changes that.  I hope perhaps you understand how insulting it is to tell/accuse a person who is highly resentful of the fact that he was mutilated as a baby that he is spreading circ propaganda when he is simply trying to engage in a conversation.

Intactivists,38ah04,Cantioy87,13,Tue Jun 2 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"Of course online polls as informal as those on blogs like these certainly aren't reliable enough to make much of an argument, but I thought it was interesting.   So, is your penis circumcised? 45% 5,045 votes - I don’t have a penis! 27% 3,027 votes - Yes, and I’m glad. 14% 1,599 votes - No, and I’m glad. 11% 1,253 votes - Yes, but I wish it wasn’t. 3% 346 votes - No, but I wish it was.     According to those numbers, 29% of the men who were circumcised were displeased while 18% of the men with intact foreskin were displeased. In other words, the odds parents chose irreversible foreskin excision that was ultimately unwanted was 64% higher than the odds someone would grow up to regret having to choose for himself.  A man displeased with his foreskin has a range of options available to him. A man displeased with his circumcision can only create a crude facsimile if his penile anatomy is capable of skin expansion and he adheres to a tensioning regimen for months to years. That's a large part of why the surgery is unethical. It's impossible to un-excise the foreskin."
Intactivists,38ah04,dalkon,4,Wed Jun 3 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"Excellent perspective. Thanks. Informal studies are better than no studies.

This video at least provides information for those looking to restore, which is a positive step toward recognizing routine infant genital cutting as a problem. The poll also suggests (as of now) a 27% satisfaction with cutting done to participants versus 25% happy with being intact and cut but wish wasn't. Those figures suggest an appreciation for genital integrity."
Intactivists,38ah04,TorontoIntactivist,3,Wed Jun 3 01:53:54 2015 UTC,Yes but the actual quality of the article? That graph with exactly two data points and an animation spoke volumes in and of itself.
Intactivists,38ah04,k_kat,3,Wed Jun 3 02:00:41 2015 UTC,You're right. I can't defend Buzzfeed's quality of work all the time. Buzzfeed reaches many people. That someone at Buzzfeed would report positively on foreskin regeneration to any large audience is appreciated. Quality issues aside.
Intactivists,38ah04,underatreeoverahill,3,Wed Jun 3 02:04:58 2015 UTC,I think right now any publicity is good publicity. Anything that gets people to give the issue of circumcision a second thought. Doctors don't want the public to pay attention. A pro-circumcision stance is untenable when men start to speak up and the horrors of it are exposed to the light of day.
Intactivists,38ah04,underatreeoverahill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"Discussions that take place on sites and forums accessed by a variety of people also help. When circumcision is a hidden issue talked about in niche circles (like this one), that's a start to something better--discussions taking place where people who flippantly (because they don't know any better) consider circumcision have to see that there are points being raised against it, points that have substance stronger than, ""because it's the right thing to do."""

Pretty much what happened in Egypt.  But I guess there has to be some first step.  I do think that changing the culture could happen quickly, if the right resources are used.  I think there are some lessons to learn from the pro circumcision movement in Africa as to how social change can happen relatively quickly.  Changing minds with facts doesn't work nearly as well as appeals to vanity, songs on the radio, etc."
Intactivists,389y30,forwardseat,2,Wed Jun 3 12:42:45 2015 UTC,I disagree with your idea that facts don't convince people. Most people are more reasonable than you imagine. They're just ignorant about the issue.

I've come to seriously believe that getting the hottest heartthrob in the country to be on posters saying ""I prefer whole women"" would be more effective than ""this damages women's fertility and kills x number of girls per year.""

They can be lost causes.).   As Dalkon suggests, there are those who will change their minds after learning more, especially in regards to infant genital cutting (and genital cutting in general). Those are the people who will further the intactivist movement, the people who are given and accept a new perspective."

FGM is performed in a minority of countries, yet it gets almost all of the attention when it comes to genital mutilation, even though MGM occurs 10x more frequently. It's really frustrating how little people care about boys' genital integrity"
Intactivists,389y30,throwaway136529,3,Wed Jun 3 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"Most people don't know how similar male and female genital cutting can be. They overestimate the extent of the more common female cutting traditions. They're not aware how many female genital cuttings leave no detectable trace of surgery on the vulva. People also underestimate the effect of foreskin excision. Information corrects this ignorance, but it takes time for information to progress through culture. That's what we see with the delay to condemn all genital mutilation, both Nigeria's delay until now in banning female cutting and the continued delay to recognize the massive violation in nontherapeutic foreskin excision.   It's understandable why you would be jealous of the recognition the issue gets when it comes to girls when so many people are still promoting the mutilation to which you were subjected, but this is how progress occurs. It's slow.  Focusing on the positive isn't just good for your outlook. It should help you be able to explain (unisex) intactivism better."
Intactivists,389y30,throwaway136529,2,Thu Jun 4 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"People have said that I make ppl distance themselves from me when I start to argue that FGM and MGM are ethically comparable, and they start to ignore my views. And in reality, I should probably not do that so that they at least recognize that what we do to boys is genital mutilation. But ffs come on, mutilation is mutilation!"
Intactivists,389y30,throwaway136529,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:43:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe ask them to tell YOU how they are different. But first, have them assume that we're going to legalize FGM briefly so it can be done in sterile hospitals so that the girls get the same safety measures as the boys.

Intactivists,389y30,StarHarvest,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"Their answer is that in the case of FGM, it removes the clitoris and sews up the vagina. I'm simply tired of hearing this when it's not true. Yes that does happen in some countries that practice FGM, but not all. Even when I do show them how they are similar, they either ignore me or say that I'm making others ignore me for taking such an extreme stance. Here's an example"
Intactivists,389y30,TomwaIvory,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:25:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know. I've had that discussion. A different approach would be, I think, to ask what parts of the vulva should be mutilated or removed to cause damage commensurate to that of a standard USA-style male circumcision. Make them at least consider that.   Then ask what percentage of the genital nerve endings is lost in each of those two procedures, because that, to me, is where the real quantifiable aspects can be talked about. Some people just need it to be hammered into them with numbers."
Intactivists,389y30,Cantioy87,2,Fri Jun 5 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I agree with that method. I mean, who cares if there's more nerve endings? Are you sure it directly correlates with pain? Also, how can you be so sure that MGM cuts more nerves than an FGM procedure which is equally damaging? And how would I find data for that?"

Intactivists,3816ud,TorontoIntactivist,-2,Tue Jun 2 17:17:29 2015 UTC,I think Its more hygienic and also has medical purposes?
Intactivists,3816ud,mariaaax23,4,Wed Jun 3 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"Male and female genitalia are alike in many respects. The vulva can be destructively modified to simplify hygiene too. And like the penis, in some cases the vulva may need surgery to correct some disease or innate anatomical defect (therapeutic medical purposes). None of this justifies involuntary nontherapeutic genital modification for either sex.  Did you know that female prepucectomy was being promoted in the early 20th century for the same reasons as male circumcision? Fortunately it never became as popular as male circumcision, but most medical professionals considered it as ethical as male circumcision until around the 1970s. Here are some original sources about medicalized female circumcision in the US from /r/intactivists/wiki:history of medicalized genital cutting:   Kellogg, John Harvey. Plain Facts for Old and Young. F. Segner & Co. 1881. Pratt, Edwin Hartley. Circumcision of Girls. J Orificial Surgery. 1898. Freeman, Rowland. Circumcision in Masturbation in Female Infants. Am J of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children. 1914. Dawson, Benjamin E. Circumcision in the Female: Its Necessity and How to Perform It. Am J Clin Med. 1915. Eskridge, Belle. Why not circumcise the girl as well as the boy? Texas State J Med. 1918.   If you think involuntary nontherapeutic male circumcision (prepucectomy/posthectomy) is permissible for hygiene, why is female prepucectomy (circumcision) impermissible?"

The ostensible benefits are almost identical to the supposed benefits of MGM (protection against HPV, HIV, UTIs, cleanliness, smell, looks nicer), and the harms and risks are dismissed or ignored just as those of MGM are in places where that is customary."
Intactivists,3816ud,novice_at_life,6,Mon Jun 15 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"No, no and no, it's not more hygienic, the foreskin doesn't even retract for many years after birth, so by leaving it intact it will prevent all of the bodily waste inside the diaper from getting inside, the infant has more of chance of the circumcision wound becoming infected than he does with his foreskin intact.  After it starts retracting, yes he may need to wash more thoroughly, but that's about as hard as teaching him to wash behind his ears (maybe we should surgically remove those as well, for hygiene and all).  All of the ""medical benefits"" are minimal at best and not worth the risks involved. There is more chance of the baby having severe reactions to the circumcision itself than any ""benefits"" he's supposed to be getting out of it."

Additionally, a series of surveys found that intact boys in the state are not more likely to be picked on. Kids are gonna pick on each other, if not about one thing than about another.  Either way, it needs the consent of both parents. You hold all the cards in this situation, if you say no, its no. End of story.

Where are these people now? Why has no one started a protest about this extreme disregard for basic human rights? How can you force something onto someone and think it's okay?  This is just nightmare material for me. My biggest fear is getting strapped down to a table and having part of my dick cut off because 'it's for the best'. I'm already circumcised, but I keep having these thoughts. I'm pretty sure I was circumcised as a child and not an infant because I can remember a moment in my life where I was on a table with extreme pain in my crotch area.

Intactivists,36wy2s,BaronVonWasteland,6,Fri May 22 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"Things are going VERY poorly for Chase and his mom.   From the article:  Please focus on sending a letter to every pediatric urologic surgeon in YOUR area and tell your friends to do so in their cities/states so not one potential performing doctor is left out.  EXAMPLE TEMPLATE (Feel free to copy, paste, and amend as desired):  To [INSERT DOCTOR’S TITLE AND NAME]:  I have great concern for a young child named Chase Nebus-Hironimus regarding the matter of his forced circumcision.  Hon. Judge Jeffery Dana Gillen has ruled that Chase may be circumcised per a prior parental agreement made when he was a baby. I believe the agreement is irrelevant now that Chase is 4.5 years old — old enough that he has verbalized he does NOT want to be circumcised. Unfortunately, he was not given the chance to defend himself in court and now he stands at imminent risk of undergoing this permanent procedure against his will and best interest.  I hope you will strongly consider a few points before facilitating a circumcision for Chase (should he be accepted as your client) under mistaken assumptions that it would be beneficial, without significant risk, psychologically benign, or medically warranted.  First, no medical organization in the world recommends circumcision, including the American Academy of Pediatrics [1a, b]. The testifying urologist in Chase’s case, Dr. Charles E. Flack, opined on May 9th, 2014 that the procedure is not medically necessary.  As you know, a doctor should — by ethical and standard protocol — receive consent and approval from the owner of the body before performing any non-emergency medical procedure, circumcision notwithstanding [2].  In situations like this we must refer back to the Hippocratic Oath: “First do no harm” [3]. Circumcision, especially on a perfectly healthy 4.5-year-old, is not medically necessary OR beneficial. The purported benefits of circumcision — lower risk of UTIs (which can be treated with antibiotics) and lower risk of penile cancer (which is more rare than breast cancer in men) [4a, b] — are insignificant and do NOT outweigh the many common short-term and long-term risks [5a, b].  The foreskin is an incredibly valuable organ with more than a dozen unique functions serving anatomical, sexual, hygienic, protective and other purposes [6]. It is not vestigial tissue.  It’s also important to understand the condition called phimosis, which is not diagnosable in a child who is Chase’s age as it is a CONGENITAL and NORMAL state of the penis, therefore it is NOT a condition requiring treatment of any kind. True phimosis at an age when the foreskin should be naturally retractible can be treated without invasive, permanent removal of the foreskin (Dr. Flack confirmed in one hearing that Chase is not affected by this) [7].  We must also evaluate Chase’s personal physical fitness to undergo a circumcision at his age. I implore you to thoroughly review Chase’s medical history, specifically with regard to keloid scarring and tolerance of general anesthesia, when evaluating benefit-to-risk ratio for him [see attachment below, 10].  Perhaps most importantly, psychologists recommend young children who undergo traumatic surgery should have counseling to look for signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to help them cope with mourning the loss of an amputated body part [8a, b]. This would undoubtedly be a tremendous emotional and mental assault as much as physical – an avoidable suffering that no child should have to endure.  Today there are many men who were once children just like Chase. They feel violated and angry that they weren’t given a voice about being circumcised. Likewise, their loved ones are just as horrified that the harm has affected their relationships and feelings of being able to protect them as they deserve [9].  Chase deserves to have a voice in the matter of keeping all of his perfectly healthy, valuable and multi-functional body parts. I hope you agree, and will not only refuse to perform this harmful procedure but also use your educated position to inform your peers.  If you have any further questions, feel free to email SavingSons@gmail.com.  Thank you for your attention and time, [INSERT YOUR NAME]"

I shared my story, how l convinced my wife to change her mind only after our son was born and when the procedure was scheduled got the next morning. I laid with her and our brand new baby boy in the hospital bed and we listened to a CD I had prepared for her. It just so happened that she had asked for ""amazing"" by Bruno Mars to be on the disc, and as the song played and we held our son together l tearfully looked from him to my wife and I asked her if she really believes he is anything but amazing, just the way he is.  That did it. The dam of social pressure and cultural norms gave way to the power of her maternal instinct and love for our perfect, tiny baby boy. She cried for a while after realizing what she had almost done and she called the nurse to cancel the appointment."

Intactivists,36ss4a,snargletron,3,Fri May 22 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"This.  As a mother, holding my precious, perfect son, I wanted nothing more than to protect him from needless pain.  I so often wonder how mothers can let this happen to their boys.  I think it is different for the father's who are cut - overcoming the differences and not having the maternal feels (SO many hormones!).  This was wonderful to read."
Intactivists,36ss4a,throwaloop,2,Fri May 22 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I think circumcision really harms women/mothers.  It just adds to the medicalization and loss of control many of us experience in regards to childbirth.  It further disempowers mothers, doctors and the prevailing culture ""force"" many to disregard their instincts, and do something that most mothers know (in the pit of their stomachs) to be not quite right, in favor of the ""we know best for you.""  I'm not wording that very well, but I think in addition to all the ""reasons"" circumcision persists, there's an undercurrent to the procedure that is very much about ignoring mothers' feelings and instincts and disrupting their relationship with their sons.  Like, at its roots, circumcision says to mothers ""men are in control here""  I really think as more and more women pursue babymaking with the idea that it is not a medical emergency and they can be more in control of it, you'll see less and less circumcision.  I'm not a crunchy granola homebirth advocate type, I just think the two things are related."

No one discussed pros and cons with me, yet 7 different people asked in a panic if we realized he hadn't been circumcised yet!  Even the nurse discharging us gasped as she was giving him a last exam before leaving, and said he hasn't had his circumcision yet!   If I ever have another baby, and he's a boy, I plan to make large signs, including one for outside the room to spark interest in other mothers."

Intactivists,36sech,k_kat,10,Thu May 21 19:12:33 2015 UTC,"How long have you been at this?   I've been solidly researching, speaking out against and raising awareness about circumcision for coming on 3 years now. I had considered circumcision in passing previously, but only in the past couple years matured into my present day thoughts about it.    How long do you realistically think it will be till we see the end of genital cutting in the U.S.?   It's tough to say. At least a couple decades. The reason for this is tied to how this practice is perpetuated in the first place; by forcing it onto children before they know the difference. This is really critical to circumcisions survival as a cultural ritual. If you deny a person an entire experience, they're going to adapt to life not knowing that experience. Further, society has set up a social narrative where critical thought or discussion about circumcision is actively suppressed and stifled.  Think about it; we're never told what was done to us, every circumcised guy has to find out on his own. It's never explained why it's done, or what the differences might be. Sex education is laughably absent, and the intact male anatomy is suppressed and actively removed from that curriculum. This creates an echo chamber where you are never exposed to pro-foreskin ideas, where you never learn the foreskins functions or purpose, and where you live in perfect and all encompassing ignorance about what you've lost. This is how it continues, and thus it's only over subsequent generations that it will be stopped. Every boy left intact is a potential ally waiting to mature into a man who loves and appreciates his foreskin. The more people who actually get to experience intact sexual function, the fewer who will be willing to give it up or take it away from someone else.   What do you think would be the biggest effective game-changer for the movement?   I've been thinking about this a lot recently actually. After arguing against circumcision for the better part of three years now, I've noticed a few trends in people's attitudes. At the very top of the list of commonalities amongst people who are pro-circumcision and anti-foreskin, is that deeply engrained ignorance about the foreskin. Even amongst fellow intactivists I notice a startling lack of understanding for what exactly it does; how it moves, how it feels during sex. This is to be expected though, when many intactivists are themselves circumcised. To imagine the mechanics of sex to be fundamentally different, to be drastically more rich and lush with sensation, is beyond most people because they just cannot see it. It makes no intuitive sense.   Intactivists talk far too much about the 20k nerve endings and all the specialized parts that are removed. This means absolutely nothing to a circumcised man. You're trying to explain the 3rd dimension to a 2D creature. There is nothing in their life that they would've experienced that would allow them to make a meaningful and personal connection to that information. It's just numbers and anatomical names.  What we need to be doing is educating men on how the foreskin would make their sex life better. We need to be focusing on how these parts work together to produce a more enjoyable, cohesive sexual experience. We need to be discussing the gliding mechanism in complete unabashed detail.   As someone almost 3 years into his restoration I recently (finally) had my ""eureka"" moment. I call it this because I don't know how else to describe it. This was the moment I first experienced this gliding mechanism for myself, during sex with my girlfriend. It's so incredibly difficult to describe what it's like, and yet when you experience it its like a switch is flipped in your brain. Your body suddenly remembers what it's supposed to be interpreting, what it's supposed to be feeling. In a rush of intimate and divine understanding you just get it.   ""THIS is what the foreskin is for! How could I have not seen it sooner?""  I always knew what it was, intellectually. I know all of the parts, their histological makeup and innervation. Their physiological roles and functions. It's an entirely different thing to understand it intrinsically, to understand it in your blood, and in every one of your cells. To understand it deep in your soul.  It is truly amazing, just how different it feels. The feeling of entering your partner fully sheathed, before your moist, delicately sensitive and protected glans is unveiled, emerging inside of her producing an entirely different sensation than that of your penis stimulating itself. The now supple inner mucosal layers unraveling and sliding past each other before exposing themselves and your most sensitive remaining tissue to the vaginal walls on the instroke. The remaining frenular delta interacting with the delicate tissue of your partner, triggering the most intensely sensitive part of your entire organ just enough to inch you closer to orgasm, but not push you over unexpectedly while still being rich and deep in variety of feeling. You have an incredible amount of control, as you simply feel way more. Then on the out stroke the entire thing reverses, as your glans retreats back into the skin, another change in sensation, this time a soft and sumptuous messaging of your inner surfaces against each other, from the outside. Less intense, a lovely break and change of tactile scenery (you can tell when you're in your partner, or in your own skin as they feel completely different from each other) before you pump forward and emerge once again into full blown ecstasy.   If circumcised men could feel what I feel now, they would be pissed. I don't even have all the original parts, and I can tell you I was absolutely floored by how amazing the gliding mechanism feels in action. All this and I have plenty of skin left to grow, plenty more improvement to look forward to.  This is what will change this practice, alongside targeting clinical policy at every level (not just doctors, but administrators, insurance, legislation, hospital boards / consultants, etc.). We need to properly market and develop foreskin restoration, so that more men can see for themselves what they're missing. Foreskin restoration already has all the pieces necessary to successfully proliferate into the public sphere. It works well (dramatically so), is simple in practice, and most importantly can be done effectively for little money, or no money at all. I'm in the process of developing a potential awareness program to do exactly this, bring restoration to the masses in a format that easy to digest, and attractive. What man doesn't want to say that his sex life is miles better than what it used to be, especially when he can have that for free?"
Intactivists,36sech,aPseudonymPho,2,Thu May 21 22:41:28 2015 UTC,Nice description. Put that in your marketing materials.
Intactivists,36sech,hbgbz,5,Fri May 22 00:21:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I intend to. I've been spending a lot of time thinking about what the best way is to quickly and effectively communicate the motion and roles of the foreskin during sex, so that circumcised men can understand how much the circumcision process simplifies and reduces the mechanics of intercourse. I think this is the first step in getting them to understand and perhaps consider restoration, as they have to see what they're trying to get back first."

Intactivists,36sech,hbgbz,2,Fri May 22 22:54:45 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent description of the fullness, richness, and intensity that nature has intended.  MGM takes an incredibly powerful, beautiful spiritual and emotional experience and reduces it down to a crude, base urge."
Intactivists,36sech,TorontoIntactivist,2,Sat May 23 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words.  As I said, I knew intellectually what was taken from me and have for a long time. Despite this, I'll never forget those first few seconds when I felt the gliding mechanism working. It was truly surreal. Years of technical research papers, anatomical texts, and histological studies of the intact penile anatomy, alongside countless hours spent studying, learning, and honing my knowledge coalesced in an instant, to the greatest epiphany of my life. In that moment I didn't just know what the foreskin did, I truly understood it deep within the core of my being. It really was like suddenly seeing colour for the first time. For the first time ever I wasn't just speculating on how it felt to be intact, I was brushing up against it. It was like being awoken from the matrix. I will remember, recount, and reflect upon that experience until the day I die I suspect.  I apologize for my flowery language, but words really fail to convey what it was like. I'm still (obviously) reeling and blown away by the experience, so the best I can do is flex my thesaurus to try and hobble together a rough descriptor.   MGM takes an incredibly powerful, beautiful spiritual and emotional experience and reduces it down to a crude, base urge.   I suppose that this is exactly what I'm trying to say. I'd heard accounts of men cut as adults saying they lost upwards of 70% of their feeling and sensation after the procedure, but I couldn't really understand what that meant in any kind of real, tangible way. How do you imagine 70% more sensation? I honestly don't think that I really believed it, I mean, most of my sexual sensitivity and feeling was gone? How could that be realistic or accurate when I still thoroughly enjoyed sex?   Once you've felt it though, there is no going back. Once you've experienced it, you know deep in your heart that it's true. The gliding mechanism is the centerpiece. It is the binding feature that unifies all the pieces of the penis together, and synchronizes them into a symphony of sexual pleasure. Each part (the ridged band, the frenulum, the inner mucousa) all play a vital and unique role, but it is the gliding mechanism that fits them together into an exquisitely beautiful and unique piece of music, into a cohesive piece of art.   It pains me tremendously to think about all the men who will never experience this. Who will know nothing but a small piece of this profoundly and intensely enjoyable experience. I used to be careful about overstating the damage of circumcision because I was unsure, but now I am certain. At the very least it has solidified my resolve for the future to complete my restoration 100%, and to do everything I possibly can until the day I die to end this practice forever."
Intactivists,36sech,aPseudonymPho,13,Sat May 23 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"1) Since I was 16. I was innocently on the computer one day, in a good mood but kind of bored, and out of pure innocent curiosity decided to ask myself    ""Why are some guys circumcised and other guys aren't. What's up with that?""   With in 2 or 3 hours I was horrified and all the colour had drained from my face. From that day forward I was an intactivist.   2) Realistically it will probably take a minimum of another 50 - 75 years but I sense a tipping point coming in the next 10 - 25 years.   3) The internet is a huge game changer. The medical system's push for genital mutilation thrives on censorship and propaganda. With the internet doctors are starting to lose control of the narrative. The internet allows people to compare pro and anti circumcision arguments side by side and see who is telling the truth. Many men suffer lasting psychological, physical, and sexual consequences from circumcision with many of these men limping through life never being aware of where their problems stem from or that there even was a problem in the first place; the internet awakens these men. The internet gives a voice to those who would otherwise be forced to suffer in silence. The internet gets the word out to millions of people who may have otherwise never given circumcision a second thought (like I was when I was 16). Internet slacktivism does actually work. Soundbites, memes, infographics and all manner of social media really help.   People simply have a blind faith in doctors and the public at large is simply asleep to the issue. Many good, regular people out there would question circumcision if they were given a chance to see the horrors of it."
Intactivists,36sech,TorontoIntactivist,5,Thu May 21 20:11:15 2015 UTC,I love the term slacktivism. I hadn't really seen it used before.  Thanks for sharing your story. I agree that the internet is a huge game-changer.

Intactivists,36sech,celtic_thistle,3,Sat May 23 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"I believe the Internet has done much for our cause; spreading information about genital mutilation has obviously changed many people's opinions and what they would have otherwise been ignorant of. I also believe Foregen and other initiatives to reverse circumcision through regenerative medicine will show that there are many who wish to be uncircumcised, and/or would benefit from having their penis partially reconstructed with the addition of sexual nerve endings."
Intactivists,36sech,PrimesteFericera,2,Thu May 21 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"I've kind of always been like ""wtf, why is that considered necessary?"" I'm a woman, and the only men I've been with were cut. I just thought it was unnecessary but had no idea how extensive the amputation is.  When I got pregnant in 2013, my husband and I discussed the matter and considering we're both pretty ""crunchy"" as parents (breastfeeding, I tried for a natural birth, etc) we knew we didn't want to circ if it was a boy. We did more research to show any family members who asked us why we were making the choice, and I was appalled to see how the mutilation is actually done.   We have a perfect little boy; he is almost 1 and I am extremely proud to say he is intact. My husband was particularly vehement about not circumcising. He himself was cut and wishes it had been left up to him.  I've really become a full-blown intactivist with the Chase case, honestly. It's driving me insane to see men defending their own mutilation, and people lazily going along with it ""just because."" WHY?! My husband is an intactivist too and has expressed interest in foreskin restoration for himself.  We live in CO, and the western US has the lowest rates of infant cutting in the country, but it's still too damn high. I think as cases like Chase and Heather's become more publicized, people on the fence or who have never thought about it will see that it is so unnecessary and cruel. Plus, I know in CO, Medicaid won't cover the procedure. So maybe that'll help dissuade some people too."
Intactivists,36sech,Psychobird7,3,Sat May 23 23:00:02 2015 UTC,Love it! I have an intact baby boy myself. Funny how that will make you and intactivist pretty quickly! The Chase case is just killing me!
Intactivists,36sech,Psychobird7,2,Sat May 23 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"How long have you been at this? Since I was pregnant with my first son. I started doing research on it and was appalled. I wouldn't say I'm the most vocal or public activist, but I try to be a gentle voice of reason in any debates I see online. It might not be earth shatteringly effective, but I hope I've changed a mind or two over the years.  How long do you realistically think it will be till we see the end of genital cutting in the US?  It's impossible to estimate a specific year, but I don't think any laws will be passed until the majority of the population is uncircumcised. According to statistics we're getting there, but it may be forty more years until today's babies are in positions to change things. Luckily the tide is turning on it's own, so I'm confident that the practice will peter out eventually. Perhaps it will even go extinct without laws. Wouldn't that be great! Once the locker room and ""look like dad"" arguments aren't relevant I think a lot less people will do the procedure.  What do you think would be the biggest effective game-changer for the movement? I don't think there's one single thing that could change people's minds. I think more celebrities talking about it, and stronger statements from medical organizations would be most effective. People love to copy celebrities, and if they realize the medical benefits are slim to nil, they'll be less likely to do it.   Also we have to think of the parents who circumcised their first son because they though that was just ""what was done"" and are worried about not having ""matching"" sons. This is a common concern, and judging from what I've seen on mommy forums it can go two ways. 1. They choose to leave their second son intact. 2. They guiltily circ their second son, and later become rabidly defensive of the practice. We have to remember to not be overbearing and cause guilt."

How long do you realistically think it will be till we see the end of genital cutting in the US on Earth?          FTFY. Most countries in the middle East do this too, Jews do it, Muslims do it... none of them have more rights to do it than anyone in the US or anywhere else in the universe.       What do you think would be the biggest effective game-changer for the movement?         Probably Foregen's first big success stories, formerly circumcised men telling everyone how much better it feels? Would prob be all over the news. In the immediate future, I think Chase's case (/Hironimus) could have a large impact; letters are being sent to urologists all over the US... and if none of them accepts to perform the surgery (unlikely, but a man can dream ;_;)... I mean it could, right? <<"
Intactivists,36sech,aPseudonymPho,2,Fri May 22 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wonder if many people who are new to this, like us, are most vocal and then enthusiasm wanes as life etc. happens.   Most countries in the middle East do this too, Jews do it, Muslims do it   While I agree that it is just as bad in these places for religious reasons, it is not a problem that I feel I can speak to much. I think that fixing the problem in the US will take one set of solutions, and is actually relatively easier. I think it will take much more work and much more time to tackle the issue overseas.   Probably Foregen's first big success stories   I'm not that optimistic about this happening soon. It's not because I'm a pessimist. I think regrowing the tissue and even connecting it may not be so hard. It's getting an older brain to process the information correctly that I guess would be the hardest part.

Yes it will be hard enough to end it in the US alone, but intact planet would be the next step. Finland completely outlawed it afaik, and Germany is starting to heavily question religious cutting, which is... good.       It's bound to have ""some"" success to be honest, but yeah it might take some time. But it'll happen, eventually. (I hope)       One day it won't be a dream anymore."

Just know that the more you try to work through and confront all the emotions you have instead of repressing and denying what you feel, the more you will empower yourself.

CI-0 is a very tight cut though, so it's not unlikely that you've lost a lot of tissue.   The biggest improvement from restoration comes from regaining the gliding mechanic, especially during penetrative intercourse. That doesn't come until later though unfortunately.

The shame in ordering a stupid foreskin stretcher that I shouldn't have to hide nor pay for to have just an idea of what a normal unaltered dick is like kills me everyday and haunts me every night. The fact that it's legal makes people think it's nothing to be unhappy about and that makes the pain as bad as it gets.  Know that we need you, I need you.

Still, it has a lot of good information and commentary, particularly the quotes from FGM victims Soraya Mire and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, as well as from feminists like Gloria Steinem and Alice Walker.  It's nice to have a reputable source to cite countering the idea that anyone who compares male and female genital cutting must be either ignorant of FGM or a misogynist.

Intactivists,35nnyf,JohnKimble111,11,Tue May 12 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"This guy has really got it right here, it absolutely is a dirty secret and that is one of the biggest vehicles that keeps the practice going; the secrecy. If you talk about circumcision, then you naturally are led to talk about the intact penis, and this raises questions. The answers to these questions are damning for circumcision, and thus the entire thing is stifled and thrown under the rug. This is hallmark to many traditions that are passed to our children, in that we set up a social narrative where this topic is simply not to be discussed. After enough time most people not longer question it. They're no longer curious.   It really sucks to be one of those boys, who grew up never losing that curiosity. To be the one with the confused look on his face, while your friend has to be the one to tell you that you're missing a part of your body because someone cut it off for no reason. It truly feels awful to discover and unravel piece by piece, the sheer depth and breadth of destruction wrought against the most intimate part of oneself, with willful intent, and gold leafed, financed ignorance.  The reactions of people absolutely tell it all, and after a solid 3 years of debating and sharpening my rhetoric on this topic, I've come to see the same patterns he has. Some people see how this topic is pushed into the dark, and their curiosity is ignited again. Some already know, and are supportive or quick to understand. Most people, are angry. They're defensive. They're offended that you would even think to question their reality, and the validity of the tradition that forced them into said reality. Like an animal trapped and wounded in a corner, they will fight tooth and nail, life and limb to escape the questions and possibilities that you're awakening in them, that they are being shown and made aware of.  They cannot shield their eyes and ears forever, nor can they indoctrinate their children indefinitely. Eventually the truth will be heard in full, and then I (we all) can finally rest easy."

It absolutely is, and the dogmatic pandering to ""personal choice"" is what keeps it like this. Circumcision has the same protections and amnesty from responsibility that religion does; accept others religions or be accused of being a bigot. Except here we're accused of being... penis obsessed?  Getting this conversation into the public sphere is a major hurdle that needs to be overcome."
Intactivists,35nnyf,aPseudonymPho,1 point,Wed May 13 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"I think that the religious link is what keeps miring down the intactivist movement, but it doesn't have to be this way. It is all to easy to call us antisemitic, or say that we are trying to stifle religious freedom, but wouldn't it be a stronger ""covenant with god"" if a man of the Jewish faith made the informed choice to be circumcised at the age of consent? I believe it is called a Brit Shalom, where the baby is given a name and accepted into Judaism without any bodily modification. I don't know, but I think this could help to decouple the genital autonomy issue from the religious freedom issue.  P.s. Sorry for shitting up your thread last night with my rage. I have been coming to this sub as a form of therapy to deal with emotional issues regarding my own circumcision, and I sometimes have difficulty keeping it civil. I very much appreciate your well thought out posts, keep doing what you're doing."
Intactivists,35nnyf,overtorqued_nut,1 point,Wed May 20 08:07:53 2015 UTC,"You're right in that Judaism doesn't absolutely mandate circumcision. Iirc, officially a Jew is anyone who was born of a Jewish family and recognizes the faith, not necessarily one whom is circumcised. However the fact remains that people who use religion as their justification, often aren't driven by attention to detail of history; they simply want to get their way and ""have a Jewish child"". It doesn't matter if the child will grow up to reject the faith, because this circumcision will mark him forever and show undoubtedly that he was for a time, Jewish.   I've also heard a lot that Judaism revolves around community, and thus if your religious community considers you to be Jewish, then you basically are (even if you don't self identify that way). Your parents knowing that they circumcised you is another good way for them to reaffirm your being Jewish even further, especially if you grow to reject the religion. It's really quite a lot of self-serving mental gymnastics to be frank.   It absolutely would be a more meaningful covenant for you to sacrifice your own flesh to God; but that isn't what it's about. Again it's about ensuring as much as possible that your faith is passed on to your children. It's as selfish as it could be, while being wrapped in a guise of prudent child rearing. That is why arguments appealing to the meaning of the covenant fall flat; it is the parents covenant with God, to sacrifice the flesh of their child as was once sacrificed of them, and NOT the covenant of the child. Children cannot agree to a covenant, it's a contract effectively. How can someone agree to a contract they literally have no concept or knowledge of? This is why Jews get so up in arms about their rights, because it really has nothing to do with the child; it has to do with them. Their religion dictates that the contact be signed in the flesh and blood of their sons, and their sons contracts signed in kind the following generation. This is also where you see parallels in other genital cutting cultures; it's always targeting children under the rights of the parents so that the cycle can be most likely to successfully continue.    P.s. Sorry for shitting up your thread last night with my rage. I have been coming to this sub as a form of therapy to deal with emotional issues regarding my own circumcision, and I sometimes have difficulty keeping it civil. I very much appreciate your well thought out posts, keep doing what you're doing.   No need to apologize again, you already did once. Look, we've all been (or are) where you are right now. It's a really shitty thing that was done to us, for really shitty reasons and there's no getting around it. Things only get worse because everything thinks you're an idiot or crazy for not being in love with having a part of your dick cut off and stolen from you (fuck me right?). I understand what you're struggling with 100%, because I've struggled with it, and often still do. It really hurts to know that your body was damaged in this way, and hurts even more to know how little people care or what they think about it overall.   However, there is a lot more to life than your circumcision and penis. If you find yourself unable to control your emotions, take a break. Spend more time with your friends, or family, enjoying your hobbies and whatnot. Life is not uniform, there are plenty of reasons to be happy, and plenty to be upset. Being circumcised is one reason to be upset, but don't forget to also explore the reasons to be happy. You'll feel a lot better for it in the end (if you can work to accepting the things we cannot change), and you'll also be a more effective intactivist. You cannot win arguments with emotion, you with arguments with information, even, fair, and reasoned dialog. You win by making people think, not by making them defensive. You also have to remember that for every one person engaging you, 10+ are watching / reading. Their opinion matters too, and you have even less of a chance to sway their vote since they're watching from afar.   As a final point, I'd strongly recommend looking into restoration. It's awesome."

Yes these so-called feminists may care about gender equality and things of that nature, but if they don't study and/or understand the culture and dynamics of oppression and intersectionality they aren't feminists. Circumcision is rooted in the same shameful traditions of coercion, control, forced conformity, and subjugation that have kept women down for thousands of years.

Similar to parents who consider themselves ""crunchy"" and natural but subject their sons to genital cutting. Those people aren't crunchy and natural. They are natural in name only.

They condemn the people who do it to their wives or refuse to marry an intact woman in, say, Africa; and yet cutting a baby boy ""should be the parents' choice"" or some other bullshit. Sure, FGC could have tons of potential health benefits.

Studies that appear to support routine circumcision are all deeply flawed. They are usually reported uncritically by a U.S.-dominated media.

NSFW    The callousing is directly related to a loss of sensitivity.  One of the biggest drawbacks is the loss of the gliding action, over 1/3 to 1/2 of all penis skin(NSFW) is cut of during circumcision.  Without that gliding action it can be harder to enter a woman if she is not fully aroused, it also causes a lot of cut guys to masturbate with lubricant or skin lotion because they can't take the friction of normal masturbation.  Also, without the foreskin the head acts like a plunger and scrapes female natural vaginal lubricant out and away from the vagina during sex potentially causing more friction etc.    There are a lot of downsides to being cut that people aren't aware of but very little research will lead them too.  That's good that you wouldn't judge a guy for being cut, as against it as I am they can't help it and I'm glad you recognize that.  Having been endlessly teased about being intact growing up and having a couple girls tell me no after taking it out I wouldn't want an intact guy to go through with that either for something their parents did to them."

And it's one that can be changed, at least in the United States, simply by informing the general American public 1) that the vast majority of men in the developed world have their foreskins and aren't any worse for it and 2) these men are actually better for it because the foreskin is sexually sensitive, erogenous, pleasurable, protective (of the glans) tissue.

Intactivists,34v09q,Psychobird7,10,Mon May 4 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"You could devise health benefits from cutting off pretty much ANY tissue from infants.  Cut off breast buds at birth and reduce the risk of breast cancer!  Cut off earlobes at birth and reduce the risk of skin cancer there!  Cut off little girls' labia at birth and reduce the risk of labial adhesions and the attendant UTIs!  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/labial_adhesions  But we don't.  Why?  Because it's UNETHICAL to remove normal, healthy tissue--especially EROGENOUS tissue from the most sensitive, most personal, most private parts of one's body--from an infant's body because it MIGHT get infected/diseased someday.  The one bizarre exception we make to this general ethical standard is circumcision, and only MALE circumcision.  However, we have (thankfully) banned FEMALE circumcision (in ALL forms, not just the ones that remove the clitoris).  And put simply, the U.S. FGM law is based on the assumption that ALL baby girl genital cutting is wrong on its face, regardless of any potential health benefits (which have never been researched in sterile, anesthetized Western conditions–the conditions in which we examine male circumcision).  If this is the reasoning for protecting baby girls’ genitals, how is it not sexism under the law to not apply the same reasoning to baby boys’ genitals?  http://notyourstocut.com/2015/01/28/equal-protection/"

I take issue with your use of the word ""anesthetized"".   Please watch the start of this video (just watch until the baby sounds like he's choking on his own tongue, it isn't necessary to watch the whole thing) to convince yourself that we don't actually DO anesthesia for this. Even when the doctor says that's what happening and does the injections, it isn't anesthesia. Having the slightest awareness of what is happening will keep you from ever using the word ""anesthetized"" in conjunction with neonatal circumcision.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXVFFI76ff0  I hope watching the beginning of this ""anesthetized"" neonatal circumcision doesn't make you puke or want to commit homicide or otherwise ruin your afternoon.

We are adaptive creatures by nature, just as life of every variety is, and it is by leveraging this adaptability that this insane practice continues at all (or any inhumane practice for that matter).  As I mentioned I was really blown away by how quickly my friend came to the same conclusions we all have here.

Intactivists,34mr8v,Psychobird7,2,Sun May 3 03:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know how you can be blind enough to accept this going on.      Good to know I'm not (completely) nuts. On one hand is makes me sad for these people (and their kids) but on the other hand it's like... why do I bother if they're gonna respond with the likes of ""Shit dude, just checked your post history and I take back what I said about guys not having psychological issues. You have a weird-ass obsession with your dick, and clearly have some sort of foreskin superiority complex."" This is utter bs."
Intactivists,34mr8v,Psychobird7,3,Sun May 3 04:20:39 2015 UTC,"All you can do is power forward, and fight for what you believe. People will call us names, associate us with everything from pedophiles to people suffering severe psychological disorders (which isn't uncommon for people whom are maimed I would guess), and fight tooth and nail for the reality they believe in. Just look at slavery, do you think the caucasian majority simply rolled over and said, ""you're right, we shouldn't be doing this""?  This is no different. It just takes a different form, and has different consequences for the people it impacts. It can be hard to see at times, but we are slowly yet surely winning this fight. Several of my friends and family members never gave circumcision a second thought, and after seeing how I've experienced my own circumcision and hearing what I have to say, have adamantly rejected the practice. They vow to never inflict this upon any of their future children, and to speak up against it whenever they can.  This is how change is effected, through many small efforts over time, from many people working together."
Intactivists,34mr8v,Psychobird7,2,Sun May 3 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah we are. There's a reason why cutting rates are going down so much... I think Foregen will do a lot of good too, because it'll allow cut men to tell the difference."
Intactivists,34mr8v,throwaway136529,2,Sun May 3 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of cut men are really hoping and praying for foregen to come through. I'm certainly one of them. I mean, who that truly understands what is lost in a circumcision doesn't wish to be intact? Doesn't wish to be whole again?  The unfortunate reality however, is that I do not believe foregen will succeed anytime soon. I dont say this to disparage, or discourage. Only to give a realistic perspective on the science and politics involved. I've studied and worked in the biochemical / biomedical field my entire life. I plan to continue to do so until I die, as biochemistry is a passion of mine. The fact of the matter is that the technology is just not there. The science is just not there. The understanding of the underlying life processes is just not there.  People (the layman) really do not understand how complex the cell is. We understand a tiny, tiny fraction of the cell signalling processes that occur at every timescale for example (nanosecond protein folding interactions all the way up to multi-second assembly interactions and beyond), and even less of the mechanisms by which these pathways are regulated, controlled and modulated. To succeed in regenerative medicine is to succeed in effectively reprograming our cells at every level of their existence, to follow the biophysical-chemical pathway we predetermine, to arrive at our desired result.  I just don't see it happening in the next decade, and probably not in the next two or maybe even three. This is before we even begin to touch the politics, regulations, and federal involvement that will certainly be present. Who get's priority for regenerative tissue breakthroughs such that they pass government approval and hit the market? Circumcision victims, or burn victims? What about victims of severe congenital tissue defects? It's a sad state of affairs, but I am truly hopeful for the best. I'm certainly not a PhD, so this is just my own personal opinions on what I've learned and seen in the field thusfar (in my limited experience).  To cut my tangent off here, I do agree that foregen would massively speed up this struggle. It would likely cause this practice to be abolished nearly overnight, presuming it was affordable, safe, and effective in its regenerative abilities."
Intactivists,34mr8v,k_kat,2,Sun May 3 04:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, sadly enough I doubt Foregen will succeed as quickly as they said they would.

They are so blithe and casual about having it done to their sons. Because the practice is so normal and legitimized through the medical industry it's hard for them to see that it's a problem. I don't think it's difficult for an informed person to reach an individual mother but I think right now that information is not getting in front of the right people.
Intactivists,34mr8v,overtorqued_nut,2,Sun May 3 12:18:30 2015 UTC,"A big part of the reason people are unaware is because, since people get personally upset by the topic, moderators tend to shut down discussion about it in all different forums and businesses won't publish information on it. I understand that /r/sex shuts down circumcision discussions; my active local mothers group on Facebook recently shut down a post; La Leche League, the largest supporter of breastfeeding, won't take a stance on circumcision and won't publish anything about it. The result is that despite the fact that the information is readily availabile on the internet that circumcision is quackery, nobody can share the news!

Intactivists,33blf4,dalkon,8,Tue Apr 21 04:45:18 2015 UTC,I'm glad there are more studies like this being released. It's a sign of progress.
Intactivists,33blf4,K5WCAXmGVn,7,Tue Apr 21 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"Reviews like this both advance intactivism and are a sign of its progress, I agree, but just to be clear about terms, this is secondary research or a review of studies. Study as you used the term tends to imply primary research (experiments, trials, tests or surveys). Sorry if this focus on nomenclature seems pedantic. I make it because this is actually an important point for intactivists to understand about the history of foreskin excision research. There is less primary research about the foreskin than there should be especially given the popularity of destroying it in circumcising cultures. Especially notably, there is much less foreskin research than research designed to promote foreskin excision. That is because circumcision activists have dominated both the literature on foreskin excision and positions of influence in the medical community since the early 20th century. Research into the functions of the foreskin (which shows its potential value to the individual) has only existed since the 1990s and remained scarce until after 2000. Research demonstrating the function of the foreskin shows that foreskin excision entails a loss of function, which has made intactivism much more persuasive than it was when intactivist arguments were limited to risk, pain and mere lack of necessity as they were in the past. * clarity"
Intactivists,33blf4,k_kat,8,Wed Apr 22 01:04:18 2015 UTC,The AAP or CDC guidelines are the kingpin. Once that falls the circumcisers will have nothing left to fall back on. Criticism like this is great.
Intactivists,33blf4,k_kat,7,Tue Apr 21 12:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think doctors' ignorance about the sexual functions of the foreskin are the lynchpin error supporting our cultural tradition of medicalized foreskin excision. The AAP and CDC's recent opinions reflect and reinforce that ignorance, but the history of this ignorance is much older than the AAP's 2012 vague surgery promotion and the CDC's more recent surgery promotion."
Intactivists,33blf4,aPseudonymPho,6,Wed Apr 22 00:47:08 2015 UTC,"The AAP and CDC's statement did come about for the reasons you suggest but they hold even greater value now. Without the AAP and CDC's statement I think the doctors are open to lawsuits. Once that recommendation falls, the doctors have no official medical stance to fall back on. The words are very carefully crafted in order to support the doctors. Once those official statements change this whole circumcision thing crumbles. That's why it's essential for the doctors to keep it as it is and there's no way they can afford to change it now. I think the AAP statement will be one of the last things to go, not the first, sort of like taking the castle's flag towards the end of an attack."
Intactivists,32n1c6,dalkon,11,Wed Apr 15 02:28:09 2015 UTC,That would require research so no.
Intactivists,32n1c6,Irrel_M,4,Wed Apr 15 09:40:00 2015 UTC,"There should be more research about the foreskin than about destroying it, but circumcision activists have dominated the literature since the early 20th century. Still, beginning in the 1990s a lot of research has shown that the foreskin is an important sensory structure of the penis: Sorrells, 2007; Taylor, 1996; Meislahn & Taylor, 2004; Podnar, 2012; Bensley & Boyle, 2001; Bronselaer, 2013; Cold & McGrath, 1999; Crosby & Charnigo, 2013. Quoting Van Howe (2013):   Anatomically, the foreskin is highly erogenous, pentalaminar, specialized, junctional (transitional) tissue. Other transitional tissues in the body include the lips and eyelids. These transitional tissues all have a high concentration of fine-touch neuroreceptors at the junction of internal (mucosal) surfaces with external (epidermal) surfaces. [The junction area feels like the primary focal point of the penis. The junction area after the surgery is the surgical scar instead of the foreskin.] In the 19th century, physicians, recognizing that the foreskin was the most sensitive portion of the penis, recommended its removal as a ""cure"" for masturbation. Only recently was the ridged band of the prepuce, which is completely removed by circumcision, identified as containing nearly all of the penis's fine-touch neuroreceptors.   Numerous medical organizations have noted that the foreskin is a valuable sensory structure of the penis. In 2009 the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia wrote that the foreskin ""is rich in specialized sensory nerve endings and erogenous tissue. Circumcision is painful, and puts the patient at risk for complications ranging from minor, as in mild local infections, to more serious such as injury to the penis, meatal stenosis, urinary retention, urinary tract infection and, rarely, even hemorrhage leading to death."" In 2010, the Royal Dutch Medical Association stated that the foreskin is ""a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation"". The Royal Australasian College of Physicians wrote, ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" The Danish Medical Association (Lægeforeningen) and Danish Society of Family Physicians (Dansk Selskab for Almen Medicin) have recommended non-therapeutic male circumcision should wait until the boy or young man is old enough to provide informed consent. Circumcision which is not medically indicated is a mutilation and a violation and should be restricted to being performed with consent. The British Medical Association informational literature states: ""It is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. … Very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. … Parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child."" Representing Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish clinical sexologists, in 2013 the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology stated:   The penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia. The foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions. It protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity. Ancient historic accounts and recent scientific evidence leave little doubt that during sexual activity the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive, erogenous structure, capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners.  As clinical sexologists, we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys. To cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal, healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision. Unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent, the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity."

Intactivists,32n1c6,aPseudonymPho,4,Wed Apr 15 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"It is by and large, Americans. I would say 70-80% of people supporting pro circumcision stances are American. The other small portion would mostly be Jewish with smatterings in other culture groups here and there.   Just like with female genital cutting procedures in America, outside the U.S. (North America really) there is little to no cultural impetus and thus people see the procedure for exactly what it is; a destruction of healthy tissue for marginal and entirely inconsequential health benefits. That is not nearly as 'rose coloured' as a paradigm, compared to, 'making sure my child fits in and is a true member of our culture / society'. When you look at the language of circumcision you can really see that it is very much a procedure of personal identity for both the parents, as well as the child. The medical benefits just bolster this stance and further justify it in their minds."
Intactivists,32n1c6,Psychobird7,3,Wed Apr 15 20:09:56 2015 UTC,"The other small portion would mostly be Jewish       They do advocate circumcision but they don't give a damn about potential benefits afaik, they only want it to bring them closer to god or something.

Wives must realize that their sex lives have been forever changed.   There simply is no way out of this cutting culture except right through the grief. Everyone has been harmed by this procedure. In many ways we are all victims here. We have to give ourselves room to be kind and to heal. The people to blame are long dead.    Shaming circumcised men or rubbing salt in the wound by saying and intact man is ""better"" than them is wrong too. After all, the circumcised man is the biggest victim here.

When mothers realize their son may loose something of value to them it completely changes their thinking."
Intactivists,329ixq,k_kat,5,Tue Apr 14 12:30:16 2015 UTC,The issue with foreskin pride is that it in effect excludes all those that are circumcised. As a grown man that was circed as a baby I have no reference to have pride in foreskin but I do have reference to knowing that a part of me was removed without my permission and thus I work to stop practice.
Intactivists,329ixq,ZiggyZoomber,4,Sun Apr 12 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with this strategy is that it can be interpreted as sexual, and there's an increasing amount of opposition in society to heterosexual men being open about sexual matters and a general tendency to demonise men and sex.  There is already a fairly strong pro foreskin movement within the gay community and that seems to work ok, and it would also work for women to express their desire and attraction for men with a natural penis. However, different rules apply to most men it can be slightly risky to celebrate the foreskin too much. Obviously it's nothing like the same as circumfetishists who gets their kicks out of mutilating kids, but clearly the best strategy is to attack such child abusers.  To be honest there's nothing to celebrate about having a foreksin becasue that's just normal isn't it and how things are meant to be? We don't celebrate having legs or arms do we?"
Intactivists,329ixq,JohnKimble111,3,Sun Apr 12 17:01:43 2015 UTC,My immediate reaction is no.
Intactivists,329ixq,anticapitalist,3,Sun Apr 12 06:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I wouldn't use the word ""pride"" for all its current connotations.  Also, the idea of men being ""proud"" of their penis just doesn't resonate.  I would try instead to ride the positive sense of the word ""natural"" that's out there now. Not sure how to do that specifically."
Intactivists,329ixq,wufoo2,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:27:04 2015 UTC,"I guess a much better thing to say is that the movement could be focused on being PRO FORESKIN not ""Foreskin Pride"". We have to get the word out there that the foreskin itself is functional, important and valued."
Intactivists,329ixq,k_kat,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:21:53 2015 UTC,"Pride isn't the right word, I don't think. I would call it appreciation, and I think it should be a worthwhile tactic.   Promoting foreskin appreciation is a part of intactivism for males in the same way that promoting vulva appreciation has been a part of intactivism for females. In both cases, the problem is mainly rooted in ignorance. While most women are happy enough with their intact genitalia that they understand why to oppose female genital cutting, men in male circumcising cultures are in the same boat as women in that subset of male circumcising cultures that also practice female circumcision, they don't want to believe the foreskin is normally functional and valuable. In both cases, people respond better to research challenging their cultural belief in the validity of non-therapeutic/cultural genital tissue excision (and the invalidity of the culturally maligned excised parts). This is why research demonstrating the functional nature of the foreskin has been so useful and important for intactivism. It is also helpful to recognize how new this research is especially compared to research produced by circumcision activists. Research about the foreskin only really started being performed in the 1990s, and there was still very little until after 2000. Circumcision activists, on the other hand, have been very actively producing research to promote non-therapeutic foreskin excision for more than a century. They have produced an enormous volume of research. This cultural bias in the medical literature is worth explaining because it also explains how so many doctors in the US remain uninformed about the functional nature and value of the foreskin."
Intactivists,329ixq,dalkon,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"No. If you're going to apply a non-""anti"" label, then ""Pro-Foreskin"" is a far, far better thing to say.

Knowledge is power. If you find an organization you trust consider donating. Pace yourself as it can be emotionally draining.   (These links are by no means an exhaustive list)   www.nocirc.org/‎ www.arclaw.org/‎ www.drmomma.org www.noharmm.org/‎ www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org www.bloodstainedmen.com/‎ Penn & Teller: Bullshit! Circumcision (NSFW) www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyxgdfWHJQ (A man at a festival explains the psychology behind circumcision denial.)    Develop resilience, wisdom, and conviction. You will be attacked, A LOT. In person be measured with whom you talk to and how.  Understand the forces that put it in play and keep it going: Introduction of trauma, denial of sexual pleasure, religious/cultural branding.   I believe it's ultimately an attempt at power and control over the individual.   They dress it up as medicine or spirituality (implying that the body or soul is naturally dirty), but I don't buy it.    Religious versions are often celebrations with many witnesses. (Bonding through shared trauma) In ancient Egypt circumcision was used to mark slaves. It sends a powerful psychological message to the individual that he is property. (If you don't even have ownership over the most private part of yourself, what do you truly have ownership of?)  The trauma of circumcision I believe causes lasting psychological harm, and there is a growing body of scientific evidence that this is the case. ""Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger."" If that were true soldiers would come back from war 10 feet tall. Instead they are often hollow, shattered men.  Loss of full sexual response. Dull the sensory input and you blunt the emotional response. A very simply example of this is music. Listen to your favourite songs on bad speakers/headphones then on good. With the volume turned down low and volume up high. Did it feel the same?  An extreme example of this is the Taliban, who fearfully ban anything (including kite flying), that might broaden a person's mental, emotional, or sensory horizons.     Psychosexual trauma: Many men simply cannot or will not face what has happened to them and many mothers simply will not accept the idea they did anything bad to their children. The internet is great because it allows you to express views that in person could get you beat-up or shunned. Many men can become incredibly agitated at the mere suggestion that something bad may have happened. (If they truly thought nothing bad had happened they will be cheerful and more than willing to debate the issue. That has rarely been the case.)   Doctors:    Profit. In the United States alone circumcision is a billion dollar industry.   Deaths they would rather keep swept under the rug; men with botched circumcisions they would rather stay silent, isolated, and ashamed. At this point they are so ego-invested and in so deep criminally many figure the only thing to do is keep digging.    Another thing I did was debate this a lot on the internet, especially places like 4chan.  ""What are you doing debating randoms on the gutter of the internet?""  Simple: Figuring out the defense mechanisms and how best to respond to them. An anonymous, anything goes place like that is the perfect place to experiment.  Many of these answers can come off as sarcastic, caustic, provocative, condescending, etc. It seems online when it comes to this issue many people refuse to listen unless you wield facts and logic like a club. How to deal with people face to face is another story.   Some common examples:  ""My penis works fine; I can still orgasm""   And the colourblind can still see. Circumcised men are up to 4.5 times more likely to suffer from ED. Testosterone can make up for a lack of sensory input, but wait until you are 40+. Female victims of FGM have said similar things.    ""Babies don't feel pain and it's a very quick simple procedure""   This one would be laughable if it wasn't so sick. At any rate it's easily debunked. (See if they can sit through a video of one without vomiting, panicking, or passing out.)    ""He won't remember it""   The absence of conscious memory does not mean the brain was not rewired. The baby's nervous system is like a sponge for sensory and emotional input. So is it ok to daterape someone if they won't remember it?   ""It's part of our culture/religion""   So is female circumcision in some regions of the world.   ""It's a simple flap of skin""   No it isn't. It's a complex array of densely-innervated structures. (see HuFo and other sources) So are your earlobes. Should we cut those off?   ""Female circumcision is much worse""   You are still admitting that it is bad. Losing a hand may be worse than losing a couple of fingers. At any rate this isn't true, it trivializes male suffering and loss, and ignores the fact that there are different forms of FGM.    ""So he will look like his father""   And if the father was missing a leg would you want that too?   ""It looks nicer""    You care so much about the aesthetics of your son's penis? Creepy... (Ask if they have ever seen a botched circumcision.)   ""His future wives/girlfriends will thank me""   Again, creepy. You care more about the future sexual fulfillment of women you have never met than that of your own progeny?   ""No woman will want him""   Would you want a woman that shallow in the first place? This is why the internet is so great as it allows anyone to have a voice. Look around online and you will find countless anecdotes from uncircumcised Canadian and American men that refute this claim.    ""It prevents HIV""   Not an ethical justification. Debunked.    ""It's cleaner/prevents STDs""    Statistics from non-circumcising countries debunk this. Again, not an ethical justification. To say nothing of all the infections caused by circumcision.   ""Boys don't know how to keep clean""   Misandric. It implies that while girls know how to keep themselves clean, boys are too stupid/uncivilized to figure this out.  An open wound in a diaper full of urine and feces is not my idea of hygiene.    ""I'm glad/grateful this was done""   Stockholm syndrome. The fox with no tail. Many women who were victims of FGM say the same thing. Do we take their word at face-value?   ""You Intactivists are crazy and obsessed with penises""   Pretty twisted logic considering it's the pro-circumcision camp that can't keep their hands off people's genitals.  We believe in bodily integrity for all children male, female, or intersex.    Understand that many people in the general public aren't even sure what a circumcision is, let alone how violent it is. Public awareness has not reached critical mass yet and until it does it will be a hard struggle up the hill."

Intactivists,31dqtw,dalkon,8,Sat Apr 4 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"This was a popular story in /r/worldnews yesterday. Here are the comments I wrote on that post.  It would be difficult if not impossible to sue the JHU faculty who were responsible who are now dead like John Charles Cutler, Joseph E. Moore, professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and was director of the Venereal Disease Division; Dr. Harry Eagle, a commissioned officer and employee of the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the government’s USPHS Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, which was located at Johns Hopkins in what was then the School of Hygiene and Public Health; Dr. Lowell Reed, who at the time was a Johns Hopkins professor and statistician and also served as dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health and later as president of the University; and Dr. Thomas B. Turner, who at the time was a professor in the School of Medicine and later became dean of the School of Medicine. The Commission’s report also identified Dr. Reed and Dr. Kenneth Maxcy, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, as members of the government’s National Advisory Health Council, which recommended funding for the proposal to the U.S. surgeon general. The report listed Dr. Lewis Weed, who earlier served as dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, as holding government positions on the National Research Council and on the Committee on Medical Research.  Here's JHU's response to the report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues from which this lawsuit stems, ""Ethically Impossible: STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948"".    [In response to someone mentioning the similarity to the Tuskegee experiments:] That is similarly unconscionable research. Ideas from the Tuskegee experiments are even more related than one might guess. Dr. Joseph E. Moore of Johns Hopkins University, who played a role in this Guatemalan study (as Chairman of the National Research Council subcommittee on Venereal Disease) also authored research repeating misinformation gleaned from the Tuskegee experiments stating that “Syphilis in the negro is in many respects a different disease from syphilis in whites.”  Probably no one would like to admit it, but these unethical studies are actually quite similar to the biased research Johns Hopkins researchers performed in Africa to promote male circumcision as if it were a ""vaccine"", an idea that has been found to promote the spread of HIV as a number of recent reports have found:   July 2012: Zimbabwe: Circumcised men not spared from HIV infection Oct. 2012: Malawi: Men more likely to practice unsafe sex after circumcision Sept. 2013: Botswana: Botswana HIV infection among circumcised men rises [archive] Sept. 2013: Kenya: Big Blow as circumcision of Luo Men fails to reduce HIV/AIDS infections in Nyanza Oct. 2013: Israel: New cases of HIV in Israel hit record high in 2012 Nov. 2013: Zimbabwe: Circumcised men indulge in risky sexual behaviour Sept. 2014: Uganda: Circumcision Promoting Risky Behaviour [archive]   And these are hardly the only unbelievably unethical studies Johns Hopkins researchers are responsible for.   Johns Hopkins researchers conducted further racist research on blacks when they conducted their lead paint study in Baltimore. Using poor black children as guinea pigs, they exposed them to “dangerous lead hazards” during a 1990’s housing study.   The US Department of Health and Human Services halted all federally funded medical research at Johns Hopkins involving human subjects after a similar investigation into a Hopkins asthma study that resulted in the death of a healthy volunteer.   http://intaction.org/circumcision-a-dangerous-mistake-for-hiv-prevention/"

Congratulations. Personally I feel like you should be glad you didn't lose much feeling rather than trying to sue anyone, though I recognize that how you feel is your prerogative. Regardless of the minimal consequences, as a child, you should not have been coerced into a non-therapeutic body modification.  Generally speaking, your parents didn't even need your consent. You are not a girl, so until you turned 18, your genitals were theirs to modify however they wanted. Most people would agree that doesn't seem ethical, but the law remains essentially undefined about it.  It would help intactivism for you to challenge your coerced consent, even though you don't have a particularly good case from an intactivist perspective. Most men who were modified without their consent lost more than you did, and unlike them, you actually did consent.  For real legal advice, as the other user already suggested, talk to Attorneys for the Rights of the Child and/or local lawyers.  Whether you have a case or not, you do seem to have a somewhat good story about your parents pressuring you to modify your penis to suit peer pressure. In the US, we generally don't like the parents in stories like these. Parents are usually expected to discourage their children from succumbing to peer pressure not enforcing (or reinforcing) it themselves."

However, I suspect you would have difficulty winning because you said ""OK"" to your parents and because you didn't express your opposition to the medical practitioners, which would give them more leeway to accept your parents' consent on your behalf.  In other countries, you might have been able to get the consent invalidated on the grounds that your parents lacked the authority to consent in the absence of a medically-valid reason, but the US generally defers excessively to the idea of parental rights.

Circumcising culture makes people extremely defensive. That's the biggest reason intactivism is challenging. If people were willing to look at the facts without bias, convincing people would be simple. The foreskin is a functional and rewarding-feeling part of the penis. That should be enough to make people see that destroying it without consent or therapeutic need is unethical. It's unfortunate that so many US doctors are so defensively anti-foreskin/pro-nontherapeutic infant genital surgery. If not for the wanton personal defensiveness of so many doctors, intactivism would already have succeeded decades ago.   It takes courage to stand against social convention even when it's as obviously ignorant as circumcising culture.

In fact, I think a lot of the reason I feel so hopping mad and worked up about this right now is because I realize just how close I was to allowing this barbarism to happen to my own son! You're absolutely right: it shouldn't be any kind of accomplishment to not cut healthy parts of your own kid off. However, it is a testament to how far the medical establishment has perpetrated this fraud that I was about to do just that. We need to acknowledge the reality of the situation at the moment so that we can determine best how to end this. The reality is that loving, caring parents who want the best for their children are doing this, either because of social pressure, ignorance, an inability to acknowledge their own damaged penises, or some combination of all of the above. Let's not call them monsters, lets find the best way to reach out to new parents and make this stop."
Intactivists,30hdc6,ShaidarHaran2,8,Fri Mar 27 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"I liked that this article mentioned that circumcision concentrates remaining penile sensitivity on the underside of the penis. That's a point that almost everyone ignores, but it's significant both for changing what the penis feels but also for the resultant effect on how it makes men enjoy using their penises. When partners are facing each other during sex, leaving only the underside of the penis more sensitive makes men want to press away from the sensitive parts of the vulva. This is how circumcision tends to make men favor sex from behind more than they would with intact foreskin.    Incidentally, about the comments, if anyone here doesn't use facebook, doesn't ever want to use it, and doesn't want to see facebook comments anywhere on the internet, there's a file you can edit on your computer to disable facebook including facebook comments.  On Windows 7, the ""hosts file"" is \Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts. On linux, it's in /etc/hosts. For Apple OS X, here's Apple's info on it from their site. For other operating systems, you can just google ""[operating system name] hosts file"" for directions.  Wherever that file is, open it with a text editor and add the following two lines:    127.0.0.1 facebook.com 127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com   This will make your operating system unable to load facebook including comments on other sites. This disabling will be in effect for as long as that file contains those lines.  If you'd like, you can do the same with disqus.com too. Just add two more lines like the previous two but substitute disqus.com for facebook.com.  I did this for both those sites a long time ago."

Intactivists,30hdc6,dalkon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:34:50 2015 UTC,"The ridged bands of the foreskin contribute most of the feeling of the upper side of the penis, as well as mechanically connecting the upper and lower sides of the foreskin. That part of the foreskin is always destroyed by circumcision. Remaining sensitivity being localized to the underside is a result of destroying the foreskin while leaving the urethral cavernosa intact. This is unlikely to depend on what clamp is used.  The only significantly different way infant circumcision may be preformed is when surgeries are performed without the aid of any clamp. Infant circumcision performed without a clamp preserves the most tissue because it's more difficult to destroy as much tissue without seriously risking exsanguinating an infant. By limiting bleeding, tissue-crushing clamps allow more destructive surgeries to be performed. The Mogen clamp is the same as other tissue crushing clamps in this respect. The Mogen clamp also increases the likelihood of keloid scarring as a post-surgical complication and glans excision as a surgical accident. It's only beneficial feature is allowing the surgery to be performed more quickly than other clamps."

Intactivists,2zz2ld,dalkon,2,Mon Mar 23 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"I have cited this paper on reddit quite a bit. Here's how I have described it.   Since at least the 1950s, anthropologists have noted that male and female child genital surgeries appear to have had a common origin most likely in North Africa or the Middle East three to four millennia ago; in addition to appearing in almost entirely the same cultures for both sexes, child genital surgeries shared the same geographical spread until the modern era (DeMeo, 1997).  The idea that ancient religious genital surgery was always preventative (or even therapeutic) was only invented in the 19th century when religious genital surgery was medicalized and promoted as preventative medicine by circumcision activists like Jonathan Hutchinson, John Kellogg and Peter Remondino. In Judaism, male ritual genital cutting was originally described as a sacrifice performed for the promise of divine reward. The first and most explicit rationale for genital surgery mentioned in the Bible, Genesis 17, describes circumcision as a sacrifice performed for explicit rewards including: a large population (""I will multiply you greatly""), patriarchal political power (""you shall be the father of a multitude of nations""), and real estate (""The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you""). The promised rewards may have also included moral absolution, though that is less explicitly described (""walk before me faithfully and be blameless""), but it would fit this concept of moral absolution that circumcision was not made mandatory within Judaism until Joshua instituted in preparation for the conquest of Canaan. This timing also suggests that Genesis 17 was only authored after Joshua's mandate. In the same passage, the threat of punishment for failure to comply with the commandment was social isolation (""Any uncircumcised male [""including those born in your household or bought with money""], who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant"").  As DeMeo writes, genital cutting has always been associated strongly with extreme patriarchal authoritarian culture."

Intactivists,2zxm0b,dalkon,9,Sun Mar 22 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"I am not a lawyer. I did learn a little bit about this from talking to a lawyer with my boyfriend about suing for damages from his infant circumcision.  Was your surgery performed to ""the standard of care""? Do you have any complications (excluding being deprived of a valuable part of your penis)? If you incurred any major surgical errors from the surgery, you would have a much better case than if not.  If you're over the age of 19, it depends what state you live in whether you would need to challenge and prove standing first in order to be permitted to file a lawsuit.  The lawyer and legal subreddits on reddit appear to be defensively anti-foreskin, so I wouldn't expect much help from them.  If you're too old and your surgery was performed to ""the standard of care"", then you might be better off finding a friend whose child was circumcised (preferably at the same hospital) and helping them sue on their child's behalf. It would probably be ideal to sue for the medical fraud of failing to inform the parents that the foreskin is a sensory structure of the penis before taking their money to destroy it, but if you know someone whose child's circumcision was also not performed to the standard of care, they would be the most likely to win a large settlement. But whatever legal action you bring against a doctor or hospital who promotes nontherapeutic genital surgery, it should help all medical professionals think about the ethical implications of the surgery more rather than continuing to look only at the revenue it produces for them as they do now.

But whatever legal action you bring against a doctor or hospital who promotes nontherapeutic genital surgery, it should help all medical professionals think about the ethical implications of the surgery more rather than continuing to look only at the revenue it produces for them as they do now.   This is pretty much what I'm hoping to accomplish, along with, like I said, the personal gratification of knowing I made clear my displeasure about having this done to me against my consent as an infant. I don't have the kind of complications that would make a court case an obvious route, but the physical and psychological damage is real. Also, my frenulum was cut, which I'm especially pissed about, and so, since I'm under the impression that's not even necessary under any circumcision,  I thought that could also be part of my argument.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, I guess...) I don't know anyone with a baby boy in that kind of situation. In any case, I kind of want to do it myself for myself just to say I did, if that makes sense. Even if it goes nowhere, I just want to file the forms and be able to say that I sued them."
Intactivists,2zuo2d,dalkon,7,Sat Mar 21 23:05:35 2015 UTC,Dude. Telling an adult to chill out is a million times less offensive than putting a genital in your mouth without the owners consent.
Intactivists,2zuo2d,ParadiseSold,2,Sun Mar 22 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"The issue... is of competing notions of offensiveness. On the one hand, there’s the affront to religious freedom carried out by municipal interference in a centuries-old custom. On the other, there’s the profound offensiveness of unnecessarily exposing infants to disease, never mind the moral indecency of a grown man putting his lips to an infant’s penis. One might think the outrage bred from the latter offence would trump the religious indignation from the former. Evidently, in New York and elsewhere, it does not.  There are two reasons for that. The first, fairly obvious reason is the political power conferred through support from the Jewish community, especially from the highly organized ultra-Orthodox community, which comes out to vote in droves and often as a united bloc. A lengthy feature published in the November issue of the New Yorker described how political support from the Hasidic community in Brooklyn’s Borough Park ultimately led the elected district attorney to drop the ball — to put it mildly — on allegations of serial sexual abuse launched against a prominent cantor in the community. The implication is that ultra-Orthodox communities are generally left to police themselves, lest politicians face repercussions of too much interference at the polls.  The second reason is a general disinclination among the wider Jewish community to disavow practices within its own circles (and I say that as a member of said community). There’s logic behind that disinclination, of course, especially considering the ever-increasing incidents of anti-Semitism reported in Europe and beyond, including the Jewish cemetery that was desecrated in the German city of Oldenburg two weeks ago and the swastikas that were painted on cars in Montreal.  The perception is — and it may be true — that global hostility towards Jews is getting worse, not better. That in mind, it’s not unexpected that the wider Jewish community would not want to bring added attention to the fringe sects that delay flights so that ultra-Orthodox men don’t have to sit next to women on planes, or to the small group of mohels who suck blood from babies’ penises after circumcision. Generally speaking, the moderate majority stays quiet, lest they lure more negative attention to the Jewish community over a couple odious acts by a religious few. The question is, what’s more offensive?   The Hasidic community has been plagued with a lot more scandals than the single one she mentioned. I have noticed that mostly Jewish news sources have been filled with Haredi scandals for at least the past couple years. For at least a few years now, mainstream news sources have been avoiding talking about Haredi scandals. The idea presented in this article that the journalistic avoidance of their scandals is just about avoiding adding to the only very recent expansion of antisemitism is not very well supported.   Haredi sex abuse scandal revealed in NY:  After years of silence, 85 men from Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox community suspected of molesting 117 kids The Child-Rape Assembly Line This website has links to around 200 news stories about Haredi child abuse and especially sexual abuse from Jewish news sources: http://haloche.org/HOS2.html   It would seem that just as the Haredi hold themselves above ethics regarding infant oral genital contact, these are all examples of a religious community seemingly holding itself above any ethical standards.  * One of the complaints from parents of children who incurred serious infections from MBP was that they were not aware that it was going to be performed on the child. The consent forms, if they had been used, would have enforced parents at least acknowledging that they did know it was going to be performed. The fact this tiny regulation on the worst aspect of involuntary foreskin excision has been revoked due to political pressure is kind of unbelievable. I think everyone would agree that no other conservative religious group like the Amish or ultraconservative Muslims (like ISIS) could ever get away with oral-infant genital wound contact in the US."

It should be retractable by puberty though, if it isn't it could be wise to go see a doctor about it (there's a list of foreskin-friendly doctors around somewhere). Phimosis is pretty rare afaik, but even if it does occur it's not the end of the world either, the foreskin can be stretched with or without steroid cremes or under the shower (preferably with warm water). When it does retract, just wash underneath it like you would with any other body part but keep in mind not to use too much soap because that'll make it dry out (kinda like you'd clean a vagina, I think).      /u/underatreeoverahill already linked a PDF that sums it up pretty nicely imo.       the couple people I've told seem to freak out over hygiene       This is unfortunately not rare, people think foreskins are hard to clean when a foreskin is actually easier to clean that a circumcised penis because no dirt gets in."
Intactivists,2zt2bw,underatreeoverahill,9,Sat Mar 21 15:09:39 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, I just wanted to add that it's likely once he's retracting he will be in charge of his own bathing/cleaning so you won't be doing the cleaning under the foreskin, he will.

Intactivists,2zt2bw,widgetas,7,Sat Mar 21 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Hi - congrats on the imminent boy-child appearance.  Other people have given you lots of helpful pointers, so I'll just add something from a foreign perspective (UK). I realise you've already decided not to cut, but this might bolster your decision!  Circumcision is performed here mainly by religious groups, perhaps almost exclusively these days. Some older men are because it was ""the done thing"" decades ago. Worldwide the estimate is 80% of men are intact. You might here lots of statistics about diseases being more common in intact men, or this that and the other. There are even claims about STD rates being lower. This is, so far as I know, not the case or at least you can find statistics pointing in either direction.  The one thing to keep in mind, though, is that using circumcision as a preventative measure (for anything) should be the right of the individual. It should be up to a young man to make an informed decision about it when they're old enough.  As a doctor acquaintance of mine says: ""There's a reason boys are cut when they're babies - they can't say no."" I don't know about other places, but here in the UK a surgeon cannot perform an elective procedure on an (compos mentis) individual, even a child, if they do not consent.  I hope the above doesn't sound lecture-y or stern, I don't mean to be! You don't even have to believe anything I say here: it should all be available for you to find out online at least. That's the one take away point: don't believe anything people may tell you at face value, particularly those who want to cut your child. Research what they say via independent means. And, of course, remember that the vast majority of men are intact and do not suffer any ills, nor did they as children."
Intactivists,2zt2bw,BatFace,4,Sat Mar 21 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"You didn't lecture at all, and I totally agree with everything you've said. We believe it's just an old religious tradition that's turned into a habit here and we're atheists, I've never read anything credible that said intact males contract more diseases (just things random people have told us because they heard it on fox news or something, but we don't listen), and the main reason we decided no to circumcise is because we believe he should have the opportunity to make that decision for himself when he's old enough to understand the pros and cons of that decision, whatever that may be. We won't preach to him that our decision is the only right decision, just that we want it to be his decision because it's his body, not ours. Thanks so much for your input!"

Intactivists,2zt2bw,wufoo2,5,Sat Mar 21 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"Congrats!   My favorite resources are The Whole Network, Intact America, and Doctor's Opposing Circumcision. TWN and Intact America have facebook pages you could follow too.   The most common problem we've had with our son, now 3, is sometimes a bit of redness on the tip of his foreskin. Usually from him pulling on it or maybe rubbing on his clothes wrong. It gets asked about all the time on TWN. A bit of coconut oil clears it right up for us. Babies sometimes get yeast infections too, and intact men can get them easier than cut men, though my cut husband has had one a few times, it's not just something women get. If your son gets one, the smell usually tips me off before anything else, you can get OTC athlete's foot cream, as long as the ingredient is clotrimazole.   As others have said, just wipe the penis like a finger. In infants and usually toddlers the foreskin is attached to the glans of the penis the same way fingernails are attacked to the nailbed. As long as he can pee just fine the doctors don't need to ""just check"". IF his urethra opening is int he wrong spot it can be fixed when he is older if he wants/needs. The tip of the foreskin in a sphincter muscle, it will look closed tight most of the time and will relax open to let pee out.  I've had to keep an info booklet(Written by doctors for doctors, $5) from DOC(drs opposing circ) and the AAPs Care of the Uncircumcised Penis(This one is a bit wrong with average age of retraction being 10, and not unusual for it not to retract till late teens) in my diaper bag for doctor visits. We are military and so tend to have a new doctor every few month  to a year. I had to physically stop one from retracting my son, and she argued with me on weather or not I should be retracting to clean. All the rest (5 in total) have either argued with me or looked at me like I was crazy and asked questions which lead me to believe they'd never heard this info before.  I strongly recommend that you tell the doctor ""Do NOT mess with is foreskin at all."" BEFORE the doctors exams your son, it only takes a split second for him to forcibly retracted and some doctors/people don't seem to understand what retract means. My son wasn't fully retracted by the doctor, but she pulled it back hard enough that he was in pain for days and took 2 weeks to heal so that it didn't hurt to pee.  My son has never had a UTI, they are way more common in girls than boys, cut or uncut, but if he does get one and the doctor mentions circumcising just ask what he would do to treat a girl.   My understanding is a lot of boy start retracting between 3-5 and usually announce to their parents because they are proud of their cool new trick. I plan on explaining to my son to rinse it in the bath when/if that happens. If not, around puberty we'll talk about hygiene and masturbation and I or my husband will ask if his foreskin can retract, and tell him to rinse int he shower, though I can't imagine a teenage boy not playing with his penis in the shower. If it's not retracting there are options, stretching, with or without steroid creams, or in very very rare cases a very minor cut can be made to the foreskin to make it loose enough to retract properly.  Feel free to ask any questions. I probably know the answer or know where to find it.

Intactivists,2zt2bw,Psychobird7,5,Sat Mar 21 19:56:03 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, in the US, the ignorance of medical professionals is more likely to damage your child's foreskin than you are. Here's a British doctor's article about that: If Your Son Is Not Circumcised... Beware the Well-Baby Check  Many doctors and nurses don't have any awareness that they can damage the child's foreskin by forcibly retracting it. They generally don't learn anything about the foreskin in their education other than how to destroy it, and then they mistake evidence of the damage they cause as a reason for universal infant circumcision rather than ever understanding they damaged the child due to their ignorance.  To people freaking out over hygiene or the imagined difficulty in caring for a child with an intact penis, you might point them to this recent article about it.   Jennifer Rice is the mother of two sons. She had her oldest circumcised, but decided she didn't want to circumcise her second son.  ""With my oldest, after he came back from the surgery he wouldn't take the binky, he wouldn't nurse, he was very irritable,"" says Rice. ""With my second son, everything was very peaceful for him."" She also notes that her second was also much easier to keep clean.  ""With my first, you had to make sure his penis was Vaseline'd at every diaper change so that things wouldn't get stuck to it and it wouldn't get infected,"" she says. ""You had to touch it a lot. With my second son, we don't touch it at all. We'd just give him a bath and he's fine. We don't even clean it with soap; I just dunk him in warm water. He doesn't smell at all.""  Like many parents who choose to leave their sons uncircumcised, Rice experienced some backlash from her family, though she says that's all dissipated now. She even found that most doctors and nurses were receptive to her decision, and many of them congratulated her. ""I feel really proud of the decision that I made,"" she says."

Intactivists,2zm7bh,jacnorectangle,17,Thu Mar 19 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"The foreskin is naturally adhered to the glans for 95% of infants. That is a normal part of penile development that normally corrects itself without intervention by the age of 3. For a minority of boys this process takes longer to occur without any intervention, but it poses absolutely no health hazards in itself. In cases where it is problematic or uncomfortable, intervention need only consist of preputial adhesiolysis and monitoring to prevent formation of iatrogenic adhesion during healing. Iatrogenic adhesions are generally more severe, require surgery to correct and, while natural adhesions separate without leaving a mark, iatrogenic adhesions often cause scarring. The foreskins of infants are also proportionally much longer than they will be when the penis has developed more. This is a product of gestation. Failing to explain this to parents who don't know this is lying by omission.  This is not merely misinformation. Misinformation sounds innocent, like it might just be a mistake. When false information is used to deceive intentionally, disinformation is a more appropriate term. This is disinformation.  How can our doctors be so stupid or devious?

Would we be ok with the pro-cutting parent absconding with the child to have him circumcised?  The judge is an asshole, no doubt. His conduct has proven that. But do not forget that the mother signed a legally binding agreement not only consenting to the mutilation, but gave the father sole authority over its execution. The mother is stupid and the father is a vindictive prick. The only innocent here is the child and in our pro-cutting culture, no judge is going to see objection to circumcision as a compelling reason to void a perfectly legal parenting plan. At least not with the shit case her lawyers prevented.  Bottom line, I hate that this happening. I wish I could wave a magic wand and protect that boy. I wish I could un-sign the parenting plan for her. But she can't. She consented and now she is stuck in a untenable position.

None of the medical 'reasons' for circumcision matter one iota.  It is something that should be left up to that person to decide and they alone.

I have never felt so immediately happy that l posted a single thing, and l am very active in trying to enact change through social and online media and have been contacted by a great deal of people indicating l have been quite successful, so that is saying something.

Intactivists,2y6gex,Psychobird7,2,Tue Mar 10 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know.   As for not having an opportunity to defend himself until he's 18, I actually think that if he does get cut, when he's 12 or 13, he should assault the judge. That's a much better decision when he's far from 18.   It is even better if he manages to do it anonymously.   But I'm of the mind where if about 20 or 30 circumcised young adults went and anonymously assaulted (with knives, but not fatally, maybe just cutting the hands pretty thoroughly) their cutters, (or really just any cutting docs and claimed out loud that ""you cut my dick"" and made it known that's why they were doing it) that there would be a dramatic reduction in cutting in this country.   Really, I think part of the problem is that this violence is being visited upon babies, and the cutters think they are immune from physical repercussion, kinda like how people feel insulated from consequences when they're driving, and the go all road-ragey.   I see the cutting as an act that's done without any consequences- bullying that keeps happening because the bullied won't stick up for himself. Here, since it is a one-time thing for the bullied, somebody has to hit back (slice some doctors' palms up a bit) and they'll stop bullying the next generation."

If it isn't immediately available to parents (and isn't being pushed while the mother still can't walk properly), they will likely drop it. I wish I had data to back this up, but I don't, of course.    But if it does end up being done outside of a hospital setting because the doctors won't, bear in mind that in the USA, you can have ANYBODY YOU WANT CUT YOUR BOY'S DICK. There's no certificate you have to earn, or even a merit badge.   So if boys die from this, I think it would inspire helpful legislation.   Assaulting people to stop abortions (think abortion clinic bombing) didn't work because there's always some demand for abortions, for good reason. But there's no base-level demand to cut off your kid's dick. So just a little nudge that direction and the market for it will evaporate entirely (except for the Jews, until somebody cuts up a mohel a little bit. At least I certainly hope those fuckers aren't willing to endure personal danger)."

It ruins sex, and that's the main reason to be against it. If there were no benefit to having a foreskin, circumcision would make some sense."
Intactivists,2xue8v,mime454,7,Wed Mar 4 05:33:56 2015 UTC,"I think you run into a problem that it isolates circumcised men, and those are the most difficult (and most important) people to convince that circumcision is wrong. It is also more or less impossible to prove this objectively, because I can't even know how your experience of sex differs from mine, let alone how the experience of the general circumcised man differs from the experience of the general intact one.   Human rights arguments are:   Immediately accessible and palatable to everyone.  Not undermined by any science that may come out showing that circumcision has disease reducing potential.  Allow little moral leeway.    If the primary intactivist argument is that foreskin helps sex, then it necessarily opens us up to value calculations like [Moral permissibility of circumcision= disease reduction potentional-sexual value of foreskin].   The human rights argument, that circumcision should be a decision made by sexually aware men for their own bodies, is infinitely stronger and less open to interpretation."
Intactivists,2xue8v,numb3red,2,Wed Mar 4 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"While I see what you mean, the vaccine example can be applied.

Intactivists,2xue8v,mime454,3,Wed Mar 4 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"I believe that vaccination violates the same human right that circumcision does (the right to bodily autonomy) , but it does so for good reason, to ensure the child's right to life is protected.   Parents are the protectors of their children's human rights. Lots of their decisions require the prioritizing of one right over another. I believe that decisions that can be left to the individual when he is an adult without causing harm should be left to the individual.   Almost everyone in the western world already agrees with this assumption. And it's a lot easier to convince people that this principle applies to the penis as it does to the rest of the body than it is to convince perfectly happy circumcised men that they're missing something from sex."
Intactivists,2xue8v,numb3red,3,Wed Mar 4 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. It's really unfortunate how far people will go to deny they were wronged. On informative videos that cover every single argument the comment section will still have people using the same arguments."

Yes and no. Vaccination isn't body modification, circumcision is. There's also a difference between say catching Tetanus and a UTI, the first could well kill you, the second won't unless left unchecked.      Not being vaccinated can kill you, not being circumcised... won't as far as I'm aware."
Intactivists,2xue8v,mime454,4,Wed Mar 4 19:49:33 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant about the right to life.

I'm pro-vaccine because I believe the child's right to not die from a disease is more important than the right to not receive medical treatment not consented to. An adult has the right to decide to refuse needed medical treatment. But when the child is under guardianship, the prioritization of rights falls to the parents or the state."

Where no one actually knows anything about female genital cutting, the popular argument against the practices are largely worthless emotional photos and emotional but inaccurate words—like this councilor's ignorant ""Would you like your fanny sliced off?"" Those who actually understand female genital cutting know that many traditions of cutting girls include significantly less severe surgeries than male circumcision like clitoral hood excision and non-excisive incisions.  People have been saying that male and female genital cutting are incomparable in order to promote male circumcision since the 1980s when the movement against circumcision began to gain traction as a movement against child genital cutting for both sexes with the publication of Wallerstein's Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy (1980).   The ethical problem with genital cutting for both sexes is the lack of consent in destroying a part of a child's body. Americans have led an effort to deny the reality of female genital cutting because it offends the majority here who identify with male genital cutting. Just as Jewish culture rightly regards itself as the origin of routine male genital cutting in Anglophone countries, the US regards itself as the advocate of the surgery to the world. These are strong cultural biases that make even intelligent and otherwise highly competent doctors unwilling to accept the reality of female genital cutting.

Without a less clunky sounding term, I'm inclined to call it anti-foreskin bigotry because that encompasses anti-European, anti-Latino, anti-Asian and all the other varieties of bigotry combined.  * Classism was also a key component of anti-foreskin bigotry in the US in the past. That has largely been forgotten because Medicaid brought (nontherapeutic) infant foreskin excision to those without health insurance in 1965. People born in the '50s and earlier may remember this classism. That ""hilarious"" joke about redneck-incest circumcision appears to be a remnant of that classism, but it doesn't even reference anything real anymore as urban areas are now considerably less circumcising than rural.

For some reason, I doubt they would have considered her opinion too valueless to publish if she had concluded by endorsing the surgery rather than questioning it. She wrote:   The main reason we have circumcision in the US today is not the health benefits [meaning the lack thereof]. It’s because we’re used to it. After all, if circumcision is not definitively preventing a life-threatening issue that cannot be prevented by other means, can removal of a body part without the agreement of the child be justified? We are so accustomed to the practice that operating on an infant so that he resembles his father seems acceptable. I’ve heard many people give this as their reason. It isn’t a good one.  It’s disconcerting to think that circumcising infant boys may be a violation of their human rights. We castigate cultures that practise female genital mutilation (FGM). Rightfully so: no one should be coerced into such a violation. But removal of the clitoral hood, one form of FGM, is anatomically analogous to removal of the foreskin. Some forms of FGM, such as nicking or scratching the female genitalia, are unequivocally deemed a human rights violation but are even milder than the foreskin removal done in US hospitals.  Thinking about male circumcision as an unnecessary and irreversible surgery forced on infants, I can’t but hope that the troubled history of the foreskin will come to an end, and that the foreskin will be known for its presence rather than its absence. I understand why some people demand an immediate end to circumcision. And I understand why a man would stand on a street corner for hours on a cold day wearing red-stained trousers, angry at what was done to him without his agreement and trying to prevent other men from suffering the same fate.     While overall quite good, this article also contained a large number of errors or odd omissions. Most notably, it seemed odd this article ignored the most shocking finding of Gairdner (1949) which was that an average of 16 infants per year had been dying of the surgery for many years at that point in the UK. That was not an estimate. It reported only recorded infant deaths. The fatality rate was very important in the NHS decision against subsidzing the ""preventative"" surgery.  It also ignored the central question of the debate which is: Why have the US medical authorities who have promoted foreskin excision ignored the fundamental question of performing the surgery involuntarily and nontherapeutically? Is the foreskin a sensory structure of the penis? Is the foreskin a part of the body that men can be permitted to value?"

Intactivists,2wpboz,dalkon,9,Sat Feb 21 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"This is Jenny Kutner's followup to her ridiculous joke of journalism that was her anti-foreskin/pro-infant surgery blog post from the week before, where she interviewed a guy who obviously had some problem with his foreskin that he never described adequately leaving it to everyone to assume that all men with intact foreskin have problems like him. This journalist would appear to have absolutely no concept of what the foreskin is like, which made her clueless about what questions to ask that man to determine why he chose surgery. Without any concept of what questions to ask, she failed to explain the reality of his situation instead playing it up as anti-foreskin propaganda.  This post does begin to make up for that, but it also makes inexplicable errors like especially conflating intactivists with men performing non-surgical penile skin expansion (""foreskin restoration""). We are obviously distinct groups. Restorers tend to be intactivists, but intactivism is a much larger group than restorers.  All this raises a more important point about journalism. Even more important than ignorance about the foreskin itself, journalists who are ignorant of the existence of the anti-foreskin movement tend to write terrible articles about intactivism. That is Ms. Kutner's greatest ignorance compromising her journalism here.   Of all people journalists really need to know more about Edgar Schoen, Brian Morris, Jake Waskett, Vernon Quaintance, Robert Bailey, Bertran Auvert, Helen Weiss, Daniel Halperin, John Krieger, countless JHU faculty and the rest of the anti-foreskin movement. What could we do to increase awareness of the anti-foreskin movement? Why don't more people acknowledge the existence of the movement of anti-foreskin activists?  * I thought the best point this interview made was the men explaining the massively positive perceptual change that takes place when the layered aspect of the head of the penis has been regained from penile skin expansion."

There were only a couple mistakes that I thought were significant, both in this sentence:   When its gets hard, the foreskin secretes lubrication that allows the skin to slide back and forth against the shaft.   It's weird how many people are confused about this simple point. The foreskin does not slide like the eyelid does or like a condom full of lube. Its linear motion is not sliding but rather it is actually rolling with an elegant, fluid motion that's generally been referred to as gliding. It is this frictionless motion of the foreskin that allows it to act as if it were lubricant: NSFW diagram. The foreskin does not secrete lubricant. Except for the presence of prostatic fluid which is produced by the prostate with arousal, the foreskin is dry. It is much drier than uninformed people think. The glans with intact foreskin is not actually wet. It is just moisturized like healthy skin rather than being more weathered-looking like knees tend to be.  Overall, I thought it was an excellent article."

Reading through this gave me deja vu in regards to many of the debates I've had on the topic of male circumcision. I found this quote particularly moving;   As with male circumcision, there are a minority of those who are against the practice and consider circumcision to be “mutilation”.  While western activists ignore the voices and claims of violence made by male opponents to male circumcision they allow only those minority of women who are opposed to the practice of female circumcision to speak for the vast majority of us who are quite happy with our genitalia, thank you, and support our traditions. - See more at: http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/?p=72721#sthash.5HrxroFf.dpuf   Emphasis my own.

Intactivists,2vtfqu,dalkon,2,Fri Feb 13 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"I wrote a long comment on this post in /r/canada:   Circumcision isn’t something I’d ever really thought about until after I had my son. I remember being asked by an acquaintance, when James was just a few weeks old, whether I’d taken him in for the snip yet. “Of course not,” I answered without hesitation. “Why would I? It’s barbaric.” And then I watched as the woman’s face folded itself into a pursed little smile and she muttered something about her two boys being circumcised “for cultural reasons,” before turning away from me altogether.   I can understand her impulse to respond that way, but it would have been a lot more useful for the woman promoting the surgery if she could have explained why the surgery is unethical instead of simply using the judgmental word, barbaric. If she had been better prepared, she might have actually persuaded the other woman that non-therapeutic circumcision is unethical with only a few sentences.  The penile foreskin is not a congenital pathological deformity necessitating infant genital surgery despite the fact that doctors who were themselves circumcised tend to believe that it is (Muller, 2010). The foreskin is a sensory structure of the penis (Sorrells, 2007; Taylor, 1996; Meislahn & Taylor, 2004; Podnar, 2012; Bensley & Boyle, 2001; Bronselaer, 2013; Cold & McGrath, 1999; Crosby & Charnigo, 2013). Quoting Van Howe (2013):   Anatomically, the foreskin is highly erogenous, pentalaminar, specialized, junctional (transitional) tissue. Other transitional tissues in the body include the lips and eyelids. These transitional tissues all have a high concentration of fine-touch neuroreceptors at the junction of internal (mucosal) surfaces with external (epidermal) surfaces. [The junction area feels like the primary focal point of the penis. The junction area after the surgery is the surgical scar instead of the foreskin.] In the 19th century, physicians, recognizing that the foreskin was the most sensitive portion of the penis, recommended its removal as a ""cure"" for masturbation. Only recently was the ridged band of the prepuce, which is completely removed by circumcision, identified as containing nearly all of the penis's fine-touch neuroreceptors.   Numerous medical organizations have explicitly stated that the foreskin is an important sensory structure of the penis. In 2009 the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia wrote that the foreskin ""is rich in specialized sensory nerve endings and erogenous tissue. Circumcision is painful, and puts the patient at risk for complications ranging from minor, as in mild local infections, to more serious such as injury to the penis, meatal stenosis, urinary retention, urinary tract infection and, rarely, even hemorrhage leading to death."" In 2010, the Royal Dutch Medical Association stated that the foreskin is ""a complex, erotogenic structure that plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts, such as penetrative intercourse and masturbation"". The Royal Australasian College of Physicians wrote, ""The foreskin has two main functions. Firstly it exists to protect the glans penis. Secondly the foreskin is a primary sensory part of the penis, containing some of the most sensitive areas of the penis."" The Danish Medical Association (Lægeforeningen) and Danish Society of Family Physicians (Dansk Selskab for Almen Medicin) have recommended non-therapeutic male circumcision should wait until the boy or young man is old enough to provide informed consent. Circumcision which is not medically indicated is a mutilation and a violation and should be restricted to being performed with consent. The British Medical Association informational literature states: ""It is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. … Very similar arguments are also used to try and justify very harmful cultural procedures, such as female genital mutilation or ritual scarification. Furthermore, the harm of denying a person the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual’s relationship with his parents and the medical profession if he feels harmed by the procedure. … Parental preference alone is not sufficient justification for performing a surgical procedure on a child."" Representing Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish clinical sexologists, in 2013 the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology stated:   The penile foreskin is a natural and integral part of the normal male genitalia. The foreskin has a number of important protective and sexual functions. It protects the penile glans against trauma and contributes to the natural functioning of the penis during sexual activity. Ancient historic accounts and recent scientific evidence leave little doubt that during sexual activity the foreskin is a functional and highly sensitive, erogenous structure, capable of providing pleasure to its owner and his potential partners.  As clinical sexologists, we are concerned about the human rights aspects associated with the practice of non-therapeutic circumcision of young boys. To cut off the penile foreskin in a boy with normal, healthy genitalia deprives him of his right to grow up and make his own informed decision. Unless there are compelling medical reasons to operate before a boy reaches an age and a level of maturity at which he is capable of providing informed consent, the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity.  Every person's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her sexual autonomy.   On the other side of the debate, only a handful of US and US-dominated medical organizations have chosen to promote infant genital surgery as if it were medical rather than cultural. There are weird cultural-historical reasons for such wildly different medical opinions of the foreskin. The movement to pathologize the foreskin was very successful in the US and other Anglophone countries in the past in large part because of Victorian sexual repressiveness. Here's a book about routine infant circumcision in the UK: A Surgical Temptation: The Demonization of the Foreskin and the Rise of Circumcision in Britain. And here's a medical history paper about the tradition in NZ: The universal condition: medical constructions of 'congenital phimosis' in twentieth century New Zealand and their implications for child rearing. (Watson, 2014). In addition to Canada, other countries had high rates of routine infant genital surgery in the past including NZ, Australia and the UK. The tradition would probably have died out a long time ago if some ax-grinding researchers in the US were not publishing medical research to pathologize the foreskin since the 19th century."
Intactivists,2vtfbv,dalkon,3,Fri Feb 13 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel like the querent submitted this question in order to present intactivism as ignorant or uninformed.  The need for lubrication for masturbation varies with the tightness of the penile skin (explanation in /r/intactivists/wiki). The surgery that tightens the skin of the penis obviously makes some men need lube. It's bothersome this sexual expert did not mention that tight cuts prevent the skin from moving when the penis is erect.  Circumcised foreskin has also been found to correlate with sexual lubrication issues by at least a couple of studies, a small study in Australia and a large one in Denmark (Bensley & Boyle, 2003; Frisch, 2011). The incidence of these problems is still not very high, but it was significantly higher. Neither of these were studies of adults who underwent adult circumcision as the author implied. Both were surveys of both women and men.   The most ready explanation of these findings would acknowledge that the foreskin is a part of the penis, which occupies space which accounts for some of the girth of the penis. It also normally moves very easily to make the surface of the penis move without friction. The foreskin essentially acts like lubrication in allowing the surface of the penis to move without friction (Taves, 2002; Garcia, 1995). Filling the space where the foreskin does also helps to retain lubrication in front of the penis rather than pumping it out more efficiently as the profile of the circumcised penis has been shown to do by Gallup (2003).  The loss of sensitivity and the foreskin-mechanism of the human penis is not as idle a concern as it may appear to be from the fact that most men whose foreskins were circumcised appear to be happy with their penile sensitivity. A number of studies have suggested men with intact foreskin are less resistant to using condoms (Van Howe, 1999, Gemmel & Boyle, 2001, Crosby & Charnigo, 2013, Abbott, 2013). Ms. Herbenick might be especially unreceptive to that point as she actually took part in a study that found while circumcision offered no STD benefit to gay men, it had the opposite effect on condom use in their sample. If it was real, this might have been an effect of the formerly high correlation of condom use in gay porn with circumcision, or the researchers might have intentionally or unintentionally included an unrepresentatively high fraction of men with defective foreskins skewing their results.

He finally apologized in as close to a sincere was as he could over thanksgiving break (late November 2014), but he's tried so hard to lie, misinterpret, and deny to weasel his way out of responsibility that it feels very much insincere. I'm still extremely angry with him, so I told him a few weeks ago not to talk to me anymore.   I have forgiven my mother as well as I can. I will probably never forgive my father. It was mostly his decision, and he has been a coward about taking responsibility for this decision. During our talks, he repeatedly tried to minimize the harm he's done to me and deflect responsibility for his decision. The level of dishonesty he's employed in talking about this has been sort of eye-opening. At this point, there's not much he could do for me to forgive him.   He taught me, through his own actions, that one is responsible for one's actions and the consequences of those actions, whether intentional or unintentional.

Such a clinical euphemism), beyond idly pondering it and shuddering in disgust, the chances are, I'd barely give the matter a second thought, and why should I? It wouldn't be my problem. To anyone who brings up abortion to justify circumcision, I ask this: If all babies want to be born, as these people say , then how many baby boys want to be circumcised?

If you are pro-life and you believe that it's wrong to harm babies, then you logically must be anti-circumcision because we need to protect babies from harm and circumcision is harmful to babies.  It's so annoying when people try to compare the circumcision debate and the abortion debate.  It all boils down to the fact that the abortion debate really stems from philosophical question that can never truly come to a clear answer: when does life begin? Some people might argue that life begins at conception, others might argue that life begins when there's a heartbeat or brain activity or when the fetus can be viable outside of the womb, others might argue that life begin when the baby is born. There are so many answers to this question, and since it's really a philosophical debate, it's never going to be resolved  I don't want to get into the abortion debate because I see it for what it is: a very complex and open-ended philosophical debate.

Now due to some completely hypothetical problem, you're forced to choose between the gestating baby or your existing child, who, for the sake of convenience, is 9 years old.

He obviously thought he had gotten away with it for three decades, he clearly didn't ever expect me to question him about it, which as far as I'm concerned, speaks to his arrogance. The first thing he said was stutter ""There are other, more important things to worry about"" I told him that with that logic, one could use that argument to avoid almost any issue, besides, there must have been more other, more important things to worry about. Given that I was a sickly kid who was lucky to be alive, and it was done a few months after I was born, he must have been counting the days for me to get strong enough, which is really fucked up. According to my mother, he just brought up the topic unexpectedly when they were talking about something else (he still does this, even today) Abruptly, he just said ""[I'm] getting circumcised. My mother tried to dissuade him and mentioned that no one in her family is circumcised. He just said ""Well, that's you guys. I'm circumcised, and so is my dad"", as though his side of the family are so important. Most of them are just as selfish as he is.  I told him about the difficulties I've been having due to circumcision and about some of the research I've done on the subject. In a condescending tone, my father said ""Don't believe everything you read."" I wanted to shout at him, but I kept my cool and said that I'm not an idiot. The research I've done only confirms the obvious. I've read dozens of accounts by other men that could almost have been written by me. He made a bunch of excuses, including ""It's African, I'm African, it's tradition, it's like a baptism"". I asked him what the hell any of that tradition crap is supposed to mean to a kid born an raised in London, and pointed out that for a man who sneers at religion, he's just as bad as religious adherants. Call it tradition or religion, they both amount to the same thing. You're doing something for no other reason than a bunch of dead idiots used to do it. Regarding the ""baptism"" thing, that's rich because my mother has always said that she wanted me christened, but my father forbade it, and presumably, by extension, my younger brothers, too. A classic example of his selfishness. He couldn't even indulge her in this little thing that is utterly meaningless if you don't believe in it, and has no effect at all, yet he demanded to have me disfigured with his ""tradition"". He brought up that my two youngest brothers are intact, as though he wanted a medal for it. I pointed out that I know this, given that we all used to have to bathe together. I asked why the hell didn't he do it to them. He said he didn't have the money when they were born. This made me furious. They get to be normal, not because our father decided to stop thinking of himself, but  because he couldn't afford to have them disfigured. If he'd learned something by the time they were born, I might actually have some respect for him, but he didn't make the right decision, so much as not make the wrong decision because it happened to be inconvenient for him at the time."

If you read some verifiable journals from the EU it's not as bad as what online people say.  Don't think your a sexual cripple, unless your mutilation was particularly bad you should still be able to feel somthinf  If you restore you can probably get within a standard deviation of the real deal in terms of sensitity. It's the kernization of the glans that causes the real issues"

I doubt a flap of stretched skin will make that big a difference, from nothing to actually enjoying myself. I've only got something like 4000 nerves left, and even if I only feel 2000 and restoring will double my sensitivity, I feel nothing anyways so it'll still probably be nothing. At least, nothing compared to 25000 nerves, and back arching, mind numbing pleasure."
Intactivists,2vbqh9,aPseudonymPho,4,Tue Feb 10 07:12:30 2015 UTC,"I used to think that too but then I tried masturbating by rubbing the glans by itself and I couldn't get any pleasure from it. It worked only if I also stroked my hand past the inner foreskin area. So I think it's the opposite. Most of the pleasure comes from the inner skin and frenulum. And there was a study saying the glans is protopathic, meaning it only senses pain and temperature."
Intactivists,2vbqh9,TooFewSecrets,3,Tue Feb 10 07:41:24 2015 UTC,And herein lies the problem I previously mentioned.  That study you are talking about did not say it was protopathic. They said it contained more protopathic nerve ends than normal. Not that it was incabable of feeling pleasure. I have no innner skin and no frenulum and I still feel stuff. I restored though.
Intactivists,2vbqh9,aPseudonymPho,4,Tue Feb 10 07:51:31 2015 UTC,"Every study I've seen regarding the innervation of the glans says that it is primarily protopathic, possessing little to no fine touch receptors, genital receptors, etc.   As I'm sure you know, protopathic touch sensitivity does still include sensitivity to a kind of ""rubbing"". I think this is why both cut and intact people say their glans is the most sensitive; they're not really paying attention to what's happening when they masturbate (of course that is speculation though).  The foreskin simultaneously stimulates and is stimulated by the glans. The stretch receptors are at their maximum expansion when being retracted over the glans, which is a process that simultaneously stimulates the glans itself with the rubbing type stimulation it can actually perceive, and the foreskins fine touch receptors as it is pulled back. The frenulum (more specifically, the frenular delta) is involved in this entire mechanism also. They all work in concert, but given the locality of these parts at the time the sensation seems to originate from the glans.  Circumcised guys often stimulate their glans directly, triggering a similar response. However without the foreskin and its structures aiding, the locality of that sensation is much more concentrated in the glans itself.   My sensation is entirely from my foreskin remnant. My glans is not sensitive at all. I'm well through my restoration and my glans has regained more sensitivity, but the real money has come from regaining the gliding mechanism. Stimulating my head with my remaining foreskin tissue is incontestably better than either stimulating the glans or foreskin tissue alone. That said, stimulating my foreskin tissue alone is still better than my glans, as I was left with a fair amount of inner mucousa membrane.  Just my thoughts / experience on the matter."
Intactivists,2vbqh9,TooFewSecrets,2,Tue Feb 10 07:07:01 2015 UTC,"My glans might actually be protopathic, considering how little I feel with it."
Intactivists,2vbqh9,aPseudonymPho,2,Tue Feb 10 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"The glans is protopathic. All available scientific evidence says so, despite popular anecdote. What people fail to realize (in my opinion) is that the foreskin is part of the penile system, and to distinguish the locale of sensation in that system is difficult. The average person will not do a good job of that, strictly by thinking about how they masturbate. You need to design an experiment in which parts of the penis are isolated and stimulated by themselves. It is from these kinds of tests the data is sourced, and as such that is where the protopathic nature of the glans is elucidated.   This is what I mean in a bit more detail."

When stimulated through my restored foreskin, the combined stimulation is much better than either by themselves, and really lends credence in my mind to the currently understood function of the foreskin as a piece of the entire penile mechanism.

Intactivists,2vbqh9,TooFewSecrets,2,Wed Feb 11 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yup I did, as in the comment I linked from elsewhere in this thread, I go a bit more in depth as to how the glans can be both protopathic and sexually sensitive, while also being relatively less sexually sensitive than the foreskin. That would be the paragraph you quoted P:   How long did it take you to figure that out? I mean that's how it feels, but is it really obvious?   To be honest, it really didn't take that long to figure out. At the risk of sounding like a guy whose priorities are all fucked up in life, I will admit that I've spent a sizeable amount of time researching and investigating the penile anatomy, physiology, and histology in all respects. I know far more about the intact penis than I would say 95% of the intact population does (to pull a number out of my ass).   When you understand what the foreskin does (how it retracts back over the penile tissues and the forward again into resting position), how it fits into the penile anatomy, and what it looks like at a cellular level, it becomes incredibly obvious what it's there for and how it all works together. The idea that ""form follows function"" is absolutely fundamental to biology. As a practicing biochemist, once I saw the full picture it was simply a matter of 1+1 = ?  Secondly, my own experience comes into the picture as well. I am circumcised, but I would be lying if I said I didn't deeply wish and dream to know what it was like to be intact. I have two very close friends (I consider them family, my brothers) who are both intact, and they've been kind enough to entertain all of my deepest curiosities and questions about their anatomy. That, with all the research I've done, and my own experiences restoring my foreskin led me to the conclusions you've quoted above. In my mind, it is the only logical and rational explanation.   It didn't come to me all at once, but grew over time as I collected more information and became increasingly certain I was ""barking up the right tree"" so to speak."

Your experiment seems to be inline with everything I've read and understand about the histology, anatomy and physiology of the penis / foreskin (which is quite a bit I'd assure you), and my own experiences.  If you'd like to take it a step further, experiment with different kinds of touch. Expose your glans, and without touching any part of your penis that isnt the glans (so none of the inner mucousal tissues), try to see how lightly you can press with say, a pencil, before you feel it. Try with something relatively hot (put a spoon in warm water, dry it, then apply), and then cold (same thing with ice water). Then try to rub gently, in one direction with some object, and see how that feels. Make sure you are NOT using your own hands, because it will be tough to very accurately determine what is penile sensation and what is from the fine touch receptors of your fingertips.   Repeat the above with your foreskin at different parts. Try the frenulum, try the section of your foreskin where it opens and rolls over back to the other side (the ridged band), and more shaft oriented tissues. You can do the same thing in a sexual context, but simply rubbing a very small part of your penis and seeing how you respond. Start with your glans, and work your way around to other parts / areas. I'd be interested to see what you find the results to be."

Male circumcision is not the HIV 'vaccine' we have been waiting for!. Future HIV Ther. 2008. 2(3), 193-199. Boyle GJ, Hill G. Sub-Saharan African randomised clinical trials into male circumcision and HIV transmission: methodological, ethical and legal concerns. J Law Med. 2011. Dec;19(2):316-34. Van Howe & Storms (2011) wrote:     If the RCTs are to be believed and circumcision provides 50% to 60% protection from sexually transmitted HIV infection, then the impact of circumcision should be readily apparent in the general population. This is not the case. If the national survey data that are available from 19 [African] countries are combined in a meta-analysis... the risk of a genitally intact man having HIV is an odds ratio of 1.10 (95%CI=0.83-1.46), indicating that on a general population level, circumcision has no association with risk of HIV infection.   Among developed nations, the United States has the highest rate of circumcision and the highest rate of heterosexually transmitted HIV. Among English-speaking developed nations there is a significant positive association between neonatal circumcision rates and HIV prevalence. On a population level, circumcision has not been found to be an effective measure [both globally and in Africa]   This simple graphic comparison of heterosexual HIV transmission in the US compared to Europe shows how obviously misguided the idea of using male genital cutting to try to limit heterosexual HIV transmission is. The goal of routine foreskin excision is to reduce the size of the blue bar, female-to-male transmission, but look at the difference between male-to-female transmission between the circumcising culture and the one with body autonomy.  This is simple to understand. People are more willing to practice use condoms when the risks are more equitable for both partners. When women are thought to bear more of the risk, it makes it incumbent upon them to be both assertive enough and pro-condom in order to compensate for the fact that men see less benefit in using condoms. Naturally the net effect of this is increased STD transmission rates despite any minor benefit foreskin excision might have (especially for the minority for whom it is semi-therapeutic)."

Intactivists,2uf8co,dalkon,2,Sun Feb 1 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, gay slurs would have been a lot more appropriate in the title than jokes.  As this link notes, in the Old Testament, mandatory circumcision was only instituted by Joshua to prepare men for war. The timing of instituting mandatory circumcision raises an interesting question. Why was circumcision, which had not been considered terribly important suddenly made mandatory immediately prior to warfare? The linked essay does not even raise that question, but the ready explanation is an idea propounded by rabbis later that circumcision granted absolution for sins. This seems like an extremely important concept that has to-date been completely ignored in the debate about religious genital cutting.   The reason circumcision was the most important preparation for genocide was because it was considered a loophole around morality.   The existence of such a loophole either destroys the whole religious moral system (which was likely the case for some period of time), or it requires another loophole for the loophole to reestablish the negated religious rationale for morality. In Judaism, they chose the latter option, a loophole for the loophole. This idea is that extremely wicked men are able to be held accountable in the afterlife for their sins in this life only by supposing them able to become spiritually un-circumcised in the afterlife. Besides retaining the original circumcision absolution concept instead of questioning it, this loophole adds more circumcision reinforcing principles, namely: immorality makes men uncircumcised, and foreskin is sin.  Here is a Jewish scholar's take on the issue (that is understandably extremely favorable to Judaism about everything): Cohen 2005.  Knowledge of the Jewish concept of morality regarding circumcision might not have been lost on medieval European Christians which might explain some of their negative reactions, but I don't know of any source describing the role this played in inter-religious relations. Circumcision was also considered mutilation outside of cutting cultures through most of history. *** Glick and Gilman have written about the reaction to circumcision as mutilation being a key part of historical negative reactions to the Jews.  These religious insights are just one of many areas where learning more about history, religion and culture can make intactivism stronger. For religious people, health and hygiene are only superficial arguments that they now cling to strongly to avoid considering religious reasons. Their primary reasons for cutting were considered unethical more than a century ago. The are so unethical, they would prefer not discussing them openly.  What should it have done to the covenant to change the form of genital cutting in the 2nd century? What difference does the change in intended purpose make?   * I guess I should say that I don't mean this moral loophole concept to sound as judgmental as it probably does. Christianity's loophole is simply asking God for forgiveness. I'd assume Islam must do something similar? In any case, it's not like making all morality contingent upon something unrelated (whether foreskin length, empathy/repentant state of mind, etc.) is much different in terms of ethical nonsense from many other points from the Bible that everyone now rightly considers abhorrent like condoning slavery or punishing adultery with death. ** Making grace accessible by state-of-mind is at least a step toward existentialism and recognizing that the most important moral concepts are our own creations that are inherently independent of any religions. *** Of course there is Christian existentialism too. I really only know I don't know enough about this to do more than ask questions like: How can Judaism conceive of the foreskin length as immorality itself? It seems like a reaction to Hellenistic sexual aesthetics.  Besides moral absolution, the more direct idea that is also considered unethical by contemporary standards is the covenant itself, Genesis 17 in which Abraham is promised patriarchal power, military victory and real estate in exchange for infant circumcision. Genesis 17 could also be referencing the moral-absolution concept in its word choice, blameless, but that's not very clear. ** The concept of a ruler using mandatory involuntary child genital cutting to bargain with his deity would not be considered ethical by contemporary standards.   *** By the 19th century, circumcision for the stated religious reasons seemed so unethical that it was driving people away from the religion that insisted on it and insisted that it not be performed with antiseptic techniques. In evidence of this, Abraham Geiger, a prominent Hebrew theologian, wrote to his friend Zuns of Vienna:   To show as you do such a decided partisanship in favor of circumcision, because it always stood and still stands in high estimation, that I can not do. It will always remain a barbarous, bloody act, which fills the father with anxiety, and is contemplated by the mother with a sickening feeling. The inward satisfaction of bringing a sacrifice which used to sanctify the act has vanished among us, it being too coarse to deserve continuance. Though the religious sentiment may have clung to it with all its fibers, at the present time it has no other hold than usage and fear, and for these we are not willing to build temples.   Those are stronger words against circumcision than most intactivists use.    **** When I started writing this comment, I didn't intend to condemn religion and religious moral systems. While I consider the moral system of the Old Testament flawed for placing such obviously irrational emphasis on foreskin excision and I think Paul and Augustine would seem to agree, religion has also crafted very effective and beautiful moral ideas like especially the simplest and most elegant moral system, the Golden Rule. The ethics of reciprocity or Golden Rule was Jesus's summary of the morality of the Old Testament stated in Matthew and Luke as well as in Leviticus and the Deuterocanonical (or apocryphal depending on the denomination of Christianity) texts, Tobit and Sirach."

Intactivists,2u2slk,Griever114,10,Thu Jan 29 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you* for posting this. This is good to point out an example of very unpersuasive intactivism. This line of thought can make intactivism look uninformed, and ""follow the money"" sounds like someone was trying way too hard.   Yes, neonatal foreskin is a valuable raw material for both biotech and biomedical industries. Most people don't know that, so it's surprising. It seems like this could be relevant to the promotion of the surgery in poor countries in particular. Without more than a trace of cynicism, promoting routine/non-therapeutic circumcision in poorer countries could be viewed as lowering material costs for the companies that use neonatal genital tissue, but to be clear, that is absolutely not the reason why the surgery is done in the US, the only nation with routine infant genital surgery as well as the only nation to take up anti-foreskin activism almost as if it were a national cause. * (If that sounds overstated, consider South Korea, look at the recent US promotion by medical authorities, or look at our popular media.)  Foreskin excision is done in the US for a number of reasons. The more obvious financial reasons for the surgery are private health insurance and Medicaid coverage for routine/non-therapeutic genital modification. Insurance and Medicaid coverage for this non-therapeutic/routine surgery have encouraged some doctors and hospital administrators to view the child's foreskin as if it were money. That sounds like it should be a joke. It's not. Non-therapeutic/routine infant circumcision can add up to a huge amount of money for doctors and hospitals for a relatively insignificant amount of effort on their parts. For instance, performing infant surgeries for only a few hours a day, a doctor could gross over a million dollars a year doing nothing else. Especially in the past, many US hospitals have treated routine infant genital surgery as a default part of the bill for male births. In many parents' stories you can find on the internet, you'll notice people mentioning their insurance was billed for it even though it wasn't performed. The US military doctor and anti-foreskin activist who performed very obviously biased research in the 1980s exaggerating the effect on infant UTI rate, Thomas Wiswell explained it clearly:   I have some good friends who are obstetricians outside the military, and they look at a foreskin and almost see a $125 price tag on it. Each one is that much money. Heck, if you do 10 a week, that's over $1,000 a week, and they don't take that much time.    Dr.Thomas Wiswell, quoted in ""The Age-Old Question of Circumcision"" by Betsy A. Lehman, Boston Globe, June 22, 1987, p. 43   Tracing the history of foreskin-as-money back further, anti-foreskin activist Allan Guttmacher also explained financial and other motives. This is from the annotated timeline of circumcision in the wiki (linked in the sidebar):  In 1941, Allan F. Guttmacher promoted mass foreskin excision as a means of ""blunting male sexual sensitivity."" He also implied incorrectly that an infant's intact foreskin needs to be forcibly retracted to be scrubbed daily. This was an imperative to damage children's genitals from a medical authority, the doctor-editor of a parenting magazine and the founder of Planned Parenthood. He claimed that failing to treat a child by damaging his foreskin would inevitably lead to foreskin deformity (phimosis). Supporting the anti-masturbation rationale for the surgery, he wrote:   [Circumcision] does not necessitate handling of the penis by the child himself and therefore does not focus the male's attention on his own genitals. Masturbation is considered less likely.   He minimized the importance of consent by mentioning only in passing that some doctors performed the surgery without even thinking of obtaining permission or telling the parents prior:   Some doctors make a practice of routine circumcision unless specific objection is raised by the parents, while others first consult the parents in order to discover their wishes.   When consent is not even a consideration, there must not have been much concern about concealing doctors' financial motivation to perform the surgery:   When the obstetrician performs the operation he ordinarily adds 10 to 15 percent to his bill, although some include it in their original fee.   [Should the baby be circumcised? Parents Magazine.]   We have a long history of doctors in the US looking at an infant's foreskin as if it were free money attached to the child's body. This is the primary financial reason, not the additional value of the tissue for resale to biotech companies.  It's important for intactivists to recognize that while there are financial reasons that reinforce the anti-foreskin bias prevalent among doctors in the US, the primary reasons for routine surgery are not financial. For instance, one of the biggest reasons the surgery is still popular is that apparently most circumcising doctors in the US do not know the difference between normal/developmental phimosis and the rare, pathological phimosis or other conditions that can make the surgery therapeutic. The demographics of doctors' ignorance about foreskin are interesting. While pediatricians would appear to tend to know more especially if they were educated more recently, the most uninformed group of doctors would appear to be the OB-GYNs who (not coincidentally) perform almost all non-therapeutic infant circumcisions.  Another interesting historical fact about promoting circumcision for the benefits of access to neonatal genital skin tissue, early 20th century anti-foreskin activist-extraordinaire, P. C. Remondino was also weirdly insistent on the benefit of routine infant circumcision as a source of skin graft stock for burn victims and other skin injuries. In many ways, Remondino was the model for contemporary anti-foreskin activists like Brian Morris and Edgar Schoen. I would assume that anti-foreskin activists like to focus on this possible reuse of healthy infant genital tissue because it misrepresents the tissue as merely skin for not reusing it as specialized erogenous skin and membrane but merely for its outer skin side. * typo"

It's worth pointing out that people become defensive unless the most neutral-sounding language possible is used to describe everything. That is why I try to avoid using the terms sad, awful or barbaric. Those are conclusions that people can reach on their own if they want. There are indisputable facts that are more persuasive. Surgery to destroy a part of a child's body with only the presumption that he will appreciate it is not ethical. Insignificant health benefits don't make it ethical."
Intactivists,2tj24f,IOnlyLurk,12,Sat Jan 24 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"Men attending 3 sexually transmissible disease clinics and a university health clinic in Sydney, Australia, were invited to complete a questionnaire on their use of condoms. Respondents were 108 male condom user volunteers aged 18 to 62 years; in the last five years 47 had had sex with men, 18 with both men and women and 43 only with women. They reported using a total of 4809 condoms in the previous 12 months (condoms worn by a male partner were not included). The overall breakage rate was 4.9% (including condoms breaking during application), while 3.1% of condoms reportedly slipped off. On a multivariate analysis, condom breakage correlated with: (1) male sexual partner(s), (2) infrequent condom use, (3) rolling the condom on as per conventional instructions (modified application methods appeared protective) and (4) having trouble with condoms partially slipping. Factors associated with condoms slipping off were (1) young age, (2) being circumcised, (3) having less life-time condom experience, (4) roiling the condom on conventionally, and (5) having trouble with condoms partially slipping.    Richters J, Gerofi J, Donovan B. Why do condoms break or slip off in use? An exploratory study. Int J STD AIDS. 1995 Jan-Feb;6(1):11-8.   I have cited this study before, but I hadn't thought to include it in my copy about condoms and circumcision yet. Copy like this is always a work in progress. If anyone was curious, here is that with this point added:   An ignored benefit of forgoing genital cutting is that condoms usually work better with the unmodified penis.   A number of studies have indicated that men with intact foreskin are less averse to using condoms.   In Australia, Bensley & Boyle (2001) surveyed college students whose partners had intact or circumcised penises finding: ""Circumcised partners more often resorted to unsafe sexual practices; they were significantly more likely to engage in anal intercourse (p < .05), and significantly more reluctant to use condoms (p < .05)."" Another Australian study found a circumcised penis correlated with reporting condoms slipping (Richters, 1995). A New Zealand woman has also mentioned those two points about her experience as a prostitute, which is legal there. In the non-fictional play she wrote, she stated that the only men she encountered who were interested in unprotected sex had circumcised penises (Johnson, 2012).   In Africa, Abbott (2013) found that the majority of female sex workers told them that men with circumcised penises had used their circumcision status to try to talk them out of using a condom. Popular reports from Africa have found the same (Botswana 2013, Malawi 2012, Uganda 2014, Zimbabwe 2013).   In the US, Crosby & Charnigo (2013) found a circumcised penis was better at predicting a man's recent history of unprotected sex than even his stated ""complete confidence"" in his ability to use a condom.   Men who had been circumcised were estimated to have almost three times the odds (estimated odds ratio [EOR] 2.96; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.66– 5.27, P = 0.001) to report UVS [unprotected vaginal sex] compared with intact but otherwise similar (i.e. comparably conﬁdent) counterparts. Men lacking complete conﬁdence in their ability to use condoms were estimated to have more than double the odds (EOR 2.28; 95% CI 1.21 –4.31, P = 0.01) to report UVS compared with completely conﬁdent but otherwise similar (i.e. same on circumcision) counterparts.   The ridged band of the foreskin is not only the most sensitive part of the penis, its shape helps to hold a condom on the penis better. The sensitivity and frictionless motion the foreskin provides should make condom use feel like less of a hassle, drawback or impediment to adequate feeling. Van Howe (1999) wrote:   American men are reluctant to use condoms. Studies indicate a considerably higher acceptance and usage rate for condoms in Europe and Japan, where circumcision is almost never practised. Some have suggested that American men are resisting a layer of latex that would further decrease sensation from a glans already desensitized from the keritinization following circumcision. Moreover, condoms are more likely to fall off the circumcised penis. This low acceptance of condoms may be responsible for the high rate of STD and teenage pregnancy rates in the United States—the only industrialized country that has failed to control bacterial STDs during the AIDS era."

Intactivists,2sfi10,shadowguyver,3,Thu Jan 15 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"Poorly proof-read, but I gave the following:   Your recommendation in support of the practice of preventative surgery on male infants is deeply saddening. As the public voice of health in the United States, you ought to be better informed ethically and medically and stand for ending this practice which has radical harm and only ill proven 'benefits.'  Your recommendations talk about several points:  lower risk of urinary tract infections in infancy  UTIs are easily treated with anti-biotics and prevented by proper hygiene in almost all cases. The idea that a sexually destructive surgery need be performed 'just in case' a boy is among the few percent that get a UTI is ridiculous. Such a position would be literally criminal to implement on girls and yet you recommend it for boys.  lower risk of balanitis and balanoposthitis.  Do we remove tonsils at birth in case they may later have an issue? Are toenails and fingernails pried off in case they may one day lead to infected ingrowth or harbor fungus? No, the idea of preventative surgery on an uninformed patient (on the extremely personal area of the genitals, no less), is foolish in the extreme. It is medically unnecessary, causes direct emotional and physical harm, creates unneeded risk and has absolutely no possible benefit in the vast majority of cases. Yet you recommend this expensive, cost-ineffective 'treatment' of diseases which likely do not even exist. Even if these issues arise, there is excellent evidence that they can be treated with far less drastic surgery than a complete excision of the foreskin and in many cases need only simple, inexpensive oral or topical medicine for a short period to eliminate infection.  lower risk of penile (and maybe prostate) cancer in adulthood  The plain fact is that chopping off any body part shortly after birth will prevent that body part from ever becoming cancerous. This is of course why we routinely surgically remove the external ear structures from all children, since skin cancer of the ear is vastly more common than cancer of the penis. This is also why we remove the breast buds of girls at birth- we would not want them to make the choice to keep their breasts if they may one day suffer the horrors of breast cancer. Of course the fact that breast cancer generally has a much earlier onset and higher rate of fatality informs this decision. It is no wonder that since a cancer as rare as penile cancer, and one that much less likely to cause death before a man's natural life-span is exceeded requires prophylactic surgery we recommend the routine excision of the breasts of all newborn girls.  future prevention of HIV and some STIs through heterosexual sex  Infants are not particularly at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, and have many years to be educated about safe sex practices before they become sexually active. Perhaps we should allow grown men to make decisions about genital modification and destroying a large quantity of mechanically lubricating, erotically enervated and generally protective skin rather than forcing it on defenseless infant boys. The claims of STI reduction are dubious and controversial- you should know this. Proper sexual education, condoms and basic hygiene could solve many of the problems with STIs. Genital cutting provides as best a very small absolute reduction in infection rates in men and does absolutely nothing to help the far more common transmission from men to their partners. Please stop wasting time and resources that could go into actually effective treatment and education on a benighted, ancient and discredited surgery.      I understand there are deeply held religious convictions among Jews and Muslims about this practice, but you have not addressed these points and speak as an authority in medicine. This stance is utterly indefensible and wrong-headed.  I am circumcised and deeply regret it. When I learned that the most sacred and emotionally restorative part of my life- my sexuality- was harmed in my infancy I was deeply hurt. To this day I have emotional anguish over the fact that I lack the sensitivity, mechanical lubrication and glans protection that would be afforded me if only I had not been strapped down and without anesthesia had my genitals cut apart. Circumcision as it is practiced today is ethically wrong, morally reprehensible and utterly without credible benefit. You should be ashamed for supporting this practice, acknowledge the cultural bias inherent in your statements and retract them promptly. You are wrong and you have every resource available to come to know you are wrong. You stand against a vast array of other, better informed medical agencies that actively discourage this practice, including those in Australia, the UK, all of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Canada and others. Come to your senses and help end non-therapeutic male genital disfigurement!"

Intactivists,2r7mae,jmg83,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"This post deserves a better answer too because there haven't been any and the original point is not a strong argument by itself.   This really isn't complicated. Vaccination is a social institution. It has that in common with nontherapeutic foreskin excision, but foreskin excision is so different from immunization, they shouldn't be compared.   The effort to liken foreskin excision to vaccination is very appealing to anti-foreskin activists because it presents foreskin excision as relatively harmless and beneficial. Immunization has absolutely nothing to do with foreskin excision except that anti-foreskin activists like Remondino (1902) and Brian Morris (2014) have been trying to confuse things to promote circumcision. People have been using confusion about the value of non-therapeutic genital modification to promote the surgery since the late 19th century.  Unlike circumcision, immunization does not destroy any part of the body. If vaccination were conceived of as a type of body modification in order to compare it to genital cutting, vaccines obviously attempt to add something useful to the body. Immunization is fundamentally an augmentation. Augmentation is exactly the opposite of destroying a part of the body. Circumcision is just a sophisticated name for foreskin excision, ablation or destruction. Circumcising cultures avoid more accurate terms defensively.  To quote a few of the responses to Brian Morris's promotion of routine genital surgery as a ""surgical vaccination"":   The procedure [non-therapeutic circumcision] is not to be equated with vaccination, either in its delivery or in its effectiveness.   —David Forbes, Chair, Paediatrics & Child Health Policy & Advocacy Committee, Royal Australasian College of Physicians  Professor Kevin Pringle, the Professor of Paediatrics and Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Otago in Wellington, said the comparison with vaccination was inappropriate as most of the diseases for which infants are vaccinated are potentially lethal or produce significant handicap.  Dr Russell Saunders: “Having reviewed Dr. Morris’s study, I find his statements about the benefits of circumcision as a routine procedure overblown, and the comparison with vaccination baseless.”"
Intactivists,2qjde4,johnw1988,10,Sat Dec 27 15:58:22 2014 UTC,I grew up Catholic and I too don't understand how Catholics or any Christians for that matter can circumcise. We are taught that body modifications are vain and unnecessary. We don't have a right to harm our bodies or others' unless there is medical need or as self defense.   Luckily my parents figured that out before I was born. My older brothers were not so lucky =\

Intactivists,2qjde4,gregbrahe,8,Sat Dec 27 17:10:47 2014 UTC,"It may not be a tenet of Christianity, but the high prevalence of circumcision in the US is very strongly related to Christianity, specifically Catholicism, which pushed very hard in the post WWII generations to promote circumcision specifically because it reduces sexual pleasure, as an effort to reduce masturbation among young men.  There is certainly a causal association in the United States."
Intactivists,2qjde4,JQuilty,10,Sat Dec 27 17:51:33 2014 UTC,"Catholics weren't the cause of it. You're thinking of Protestants, particularly the goofier, more out there ones like Seventh Day Adventists, which John Harvey Kellogg was. I can practically guarantee you John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis, the three popes in my lifetime, were not circumcised. I'd also bet that Patriarch Bartholomew, the head of the Orthodox Church, is not (though being born in Turkey puts some weight to the other side)."

Intactivists,2qjde4,qi1,5,Mon Dec 29 13:19:34 2014 UTC,"I think it's a misconception that Catholicism strongly promotes circumcision. Wikipedia gives a good overview of the topic from a Catholic perspective.   With the exception of the commemoration of the circumcision of Jesus in accordance with Jewish practice, circumcision has not been part of Roman Catholic practice.   Pope Emeritus (Father) Benedict XVI says:   The Church of Antioch sent Barnabas on a mission with Paul, which became known as the Apostle's first missionary journey... Together with Paul, he then went to the so-called Council of Jerusalem where after a profound examination of the question, the Apostles with the Elders decided to discontinue the practice of circumcision so that it was no longer a feature of the Christian identity (Acts 15:1-35). It was only in this way that, in the end, they officially made possible the Church of the Gentiles, a Church without circumcision; we are children of Abraham simply through faith in Christ.   And the Catechism could be interpreted as strongly disapproving circumcision:   CCC 2297: [...] Torture which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity. Except when performed for strictly therapeutic medical reasons, directly intended amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations performed on innocent persons are against the moral law."
Intactivists,2qjde4,gregbrahe,-2,Sat Dec 27 19:56:38 2014 UTC,"History tells otherwise. The proliferation of widespread circumcision in the West is very strongly associated with a cultural men's that masturbation (Onanism, to use the Biblically-based psychology term popular on the time) is self-abuse, leads to or is caused by insanity, and is extremely harmful. The Catholic church is at the epicenter of this meme."

We talk about the bible and occasionally stumble on a passage about circumcision. Our small group leader is pro-circ for some reason and said something about not wanting to clean an uncut penis. I was quiet until this point, but had to chime in and say, ""you don't have to retract the foreskin to clean it... Its fused to the glans until puberty"". Another couple who was apparently also holding their tongue backed me up and said they were flat out against it. The husband was from cuba so probably intact himself.   Generations of parents think they'll have to peel their kids foreskins back to clean behind it. The rampant misinformation is infuriating. And on the whole link between Christianity and circumcision. Jesus dieing on the cross nullified the covenant, which is where God originally asked man to circumcise their newborns as a show of faith. I think its just a habit."

Intactivists,2p1k2d,negdawin,5,Fri Dec 12 03:18:28 2014 UTC,"Hey man, first of all congratulations for making the decision to take the plunge into foreskin restoration! It's a great choice to regain some power and control over your body. If you can stick with it through to the end, you will not be disappointed.   Firstly, is it okay to use the manual tugging method WITHOUT an erection? Are there any advantages to stretching with an erection?   Yup, it is perfectly fine. Some tugging is done flaccid, and others erect. The main reason so many techniques have you starting erect, as this makes it easy to ensure you're applying a correct amount of tension. When you're erect, your penile tissues are already very close to the ""max"" in un-strained tension levels.    Secondly, I plan on doing an hour a day of manual tugging, and using a device or taping method when I have enough slack. Does this schedule sound good or should I bump it up to 2 hours?   This should be fine. I used a 1 hour daily schedule (broken into 15 min chunks) the first month before I got my tugger. The rule of thumb is more time is always better, and manual IS difficult to keep up with (can't be productive while your hands are on your wiener), but really you just do what you can. 1 hour gave me decent results, it might or might not for you. All depends on your skin and how it responds to the tension."
Intactivists,2p1k2d,aPseudonymPho,3,Fri Dec 12 03:46:00 2014 UTC,"Congrats on your decision. It is so worth it.  I had no slack skin when I began using T tapes.  You get a huge amount of stretching in the first few weeks.  Erections are irrelevant no matter what method, but you have to have one to put the t tape on. What shocked me most was how quickly my head was covered by the stretched skin, and keeping it on 24/7 allowed the head skin to revert to mucus membrane within a couple of weeks, so you will see benefits almost immediately if you do the 24/7 t tape method. Ask me any questions you may have."
Intactivists,2p1k2d,handsoffdick,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:48:22 2014 UTC,Thanks! I decided on the T-tape method. I am going to buy the materials and make a strap today. I'll see how it goes and if all is good I'll upgrade to wearing it 24-7. I'll message you if I have questions.
Intactivists,2p1k2d,handsoffdick,1 point,Tue Dec 16 01:44:03 2014 UTC,"So I'm about to buy the straps in a few hours, and I don't know if I should build a strap that goes over the right shoulder and under the left armpit, and then clipping the strap onto that, or if I should use a single strap and wrap it around my waist like a belt.  Do you know what I mean? Do you have a favourite strapping method? I will probably be moving around a bit at my new job next year, so I'm thinking the belt method will be more stable."
Intactivists,2p1k2d,handsoffdick,2,Tue Dec 16 05:02:53 2014 UTC,"I used a strap that wrapped around my waist that I attached to my underwear.  If you do this, alternate the side you tug from because you'll get uneven growth otherwise."

One tip, manual is really hard to keep up, especially for long periods of time, and you don't want to feel discouraged early on. While this takes a bit more effort, I'd suggest making your own temporary taping device.   Check out this site: http://www.foreskin.gc.bz/t_tape.php  It'll take about 10 minutes to put on the in morning and you'll need to keep tape with you to cut the lines and re-secure when you need to use the bathroom. Using this method, you can stretch for the bulk of the day and it doesn't require really any skin at all. Instead, you simply lengthen the strands of tape attached to the t-tape. I kept this going for about 2 months before I got my own device, had enough slack by the time it got here. I'd suggest using a band instead of weights, simply because weights tend to knock around while walking and I find more prone to fall off (clunk!).  I recently got a DTR and its a great device, so when your ready to step up to a long term device its a pretty good choice."
Intactivists,2p1k2d,Raider777,1 point,Fri Dec 12 09:01:51 2014 UTC,"+1,000,000 for the DTR.    If you have enough skin to use it (or when you get there), it's an amazingly well designed device. Comfortable enough to wear under clothes at work means getting eight or more hours a day in is easy. Results with it (since August for me) have been better than I could have hoped."
