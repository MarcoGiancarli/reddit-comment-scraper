LAClippers,3e4rv5,Chad3000,8,Tue Jul 21 23:16:56 2015 UTC,Big Baby has to be back on this team in some fashion. (SelvedgeLeopard's idea of him being team mascot is perfect if no room on the roster for him.) His defense and hustle were great down the stretch of the season and into the postseason (he was sizing up with Tim Duncan!!!!). I really like him as an extra body if Josh/Cole is sitting out for the night.

LAClippers,3e3t3j,seanarturo,2,Tue Jul 21 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think we should be using only current official logos for the team. While many of us (myself included) don't really love the new logo, it comes off as a bit amateurish if we add in fan logos into the mix. The flairs can have that sort of thing for the users who want them, but for an overall design, you'd be trying to mix a bunch of different design philosophies into one, and the result would be less than perfect.  That being said, /u/NightmareSyx, I do think this sub's design needs to be cleaned up a bit. Definitely appreciate all you've done , and all the add-ins like the links to the other nba subs and the games at the top are great additions. I just think there's a bit too much clutter and things could be organized a little more for a cleaner design that makes us on par with some of the other teams' subs - mostly it's the pinstriping everywhere that stands out in a bad way, but I did my usual thing and went overboard by making a (unfinished) mockup of a potential sub design: http://i.imgur.com/TdinD3q.png.  The black post is supposed to be a mod post. I thought the new addition of black into the Clippers' logo played off nicely for that as opposed to the weird green outline we have going now. This design is based off the Naut 2.0 design (/r/naut), so it shouldn't be too hard to put in place at all with a bit of code manipulation.  Just a thought."
LAClippers,3e3t3j,runningboardv3,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:58:51 2015 UTC,"despite my feelings about the new logo, i do think the sub should reflect it. i feel this sub at a glance is more about the clipper boats than the team. can we tone down the nautical stuff? not even the redesign is heavy on boats and anchors."
LAClippers,3e3t3j,SomeManWearingShoes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think the logos and stuff look great and they've done an awesome job. The team's new logos etc. aren't the best but whattayagonnado, let's support our team.  The one difference I'd propose is the cool layout on subreddits like the Kings'. The links/menus are in a different place and that little change really sets it apart. No idea how difficult that would be, though."

I know Lebron gets media attention but Cavs fans are passionate as hell for him.  If Lebron can leave Cleveland then I'm pretty sure PG can leave Indiana if he thinks he doesn't have a shot to win."

LAClippers,3dw7d4,ragnartheblue,4,Mon Jul 20 02:36:19 2015 UTC,You would think Lawson will come off the bench because he's a terrible fit with Harden. Hope we get some sweet Lance/Ty 6th man battles
LAClippers,3dw7d4,spoonymoonchair,6,Mon Jul 20 01:29:49 2015 UTC,I agree and disagree. I do think he should come off the bench because Beverley's defense is what they need against the star PGs of the west. But I think it could be good for Harden because it gives him more chances to work off the ball. The guy is a turnover machine. Lawson on the court means he won't have to handle the ball as much.
LAClippers,3dw7d4,a_c_31,5,Mon Jul 20 02:24:31 2015 UTC,My guess is he starts but gets subbed out quickly(we did this with Dmo this year) so Ty can run the offense with Harden out.

LAClippers,3droof,afrosheen,3,Sun Jul 19 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Lance's minutes go up probably. He plays more minutes at the 3, PP and Josh split minutes at the 4, where Smith could also spend some time on him, and Blake & DJ split time at the 5."
LAClippers,3droof,Eddy209Part2,3,Sat Jul 18 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think there's flexibility here. Lance, Wes and Smith would be primary defenders for KD. In spots CP and Blake. Another match up that is possible and could work is Pierce. Pierce would get burned off the dribble, but if he could put a body on KD, he could force him into tough shots. It's good to be able to look at the roster and know that there are options to defend one of the best players in the league."
LAClippers,3droof,es84,3,Sat Jul 18 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"Rotate Griffin, Stephenson and CP3 a bit later on in the game (maybe the 3rd quarter). Let CP3 take Westbrook out of his element the first two quarters and then switch it up."

LAClippers,3drefr,jbmartin82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"JJ Redick scored more points more efficiently on only 2 more mpg than Danny Green did last year.

LAClippers,3djsto,freeogy,3,Fri Jul 17 08:04:44 2015 UTC,I don't see how you tighten the screws on the shot selection of a player as old as he is. If he hasn't developed a decent basketball IQ at this point he never will.
LAClippers,3djsto,JakeofEarth,10,Thu Jul 16 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's bball IQ.  I think it's lack of bench weaponry last season resulting in forced offense.  He's a professional, I think he's capable of adjusting his style and running a few plays."

LAClippers,3djsto,Fresh_AM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:04 2015 UTC,"Wes seems young, impressionable, & to have potential. I really haven't followed his game at all though, so I'm not sure what to expect from him. I wonder how dawsen fiys in also. Who knows? Between the 2 of them, maybe we can find the exact type of defensive sf we need.  & for the pg, i think lil rivers is perfect at back up. Stephenson is expected to run the second unit offense until further notice, so if he becomes a spot up shooter and pesky defender & stephenson stays away from the ill adviced jumper (like crawford) then we should be all set."
LAClippers,3djsto,fake_red_wine,2,Thu Jul 16 22:49:50 2015 UTC,SQUAD
LAClippers,3djsto,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:03 2015 UTC,I want to see a CP3 - crawford - stephenson - smith - DJ lineup...  CP3 would blow his vocal cords out in about 20 seconds.
LAClippers,3djsto,escapingNihilism,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"yeah we need a real 3, especially when DJ isn't on the floor and they slide Pierce to 4 and Griffin to 5.  this is where losing Barnes hurts.  if you do something like play Stevenson and JJ together you have an awful defense.  it's still not a bad idea when trailing in games.  BTW Barnes will be a great fit in Memphis IMO.  they might have a PPG against of like 90."
LAClippers,3djsto,spoonymoonchair,10,Thu Jul 16 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Redick is solid defensively and Stephenson is very good from what I have heard. Pierce is the real defensive liability for us (which is why I hope Wes starts).
LAClippers,3djsto,JakeofEarth,4,Thu Jul 16 21:28:28 2015 UTC,How is Wes overall?  With 3 players slotted at the position (+Lance maybe) I'd say that hole is filled.  I want us to develop Dawson and give him minutes.  Not gonna happen if we get another SF.
LAClippers,3djsto,pulling_strings,5,Thu Jul 16 21:50:31 2015 UTC,He is long and athletic. Sometimes last year he turned those two assets into good defense and sometimes he didn't. I think part of the fact that he didn't always defend well was he played for the Los Angeles Lakers and with a team that bad it's hard to play with defensive intensity every possession.   Offensively he is a decent 3 point shooter and a decent slasher but not really much else.
LAClippers,3djsto,NinjaVaca,2,Thu Jul 16 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"pierce isn't a bad defender at all.  he's a smart defender and even though he won't pull in a ton of steals or blocks, his impact is felt.  his DRAPM was at a solid +2.5"
LAClippers,3djsto,SelvedgeLeopard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"I think we'll play Josh Smith with Blake while DJ is out, and then Smith with DJ while Blake is out. Like how Houston did against us in the playoffs with Jones, Smith, and Howard."

LAClippers,3djsto,PR05ECC0,3,Thu Jul 16 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"This has been his whole career, though. Last year might have been slightly influenced by the shallow bench but it's unlikely he'll be very different from the guy he's been for years."
LAClippers,3djsto,Fresh_AM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:00 2015 UTC,True.  I don't know I just don't want to give up on him yet.  He won us a few games last year and sometimes a spark is all you need to get the rest of the team going.
LAClippers,3djsto,SomeManWearingShoes,2,Thu Jul 16 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"Idk if he can become a reliable spot up shooter though. He's non-existent on the defensive end, and his entire career he's been an iso king & ball dominant. Him plus stephenson would not work unless crawford can operate without the ball."
LAClippers,3djsto,PR05ECC0,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, to be clear, I don't necessarily disagree. There's still value to that type of guy. Just saying, he's always been that sort of guy, and asking him to change the way he's been for years might be a lot to ask.  Also to be clear, I love the guy."
LAClippers,3djsto,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Fri Jul 17 00:05:43 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah totally, I feel that same way.  I do kind of hope they are able to hold on to him now with all the moves they have made.  I didn't think they were going to be able to get so much talent without moving him first.  Now that we have some good players, I say keep him. If it doesn't work out I think his value as a midseason spark would remain high if they wanted to move during the season."
LAClippers,3djsto,SomeManWearingShoes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:16 2015 UTC,"You mean, that time he way 6MoY the year before?  If you look at his stats... last year was a fluke of a down year, mainly because we asked him to do too much with too little.  IMO"
LAClippers,3djsto,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about playing style. He still played the exact same playstyle those other years. Yes, last year he made more of those shots (not to mention, he started a whole bunch of games, which definitely gives someone the sort of exposure bump that leads them to winning these subjective awards), but he was always the same sort of erratic, keep-shooting-til-you-get-hot type of player. Jamal's Jamal. We can hope for him to make a higher percentage of those fun wild shots, but asking him to alter his fundamental game after all these years is a lot."
LAClippers,3djsto,SomeManWearingShoes,2,Fri Jul 17 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"exactly.  I want jamal to be jamal.  But his shooting % will inevitably will go up when defenses are forced to key in on other guys.  Last year, everyone knew jamal was our only bench weapon so they only had to focus on stopping him.  that should change next year.  fingers crossed"
LAClippers,3djsto,juco818,2,Fri Jul 17 00:07:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm for it then. Especially now that we've got people we can plug in in case he's not hitting his shots, I've no problem with holding on to him."

LAClippers,3djsto,RedditIsTheDevil,15,Thu Jul 16 21:45:37 2015 UTC,Do you blame them? They offered 1.1 million more than we did (which is pretty much double) and he turned them down to sign with us. I'd be pissed if the situation was reversed
LAClippers,3djsto,lakeGriffin,11,Thu Jul 16 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"from my (limited) understanding... when Detroit cut him, they stretched his contract... meaning he gets paid 5.1M regardless of where he goes... LAC signed him for 1.5M and detroit has to pay the difference to make it 5.1M.  Rockets offering 2.5M only means that detroit has to pay less."
LAClippers,3djsto,RedditIsTheDevil,7,Thu Jul 16 22:39:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been doing more reading. One of these days I'm just gonna sit down with the CBA until I understand the whole thing
LAClippers,3djsto,Kpony,7,Thu Jul 16 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"dude... every new thing that comes up keeps making me ask ""why"", so I go back to the faq... then I start reading... i get like 1/4th of the way through the answer and go...  ""What the fuck does that mean Kobe Bryant?""  So i have to go and find the answer to that question...  it's some kinda fucked up recursive loop of learning."
LAClippers,3djsto,broadway_joe,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:30 2015 UTC,Just follow Larry Coon and Bobby Marks on twitter. CBA wizards.
LAClippers,3djsto,blake32griffin,9,Fri Jul 17 00:47:01 2015 UTC,I preferred Smoove to Jones. Seems like Doc went out and solved his biggest problem: depth.
LAClippers,3djsto,broadway_joe,2,Thu Jul 16 21:53:32 2015 UTC,whats wrong with jones though? everyone's high on him
LAClippers,3djsto,SelvedgeLeopard,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:52 2015 UTC,"He had some really unfortunate injuries, including one that almost threatened his career. His numbers this year were very limited, and Motiejunas (who you all luckily avoided) has, in my opinion, a way better game. He needs to return after an unfortunate season last year at a very important position in our offense"
LAClippers,3djsto,broadway_joe,2,Thu Jul 16 22:31:06 2015 UTC,which jones are we talking about?
LAClippers,3djsto,_boj,2,Thu Jul 16 22:55:58 2015 UTC,Terrance.
LAClippers,3djsto,d3dlyhabitz,8,Thu Jul 16 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"yeah we are, some guys assumed he would auto resign. I didn't, but it seems like felt like a better shot at a championship was with y'all so that hurts a bit."
LAClippers,3djsto,jamal_crawford,2,Thu Jul 16 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"Some people are, lots of us are glad he isnt coming back. I happen to like your young guys a lot more than Smith. He was really only ever insurance for Dmo going down, which we ended up needing big time."
LAClippers,3djsto,clayfu,2,Thu Jul 16 22:21:20 2015 UTC,"We have had Jamal, Baby, and a myriad of other players just like that. We embrace it. Hopefully cp3 tames him tho"

LAClippers,3djsto,benartmao,11,Thu Jul 16 21:12:37 2015 UTC,Total facelift. & I'm all for it.
LAClippers,3djsto,CmonTouchIt,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:32 2015 UTC,Wish we had someone else instead of rivers.... id take nate
LAClippers,3djsto,doinnothin,6,Thu Jul 16 21:58:41 2015 UTC,but homeboy really came through in the clutch for a few playoff games...thats gotta be worth somethin
LAClippers,3djsto,benartmao,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:06 2015 UTC,yeah I think he's gotta work on that consistency this year.  he's still super young and plays good defense.
LAClippers,3djsto,blake32griffin,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:00 2015 UTC,He has potential but i personally think its wasted because of his 1on1 ballislife mentality. Not a fan of him dribbling for so long and inability to pass efficiently.   Also ive always said he did have some good games in post season but.... you shit on me 100 times with crap performances and give me 1-2 decent ones im still gonna be annoyed about the times you shitted...  Hes young and he has potential so i hope he learns well.
LAClippers,3djsto,freeogy,3,Thu Jul 16 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"thats his problem, he's not a pass first guard but a shoot first. i'm fine with lance handling the ball and letting austin find his spots beyond the arc, or cutting through the lane"
LAClippers,3djsto,CmonTouchIt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:27:28 2015 UTC,Exactly. This is how we will run the bench offense most likely. Lance initiating and Rivers acting as a spot shooter.
LAClippers,3djsto,benartmao,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"yeah i mean hes totally not had 100 shitty games though, and had more than 1-2 good ones...important bit is he showed IMPROVEMENT, which given his age is excellent  also, pretty sure doc aint gonna tank the team for just one stinkin kid.  if the dude sucks, hes getting pulled"
LAClippers,3djsto,CmonTouchIt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"Ive been to every home game and jesus does the offense look lackluster when hes in. Hes similar to lebron in the sense that when he doesnt have the ball he just stands there doing nothing...  Ive seen players pass him up even though he was pretty open, im assuming because they dont have much confidence in him... I know he has potential but imagine if he was ever a LITTLE threat. It might help take defenders off blake/DJ/CP3/Red.   Again i know he has potential but if he cant change his mindset... that potential means nothing. He plays like a kobe with the abilities of a perkins"
LAClippers,3djsto,benartmao,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"i mean i was at quite a few home games myself, and yeah, he sucked during the regular season.  averages all went up in the postseason tho, even when minutes went down.  anyone that can step it up in the playoffs, i figure we give a shot  besides, who else we gonna get?  Ty maybe?  we welllll over the cap lol"
LAClippers,3djsto,CmonTouchIt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:57 2015 UTC,Im just not a rivers fan... Im hoping to win the west this year so i set my standards really high ahahha. Maybe Cliff Paul?

DO YOU HATE THE CLIPPERS OR SOMETHING"
LAClippers,3djsto,freeogy,3,Thu Jul 16 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but we may have enough space to pickup Nate still, or at least another PG from Summer league or something"

LAClippers,3djsto,DjentDavinDjent,11,Thu Jul 16 21:32:39 2015 UTC,It's such a good pick up because we played hedo turkoglu for over 30 minutes once last season.

LAClippers,3djsto,pulling_strings,2,Fri Jul 17 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"He did. Rained threes and everything. But a lot of our problem in the playoffs was that our starting unit, particularly the bigs, had to play 45 minutes every night.

LAClippers,3djsto,Vbpretend,5,Thu Jul 16 21:36:34 2015 UTC,"he can stretch the floor and is a really good passer. if he's beyond the arc, he can simply lob it up to DJ"

LAClippers,3djsto,SomeManWearingShoes,3,Thu Jul 16 21:35:53 2015 UTC,"When DJ was leaving and we signed Wes Johnson, I lost hope. I figured Doc tossed in the towel. Thank God DJ picked up that phone and let Doc know he wanted to come back. We have a solid defense off the bench with Rivers, Lance, Wes and Smith. We're not talking about a team of Tony Allen's, but you could mess around with this line up and stay in games defensively. Definitely will struggle offensively, but that can always be fixed by putting in Pierce.  Now if Doc can package Jamal and Wilcox for another big man or another capable scorer"
LAClippers,3djsto,spoonymoonchair,3,Thu Jul 16 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Man in Jamal stays, that second unit is going to be a mother fucking roller coaster ride every night lol. Rivers, Crawford, Stephenson, Smith, and Aldrich. Damn hahah, either insanely good or turnover and bad shot selection galore"

I love the dude, I've followed him on almost every team he's been on, but he's a shot chucker who's temperature is ultra fickle.

LAClippers,3djsto,Kpony,3,Thu Jul 16 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"I always feel like Jamal makes the shot more difficult than it needs to be, even if he makes a good amount of them. Even when hes open its like hes rushing, but hey I've never averaged 20 points a game in the nba so what do I know"
LAClippers,3djsto,michaellapointe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people are saying that Jamal's erratic play was because he was the only bench player last year, but that doesn't account for every other season of his career. He is who he is.  However, now that we've filled things out a bit I wouldn't say it'd be the worst to keep him. Now if he's cold we actually have other players to swap him out for. He was a solid piece for the regular season but abysmal during the playoffs. Maybe he plays similar to last year then Pierce takes his playoff minutes?"

LAClippers,3djsto,Shoobedowop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:52 2015 UTC,Only 13 roster spots filled. Only 4 of them are legitimate big men. The Clippers still need another big man. Im guessing it will be Glen Davis.
LAClippers,3djsto,CrissXAppleSauss,2,Thu Jul 16 22:53:20 2015 UTC,or javale if he signs the min
LAClippers,3djsto,palebluedap,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:12 2015 UTC,Javale would only be good if we spent time to develop him.  Being behind DJ and Cole... he'd just be another Ryan Hollins (sorry /u/robotkitten)... not worth it.  I'd rather have big baby.

LAClippers,3dle97,the_HeyThere_member,13,Fri Jul 17 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure why it would be for lolz.   Javale is a very good 7-foot Center who can get up there. Just because he is on Shaqtin a lot doesn't mean he is a bad player. It just means he makes stupid plays every now and then. And if you pay attention to the Shaqtin commentary, they always comment about how well he is playing besides the featured clip.   If you watch that video that was on here yesterday, where he is working with Amare and Hakeem on his post moves, the guy has soft hands and good post moves too. Better post moves than DJ for sure.   He would be a great addition, and if he had free throw shooting down, probably would have been a better match for backup C than Aldrich."
LAClippers,3dle97,SelvedgeLeopard,6,Fri Jul 17 05:48:14 2015 UTC,you are absolutely right.  He would be a great addition and make us deeeep

Deadshot: Lance Stephenson  Harley Quinn : Austin Rivers  Joker: Jamal Crawford  Deathstroke: Paul Pierce   King shark: Josh Smith   Amanda Waller: Doc Rivers   Edit: I changed Pierce from Manta To Deathstroke I'm going with the cinema universe instead of Comic one.

A big part of being a successful NBA player is having control of the mental aspect of the game, and not letting nerves get to you.

LAClippers,3dk8hu,REDUCE5231,37,Thu Jul 16 23:04:34 2015 UTC,keep him and watch him flourish with a bench that's not garbage.

LAClippers,3dk8hu,Dalenskid,2,Fri Jul 17 09:09:13 2015 UTC,"Fuckin' keep him if we can afford it. We got some awesome additions, why not hold on to a 2 time 6th man of the year?

LAClippers,3dk8hu,spoonymoonchair,4,Fri Jul 17 19:16:34 2015 UTC,Get rid of him and hopefully get something decent in return.

LAClippers,3dk8hu,noavgho,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:56 2015 UTC,the time to trade him is long passed.. right after he won 6moy with us. after his crappy year i doubt we'd get anything decent in return so now we might as well keep him and let him do some cool passes since we don't have an official backup pg.  the thing that pisses me off the most about him is when he guards the inbounder.. puts in minimal effort allowing any pass from outofbounds. got to take lessons from varejao
LAClippers,3dk8hu,bwhite9,3,Sun Jul 19 08:55:00 2015 UTC,Trade for jarrett jack.

LAClippers,3din69,spoonymoonchair,-7,Thu Jul 16 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but none of these are as good as the current logo. The winning pick looks like a D-league affiliate or a logo from the late 90s, early 2000s. Think Chauncy-era pistons, KG-Timberwolves. Graphic design isn't moving in those complicated, difficult to embroider & screen print direction. Sure, the presentation was the best, and the layout was clean and gave us a really good idea what it would look like, but the overwhelming boat and nautical theme is a big turn off.  This one is interesting, I think the skyline could use three or four different versions, preferably one where the ball and skyline are centralized rather than at an angle. I liked this one the most, even though it's essentially the same take as the old San Diego logo. I would darken the baby blue up to our current royal. I've always liked it because it has simple graphic elements without being overwhelmingly nautical (boats, anchors, dolphins, pirates with wooden legs and eye patches). It's simple and it would look good on hats."
LAClippers,3din69,gronquil,4,Thu Jul 16 19:47:31 2015 UTC,So everything has to be 'modern' and not fun nowadays?
LAClippers,3din69,iAMtHESushighost,3,Thu Jul 16 22:32:24 2015 UTC,No but it has to be at least well designed even if it is a boring concept. The curves on the logo aren't done well and there is a number of poorly designed aspects to it.

LAClippers,3dk45g,hazzajames,10,Fri Jul 17 06:36:32 2015 UTC,Realistically none of them will win 6moy. It's too hard to put up the stats to be 6moy unless you are basically carrying the bench on your back. That shouldn't happen with this bench as it's pretty deep.  I think Lance will probably be the best player off the bench as he will be able to maximize his skill-set against lesser defenders and with better teammates. His all around game should be able to do a lot of things our bench and team just didn't have last year.
LAClippers,3dk45g,a_c_31,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:16 2015 UTC,"I really think Lance makes a hard push for it. Doc is the type of coach he needs, and CP, Blake, Pierce are the kind of teammates I think he needs to help guide him and help him get his career back on track. His play-making abilities are incredible when he's not trying to do too much. That's what got him in trouble at times in Indiana and A LOT in Charlotte, which was not a good fit for him last year."

After the game, Blake and Chris took like a picture or two, DJ and Big Baby left ASAP, and Matt Barnes stood there for at least 30 mins taking pictures and signing shit.

LAClippers,3dg8a8,sgp1986,4,Thu Jul 16 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"She worked for a Late night show and last year a few of the Clippers were on it. She got to meet all of them and take pictures. She said they were all super nice. Then after they finished filming Matt went up and found her at her desk and asked her to go get a drink. She was taken by surprise and said, ""Oh I can't right now I have to work"" and left her desk for a moment. When she came back he had written on a post-it: It was really nice to meet you, let's get a drink sometime. I can't remember if he put his number down but I'm sure she has the damn thing framed at her desk. She's a big Clipper fan too.  It was before I had proposed to her so I can't really blame the guy for trying (no ring). Hell, he's got great taste in women. I also learned that was when he was going through hard times with his wife, and he was playing really shitty. Then a few months later he patched things up with her and started playing great.   I know he was the weakest of our starting lineup last year but damn can the guy finish in transition. It's always fun having an attitude like that on your team. It's not going to be fun having that attitude on one of my least favorite teams. But I will still salute him and then promptly yell ""Fuck the Grizz""."
LAClippers,3dg8a8,raucon,8,Thu Jul 16 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Barnes is one of those players everyone loves to have on their team. He's a little out of control sometimes, but its that streak of idgaf that every team needs to compete."

LAClippers,3def1t,RedditIsTheDevil,6,Wed Jul 15 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"This sounds kind of terrible, why are we signing a rookie to such a short deal? Couldn't we have made it 3-4 years with only the first year guaranteed anyways?"
LAClippers,3def1t,TheIceMachine,2,Wed Jul 15 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know the CBA that well, but I think you can have only a max of 1 non-guaranteed year.  At least I don't think i've ever seen more than one."
LAClippers,3def1t,RedditIsTheDevil,6,Wed Jul 15 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Oh you're probably right. Still though since the cap is rising, if we decide to keep Dawson in 2 years he will be getting paid far more than if we struck a 3-4 year deal with him now."
LAClippers,3def1t,TheIceMachine,10,Wed Jul 15 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah.  But realistically, he was the 56th pick for a reason.  Sure, he had a great summer league showing... but that was the Summer League.  We need to see how that translates to NBA play.  Also, he's a god awful freethrow shooter.  Then there's the thing where Doc Rivers refuses to play rookies more than like 2 minutes for the whole season.  I think we all see the potential... but a 3/4 year deal would be too long IMO."
LAClippers,3def1t,RedditIsTheDevil,3,Wed Jul 15 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see that. To me 2 years is just too short to expect a rookie to be at his top NBA level, I think you need to give them time to grow and learn. We know he won't get much play time his first year so realistically he's only getting one year to prove he's worth it. Not sure I agree with that but that's  probably why I'm not a GM."
LAClippers,3def1t,Accounting4lyfe,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"dammit, now you got me thinking why we didn't do a 2+1 for a 3 year deal we can bail out of after 2 years...  According to CBA rules :   Also unlike first round picks, teams do not receive a salary cap exception specifically for their second round picks. These players must be signed using cap room or an available exception (see question number 25), such as the Minimum Salary exception or the Mid-Level exception.   and    It is most common for a second round pick to receive the minimum salary and be signed using the Minimum Salary exception. However, since the Minimum Salary exception limits contracts to two seasons, it is not uncommon for teams to use a portion of their Mid-Level exception in order to sign the player for three seasons. This gives the team full Bird rights at the end of the contract, and avoids the Gilbert Arenas provision   And i'm pretty sure don't have any of the MLE left after signing Paul Pierce..  So basically, we could only offer a 2 year min deal. :-("

LAClippers,3def1t,blake32griffin,14,Wed Jul 15 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"we have paul pierce, and a bevy of guys that can cover the three... like Wes, Dawson, Lance and Jordan Hamilton...

LAClippers,3def1t,RedditIsTheDevil,6,Wed Jul 15 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"Lance is more of a PG/SG offensively but SF defensively. Most teams have in the league now have perrenial SF and despite being able to rotate with those SF interchangeably, we still need an established starting SF. Dawson and Hamilton will probably play scrub minutes and it really dwindles down to Wes/Pierce which I don't think is enough. Sorry to disagree"
LAClippers,3def1t,blake32griffin,6,Wed Jul 15 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Oh no.. i get it... I agree with you.  The problem is the value that you're going to be able to get in return for Jamal.  He's 35, coming off a down year and gets paid 5 or so mil.  We're not going to be able to flip that for someone who can play valuable minutes at the 3.

When Nash wanted money he let him walk.

LAClippers,3del05,kyizo,11,Wed Jul 15 17:41:35 2015 UTC,ballmer does
LAClippers,3del05,blake32griffin,6,Wed Jul 15 17:46:55 2015 UTC,Short answer is that vet min/rookie contracts don't count against the cap.
LAClippers,3del05,lakeGriffin,4,Wed Jul 15 17:54:02 2015 UTC,Loooooooooong answer  There's a table in there that kinda summarizes it a bit too.  (just so happened to have the CBA faq open for another thread :)
LAClippers,3del05,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Wed Jul 15 18:00:58 2015 UTC,actually I think 2 round picks do count against the cap.  im not sure if a minimum rookie 2nd round contract does though
LAClippers,3del05,pulling_strings,2,Wed Jul 15 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"After reading the cba link redditsatan posted, you appear to be correct. I'm (clearly) not an expert but I would assume since it's a min contract were allowed to go over it, because otherwise we have no money"
LAClippers,3del05,lakeGriffin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"it still counts against the cap... we're just allowed to exceed the cap with the signing using the ""minimum player contract"" exception."
LAClippers,3del05,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Wed Jul 15 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"You knew what I meant. It's less that they don't count against the cap, more that the cap doesn't apply to those type of contracts."
LAClippers,3del05,lakeGriffin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"only reason I make the distinction, is because it comes into play when we start talking luxury tax (84M, clipper current salary = ~92M), and the repeat offender increases that come into play.  I know ballmer is rich, but he's gotta be careful to get back under the luxury limit, else he's gonna be basically giving money away to the rest of the league hand-over-fist.  Which means, it's going to be interesting to see what moves we make next year... do we hit the cap, but stay under the luxury (miss out on KD)? Or do we go balls out and say fuck the repeat offender rate spikes."
LAClippers,3del05,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Wed Jul 15 23:17:56 2015 UTC,right on thanks
LAClippers,3del05,pulling_strings,5,Wed Jul 15 23:15:33 2015 UTC,"when you resign a player you are allowed to go over cap if they have 3 bird years, you can also sign any player without a cap space if they sign for the veterans minimum"
LAClippers,3del05,pinkluloyd,5,Wed Jul 15 17:47:11 2015 UTC,U can go over the cap in a variety of situations not just the full bird.

LAClippers,3da2yk,ChampKind-Sports,12,Tue Jul 14 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"The Taj Gibson trade is one that's been thrown around a bit. I think it works theoretically, the Bulls need a guard that brings scoring off the bench not named Kirk Hinrich and the Clips need a legit 3rd big, and nobody's more legit than Taj, plus he's a L.A. native who's been on the trading block for a while. Taj could play with either DJ and Blake and make up for both of their differences, way better defender than Blake, and better offensive player than DJ. Jamal, plus any of those other guys wouldn't hurt us at all and we might be set with our 10 rotation players. Right now it's just the Bulls willingness to trade Taj."
LAClippers,3da2yk,Eddy209Part2,6,Tue Jul 14 18:57:44 2015 UTC,Right now it's just the Bulls willingness to trade Taj   And we're in a post Thibs world. So that willingness has increased.

LAClippers,3da2yk,Eddy209Part2,5,Tue Jul 14 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"So many possible line-ups with this guy! Plus he loves a poster dunk, would fit right in here."
LAClippers,3da2yk,mgoblue32,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"There's no chance the bulls trade Taj for Crawford. Taj is half the price of Jamal, 5 years younger, and was the bulls defender by far last year. They already have aaron brooks as their guard coming off the bench.  The last thing they want is a combo of aaron brooks and jamal crawford in the same lineup."
LAClippers,3da2yk,dillydelly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:11:55 2015 UTC,Not that it's that important but he's not an la native. He did play at usc but I believe he was from Brooklyn

LAClippers,3da2yk,lakeGriffin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:21:18 2015 UTC,Id hit that... I LOVE Jcross but we have enough offense already..  We really need to strengthen the front court backup bigs and both Taj and Marqueef would be perfect..
LAClippers,3da2yk,Eddy209Part2,0,Wed Jul 15 10:41:27 2015 UTC,"My guess is very little. Markieff is known for a bad attitude and mediocre play, not to mention that ongoing criminal investigation. I don't know what the Taj situation is like, but I don't really see a place for him on our team. Most of us, including myself, are hoping Jamal turns into a wing defender. I don't think that defender needs to be a starter, but we could start Pierce and then just run a rotating cycle of wings out there so they're always fresh to play defense."
LAClippers,3da2yk,2_uber,6,Tue Jul 14 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"I think that Taj totally has a place on our team. We've been clamoring for the need of a 3rd big that can be relied on in the playoffs for years and Taj is that guy. He can bring both scoring and defense off the bench at the 4/5 position and play 24+ minutes a night. Cole Aldrich doesn't bring enough on either side of the ball, and Big Baby, as much as we love him, is a glorified towel waver at this point. That still leaves a hole in the PF/C position. We're pretty set at the wings with PP, Wes, and even Lance being able to lock down players at the 3."

Edit: I should note that being stabbed doesn't mean that Copeland won't be able to play in the NBA again. Paul Pierce was stabbed eleven times in the head and neck in either his rookie or second year and has had a great career.

He is also a good energy guy. I think we would prefer someone who has the ability to defend the 4, preferably defend both the 4 and the 5.

LAClippers,3d5yzr,jeepinjosh,7,Mon Jul 13 20:19:52 2015 UTC,sign another PF and then anything after that is a bonus.

With PP and Lance we can break down/Isolate/Dominate multiple positions depending on matchup."
LAClippers,3d5yzr,ottoman153,4,Tue Jul 14 04:36:31 2015 UTC,Yes Jamal will be dangerous with a better second unit. And not only Jamal. Jamal-Lance-PP-Baby-Aldrich :)  Maby an extra PF or a SF. But i like Dawson. And would be fun to watch a rookie develop by getting minutes.

He said he thought people with mental illness were treated unfairly in the NBA--possibly true--but them he also kind of acted like a spoiled kid.

LAClippers,3d4mlx,magicwhistle,3,Mon Jul 13 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"Dunno why some are downvoting you, but Josh Smith on fire is DEEPLY annoying to play against (as seen in the game you mention), which is why I want him. If he's off, bench him. If he's on, let him loose!"
LAClippers,3d4mlx,noavgho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"he definitely will make a difference.  we are really shorthanded on defensive players and he's an above average defender at a PF.  teams will always drive to the rim as soon as DJ is on the bench replaced by bigbaby.  as long as we keep pounding it into JSmooves head that he shouldn't take those 3s, and limit his offensive role in general, he can be quite valuable for us."
LAClippers,3d4mlx,idontpopmolly10,5,Tue Jul 14 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"I know kings are interested in him and can offer him around $7 mil, but Sacramento is such a train wreck he might not wanna go there, Rockets can keep him for about $2.5 mil, Mavs are interested and could sign him to a fairly big contract, the clips could use the rest of the MLE and get him for about $2.1 mil. He does still receive $5.4 mil a year through 2019 from the pistons due to the stretch provision. Kings can offer him the most playing time but the worst situation. Mavs can offer him a lot of money and a decent role but he will still be Dirk's back up and no real title chance. Clips and Rockets can offer him around the same amount of money and similar roles. Kind of depends on what he wants but if he really does want to win a title and contribute coming to the Clips as a 3rd big and being another playmaker on the second team and contributing in some small ball lineups is nice role"
LAClippers,3d4mlx,noavgho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:56:20 2015 UTC,"the kings are seriously on a roll making some solid signings, i'd say one of the better offseasons in the league for them.  hope they don't sign smith.  i'm more worried he would go back to the rockets. his friendship with dwight seems to be a big factor on where he wants to go"

LAClippers,3d4mlx,SelvedgeLeopard,2,Mon Jul 13 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"too bad we didn't trade him after 6moy, and before his calf injury"
LAClippers,3d4mlx,michaellapointe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah... But then it's tough to trade him at that moment, when he seems so key to our bench production. Retrospect is always 20/20."
LAClippers,3d4mlx,SelvedgeLeopard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:33:04 2015 UTC,"True, Hindsight is always 20/20, but there were a lot of people who wanted to move him back then, including Doc. We still had the hole at the 3 back then (perhaps even more so given that Barnes didn't play as well that year than this past season, IIRC), and Jamal was already on the trading block. I remember he was relieved when Doc decided not to move him."
LAClippers,3d4mlx,noavgho,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"the start of the season right after he won the 6MOY was the best time to trade him.  thats like one of the few BSimmons trades i agreed with. right after that, jamal's stats all fell down a bit."

Smith also plays pretty well with Dwight. If Smith came over to LA, I would be surprised, but not that surprised."

LAClippers,3d14tt,WalterBlanco08,10,Sun Jul 12 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"I'm happy to have him back and would've been happy for him to make more than the min but isnt 3.2mill a bit much?   Either its paying for potential or he is Doc's son, would it not make some vets frustrated who plays a bigger role but getting paid less for the min, thinking about Austin and his relationship with the coach?  I just hope it doesnt cause any tension with potential FAs coming in or vets in the team."
LAClippers,3d14tt,pinkshirtday,20,Sun Jul 12 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make a difference. We can't spend that 3.2 mil this year on any other players. We can still only offer minimums to everyone else, regardless if we gave Austin the minimum or 3.2 mil. The only one hurt by this deal is Balmer's bank account which from what I've heard won't be hurt all too much. Next year with the expected cap rise I believe this contract will be worth something like 3.5 percent of the cap.  I'd just like to point out that Al Farouq Aminu just got a 30 mil over 4 year deal, which many people thought was a decent price for him.   Al Farouq Aminu(24 years old)shot 41.2% from the field  and 27.4 % from the 3pt line during the regular season. He averaged in 18.5 minutes a game 5.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, .8 assists, .8 blocks, and .8 steals.  Austin Rivers (22 years old) shot 42.7 % from the field and 30.9% percent from the three point line in the regular season for LAC. In 19.3 minutes Austin averaged 7.1 points, 2.0 rebounds, 1.7 assists, .2 and .7 steals.  Both these players were lottery picks and both had their 4th year declined by NOP and ended up putting very similar statlines this season. They both had great playoff runs. But AFA is being praised as a high potential talent, while Austin is pretty much being bashed as bust.  However, Austin has been in the league for 2 less years and is 2 years younger. So overall I would say this is a solid deal when put into perspective for the going price of young players who play well in the playoffs.  TL;DR: It is a pretty decent deal for a 22 year old point guard, who just had a very good playoff run."
LAClippers,3d14tt,pinkshirtday,5,Sun Jul 12 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree that 3m a year isnt bad for a young back up pg. I just hope he can back up that role with production.   I heard that this contract is the most the Clips can offer and I just hope his production can back up the choice the front office offered so that other players doesnt think its because his Doc's son and cause any tension.  Like for example, take 500k or 400k off the 2 years, so 2.7 or 2.8m a year and people would think Doc wants Austin to prove he can earn 3m+ and not just give it to him. And other players or fans wouldnt talk about this whole Doc relationship.      I'm not worried that the prices impact on the team, but the impact on how other players think of the treatment and perception off Austin by the Clippers office.   Edit: It's just cause its complicated as he is Doc's son. If he doesnt play well this season, its looks a lot worst than the Dudley trade or Hawes signing because the media and fans will mix in favoritism in and other players may feel the same.   btw, I like Austin, hope he plays well."
LAClippers,3d14tt,ragnartheblue,7,Sun Jul 12 19:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yah realistically people are gonna slight this signing because he is the coaches son but this is what he probably should of been paid. One could argue that he should've paid less because he will have the best opportunity to improve himself on the Clippers behind CP3 and his dads coaching but I think he would still be a decent role player given playing time on any team. I think that the Clippers biggest mistake here isn't tacking a third year team option which they definitely could've and should've gotten.  Could it turn away free agents? I guess, but if that was the case I'd assume they'd already be turned off that we traded for the coaches son last year.  I think regardless of what we signed Austin for, people would mock the front office for it. This is the max we could give him because we signed him using the bird exception which in this case can be used to pay the amount of money if his 4th year of his rookie contract(3.1 mil) wasn't declined. It won't be as bad as Dudley or Hawes because it's first off a smaller contract and shorter contract and dudley and Hawes represent us misusing our assets(got hawes instead of pierce; traded bledsoe for dudley)."
LAClippers,3d14tt,RaoulDuke504,4,Sun Jul 12 20:38:29 2015 UTC,With the cap unexpectedly going up to $70mil next season I thought we would be able to give above minimum to one person. Did the addition of another ~2 million of cap space not change anything?
LAClippers,3d14tt,CurrentlyCompiling,6,Sun Jul 12 19:49:01 2015 UTC,Yah Im fairly sure we were over the cap in both situations so it didn't make a difference. Even if we were hypothetically under the cap it wouldn't make a difference as we would sign Austin once the contracts went over the cap. Here's the most updated version of the Clippers salaries I could find.   http://www.spotrac.com/nba/los-angeles-clippers/cap/

LAClippers,3d14tt,RaoulDuke504,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:06:57 2015 UTC,It's because Austin being a bust is a circle jerk now with some Shaqting a fool reels + being Doc's son. That's fine with us though and it works out well for us
LAClippers,3d14tt,lakeGriffin,8,Tue Jul 14 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"Paying for potential but since this is only a two year deal I'm fine with that. The Pelicans coaching staff since Rivers got into the league has done a terrible job developing young players, aside from Anthony Davis who would be great regardless, and Rivers showed some real growth last year. If nothing else he's a solid defensive option off the bench and as a spark plug.  Of course this all goes way over the heads of r/nba but so do most things that aren't written with emojiis."
LAClippers,3d14tt,magicwhistle,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:29:47 2015 UTC,Is this a joke let me give you a list  Robin Lopez  Tyreke Evans  Jarret Jack  Ryan Anderson  Marco   Anthony Morrow  Alexis Ajinca  Quincy Pondexter  Vasquez   All greatly improved since they came here. Austin is the only player who did not get better and show no real improvementa to his game despite multiple chances. Rivers did not play better with the Clippers he just played at a faster pace Wichi allowed him to avg 1-2 more points .

LAClippers,3d14tt,magicwhistle,2,Mon Jul 13 00:33:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People are so quick to put this guy down; But, if you watch him every game he tends to do more good than bad. Good backup point guard who can learn even more from CP3."
LAClippers,3d14tt,untouchedURL,2,Sun Jul 12 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"You say ""watch him game after game"" but you are just linking to arguably his best performance in his entire NBA career in Game 3 of the Rockets series.   Austin came in clutch for us in that game. Big time. But it was a huge surprise to many people. I was at that game, and I can guarantee you that the sentiment leading in to it was that we would be lucky to steal one since that was the first game CP was back after his hamstring injury. No one was expecting Austin to take over. We all had fun when he did with chants of ""Austin Rivers"", but it was definitely not something we were counting on.   I hope he continues to play like that, but he has been far from consistent at that level of play."
LAClippers,3d14tt,slyhooper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:07:17 2015 UTC,"He's not reliably amazing, but he's also not reliably a steaming pile of horse manure like people make him out to be.

I think Brandon Bass, Jeremy Lin and Mo Williams are all getting paid less than Austin. Is $3.2M really reflective of Austin's price on the free agent market? I haven't heard a single rumor about any team floating Austin an offer.  Beyond that we don't even have any flexibility with this contract because the second year is a player option. If he gets better, he leaves and gets paid. If he doesn't, he stays and eats up $3.2M of cap space. SMH."
LAClippers,3d14tt,lakeGriffin,3,Sun Jul 12 22:03:13 2015 UTC,it doesnt mater if austin was getting the least amount or most amount the clippers could give him. due to his past contract and salary cap rules non of the money spent on austin counted towards the cap. so no you couldnt have given someone else the 3.2m you can only hand out minumum contracts which austins counts as

LAClippers,3d0x5p,rugtap,3,Mon Jul 13 04:28:32 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuck that. Best I can do is some blue clipper mirror dice I got from a giveaway when I went to a clipper game in the 90s.  Or some old hats.  My favorite was a stretchy red fitted hat that I had back when limp bizkit was popular.  I'd flip that shit around and I looked like Fred Durst.  I am not exactly proud of that part of my past.  I ain't buying any shit with the new logo.

LAClippers,3d0fl2,Lemanski22,11,Sun Jul 12 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a Knicks fan so I watched him for the last two years.  He's a great third string center. Mediocre second string guy. Pretty solid defender, good rebounder, has a surprisingly nice touch around the rim (he won't dunk on anyone but he'll put up some nice running hooks in the paint).  Pretty much just solid. Not great laterally, he used to be a Brandon wright type but he bulked up for last season and lost some of that mobility in order to improve his low post defense.  He's still technically young but this is a good solid signing. Glad he can go to a contender and my second team, I'm a fan of the OG Cole train"
LAClippers,3d0fl2,cyph3x,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:43:09 2015 UTC,Hes better than 3rd string.  How much more do you want from a backup other than good defense very good rebounding (check the rates) and good touch around the rim?
LAClippers,3d0fl2,pulling_strings,8,Wed Jul 15 07:53:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, their game is just not that colorful."
LAClippers,3d0fl2,x_o_x_o,7,Sun Jul 12 14:26:13 2015 UTC,He looks good and thankfully isn't a shooter. He hustles for offensive boards even if he isn't the most athletic. He's also like an 80% free throw shooter at center which is nice
LAClippers,3d0fl2,clipperw2014,5,Sun Jul 12 14:48:39 2015 UTC,It hasn't been officially confirmed yet right?
LAClippers,3d0fl2,TheFishThatDrowned,2,Sun Jul 12 15:28:33 2015 UTC,That's true.
LAClippers,3d0fl2,ragnartheblue,6,Sun Jul 12 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"He's young, good defensive big, which is mostly what we need him for. Personally I perfer young guys like him over veterans like Amare or Javale because the young ones have something to prove, that mentality helps. He can also shoot FT, so if DJ doesn't improve, we can sub Cole back in."
LAClippers,3d0fl2,Mista123,2,Sun Jul 12 15:29:52 2015 UTC,Amare to the Heat :/
LAClippers,3d0fl2,LongElm,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"Towards the end of the season I watched a fee Knicks games, and I really liked what Cole had to offer. He's a solid back up."
LAClippers,3d0fl2,lockdown36,2,Sun Jul 12 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"Aldrich is good.  he has size, wont turn it over too much, and rebounds well.  very good backup."
LAClippers,3d0fl2,pulling_strings,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"He's a decent shot blocker, he rebounds well, he can score inside, and he makes free throws. He might not be a great defensive player (neither is Amare though) but he does everything else well. He's also infinitely less likely to go full retard than JaVale McGee which is a plus. I think he'll lock down the backup Center role whenever DeAndre Jordan is off the court and do well in that spot."
LAClippers,3d0fl2,PomfAndCircvmstance,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:22:39 2015 UTC,not sure if he'll fit our offense
LAClippers,3d0fl2,blake32griffin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:20:11 2015 UTC,is he actually signed? i didn't see any alerts.
LAClippers,3d0fl2,Shoobedowop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:18 2015 UTC,I like Cole Aldrich. He's got the kind of hustle that Glen Davis has but is obviously taller and younger. There were many times this past year where Blake would make a ridiculous pass to Davis but he just didn't have enough lift to finish the play. I think Aldrich should fit the system well if he concentrates on defending and rebounding.  I'm very hopeful that this is the type of low-key signing that we've been waiting for Doc to make.
LAClippers,3d0fl2,nomoneyrico,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:04:36 2015 UTC,I'm glad we're not getting Javalle. He might play defense when we're on offense or he might score on the wrong basket.
LAClippers,3czl2q,LongElm,6,Sun Jul 12 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"2006 was a ray of light when the clips team has been total crap the years before since the early 90s- 2000's, it was the one year we went to the playoffs before blake"

LAClippers,3czl2q,uncle_meg,2,Sun Jul 12 14:00:22 2015 UTC,see /u/Vbpretend comment
LAClippers,3czl2q,NightmareSyx,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:25:15 2015 UTC,"Still their best playoff run IMHO. They nearly swept the Nuggets and played a hard-fought series with the Suns (except for Game 7). As much as I love the current line up, I think the 2006 Clippers could have done greater things if they stayed together and healthy."
LAClippers,3czd6m,Sam_Malone575,19,Sun Jul 12 04:01:03 2015 UTC,No. dude panics when he holds the ball for more than 3 seconds.
LAClippers,3czd6m,Shoobedowop,12,Sun Jul 12 04:29:41 2015 UTC,Almost always travels whenever he tries a post move. He is very limited
LAClippers,3czd6m,jeepinjosh,6,Sun Jul 12 05:45:50 2015 UTC,Yup. If he wants an expanded role he's gotta work on his game. Work on his post moves and probably his free throws. The only thing he reliably scores on right now is put backs and oops. If the ball has to touch the court then he's usually fucked.
LAClippers,3czd6m,freeogy,9,Sun Jul 12 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"Looking at the season stat leaders DJ is 1st in Defensive Win Shares, and tied with LeBron at 8/9 in Offensive Win Shares, making him 5th in Win Shares overall. His usage percentage is towards the bottom for the team.   As far as the former stats, CP3 and Blake (and sometimes JJ) are all up there in the mix in the top 20 for the league.   DJ is very good at what he does, but his skill is very narrow. If he already had a mid-to-short range jumper or some dribbling skill, he could complain. But he does not. (Forget free throws.) If he catches the ball anywhere on the outside he just waits for a guard to finally bail him out. So with all that, the team fed him his best possible game and it has produced results. Clipper lack of depth eventually led to their downfall. However, DJ is a solid piece in the Clipper Big Three.   Ultimately, DJ's offense is limited by his lack of ball handling and outside shooting. And so his usage will always be limited by that. What Mavs had promised him was just never gonna happen."
LAClippers,3czd6m,ghostzanit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:51:29 2015 UTC,What he said ^
LAClippers,3czd6m,smurphii,4,Mon Jul 13 10:04:59 2015 UTC,"No he is being utilized the best in our current offense that we ran last year. well unless he learns any post moves which he currently has none of. His range is the length of his arm, he makes lay ups and dunks only. Now he is the best at making lay ups and dunks but they have to be created for him. The clippers may try to run more plays that can end in DJ getting a shot but on the starting line up hes going to be the 3rd to 5th option on any given play."
LAClippers,3czd6m,bwhite9,7,Sun Jul 12 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"My concern, especially now, is that he gets all pouty if he doesn't get the ball."
LAClippers,3czd6m,ragnartheblue,6,Sun Jul 12 04:47:54 2015 UTC,Our players were missing plenty of opportunities to feed the big man this year. The team should have it drilled into them that DJ should be accounted for at all times to see if he is in good position. He deserves the ball.
LAClippers,3czd6m,clipperfury,3,Sun Jul 12 05:51:16 2015 UTC,"4 years ago or so, he opened the season displaying a limited array of post ""moves.""  Note that moves was in quotes because really it was either just a standing jump hook (that rarely went in) or a running jump hook across the key (that also rarely went in.)  I think it lasted about 15 games before it was never seen again.  I assume it was Vinny who shut it down, but he also may have just given up due to frustration as well.  Or a combo of both.  As mentioned elsewhere I don't think he has the skillset to do much more on offense.  We have maximized what he is capable of so unless there's a serious breakdown of his skills (similar to how some players like Blake have changed their entire shooting motion) to build them back up from scratch I think he may make an occasional haphazard post move now and again, but nothing more."
LAClippers,3czd6m,tmoam,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:46 2015 UTC,No but if he does expect a lot of sky hooks or jump hooks
LAClippers,3czd6m,michaellapointe,2,Sun Jul 12 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I do think there are times when throwing the ball to DJ down low for one dribble and a push to the rim is a good, and under-utilized option (Mike Smith harps on this during broadcasts). But he needs any kind of shot before we can start thinking of him as a legitimate offensive option."
LAClippers,3czd6m,pulling_strings,2,Sun Jul 12 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"i actually think so.  his hookshot on the right block actually isn't bad.  something i put together in the 2013 offseason   New to his game last year was being put in the post in over 25% of his used offensive possessions.   In these possessions he turned it over only 13% of the time and 16% of his made shots were and-1s, both above average to good figures indicative of ball protection and some ability to finish through contact.   he surely has shortcomings in the post--a few of those turnovers are actually travels, and he might have to expend some of his more valuable defensive energy running the floor harder and fighting for post position around 15-17 feet because he's uhh, not exactly a hakeem or dirk-level ball handler coming in from the 3 point line; his go to move down low looks simple and direct, but he does a lot of things right.   he stands tall and strong, doesnt spread his base too wide, uses long strides and quickness to spin away or step by his defender, pivots keeping the ball high, and his long arms provide a high release point for a jump hook that's hard to block and goes in a lot, so he's got that going for him. his shooting percentages in the post are better than most, with a hook shot dropping in at 57%, and an overall shooting clip of roughly 50%. his usage down there, as well as his conversion rate have been steadily increasing and are higher than ever. its somewhat impressive when you compare that field goal percentage to post-up monster Marc Gasol's--who comes in at 44 fg%, though not as simple as a direct comparison because gasol is doing it more than twice as much per36 minutes. but he has been working on his offensive game since his college days, and its no longer the poor shooting or post scoring fundamentals he has a problem with.   here's an example of his ability to spin away over his left shoulder with his off hand. clippers fans saw his post play five times more often in 2013 than in 2012, and far more than highlights or a few national broadcasts might lead you to believe. the improvement over the years has been obvious but rarely mentioned.   that said, griffin is better in the post, but it might be useful to put DJ down there early on in the game even if just to draw fouls"
LAClippers,3czd6m,BL4K3_00,2,Sun Jul 12 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like he should get a little bit more offensive opportunities. He doesn't seem like he has played most of his life like most other players in the nba, so he should not be a go to guy, but I feel like he should get a couple more screen, cut to the rim, then lob/pass type plays a game."

LAClippers,3cxcur,REDUCE5231,10,Sat Jul 11 19:28:21 2015 UTC,Seriously why didn't the Mavs keep Chandler and build a team?
LAClippers,3cxcur,1800KitchenFire,6,Sat Jul 11 21:53:20 2015 UTC,"Jordan was the prize. Younger, less injury history. Hell if I know. Chandler brought an attitude and charisma that made everyone around him better. Definitely a guy you want on your team."
LAClippers,3cxcur,MrPotatoSmegma,12,Sat Jul 11 23:44:26 2015 UTC,Tell it like it is Tyson
LAClippers,3cxcur,lakeGriffin,4,Sat Jul 11 16:57:42 2015 UTC,Tyson Chandler>Chandler Parsons
LAClippers,3cxcur,Mista123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:39:33 2015 UTC,Battle of the Chandler?
LAClippers,3cxcur,ZZeyak,3,Sun Jul 12 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"Damn Tyson Chandler is a really cool dude, I didn't know that. Answered every question honestly without a bs response, not to mention he was very patient considering the TMZ guy followed him for like 3 mins. Props to Chandler."
LAClippers,3cyppg,ragnartheblue,9,Sun Jul 12 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not a business day. I have no idea if NBA transactions only happen on week days, but I wouldn't be too worried. There's obviously no ""for sures"" until ink hits paper (thanks, DJ), but I wouldn't get worried until after Monday. The terms have been set and it's not like they're massive FA targets, so I'm sure we'll be alright."
LAClippers,3cyppg,lakeGriffin,7,Sun Jul 12 00:10:44 2015 UTC,and Wilson Chandler just signed an extension w/ Denver... looks like that Jamal trade is as good as dead.
LAClippers,3cyppg,doinnothin,6,Sun Jul 12 03:16:26 2015 UTC,that was dead the moment the contract was guaranteed
LAClippers,3cyppg,clayfu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:24:24 2015 UTC,we can still get danillo? maybe?
LAClippers,3cyppg,blake32griffin,3,Sun Jul 12 10:32:38 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard of other teams really going after Rivers. Like lakeGriffin said, it probably died down over the weekend. Hopefully will see them both signed on Monday."
LAClippers,3cyppg,jeepinjosh,3,Sun Jul 12 01:17:55 2015 UTC,Probably monday.
LAClippers,3cyppg,Shoobedowop,2,Sun Jul 12 01:38:55 2015 UTC,maaan if he doesn't sign i'm gonna be disappointed. i feel he still has a lot to prove.
LAClippers,3cxhol,blake32griffin,2,Sat Jul 11 17:31:50 2015 UTC,Please re-sign!
LAClippers,3cxhol,ragnartheblue,2,Sat Jul 11 19:33:04 2015 UTC,He is going to be great. Mark my words
LAClippers,3cx5ni,blake32griffin,6,Sat Jul 11 15:44:06 2015 UTC,Hope not. Need to move Jamal for something of use. Hopefully a 3 and D starter but I'm not gonna get my hopes up on that. Would like to get McGee to split backup minutes with Aldrich. Arthur and Smith would be great adds. I also hope they look at Jameer Nelson for more shooting in our guard depth
LAClippers,3cx5ni,spoonymoonchair,5,Sat Jul 11 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"I think Wes Johnson could be that 3 and D starter, he shot 36% last year for the lakers which means he will probably shoot even better if he's getting passes from CP3 and as the 5th option in the leagues best offense. I like his defensive potential too, long athletic and he's thin but seems to posses some of that wiry strength."
LAClippers,3cx5ni,idontpopmolly10,2,Sun Jul 12 02:32:24 2015 UTC,Agreed hope he starts over Pierce. And I hope Doc doesn't overplay Pierce like he did with Jamal.
LAClippers,3cx5ni,spoonymoonchair,3,Sun Jul 12 03:38:10 2015 UTC,yeah ideally pierce plays about 20 minutes a game for 55 games this year and stays fresh for the playoffs. Lance can steal a lot of minutes at the 3 too
LAClippers,3cx5ni,idontpopmolly10,2,Sun Jul 12 04:30:09 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kpykLuglaM  i'm optimistic
LAClippers,3cx5ni,theSUMisONE,3,Sun Jul 12 09:04:27 2015 UTC,If we can flip Jamal for a backup PF and sign McGee for vet min I think we would be complete
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Im_a_Mime,5,Sat Jul 11 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, the Clippers are still making moves, I think. Obviously the Jamal trade will probably happen sooner or later, but possibly not until the season starts.  They're still interested in a 3rd big (Josh Smith or Darrell Arthur) to round out the second unit. Other than that the rotation is mostly set, it's just third-stringers and bench chemistry types.  They'll get a 3rd point guard, probably more of a pure PG type who can step up if/when CP3 gets hurt and play backup minutes for a stretch.  I think they should still look for a 3rd SF, since Pierce will get rests/injuries, and Wes Johnson is still a little unproven. That sort of player would be good to also play in smallball bench lineups allowing Pierce to slide over to the 4. Think of someone like Tayshaun Prince, Dorell Wright, maybe Rasual Butler."
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Chad3000,3,Sat Jul 11 16:59:42 2015 UTC,Blasphemy! Do not speak of this action! (CP3 getting hurt)
LAClippers,3cx5ni,2_uber,3,Sat Jul 11 19:58:26 2015 UTC,We use crawford/wilcox for something and sign Josh Smith. I feel like a playoff team lacking a bench might be able to make J cross useful. I hope he does well but I don't think he's what we need right now.
LAClippers,3cx5ni,clipperw2014,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:56:50 2015 UTC,ya i think we still have roster spots to fill with min guys. A crawford/wilcox.
LAClippers,3cx5ni,bwhite9,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:28:44 2015 UTC,Cavs for Haywood's contract. Be their new JR.
LAClippers,3cx5ni,2_uber,3,Sat Jul 11 19:56:56 2015 UTC,I think we should trade Crawford for Haywards contract then dump him for a Wilson Chandler that would be idea
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Vbpretend,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:12:58 2015 UTC,Haywood is worth nothing as a player.
LAClippers,3cx5ni,2_uber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"no i mean that we get a 10 million dollars from his non guaranteed contract so we trade that for Wilson, like we pay cash + cj or something for wilson"
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Vbpretend,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"Nah I know what you're saying, I'm just messing with you cause others have said that Haywood is worth nothing as a player."
LAClippers,3cx5ni,2_uber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:05:25 2015 UTC,oh ok lol
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Vbpretend,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:16:45 2015 UTC,"We cant use Haywood anymore, because with DJ's signing we are well over the cap (even after dumping 10M)"
LAClippers,3cx5ni,iamkarlhungus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't work, we are over the cap since DeAndre signed."
LAClippers,3cx5ni,Phlygone,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:41:38 2015 UTC,Who can we get for Crawford?
LAClippers,3cx5ni,highastronaut,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:50:31 2015 UTC,Josh Smith? If we don't sign him
LAClippers,3cx5ni,BL4K3_00,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:10:35 2015 UTC,"I think Josh Smith would seal the deal for us.  I do not think we go after Javale.  Sure, we could use the depth, but I don't think Chris could handle him."
LAClippers,3cvikg,BMC4,37,Sat Jul 11 03:06:57 2015 UTC,I fucking love Paul Pierce
LAClippers,3cvikg,RedditIsTheDevil,16,Sat Jul 11 03:19:56 2015 UTC,His trolling abilities are like fine wine.
LAClippers,3cvikg,celtic-pride1,9,Sat Jul 11 04:51:59 2015 UTC,When talking to my laker friends... I always bring up the wheel chair.  Such a hot button for them. I love it
LAClippers,3cvikg,RedditIsTheDevil,2,Sat Jul 11 04:56:16 2015 UTC,Hopefully his playing abilities too.
LAClippers,3cvikg,2_uber,16,Sat Jul 11 19:55:44 2015 UTC,So happy we got him
LAClippers,3cvikg,clipperw2014,11,Sat Jul 11 03:21:43 2015 UTC,I wonder if some of these are the wack ass emojis JJ was talking about
LAClippers,3cvikg,lakeGriffin,8,Sat Jul 11 03:31:20 2015 UTC,Did you not see his rocketship clip art?
LAClippers,3cvikg,RedditIsTheDevil,9,Sat Jul 11 03:57:28 2015 UTC,It was a joke. JJ said on the Lowe post that Pierce has a couple emoji apps he's never heard of and some weird emojis he's never seen before
LAClippers,3cvikg,lakeGriffin,8,Sat Jul 11 04:38:51 2015 UTC,"When I listened to that interview the only thing I said to myself was, ""Fuckin Paul Pierce would have 2 or 3 emoji apps, heh""."
LAClippers,3cvikg,ozreteidderf,4,Sat Jul 11 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Shit.  As a humorless individual, I did not realize you were joking.  Carry on, good sir.  Tips m'DJ"

LAClippers,3cvikg,fastblackman17,8,Sat Jul 11 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like Pierce's role should be well defined. Start games at the 3, play limited minutes, and finish games if needed. Provide mental toughness, fill in at the 4 from time to time, and buoy everyone's spirit. Oh and playoff clutch performance."
LAClippers,3cvikg,rugtap,5,Sat Jul 11 04:36:33 2015 UTC,I just ordered my PP jersey fucking stoked
