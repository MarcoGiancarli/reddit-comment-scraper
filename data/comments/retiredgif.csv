No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a redditor who studies memes, I am telling you, specifically, in most subs, no one calls Unidan obscure. If you want to talk about a ""large handful"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not just a handful.  If you're saying ""well known"" you're referring to the unofficial grouping of power users, which includes things from admins to mods to reddit celebrities.  So your reasoning for calling Unidan obscure is because random people ""maybe know who he is?"" Let's get Warlizard and the guy with two penises in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone obscure but known by a large handful of people? It's not one or the other, that's not how meta-reddit works. They're both. Unidan is Unidan and a member of the power user family. But that's not what you said. You said Unidan is obscure, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the power user family obscure, which means you'd call admins, mods, and Victoria obscure, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?  (Does that ring a bell at all? Unidan wrote the original copypasta, and it sort of set off his ban.)"

The gif is from ""Black Adder"", a British TV series, and the man in the gif is Edmond the Black Adder.  It's been a while since I've seen the show, but I believe the gif is from the episode where Edmond is thinking about ways to make a particular woman not want to marry him and someone suggests that he make her think he ""prefers the company of men"". He says ""of course I do!"" But then the man he's speaking to clarifies with a reference to a gay person they know. The next scene he dresses flamboyantly and someone mistakes him for that gay man."

Second relevant element: ...  Rule 6 - must have more than one relevant element. Needs more relevant elements.   Now we could easily say the first element is flexing and the second is unconsciousness/death. The sidebar doesn't define ""element"" so this further separation is acceptable (no matter how much I don't like it. This is our subreddit however, not mine). We'd have two elements so what's the problem? The score is the problem, this won't get more than 10 votes.

retiredgif,38otrl,jonnyd005,7,Fri Jun 5 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"Also, mods it would be nice if you would enforce this rule.   We've discussed this internally a bit, several months ago. However, there's only 3 active mods, so some community discussion would be welcome to see more points of view.  Right now, our action on Rule 5 is to flair the post as a reminder. Rule 5 is a little complex for newcomers, and having your post removed can be very off-putting for someone who isn't familiar with the subreddit.  My personal belief is that it's best to err on the side of caution. As it is, we curate the subreddit by removing posts that break the rules (especially #6) but Rule 5 just gets a ""warning"" in the form of a flair. Reddit has its fair share of communities with heavy-handed moderation, including many where the majority of users have called for the mods to step down. The last thing we want is for our users to think anyone is on a ""power trip"", so the fact that we're being asked to take more action instead of complaining that we're overzealous isn't a bad thing in my eyes.  We have the following already in our CSS as a reminder when people post:   [username] retires a gif of [EXTREMELY VAGUE description of gif (see rule 5)]   People may be getting confused, or ignoring it, or both. The more complicated the rules, the more likely people are to ignore them. /u/kukamunga is strongly against rule complexity and I agree with him on this.  Someone made this great infographic a while back about how to post on /r/RetiredGif. Maybe it could be updated? I think we're all open to ideas."

Extremely vague leaves it up for interpretation whereas stating it as only one leaves little room for interpretation."

I can't find record of the exact wording but I think it was [description of ONE AND ONLY ONE relevant element]. As it turns out, not everyone (especially newcomers) understand or agree what constitutes a single relevant element. I've been thinking of changing it to [ONE WORD OR NAME TO DESCRIBE THE GIF]. What do you think?  edit: fuck it, it's Friday. I'm doing serious reddit modding at work. Fixed the handy guide and updated the wording of rule 5 and the submit template because I think limiting it to one word (or name) is a good way to remove ambiguity. /u/poptart2nd, /u/lolzergrush, /u/NotMathMan821, feel free to remove posts based on the new wording (or scold me for making this decision unilaterally)"

retiredgif,35uk9b,shatters,3,Wed May 13 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"I consider this a retired gif, even though it doesn't fulfill requirement #6. I think requirement #6 is bad and wrong."
retiredgif,35uk9b,JViz,12,Wed May 13 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"Rule 6 is, in my opinion, the most important rule. It is what separates mere relevance from retired. Retired is meant to be the end all be all of a gif's usage, relevance can come from thousands of different ways."
retiredgif,35uk9b,oneeyednewt,4,Wed May 13 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"Rule 6 is vague attempt to quantify relevance. IMHO it does more harm than good, since it's a great source of false positives. I think up votes should be the determining factor in its place."
retiredgif,35uk9b,JViz,5,Wed May 13 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"The 6 rules define what ""retiring"" a gif means. They are arbitrary and mean different things to different people. To say that opvotes should be the only determinate of retired status would be to give the power to mob mentality (because that's a lot of what reddit is). The rules are guidelines set down by the subreddit creator and/or moderators to lay down tracks of order in the anarchy that is reddit voting. We could change the rule to instead say:   The gif must be more than merely relevant; that is, the gif must be posted by the creator of the gif, the gifs content, the subject matter of the gif, or be posted by a llama or lama.   That would be a dumb and pointless rule but it illustrates the arbitrary nature of it. This sub would be flooded with ""merely relevant"" gifs left and right (moreso than it already is) were it not for that rule. It is, in my opinion, the most important rule for what it means to be ACTUALLY retired and not just some gif that tangentially relates to what was said and is also funny. There is definitely room for grey area, but that has to be examined case-by-case."
retiredgif,35uk9b,oneeyednewt,3,Wed May 13 23:25:57 2015 UTC,"The rules in the sidebar are for guiding what people submit, and also the basis for mod actions. We curate the subreddit in order to prevent this place from just becoming /r/ReactionGifs - not there's anything wrong with that sub but it serves a different purpose.  Rule 6 is the outcome of many discussions within the community. The overall point is so that we're not using our judgment subjectively. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but it's the best objective criteria that's been proposed so far. It does filter out 95% of the garbage while keeping a relatively high proportion of good posts. (For reference, you won't find a Rule 6 violation anywhere in the top 100 posts on /r/RetiredGif.)  Upvotes are the determining factor in what constitutes a ""good"" retirement as determined by the community. We will (hopefully) never use that as a basis for removing submissions. The tradeoff is that sometimes we have to remove submissions that a lot of people are supporting - such as upvote gifs involving a celebrity doing an AMA.  Anyway, in this case it certainly satisfies Rule 6 with two points relevant to the context:   Prosthetic arm Masturbation aid   Without both of these elements, it wouldn't be nearly as good, so the rationale for Rule 6 is apparent."

retiredgif,35uk9b,FeralCactus,2,Thu May 14 12:31:28 2015 UTC,"At the very least you got to see some great gifs! There was a lot of discussion that led to Rule 6, mostly by looking at what all of the best retirements had in common, namely that it took more than just one element for it to be a great gif.  I've always felt that we need a mechanism for making an exception - when a gif is just so uncanny that it's unbelievable, even if there's only one element. It's rare but sometimes there's just that one perfect gif. Unfortunately there isn't anyway to do this without creating more bureaucracy, or basically giving mods a ""king's decree"" to override the rules and we don't want that. All the mods here are very against power-tripping because we see it happen on other subs."
retiredgif,35uk9b,oneeyednewt,2,Thu May 14 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"Doesn't it? It relates to both the prosthetic limb and the fleshlight, or am I not understanding the rule?"
retiredgif,35uk9b,FeralCactus,3,Wed May 13 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"The two elements that I think could be attributed to this are masturbation and the prosthesis. When you view the full context of the gif as opposed to just to two comments prior like OP linked to, someone asks the one armed guy if he can fap. I think, for that reason, this gif very loosely meets rule 6, but isn't retired, due to the fact that the original picture didn't have a prosthesis, there is no fleshlight in the gif, and the fact that the gif has potential for a much more retire-able post thanks to how many possible elements are in the gif."

retiredgif,35uk9b,oneeyednewt,0,Thu May 14 01:48:53 2015 UTC,"The prosthetic limb is considered part of ""being"", like if someone is a man or a woman, and the gif is of a man or a woman. That means the fapping is the only relevant thing in the gif. It's a vague interpretation of the definition that makes more things fail the requirement that should."

retiredgif,33yqmc,unoriginalsin,9,Mon Apr 27 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"The whole point of it is to make the subreddit less about relevance and more about retire-ability. This subreddit is not for merely relevant gifs, it's for retired gifs. To be retired it has to be more than just relevant, it has to fit so unimaginably perfectly that it cannot be used in a better way ever again.  This particular post falls into a grey area in my opinion because it doesn't have any more elements to be relevant to. I would say a second element could be the gif cat being tired at the end, but even without it on this particular one I'm leaning more towards retired, and I'm usually not very lenient about retired gifs."
retiredgif,33yqmc,oneeyednewt,7,Mon Apr 27 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"The short answer is: we have to draw the line somewhere.  As for the reasoning why, I'd suggest community discussion would be the best way to bring about change. I don't think any of the moderators want to impose rule changes without consensus from the community - which is what led to these rules in the first place. Considerable discussion and revision went into creating the rules that we have now, but of course there's always room for improvement indefinitely.  There are an awful lot of generic reaction gifs, barely-relevant gifs and others that we remove every day. We'd simply turn into /r/ReactionGifs if we didn't, and there's no need for two subreddits to serve the same purpose. There has to be some sort of objective criteria to draw the line. The current incarnation of the rules may not be perfect, but it's the best we have so far.   What we don't want is moderators saying ""yes that one is good, that one is bad"" and removing accordingly. That's entirely subjective and based on personal opinion. If you notice the six rules are objective, and as long as someone can articulate a reason why a post meets all 6 rules we don't remove it. But since our subreddit doesn't get hundreds of posts per day, whatever gets posted is what shows up on the front page. As a result the community has asked us to curate the subreddit since the voting system alone can't keep the front page clean."

Danny makes fun of him and tells him that he needs to be more serious if he wants to be believed. So Jonah says, very seriously, ""Fatalities"".

Seth Rollins turned on the other two and sided with ""The Authority"" which is pretty much the corporate stable. Rollins ""sold out"" and turned his back on fans and his friends. He won something called the Money in the Bank which means he can ""cash in"" any time for a championship match.   Today was Wrestlemania (Super Bowl of Wrestling) and Roman Reigns was fighting Brock Lesnar (Champion) for the title. They were in the middle of a long and hellacious fight which left both men hurt. All of a sudden, Seth Rollins' music hit and he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract turning the match into a three-way fight. Rollins, being the fresh man, quickly got the victory by pinning Reigns who was practically destroyed by Lesnar.   tl;dr - Rollins sneaks into the picture and steals the show from Reigns in both the gif and Wrestlemania."

retiredgif,2rx1nh,Nice_Dude,37,Sat Jan 10 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"I hear you, and this has been brought up before. The problem is that the context can't always be described with text in the form of a title. Often times the parent is a picture or video, and asking the OP to describe the parent without just describing all the parts that are relevant to the gif is just as difficult as asking them not to over-describe the gif.  Now, my assumption before was that it would be easier to get people to just under-describe the gif, i.e. describe only one element per rule 5.   Rule 5 in the sidebar wasn't enough, so we started posting mod comments reminding people about it.  That wasn't enough so we started adding flair to posts that broke rule 5.  That wasn't enough, so I changed the submit link to have a plainly worded template: [username] retires a gif of [EXTREMELY VAGUE description of gif (see rule 5)]  Clearly that still hasn't worked. I really do believe that people will have a hard time adhering to your proposal, but I'm getting a little desperate.

The gif is of someone telling someone else to GTFO.  However, due to the rules of this subreddit, I cannot link the entire thread and must link the specific post containing the gif. That's why the context isn't as clear as it could be.

Simply posting that gif in response to someone talking about a baboon making suggestive motions would have been more relevant, but far less entertaining.

As for containing more than one relevant element, I'm not sure where you're saying that it doesn't work. The implication of him being the 'creamy center guy' is relevant on its own, and his expression is also relevant in the context of him responding to the question. Does that not meet the requirement?"

retiredgif,2n27jv,lolzergrush,2,Sun Nov 23 07:22:37 2014 UTC,"""What Is Love?"" was an internet fad for a long time, particularly on the website YTMND. Gifs were made for virtually every conceivable context.  Another Star Wars example that would be equally relevant. You could post them in Star Trek discussions, a conversation about the movie Encino Man, or Sonic the Hedgehog, Megaman, Phillips CD-i, talking about The Muppet Movie, the TV show The Office, and so on.  (edit: changed to gif links. YTMND is somewhat outdated and requires flash, so it won't work well on mobile.)  Anytime someone references the lyrics to ""What Is Love?"", regardless of the context, there will be an amazingly relevant gif because of all the ones that were made pertaining this fad."
