ruralporn,3e0010,delofan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:00 2015 UTC,Fantastic picture. I went to college in Lancaster for the past two years. I've probably passed that farm. Do you know exactly (or generally) where it was taken?
ruralporn,3e0010,Grimsrasatoas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's taken on rt896, just a wee bit south of the Strasbourg railroad area."
ruralporn,3e0010,Grimsrasatoas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. That's too far south of where I usually drove through to get to school or the surrounding area."
ruralporn,3e0010,TheKnowledgeKBI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:28 2015 UTC,I drive past this almost everyday and always think what a great picaresque view it is. This is a great shot!

ruralporn,3de4ch,tanked_as,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:41 2015 UTC,Looking at this picture actually made me sad because I'm not there right now.
ruralporn,3de4ch,GrungeLord,2,Thu Jul 16 04:04:34 2015 UTC,Somehow this view reminds me of the 70s movie Eiger Sanction.
ruralporn,3de4ch,deluxe3000,2,Thu Jul 16 10:29:47 2015 UTC,This photo makes me want to run out and buy an alpenhorn.
