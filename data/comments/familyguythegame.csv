We're only five, but the two of us who drunk-purchased a pack are the only two who has yet to get these advertisements.

No thanks.   That said, I have a fair amount of free space but a lot of others don't & more land would be nice. A strip along the entire length of the top right side the width of a district would be fine for a while. More districts could expand alongside 8, 9, 10, & the assumed district 11 that's below 10 right now. Even that much might be pushing it until devices get better & TinyCo works on making object file sizes & the game in general more efficient etc.  Better consistency of building sizes would also help some. There doesn't seem to be a template for sizing or standard scale for things, with doors & storefronts being different widths/heights on one building vs the next. Lately some buildings are bigger than they need to be & putting new ones next to old ones is a joke. A lot of buildings from the mobster event would've looked fine scaled down to 3/4 their footprint (or smaller) & would've fit in better compared to the size of older buildings.   Aside from that, a lot of people just have way too many roads eating up space. I see screen shots all the time where people have roads surrounding just 1 or 2 buildings & that just repeats. It doesn't look natural & they end up with 10 buildings & a bunch of roads in a space they could have 20 buildings & still have roads with good separation & visibility."
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,RumbleZ28,2,Tue Jul 14 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"It's not a choice on TinyCo's part, the game simply will not run well with that much space. When I had a full, decorated town it was slow as hell. I ditched everything non-essential and it runs fine now (iPad 2).  The real problems:   each event gives us a dozen new buildings. there is a penalty for having lots of roads when clicking wandering event mobs."
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,Maskatron,2,Tue Jul 14 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"You have a real creative mind there rejecting the idea of five times the land. Sure, you can fit in more buildings  but does that mean that boring strip of buildings look good?   I am guilty of placing lots of roads around buildings but all of the spaces are occupied by decorations that actually look good and make the town livelier. This is a collection of old screenshots from my town, more land was added and I have newer stuff. I wonder how your town compares to mine in term of better looks. http://m.imgur.com/a/kDjGA"
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,Shiios42,0,Wed Jul 15 10:07:58 2015 UTC,Looks are just a matter of opinion. Rejecting the idea of 5 times the land had nothing to do with creativity & everything to do with this game not running well with that much stuff.   My point on roads was mainly that we know we only have so much land & there will be more buildings all the time.  And still a lot of people waste the space we have to more roads than needed & then complain there's no room. Nothing wrong with having decos & being creative but it's possible to do that without having roads around every building zig-zagging through the town.  I've seen your pics before & I've seen much worse. Obviously you've spent some time on your town & if it makes you happy & you think that's what a town should look like that's great. It's your town & it doesn't really matter what I think about it. You're the one who has to look at it & deal with where to put new things in the space we have available to us.
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,RumbleZ28,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"What device are you using? Because as far as I understand they are only limiting the land capacity due to maintining support for outdated low end devices, have an ipad 4 which is actually two years behind but runs buttery smooth and I'm sure it can deal 5 times that much land. tapped out made it so with that huge chunk of land despite having fewer items, so why not here?  Also, your statement is a bit conflicted since you have no care what I deemed to look like a good town and yet you criticize those that use more roads as unnatural looking? Let's be honest, people want to showcase their winnings, and theming is supposed to be a major part of the game. Even if you have the bare minimum essential roads, It would always be just a strip with no distinctivity to set it apart from the others.  I have seen towns with about 60-70 percent decor only and it looks actually amazing. I'd prefer that over any other strips of buildings lined up horizontally. Maybe for some people the thrill is  just getting the items themselves as a sense of achievement even though it would be likely be just stored in the inventory due to lack of land."

familyguythegame,3d7qbq,gasm_spasm,0,Tue Jul 14 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of torn on this. One of my problems with TSTO is that the town got so massive it took forever to find roaming whatevers and tap on all the buildings to collect money. So I kind of like the smaller space in this game comparatively.  That said, you get a LOT of buildings and decorations and have a lot less space to put them all, so you have to make some decisions on what you're going to display and you have to leave room for new buildings from events as well, so it's kind of annoying."
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,Necrofamicom,-5,Tue Jul 14 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"I want to start by saying I really hate all these F* TinyCo posts and comments. It's a free game, and I get some enjoyment out of it; my contract with TinyCo is fulfilled.    Just because your own personal entertainment needs are being met as a free player, this does not mean others (free or paying) don't have the right to complain about TinyCo and its issues. If you don't like reading them, don't click them.  BTW: Fuck TinyCo."
familyguythegame,3d7qbq,halo_nothing,2,Tue Jul 14 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"The freemium model of these idle games used to be something to the effect of 'You can play for free, but it will be work to get through everything, or you can pay to skip some of the time.' This is no longer the case with TinyCo's approach to game design where you need to pay real cash to get through the normal quest lines of a full event.   Granted, the last event was a masterclass in awful design, but it just highlighted how TinyCo now only really care about squeezing whales dry. As they have pushed more towards those who will spend a lot, those who won't have stopped spending at all or have quit the game, so they have to squeeze those few people harder and harder making the game now broken and deceptive as a freemium game."

He simply said he hated them, and even implied that he might jump on that bandwagon if TinyCo didn't do something about the land issue.  As a matter of fact, he's actually exercising his ""right to complain about TinyCo and its issues"" -- but maybe you didn't get that far."

I think Mort tells you in a dialog box (after you tap it) to tap the button in the dialog box to watch (there's a no thanks button also) and it plays with no problem at all. It started to appear about every 24 hours during the mobster event, sometimes playing 6 videos in a row, but disappeared after a week (with update 1.9.7). Came back with 1.10.0 after the mobster event ended. Still about every 24 hours but one video at a time, although it reappears periodically for a few hours (every time I relaunch the game). I've been getting 4 clams per day from it (one clam at a time) for the past couple of days.   Everything's better with free clams... I like the videos, they're lively (mostly for games, although one had a little interactive mini game in an ad for an antihistamine). This is a great way to get revenue painlessly from cheapskates like me who won't buy clams. If you don't want to watch, just ignore the bouncing clam above the tv or hit the no, thanks button when Mort comes up. But -- free clams!

I can't imagine how much more stuff people who actually spend money on this game have."
familyguythegame,3cs1xy,chejrw,4,Fri Jul 10 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"Since coins are nearly useless, and decorations just slow the game down, I've found that keeping every building in inventory except whatever is being used for an event has helped a lot.  Except that damned brewery. I've crafted everything so there's no drops for it, yet it's STILL ""too important to put away""."
familyguythegame,3cs1xy,nikapo,0,Fri Jul 10 19:58:11 2015 UTC,What? Is this game still going? I thought it broke down for good.

And if I put away most of the coin producing buildings that aren't used for anything else, in other words, the useless ones, I get even more space.  Buildings are useless after you have a few million coins. Just keep the ones you need and the ones you like best if you're that tight on space."

It seems like they're just pushing people to using clams to speed up things so they get them in time, which is a shitty tactic but par for the course with TinyCo."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,flux365,12,Thu Jul 9 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"I love the concept but the implementation was terrible, at least after week 1, hire 55 showgirls while sending 15 of each thug to fort nox, while hiring 20+whise guys, Yakisoba, etc is just too much for only 6 spaces of creation."

familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Rich73,9,Fri Jul 10 00:02:11 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. I too was playing non stop and could not get anything done. Couldn't get tricia at all due to the 20k and failed to to get Bonnie. Too many long tasks which hold up the game, which I suppose they expect you to rush with clams."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Enigma776,6,Fri Jul 10 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"This was a pretty bad event. Too much to do, not nearly enough time to do it. Tapped out might be a bit too lenient during events, I can usually earn a round or two of donuts before it ends, but this game is starting to feel like they want the users to suffer."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,heman8400,3,Fri Jul 10 01:42:56 2015 UTC,I am glad to be able to play again. I gave up on the game a week ago - crashed and bogged my system down. It's nice to have a breather.

familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Axel2134,2,Thu Jul 9 23:18:18 2015 UTC,"She was of no use apart from getting cookies! Spent 20k cookies on her instead of 7.5k on Louise, who I missed out on by ~1000 cookies.   And I agree there was way too much to do at any one time. Guess it was to get users to buy clams, used 100 of mine but didn't pay for them nor do I intend to. EVER!  On another note - leader board prizes get given when? Think I read next week but unsure."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,yuhche,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:39:39 2015 UTC,"I had over 20k cookies, but I decided to hit the mystery boxes instead. I ended up getting the one decoration I wanted, but got 4 of the same fountain in the process. I was 2 lip glosses away from Bonnie's skin. I assume they didn't extend it because they have a premium/money-grab, limited event planned for this weekend. (edit, It's already started)  I was able to finish in the 5k-10k range. I just hope TinyCo doesn't screw me out of my prize and say I dropped 4,000 places on their view of the boards."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Rosshk,5,Fri Jul 10 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"I got Consuela but never even saw Bonnie or Scrotes. Only got Lois and the final mansion a few hours before it ended because I spent 60 clams to finish up her requirements. I think I finished at 48k for yellow stewie but could easily have been bumped at the last minute.  I blame Cleveland Jr, he was my roadblock for a long time. Complained to TinyCo, never got a response.  Star Trek event I finished completely. This one I missed out on 1/4 of the content.   It's also not my main complaint, but TinyCo, please stop with all the event buildings! There is no room for them at all, they'll all be in storage soon."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Maskatron,2,Fri Jul 10 00:29:19 2015 UTC,"So many players are going to dump this game after this event I couldn't even play for the first week, with the Futurama game coming it just puts another nail in the coffin. It's too bad I've played since the beginning but it's just progressively gotten worse, in every aspect tapped out is leaps and bounds ahead of this game. Unless you're a die hard family guy fan there's really no reason to stay that I can see."

familyguythegame,3cqbxf,Dream_the_Unpossible,3,Sun Jul 12 02:51:21 2015 UTC,Much worse. Couldn't even finish out the event due to my game crashing on the loading screen. TinyCo gets worse and worse.
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,2,Thu Jul 9 23:38:18 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, that week, or whatever, of the game constantly crashing would have made the difference. I was a few hundred away from Consuela, I was one more round through the casino, or whatever, to get Lois.   It makes it really annoying when you realize you really could have finished a lot of quests if the game didn't crash like that."
familyguythegame,3cqbxf,reddittrooper,2,Fri Jul 10 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"This was bad. Really bad.   I had no idea what I had to do to reach the next mansion-level (it seemed completely random that I was able to upgrade). 6 tabs to produce 55 thugs? Reeeeeeally? Yeah, that was so bad that the word ""bad"" is like a black hole of badness.   Thank you for closing this event. I endured it and reached some goals, but they even didn't matter that much for me. I knew right from the start that any character or skin I would achieve will be COMPLETELY USELESS for the future.  And I would like to slow-clap for our whales who spent lots of money$ for the priviledge to lead the leaderboards. Yaaaaay."

If they had sold a premium building that would have allowed us to create 2 at a time, I would have definitely bought that."

familyguythegame,3cq4rf,Oswarez,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"What I did is I nuked my town, then took all the characters out of storage. I would tap a character from the left hand icon, and for each task that had a necessary building, you tap the task and it brings you to the place in your inventory where that building is. Put that building on the land. Then I just did that one by one. There may be a faster way to do it, but since it takes you right to the building you need it works.   All my buildings are squished up in a corner because I don't care anymore how my town looks. Then I just have a small square of roadway that the characters walk through, which helps for events where you have to tap/bomb/whatever some NPC."

We're sorry to hear that you're currently experiencing crashing on the loading screen. This is a known issue, and our engineering team is working hard on a solution.

Some player reported that logging into their account on an iOS device has allowed them to log back in on their Android devices. If you don't have access to an iOS device, please also keep an eye out for new updates in your App Store that may resolve this issue.  Sorry for the frustration!

That's what I did, rather than spending cookies on Tricia or Bonnie costumes. Each cherry tree was 225 cookies, gave 45 fedoras. Each bamboo bunch was 50 cookies, gave 10 fedoras. Each golden origami crane was 5000 cookies, gave 1000 fedoras. Basically, every 5 cookies earned could be converted into 1 fedora in the store. I already had decided to buy loads of trees and bamboo and one or two cranes anyway with whatever I had at the end, so I kept buying up the stuff all that last day as cookies became available from tasks, buildings, hits on the fort, clearing an obstacle in the villa just in case disaster struck and I was afflicted with crashes (had been spared so far). I didn't get through the villa or knock down the fort one last time, but after waiting patiently for nine cops to incubate was able to take down the Don one more time with about 17 minutes to spare, quickly buying the last goodies (4 trees, 2 bamboos with 1000 cookies for another 200 fedoras to add to the 600 from the Don). Good thing I'm self-employed.... :)"

Actually, everything is optional in Week 5 because we don't need to meet requirements for the next stage anymore. So just forget about the FN quest and toss goons at it only when convenient. You'll still get good numbers of cookies and fedoras for every hit and it's a good way to get rid of overstocked goons if you need the space for the Don (such as now for me, since I need 15 wise guys for the 3rd round and that's my full capacity). Don't forget about the cop goon, who gets 30 fedoras every time he kicks over that poor fellow on the scooter. I'm just focusing on the Don and fitting in the Villa raids when they don't interfere with taking down the Don's henchmen. The Don is just a waiting game. Every time he recovers from his 4 hour nap, the 24 hour timer restarts for the next round. So it isn't hard to incubate the appropriate goon in the appropriate numbers with time to spare, even for the cop goon with a very long incubation time, as long as you're willing to give the Don priority over other goon uses. This is true even if you didn't plan on having an empty queue at the time the Don wakes up. So try to relax and enjoy. Have a cookie! :)"

The reason for that is simple. The event was ""ruined"" by TinyCo stupidity before the recent disappearing character issue. The unlock requirements for Cleveland Jr. were set unreasonably high and were combined with ridiculously poor drop rates, resulting in most people who don't use clams being set back roughly a full week.  There have also been other issues that contributed to the event sucking some pretty hefty balls, but the biggest problem for me was the significant set back with unlocking Cleveland Jr."

I finally just unlocked Don King Cleveland as well as Cleveland Jr and Diabeto, after that though I feel like I'm not even close to unlocking anyone else. I mean, I haven't even gotten to the point to where Lois' alternate skin is able to be unlocked. It's like there's just too much going on all at once to properly unlock anything. But what got me, and I started thinking this after the Star Trek even, is that the premium paid characters really aren't doing anything. It felt like in past events if you bought the premium character would help a ton throughout the whole event in different ways. This event though I swear the premium characters do maybe one thing and that's it. Hell, I have no clue what Robocop actually does."

I think I got Diabeto and Mr. Washee ... should be able to get the Lois costume, and right now am ranked high enough to get Zoot Suit Stewie. Plenty for me and I spent maybe 10 clams this whole time.   None of the clams-only characters seem worth it. Actually, they mostly seem out of place.

(which assume needs to be complete before I can upgrade... the game doesn't tell me this week), but now I need 9 french fries... which means 27 showgirls, at 45 minutes to hire each... so that's a full day of grinding nothing but show girls. So I can't take down fort nox like another main quest wants. And then I'm sure I'll need like 15 bags of cash for the last judge block, which will be 30 Yakisoba? thugs, for another 15 hours of grinding. So maybe I'll be able to upgrade the mansion by Monday?"
familyguythegame,3c0me4,netherfiend,2,Sat Jul 4 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"To answer OP's question, no. No clams, not ready, and it feels like I'm falling further and further behind because of various problems within the game.  TinyCo has gone full retard though, so it's not exactly surprising. Game issues, ridiculous unlock requirements, inability to proceed unless various quests and characters have been unlocked or paid for (if you're impatient and stupid)... When you can observe all of these things happening at once it's pretty obvious the people running the show, most likely product managers, are either new, greedy, or incompetent."
familyguythegame,3c0me4,-dudeman,2,Sat Jul 4 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"As someone who used clams, I don't think it's possible to be 'on schedule' without spending any clams. The recent mr. Washee washee screw-up didn't exactly help in that either."

Need 8 more money bags to get past the judge, have the nunchucks for it but am incubating the goons. Then can unlock mob Lois, and wait for her task to finish. Then I think I can upgrade the mansion.  Without clams, you just have to ignore the side quests unless easily done and focus on the main quest and the basic 3 raids and whatever character is essential for completing the main quest. Sometimes side quests get done while you're doing the Main Quest.  I collect stuff for non-essential characters (like schoolgirl costume for Tricia) when doable, but don't worry about finishing them (like I'm really going to pay 20,000 cookies for that.... All her stuff is collected, though, in case I get a windfall.). I do buy all the buildings sold for cookies asap but only buy needed decos until the very end when I see how many cookies I have left, then I buy more of ones I like. Also ignore the leaderboard, it's just depressing when you're poor. I did manage to collect all the individual prizes, including Consuela and her house and her kingpin costume (didn't have her before), not sure how. Guess all that diligent tapping adds up.  I was delayed quite a bit by The Great Tuba and Sulu Tapes Shortages of 2015 or else I would be a lot further. At least I haven't had crashes. I don't know how far I'll get in Week 5, but no worries. I didn't get far in Star Trek since I started when it was more than half over, but enjoyed it anyway. I haven't used any clams (I can't buy them, my entertainment budget is now zero), although if the free clams TV comes back (disappeared in the last update, alas) then I'll definitely be able to buy Mr. Miyagi - not soon enough to help with the event, but I'd like him wandering around my town since I'm a Pat Morita fan from way back.

But in my alt game, in which I hardly got anything for washee, it put me at the same level, so I actually need to only get a few more things, so in this case it benefited me.

familyguythegame,3btboc,Murraymurstein,6,Wed Jul 1 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"We changed up Courier and Gurl Scout drops because the cookies were preventing Tubas, Mr. Sulu's Tapes and other required items. We had set cookies to drop 100% of the time, plus a material, but the way the game calculates drops ended up causing materials to drop much more rarely. We received a huge influx of support requests concerned about material drops from the scouts and couriers, so a change was necessary.  To compensate, we reduced the chance of dropping cookies, while increasing the number of cookies that drop. Over time, the total number of cookies dropped will be the same. We also moved some items, such as Tubas, to character actions instead of squatters.  Future updates will include a fix for material rarity, so we can have a squatter drop event currency every time while allowing for drop rates for materials above 50%.  I hope this helps clarify. We agree that it's not an ideal fix, but this allowed us to address tubas, Mr. Sulu's Tapes, and other material rarities without lowering the total number of cookies earned over time."
familyguythegame,3btboc,Tiny_Matt,10,Wed Jul 1 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not ideal for people like me that have all those materials, but still have a bunch of ""clear 12 couriers"" and etc quests that are giving me useless coins.

familyguythegame,3btboc,SamQuentin,2,Fri Jul 3 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"Nerfing the cookies was 100% unnecessary. Event actions should drop event currency with a 100% drop rate.  Also, increasing the number of cookies that drop, when they drop (which happens to be NEVER, fyi), does not translate into the same number of cookies in the long run. It translates into an extra element of luck where luck should not be involved whatsoever.  Fuck TinyCo and fuck you."
familyguythegame,3bsm70,flux365,2,Wed Jul 1 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"For my list, I try to get the best rep per hour (RPH). For the Fort, 2 sets of data are valid, RPH and an adjusted RPH to add in the 16 hrs for Fort rebuild time (ARPH).   Purple Truck - 1 Wise Guy x 30 minutes = 30 minutes for 5 rep / 10 RPH Gurl Scout - 2 Luchas X 1 hr = 2 hrs for 10 rep / 5 RPH Cookie Courier - 3 Showgirls x 45 mins = 2.25 hrs for 15 rep / 6.66666 RPH Armored Truck - 2 Thugs x 30 minutes = 1 hr for 25 rep / 25 RPH Senior Gurl Scout - 1 of those Gun Goons x 1 hr 30 minutes = 1 & 1/2 hrs for 50 rep / 33.3333 RPH   Fort Nox (assuming a full Fort with 125 HP)   Wise Guy = 10 rep x 25 times = 250 rep for 12.5hrs of hire time / 20 RPH or 8.77 ARPH Lucha = 20 rep x 15 times = 300 rep for 15 hrs of hire time / 20 RPH or 9.677 ARPH Showgirl = 25 rep x 11 times = 275 for 8.25 hrs / 33.3333333 RPH or 11.34 ARPH Thug = 28 rep x 9 times = 252 for 4.5 hrs / 56 RPH or 12.29 ARPH Gun Goon = 30 rep x 9 times = 252 for 13.5 hrs / 18.66666 RPH or 8.54 ARPH.   So.. using those numbers, the most ideal would be using Yakisoba Thugs, use 9 for the fort to grab 252 rep, the 100 bonus rep and spend the next 19.5 hrs hiring them for Armored trucks to get another 475 rep. = 827 rep for a 24 hour period, but you need 47 Nunchucks for this, so this won't be possible for most anyone but whales.  Honestly, the best way would be to use Wise Guys against Cookie Trucks/Fort. Get 350 rep from the fort and you still have 11.5 hrs (25 truck hits) and get 125 rep from that for just cost of cookies. That's 475 for a 24 hour period, but it's more repeatable than Thugs.  edit: This was just thrown together on my break at work, so I hope it's right. I didn't include mansion runs, because I can't go back and re-do them. And I realize that not everyone has the Gun Goons (If that's their name, I dunno) because not everyone has them, but it's totally not worth it to use. They are the worst against the fort but best against their ""wandering obstacle"" but I don't believe it's easy to get the Tommy Guns needed, plus you have to spend 200 Clams to unlock."

The difference was that before you'd see Carl waving at you, and now there is no waving Carl, just the TV in front of the house, with or without a clam bubble.   I don't know why my game is different from everyone else's but I had Carl in the game last year, and the new Mort thing has been around for about six months I think.

Even the free fake money is useless, why would anyone with half a brain pay for it?"
familyguythegame,3bfmza,Rosshk,3,Tue Jun 30 17:25:17 2015 UTC,And why do they constantly have a deal that rewards us if we spend real money on a box of coins? I have well over $5 million coins that aren't getting used anytime soon.

Some days I get as few as 2 clams, a couple times I've had as many as 8 and a typical day is 4-6. It's a strange thing to log in to the game and be excited that the TV is there so I get to watch commercials. The pop up when you click the TV says Free Clams but they're not free. If they were free I wouldn't have to watch commercials to get them. But, the commercials are typically short at 15-30 seconds each, a large majority are game trailers, and I also don't see the same ads very often. These clams do add up over time but when you consider the cost of most clam items they don't have much impact in the short term. I picked up the video arcade that dropped items for mr washee at 120 clams and wiped out about a months worth of these clams. It could easily take 2 months of watching these commercials to even get enough for one of your average premium event characters. Still, it's obviously way better than no extra clams and hopefully everyone gets this feature soon."

From my own experience with freemium games and video ads for ""free"" virtual currency, it seems like it's the advertisers who decide who they target and some people just never get squat for whatever reason.  IMO that creates a pretty ridiculous imbalance, especially when the game involves things like leaderboards or PvP. The developers love to go on about creating a balanced in-game economy, but when some people can get free currency and others are S.O.L., the developer can take that balanced economy line and shove it straight back up where the rest of their shit comes from."

As Mobsters draws to a close, we're looking at how we can improve the Brewery feature for future content. We like that it brings more gameplay to districts, but players have let us know about some key annoyances:   Unable to store the brewery when it's finished. We will be fixing this in an upcoming update, and make the Brewery stashable. Brewery drops conflicting with event drops. in Mobstersm we moved Mort's Dog Food drop to other characters, so that his Brewery drops didn't conflict. Short term, we will be keeping Brewery actions and Event actions separate. Long term, we're working on fixes for drop rarity that will allow a character to have multiple drops at their intended rate.   Is there anything else you'd like us to look at in improving this?"

But not for money. Unless someone is willing to be generous and send funds, I won't be getting him.  I don't have the boxers either. Couldn't afford them.

If you're used to getting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts on your birthday or other holidays, what's a few thousand dollars to blow on a phone game.   We're looking at this through our ""normal"" standards, but there are some pretty rich people in this world, and buying $5000 worth of clams may be nothing to them."

I've dumped in about 18k clams, I'm in the top 1000, and every time I log in and see I'm still not banned I am awestruck as to why I'm still not banned.  And I'm not even a very good cheater, just a standard very well known easy help for clams.  I only have rep from speeding up tasks and buying things outright and raiding and such...which does result in tons of hats spawning so yes it should be obvious to whatever cheating detection algorithm they've put in place. Whatever."
familyguythegame,3ajx7y,famguynoob,4,Sun Jun 21 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"TinyCo employees with perks shouldn't be allowed to be included in the boards. It throws off our chances at getting higher. It's like putting PhD graduates in a primary school challenge but say that the third graders have the same chance to win against university graduates.  So not true. If I end up only 100 away from the next tier prize, it'd be because their employees and friends got the perks to be up there instead of a loyal and paying customer like me and many others.   It really Grinds My Gears that I'm not gonna be able to get Don Corleone simply because I'm competing for a spot in a race, instead of like all the previous events where I could get the top prizes if I just completed everything before the event. And I have. I have King Butt, legitimately. And all the rest (that I wanted). All the Star Trek characters. Etc. I wanted to get them and got them. But even with all the grinding and all, I am nowhere near close enough to getting the Godfather. I may not even get the Stewie skin. (Whoopidy Doo!) but for a mobster event and only a top few (and few because even 10,000 is a few when you can see that there are over a million players) will be able to have him.   Yes this is just a stupid game and not worth any emotional stress over, but the point is, it went from a build your own Quahog and unlock things to a you must earn and still not get the thing to a you must pay, earn, and beat other players, and still not get the thing type of game.  I didn't start and continue to play this game because it is a competitive game, I played/play it because I like Family Guy and wanted to have a Sims experience building my own town and watch the silly characters do silly tasks and open new land and see unlock new buildings and characters. And have some casual fun. Not to set alarms all day and night to log in so I don't miss out on a timed chance at possibly getting something.  It used to be that if you did X, you got Y. Period. Not a chance at Y. Anyway. Done with this rant. Glad there's a place to vent."

I wrote to CS, they gave the same bs answer that they will check it out and ban if cheating but I won't be told blah blah. They're using the clam hack, but hey if they don't care about botters in their game..that's their loss financially. Ethically it bugs me, because it does throw a curve on the top 100, you can only play for individual prizes. I have over 18k  mob rep, which is places me around the top 14k point.

Bullshit, a tie is a tie, I should've been bumped up to qualify for the next place. So I haven't checked and don't really care where I stand.

That way, everyone who gets the same amount of rep as #5000 gets the same prize, rather than shafting 16 people who got the same level as #5000, who equally deserve it. TinyCo will not do this, it makes too much sense."
familyguythegame,3ajx7y,VesperX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:18 2015 UTC,It's more likely that the top spot is a control. A bot that plays the game 24/7 to see what the max possible score without cheats is. It's unlikely that TinyCo would let employees participate in events like this. My wife was banned from the leaderboards for cheating. Granted we did use the hack but minimally and not for mob rank. I used the same tool and I have not been banned yet.
familyguythegame,3ajx7y,frankdrebiin,-1,Sun Jun 21 16:53:05 2015 UTC,(I'm pretty sure) These crazy amounts of mob rep are hacked games and get banned every day.

Either cheaters aren't banned, only non-spending cheaters are banned (meaning if you still pay, cheat and it don't matter), there are shills playing for the purpose of driving up costs, or there are actually some ""whales"" who are spending literally tens of thousands of dollars on a phone app.  Granted, there are probably a few people who are the children of oil barons or something, spending everything on daddy's business platinum card, but it's plain ignorant to assume there are hundreds of those types playing. Especially when every freemium game that exists has the same problem.  Most likely there are a number of shills, and Apple/Google turn a blind eye to the scams because they can claim ignorance while making a ridiculous profit."

Maybe I will just do Fort Nox. And the goons. But I am not progressing on the main quest line or the raids, or Mr.  Washee.   This was so poorly planned out, it's infuriating. Especially when you keep going down on the leader boards only  to be knocked back up 5k spaces every day.   Final rant : this event is so buggy, that when you file a complaint they no longer respond to you. I have had two issues that I have sent messages to them with no response.   I am so frustrated with the game that when I got back from vacation (so I was behind on this event) I used up all my carefully saved clams (ollieland because I am not giving them money) to catch up and to be done with so if I give up, I won't feel bad for leaving all of them sitting around."

And so long as people continue to figuratively throw bags of cash at them for it, the more cuts they are encouraged to make.  Eventually the game will just become a single menu with one button on it... ""Buy now"". Every purchase will result in the sound of Peter Griffin laughing. Pay again for more laughs."

If these damn tubas were listed as what they are, extra rare or epic, I would expect this and think it was completely normal. They're listed as uncommon though, which is either a blatant lie or (more) evidence that at least one person at TinyCo rides to work on the shortest bus in existence."

Then you have to actually hire the luchadors, which takes another hour each (while still trying to get the other thugs for boxing gloves). Then it takes TWO luchadors to drop elbows on the gurl scout cookies. So we're talking 6-7 chances per day, and gaining horns on maybe 25% of those at best. 1-2 horns per day...  Sorry for the wall of text... this stuff sucks."

familyguythegame,3aaz2c,Hillel1963,2,Thu Jun 18 22:00:27 2015 UTC,19 horns and counting.  That's what I have. But it seemed to slow down for me around the 17th one. It took me like 4 rounds of fighting girl scouts to get one more tuba. Then a tuba dropped from the building. In 5 hours I will have a chance of one more tuba drop from the building.  EDIT: Idk why I got downvoted but whatever I guess. I just responded that it is possible to get tubas...

One of the requirements is to take down the optional casino raid once, which I take means the first one AFTER you complete the three stars. I thought I worked my way through those quickly, but I'm still hours from completing the three star-raid... and I have 10 hours to go. The quest is only available to those who at some point purchased a clam package, which I did months and months ago, but it seems to heavilly favor those willing to speed things up by spamming clams.

familyguythegame,39wy2p,b369,0,Mon Jun 15 18:26:59 2015 UTC,"My rank is 10,055. I fluctuate between 15,000 and 11,000. I have spent a few clams here and there rushing for Diabetos but I'm not spending any for Jr. Except for these damn tubas for him, this has been a fairly flowing event.  I'm not buying premium buildings unless I want the building itself. And I've only bought the one for Diabetos.  Didn't even try for the 24 casino challenge. Not worth it. Don't have either of the boxers. Don't care about boxing. And am not even trying for the Cleveland skin.  The only reason I'm going for C Jr. is because he's necessary for the event.  Otherwise I'm not sure why I'm where I am at in the leaderboards. I was around 8,000 at one point but then dropped immediately later in the day to around 25,000.  But I've noticed that a lot of people are within 1 or 2 points and hundreds away. There's hundreds of thousands of players. In my friends list, I have one that flips with me, another way down around 100,000, and 2 others that aren't even on the boards (at zero).  Just playing and logging in as often as possible and putting everyone on tasks that drop mob rep and cookies.   UPDATE Logged in again and am now 31,147.  I have no idea how these leaderboards work."
familyguythegame,39xi03,Oswarez,3,Mon Jun 15 16:34:10 2015 UTC,You need to keep doing the gold-bordered quest lines until it pops up.

familyguythegame,39w06a,defurious,2,Mon Jun 15 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"If you don't have Cleveland and you don't plan on ever having him, getting his costume is pointless.

But I read, that if they would give the opportunity to buy more land, only people with new 2015 devices could play the game, because that would be needed.  So it might not be that simple.  That being said, I played the game for a couple of weeks and the land I could afford so far is packed, so that I had to store something, too. I thought that would thin out, while I cleare more districts, lol."

That definitely takes a load on your device. Family Guy hasn't even come close to the amount of land that TSTO has. Sure giving us more land on FGTQFS could break it for some users but as of now that's highly unlikely. It more has to do with TinyCo's 'we don't give a fuck about you' attitude, because they don't... except for our money."

familyguythegame,39pjy5,-dudeman,9,Sat Jun 13 18:40:36 2015 UTC,It takes a special kind of individual to be willing to pay for a free game that offers zero additional value per dollar spent. This is just proof of that.
familyguythegame,39pjy5,-dudeman,-5,Sat Jun 13 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"I paid for it because I liked the game at first. I paid like 2 dollars each time. Then this event came around and I was like ""HEEEY AWESOME!"" So I wanted to support TinyCo, but then I was banned. So, fuck that."

familyguythegame,39pjy5,famguynoob,5,Sat Jun 13 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"The main irritation is that after it crashes, you lose some or all of the things you just did. So you always have to keep going back to check that that 8 hour task you were supposed to start actually started. I got pretty irritated when all my overnight tasks somehow never got started and I woke up to everyone just milling around.   Now I have to go back ""one last time"" to make sure everything is really in order before quitting."

Am considering freeclamming again but really thing like this have shown THE ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO QUIT.  Gonna do a fresh reset of my device anyway and will just not reinstall this thing.  When Mike Tyson showed up that was pretty cool and I immediately grabbed him and realized that was the only joy i've gotten from this game in recent memory.

I saw something in game that said Mike Tyson, Bonnie, and Cleveland Jr. (With a pic of Diabeto, making that clear as mud) all drop masks. I'm not paying clams for Mike Tyson, you need Luchadors to defeat Gurl Scouts to even unlock Cleveland Jr., and Bonnie's task is locked because the building required for that task is locked.

If he is not completely unlocked, he will disappear from the game at that time.

familyguythegame,39mz7s,Casualty466,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:53:32 2015 UTC,I finally had a gold truck last night and these things now have a spot in the in-game FAQ. One gold truck will appear each day and stick around for 4 hours. So you need to clear 25 days worth of gold trucks to get the Cleveland skin which is just the skin and doesn't include the character.
familyguythegame,39mz7s,-dudeman,0,Sat Jun 13 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I'm pretty much assuming that's because I haven't upgraded the mansion yet... And I can't do that because dog food is apparently more uncommon than Jamaican leprechauns or rainbow coloured goddam unicorns."

Needing both tacos and dog food (to get past the chihuahuas in order to earn more Mexican candies) to have any shot at getting Diabeto before he's gone tomorrow, they all would have to start dropping more often than 'common' items.  Good thing nobody is forcing me to spend and I have enough self control not to, otherwise this would be borderline extortion."

familyguythegame,398nkg,PunkThug,3,Wed Jun 10 01:28:54 2015 UTC,"There are only two ways to have any actual control in a leaderboard event. The first is to spend until desired result is achieved, the second is to not care and just take what you get.  The worthlessness of pretty much everything offered makes not caring very easy. As for the skin and character, let me remind anyone who cares what happens to event stuff once an event is over. It's rarely, if ever, used again. And don't forget you won't get any of these prizes until the end of the event. They will be worthless the instant you receive them."
familyguythegame,398nkg,-dudeman,-1,Wed Jun 10 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"Spending and stopping might not work.  Say on make it where you want and the event has 10 days left.  Enough people pass you during that time, you could be dropped back down a rank and miss what you were aiming for.  As for the 'worthless-ness'  I don't see it that way.  Tiny Co doesn't allow tons of characters have quest related stuff to keep the game from becoming unbalanced towards players who have been at it longer (How well they do that is a matter for debate)  I enjoy my guys from Star Trek; Borg kitten makes me smile every time!  Everyone else gets 24 hour quests for extra $$$/exp, and (if thats too uch trouble for you) there is always storage"
familyguythegame,398nkg,-dudeman,3,Wed Jun 10 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"I never said spend and then stop. I said spend until desired result is achieved, and no result at all is achieved until the event is over. The only way to spend and then stop and still achieve the desired result is to way overspend... But that's pretty far from being most people's desire.  Value is debatable, I mean, whatever floats yer* boat, right? As far as actual worth though, regardless of the reason, nothing you buy today is of much use ever again. Putting any character on a non-quest task for useless coins and meaningless XP isn't an issue of trouble, it's more that doing it or not makes no difference. As in, do it, or don't do it, either way it has neither a positive nor negative effect on anything."
familyguythegame,398nkg,deadwrongallalong,2,Wed Jun 10 03:51:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this leaderboard thing is pretty stupid. I was originally under the impression that every player would get every prize they qualified for. Wtf is the point if you only get one prize and have a minimal amount of control over your rank and therefore which prize you get?? This could've been a good thing but TinyCo ruined it"
familyguythegame,398nkg,blackgryphon9999,0,Wed Jun 10 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was shocked when I saw this.

familyguythegame,398nkg,-dudeman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"It's also near to impossible to judge where you really stand. As far as I can tell, the leaderboard is updated only once a day.

familyguythegame,398nkg,MrMaku,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"I will definitely be taking a screenshot of my rank as close to the end of the event as possible. That way when TinyBrains updates the leaderboard at the same time they end the event and give out the wrong prizes I will have evidence of the prize I should have received.  This is probably their first try at anything involving a leaderboard, they probably haven't tested it properly, and as a result they obviously suck at it."

familyguythegame,395pdh,Zomboy716,3,Tue Jun 9 15:04:41 2015 UTC,Thanks. I can't open the in game FAQ. It says 'star trek event' and 'no questions found'. More people with this issue?
familyguythegame,395pdh,deadwrongallalong,-1,Tue Jun 9 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Its a skin. However, the last time they had a skin for Consuela (Halloween event via a mystery box), they did put her on sale to some degree. So perhaps that will happen again near the end of the event? I'm just speculating, but it would make sense"
familyguythegame,395pdh,-dudeman,-2,Tue Jun 9 13:40:05 2015 UTC,Good to see some people are actually checking the in-game FAQ. It does say we get the character and the skin... Which suggests it will be either extremely time consuming or require clams to earn that much mob rep.
familyguythegame,395pdh,SailorET,2,Tue Jun 9 15:58:28 2015 UTC,"You need 17,000 mob rep."
familyguythegame,395pdh,-dudeman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"17,500 actually. Which is exactly why it will require a significant amount of time dedication, if it's even possible to earn that much mob rep for free, or clams.  Doing some quick math, the event has been live for about 4 days and I've earned roughly 1,360 mob rep without spending clams. That amounts to 340/day. There are 30 days left, so if my rate of earning mob rep continues that's a possible 340 x 30 = 10,200 mob rep without clams before the event ends. That would leave me 6,000 mob rep short, so I would have to start waking up in the middle of the night and setting alarms throughout the day to even have a chance at earning 17,500 mob rep for free, if it's even possible. It may not be, which would mean clams are required regarless of how hardcore you get."
familyguythegame,395pdh,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,3,Tue Jun 9 20:32:06 2015 UTC,You'd probably have to spend some clams on one of those premium cookie making buildings.

familyguythegame,395pdh,-dudeman,0,Wed Jun 10 21:58:06 2015 UTC,"I hope that people won't get the regular Consuela skin for free then. So basically, give them Kingpin Consuela as a character, but if they want to use 'cleaning' Consuela as a skin they'll have to pay for it."
familyguythegame,395pdh,Namrepus221,0,Tue Jun 9 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"Based on the math I posted above, the Consuela prize could actually end up costing more clams than just the regular character. So 1) there's no reason to have two separate Consuela's wandering around, and 2) if you pay more to have the Kingpin Consuela than it costs to have the regular version there is no legitimate reason why you shouldn't get both."
familyguythegame,395pdh,Mewkipz,0,Tue Jun 9 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Not 2 seperate ones. It's the same character, just don't have people have access to her 'regular' skin unless they bought it."

I also feel like a fool buying Guinan/Worf/Q/Spock/Khan at this point. So TinyCo is going to have to try really hard if they want Clams from me lately. The only Clams I've had since Star Trek ended was for completing in-game collections. I'm a new player, started right after Star Trek began.

But yeah, I'm with you, I was surprised Vinny had no actions, I mean, come on..."
familyguythegame,38upqu,kjhwkejhkhdsfkjhsdkf,3,Sun Jun 7 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sick and tired of having all these characters/skins that do nothing. Especially the ones from previous events, I am now stuck with 2 Patrick Stewarts which could have easily been skins."

Really, I'm not sure why they keep them around if they're not going to do anything with them.  Besides, Vinny being used for a mobster feature? That just makes way too much sense to happen."
familyguythegame,38upqu,whoopsydaisie,2,Sun Jun 7 00:53:42 2015 UTC,Once I missed out on a day or so of gathering stuff because some characters that dropped items were in storage. Now I take hella time looking through stored characters every event. A drop list in the event info page would be really useful.
familyguythegame,38upqu,-dudeman,0,Sun Jun 7 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"Curious? Not really. He isn't new and TinyCo hates reusing old characters. Normally that seems like a decision based only on money/clams, but this event has a leaderboard so it seems like more of a fairness thing this time."
familyguythegame,38upqu,Necrofamicom,2,Sun Jun 7 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"I was hoping the leaderboard would be an excuse to let us use all the characters we've earned in the past, or at least ones like Vinnie who are from the main game at later levels."
familyguythegame,38upqu,-dudeman,4,Sun Jun 7 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be very fair for new players, and games like this rely on new players. They are the ones who are more likely to spend since they haven't had as much time to learn how poor of a decision that is. If anything, the leaderboard would be the exact reason why older characters and characters unlocked later are not used."
familyguythegame,38upqu,Necrofamicom,4,Sun Jun 7 00:58:06 2015 UTC,That does seem to be the way they're looking at it. But it does feel slightly alienating to those of us with 83 characters and 70 of them in storage.
familyguythegame,38upqu,-dudeman,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"True, but people in that position have probably spent what they are going to spend. If spending a little created a permanent advantage for something involving a leaderboard, a new player would have zero incentive to participate. Not sure about anyone else, but if I start playing a game and immediately find out I am at a permanent disadvantage, I'm not going to continue playing let alone spend any real money on it."
familyguythegame,38upqu,Necrofamicom,2,Sun Jun 7 01:09:36 2015 UTC,"I guess it bears mentioning that we do generally get tasks for characters that unlock later in the game in the later stages of events. Like Stewie and Meg had something to do in the Star Trek event near the end.  It would still be nice if at least some of the characters had something to do, though. Like, figure out the drop rates as they are now, and add a task with a random previous event or premium character. They do need to incentivize long time players in some way."
familyguythegame,38upqu,-dudeman,6,Sun Jun 7 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"From a business perspective, it's actually better if the long term players quit entirely. If everyone who starts playing continues/never quits, eventually the server space runs out. Combined with the fact that most of the long term players spend little or nothing, it doesn't financially make sense to accomodate to them.  I'm sure this will get downvoted, and I don't like it any more than anyone else, but facts is facts. Freemium game developers are businesses whose sole intention is to make profit. Investing in keeping non-spenders happy, or even light spenders, makes no sense. Especially when they can rely so heavily on new players who will spend before they learn what little value they get in return and on whales who are rich and just don't care."
familyguythegame,38upqu,Necrofamicom,2,Sun Jun 7 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"The whales are the ones you want to keep around, though, and those are the ones who are likely to have, say, Cleveland or the Comicon premium characters. I've bought all the premium characters because I'm a crazy person, so it would be nice to get some use out of them.  Although you're right,I'm sure they have reams of data on spending habits and playing habits and optimize towards that."
familyguythegame,38upqu,-dudeman,2,Sun Jun 7 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"The thing about whales is they spend at that level because a few thousand bucks is literally meaningless to them. They don't care what future use there is for anything, and they don't care what it costs to have everything. They will stick around regardless of what happens and if one leaves, usually for every one there is at least one that replaces them.  I've said it before and I can say it again, it's because of people who throw money without actually caring about the value provided that those of us who would like to see improvements become frustrated. Developer earns cash hand over fist and has no reason to change or provide value."

familyguythegame,38tu29,mrjocco,5,Mon Jun 8 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"The in-game FAQ says cheaters are/can be/will be banned from the leaderboard. TinyCo obviously has anti-cheating measures in place already, so probably only the most clever of cheaters will have access to the leaderboard."
familyguythegame,38tu29,-dudeman,3,Sat Jun 6 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"The in-game FAQ also says everyone gets a randomly assigned ""silly"" name for the leaderboard to protect anonymity. Hardly a ""public display of violators"".  I'm pretty sure the vast majority of names that will appear on the leaderboard will be legit players. What will be really interesting is seeing what the whales score."
familyguythegame,38tu29,-dudeman,2,Sun Jun 7 02:28:23 2015 UTC,"The only game left in this game is how much you can cheat and still get away with it.  Now you are competing against blatant cheaters, whales, stealthy cheaters, and legit hardcore players. GLWT"
familyguythegame,38tu29,famguynoob,3,Tue Jun 9 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, lots of thoughts. I also play a game called Megapolis, which has PvP contests. Players who stick by the rules (both premium and freemium) have absolutely no chance against the cheaters. I don't even bother to play the contests because I know I can't possibly win anything. To earn a prize you must either spend a LOT of real money or cheat like crazy, neither of which I care to do.  So...when I saw the PvP part of this event, it seemed pretty clear to my cynical self that anyone who played legally or wasn't prepared to spend tons of money couldn't even make it into the top million. <shrug> There will always be people with deep pockets who buy their way to the top; it will be next to impossible to tell them from the cheaters, I should think."
familyguythegame,38tu29,blackgryphon9999,-6,Sat Jun 6 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I hope they catch them. I have spent money on the game before, and thieves should be caught and brought to justice for those of us who are honest."

Not only is it dishonest and hurting the people who actually create the game, but it is cheating the hpnest players as well. You don't feel like the cheaters/liars should be brought to justice? Sounds like the words of a guilty person to me..."
familyguythegame,38tu29,scrantonfan,2,Mon Jun 8 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"You appear to have completely missed the point of that question. Prior to this leaderboard event, in what way do anyone else's activities, legit or not, affect your game experience? This isn't technically a multiplayer game and prior to this leaderboard event you haven't really been in direct competition with anyone.  At worst, cheaters cause TinyCo to increase the cost of premium content (as if that will have any effect on anything). End result is the whales, for whom money is no object, continue to fund the game and others simply play for free. Is playing a free game for free really that upsetting?"

Games run crappy when the system they are played on has been on for a long time, especially portable ones like phones. It has something to do with a build up of trash in the systems memory I think. Seriously, try it. The worst that happens is your tablet or phone or whatever is off for a minute or two.  Of course this sorry excuse of a 'game' is shitty, we all know that.

I shouldn't have to restart my phone every time I want to play this game.  All other games work fine.    But I'm curious if it's because of the size of my town.  It's not totally full but I have all of the land unlocked.  I put a lot of decorations and characters in storage but that didn't seem to do anything.  I don't really want to put my buildings in there too since they generate income, but I will if anyone can verify that it works."

Either way, if force closing your game doesn't work, you could try a clean install before you give up and wait for the next update.

I stopped playing not that long after the clam crackdown last time.   After reading this I logged onto the game and I too got the message and clams reduced. Have no idea how many I had  , no idea where I was in the game, but I'm pretty sure I never cheated a second time; simply because I never bothered playing the game with any consistency.  So it looks like your clams were taken because you cheated  once. Which is fair enough, although it would be better for TinyCo to just say that they'll continually take back clams from anyone who has ever got free clams."

It's always odd to me when people always assume something is called a game and therefore has to have an end or win point. It is a build-your-own-town app. Like the old Sim City, or The Sims. There's no end to those ""games"". It is a simulation. Although, one could argue that since it is subtitled ""the quest for stuff"" you'd be a winner by making sure that you have collected ALL the stuff and have all your characters to MAX XP levels etc. but there is no end point nor a win/lose moment.  It's a at your own pace kind of game.  Like Minecraft or playing with Legos. Build it as you go, watch the characters do funny tasks and enjoy the quests they go on and the dialogue they have. But if you aren't one who likes casual build and create games, then don't play this one and move on to Halo or Skyrim or something."

The only reason anyone would want an option to cancel actions is if they often find themselves wishing they hadn't sent a character on task in the first place. Key word there being ""often"".  Well, if it's so ""often"", use your brain and learn from the mistake instead of repeating it over and over. Don't send characters on super long tasks unless it's for a quest. Otherwise, don't send them on task at all, or if you must, make it a short one.  Of all the things TinyCo rightfully gets blamed for doing wrong, this should not even be close to making the list.

familyguythegame,37o3v2,Raumz,2,Fri May 29 02:03:37 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're being down voted when you're right
familyguythegame,37o3v2,derickjthompson,5,Fri May 29 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"It's the sad, unfortunate nature of this sub. People have every right to complain about the shady tactics TinyCo employs but the moment someone does, all the apologists seem to come out of the wood works with the down vote brigade."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,halo_nothing,5,Fri May 29 15:07:04 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a list of the characters that can earn pinecones?
familyguythegame,37o3v2,blackgryphon9999,7,Fri May 29 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"Bruce, Mort, and Quagmire each have a 4 hour task."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,blackgryphon9999,5,Fri May 29 03:33:27 2015 UTC,Thank you. That's not very many...
familyguythegame,37o3v2,Fintara,4,Fri May 29 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"I saw it listed as an ""always"" drop though, so it may not be that bad."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,Necrofamicom,2,Fri May 29 06:21:27 2015 UTC,"I did the math. You need 23 items to unlock the S&M cow, because everything except the ball gags drop more than one at a time. If you stay on top of it, you'll get about 12 pine cones a day. With seven days to unlock the cow, that's about 84 chances, so you can get Maple Leaves 60 times and still unlock him without spending clams."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,-dudeman,2,Fri May 29 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"Once you finish an item, hay bales for example, they remain on the prize list. Just now I got 2x hay bales on 2 out of 3 mystery box opens and I don't need them. I suspect that will affect your math somewhat.  Really uncalled for that items which have become literally and completely without purpose are left as prizes from the mystery box."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,Necrofamicom,1 point,Fri May 29 15:56:09 2015 UTC,I noticed that. I think it's a bug. They disappear from the listing of items in the box. For the moment I'm going to just stockpile my pine cones to see what happens.
familyguythegame,37o3v2,-dudeman,1 point,Fri May 29 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"They haven't disappeared from anywhere in my game. Still listed as a prize, still dropping from the box.

familyguythegame,37o3v2,-dudeman,1 point,Fri May 29 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"Nothing is different for me yet, but if it's been changed and I haven't seen it it's probably just being rolled out and not everyone gets the change at the exact same moment.  Nice that it's been changed, but I really doubt there will be any compensation for wasted pine cones. With significant screw ups every single event, you'd think TinyCo would shit-can whichever inept idiots are responsible. A good starting point would be their QA department, as they obviously don't care one bit about actually assuring quality."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,jamnut,2,Fri May 29 19:28:02 2015 UTC,Any way of finding out how many maple leaves you have?
familyguythegame,37o3v2,-dudeman,1 point,Fri May 29 10:53:00 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like it, but if you try placing an item you can't afford there's a notice telling you how many maple ""leafs"" you still need. Once you know how many you need it's just basic subtraction (cost of item minus number required) to figure out how many you have."
familyguythegame,37o3v2,Mewkipz,2,Fri May 29 12:04:29 2015 UTC,Whoa! Irrelevant to Nature but it seems they have added 2 new characters in the Characters Tab in the store!

If you're spending clams to achieve everything you are spending every possible spare second you at all hours of the day in hopes it will be enough even though realistically if you do make it it's still by a hair. No thanks.

familyguythegame,37o3v2,zapuda,-1,Sat May 30 18:46:47 2015 UTC,What's the point of earning stuff just to store it inventory?  Why don't they actually give land and focus on districts instead of stupid mini events filled with worthless stuff that's going to be shoved into the inventory anyway?    What you're saying is the dumbest argument ever.  Just store the stuff....then why have it if its stored?
familyguythegame,37o3v2,-dudeman,1 point,Sat May 30 20:41:59 2015 UTC,"The point of earning stuff is to have a reason to play. It's the whole point of the game, hence the title ""the quest for stuff"". What you do with that stuff is up to you, but notice how the title of the game is not ""the quest for endless hoarding of stuff"". Get stuff, most of which is useless the instant you get it, and then either design a town that is pleasing to look at or store it in inventory because it's completely useless anyways."

familyguythegame,37f3v8,DeloreanFanatic,8,Fri May 29 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"I unlocked Seamus and quit. The game locks up every time I try to do any missions/train firefighters, or I'll manage to complete tasks and exit, only to come back an hour later and the actions didn't ""stick"". This was happening during the Star Trek event as well.  Only about 36 hours until it's over and we can stop playing until the next event and complain again :)"

familyguythegame,37f3v8,nikapo,3,Wed May 27 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"I think this event was much worse than the bird one, due to the method of collecting items. Having to collect this one item, so you can collect this other one, so you can collect this other one, was just extremely tedious, and expected you to sit at your phone all day in order to train firefighters in order to earn everything in time.  I quit trying after earning Chris' costume; it was downright ridiculous how much they were pushing the clam-spending in this thing."
familyguythegame,37f3v8,Sea-Salt,2,Thu May 28 11:41:51 2015 UTC,"You even had to spend clams to unlock firepoles, that was one of the most ridicoulous aspects besides Brians costume."
familyguythegame,37f3v8,-dudeman,5,Thu May 28 12:13:30 2015 UTC,"I sent TinyCo a ticket that said, ""this event sucks ass, is there a way to disable it so I won't have to look at it?""  They actually replied, saying they were sorry I wasn't enjoying the event and hoped the next one would be more up my ""ally"". They then thanked me for ""stinking around"".  Can't tell if the typos were intentional, or maybe accidentally on purpose, but I'm not even mad. The reply I got, typos included, was the best thing that came from the event."
familyguythegame,37f3v8,Hillel1963,3,Wed May 27 13:59:52 2015 UTC,Worst. Event. Ever.  And fuck TinyCo for the shit they pulled with Brian
familyguythegame,37f3v8,dmgb06,2,Thu May 28 23:02:33 2015 UTC,This has been my least favorite event. I've been playing since the NYE event and have found reason to appreciate some aspect of each event.  This one... None. Up until this event I checked religiously to get as many items as possible without paying.  Now I am down to once a day... Maybe. I am focusing my characters and time on finishing Pawtucket Pat and not this event.  I hate that the fires and creatures are gunking up my town.
familyguythegame,37f3v8,Laura__Spagora,2,Wed May 27 12:52:28 2015 UTC,Yep. this event is the worst. I haven't been doing any of it at all.

You won't get the entire quest line because it'll all go bye-bye after today.   I fell for their scam on the last day of Bird Peter. Spent 30 clams to finish the skin. Event ended. I got the skin, but the quests disappeared. I asked them why I couldn't continue the questline that I thought I was purchasing with the Bird Peter skin and they responded that Nature Week and everything that went with it had ended. I told them that they're running a scam and I'm never spending real money on their crap game again.  In Simpsons: TO, you get the full questline whenever you get a new costume. Why can't TinyCo follow suit? Oh, right. Because they're asshole scam artists. You know it's bad when you outshit EA."

familyguythegame,37f3v8,Phinbart,0,Wed May 27 05:16:58 2015 UTC,"I've only played Family Guy QFS since December when the Xmas event was only a few hours short of ending. I've only been around for a few events, and at the beginning, this event seemed promising, me thinking ""Oooh, nice way to spend time before the big June event"" after blowing around one third of my clams on Bird Beard Peter and this mini-event really has been crap. Why they couldn't have allowed us to collect resources for Firefighter Seamus from the beginning and perhaps created a more expansive, and more hilarious storyline involving Peter and the gang joining the firefighters rather than focus on fatuous quests involving Chris and Seamus. To be disappointed is not what we want after wasting nearly two weeks collecting resources to get the costumes only to find the questlines are as boring as (I can't cuss here, so...). Trying to get the Jaws of Life Mystery Box has been an absolute pain. Hopefully TinyCo will bring something more exciting to the pile after two disastrous events which has had over the past two months US iPhone player numbers fall to 300k, half or a third of Tapped Out's."

familyguythegame,36ep8d,chejrw,2,Mon May 18 20:29:44 2015 UTC,No. I did it the opposite way and unlocked the 3rd pole first so Firefighter Chris was the last of the Axes for me. They probably stop giving Axes after you have no more uses for the Axes. I would go for the 3rd pole first anyway because the extra spot will help you get to your goals faster.

familyguythegame,36ep8d,VesperX,2,Mon May 18 23:38:31 2015 UTC,didnt want to start my own thread for such a small tip but sometimes the characters stop on the same spots as the fires making it difficult to click them. Instead clink above the fire on the smoke. about a quarter of the way down seems to be the easiest for me. also a good way to click fires hiding behind buildings.
familyguythegame,36ep8d,-dudeman,1 point,Fri May 22 02:16:44 2015 UTC,"So far I have had no need for the third pole. Once I unlocked Chris the only things left to do are the pointless quests and train firefighters to clear housefires and earn gas cans, so I can train fire captains and earn axes, so I can unlock the third pole, so I can train more firefighters, and so on.  Everything else looks to either be unavailable yet or locked behind paywall. Since this game isn't worth actual money, after unlocking Chris' costume the ""fun"" is pretty much over.  Back to doing nothing until the next event."
familyguythegame,36ep8d,-dudeman,1 point,Tue May 19 01:10:20 2015 UTC,Well the third pole doesn't cost money so might as well unlock it in preparation for the next part

familyguythegame,3657xx,SansaKillsHodor,2,Sat May 16 06:47:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I do have some suggestions from my own experiences. 1. Try force closing your game. You do that from Settings -> Apps -> Find the game -> Force stop. Try starting the game again as usual. 2. If you have connected your game to Facebook or your Google Account, try uninstalling your game and do a fresh install. This is more likely to help, but always try force closing the game before you uninstall and do a clean install of the app again. If nothing else, you'll get rid of a lot of old code that won't ever be needed again, as well as save a lot of space if you've played for a long time.  I'm guessing the ""Jaws"" your game is trying to find is the ones needed for one of Rupert's two mystery boxes, but we don't have a way of getting them yet. I suppose it might involve a purple beast of some kind, maybe a purple fire monster.  https://familyguyaddicts.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/jaws-of-life.png"

familyguythegame,360i8g,chejrw,4,Fri May 15 01:41:51 2015 UTC,Similar situation here.  At the last moment i bought a bird at 15C and finished the costume.  It was built instantly (no al's or anything) and I sent bird beard on the first task in his quest.  I exited the game.  When i returned Peter was in my inventory and the costume is not available.  No quests in my task list.  Hopefully TinyCo will be willing to remedy the situation.    Edited for grammar.

I think I've had that happen before - do a few tasks, close the game, come back later, and everything is back to the way it was before.    I could be wrong, but I'm almost certain it was because of a weak wi-fi signal; the quests and stuff were done locally, but didn't make it to the server, and thus were reset when I reconnected.  Also not 100% sure this works, but I sometimes click on the ""other"" Quahog to try and make sure everything gets saved (I figure it has to talk to the server to do that)."

I unlocked the costume and the quests stayed up for about 45 minutes after the supposed expiration of Nature Week, but both quests were gone about 15 minutes later when I checked to finish quest-related tasks. As of now, both quest lines are still gone/missing.  I can't say I'm surprised if it's a glitch, or if TinyCo said one thing and proceeded to do exactly the opposite of what they said they would do. Probably the only thing TinyCo could do at this point that would actually surprise me would be to post a video of their entire team shitting out rainbow coloured flying hippos."

familyguythegame,35vs43,Vlad290,2,Thu May 14 01:12:55 2015 UTC,I actually got the skin last night and didn't use a single clam.  You really needed to be on the action completions as soon as they finished.  You also needed to make sure you prioritized the blue and pink birds first and then the green and yellow.  It also helps If you had every action available required to unlock the birds (IE all 3 pink and blue all 4 green and the 5+ for yellow)

I did write to them yesterday saying the event would be made easier if the drop rates would be increased, or if more characters could drop items, but they just said the randomness was part of the ""fun"", drop rates were functioning as planned, and none of the drops are ultra rare.

Since then, I don't bother trying to post. I'm not willing to kiss her ass.

familyguythegame,35p1m8,Dirk_8,2,Tue May 12 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"These timed events are intended to keep you opening up the game as much as possible, it's typical F2P strategy that has gotten a lot worse with the push for constant events that I'm seeing in all the F2P games I play the past few months. The idea is the more you play the more inclined you will be to pay. If they don't give you a reason to play constantly there's the chance you will find something else to do with your time and your money, they don't want that.  I saw your last comment over there and thought you must be new too, timed events for skins and characters aren't new there's just a lot more of them lately.  You want to earn everything for free and in your own time? That'd be awesome but it's not going to happen, welcome to the F2P business model they all use. You get the fixed stuff for free (Districts in this case) and then have to work your ass off and/or pay money for the rest. Limited stuff works with the idea that they're hoping you want it that much you'll put silly amounts of time into it or preferably, actually drop some money.  The Addicts site has repeatedly said they will not post spoilers in case it doesn't go live, then they'd have to deal with the shitstorm from people saying they lied, why did they post wrong info and whatever else people can come up with, which has happened in the past. Sites actually go through the game files to get that info.  They ""sold out"", lol. Do you remember the Spanish Peter fiasco? Guess who got that changed, along with several other drop rates and event extensions. You must have missed the time that, Alissa (the other owner of the site) went off at TinyCo for one of their bs, near-impossible events.  You say ""allegedly"" to avoid lawsuits, slander and defamation are taken quite seriously in the USA.  I'm fighting really hard against the urge to post something about butt hurt and ass cream. Good luck in the real world with that level of sensitivity, you're in for a rough time.  Edit: Forgot to add, I'm about done with the game after that Star Trek nonsense, so don't assume I'm some kind of apologist for anything, I got hit with an XP bug during the event that no one took seriously but it screwed me over big time, now I'm way behind on this bird dropping piece of crap event too."

I don't need more coins either, so if I want to keep characters out the way I send them on short indoor tasks and just don't collect the rent/finish the task. They'll all hit max level eventually, and if I stop playing before that it doesn't matter what level anything is anyways."

Some of the things I hate the most is how they build roads. I haven't had more than a small square of road since the Comic Con-event, and it's so annoying to not be able to put the road where I want because the asphalt is on some dumbass grid that doesn't play well with buildings."

Based on what I know about tribbles, which comes entirely from this Family Guy event, that doesn't surprise me...

I'm not sure about Android app stores, but the Apple AppStore provides refunds on a ""no questions asked"" basis providing you have not abused that generosity.

familyguythegame,34bwp7,Posted_Up,3,Wed Apr 29 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"Haven't purchased any clams and only had to spend a small amount of my existing clams at the tail end of Borg Bertram Battles in order to beat the 24hr timer, I'm about 2 days away from getting Captain Kirk so can't complain about the extension.. it was going to be a really close call."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,Rich73,3,Wed Apr 29 23:24:19 2015 UTC,"I get what those of you annoyed with the extension are saying, but the players have been whining about an extension for a while already, both here and especially on facebook. They're just doing exactly what the players wanted from them, so how does that make this a dick move on their behalf? That, I don't understand!"
familyguythegame,34bwp7,VyseNice,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Apparently they are dicks for making the event too short, AND they are dicks for extending it per the many requests. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.  Was it intentional? Maybe, but that would mean that the glitches and outages that prompted extension requests were all fabricated.   It's also worth noting that this is a licensed event. They likely had a contract to use Star Trek for the time specified, and any extension would require a negotiation and possibly payment to Paramount to extend the event."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,Pleakley,0,Wed Apr 29 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"Because they have other options. They could give clams or event related content to those who experienced technical issues. They could give a small gift of clams to everyone in the game. Or, they could do what they did and extend the event, after baiting people into spending unnecessarily due to the impression that the event was nearly over.  If they had announced an extension a week or two earlier, everything would be fine. But what they ended up doing was baiting people into desperation spending thinking the event was going to end soon, and then switching he expiration date to a week later.  I don't care how you choose to look at it, bait and switch in any business is a complete dick move."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,-dudeman,2,Thu Apr 30 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I'm a huge Star Trek fan, but I am sooooo ready for this to be done. I've just about finished the quests and to be honest, don't really care whether I do. <shrug>"
familyguythegame,34bwp7,blackgryphon9999,2,Fri May 1 11:21:02 2015 UTC,NOOOO!  This Star Trek event has been ridiculous and made me go from checking the game 10 times a day to avoiding it until this over the top event has ended.  I was really looking forward to claim back to it and hoping for a new district.
familyguythegame,34bwp7,zapuda,3,Tue May 5 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was locked out of the game from last Thursday to yesterday when they put out the new iOS update, and considering that I haven't made significant progress and am not even a star Trek Fan I was kinda glad that there would be something new once I got to play again."

familyguythegame,34bwp7,halo_nothing,-8,Thu Apr 30 20:22:49 2015 UTC,"I believe the term you are searching for is ""bait and switch."" And this extension is a perfect example. Bait the paying customers into the belief that they have mere hours left to obtain the objects of their desire, stuff your pockets with the resulting rain of desperation spending, and then switch the expiration date of the event, allowing the process to be repeated in a week's time."

I would have missed out on Kirk otherwise (granted, only by a few hours and only because I refuse to check the game every 4 hours even through the night). Now I have everyone (including joe) and in 30 min I'll have enough dark matter to get the bonus character girl.   The only thing that's bothering me is this: why do I care to get them? They'll all be useless characters earning me even more unnecessary coins as soon as the event is over. At this point it's getting very tedious to go through the town a couple times per day and click every single building and character. Then send on new tasks.. All for coins I don't need anymore. And I've only been playing since December.."

I just need a few more blueprints to unlock Stewie, and I already have his Tulosian costume unlocked and ready to create so I'll be able to do the missions he's needed for. And I just unlocked Picard today, so I'll be able to complete whatever I needed Picard for.  I still don't think there's a hope in hell of me unlocking Joe's costume though, or Kirk. Too much Dark Matter is needed"
familyguythegame,34bwp7,MetalHeadCrow,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"Stewie and Picard will both help you fight Borg Bertram. If you already have Klingon Chris and Geordie, and you are willing to be vigilant in checking your game almost every 4 hours, Kirk is as good as yours. A week is more than long enough to beat him enough times to get the Dark Matter you need. You might even have time to get Pike Joe too, depending how much you actually feel like trying."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,-dudeman,0,Thu Apr 30 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"That is true, I forgot Stewie does help fight. I'll see how things go. Pike Joe I'm not so interested in, but Kirk I very much am so I might just put all my focus on that. I'm all for getting more characters."

Did they even offer us anything for completing all of the quests? I seem to remember completing the main storyline has offered gifts previously, but as this event has been highly inconsistent in quality, I'm guessing completing the final part will yield... like 15 dilithium or something like that."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,VyseNice,1 point,Mon May 4 07:12:58 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering this as well. I'm currently on ""The Final Frontier, Part 4"", which seems like it's going to be the last quest chain. I agree, though, based on what I've seen so far (and the fact that nobody's been bragging about neat rewards for finishing) that it's going to just be a paltry amount of dilithium and SF XP for finishing."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,yoshemitzu,2,Wed May 6 21:05:24 2015 UTC,Just completed it. There's nothing to be gained from completing the main questline at all. All that's left now is to see if I can get enough free clams to maybe purchase a premium character next event.
familyguythegame,34bwp7,VyseNice,0,Thu Apr 30 00:52:56 2015 UTC,"Not complaining, but a whole week extension seems rather long.  Edit: Why the hell am I being downvoted just for giving my opinion? It's not even a complaint... average age on this subreddit must be very low."
familyguythegame,34bwp7,halo_nothing,2,Thu Apr 30 03:01:15 2015 UTC,It is unfortunately the very sad nature of this sub and the TinyCo apologists.
familyguythegame,34bwp7,-dudeman,-1,Thu Apr 30 03:36:21 2015 UTC,This has been an entire event of missed deadlines. They could have extended it by two days and it still would have ended up being a whole week.

familyguythegame,347yfx,koteuop,2,Wed Apr 29 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"I have all the freebie characters in the event, save for Kirk. I worked very hard over the past few weeks to get everything unlocked and collected. Data took the longest, just unlocked Talosian Stewie today as well. But, Kirk, at this point, is just a pipe dream.   To me, this is kind of a slap in the face for the ones who really played the game every 2-4 hours over the past 4 weeks to not be able to get the last free character because they wanted to have people spend 35k in Dilithium in less than 2 weeks just to unlock the last 2 characters and 3 skins when, at least until Warp Core level 6 came out, there was no good way to get more than a few thousand in Dilithium per day. I estimate I will be around 8k short of Kirk by this time tomorrow, and that's really disheartening. I bought Clams for the first time ever in this event, which helped a little getting the regular characters, the real barrier is the Dilitium, which none of those characters really contribute to getting. I would have had to have some sort of foresight and bought a Dilithium Mine a few weeks back to hope to have enough by the end. 700 Clams though? Nothing is worth that, especially something that will be useless on Thursday night.  Yes, I know I can send Peter, Quagmire and Lois to the Borg Cube every hour, but that takes Transporter Energy every time. Which really only getting 500 every 3 or 4 times makes it only feasable to get it 4 times per day, because it would take 4 hours just to get more Transporter Energy because my main source for that energy was Peter w/ his 2 hr task. Worf is fighting Borg for ore, we can only have 2 of each Enterprise room, or I would have 12 rooms giving me transporter energy. I have 100 of the life support energy, over 50 phaser energy and almost 30 Syth Ore and more than enough Dark Matter even after buying Captain Pike Joe.  Sorry for the long post. I've missed sleep on a dozen occasions for this even and not to get the ""top prize"" in the end is a little bit crappy. I do have a suggestion to Tiny Co (as if they read this) but why not leave the Replicator in Quahog and have the new buildings and characters still give Dilithium. Sure, you would only get a few hundred a day, but after a while... everyone could get Kirk, Stewie, all the buildings, etc."
familyguythegame,347yfx,sickofants,2,Wed Apr 29 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"it's clear the event was unbalanced, after the first week nothing felt right. Before the last 2 replicator buildings were made available their payouts were listed as 100 Dilithium every hour, that would have helped but not sure where all your transporter energy went? I have more than enough and don't feel I did anything in particular to earn it. Only spent it to earn items to complete tasks and several trips for Herbert's costume."
familyguythegame,347yfx,koteuop,0,Wed Apr 29 18:29:35 2015 UTC,"It was 25 attempts to get Herbert, and 10 trips to the Borg Cube per day that sucks all the Transporter Energy away, also used a lot sending Meg to that planet that could give 750 Dilithium, without the success everyone else seemed to have there."
familyguythegame,347yfx,-dudeman,-3,Wed Apr 29 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"I have everything (except the premium content), and finished it all without even using clams much less buying any. I just didn't care for this event because A) I am not a fan of anything Star Trek, and B) the requirements to unlock characters were an absolute chore-like grind.  As far as point A is concerned, that's minor. Not every event will be something loved by all. I understand and accept that. Where point B is concerned, I spent the time and effort to get everything unlocked. An extension for the event would mean I could have and should have slacked off. If they do go ahead with an extension, that is a slap in the face to everyone who spent clams to complete the goals within the originally stated time limit, AND to everyone who made the effort to get it done for free.  I understand there were issues for some involving not being able to access the game, but that is not a good excuse for extending the event. If anything, a small form of compensation should be given to people who had issues. The event should end at the time advertised as the expiration for the past 6 weeks, it's not as if the end date snuck up on anyone."

familyguythegame,347n09,Necrofamicom,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"You do have better luck with just one character. If RNGsus is on your side, you should have enough time left to do it, too.  Basically, every character increases the odds of getting the various drops, except Herbert's outfit, which never increases. So keeping those other odds low means they won't overwrite your chance of getting Herbert's costume. It can take a while, I needed between ten and twenty trips. But if you start now and check it every time the mission is over, then you should still have enough time to get it."
familyguythegame,347n09,-dudeman,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"The chances of getting things from away missions are calculated separately. You can get all the drops in one trip, no drops, or only some drops. Therefore, sending just one character or all the available characters makes absolutely no difference. There is no overwriting of chances at anything."
familyguythegame,347n09,Necrofamicom,2,Wed Apr 29 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"Well that's just simply untrue. You can only get one item from a task, and they're rolled sequentially, not one at a time. TinyCo basically confirmed this at the beginning of the event when they told people the game would only produce an item for the brewery if you'd already failed to get an item for the Star Trek event."
familyguythegame,347n09,-dudeman,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"Character tasks may very well work that way, and I do not disagree with that, but away missions are not character tasks, and Brewery items are separate from Star Trek items. That being said, Bonnie did on one occasion drop the synthesizer ore as well as another Star Trek item needed for a character. At the same time.  I suppose you'd like to explain to me how I have on a few occasions received multiple drops from away missions? Specifically, I got phaser energy and dilithium crystals from Beta Max once, I got both the 500 DC and 5 clams from the Borg Cube once, and when I got Edo Herbert I also got the 15 DC. Once, maybe a glitch. Twice, interesting. But for it to happen three times, I believe it just works that way.  If your experience differs, maybe you are just unlucky."
familyguythegame,347n09,Necrofamicom,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I've never seen or heard of anyone getting more than one drop at a time before."
familyguythegame,347n09,-dudeman,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"In the entire time I have been doing away missions it has occurred three times. Because it's happened more than once I don't believe it is a glitch, but because it happens so infrequently I do believe that it's supposed to be an extremely rare occurrence.  Either that, or it has been a glitch all this time and now that I posted about it I can be damn sure it will never happen again. Hahaha.  I don't recall what items Bonnie was dropping, or which character/costume they were for, but I'm thinking it was possibly a q-tip... Regardless, one time she did drop that item and a synthesizer ore simultaneously, so maybe the fact both were Star Trek items allowed for that possibility, rare as it clearly was."
