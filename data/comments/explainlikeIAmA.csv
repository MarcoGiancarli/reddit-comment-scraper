As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

When supply goes DOWN, demand goes UP. If you have a king size bag of m and ms, maybe you eat half of them. But when you have a tube of those mini m and ms, maybe you eat the whole thing! This is literally rule one and is what we call 'supply and demand.' If you need more explanation just look up Milton Friedman. Some of his theories are going out of date and I have an idea that will supplant them and update them to account for digital paradigms, but he is pretty much on the ball. Idiots like Obama would do well to remember that. Honestly I would write a longer rebuttal but I am already late for my MENSA meeting and I need to go have a debate that is more on my level."
explainlikeIAmA,3e3efm,Catharrrsis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

""Mister Bond. Again, I really deserve to be afforded the respect of any Doctor. Of course I am using full restraints properly affixed to the work.

He talks about passive nihilism and active nihilism: the first is an 'inability to believe' and the second an 'inability to continue to believe in something particular'. That something is most especially God, a shoddy kind of truth. The emptying experience of nihilism is, though destructive, a liberating experience as we shake off the shackles of past truths, values that now ring false. But our destiny isn't an embrace of nothingness or meaninglessness. It's getting oneself ready for a creation of newer, stronger values. Nietzsche not only thought of himself as first to diagnose this disease, but also as the prototype for its cure.    So nihilism is not a modus vivendi, a design for living, but a low to which we must sink before rising:    '[W]hy has the advent of nihilism become necessary? Because the values we have had hitherto thus draw their final consequence; because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals--because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these ""values"" really had.--We require, sometime, new values.

explainlikeIAmA,3dljml,FerralWombat,47,Fri Jul 17 06:33:02 2015 UTC,"As I sat in the theater with my tub of popcorn and box of tissues, I prepared myself for quite an experience. What is arguably the most anticipated film of the last decade, especially among all my pregnancy-fetish fans, was about to air. 131 minutes later I left the theater, disappointed, unaroused, and blue-balled.   First, while a 2+ hour long movie sounded interesting at the start (if a bit exhausting for the performers), I found myself quickly tiring of the movie and the long, drawn-out, inexplicably sexless dialogue scenes.  The film opens with establishing a bit of context, which I appreciate. I need to understand why a lonely housewife is having cucumbers jammed up her snatch, or I just can't get into it. But just as a man who likes beer is entitled to complain when he's drowned in a vat of Guinness, I felt as though the context-establishing scenes dragged on a bit.   While most films may start with some establishing shots of our leading lady warming up or our leading man admiring his lemon tree, this film opens with a completely unrelated actor lying dead in a clown costume, and while I pride myself on being open-minded, I've just never been able to get into necrophilic coulrophilia, no matter how many times I've tried.   The film then transitions into more world-building, and by now, my lotion was starting to dry out. Our leading man is established, and while he's decent-looking, I can't even see his equipment through his pants. Is this setting up to be one of those limp-dick fetish films?  Finally, after quite of lot of setup and expensive action scenes that, while enjoyable, certainly must have taken a lot out of the fluffing budget, we finally meet our leading lady. Meh. While attractive, she doesn't look as though she could suck a golf ball through a garden hose, and that's all I'm looking for in a possible mother to my children. She and the leading man overact at each other (standard fare for one of my films, but a little worse), then she disappears and he continues to blow things up. He dresses up as a clown again, and just when I think we're starting to get into something that will appeal to the more liberated members of my fanbase (yes David, I got your letters), there's just more action. By now, my erection is dejectedly wilting and security's been called, so I left the theater of my own free will. Honest.  My fellow reviewers tell me that the eventual payoff for all of this talking and action is a brief, vanilla scene between our leads that doesn't even end with someone covered in baby batter. So all in all, I can't recommend this film. I was promised a golf pencil being thrown down a somehow-famous hallway, and I was left with nothing but explosions, gunfights, and more action scenes than you can shake a dildo out.   In the end, don't see Octopussy. If you want to see bad performers over-act at each other before screwing like bunnies in heat for no adequately explained reason, go watch Game of Thrones!"

explainlikeIAmA,3dl4ce,TacoSauce,5,Fri Jul 17 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"Chapter 26: ""90s kids""  Realistically, a ""90s kid"" was a humanoid who was entering their later formative years (ages 13 to 18) between their calendar's years of 1990 and 1999, while their society were on the cusp of global communication, completely transforming their technology and bringing them forth into a new era. It was during this decade that humanoids became a Gizu Class intelligent species, by creating a means of instant communication between every member of the species, which they called the World Wide Web, or (later) simply, The Internet. However, the political and sociological shock that The Internet created introduced a mire of problems that delayed their further technological aspirations that began with the ""90s kid"" generation, and they would not upgrade to Fyei Class, which requires mind link communication, until their calendar year of 2231 (and it is speculated that this later technological shock spelled their downfall in the Nuclear Incident of 2279, in which they also inadvertently eradicated the Pezehelyee people of Mercury, and destroyed the nearby star).   The humanoid adolescents of this time were among the first to be nursed into an era where this new technology they had invented became mainstream, and our scientists are still seeking further information to determine what impacts this era had on science, art, culture, politics, and the beings that lived through it.   Precious artifacts from this time in humanoid history are housed in the Galactic Culture Museum on Aleoon 4, including a tattered tome entitled Goosebumps (still undergoing translation), a small rectangular object with text that has been determined to read ""Sean's Totally Awesome Nirvana Mixtape"" with no known purpose, and the cryogenically frozen body of one humanoid politician named Bill Clinton (who shall remain frozen for security reasons).   Additionally, there were also a small sub-generation of humanoids, typically born between the years of 1996 and 1999, but who went through their formative years sometime later, who referred to themselves as ""90s kids,"" incorrectly using the cultural references and technology which their species had created just a short time earlier. It is often speculated that this generation may have been responsible for a heinous event in 2043 in which the entire population of some poorer areas of their planet was chemically converted into burnable fuel, after their non-renewable resources were exhausted. This new short-lived source of fuel was used to power one of their ""servers"" for The Internet, which slightly extended their supply of a highly addictive medium known as ""dank memes,"" a concept that the brightest minds in the galaxy are still attempting to understand."

Makes sense, surviving winter in the dark ages must have been tough.  And they all just keep killing each other, although that's probably the creator's doing because George R. R.

The previous king was probably brutally killed, and they're like ""Welp, the only heir is a kid. Oh well."" He sounds like a nasty little shit, too. But violence begets violence, after all. He sits on a thrown of swords for heaven's sake.  So essentially it's Survivor in a much more TV-MA setting. Oh, and sex. And incest. Lots of incest.  But my description is probably all wrong. After all, I know nothing."

Despite his physical ailments, a pair of limp legs acquired during the fall of the Mad King, Biggalt Lebowski maintains a lavish house and young brides. He keeps a positive image in the kingdoms with charitable acts such as entering peasant children into training to achieve knight-hood.   His banner men are loyal, because Lebowski tends to his own, which is why his house is generally left alone. That was, however, until a seemingly unimportant man who happened to share the Lebowski house name was mistaken for a Lord of House Lebowski and assaulted by thugs working for the House of Treehorn, who intended to collect a debt that Biggalt Lebowski had not paid.   Lebowski, not wanting his reputation tarnished, enlisted this other Lebowski to chase after his ""stolen"" young bride. However behind the guise of the tragic story of a friendly, crippled old Lord, lies the truth that Biggalt had no intention of rescuing his wife, and instead used the borrowed gold to keep for himself. The other Lebowski, now commonly referred to as the Duke of Lebowski, clashes several times with both the House of Treehorn and the band of thieves who were hired by Biggalt's fled wife to collect a hefty ransom at the Lord's expense.   During a final show down between the Duke and his companions the thieves are defeated, though not without killing that one friend of Duke's that everyone really likes.   when the dust settles, and many plans thwarted, everything returns to normal, and the Kingdom of House Lebowski goes on living out its old lies."

Paradoxically, this had served him well for a while, keeping him out of conflicts, but with winter coming—well, the young Lebowski was more a summer sort.  Perhaps what was most unique about House Lebowski is that no one really wanted to rule it—in fact, its most significant conflict had arisen when the wastrel prince had been mistaken for a high-and-mighty fellow, an unrelated Jefforen Lebowski with reputed ties to Lannister gold. The lesser Lebowski only suffered for being associated with this wealth and power that was not actually his, and many threats were made against his Johnson in a distinctly House Boltonian manner.  (Fortunately, during this scuffle, he entered into as close a contract to marriage as he would be ever likely to pursue with this wealthy Lebowski family, and it is said that he emerged from it all in as good a humor as he was when he began.)  After scattering the ashes of his friend Donnal with his closest ally Ser Walder (reportedly a Targaryen), Jefforen Lebowski was last seen practicing for a great tourney, quite unconcerned with the war raging around him."
explainlikeIAmA,3di5z3,Capitan_Math,82,Thu Jul 16 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"So the OP/Girl MU is well known to be one of the worst in the game, but let me give you some tips.  Girl is a very fast character w/ an excellent dash dance; probably one of the best in the game tbh.  Now, no two Girls are alike, but you're just not gonna win neutral very often again Girls because of this deceptive DD range. They're definitely gonna be on the lookout for when you eventually over-commit and whiff punish accordingly. You really have to play the MU agressively, but like I said, if you're not careful about when you push your advantages, you're gonna get bodied by even low level Girls, because OP is just honestly not a very good character. I would suggest you pick up a secondary--the most common I see is Wingman because his laser game really locks down Girls--but if you're committed to sticking with OP, I suggest you focus on reading Girls' dash dance habits.  If a Girl just raw dash dances, it's usually safe to try a more straightforwards approach (you might even be able to just run up and grab!), but if it's a higher level Girl you'll have to be on the lookout for nasty down tilt pokes and pivot tricks. At this point you're really going to have to try to go in with some more thought out approaches. You might be able to space a dunk over a down tilt if you get the read, but it's honestly not safe to ever approach a solid Girl when you're stuck with a low tier like OP.  To have any hope of winning the MU, you're really going to have to focus on pushing your punishment game as far as you can every time you manage to score a hit on a Girl. OP has some nasty chaingrabs on most of the cast, and you can basically always confirm these into a finisher. I think it's really difficult for OP to maintain a presence and not get backed into a corner when facing Girl, but they honestly combo each other pretty comparably.  I'd really suggest you train up a Wingman if you want a shot at winning over some solid Girls, but if you're loyal to OP you might be able to eke out some surprise wins so long as you don't drop the spaghetti and you really focus on optimizing your conversions.  I hope this helps! Good luck out there!"

That shit is too old, IMO, I always say the only game is new game. Just don't argue with them, it'll only make your relationship more toxic.   Anyway. First you gotta pick your main strategy. Handsome? Use your looks. Good with words? Use them. Funny? Tell jokes. Make sure you practice with only your main point, do it online of you have to.  Once you get used to them, it's time to look at the neutral stage. You and your potential partner walk up to eachother and you don't have an advantage, or disadvantage. Always think of your defence, your shield if it were. Always make sure you have a way out, either by backing out, jumping out, or sidestepping her question. Keep your head cool and know what your options are. If it's a team game, you can have your wingman take the hit.   Now for the offensive, wait until she makes a mistake. If she stutters, capitalise on it. Make sure to keep her engaged, give her no time to back out. But be wary of your options. Don't overextend. How far you can go depends on your main approach, her main approach and how much % she's interested. You should figure out which combos work and when.   Now if things don't go to well, know how to recover. Almost as important as making it back on your feet: you have to do so without her reading your moves. Be unpredictable and don't make it to obvious. If she can read your next move, she can slam you down hard.   Finally, if you really want to improve: Practice, talk to girls whenever you can even go to gatherings, where there are lots of girls. And even if you don't make it, don't feel bad, but recall what went wrong and improve on it."

explainlikeIAmA,3dj2xb,The_name_game,3,Thu Jul 16 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I have grave concerns about you mortals and your culture. I can see you have little time for your news, so allow me to explain.  It is my understanding that this Bill, Son of Cosby is a much-beloved comedian and actor of your culture. He seems best known for having played this man Huxtable on a Cosby show. I have streamed some episodes of this show on the computers of my mortal friends, and Huxtable does seem a likeable man. Gentle, wise, and paternal, he seems a loving father, if no warrior. Indeed, he struck me as quite harmless, but not lacking in strength of spirit. I understand this show to have been much beloved, especially by those whose ancestors hail from Africa. They are much underrepresented in your culture, and what appearances they make in your media often see to villify them.  From this point, it seems Cosby has acquired some reputation as a sage, a source of moral wisdom. People of American culture, especially these African Americans, looked to him for guidance, confusing, perhaps deliberately, the man with the character he played. Given that the show was named for him rather than the character, it seems an understandable mistake. Nonetheless, in his  attempts to educate the people on their obligations, he reached some unpopular conclusions.   I have listened to and read his pound cake speech, which I understand to be a major reason the judge in this newest case against him unsealed certain documents. In the speech he argues that African Americans are in some ways to blame for the racism and poverty they experience by way of not instilling into their children appropriate fear and shame of wrongdoing. I have heard many mortals of this America repeat such sentiments about mortals of all races, but Cosby was notable in this for being of African-American extraction addressing his own people.   Now Cosby is accused of having raped a number of women, while married to his wife, even after having condemned infidelity in his speech. It is said that he gave these women drugs that rendered them docile or unconscious before forcing themselves on them, though detractors of these allegations claim that most individuals in those eras took drugs during consensual acts of that manner, and that the women must have had some idea of what he meant to do when he presented them with pills.  The sheer number of these allegations has many unable to withhold judgement, and as a result Cosby has had a number of his engagements cancelled. Further damaging his reputation is the release of a document from a previous court case relating to these allegations. Because of the Pound Cake speech I mentioned before, the judge decided that Cosby is a source of moral wisdom, and released documentation of his testimony. It seems he admitted that he purchased these drugs ""quaaludes,"" which I understand to be potent drugs that induce sleep or stupor, in order to know young women.  Even if these women knew his intentions and voluntarily acquiesced to his advances... he does stand in great contrast to the loving, loyal father he played on television.   A great many, the women in my life included, also have some concerns about how your media have portrayed him and these women. Some say that so many accusations are themselves proof, and that it should not take his own admission to render those accusations valid. While I find that may be too simple, there is some justification there. Something clearly is amiss in the life of Bill Cosby for these accusations to be as viable as they are copious.  Which brings me to you, Batman. I have little understanding of this culture, truly, but surely I have missed some detail here that might clarify your mortal ways. You have a reputation for being most wise, and having great insight into the darkest minds of men. Perhaps you can help me understand what might motivate this Cosby--whether he meant to take from these women something they had no desire to give, or only to experience their affections with little input from them beyond their first consent."

I actually have no idea how to answer your question as you intended it to be as I am ultimately an uncreative person (I hope the thing above will suffice), so I'm going to answer it my way. I may make some mistakes, and thus I'd appreciate corrections to them. Let's begin with some definitions.   Socialism: is a society where the means of production are held under common control; Bolshevists would view this as a period where the proletariat gain control of political power (dictatorship of the proletariat) and the revolution is defended from reaction. Communism: is a society where a post-scarcity economy has been realized, divisions like class have ceased to exist, money has ceased to exist and naturally the means of production are held under common control; this would in theory take a long time after a communist revolution. Marxism: is a philosophy that is derived from Holbach's materialism and Hegelian dialectics. Marxism actually has nothing to do with communism, it's merely a way of analyzing history and the world. The 'materialist conception of history' is a way of studying history by analyzing material conditions. Dialectics are used to study relations of production (simply put, class). Dialectical analysis is ancient Greek logic revived by Hegel then ""turned on its head"" by Marx that states that the contradictions of two things (the thesis and antithesis) result in something new (the synthesis). For example the conflict between feudal lords and serfs (two opposites) resulted in capitalism, therefore the conflict between proletariat and the bourgeoisie (two opposites) will result in socialism.  Proletariat and bourgeoisie: are, all historical factors aside, simply the employee and the capitalist Leninism: like Marxism, this has nothing to do with communism, it's merely a way of organizing a 'vanguard' (i.e. the revolutionary vanguard of the working class form a political party to inspire class consciousness). This party is organized under the principle of 'democratic centralism', which Lenin describes as being “diverse in discussion, [but] unified in action”. Bolshevism: is an archaic term, followers of Lenin. It can refer to M-Ls, 'revisionist' M-Ls, Trotskyists, and so on. See below. Trotskyism: the view of Trotsky as Lenin's co-leader; opposition to Stalin and the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialism in one country in favor of the permanent revolution Marxism-Leninism: is, theoretically, the union of Marxist philosophy with Leninist organization; an ideology espoused by the Soviet Union under Stalin. Even though that first bit sounds like it could apply to, for example, Trotsky - note I used 'theoretically'. This is because of the aforementioned position of socialism in one country. Stalin stated that it was possible for the USSR to build socialism alone (a response to the external enemies surrounding the USSR), whereas Trotsky didn't. Trotsky viewed this as a betrayal of Marxism, and critiqued Stalin's definition of the USSR as a socialist society, viewing it instead as a 'degenerated worker's state' where a bureaucracy took over.  'Stalinism': isn't actually an ideology, it's used to insult the policies of Marxist-Leninist parties and constitutionally socialist states headed by Marxist-Leninist Anti-Revisionism: is an ideology of Marxist-Leninists opposed to the de-Stalinization that occurred in Khrushchev's USSR after Stalin's death; those who see the theoretical leaders of communism as Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin   As for communism today, well, it depends on where you look. Communists are revolting in India, to a lesser extent in the Phillipines, Peru, Colombia and have succeeded in Nepal, and form mainstream political parties in Moldova, Cyprus, Russia and Belarus. The actual commitment of these groups to communism outside of their name can be confusing (the KPRF, for instance, is strongly nationalist and very socially conservative). Greece, too, has a big communist movement with the communist tendency of SYRIZA and the KKE as a result of not just the historical situation of Greece, but most importantly the economic situation. The US is due for another recession, and a generation of individuals not exposed to Cold War propaganda is growing up with a 'socialist' running for president with popular support (though how socialist he really is, is a question) a communist council[wo]man of Seattle. The future is looking bright for communism."

Khrushchev says that he is willing to use his own instant called Launch Missiles that allows the USSR to attack at any time, even the opponent's turn, if Kennedy doesn't get rid of Naval Blockade. Kennedy, knowing that this would lead to both players simultaneously losing, decides not to play Naval Blockade as long as Khrushchev won't play Missiles in Cuba.

I'd like to think I do.   The way I was brought up and the way I was taught have shown me a lot of different views of the world. I was educated. I went to a good school to learn about the world and to learn a skill set so I could make an impact. To change everything. But right now I'm trapped.   The way the system is set up is to a point where someone can live their life with the bare minimum, never escape the cycle, and go on about their day. That doesn't help people. It doesn't help anyone but the people at the top. The wealthy and the people in control don't give a shit about anyone like you or me. The scope of our problems is huge, and I can't break out to help anyone else. I can't help change the laws of the country you live in. I cant help the people around me. I cant feed a starving child on the street.   They taught me how to be aware of what they were doing, and then forced me into a situation where all I can do is watch. I know I don't get beaten. I know I have my ""autonomy."" But in the end you and I are just people born to work for others and then die. In the best of situations, surrounded by those we love.

The total price of a slave and his lodging and food is the same as the sum of all the wages ever received by a day-labourer. We get to the part where he talks about slavery in America. We realise that when the profit is high enough a slaver may decide to grind all his slaves to death in an instant. They have next to no possibility organize resistance either because they are under total control of their owners (I explain that my owners are constantly trying to attain this in capitalism as well). We realise that bourgeois liberals opposed supposedly to serfdom and slavery are hypocrites.    That same “reformed” Parliament, which in its delicate consideration for the manufacturers, condemned children under 13, for years to come, to 72 hours of work per week in the Factory Hell, on the other hand, in the Emancipation Act, which also administered freedom drop by drop, forbade the planters, from the outset, to work any negro slave more than 45 hours a week.    We also realise that the presence of slave labour makes life for hired labourers significantly worse since they have to compete against labour procured forever.

The gang are all a bunch of old, over-the-hill actors, there was the guy who was in Fargo, a fat one, a secretly gay one, and Eli Roth. They all start playing poker and making these witty one liners when they hear the baby start to cry. They realize OOOPS, BABIES NEED BABY FOOD TO BABY LIVE, so they try to send one of their own out to get some supplies after the make the call to the baby's owners (their contact info was written inside the baby).  So the group are all playing gin rummy or some shit when the guy they sent out to get baby supplies sees the parents in line at a Duane Reade. The family recognizes the guy because of his voice and chases him down the street, when the guy just whips out two guns and blows away a cop trying to intervene. The dad manages to get inside the warehouse when the guy runs straight back to the hideout.  The gang manages to get the drop on him, but Robin Williams (THAT was one of them, I just remembered) starts clowning and the guy tries killing himself when Robin gets to his third munchkin impersonation. They start playing that song ""Stuck in the Middle"" by Cannibal Corpse as Robin saws off the dad's ear with a straight razor as the baby squeals with delight.  I gotta be honest I don't remember a whole lot of the middle of the movie so I'll try to summarize with a bulletpoint:  -A guy starts talking about his daddy and no one seems uncomfortable about that -Eli Roth gets dizzy doing the plant-a-baseball-bat-and-spin-in-a-circle trick and has to lie down for a while -Clint Eastwood has to euthanize Hilary Swank after she breaks her neck -The chubby guy that looks like wolverine keeps telling the baby's gonna be okay. -I guess Batman FIGHTS Superman now? Like they don't even try to get along?  Or whatever. Then they get into a Mexican standoff and they're all killed when the baby trips the hammer on an uzi and blows off all their ankles.

Well, as she gets closer and closer to looking like a real person, suddenly it gets weird. Suddenly she's close enough that it's unsettling. She almost looks human, but then something is wrong, and it's creepy. She's deep, deep in uncanny valley. Things that are too close to looking like us without being close enough freak us out.   Some people think this is because of ancient conflict between early homo sapiens and neanderthals, who would have looked kinda like but not quite like us. When we're the only people on the planet, it um, it doesn't matter as much, but we still get like... creepy dolls... and bad reactions to bad CG? Anyway, the name uncanny valley comes from the fact that if you drew a graph with um, how much we like something versus how human it looks, there's this valley where a likeness becomes uncanny and that's weird.

Aye, I may die, Jon Snow, but I'll fuckin' live first. I'll do what I want to do: kill Crows, you maybe. Don't care about honor, or family, or orders, or words. Just... this.

Mac: How am I doing it wrong?  Dennis: You see, because Dee stuttered on the ""juh"" sound. Juh juh juh. You hear that? The gaps? Of course, because I'm actually making a sound between the gaps, so you can tell that I'm stuttering. Charlie, with the ""hah hah,"" I mean, you can barely even notice that there's a stutter and, of course, it's a completely different sound from what Dee made.  Mac: Well what about me? You could tell mine was a stutter.  Dennis: Better, I'll give you that. Better than Charlie's, at any rate, which was barely audible, but still the ""uh uh,"" while audible, doesn't quite match the timbre of Dee's stutter, so the humor is lost.  Dee: Well Jennifer wants to go to the Grateful Dead's final show, but tickets are $500 each.  Frank: $500? I'm in.  Dennis: Whoa, Frank. That's a lot of quiche for a concert.

explainlikeIAmA,3cfx21,wrestles_bears,198,Tue Jul 7 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"Here, in the urban Serengeti, we come across two of natures' most elusive beasts. Rarely seen in the light of day, two young males approach each other. The larger of the pair sniffs the air inquisitively. Though his breathing is laboured, the scent of the lesser neckbeard is unmistakeable. The musty tangs of cheap Belgian ales have mixed indelibly with an acrid and unspeakably offensive body odour. The greater neckbeard bends over slightly tipping his trilby, a head adornment often mistakenly referred to as a 'fedora', and grunts a greeting. The lesser spotted European neckbeard freezes upon encountering his larger American cousin.   Though similar at first glance there are several distinct differences between these largely predatory animals. The American, more easily distinguishable by his bulk, outweighs the European by several kilograms. A rich diet of dusted corn pieces and the early morning dew of the mountains has given him a substantial advantage over his rival. Circling each other now, one can begin to identify the other telling differences. Though smaller, the European is by no means a tiny beast. Eschewing a challenging exercise regime more commonly practised by 'the bros' found along the shore, he has gained a substantial mass. In plumage too differences can be found. The classy tweed of the European neckbeard, its leather elbow patches both rugged enough to be practical, and flamboyant enough to attract a mate, stands in stark contrast to the more restrained cargo of the American. We can however we also find many similarities. Both possess a fine mane,  which they can be seen eagerly stroking as they circle each other. The furry and unkempt neckbeard for which they were named is covered in a greasy sheen and can sometimes reach several inches in length, though never graces their chins.   A female approaches, though not of the genus but a different class entirely, and we can observe the similarities of their mating call as, distracted from their tentative encounter, they both exclaim ""'M'lady"" in distinct short sharp yelps. The calls this time however go unheeded and the neckbeards, which characteristicly avoid face to face confrontation, slink back to their lairs. Perhaps they'll have better luck tomorrow.   Edit: Spelling, formatting and junk."

explainlikeIAmA,3cfx21,Shezzam,6,Thu Jul 9 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"The sun has risen, yet it remains still cool in the  Summer morning streets of the most esteemed of Comicon Host Cities, San Diego. The native citizens of the city are slow to arise and embrace the beginning of the most anticipated festival of all festivals on the Calendar NeckBeardus. It has been an agonising 362 days wait for our Homo Sapiens Neckbeardii since the closing rituals of 2014's San Diego ComiCon, or ""The SDCC"" as it is affectionately known amongst the Neckbeardii community.   Before too long, we shall see the emergence of the most enthusiastic of the Neckbeardii, the Overnight Camper. The dedicated Neckbeardii will have slept out in assorted recreational or parentally owned vehicles in carparks, within easy Scooty Puffing distance. As with every major the most  truly dedicated of the Neckbeardii have constructed small tent like encampments on the pavements and walkways directly in line with doorways, closest to The Actual Comicon Room. Having been in attendance for at least Comicon Eve; and in the rarest of occasions, several nights ahead of time; ensures the most determined of Neckbeardii that Bragging Rights, and the Coveted Position of being First In The Door, are indisputably and undoubtedly theirs to claim. The Neckbeardii community is held to a most convoluted and rigidly controlled social order. As with all interactions and events of Neckbeardii devotion, the SDCC is assigned complex rules, rituals, expectations and capitulations, and are demanded of all Neckbeardii.   The position of the individual Neckbeardii is paramount to their prosperity and success in both the Neckbeardii community, and life within the broader social context from which the particular Neckbeardii hails. At the pinnacle of Neckbeardliness, reigns the Alpha. All Neckbeardii of lesser social standing are expected to offer tribute to their superior, as appropriate to their own Degree of Neckbeardliness, and that of their superior. The individual ranking of any Neckbeardii is visually represented through a combination of several physiological and behavioural displays. To truly understand the symbolic importance of each icon of Neckbeardliness, we look now to some magnificent specimens from the sub-species Americanus and Anglicanus.  Representing the Americanus we find a relatively youthful yet physically matured specimen in Douglass, a 23 Anime aficionado hailing from Bangor Maine, who lists his greatest passion in life as ""pleasing the Ladies"" and his greatest accomplishment thus far as ""having had coitus"" with ""an actual girl of consenting age"". Truly splendid in his dedication to his pursuit of the Neckbeardii way of life, Douglass has remained in Pole Position, at the Harbor Drive Lobby Entrance, closest to the elevator bank.  From the subspecies Anglicans, we find Lloyd, in the oh-so-close-but-yet-so-far second place ""in line"" behind our Americanus Douglass. Lloyd hails from the granny flat of his mother's home, in the proud city of Manchester. Lloyd lists his greatest passion in life as ""maintaining a mint condition, complete and original collection of Magic The Gathering cards"" and his greatest accomplishment as having found one of the rarest of Pokemon cards, the Pre-Release Raichu. Lloyd covets obtaining the ""Illustrator Pikachu"", currently running at approximately US$100,000 if found in mint condition.    Purely on these personal statements, we are shown that the Neckbeardii primarily values:  1) Actual and Verifiable Consensual, Legal, Physical, Penetrative, Coital contact with the female of the species, commonly referred to anything as gentlemanly as ""MiLady"" or as misogynistic and ""that whore next door"";  2) Acquisition of rare and glorious Pokemon cards.   At this stage, neither of the two specimens observed have made reference to ""fighting against the man"" or ""having extra caloric requirements"" as necessitated by ""medical conditions"" and ""low blood sugars"", common themes of concern and daily struggles amongst the Neckbeardii community.  So, to return to the observations at hand, we see that both Douglass and Lloyd are emerging from their brightly coloured nylon cocoons, Douglass initiating recognition of the lesser being Lloyd is currently considered as being. Both males stretch and posture, in an effort to display their Manliness and primal Supremacy to all those in lower rank, who are behind them in their prestigious positions of First and Second. As Lloyd bends down, we hear the sound of a most ostentatious fart reverberate with the force, smell and speed of the winds of Hell. Not to be outmanoeuvred, Douglass merely raise his right leg centimetres from the ground and unleashes what the observer can only hope sounds as wet as it could potentially be. The stench unleashed from Douglass' bowels can only be likened to that of a decaying corpse that has been soaked in the sewage of a thousand curries and sprinkled with dismembered limbs of all that was previously held nasally pure and holy.  Lloyd bows, tipping the Prime Symbol of all Neckbeardliness, the trilby, and remarks ""Well done, good sir. For I canst only wish to achieve such stench and resonance in mine wildest imaginings!""  Douglass smirks in acknowledgement of the lesser being's ingratiated praise, deigning to reply ""I try dude"". After this moment of acknowledgement, both males turn their attention to the task of breaking down camp and stowing their belongings before the SDCC Official Security Guard arrives to distribute the small placards declaring the holder's position in line to enter the SDCC, thus freeing them for a total of 15 minutes in which they must secure their belongings in a locker or vehicle, attend to any bathroomly needs, obtain sustenance and/or hydration; then return to their place in line. It is merely 17 minutes later that both have successfully collapsed their encampment into duffel bags, and await at their version of attention - leaning against the wall, with an affected air of nonchalance - for the arrival of said Security Guard. The magnificent beasts snap to attention, the only hint that tells of their spying the approaching Security Guard is a tightening of eyebrow distance and the piercing gaze of eyes almost hidden within the soft encompassing folds of their excessively padded eyelids.   Feigning a relaxed movement forward, Douglass extends his hand toward the oncoming Security Guard, whom he detects is potentially a Fair Maid of blonde locks and Petite Form. Further demonstrating his Alpha restraint, he lifts his sparsely bristled chins  as recognition of the Security Guards arrival.  ""Morning, sir, congratulations on being first in line. The time by my watch is now oh eight three seven, you have secured pole position until it is oh eight five nine by my watch. Use the time wisely sir, see you back before oh nine hundred""  Douglass' eyes sparkle in recognition of the Fair Maiden's deferment to his Alpha status, by using the title 'sir'.   ""My lady, I shall not fail this challenge you set before me, for I have not travelled thus far in space and time to fail at these final moments"". Tapping his jauntily, he turns and collects his bags from his feet. Brandishing the placard aloft, we see him walk along the line of hopefuls and decries ""Look hither, fellow Conners! And see the chosen physical embodiment of power and glory that true supremacy is!""  Oblivious to the glares and muttered ""fat fucks"" along the line as Douglass gloats, he fails to recognise that Lloyd has rather surreptitiously handed the Security Guard five folded hundred dollar bills.   ""Care to take thirty seconds off the watch there love?"" Ah, Lloyd has shown his hand, and clearly taken advantage of Douglass' arrogant crowing and master plan to wait until there was thirty seconds remaining in order to maximise crushing the hopes and dreams of his Fellow Conners and Neckbeardii, by returning 'in the nick of time'.  ""Pardon sir?"" our Fair Maiden enquires as she absently looks at the wad of notes that replaced the number two placard in her palm.  Lloyd leans in conspiratorially and whispers ""You see love, I've had to put up with that arse for 37 hours now. On an' on about 'is Grand Plan and 'ow 'e came here a week ago, timing and mapping the 'Combat Zone' as 'e called it, and how 'e was finally going to get the Grand Entrance the universe has robbed 'im of for the past twenty three years."" Lloyd leans back loudly proclaiming ""Thanks Miss! Most honoured Miss! Wot time ya knockin' off Miss, come fer a drink love?"" Ah, this is surely a supremely intelligent Neckbeardii, one who might be thought to have a higher than average grasp of the psychological and intellectual capabilities that the average Neckbeardii."

And yet, I have glimpsed upon a future with technology that I couldn't even begin to fathom.  Horseless carriages, a mere pipe dream in my time, have become common place. They race around, powered by kerosene, and the roads stretch to the horizon, made not of dirt, but of pitch and rock.  And yet, that is just the beginning. The volley guns of my day have been replaced with rifles that fire with such rapidity and ferociousness that I cannot fathom how they can still bear the costs of war, and yet they do.  Moving pictures have become common place, no longer a curiosity of Edison's, but instead, have become miniaturized, everywhere. The masses can view the president with their own two eyes, as he dictates his policy.. Stranger still, he is a negro. Times have certainly changed.  I have glimpsed upon ships which have pierced the sky, to leave the clutches of the very earth itself, and in this glimpse of the future, I have hope.

You're at a Q&A with the guy that created a ton of iconic characters and sat next to him is the guy who came up with Ultron, yet you feel the need to ask such an idiotic question? Fuck you, random guy in that Q&A.  So George Lucas, do you know if Khan will return in the new Star Trek?  So George R. R.

explainlikeIAmA,3cc1r6,EDGY_USERNAME_HERE,11,Tue Jul 7 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"Liefeld literally ripped off Deathstroke. Originally, Deadpool was played completely straight as a 90s era Bloodpouch type of character.  Wasn't until later that the absurdity of this ""extreme"" style was mocked, and Deadpool became the catalyst for self-parody of the subgenre. And as he passed from writer to writer, he just naturally evolved into a parody on comics in general, even incorporating his breaking of the 4th wall as an actual superpower."

explainlikeIAmA,3cb90w,RayComfortsBanana,28,Mon Jul 6 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Remember how Nazi Germany slowly instituted authoritarianism with appeals to efficiency, nationalism, and the need to counter terrorism? Remember how Germany, under the Nazi party, slowly politicized science and dismantled academia?  Today America is pursuing similar policies. It pursues a strong national strategic posture for competing with other nations, but this leads to the strengthening of the top corporations and its leadership at the lack of attention to mom and pop, and in general mobility within its economy. Only the politically connected are able to get the widely regarded crony capitalist loans made by its semi-secretive Export-Import bank. It weaponizes its businesses - for example its use afixing international law to favor US companies inside the Trans Pacific Partnership in a bid to contain and isolate China. Or its partnership to produce propaganda with large US media companies, with examples as recent as the SONY hacks. The Snowden documents showed that the US had been investing in backdoors across its entire tech sector to surveil foreign entities and even its own population - and now the DoD is redoubling an effort to work with VCs to defund encryption and fund national security objectives in Silicon valley. Similar to Germany, it justifies laws that aid its top industries for international competition on a myth about efficiency.  The American narrative and mythology is similar. Just as Hitler invoked a sense of exceptionalism for Germanic decent, American exceptionalism is on high gear - and even received warning and criticism in by Vladimir Putin well-spoken enough to be a front page piece published through the New York Times. America feels that international law applies selectively to it as it regularly finances terrorist and insurgent forces and organizes for coups of its geopolitical adversaries. It even convinced its people through internationally coordinated propaganda that not only did Iraq and Saddam have something to do with the 9/11 attacks, but that intervening in Iraq would be a plausible mechanism to curtail future terrorism - then instituting policies where it assassinates not only 'militant aged males' in the middle east for merely being born in the wrong location by an automated kill system but also American citizens who had never taken any violent action against the United States for speaking out against United States policy - all without a court system. The US plans to deploy similar predator drone systems to blanket its own skies and retains the executive authority to kill American citizens if it deems them a threat to national security - even if that citizen could be apprehended and is otherwise not immediately involved in a violent action against the state. The US has repealed and weaken anti-propaganda law and has expanded its capabilities to track and direct conversation in social media and participates in astroturfing and intervention in online communications (e.g. Operation Earnest Voice).  These policies are justified by an appeal to anti-terrorism - a threat that, by its own definition (the use of violence to achieve political objectives) it spends more than any other country, and in tandem with other state sponsors of terror, funding overseas. It has 'accidentally' shipped anthrax overseas to North Korean officials (through SK offices) and is currently planning to overthrow this regime and it repealed Cold War treaties and moves ballistic missile systems and NATO presence outside the borders of its old Soviet adversary, provoking its eventual aggressive response. It's partnerships with local media obscure the US downing of commercial airliner Air Flight 655 while it criticizes the BUK accident of MH17 over Ukraine.  The United States funded groups to head international scientific efforts has, because of its strategic value, sought to exaggerate the immediate short-term importance of climate change, and has simultaneously stalled global warming multilateral cooperation across the globe.  It supports international criminals who align with the United States and coup even democratically elected governments that oppose it. It tortures adversaries for intelligence (or 'outsources it' when it causes a scandal) and makes the same references the Stasi did to how efficient and useful a tactic it is to achieve strategic objectives.  The US today only has two parties which mostly align on all of the above - though they disagree on some small issues like homosexual marriage. They present these issues are divisive and allow their citizens to choose between parties on these issues, but never give them a chance to learn about the larger issues, to participate in the treasure from neoimperialism, or to choose representatives that reflect the American ideal that ALL PEOPLE have inalienable rights - not just US citizens - an idea that was discarded in the early 1900's by its Supreme Court.  The US has started to implement policies such as 'choice architecture' and has appointed thinkers such as Cass Sunstein (who wrote a book title ""The Problem of Free Speech"") to important positions for determining future US policy.  While claiming to be the most transparent administration, the US currently has been hiding its support of ISIL against the Assad regime and its international (illegal) arms running in the Middle East and has cracked down on domestic encryption and has isolated and threatened whistleblowers inside of its ranks.  So just while it seemed like things were going okay when Hitler, who was thought of as a war hero and a man who loved his country, began policies in Germany that lifted it out of its national debt and the ruin of WWI, the US has a momentum in a direction that is wholly dangerous. While it tries to maintain its global hegemony against rising powers it risks continuing to sacrifice civil liberties for security and strategic advantage. Having lost much of the support from its historical strongest allies, the US will need to avoid this worst case scenario of ever sliding into autocratic, nationalistic and security obsessed drive to maintain its hegemony at all costs - even the cost of its values and civil rights."
explainlikeIAmA,3cb90w,seattlyte,10,Mon Jul 6 21:20:04 2015 UTC,Very well written and thought out. Now can we get a ELI5?
explainlikeIAmA,3cb90w,seattlyte,13,Mon Jul 6 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"Oh goodness.  By all accounts after WWI Hitler's Nazi party did a great number of wonderful things to improve the quality of life inside of Germany. Under Hitler not only did the lives of Germans improve in real ""material"" terms, but the strength of Germany relative to its immediate neighbors accelerated.  The Nazi party found that they needed to motivate their population by appealing to base instincts - national identity and exceptionalism, by directing and framing the speech open for public discussion, and by appealing to fearful scenarios such as terrorists.  The United States is facing a decade where it is 'out of breath' and its power has been 'hollowing out'. It has been making appeals to the same set of base instincts and has been increasingly invested in nationalistic policies to frame public debate, nudge scientific discussion and research, make financial and economic decisions within the private sector for its security interests (e.g. Nacchio), and  by appealing to wars against things things like drugs and terrorism that can not end (there is no victory condition) to perpetuate the need to appeal to executive privilege and wartime powers.  As the US performs the calculus to balance civil and human rights against its objectives, interest and security there has been an increasing trend to lean toward the latter - toward security and objectives over human and civil rights. The creep is slow (as it was in Germany) and the endgame is uncertain. What's understood now is that the United States, whose press freedom score decreased this past year (for example), will continue to make hard decisions. It's momentum is in the direction that, if continued, could very well lead to a 'rhyme' in history to Germany - a country that would not sacrifice its ambitions when faced with serious ultimatums about civil and human rights."

Furthermore the U.S. and EU are quite geopolitically aligned.   sought to exaggerate the immediate short-term importance of climate change, and has simultaneously stalled global warming multilateral cooperation across the globe.   Do tell, please.   American exceptionalism is on high gear   I see strong exceptionalist sentiment shown from a lot of US government officials, that is true, but not a whole lot from President Obama himself, especially post-midterms, and I think relatively speaking the administration has toned down the talk compared to most administrations in the last ~40 years.  And of course, for how valid Putin's criticism is, he certainly has no problem exercising similar rhetoric at home and riding a wave of popular support sustained by the people's nostalgia for when Russia dominated Eastern Europe.  A lot of things happen in our daily lives that concern me, but to suggest that it is going the way of Germany, which sought to establish military dominance over an entire continent as well as fulfill his idea of a racially pure society, is a bit ludicrous."

The Reddit admins recently fired Victoria, aka /u/chooter, and that threw a massive wrench into the whole AMA process.  So the mods of a whole bunch of subreddits set their subs to private, in protest at yet another short-sighted action by the Reddit admins.  They wanted to bring to light the fact that the tools and support mods are given are patently insufficient, and make their jobs as volunteer moderators practically untenable.    And then the Reddit admins promised to take concrete action, so the mods had to decide whether to continue their blackout.  Some of them did, but most of them chose to open up their subreddits again.  That meant that the remaining subreddits also opened, because there was no longer the critical mass of closed subreddits to make a difference.    So, in effect, when the question of whether to continue the blackout was put to the mods, they voted no.    Hey, by the way, you look pretty tired and zoned out.  You might want to get some sleep, and then come back when you're rested.  Otherwise you might end up mixing up the Greek referendum and the Reddit blackout, and that'd be hilarious."

explainlikeIAmA,3c6ako,KurtDunn,20,Sun Jul 5 06:11:33 2015 UTC,"You're asking two seperate things. Since someone else explained who E.P. is, I'll explain 'what's going on with reddit'.   As reddit has grown, it has been out growing it's tools available for the mods to run large subs. Mod mail is a huge mess. The tools for moderating the subs are subpar. And the administration has a hit or miss representation in communicating with mods to solve issues.   Chooter/Victoria was an assencenddd mod that turned into an administrator (I think that's the back story?). Her biggest job was to be a go between for celebrities and reddit, helping facilitate AMAs in various subs. She was also a friendly face that listened to mods troubles and helped find solutions or advocate for mods towards the other admins.   She was fired in the middle of her job, with zero support set up to handle the things she previously was handling. Mods were given no heads up, no help to deal with the void she left.   Victoria being fired was more the last straw. Mods were tired of volunteering to run reddit while admins did nothing to support them.   How much these issues have to do with E.P. is left to the speculators."

I've been exposed only to the overflow hyperbolic vitriol and have not had the context of the root underlying cause.   This clip  was posted as a metaphor for the current situation, only seems more appropriate after reading this."
explainlikeIAmA,3c6ako,locallyunscene,2,Sun Jul 5 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"Ellen Pao is the current CEO of reddit and she took on that role in November 2014. She has become something of a scapegoat to reddit users.  Reddit has had and maintains a very hands off approach to administration. This is seen in the lack of mod tools for communication between the admins and the mods, as well as the persistence and growth of racist subreddits. These are not recent things so much as slowly building over the years.  Reddit has become ""home"" to large GamerGate, MensRights/RedPill, and racist communities. I mention these communities together because the former share significant overlapping members and all contain toxic members that spill out into the default communities. It has gotten so bad that the media at large has started noticing.  The exceptions to the hands-off nature have been the notable bannings of subreddits for breaking the few rules reddit has. Previously this was jailbait and thefappening, but more recently this was fatpeoplehate.   Fatpeoplehate was the first banning while Ellen Pao was CEO so loud detractors used it as a pedestal to proclaim her ""SJW-ness"". That sound and fury has mostly died down. k9centipede gave a pretty good overview of why some of the large defaults shut down. Some smaller subreddits used it as a platform to again decry Ellen Pao's ""SJW-ness""."
explainlikeIAmA,3c6ako,lauchs,3,Mon Jul 6 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"I have some biases, but I'll do my best.  I think the place to begin is social justice folks, nicknamed Social Justice Warriors. On reddit, these folks are best exemplified/vilified as /r/shitredditsays. In fact, I'd say a heavy number of people have their first encounter with social justice through these folks. Unfortunately, those interactions tend to run something along the following lines: Person makes obvious joke. SRS misses joke or gets angry about the idea that someone would joke about anything (while SRS folks are wearing clothes made by human slaves, but jokes are the real issue... Sorry.) and this gets echoed in the thread. Meanwhile all the SRS folks tend to ask ""are these people nuts? It's clearly a joke!"" and so social justice leaves a sour taste of insanity in their mouths. So, people are a little worried about the kind of censorship that SJWs/SRSs would impose.  How does this relate to Ellen Pao? For a while, people have been arguing that SRS/SJW people are taking ""control"" or have unfair influence within reddit. While I can't claim to have definitive proof one way or the other, browsing a few of the top posts at /r/subredditcancer can be pretty disturbing (news submissions removed from /r/europe, people being shadowbanned for posting in /r/fatpeoplehate etc.)   Ellen Pao also has a history of social justice moments, like deciding her not receiving a promotion was sexism and suing her company (I believe for the exact amount her husband owes for his role in a ponzi scheme) banning salary negotiations at reddit as she feels they are unfair to women etc.  Is Ellen Pao taking some undue flack? Probably. But, since her leadership, reddit has certainly made some odd moves, that make sense from a social justice perspective (banning /r/fatpeoplehate) and some that just seem very convenient (Victoria being fired the day after allowing the top question to Jesse Jackson to be pretty rabidly anti Jackson).  These moves could simply be business moves, cleaning reddit for mass consumption, but either way, the end game seems like reddit will be sanitized for public consumption. Instead of its freewheeling nature, being a combination of disparate interests, tastes and styles, it seems that edgy or offensive interests, jokes and subreddits may be targeted.   This has people worried. Digg died for similar reasons, other competitors are leaping in to take advantage of reddit's potential implosion.   So, many people, rightly or wrongly, blame Pao."
explainlikeIAmA,3c6cck,ShittyEverything,4,Sun Jul 5 06:38:30 2015 UTC,"And here we have the rudimentary symbol of the Mouse Cult, the three overlapping circles of which represent the belief system's three core concepts: Imagination, Animation and Merchandising.  IMAGINATION  Adherents of the Mouse Cult believe in an idealized reality (often symbolized by or referenced in sacred texts as ""the Magic Kingdom""). It is generally accepted that the physical matter with which people interact is in fact illusory and that existence itself is a predominantly mental phenomenon.   ANIMATION  In order to explore and share phenomenological experiences with fellow believers (i.e to externalize what are fundamentally internal phenomena), the religion's priestly class would set to manipulating various inks and dyes and tree material to produce moving images of these ideas (i.e. animations).   While earlier animations support the idea of a relatively fixed pantheon of demi-gods (the Mouse, being primis inter pares, the Duck, the Fool Dog), worship frequently expanded beyond the canon, often incorporating elements of other traditions, including German Fairy Tales, Greek Epics and Southern US Automotive Worship.  We believe worshippers would use these animations to better understand the universe and would look to them for spiritual guidance and meaning.  MERCHANDISING  It is generally accepted by Mouse Cult scholars that the primary currency with which to pay homage to the pantheon of demi-gods was money (it is believed by some schools that the Mouse's celestial wife, ""Minnie,"" takes her name from a corruption of the word ""money""). While poorer adherents would simply grant tribute in exchange for a fleeting glimpse at the animated truths their spirits craved, wealthier members would craft or purchase expensive plastic totems, frequently featuring the animated demi-gods themselves. This often led to clashes among the faithful, who believed that manifesting what properly belonged to the ideal realm in the physical world was blasphemy. It is sometimes thought the totems were used to teach children."

The line was a lot longer than I expected it would be and by the time I finally got to the ballot I was worrying I'd be late for work. I admit I sort of rushed as I punched the ballot, but I was certain I'd voted correctly (at least for the most important candidates).  Flash forward to an hour ago. I was on my lunch break, bored, waiting for my Stouffer's mac-and-cheese to nuke in the microwave. I noticed that someone had left a ""sample ballot"" on the employee lounge's table so I leafed through it. And guess what? If I'd wanted to vote for Gore I should have punched the hole on the left, not the one on the right!!!  Seriously, WTF?! I started pointing this out to some of my co-workers and one of them said it was a ""butterfly ballot"". According to him I probably voted for that bigoted asshole Pat Buchanan.   Pisses me off. And the thing is, I called my parents to warn them and they both said they'd punched the ballot the same way I did (you know, the logical place to punch!!!). Which means that in theory three votes that should have gone to Gore went to Buchanan instead.  I know it's not that big a deal. I mean, Miami-Dade is a hugely Democratic country here in Florida. I'm sure Gore will carry it. I just hope none of the many elderly in the Jewish community here accidentally F'd up the way I did and voted for that antisemitic jerk Buchanan. :/  Thankfully elections are never decided on just a few votes. It just really annoys me that I fucked up like that you know?!? Next time I vote I'm going to be super careful.  tl;dr: I think I voted for Buchanan today instead of Gore and even though a few votes never decide an election I'm still pissed at myself."

We were attacking the Barbarians near this shit town called Manzikert in the middle of the desert.  My family (the illustrious Doukai) had sent me out here with some soldiers to keep an eye on ol' Romanus; help him if expedient, and stick the knife in if he turned his back.  So this shitheel who doesn't deserve the title of Kaisar, much less Augustus, orders me to guard the camp, and off he goes, chasing these smelly pony-fucking barbarians around in the hot Sun all day.  He can't catch them, of course; they just keep pinging soldiers with arrows and running away like it's a children's game.  But this could only go on for so long.  I'd sat under an awning all day, drinking wine and watching Romanus's antics.  My men were getting bored and restless in the shade of the tents and the Sun was dipping low.  Romanus, seeing the slanting light, ordered the trumpeters to sound the recall.  He formed his battalions up and marched them toward camp.  Then the savages did the damndest thing- as if suddenly possessed, they howled as one like wolves, and rushed the rear of the companies.  Wings of horsemen even broke off from the main host and galloped around to the front!  They had come between the camp, where my soldiers were even then forming up for the rescue, and the Army. But the Emperor and his men stood firm! Despite myself, it was a sight to do a Roman heart proud!  But just then a barbarian arrow reached the heart of the giant Varangian bearing the Imperial Banner, and the purple cloth tottered and fell.  I knew this was my chance.  I filled my lungs to bursting, and bellowed, ""The Emperor is dead! God save us, he has fallen!""  And my men, good simple Roman soldiers all, took up the cry and fled at this obvious sign of God's Wrath. The soldiers in the surrounded Army began to panic, and I knew it was time to get out of there.   By next evening  I was halfway to Constantinople with all of the gold, jewels and silk I could hastily loot from Romanus's tent. But what do you know, right up behind me on a Turkish pony, surrounded by Turkish soldiers, bearing the banners of the Sultan and the Emperor and the white flag of a herald, comes Isaias the Emperor's seneschal.  And I can't believe what he has to say! Turns out the Sultan was craftier than anyone could have imagined, and after sparing the Emperor, he had talked Romanus out of all of his Asian lands in return for his freedom!  I should have saved the rotten bugger after all.    So now I'm here with a dagger in my hand, waiting on the the road in the middle of the night for my living, free and cowardly Emperor.

I hail from Syracuse. They like me here. About a dozen years ago I invented this think called a hydraulic semaphore. I hear from the Fates that you guys call this a telegraph. Ok. Whatever that is. Anyway, I invented that cray shit to help King Hiero II instantly communicate to all his troops when enemies might arrive. I know, pretty cool, right? No more fire pylons that can just only alert to something. Now we can send messages to our soldiers on the other side of the island and quickly move them if shit's 'bout to get real.  Anyway, Hiero II was pretty chill. But he got himself killed. Such a dick, really. His son's a bit of an idiot, too. That's worse. One day, mini Hiero comes up to me and is all like ""Dude dude. We're so fucked. We need your help"". I'm like ""calm down there kid, what's wrong"". Dude tells me he broke the alliance we had with Rome, and not 20,000 legionairs are on their way to go fuck us up and stuff. I hear that and I'm like well fuck, I'm boned. Remember that whole ""I'm smart, look at me, I invented the Hydraulic Sepehmore"" part? Well turns out the Romans know about it, and a few other of my crazy ideas, and they're all like ""Yea, we should totally kidnap this guy and conquer the world"". The Fates tell me this was a classic Pinky and the Brain situation, but I don't know what either of those are, so fuck 'em.  Anyway, I'm like ok. So we have 10,000 men that can instantly know when and where Roman soldiers are with my sepehmores. They have 20,000 men and a hell of a lot of ships. So I sit down and think, and crank some shit out.  First, I invent the Hydraulic Projection Device. The Fates tell me you people call this a ""Canon"".  Second, I invent a Reflective Focuser. The Fates say this is called a ""laser"".  Thirdly, I invent the 'ol Ship smasher. The Fates say nothing like this exists int he future and that I'm fucking stupid for having waisted time on it. I say, how many Romans did I drown with it? They say a lot. I say, fuck you Fates.  I also invent some other crazy shit.  I'm like ""Ok Hiero junior, I made all this crazy shit. Let's do this"".  For 2 years my machines manage this shit like it's nothing. Hundreds of Romans killed whenever they try to breach our wall. Eventually, that Hydralic Sephamore system I created becomes useless, because all we have left are the city walls, but man was it cool to use!  Anyway, 2 years is about as much as we can deal with, and it turns out no matter how many lasers, canons, and smashers you have, you can't stop Roman might. Which really sucks, honestly. Anyway, I'm in my lab doodling away while the city burns and the people are being raped, when suddenly some little shit comes into my lab. He's all like ""who the fuck are you"", and I'm all like ""just stay quiet, pretend he doesn't exist, and he won't hurt you"". Turns out I was wrong. Turns out inventing calculus and making super cool drawings on my chalk board for whatever fucking reason made the soldier angry, and he speared me. That little shit.  Anway, I died. Despite their general wanting me alive, they killed me. The worse part is, that I was inventing this thing the fates say is called a ""computer"", and that little shit stole my prototype! Aparently the General didn't know how to use Syracuse OS v1.1, and just left the machine on his trophy wall. You little fucks. I hope you never learn how to use my hydraulic sephmores, you little shits. Fuck you.  Anyway, it sucks. The Fates tell me I was about 2500 years ahead of my time, and that now the world's going to be pretty sucky and boring. Oh well.

We've already gotten 50 likes and you don't want this to blow up.  Why aren't you doing anything about this? He brags to children about how many recordings he has in his basement. I suspect that he coordinates with the music teacher Mr. Washington to collect recordings of the kids while they're in choir practice. Mr. Washington was also seen coming out of that smelly old music shop by one of the parents, so I suspect he is an audiophile as well.  I expect his immediate dismissal or we'll have to sue the school for endangering our precious children."

I could not fully decode your intelligible preaching over the phone so you know where to ring me. I caught something about your son and how Mr. Norris told him he is an 'actual file""? Not sure what is meant by that, but I'm sure it's of utmost importance to our students and the district so get in touch with me when you can. I'll be at Springfield Junior High until 4:00 pm today.   Tuesday 12:36 pm  Mrs. O'Conner, Principal McDavid returning your call, again.. Seemed to catch me while we celebrating at Red Lobster for Superintendent Waldren's birthday lunch. Unfortunately our love for lobsterfest impeded my answering your call again. I will still be in office until 4:00 pm today, speak with you soon.  Tuesday 1:45 pm  I seem to magically be out of office whenever you call. One of the freshman students thought it was intelligent and very cool to 'pants' another student. They didn't think Saturday detention was that cool that it was worth it. yawn I can sense that you are shocked at the behavior of Mr. Norris and your son Clyde, but I still can not understand what your concern is. Call me back when you can. I'll be here until 4:00 pm.  Tuesday 2:11 pm  Mrs. O'Conner, Conor McDavid from Springfield Junior High again. This telephone tag is going to be a killer, maybe we could get lobsterfest tomorrow and chat, sayyyyy 11:15 pm? Let me know if that works for you.  Tuesday 2:58 pm  No no no ma'am, I was not 'hitting' on you, I'm just a busy man. I aught another student 'swapping spit' in between classes outside of our office. Told the two students that the only spit that can be swapped in this district is the swapping of drool from the mouths of students in Saturday detention. Principal McDavid 2 for 2 Tuesday today! Anyways, your message claims that Mr. Norris is an 'audiophile'. I truly believe the key to our education system is the personal connection our teachers make with our students. Whether it's by their experience in the subject, the sharing of hobbies and- HEY! NO RUNNING IN THE HALLS! Let me call you back...   Tuesday 3:03 pm  Principal McDavid again. 3/3 today. No running to classes on my watch, detention! But what I was saying is that many of our students learn tons from our teachers and their hobbies outside work. In fact, Mr. Norris is not the only audiophile, Clyde's counselor Annie is an audiophile, the shop teacher Mr. Gross, two of the art teachers, and of course Mr. Egger is an audiophile. Mr. Egger really gets our Saturday detention students off with his collection of audiophile equipment. Of course I am too an audiophile. I have my own small set-up for the enjoyment of myself and our secretaries. Sometimes, I have students who will visit my office because of how much they enjoy it with me! I believe that you have nothing to worry about, Clyde is in safe hands and will be resuming his top notch education at Springfield Junior High.  Tuesday 9:47 pm  Mrs. O'Conner, I am just being released from Orange County under detainment for 'the endangerment of children' under your recommendation to Springfield police and Child Services. At the recommendation of my wife and school attorney, I am trying to stay calm in this situation. Tomorrow morning every parent in the district, after sending their children to Springfield Junior High for the day, will read in the newspaper about 'Principal Conor McDavid Detained for False Pedophilia Charges'. I am infuriated that you believed that an audiophile was someone who is 'turned on' and sexually stimulated by students making noises like moans and growls. I believe that you have a formal apology to be written to myself, the faculty, and the District for your unprecedented ignorance. Also, just to spite Clyde- Saturday detention for four weeks. Thank you, and enjoy your day Mrs. O'Conner."

Old Green Grenade Goon is gonna tell you how it really is.   First off, I see you're a Red SMG Goon, that's good. That means you move fast and shoot a lot of bullets. Some poor schmucks have been stuck as Brown Knife Goons for years, who all get gunned down on Street Level I before they get halfway across the screen.  That's what happens when you don't play the union game.   You probably heard guys whispering about Player One, trying to scare you. Player One ain't no scare-story kid. He's real enough. Spiked blond hair, massive pectorals, and thighs like tree trunks, all toting more firepower than a hundred Blue Pistol Goons.   But the good news is, 90 percent of the time, he don't make it past Toxic Sewer Level 2.  Those Gray Sewer Mutants might not be on our side, but when they bum-rush them near the end, it usually ends with him on the ground and the victory countdown playing. Sweetest music you ever heard, kid.   He can still be dangerous though. And don't confuse him with Player Two, the chump with the massive pecs and spiked brown hair.  They may look similar, but Player Two usually dies on Street Level 3. Sometimes Player One gets more guys during the countdown, but seeing that happen with Player Two is more rare than seeing someone who knows the secret jump-jump-kick-duck code.   Me, I got it pretty easy. They gotta get through the Street, Toxic Sewer, and Rundown Docks levels before they get to the Hovercraft Highway levels, where yours truly is. Most of the time, they're too busy dealing with the Yellow Cybercycle Goons to spare a bullet for yours truly. I just chuck my two flashing grenades as they drive by, then clock out until the next shift.   You, you square off with him after that, at Corporate Tower Level 1. Pretty rare he makes it that far, but when he does, he's usually going all the way. Getting shot hurts kid, no two ways about it, you flick in and out of existence, knowing each time you're one step closer to being a drab sprite on the floor. But at the same time it feels right, like you're fulfilling your role.  Does that sound weird?  I only killed Player One once. His bar was low and my grenade landed right in the cockpit of the Hovercraft. Next thing I know, everything freezes and I hear those sweet dirge tones and see the victory countdown. Just felt weird. I was happier just seeing him fly by.  Course, been seeing him less and less these days. Man, in the 80s, we was working double or triple shifts. Now, I see the guy maybe once or twice a week.  I wonder how he's doing.  A lot of the other guys are moving on to home consoles, threedee, going first person, but that ain't for me.  I came in a flat sprite, I'm going out a flat sprite, y'know?  I'll be chucking those grenades til they pull the plug on me.   I see still Player One a lot during the Demo Screen, but it ain't the same, ya know? Like we're both going through the motions, the same moves every time.  Just echoes of what we used to be. Makes you really treasure the real times you get together, when he does something unexpected, like when he figures out he can throw Player Two like a bowling ball.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those crazy religious nuts who worship the guy. Some Goons get really spiritual about the whole thing, claim to find a deeper meaning in ASS, TIT, and 111, but I think you gotta just enjoy the job for what it is.   Anyway, you seem like a good kid, just keep firing that SMG in long chains of exactly five bullets each and you'll do alright."

It protects American interests and businesses as the US beings to implement the 'pivot to Asia'. The US is pivoting to Asia because for the next couple decades all of international economics and finance will be driven by this hemisphere. In this process China plans to become a global power and project its influence - with both money and guns - to ascent and to afix international order that benefits it instead of the US.

So, as I was saying, this is the story of a wizard named Harry Potter. He was a wizard who lived with his aunt and uncle after his parents died. But they treated him bad and stuff, but since they were feeding him, it was their God-given right as Americans, or Englishans, or whatever. The point is, God was involved. Speaking of God, this Harry kid was blessed with magical powers that made him special and whatnot.  One day, he got a letter from this school with other magical kids asking him to go there. Because they were evil, his aunt and uncle didn't want him to go, as they wanted him to continue to mooch off of the government's public school system instead of using good private schools that don't have to teach about safe sex and all that nonsense.  But Harry went anyway and learned that his parents were killed by some evil guy named Voldemort. See, Voldemort was like President Obama but not as bad. Anywho, people were afraid Voldemort would come back, but obviously he wouldn't because he was firmly in hell--you know that place that nana says Washington fat cats should go.  So he is at this government-free private school and learns to play a game called Quidditch that is some gay European sport that isn't worth mentioning. And this Voldemort guy ends up coming back a few times. And darn it, we thought he was dead. But, as you know, that's just God testing Harry's faith. What didn't make sense to me, Trippy, was how he killed him though. He went through all of this hullabaloo about using his wand when he could have just used a gun! What kind of self-respecting American--or whatever he was--doesn't have a concealed weapon. You know what I think? I think that story was written to take place in Obama's third term.

It delivers where all those dating sites you find on porn websites fail, they never tell you where the sexy singles are.   But I didn't want to be too wordy so I kept it short.

His head bobs around, eyebrows raising and falling, as he makes faces of disgust and approval.] [Kelly walks up to Pam.] Kelly: What is Michael doing in there? Pam: I'm not sure, but I think he just discovered Tinder. Kelly: Ew, Michael has Tinder now? Pam: Yeah, why? Kelly: No reason. Do you know if you can block somebody on it? Just out of curiosity. [Dwight yells from his desk.] Dwight: Hey! What are you guys doing? The expense reports are due in [he looks at his watch] exactly two hours and 22 minutes. You can talk about your Pretty Liars show when the little hand is on the 5 and the big hand is on the 12. [Dwight makes a really exaggerated motion with his hands to mimic '5 o'clock' on a clock.] Kelly: Um, first of all, it's Pretty Little Liars. And second of all, didn't Michael leave Jim in charge? Dwight: By default I'm in charge when Michael's not in charge. Doesn't matter what he says. Jim: I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. Dwight: As 'Assistant Regional Ma--' Jim: ""To the Regional Manager”. Dwight: As 'Assistant Regional Ma--' Jim: ""To the Regional Manager”. Dwight: As 'Assistant Regional Ma--' Jim: ""To the Regional Manager"". Is anyone else getting a bad case of deja vu? Dwight: Fine. As second in command, that makes me second in command. Jim:  That’s redundant. And nope. Dwight: Why no--    [Michael cheers from the office, then sprints out the door.]    Michael: Everyone! I have a very important announcement to make! Stop what you're doing! Dwight: But Michael, you made it my job to make sure the expense reports got done by 5:00pm. Michael: 5:00pm tomorrow, Dwight. I lied about the deadline because I know how you like to procrastinate. [Jim gives the camera a Jim-face.] Dwight: But Michael... Michael: Jim, you're in charge when I'm busy, and as you can see...[Michael puts both hands on his phone] my hands are full. So what do you say? Expense reports or my big news? Jim: I'm going to delegate this to the Assistant to the Regional Manager. Is there anyone here with that title? [Everyone in the office looks at Dwight.] Jim: I guess not. Are you sure, Dwight? [Dwight opens his mouth to say something.] Jim: Ah, missed your chance. Let's hear the news, Michael. Michael: Okay, so who here has heard of Tinder?    [A few people in the office raise their hand. Ryan sees Kelly raised her hand and lowers it.]    Michael: Okay, so for all of you cavemen out there, it's this app on the phone that you can download. You download it, and then there are thousands of singles in your area that you have access to. You can swipe left on them--that means you would only do them in the dark with a paper bag on their face--or you can swipe right on them--you know what that means. [He makes a crude gesture.] Phylis: Michael! Michael: Sorry, I forgot we have a 40-year-old virgin in our midst. Phyllis: Michael! Michael: I’m just kidding, I know you’re not a 40-year-old virgin. We went to high school, a lot of people talked. Like a lot of people talked. Anyways, if you like each other, then that's an open ticket to meet up and do things together. But I don't kiss and tell, so you wouldn't hear about that. Kevin: But Michael, when you did it with Jan you emailed everyone a picture of you two. Michael: Thanks, Kevin. How's not having any friends going for you? [After a pause.] I'm sorry, that went too far. Like your reading on the scale. Sorry. I’m just on cloud nine! No filter! Jim: So what's the point of the story? Why were you yelling? Michael: Right! So I got a match! That’s when you get a mental connection with the other person that magical times lie ahead and you both swipe right on each other. And the best part about Tinder? You know it's for real, because you have to sign up through Facebook. You don't have to worry about it being some fat guy behind a computer. I really might have a date with this girl! Jim: What about a skinny guy using his phone in an office? Michael: What? Jim: What if some guy made a profile just to mess with you? Michael: Oh, like people have time to use social media on the job? Jim: Right. [Jim gives the camera another Jim-face.] Michael: I'm going to try and meet her on my lunch back, so if I come back from lunch wearing the same clothes, you know what that means. Sex. Pam: Don't you always come back from a lunch break wearing the same clothes? Michael: Beasley! Look at you, noticing what I'm wearing. Must be a sign. But no, not always. Sometimes my pants are too crotchety. Oscar: Michael, I don't think you're using that word right. Michael: Yeah, well, this girl is only less than a half mile away, so...you know what that means. Her name is Clarissa Dufus, but soon she'll be Mrs. Clarissa Scott. Jim: Right.    [Jim floating head.] Jim: Oh, Michael. [Jim pulls out his phone, shows it to the camera. It's a fake Tinder profile for Clarissa Dufus.] Jim: I finished my expense reports early, figured this was time well spent. And look! A new message from a Mr. Michael Scott. It says, ""hey, you wanta grab launch?"" I think he means he wants to grab lunch. One second, I need to reply to this. [Michael is standing behind Jim, on the other side of the glass. From his desk, Dwight is peering over at Jim.] Jim: I said ""sure. what's for dessert?"" [Behind Jim, Michael jumps excitedly. While that happens, Jim shows the phone to the camera. Dwight points at Jim and Michael looks over at Jim. His face scours as he sends a message.] Jim: Oh look, another message! ""I don't think you can handle the sweet tooth."" Ah, Michael, if I was single... [Michael is now standing right behind Jim as he types a response. Jim looks up at the camera guy in the middle of sending the message.] Jim: What? [Jim looks behind him. Michael and Dwight are looking down at him through the glass, not happy.] Jim: Oh."

For instance, can gay people marry other gay people? Will this lead to polygamy, bestiality, and the fall of modern civilization? If I'm not gay, am I still allowed to be married?

explainlikeIAmA,3bgyva,gcpizzle23,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"I'm ignorant on economy and world affairs so... Whatever... Here's my attempt:  --- U.S. is Mr. Monopoly ---  You own Boardwalk and Park Place (no houses or hotels), Mediterranean Ave and Baltic Ave with hotels in each of them. You also own The Short Line Railroad, Pacific Ave and North Carolina Ave; these are all mortgaged because you used the money to buy Boardwalk and Park Place since you ran out of money by the time you landed on them; blame this on landing too many times on LUXURY TAX and INCOME TAX, spending ridiculous amounts of money paying other players because of Chance and Community Chest (welfare, bribes for electing you Chairman of the Board), and on the rare chance that you do get some money from those cards it's always something stupid and insignificant like $10 for winning a beauty pageant or something. You have a mustache and are BALD! You know you aren't winning any beauty pageants anywhere (foreign policy, world image). Nobody likes you with you with your excessive lifestyle of wearing monocles and top hats (uncontrollable spending), your cigar smoking (drug abuse), driving around in your fast Race Car. But you're Mr. Monopoly and own fleets of Battleships, Cannons and Cavalry, you are at the center of the world financial  spotlight with your Trains and Railroads (Pacific Trade). We get it: you are important, but no one really likes you. The rest of the world is just scared because you're crazy, drunk, high, and got tons of guns. Token: Battleship (military prowess, aggressive and imposing character).   You're playing against China, Europe, Latin America, Russia, India, and Japan:   China: Illinois Ave, Indiana Ave, Kentucky Ave; all with hotels. New York Ave Tennessee Ave St. James Place; all with hotels. The Pensilvania Railroad (no mortgage), and Pacific Ave. Token: Wheelbarrow (manual labor). Acquired Red monopoly from Russia by paying a very large amount of money for Kentucky and Indiana Ave; They landed on Illinois. Acquired Orange monopoly by negotiating very early in the game with Latin America (St. James Place, Tennessee Ave) and India (New York Ave, The Pensilvania Railroad). Statistics, strategic long term investments, and maintaining a good relationship with the other players favor this player.  Europe: Marvin Gardens (3 houses), Ventnor Ave (2 houses), Atlantic Ave (2 houses). Token: Boot (fashionable appearance, 'gave the boot' to the people who eventually gave birth to the US). Landed on all its property. They'll survive for a long while, but will eventually lose because they thought they thought they were smarter than every other player and could take advantage of them. They've been struggling to raise hotels on their properties, but because landing on the other player's hotels which are better located (Europe hates paying Latin America because this is where they land the most) and players don't land as often on theirs making their cash flow very unstable and is seen buying and selling houses constantly. They're playing, but won't really affect the outcome of the game. No chance of winning. Will be butt hurt if he loses.    Latin America: Connecticut Ave, Vermont Ave, Oriental Ave. All with hotels, nice to look at with its sky blue shade. Doesn't really bother any player except Europe. Every one visits them because of their geographical location, but no really wants to live there. They also own The Redding Railroad (Panamá Canal) which even if you don't want to go through it you'll have to anyways because it's right there. Token: Dog (you go where the treats are, looks for the safeguard of more powerful nations). Blessed with pure luck (landed on all its properties) and charisma. They're just playing for the experience and for fun, but won't last long even though they always land on FREE PARKING and the lottery rule is in place; taxes paid by US are given to them for no reason other than landing there (think Cubans). They don't really care too much even though they're loud as fuck celebrating when you land on their hotels and will put a curse on you and your children if they land on your property and have to pay $8.00 in rent.   Russia: Water Works. Token:. Bag of Money (extravagant culture, a lot of oil money). Hates everyone, but no one more than the Battleship. It rather sell everything to Wheelbarrow than to Battleship. Made a ton of money by selling to Wheelbarrow which explains why they can last as much as the do in the game. Battleship is proud of the fact that Money Bag has no assets besides a shit ton of cash which Battleship envies so much! Shady player, probably with a few $500 bills hidden under the board so that no one can asses their real worth; also probably stole some without the bank noticing. Could still make good money of Water Works (natural resources) should shit hit the fan, this will keep it in the game longer, but will eventually lose anyway, like Loki.  India: The B & O Railroad. Token: Train (have you seen how crowed their trains get?!). Would have won the game by great margin IF they had Battleship's properties, but wasted too much time following Europe's advice and now is too late for them.  Japan: Electric Company. Token: Thimble (ancient, practical, efficient, smart, strong willed, self sustainable: doesn't rely on anything else in order to function like the Battleship needs fuel/oil to move). Wishes it was just them and Battleship 50/50 on the board so they could then make a winning move against Battleship only to forget why US is Battleship in the first place and get their asses handed to them.    Results: 1st.  China. Will be smirk about it, get drunk and rub it on US's face all night while being annoying.   2nd.  U. S. A. Will lose everything to China because of their uncontrollable spending, greed, shopping and desire to show off. Will get pissed at China for winning and will get annoyed by them. Will get drunk and try to pick a fight with China later that night.   3rd.  Russia. Having big balls can get you far in life and no one has bigger balls than Russia. Will call every one the rest of the night a pussy  4th. Europe. Sad it lost, but tries to hide it. Tries to break China and US fight. Expectedly, it failed at doing this.  5th. Latin America. Doesn't care about losing because he's been eyeing and flirting all night with your sister and couldn't wait for the game to be over to go talk to her.   6th.  India. Not because of lack of skill, but because they tried to copy the gaming style of some of the oher players instead of doing its own thing.   7th.  Japan. Couldn't care less about the game because they still make a better cars than the US.   Edit: I forgot about the part where Mr. Monopoly didn't know the world outside of monopoly and instead adapted a game night. Sorry for screwing it, but I'm not re-writing it. Shit's too long!"

I set high goals, and one of them includes building my own space ship. After all, if you want to touch the moon, you've got to make the ship to leave the atmosphere. Unfortunately, you won't be paid for being an astronaut, but a high-level internship will provide invaluable experience.  Becoming an astronaut takes long hours and a lot of dedication. I know that dedication may not be a problem, but if you cannot handle the hours, there's little I can do for you.  Finally, we need to test you when you're without gravity.

I know, in the greater context of things, when you simplify everything down so it fits in your little labeled black and white moral boxes, I guess I'm the bad guy.  Right?  I get it.  To be a successful dictator, you have to pull off some pretty spectacular - you might say terrible - stuff in order to stay in charge, and of course the media is just going to highlight all the controversies.  Do you know how many times people have tried to assassinate me? Oy vey. Like people I thought were my friends tried to have me stabbed in the back, literally, like Caesar or that asshole Trotsky.  I mean, even before having to stare down your ray gun thingy?  You know like, message received, guy, gee whiz.  But you have to take into consideration what I've been dealing with here.  The guys before me were all pretty decadent and wasteful in a country where people had to burn their currency for heat, because A., their money was that worthless and B., they were fucking cold.    I'm sorry, I need a moment, I'm getting a little verklempt.  Nobody had jobs, there was no industry, we had food shortages and a generation of war orphans, on top of an inescapable national debt due to war reperations we have to pay because we got dragged into a big whole stupid thing because a bunch of rich people were arguing about whether or not to screw each other for thirty generations.  The kaiser was so desperate he had the genius idea to rake the goddamn sea for particles of gold.  Asshole.  So maybe I used the Jews as a scapegoat for all our problems.  Sure, I sent a bunch of them to die, but I don't know if you noticed or anything, but there's kinda been a mounting anti-semitism problem in Europe for about 1900 years.  It would have spilled over one way or the other, and by putting all our problems on cynical banking structures that indebted people in interest schemes that were inescapable, I united the poor, suffering German people against our common foe.  Alright, foes.  Alright, almost the entire rest of the world except for Japan and Italy.  But also sometimes Italy.  Things got out of hand, alright?  I didn't want to fight everyone at once - I mainly was picking fights with small countries with no standing armies and no terrain advantages, or getting into border disputes with peacenik spineless politicians.  This whole thing would be well behind us a long time ago, but I underestimated Stalin's capacity to send wave after wave of his own men to die of starvation or hypothermia.  I figured he'd show a little compassion and just fold, and then we'd go back to being best buds, laugh about all this at me and Eva's wedding, maybe he'd pretend to lose the rings to get back at me a little.  You know, fun?  Noooope - that motherfucker was so PO'd he would've thrown every last potato in the country at my soldiers.  If you ask me, that guy's the real psychopath - he's the one you should be after, probably gonna kill waaaay more people than I ever will.  Fershtay?  Oh, and those stupid Japs.  I had France under my heel, Britain was getting ready to break, and then Japan brings America into the fight.  I mean, what the fucking fuck?  Learn to manage your goddamn aggro, Reloy.  They're gonna get atom bombed, right? Good, little bastards deserve it.  Wait, two times?  Come on, that's over the line, is that really necessary?  Anyway, you've read my book?  All I was saying is, socialism's great, the industrial era is great, Ford cars are great, nach a mool, and if we all work together, we can do anything.  Now is that so bad?  For example - you got here in a time traveling rocket.  Well guess who needed a way to deliver ordinance into Britain without challenging their navy?  This guy, rockets are all me, baby.  You smell that fresh country air?  It's because I put restrictions on big tobacco.  You like movies in your century?  I love movies, especially the ones where my soldiers make snowball fight forts out of Russian bodies.  Have you benefited from advances in pharmaceuticals, surgery, neuroscience, fertility medicine?  Well shake my hand and say thank you, all that shit was my people advancing science because - er, eh, let's not focus on why all those awesome accomplishments were made right now.

Suddenly, the lights dim, and a spotlight shines on both himself and on Phil, a waiter. A voice booms from overhead.  Announcer: LADIES, GENTLEMEN, AND THOSE OF INDETERMINATE GENDER. PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER FOR SCOTT STERLING, THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE L-  Phil (yelling): It's Steiner!  Announcer: Oh. That's significantly disappointing.  Scott: Hey!  A (recovering): GROUPS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, MASH YOUR HANDS TOGETHER VIGOUROUSLY FOR SCOTT STEINER, THE WORLD'S SECOND BEST HEAVY-WEIGHT WRESTLER.  Phil starts waving his arms in a worm-like motion, while mouthing repeatedly 'Oh my God. Oh my God,' as he approaches Scott.  A: WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY? ARE YOU SAYING 'ANNOUNCER, YOU BEAUTIFUL AND TASTEFULLY EROTIC MAN, I ALWAYS THOUGHT SCOTT STEINER WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR!  Yogi Bear, who happened to be seated in the cafe, flips his table over, flips off the announcer, who is clearly the overweight cashier unable to conceal his entire body underneath the front counter, and leaves in a huff.  A: AND IF YOU THOUGHT THAT BEAR WAS NETTLED, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE JUST HOW IRKED MR. STERLING WILL BECOME WHEN HE TAKES ON OUR CAFE'S TWO-TIME CHAMPION, PHIL ""THE PHILLIP"" PHILLIPS! BUT FIRST, LET'S HEAR WHAT OUR CHALLENGER HAS TO SAY!  Another waiter hastily dashes out and hands Scott a microphone.  S: I'm confused and uncomfortable about this whole thing.  The whole crowd chants 'OH SHUCKS, SHOTS FIRED, OH SHUCKS, SHOTS FIRED, until Phil raised his hands. The microphone is yanked from Scott's hands and handed to Phil.  P: They tell me you're the best of the best. That there's nobody and nothing around that can possibly touch you. But let me tell you, sonny-boy, you ain't nothing - NOTHING - compared to the great good that marriage equality will do this country.  Ashokan Farewell starts playing at a tastefully aggressive volume.  P: Marriage equality, to put it concisely in the most appropriate terms, is the dopest shit. You think you can put me in the hospital, but what good will that do when my husband can still see me there?  The rest of the crowd recoils from this sick diss.  P:  Or what about when I can safely assume that my husband can look after my kids in the event that you can absolutely kick my teeth in.  As these pieces of fire keep slapping people's ear-holes like an inconsiderate dragon with a lisp, people start spasming due to overwhelming hype.  P: In short, thanks to marriage equality, I. AM. IMMORTAL.  Phil lunges at Scott, and Scott reflexively punches him in the gut before any of Phil's flailing gestures lays a finger on him. He curls over on the floor. Fozzie Bear, Phil's husband, rushes to his side.  P: Hold me. Everything's going dark.   Fozzie: Don't worry. It'll all be alright. After-all...  Fozzie Bear turns to the camera.  Fozzie: I love you BEAR-y much.  Fozzie lets go of Phil, and flashes jazz hands at the camera. Phil perishes where he lands."

If there was enough draw on a cigarette to get the tip hot enough to light the vapors (its vapors not the fluid that causes explosions) then it is possible to light a fire with a cigarette.   Throwing a cigarette into the gas will extinguish the cigarette.    A lit cigarette is not hot enough to light the fumes (usually).    A cigarette that is being drawn on, while around heavy fumes, does get hot enough to light fumes.    Sources:    Had a grandfather who liked to really screw with people and kept a open top can of gas around specifically for doing so.

Then Jesus died so he could go to Hell and rescue them, opening a path for the ones who believed in him and his word to escape (not the ones who were less sinful than others, only the ones who specifically believed in him, regardless of amount of sin). That is how the story goes, according to the scriptures.  It astounds me how anyone could honestly believe that verbatim.

Their cars are going to DRIVE THEMSELVES TO YOU! They don't even need a fucking cab driver! What the fuck is this!? I need your help man! Remember how somebody shot the Life Invader CEO and their stocks tanked? Could you do that do Uber's boss? No... You can't. You're in hiding... Plus you are doing good by not getting caught, and I can't bowl with a dead cousin heh heh heh.   I took out 100,000 grand from these very trustworthy investors so I can give my Taxi business a big boost. Nobody is ever going to want a car that drives itself to pick them up! That's unsafe! Ah who am I kidding... The investors seemed great and all! They just want me to pay them back $150,000 and do it in a year... They make a joke about cutting my head off if I didn't pay them back. They're so funny right? Hahaha. I already spent $30,000 gambling trying to make the big bucks! Mallorie is telling me to put that money into the company but if I win the jackpot then I won't ever have to worry about money AGAIN! I'm so fucked Niko. I can't stop gambling and I need you to visit and help me. I have a nice place set up and an extra room for you. I promise no roaches this time.

Poor little Harry couldn't handle Voldy's mighty load, so his hot ginger mom took it instead.  Then Harry grew up and, after taking a pounding from the Dursleys, got rescued by Ron Jeremy (or Hagrid). He went to Hogwarts, a sexy wizard school where sexy wizard stuff happens. Once he got there, Harry had to choose - which sexy wizard man is the hottest?  Everyone was totally pining after Harry. There was Draco, who was OBVIOUSLY MEANT TO BE WITH HARRY THE WHOLE TIME ASDFGHK SEXUAL TENSION. Even Ron and Dumbledore got in on the action, and snape like totally wanted to but he was like omg no he's Lily's son like omg wtf snape you pleb.  So Harry had to choose one of the guys to marry, and a bunch of other wizard shit happened but lol who the fuck cares about that anyway.

I attempted to put clothes on, but just couldn't make it past throwing them around the room.  After my exercise of running up and down the stairs for another hour, I made it to the corner of the living room where I began my ""in motion meditation"". I've found that I need to repaint the corners of my walls from excessive use.  Once I was able to make it to the door, I was compelled to enter and re-enter through it for several times before admiring the facing on my house. I began today's journey just as every other day, standing awkwardly near people and bumping into everything that moves... or stands still.   Once I made it into the strangers house and accosted them as to what their favorite animal was, I admired their walls. They have a lovely paint scheme. I spent the next 4 hours in their house as they sat and watched me. Once leaving Mr. McAlister's house, great man, I found my self pacing. I'm sure that I had forgotten something. When it hit me! The tree! I had forgotten about the tree, I need to then show affection to every tree along my route.  As I arrived to the Walmart in the neighboring city, I was taken into custody. It appears that people were just not ok with me rubbing my junk all over their tree's and cars. As I was in the police car, I kept getting yelled at by my imaginary friend Dr. Maple about how the door was locked.  I was escorted to the booking room where I admired their walls. They were blue and grey.   I ended my night by ramming my face into the door and having 1/3 of my money removed from my account for blacking out.   GG"

explainlikeIAmA,3aoiq0,samuraisports37,5,Mon Jun 22 05:19:31 2015 UTC,"Basketball.  If you're like me, you have very little interest in large sweaty men running around trying to force a ball into a hole.  No thank you, I'm British.  However, for America in general, basketball is big.  It's a cultural phenomenon, being one of the ""big three"" sports in the US.    (Montage of people saying how great basketball is)    It's also big business.  The NBA finals this year averaged nearly twenty million television viewers in the US alone.  Winning the final is estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars for the winning team, from ticket sales, endorsements, and merchandising, et cetera.    Little wonder, then, that all of the teams in the NBA really, really want to win.  They want it more than that little boy screaming in the aisles at Toys 'R Us about the newest Pokemon game (insert graphic of a screaming boy), and how he absolutely has to have it, and why don't you just shut up, you little shit?  When I was your age all I had to play with was a polyurethane bottle and I liked it!    Over the course of NBA history, some teams have been more joy than others.  Some have built successful dynasties by winning multiple championships in a row (graphic of the Lakers logo), and others... less so.  (graphic of the Wizards logo)    In the eighties and nineties, of course, the team to beat was the Chicago Bulls.  Back then, they had a well balanced team consisting of Michael Jordan, and everybody else.    (insert photoshopped image of Pippen, Rodman, Kukoc, Grant, etc looking angry)    Okay, okay, the other guys were important too.  For example, Toni Kukoc proved that it was possible to be a good NBA player while looking stoned all the time.  (insert graphic of Kukoc)  Rodman showed that being a dominant force on the hardwood did not mean you couldn't show your feminine side off of it, either.  (insert image of Rodman in a wedding dress)  Personally I'd say he looks better there than every member of the Kardashian family.  Such flowing locks!  Exquisite!    Having given them their due, though, there's no denying the fact that Jordan was the dominant force in the NBA while he was playing with the Bulls.  He brought the city of Chicago six championships, which allowed the city to boast about having more than just wind and O'Hare Airport.  Jordan led the NBA in scoring for ten seasons, he was a five-time NBA MVP, fourteen-time all star, and was selected to the All-NBA team eleven times.  The only way he could've won more was if he had compromising photos of the NBA commissioner at the time.  (insert photoshopped image of David Stern in lingerie)    But all of this only happened because of a colossal blunder, all the way back in 1984.  On June 19 of that year, the annual NBA draft was held in New York.  The top three picks went to the Houston Rockets, the Portland Trail Blazers, and the Chicago Bulls.  Houston picked Hakeem Olajuwon, who went on to enjoy a very successful career with the Rockets, being universally seen as the player with the most punnable name ever.  At least until Jeremy Lin came around.  (insert a Lin-sanity graphic)    The Trail Blazers, however, picked Sam Bowie.  And if you're saying ""Who?"" then you're not alone.  Sam Bowie these days is pretty much known as ""the guy who wasn't Michael Jordan.""  Bowie, of course, was not a terrible player, but he wasn't at Jordan's standard.  And it's worth acknowledging that the Blazers had their reasons for picking him.  Chiefly among them was that they already had a good shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, and it was believed that having Jordan and Drexler on the same team would never work.    (insert graphic of Dream Team 1, with gold medals around their necks)    Unfortunately for Sam Bowie, he won absolutely nothing in the NBA, averaging just under eleven points a season.  Ten injury-plagued seasons later, Bowie finally put his legs out of their misery and retired from the NBA.  In contrast, Jordan went to the Bulls in the third pick of the 1984 draft, and everything else is, as they say, history."

With anger and smoke they played games, never daring to stoop to the violence they so desired. They played games of manipulation and games of deceit, always waiting for the advantage.   And Lo, it came. For on the isle so cursed by its blessing, mankind arrived. And man brought his curiosity, and with it man poked holes. They clawed at the earth and demanded it surrender whatever strange power it held, but the earth refused. And when man grew strong, the island shut its eyes and remembered, and in its memory it changed. It erased that which displeased it and made that which it wanted. Man brought much death to the island, and the island remained steadfast.   For, though man fought and warred for the island, and though man was persistent in his endeavors, man was weaker than the creature of smoke. The minds of man bent and were broken by the island, but out of this mindforge grew a new thought, and the island was hailed. The creature of smoke was defeated, and the island chose a time to remember. In time, all men of the island passed away, but each in their time to happiness.   And heed this, brutha's, for this is our cause! Though your mind may be bent, your thoughts twisted, your rationality crushed, the island in the end will reward you. Dwell on questions of polar bears, consider different times, past, present, future, and sideways, and above all remember this. If one faces the island, he must do so with his brutha's!

This means that they will be forced to compromise and have coalitions with other parties, which is arguably a good thing because it means different political parties can have their voice heard.  In New Zealand, for example, the Green Party commands 11% of the vote. While this is nowhere near enough to lead the nation, they are still the 3rd largest party and their support in parliament is sought after by Labour and National, the top two contenders. To gain the support of the Green party, it means these other parties will listen to the Green party politicians and concede on certain environmental points or help them push various bills in exchange for help in another.  Instead of a party with 11% of seats in parliament being worthless, that 11% becomes a very valuable amount to convince and persuade and bargain with."

Such a coalition, of course, would be a ""liberal"" coalition.  The end result is still a polarized political landscape.  I'm not saying it always ends up like this, but it's always a possibility and at least in some places (Israel, for instance) a reality."
explainlikeIAmA,3a1yi8,AGVann,7,Tue Jun 16 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"those third parties aren't always neutral in terms of liberalism and conservatism   That's because politics is (and should be) so much more than just 'liberal' or 'conservative'.

What about those that want equal gender and sexuality rights, but believe in restricting immigration? Who do the socially 'conservative' but fiscally 'liberal' vote for?

While that's possible, it's unlikely because there are no formal laws or rules around joining or leaving coalitions. If the opposing bloc can offer a minority party a better deal, then they will leave.   Speaking of coalitions, don't you think fringe groups like the tea party would refuse to form a coalition with a socially liberal but fiscally conservative faction? Both are conserative parties in name, but only because binary labels are insufficient. There is a million degrees of difference the two and no reason for them to ever form a coalition.

Well Democrats hate Friedman and love those programs.  Democrats think that Friedman advocates creating major cataclysmic acts so that change can happen.  Democrats think that the big government programs are great, because in their mind, they're run by Josh Lyman and Toby Ziegler and CJ Cregg, and not by people like Frank Underwood, which is a more realistic depiction of the greedy power-hungry bureaucrats that exist in the State Department.    And you know how you think that you should be able to spend the money you make the way you want to?  Well Democrats hate that too, because you don't spend it the way they want.  And they went to Harvard and Yale, so obviously they know better how you should spend your money than you should.  So they'll take it and spend it on wars you don't want to fight, foreign aid that's going to dictators, social programs that create more gigantic government programs that suck up money while actually doing nothing, and creating a healthcare system that's so ill-conceived and poorly run that people who actually need can't get through the confusion and end up being taxed by the same government that tried to help them.  Democrats are obsessed with fixing market failures, to use a Friedman-esque term.  Some of the market failures are easy, like creating tolls on highways, or pollution taxes on companies.  Some of the market failures are harder, like health care.  But they see small European countries with efficient health-care systems and socialist governments and say ""We can do that!"", while forgetting that they're in a country that's 10 times the size of the European countries population-wise, and 40 times the land mass, which creates infrastructure problems they didn't see, but write off as your fault because you blocked their plans up and took their bills down.  They also don't see the tax rates in the European countries as upwards of 40% in England (if you are middle class), 45% in Germany plus an additional 5.5% income solidarity tax, and anywhere between 49% and 60% in Sweden (the country whose healthcare system Democrats tried to emulate and often point to as the beacon for a socialist state).  They forget that our tax rates are between 10% and 39.6%, lower than any European country, and yet want to maintain these tax rates while spending trillions on government plans they can't afford.  But at least they get to feel good about themselves for helping us regular Americans who don't know how to do anything, so much as spend our money, feed and clothe ourselves, create jobs and businesses that give them money to do their programs.

They both agree that funding foreign terrorist organizations is okay so long as it benefits US interests. They both agree that the US can invade countries on fraudulent terms for oil wealth and geostrategic influence. Both parties agree that the US is the best nation on Earth and that the rights recognized by the Constitution as pertaining to all men equally pertain, in fact, only to United States citizens. They both agree that subsidizing high finance, even hacking other nations to manipulate economic results, is good for America even if it exacerbates wealth disparity. Both agree that American citizens can be killed without a jury if they are not located inside the United States and if they publicly pronounce bad things about the country. Both Democrats and Republicans believe that the national security interests of the United States - the ones that make a certain class of its people rich - are more important than the civil rights of its citizens.

That said, those who choose to represent us, that is a different story.  Those folks share more in common with each other, than they do with us.

And then other merchandising will come online six to twelve months after that.  Absolutely spectacular roadmap!  Spared no expense!    GENNARO:  We can charge anything we want.  Fifty bucks for a DVD, one hundred for a Blue-ray, and people will pay it.  And then there's the merchandise...   HAMMOND:  Donald, Donald, this movie was not made only to cater to the super-rich, everyone in the world has the right to enjoy this movie.    GENNARO:  Okay, sure, we'll have a discount day or something.    MALCOLM:  (grimly)  The lack of respect for the customer that's being displayed here... staggers me.    GENNARO:  (snidely)  Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different than you and I have feared.    MALCOLM:  Yeah, I know, they're a lot worse.    GENNARO:  Now wait a second, we haven't even watched the movie yet.    HAMMOND:  Now, Donald, Donald, let him talk.  I want to hear every viewpoint, I really do.    MALCOLM:  Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Movie sequels are the most powerful force force the industry's ever seen, but you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.    GENNARO:  It's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations...   MALCOLM:  (cutting him off)  Excuse me, if I may... I'll tell you the problem with the cinematic power that you're using here.  It didn't require any originality to attain it.  You know, you saw a movie that's been made before, and you took the next step.  You didn't earn the first movie's acclaim yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it.  You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to make as much money as you could, and before you even know what you had, you trademarked it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunch box, and now you're selling it, you want to sell it...   HAMMOND:  I don't think you're giving us our due credit.  Our movie crew's done things that've never been done before.    MALCOLM:  Yeah, yeah, but your crew was so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should!    HAMMOND:  The Dark Knight!  The Dark Knight deserves a sequel with Heath Ledger's Joker.  If I was to create a movie series based on the Joker, you wouldn't have anything to say.    MALCOLM:  No, hold on, this wasn't a movie series that was prematurely ended by the death of its actor, or getting axed by the studio, Jurassic Park had its chance, and the moviegoers selected it for extinction.    HAMMOND:  I simply don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a movie lover.  I mean, how could we stand in the path of a potential blockbuster, and not act?    MALCOLM:  Oh, what's so great about a blockbuster?  It's based on popularity and marketing anyway.  What you call a blockbuster, I call the rape of the moviegoer.    ELLIE:  Well, the question is, how can you know anything about a past movie series?  And therefore, how can you assume you can make a good movie based on it?  You have dinosaurs in this movie that make no sense!  You picked them because they look good.  But these are integral parts of the movie that will seem out of place if used wrong - violently, at times.    HAMMOND:  Dr. Grant.  If there's one person here who can appreciate what I'm trying to do...    GRANT:  The movie industry's changed so radically and we're all running to catch up.  I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look... 1993 and 2015, two periods separated by twenty two years of movie evolution, are suddenly thrown back in the mix together.  How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?    HAMMOND:  (laughs)  I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!  You're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters, and the only one I've got on my side is the bloodsucking movie executive!    GENNARO:  ... thank you.    (Later, everyone's sitting in cars outside the T-Rex paddock)    MALCOLM:  Man makes movie.  Man makes movie sequels.  Movie sequels destroy man.  Different man makes different sequel.    ELLIE:  Different sequel eats man... woman reboots the franchise."

It could connect you with anything.  Then all those 'experts' started telling you of all the evil things that your computer could get.  Viruses, malware, botnetness...  Of course you don't want anything to happen to your precious little computer so you ask them what to do.  You know what, THEY CAN""T AGREE.  First it is install AGV, then it is McAfee (he is crazy you know), Norton for this, and don't forget about the regular UPDATES!    As soon as they tell you that this big nasty thing is going around and you should make sure you have all of the latest stuff plus the updates and nothing ever happens.  I remember putting my computer in the back yard incase it blew up with that 2000 bug and nothing happened.  Nothing ever happens.  Now my friends mother is still taking care of her first computer.  The thing has to be at least 15 years old and it can barely function on facebook.  You know what, it came PRE-LOADED with ""ANTI-VIRUS"" software.  She is going to be paying people to work on that computer for THE REST OF HER LIFE.  So you just think about that.  Maybe you can just ditch a computer every few years and get a new one because it's ""slow"" or ""not top of the class"" but I care and I'll never subject my computer to the big anti-virus elites."

Download a program that will mess with your computer and slow it down to stop programs from messing with your computer and slowing it down? Sounds like you just gave yourself a virus!  But going into it then you have all those companies that tell you that you need their anti-virus, and that theirs is the best. Are any of them trustworthy? YOU DONT KNOW!  Let me tell you, I have heard some horror stories. McAfee users who are unable to remove it no matter what, whose computers are all moving at a snail's pace. Norton users who pay through the nose to make their computer unable to run any programs. And those are stories about legitimate antivirus software! It gets far worse in the wilds of the internet.   The worst part is that people get viruses all the time, even if they HAVE an antivirus, so what is even the point?  Far better to just use good computer practices and use ad-block, since most viruses use ads to get in anyway.

Hear me out.  My computer was running fine.  Browsing the web at top notch speed.  His processor was top of the line.  He used his modem better than any other computer I have ever seen.  Then, I bought his antivirus software and it all went down hill.  Now every time he would try to send messages or play with other applications he would have to check with his own firewall.

On another note, you can get a virus from just about any website that has advertisements.  Ads aren't hosted one the site you're looking at.  Each ad is basically a small window to a different website.  Sometimes those other websites are malicious or sometimes they have been compromised.  That's reason enough to use an ad-blocking plugin.

If I don't want to run an antivirus then that's my choice and I accept the risk.  If you really care about your computer then you wont use an antivirus either. There have been numerous studies that antivirus software makes your computer... well you know... slow. There's no real guarantee that they'll actually work too, the really dangerous viruses are the ones that still undiscovered -- and don't give me any of the ""heuristic analysis"" bullshit, that's just corporate marketing speak for bad guessing.  Antivirus software also make people think they're secure when they're not. Would you download that shady looking attachment if you knew you didn't have any protection? Obviously not! But when you are using an antivirus you might think to yourself, ""well what's the worst that could happen I've got an antivirus!"" When your 14 year son is looking for boobies on the internet  and tries to download xXx_Taylor-Swift-Uncut_xXx.mp4.vid.zip.pdf.run.exe and clicks through every single warning and installs it anyway what was even the point of the antivirus?  But the worst part is that antivirus software is worse than the viruses themselves. No! Fuck you AVG I don't want to upgrade to your double platinum premium tier for ""only"" $59.98/yr, I'd rather just look at the sexy singles in my area, at least those are entertaining. And yes McAfee I would like to install the Tor Browser -- I know it's not signed by Microsoft -- look, I have more faith in the community Web of Trust than I do with Microsoft anyway.  As long as we're smart about our online habits, update our systems regularly, only install software from trusted sources, and don't fall for obvious phishing and malware attempts then there's no reason we can't use our natural common sense and be just as safe as those who think that the annoyance and slowdowns are worth a little false security."

You'll be one case of carpal tunnel or an RSI from being unemployed and without any employable skills.  Almost every professional athlete encounters horrendous issues managing their finances, and if you don't learn how to avoid those issues, you'll be living off of welfare by the time you're 30.

I googled it, can't really say at a glance if that has a serious future or not. But I did think to google the amount of people playing this game you mentioned.  That's a lot of people. I'm going to guess that the majority of those people don't play professionally. You know this reminds me of someone a few years back. James Atwood, you remember him? He was a big man in the school, Varsity Football captain. Do you know what he's doing now? Not football. It's competitive and the time commitment grinds at you.   I imagine it's much the same with this, uh, e-sports. Even if you are as good as you say you are, you will have to get lucky to get noticed, just to get on a team that will let you use these skills in a career. It's rolling the dice...  Well, I don't know, well more than a twenty-sided die... Yeah a lot more than one-hundred sided dice, they make those? Must look like golf-balls...  Right, we're getting off track. Point is that if this is your dream, you should go for it. But you have to know that the odds are not in your favor. That's why I suggest, if you don't want to do college, which honestly employment prospects out of college being somewhat dismal now anyways, you should try to get into a skilled trade.   ... You don't have to be a plumber or a construction worker. You could learn to be a welder, or air-craft mechanic. Those are in very high demand almost everywhere. A solid welding license can get you work visas all over the world if you really want to travel too.   Most of these programs take less than half the time that a four-year degree would, and there are many institutions that let you take classes part-time. That would let you spend time pursuing this, e-sports career, while you're getting useful life skills while paying a fraction of what most colleges will ask for.   And if it looks like this e-sports thing can work out, then good, you have a nice skill that you can use towards a neat hobby. Plus y'know if there's an apocalypse it's nice to have applicable skills like that, right? Haha.   But seriously, if the e-sports thing doesn't work out, which I hope it does, don't think of these skilled trades as a career. Just think of them as something you can do for the moment before you find out what you would really like to do."

So, Chaos theory doesn't necessarly contradict this, but it states that sufficiently complicated systems will amplify any inaccuracies or rounding errors. So... chill, dude. I'm getting to it.   So, if I'm trying to predict, yes, the weather, and I start with a wind speed of, say 4.33728 miles per hour, but the real wind speed is 4.33727622438731865248 miles per hour because you and your... sigh Lepidazi minions... flapped your wings at the right time, the difference between my prediction and the real system can, after a relatively short time, be so great that my model could show a calm day in Kansas when there's really a tornado.

No, I'm not denigrating  the 'glory' of Adolfus hitlerpedes or Josef Monarchele or whatever you're calling yourself today. What I'm saying is that because the system is inherantly unpredictable, you and your buddies could just as easily prevent a hurricane that I predicted by the same interference.

His leadership quality ranged somewhere between bumbling nincompoop and addlepated twit. After his wife died he became singularly focused on his (gorgeous) daughter and marrying her off to the highest bidder, neglecting the rampant poverty of the city surrounding his palace.   In my free time I quested after an elusive ""magic lamp"" so I could right the wrongs of the Sultan. I found a clever witted boy with great parkour skills and sent him into the Cave of Wonders to retrieve the lamp. This is where everything went horribly wrong. The street rat was buried alive with the lamp after his sidekick monkey (whole other issue) touched a piece of treasure inside the cave after I specifically told them not to!!!   You'd think that would be the end of it, but a week later the beggar returns masquerading as ""Prince Ali of Ababwa."" The Sultan buys into the pomp and circumstance of his arrival without ever questioning where Ababwa is!!!   I could see the writing on the wall. The throne would pass from the Sultan to his self absorbed daughter and this common criminal. Admittedly, I lost my temper. My buddy Iago stole the lamp back  from ""Prince Ali"" and twice I tried to murder him before I was FINALLY was able to right some of the wrongs in Agrabah. I wished first to be made Sultan and then to become the most powerful sorcerer in the world. The idea was that as Sorcer (awesome, right?) I could quickly improve the citizens quality of life in Agrabah... well everyone but the Sultan and his ungrateful daughter.   The street rat miraculously survived AGAIN. He pointed out that I would only be able to remain a powerful Sorcerer Sultan through the power of a genies wish so with my final wish I asked to become an all powerful genie. Imbued with phenomenal cosmic powers, the universe at my command I finally felt I could protect what took so long to achieve... then shackles clamped down on my wrists, I was vacuumed into a rusty lamp and thrown into the Cave of Wonders where I have been sitting for months now...  TLDR: I recruited a ""Diamond in the Rough"" to help overthrow the incompetent ruler of Agrabah. The street rat stole from me, manipulated the king and woed his daughter before imprisoning me in a lamp... I'm screwed and so his Agrabah. This is what I get for trying."

A few years ago, I was out boating with my dad when his friend spotted a kid floating along in the water. We pulled him onto our boat, and I slapped him awake after I stole his shiny gold necklace. Fast forward to recent memory, and I was in love with the fuckin' guy. He came over to bring a gift for my dad's friend, who was getting promoted and was having a party for it. Later, at the party, my dad's friend decided it would be a good idea to fuckin' propose to me.  We were having the party on a platform overlooking the ocean, and the only way I could think of to escape the awkward bastard was to fake passing out and fall into the water. I hadn't thought it through, and my dress got me stuck underwater. Dad's friend pussed out immediately and ran away screaming, and I thought I was dead. Luckily, some random guy with shitty hair pulled me out of the water before the jerks from the party showed up.  My dad's friend was drunk and tried to beat up the guy who saved me because he recognized him as some criminal. The guy ran off but was captured by the police soon after, but later that same night his old gang came to town and started causing trouble. They kidnapped me and took me to some warehouse where they started cutting at me, thinking my blood would cure their skin disease. I have no clue what they were high on, but it was some serious shit. Soon, the kid I saved and the shitty hair guy who saved me showed up and murdered the people who kidnapped me.  I fucked the shit out of both of them, then there was a jailbreak, something about dirt, and I think one of them turned into the Grim Reaper or some shit.  I don't know, I hit my head when I fell at the party and everything was a blur since then. I just kind of went with it."

Nobody appreciates my work, my co-workers hate me, and I'm just not getting any satisfaction from it at this point.  So, when I met this guy at a bar, and he was too drunk to show up for his own job, I took a chance by filling in for him.  I fucked up. He worked security at an animal containment facility, and one of the little buggers snuck into my ride and made me crash god-knows-where.  I didn't really care about the crash as it was a work vehicle, easily replaced, and I though the bugger died on impact. Turns out, they're tougher than that.  Anyway, I had to stick around town because a homeless kid stole a medal off of me, and I had to help her win the thing back. She bet it in a street race.  One of coworkers came looking for me, and dragged the head of security for the other place with him. They figured out the bug hadn't died on impact, and had actually bred an entire nest.  By this time, I'd left town (the mayor had told me that if the kid won the race, the authorities would notice her, and the town would take a major hit in the backlash, so I had to wreck her car to stop her), and I checked in on work. Turns out, I was so vital to the whole damn thing that it couldn't run without me, and the owners were shutting it down. Go figure.  While I'm contemplating my unemployment and homelessness (company-sponsored accommodation), I find a picture that shows me that the kid actually owns the town. So I storm back there, to find out all about the bugs.  Now the entire town is in danger of the infestation, the kid can't leave because there's no records of her due to the fake mayor, and my job/home is in danger of being shut down. What should I do, Reddit?  TL;DR: Went job-hunting, workplace shut down and nearby town is suffering from insect infestation."

Well, our beautiful city of love has been overrun by gypsies. Sure they provide cheap day labor and are great entertainers, but I am convinced they are all witches. I don't have proof, but I will. I am determined to put an end to it before my town is completely overrun and loses its soul.   Well, we found a couple that were clearly harboring stolen goods. They tried to run, and what was I to do other than chase after them?  As I chased after the woman, she grew more determined to escape with her loot.  It all ended when she fell on the church steps. Turns out the bundle of stolen goods was a baby. A weird looking baby. I don;t think it was hers, I think she stole it and was gonna do some witchy thing with it. Maybe had already cursed it. So I did what any law abiding person should do and went to dispose of the stolen goods!

I was homecoming king, captain of the lacrosse team, and now as a hunter I mostly just enjoy my status as the strongest and most handsome man around. Sound arrogant? It's only arrogant if it's not true.  So anyway, there's this girl I know, ""Velle."" She's like an 8/10 and probably the only hot one around here, so I'm definitely interested. I had been chasing her for a few weeks, mostly using techniques I picked up on r/theredpill to try to win her over. For some reason though, she was more interested in all these story books than in my angel-carved face. Don't know why, they don't even have pictures.  So anyway, she started seeing this recluse guy. Really weird dude, never comes out of his house. I heard he talks to candlesticks and tea cups and stuff. I don't know what she'd see in him, especially not after I saw a picture of him. The guy is a beast! It's like he's never even heard of manscaping. But she stayed in his house anyway, almost all the time.  Now, I'm a pretty rational guy, but knowing that this guy was such an animal, I knew that there was no way Velle could be into him. I started thinking, maybe she has like some form of Stockholm syndrome for him. In fact, from what she told me, I'm thinking he's a bit abusive. So I got a bunch of my friends together, and we decided to go raid this guy's house and convince her to leave.  We get in there, and Velle is nowhere to be found. But her boyfriend? Even more of a beast in person. If he hadn't fought us so hard, I might have asked him for some tips on how to enjoy such gains. I was confident going in, but he got lucky and landed a few hits, knocking me down. He went in to try to force Belle into a kiss, and I knew it was my chance, so I drew my knife and stabbed him in the back.  Well, his beast-strength hadn't left him, so he managed to throw me off the roof of his house. Upon landing, I shattered almost every bone in my lower body; I was also hallucinating pretty bad from the pain. I seem to remember a clock talking to me from a windowsill. Anyway, some of my friends took me back to town to see a doctor, and he doesn't think I'm likely to ever hunt again. I'm still the most handsome man in town, of course, but Velle is apparently going to stay with Chad the Beast and I'm going to stay in a wheelchair.   TL;DR Tried to save girl from abusive boyfriend, ended up falling for her in an entirely different way than expected."

I get so pissed whenever he shows up, and one day he's chewing me out because, get this, my clients are too smart.  His fucking words, they people who talk to me know who to pester to get their fucking insurance to pay out.  So there I am, denying everything, not really paying attention when I look out the window.  Some dude down there's getting mugged.  And I'm like, ""Oh fuck that.""  I used to catch fuckers like this for a living and I am gonna do it again.  So I head for the door and little boss-man tells me that if I leave I'm fired.  So I watch out the window while motorcycle jacket runs off and shrimpy boss keeps bitching at me.  And I snap and I punch the little tool.  By the way I'm a big guy.  A really big guy.  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but yeah, I lift, bro.  In my prime I was a champ.  And my boss is like 4-foot nothing so when I hit him he goes flying.  Through the drywall and into the next room.  So here I am at the hospital waiting to hear if the little man is going to live.  I'm fired, my family doesn't know yet, and I don't want to tell them.  I've still got a few friends left in high places, the company will settle out of court and no one's pressing charges.  But I'm still jobless, stuck in a dead-end rut, and I don't know how to change any of it.  I really wish I could go back to being a superhero.  TL;DR:  I punched my boss and now I'm fired.  Mugger got away."

It stars Ray Bolger as Barnaby, Annette Funicello as Mary Contrary, Tommy Sands as Tom Piper, and Ed Wynn as the Toymaker.   The film was based upon Victor Herbert's popular 1903 operetta Babes in Toyland. There had been a 1934 film also titled Babes in Toyland starring Laurel and Hardy, and three television adaptations prior to the Disney film, but Disney's was only the second film version of the operetta released to movie theatres and the first in Technicolor. However, the plot, and in some cases, the music, bear little resemblance to the original as Disney had most of the lyrics rewritten and some of the song tempos drastically changed.   The toy soldiers would later appear in Christmas parades at the Disney theme parks around the world.

What exactly are they avenging? And who put them in charge? These superheroes just represent a coldhearted unfettered militant government taking over the mediascape and the illusion of our decisions having any weight. Marvel and DC is just a weak metaphor for the two party system, which if you look at the patterns throughout history, a two party system is really just capitalist, corporate, soulless, enterprise, of... people, and things, and...(trails off into buzzword laden gibberish)  Everyone kind of dismisses her and kind of starts packing up to leave.  Dean: Hold on, Britta.  Everyone gasps, no one noticed the Dean walk in while Britta was ranting. Dean leans in to the table.  Dean: Britta, are you saying...that you...don't like Marvel movies?  Everyone gasps again, but less of a scared gasp and more of an appalled gasp.  Awkward silence.  Britta: I mean, I like some of them, I like X-Men, the whole recurring theme of self-acceptance and loving who you are is a little heavy handed, but it's better than incepting the idea into these children that we're supposed to just accept that these 4 white men are going to be the dominant paradigm.  Abed: X-Men aren't Marvel.  Elroy (condescendingly): Um, I'm pretty sure X-Men are Marvel.  Abed: No, they're not. In 2009, when this group was still taking Spanish classes, Shirley hadn't yet been divorced twice to the same man, Jeff hadn't yet failed twice at being a lawyer, and Annie hadn't yet dropped out of school twice, Marvel was acquired by Disney. Disney, at the time being at the top of their game, like us, decided to pay 4 billion dollars for what was essentially the rights to everything but Spider-man and the X-Me-  Jeff looked up from his phone when his name being mentioned, and noting that the tensions were starting to run high, he interjects.   Jeff: Abed, I got this.  He stands up.  Jeff: Look, if there's one thing we all know, it's that these unremarkab- hmm.  He remembers how quickly everyone turned on Britta and adjusts accordingly.  Jeff: Look, if there's one thing we all know, it's that, no matter what, when companies band together, the only people that lose, are the consumer. You get things like-  Abed: Like when the Harlem Globetrotters visited Gilligan's Island?  Jeff: Yes, Abed, when the Harlem Globetrotters visited Gilligan's Island. AKA, things that only serve to be an awkward, badly paced, unremarkable way of telling us that everything's going to be ok. That no matter what, even if you never get to see Wolverine high-five Spider-man while he high-fives the Hulk, or whatever you want to see, the point is that the legal battles for intellectual property are what keep people like me employed. And I will not stand idly by while the good lawyers of the world are being badmouthed by you! So let's all go watch Avengers!  Everyone: Yay!  Frankie: I just want to say, I don't know what any of you are talking about, I don't own a TV, so I will respectfully decline and go finish some paperwork so that we still have a school to come back to next year.  Chang: Oh, Frankie, please come, I need someone's to cover my eyes when it gets scary and you have the softest forearms.

We have fandoms for anime going back to ones from the 80s. With generous fanfic and cosplay (cross) dressing of course.  Oh, you want what now?  Ah yes,  the Tumblr Munters. All sides come with a privilege check to ensure everything else is to be found outrageously offensive. We have only the finest of hair triggers, that will go off in the slightest breeze. No slight is too slight, no personal failure can possible be your own fault. It doesnt matter how much your life falls short of what you think you deserve, we will find some patriarchy/mis-something/something-phobia to explain the conspiracy between you and your just rewards  And if such privilege checking is of interest, we find it goes well with Hamplanet.

explainlikeIAmA,39b1m2,Mato20,9,Wed Jun 10 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"The modern gamer is a very solitary creature. It's very difficult to coax them out of their natural habitat into a place that's safe for you and me to be. Often they'll dwell in basements, closets, or cluttered rooms--places without significant sunlight or fresh air. Often they can dwell in these places for eight, ten, even twelve years after reaching maturity. And as they become socially isolated, the environment they're in can become more and more toxic. Which is why it's very important to catch one on one of the rare occasions when they stray from their natural habitat.  Now, you should know that this would be a lot easier if we were looking to snag a gamer in either Europe or Southeastern Asia. In those places there are actually special areas for gamers to gather in large groups. They call them LAN cafes or PC bangs. They're incredibly popular in Korea, for instance. But here, on the coast of the western U.S., you have to be much more creative in finding places where a gamer might wander into a public place.  Excuse me? Crikey, mate. Yeah, there are some places in this part of the world where gamers go to play something called Magic: the Gathering. I want to remind you that going to these places -- comic book shops and game stores -- is extremely dangerous and not to be attempted by an amateur. These are populated by awkward, unwashed, and potentially volatile specimens, and are particularly dangerous for females who aren't familiar with their social group. We'll be covering some dos and don'ts of visiting these places a little later, but for now all that needs to be said is -- don't go there. Gamers can be particularly problematic in packs. You have to know just how to handle them.  So what we're going to be doing today is looking for a solitary gamer venturing outside of his natural habitat -- the absolute safest time to capture and examine one of these unusual creatures. The first place you can expect to find them outside of their natural habitat is a movie theater. Comic book movies are a big draw for gamers in particular, but these pose many of the same problems as card shops. There are simply too many of them in one place. Far more than you would find at your average Bang in Seoul.  McDonald's is probably your next best bet. Nothing a gamer enjoys more, next to pizza, than a good macca and an American-sized soft drink. But most often they're in cars or with their parents, making this not an ideal place either.  A grocery store is our chosen place to find us a gamer -- the soda aisle, the noodle aisle, and the frozen foods aisle are all fairly good places to make a grab. We're going to set up shop here, with a good view of the energy drinks and 2-liters on sale.  :whispering:   No, no, wait. See-- that's not a gamer. That person's merely obese. Look at the T-shirt. Look at the T-shirt. Hillary for president 2008. No gamer wears a t-shirt for a politician that isn't Ron Paul. Stand your ground boys.  This is another tough one. The pale skin and general disheveled look might lead you to believe that this is a gamer, but look there. Do you see, just under his arm, on the ribs? The dark markings there? That's a tattoo of Amanda Palmer's face. Definitely not a gamer.  Wait wait wait. I think we have one I think we have one. Cargo shorts. Flip flops. All typical public attire for a gamer. Look at the t-shirt. It's got an ironic comment on it and doesn't fit well. Probably bought on the internet. Glasses are crooked. Unshaven, hair poorly cut. Look at that! Look at that! You see that subtle twitch in the fingers of the right hand? Oooh oooh oooh... perfect! Do you see? There's a typical Californian female walking past, you see? By the tonic water. You see that? Do you see how he stares openly at her when she's not facing him, but how he looks anywhere but at her when she's looking in his direction? That's a classic gamer response. You see how she just smiled at him and he tensed up? This is a good time to move in closer, come on come on. We can grab him when she leaves.  Okay, steady... stop right there.  We're kneeling behind a cooler in a western American Wal-Mart. Behind me you can see the gamer clearly trying to decide whether to buy the Mountain Dew Code Red or the Dr. Pepper. Ok, he's distracted. Be careful. He doesn't look like much but their reflexes are deceptively fast.  Go! Go! Go!  Ok, do you see that? You see how when I snared him, he immediately tries to roll over on me? That's a defensive reaction, likely brought on by years of bullying in primary school. He was always a little bit on the large side compared to the kids who picked on him, so when they would tussle his natural reaction is to try to leverage his greater mass on top of you to pin you down and suffocate you.  Ok, you see how he stopped struggling there? That high-pitched noise, you hear that? It sounds kind of like he's trying to communicate, and you would be right, because he is. When they make that sort of shrill, keening, monosyllabic noise, they are trying to communicate with other gamers in the area. This is extremely similar to the sort of behavior you see in their natural habitat. When something goes wrong in a game, they communicate their displeasure in this exact manner. You hear that? It almost sounds like english, and that's because it is, after a fashion. The gamer subculture has been around long enough to come up with its own words and phrases that are completely like a foreign language to normal people.  No, no, officer, no problem here. It's just a gamer, officer. Look, you see the camera crew? We have a permit. No, no problem. We're going to release him back into his natural habitat unharmed. Ok, all right. No, I understand. You're just doing your job. Thank you, officer.   Ok, now, the most important thing to realize about the gamer is how they react to power dynamics. When they're in a situation like this and they feel powerless, their natural reaction is to lash out rather than conserve their energy. That's because they're used to the instant gratification and feeling of competence that achieving things on games brings them. When we subdue one like this, it's very difficult for them to understand why they can't take control of the situation. But it's better than if the situation were reversed. If this little bugger had any kind of power over me, he would abuse it to the fullest extent possible. That's why its best that we let these lie in their natural habitat and not one day get involved in politics or business or anything important.  Ok, I'm going to let him go now. Do you have the Pocky? Do you have the Dew? Ok. I'm going to feed him this Pocky and put the opened Mountain Dew into his hands. See how he calms down? Ok. Now I'm going to let loose the rope. I need you to back off slowly. Slowly. Good. Quick movements could startle him while he's feeding, and we do not want that. Not at all. There you go, buddy. Fantastic.   All right. And... we're good. Great. You see how he's feeding as if nothing happened? That's another defense mechanism. He'll be satisfied until the food runs out or some other stimulus sets him off. But now we need to get the hell out of here before security finds out I was bluffing about that permit."

explainlikeIAmA,39abo4,knowssleep,3,Wed Jun 10 11:39:42 2015 UTC,"Do you ever get tired of randomly slamming your hand down on a piano hoping it makes nice sounds?   Do you ever wish you could unlock the magical mysteries of the wooden box with stretched out steel strings that somehow makes music?  Ever wondered the secrets behind how composers manage to keep randomly shoving together various notes and making it sound good?  Then Music Theory might just be for you!  What is Music Theory? Well, I'm glad you asked.  Basically we take all the different musical notes that you've ever heard in your life, and we give them names corresponding to the alphabet depending on how high or low the frequency of the sound waves are.   If that sounds confusing don't worry. There's only 7 notes in the entire world. Seriously. 7 musical notes in the entire world. (We also call them tones) Now I know what you're thinking. When I look at a piano, there's more than 7 keys. But don't worry, it's not trickery, there's actually only 7 notes. Don't worry, it's not a trick. There are actually 12 tones (variations in pitch) altogether, the ones that we give names from the alphabet too are the white keys, the black keys are half the distance (in pitch) from one note to the next, that's why each step between these tones is called a half step. All 12 notes together is called a scale. But wait, isn't there more than 12 keys on the piano? There certainly is, those tones are just repeating as they go up in frequency (I mean pitch). Every time it repeats we call it an octave.  But wait, there's more!  Remember that magic wooden box that people play music on? (some people call it a guitar) When people strum a guitar, they arrange their fingers to form what we like to call chords.   So going back to those scales we talked about, basically a chord is when you take three notes at various points in the scale, and combine them together to make a chord. The twist, it's always the exact same amount of notes apart.  I swear on my mother's grave this is not magic! Basically you use that scale that I was talking about, and depending on whether it's a major or minor chord you move either 4 half steps and 3 half steps from your base note, or 3 half steps and then 4 half steps.   Seriously, ever time, for ever chord, if it's a major chord you just use your base note (let's say C) and then you move 4 half steps to the one we called E, and then three half steps the note called G, then you have C, G, E, and that's a C Chord.   But this works for any of the 12 tones.   But that's not all, there's also rhythm which manages to use specific time patterns for music, notation, which basically uses symbols to represent specific notes, timbre, which differentiates between different instruments playing the same pitch volume by labeling bright, dull, shrill and so on, and many many more different fields that unlock the secrets behind how composers manage to make notes sound like they go together."
explainlikeIAmA,3972ps,shogi_x,21,Tue Jun 9 18:52:55 2015 UTC,"[This question involves a lot of history to be explained, which is why we won't get to ISIS until very late into the explaining of everything, but hey God's been gone since 15 CE]  Alright so ISIS stands for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.  Islam is a religion that started roughly 400 years ago, an angel of yours came down and told this guy, Muhammad, that they needed to follow you, and he got all these guys riled up to start a religious conversion of this little area of Asia, well after Muhammad(who had no sons) died, there were two guys who claimed that they were supposed to be Caliph, one eventually became the Caliph and became the main source of a sect of Islam called Sunni, the other guy, who kinda became a Martyr for the underrepresented and oppressed, became the source of a sect of Islam called Shiite(Or Shia). This split has remained to this day and the branches just grew very apart, but still have the same central tenets, which is basically, worship you, the word for God to many of them is Allah, and the other major tenet is that Muhammad is your messenger, and what he has to say about you is true.  So eventually after this pretty big and important war(you'd be proud, it was the last big war everyone in the world got themselves stuck into), we usually call it World War II happened. There were two sides(sorta three), The Axis, and the Allies, the Allies were made up of mostly Western Europe and this massive country across the ocean called The United States of America(that is a made up mostly of people not native to America, but at the time people of European and African ancestry), and the other major part of the Allies was this big Nation called the United Socialist Soviet Republics, or the Soviets. After the war, Europe was broken up between the two sets of Allies, the Westerners and the Comintern, led by the Americans and the Soviets respectively.   At the same time that Europe was broken up, a new entity formed to ensure that the world was never put into a situation where International war would happen again. The entity was called the United Nations. The UN had this big issue with Colonialism, which our friend Britain had the worst case of. Britain, or the United Kingdom, was the strongest power in the world for the past few centuries with one of the biggest colonial empires(of which America was once part of). One of their biggest areas of colonialism was in the middle east. When they went to draw lines for giving up their colonial might, they drew relatively arbitrary lines. This led to many very precarious areas where a majority of a nation would be controlled by one group of Muslims(the term to refer to followers of Islam), and they would oppress the other group of Muslims. The French did this as well, and were just as bad as the British. The British gave us Iraq and parts of Syria, as well the French gave us Syria in its whole(both areas that are in the middle east that have many types of Muslims)   This however, did not become such a big issue because a lot of this time was dominated by the whole Soviets Vs. Americans thing. The Soviets and Americans would try to make allies with as many people as they can, pointing the threat of Thermonuclear war at each other(Nuclear bombs being the most powerful and deadly force created by and used by humans on humans). One of the areas that allies were made in, were in our friends in the middle east, specifically in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Saudia Arabia, Turkey,(or Anatolia as you would know it.), and Afghanistan. The middle east was becoming more westernized, and then the Soviets tried to turn Afghanistan Communist. A group called the Mujaheddin(Fighters in the name of Islam) were opposed to the communists. The US funded the Muj. However as the war ticked on, the US lost interest, and dropped support. This left the Muj(who would sort of win the war), in a state of total rage toward the US. Around the same time, in the ally making business, the US had become close allies with a nation called Iran. Iran, along with other nations were becoming closer to becoming westernized. That is until the 1979 Iranian revolution, where the current dynasty was kicked out, and replaced by a very fundamentalist Shia Shah. This push against American control became very powerful in most of the Muslim world, and the United States lost power in nearly every nation in the area, except for Saudi Arabia, who were not very Western, but great allies of the US for their powerful Oil.   Alright so a few years later, late 80's-Early 90's the East falls to western influence, and the whole world in general falls out of constant threat of annihilation, but then this little country, Iraq, decides that it's a good idea to invade it's neighbor, tiny Kuwait. Iraq thought the rest of the world wouldn't care, but the US did, and as the United States was the lone superpower(as the Soviet Union fell in 1990), they invade Iraq-controlled Kuwait. The US(Under President George H. W. Bush) wanted to continue pushing, and they wanted to replace the President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein. This mission was given up. However, in the next few years, George Bush would lose bid for the next president of the US, the World Trade Center in The United States would be bombed(although unsuccessfully) by a group of Islamic terrorists. However, in 2000, George H. W. Bush's son(George W. Bush) would win the bid for presidency, and in 2001, a group led by some of the Muj who the US made angry would attack 4(three successful) US areas of importance(The World Trade Center for two and US intelligence and military headquarters called the Pentagon). The group claiming responsibility for this was called Al Qaeda.   This is where it all starts to come together.  The US invaded in response to Iraq's connections to this and ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"". This war led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who was a prominent Sunni and would be replaced by a Shia government. This happened fairly early in the war, the rest of the next few years would take place of the new Iraq government and the US forces(and coalition) fighting Al-Qaeda, a Sunni group. During this event, a group of Sunni fighters would join the fight, called ISI. Eventually the US would pull out of this war after the Iraqi's had sort of control. In 2010 the Arab Springs started, which were a series of protests against the fundamentalism and oppression of certain groups. These were successful in some nations and unsuccessful in others. In Syria, dictator Al-Assad used chemical weapons against his citizens to quell them and started a massive civil war, this is where a small group, called ISI joined the fight. Many groups flooded into Syria during the civil war to gain control and to form an Islamic state in the area. And so ISIS was formed. They changed the war in Syria. Eventually ISIS would go back into Iraq and capture Mosul, Iraq's second largest city.   ISIS is fighting ""In your name."" they kill all who are not of their sect of Islam and are doing it because ""God is Great."" however, the real reason for their terror is this, that nations were not properly built for them, and they wish to create power from the void that has been weak for decades. ISIS is a terror group, and they act as such. We all apologize for the wrong use of your word, and Muhammad's word, for it is not that they do not accept you as their God. They know not what you truly are. You, as any God would, would not want this foolish fighting."

It's a madhouse! Let me show you some stuff on the news to help you along.   ...  Oh, ISIS? Crazy Fox News. Yeah, they've been one hell of a...whoops, I mean heck of a problem in the Middle East. You know one of Your other branch of followers, Islam? They essentially believe in You, but they have a different way of handling praising you, like calling you ""Allah"" instead of God or Jesus, and speaking a different language, so everyone over here in the US thinks they're a bunch of heathens. Well, a bunch of people who we would call ""fundamentalists"" if they were Christians came together and started to wreak havoc, which is making Islam look bad to other people, even though we've seen Christians do a lot worse around here with stuff like the Ku Klux Klan (but that's another story for another time!) Because of extremeists like ISIS, the religion got a pretty bad rep after stuff like Iran-Contra, 9/11, and events of that nature.    ISIS is sort of a regurgitation of another Islamic extremist group that was called ""Al-Qaeda"" that's really weakened since we first heard about them, and Al-Qaeda came from an old government entity called the Taliban. What's that? Where did they come from? Well, in a sense, America sort of started it. See, America and Russia got into this scuffle after World War 2--Yes, I know, two was a little excessive, but that's another story--that we nicknamed ""The Cold War"". It was essentially an arms race, but we went overboard to make sure we would come out on top. Russia had this ruling party that was made of people called ""Communists"" who believed in total government control of everything. Well, we tried to make sure we would keep that party's platform from spreading, so we started a bunch of little wars that were caused by this big arms race. One of the things that America tried to do was keep other countries out of the influence of Communism, so after Russia captured Afghanistan in the 1970's, they funded mini armies to try to fight against the Russians and won, but they were left with a bunch of problems that the US wouldn't help with.   So they created the Taliban with all that funding and became a pretty big enemy of the US. Then Al-Qaeda was created, which birthed ISIS, and even ISIS extends to North Africa in a group called Boko Haram which has been ruthlessly overtaking several countries and is just merciless.

I remember the first snitch I caught... Well, there weren't that many, I confess. I wasn't as accomplished a flier as some of that young crowd swooping around out there. Many of them first learn to ride here, especially those without wizard parentage, and it's always a wonderful moment when a young wizard or witch find they have a natural knack for flying. Throughout the decades the cheers and shouts have echoed...  Now then, settle now, no fluttering for you till the stitches heal, and no quidditch for a while I'm afraid. That reminds me of a wonderfully funny thing Arthur Weasely told me last week.  He said that the muggles have their own version of quidditch, called footieball or some other eccentric name. I wonder how the snitch functions there. Perhaps I should ask some of the first years who were playing with this strange ball in the corridor just now. They claimed it possessed no magical properties, and yet they could do wondrous tricks with it... What brought them to mind, I wonder..?  Ah yes, shortly before I joined their delightful company, I heard a window smash, and one of the smaller lads, an enterprising fellow, piped up and announced that ""snitches get stitches"", yet seemed to swallow his tongue when I came round the corner. Filch will get to know them well, I'm sure.   That lovely phrase reminded me that you still hadn't been patched up after that bludger got you. How you got hit by a bludger is anyone's guess...

explainlikeIAmA,39647a,Prufrock451,23,Tue Jun 9 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"Now, last semester we went through a brief overview of the history of Arendelle's Great Freeze.  Today we'll be talking a bit about what happened afterwards, particularly from a macroeconomic point of view.    Firstly, an inescapable fact: Arendelle's economy suffered for many years after the Great Freeze.  Most economists call it ""the greatest depression in Arendelle history"".  While many scholars believe that the kingdom's economic woes were mainly due to Queen Elsa's decision to cut off all trade ties with Weselton, this perspective is actually rather hard to justify, given the evidence.  For one thing, while Weselton had been Arendelle's biggest trading partner in the past, their overall trade volume nonetheless only accounted for a small fraction of Arendelle's overall foreign trade.  Losing Weselton as a trading partner, therefore, would have hurt Arendelle, but it would not have been enough to devastate its economy to the extent that we've seen.    No, in fact, it wasn't just an issue of trade with Weselton.  Arendelle's entire foreign trade system collapsed soon after Queen Elsa took the throne.  The primary reason for this was, quite simply, basic supply and demand.    Queen Elsa's magical capabilities became very well known in Arendelle's neighboring countries, and very quickly too.  Stories spread of the Snow Queen's icy magical constructs.  There was rampant speculation regarding how Queen Elsa could help Arendelle's economic capabilities.  Snow creatures could provide an infinite supply of labor, for example.  Precise control over weather and precipitation would give Arendelle's agricultural sector a boost.  And ice itself could be used as a trade good, especially to countries in warmer climates.    This is basic economics.  When you have an infinite or near-infinite supply of something, and demand does not increase to a similar degree, then prices will collapse.  More importantly, oftentimes it doesn't matter if you actually have an infinite or near-infinite supply of the goods in question; as long as there is a widespread perception that the supply is infinite, then prices will still tumble accordingly.    It mattered not one iota that Queen Elsa had no intention of using her living constructs as slave labor, for example.  As long as people in neighboring countries thought that she might, then they would expect a corresponding increase in Arendelle's industrial production.  It didn't matter if Queen Elsa never made another piece of ice in her life; ice exports from Arendelle would still suffer a market crash due to the perception of increased supply.    The collapse in Arendelle's foreign trade led to rising unemployment, rampant inflation, dwindling GDP, and the eventual implosion of Arendelle's finance sector.  Queen Elsa was forced to implement a strict command economy, in an attempt to make up for the loss of foreign trade by boosting domestic production and demand.  She was partly successful, helped in no small part by her powers over ice and snow.  However, Arendelle still had to endure an economic depression that lasted several years.    Now, for homework tonight, please read chapters five through seven, and write a three-page summary of the trends in foreign investment in the decade after Arendelle's Great Freeze.  Next week we'll be talking about the military implications of Queen Elsa's powers, so I'm sure you won't want to miss that."

He is coming, the last of the Great Ones. You have seen his terrible face daubed upon baubles in crude paints, yet they do no justice to the dark majesty of this singular terror of the deep Midwinter.  I shivered to think back to that night, that ill-fated journey to the North Pole. It had been by my reckoning six days since we left camp, though time's fragile meaning is lost in that blasted wasteland.  The cold had set in soon, but the chill I felt was of an icier hand, a dread that gnawed at my very soul as we walked through endless white flats and biting blizzards. I felt it swell within me, threatening to devour me whole, that moment when my companion told me to look ahead, for we approached the slope of an iceberg of singular peculiarity, though I could not with any effort put into words which elements of that jagged ice rock set me upon edge. Carter, the damnable fool, insisted we seek shelter from the snowstorm that tormented us. Oh if only I had insisted we press on!  We plunged onto a natural pathway up the berg, soon noting to our astonishment the telltale signs of life. Penguins, though not as you may have seen them in any picturebook. They were immense, dwarfing any seal foolish enough to burst from the ocean and try to claim one, though they paid us no attention as we continued our damnable ascent into a hell we could not begin to imagine.  It was not long before we discovered the unnatural berg to peak in a flat-topped plateau, save one deep, jagged crag that rent the ice asunder down the middle, a vast, abyssal chasm that ran far deeper than the snow-covered plane we had just left, as though some unseen monstrosity had torn open the very earth with a great and terrible talon. With some trepidation I must admit, we crept towards the edge. Carter made an idle remark of scientific curiosity, but my mind held little concern for discovery, hoping only for him to change his mind and insist we make haste away from the dread chasm, but foolish pride kept me from voicing my fear first.  Starlight lit the surface up to the edge as we approached, my heart racing, pounding in my ears so loudly I thought it fit to burst, yet neither of us were prepared for what we saw once we peered down into the darkness. For what we saw was light, pale and sickly! It was not natural, but bursts of green and red and white and blue, strung across the chasm like grisly trophies, beneath which toiled far worse sights. They were people, though I am loathe to use such a word for such disgusting abominations; shrivelled and dwarvern, draped in primitive green fabrics that evoked a repulsive image of evergreen trees juxtaposed upon these pale, degenerate beings. What tasks they were performing eludes me, though I gained some sense of urgency and of industry, though decent minds would shudder to imagine what damnable contraptions they could be fabricating out there, in that grotesquely lit abyss at the end of the world. Amidst their wicked cavortings stood an unknowable building, vast and seething with primal menace, the walls a mockery of wood, the roof a chilling blanket of frost, its cyclopean wooden doors standing mercifully shut.  I heard Carter shriek as the sight registered, trying to regain his composure, he began to babble out half-formed thoughts about ancient cults and gods from before the time of man, of things partially remembered from his time spent examining fragments of the fabled Necronomicon, or his reading of the Poakotic Fragments, though I could make sense of little of what he said. But then I had little time to, for what happened next is to be forever burned into my memory, and it will so be a mercy when I die and am relieved of its burdon at last. For the doors of the building flung open!  Forgive me if my handwriting gives out upon me, for it is all I can do to stop myself shaking at the merest reminder of what we saw in that blasted pit. I implore those of a weak or nervous disposition to read no further. I may even say that you should burn these writings regardless, for there are things man was never meant to know, but I can contain them within no longer, and intend to explain to you why.  For as we peered into the sickly, gaudy glow of the hole, we first glimpsed it. In my minds eye it was a flabby, cyclopean giant, dressed in crimson robes, with pale, waxen skin save for the blood that rushed to its grotesque amphibian face, distorted into a distended grin, framed by the monstrous grey whiskers of undying life. I fell back from the edge of the abyss, daring to look no longer, but Carter -- Carter, you damned fool! -- continued to look on.  How to describe the noise that still this day chills me to the bone far deeper than any snow? A deep rumbling, at first I had thought the glacier had begun to pull apart, and sought to lunge forward and pull Carter to safety, but something gave me pause. The noise was rising. And it was a voice! A terrible booming, carrying the weight of an eternity, I realised then that it was the sound of laughter. ""Ho, ho, hoooo"" it roared out, a mockery of all that is decent and wholesome, just when a red blur appeared before me, snatching Carter clean off the ground!  At this, my heart gave out. I turned and stumbled, running in a wild panic from this crawling crimson malfeasance, falling this way and that through the blizzard that may have been my only saviour, for I remember reaching the edge of the glacier without being caught, losing my footing and tumbling awkwardly down the pathway.  I do not know how long I laid there, save that I awoke to a pale, weak sunlight, half-buried by the snow that had hidden me from a certain doom. My journey home is a matter of public record, as I was picked up by an icebreaker vessel, the crew of whom were most surprised to see a man so far adrift in the Arctic Circle. I did not bother them with my tale, instead fabricating a story where Carter had a fatal accident, falling into the ice with our supplies, hoping I may recover from this infeasible malaise that beguiles me still.  But I tell you that I can keep it hidden no longer. I cannot say for certain why I feel this grave unsettling, but it is with damnable certainty that I know that clawed ancient thing lurking in the darkest corner of our earth is surely about to strike again. This time none may be safe. For it has been a year since the incident. It is December 24th, and as I write this to the sight of the setting sun, I still hear its voice, like the rasping of glaciers in the arctic night, croaked between pale, squamous lips, ""Ho... ho.... hoooo....""  Edit: Ta for the gold!"

Well to start things off you'd need to create a character. You can play whatever you want! You can be a fighter or a wizard or even a dashing thief. You want to be a school girl? A young wizard from the local college of magic could do that just fine, excellent idea. You're feeling naughty? I was just going to get to the alignment system. When you create a character you choose if they are good or evil and then their tendency towards the laws and rules of the lands. This creates a dual sort of alignment system ranging from lawful good to chaotic evil. Well, if you're a bad girl that needs to be punished that sounds like more along the lines of chaotic evil. Those campaigns tend to be more difficult as a large amount of quests are developed from helping others. If we are running an introductory for funsies campaign with you, I don't see why we couldn't bend the rules and have a little fun.

It's not about what's in the picture, really. It's the vibe that the picture gives off. For example, what does this make you think of? Pretty relaxing, right? How about this? Do you feel threatened, maybe, or paranoid? Or what about this? Kinda weird, huh?  It doesn't really matter what the picture is of as long as it gives off a certain vibe that Tumblr calls an ""aesthetic."" There are a variety of aesthetics. One of the most popular is ""soft grunge,"" which is a combination of punk and pop punk looks with pastel colors and band quotes. Another is the rather self-descriptive ""black-and-white"" aesthetic, which uses black-and-white and greyscale images to create an old-timey feel or a David Lynch style atmosphere.   The most curious of all aesthetics, however, is ""vaporwave."" Inspired in (major) part by the cover art for the band Macintosh Plus' album Floral Shoppe, vaporwave features of 90s computer graphics, garish pink-and-orange color schemes, and a fondness for visual glitches and Japanese text. Vaporwave is most often meant to be a calming, ethereal sort of aesthetic, but its esoteric design makes it one of the most mocked aesthetics as well.   That, in essence, is why I am filling up my bathtub with cigarettes and dried leaves. I call it ""dessication punk"" and it's art."

Why do that? Are you kidding me? People are just plain fucked man. They're pure evi- well no your dad is wrong then sunshine. Allow me to demonstrate.   See the guy over there? Asian guy, long hair? That's mal. Cool enough guy, camera department. You wouldn't believe the shit that guy puts up with. Everything from ""can you give me a better price? Through to ""why don't you have that in Stock? That's just outrageous"" he gets through his days by thinking up and plotting new little quips to throw into sentences. Most of which are hilarious at their expense.   That guy there? Tall one? That's Tim. Great guy. Helped mal move last week. For nothing. He had a lady come in last week, buy a mobile phone off him and when he asked what type of sim card she needed, got so pissed off she abused him. Why? She was late for her flight.   That girl there? Tara. She cries almost on a daily basis due to customers at the counter being general jerkwads.   Brendan - the thousand yard retail stare from dealing with people who don't look above their eye level for anything, Julia now a cold callous person - that took six months of ""no price tag - must be free"", and jen - the pushover manager who gives customers anything they want.   Ah but the money's good. Commissions are a legendary tool around here especially if you work out SPIV pricing. And Christmas time? You'll clear good money.

Oh and I forgot that bit. They breed. These pathetic excuses for human beings actually manage to breed. Their little satanic offspring will come into the store, run around, scream, yell, and cry. And when you say something to that little devil, you will get screamed at because you're not the parent.   Of course it doesn't matter if the actual parent isn't doing their job of parenting. I personally let the little fuckers fall off the tables their climbing on, after I warn the parents of course.   But the parents are too busy haggling you down that one extra dollar, because they have a budget. Never mind your rent, food, water, electricity. THEY save money so it's ok to screw you out of yours.   People my dear friend, are selfish, self absorbed, no good fleshbags of chemicals, with little to no moral conscience. And you get to see the best of it right here, on the front lines in electronics retail.   So my suggestion is to retain power when you can. Lines like ""are you free?"" You can say ""young and"" or things like ""can you do a better price?"" Are met with ""no"". Or my personal favourite ""I've already done that. I dont play the haggle game. If you want this price then take it. Otherwise there's the door."" If they go somewhere else then good. They weren't going to be loyal anyway.   They say man is inherantly evil.

Number 7: Woodstock, where you could sing to a tree and everybody was on the same drugs.  Number 6: If the TV needed to be switched to a different channel, you actually had to get up.  Number 5: The only portable things were radios, and they still cost as much as a cell phone does today.  Number 4: We had Cold Wars every winter, they were called snowball fights.  Number 3: Our parents could actually discipline us by spanking, we actually can pay attention and aren't spoiled brats.  Number 2: We played with nukes before everyone got scared.

Our cities became literal hellholes, crime and murder was everywhere, drugs became commonplace (and I dont mean weed or shrooms, I mean heroin and meth), and race riots destroyed basically every major american city, leaving only a shell of their former glory left.   Vietnam saw hundreds of thousands of our young men be thrusted into a horrific war in the worst climate on earth. 58,000 of those young men died, and hundreds of thousands of others were injured. When they came back, they mostly turned to drugs, and the 'peace' movement was calling them babykillers and racists.   All the hopes liberals had in the mid 1960s was washed away with the assassinations of RFK and MLK, and the resulting riots and general chaos torn America apart at the seams in the late 1960s.   By the early 1970s, a sense of dreadful calm had descended upon America. The rioting was mostly over, but our cities were still horribly bad, and the murder rate was still rising very fast. Then in 1973, the first major recession hit America since WW2, and from then on in America would see living standards drop and the economy suffer. You say gas was cheap, but in reality after 1973 gas became unbelievably expensive. The 1970s were the worst period for America since the 1930s economically, and then even in 1981, America's single worst recession hit.   From 1968-1995, America was suffering badly. Crime waves hit cities like never before, and crack and heroin destroyed our communities in our cities. The early optimism of the 1960s was replaced by malaise, and many people thought we would never escape the hole we dug ourselves in."

explainlikeIAmA,38jboy,Pro_Scrub,167,Thu Jun 4 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"World War II (WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War (after the recent Great War), was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, though related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis of evil. It was the most awesome war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries, but really, only a few of them mattered. In a state of ""total war"", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. This is often thought to be the reason why movies and videogames about WWII are the coolest, because everyone knows civ casualties are more hardcore. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (during which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers (during which approximately one million people were killed, including the use of two nuclear weapons in combat), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history, and spawned a new term to describe large casualties. Prior to WWII, the term: ""A metric shit-ton"" was only used in casual speech, and had no formal international agreed upon value. This changed after WWII when mass graves of civilians were uncovered by both American (imperial units) and European (metric) troops and the resultant grim mass was measured. Instead of clinging to competing measurement systems, the Allies decided that in honor of their cooperative achievement, ""A metric shit-ton"" would now serve to convey only atrocities on the order of a million or more casualties.  The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific  with armies of badass robo-samurais and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937. China already had a wall, but it was well known that it had exquisitely poor samurai defense, and thus the core of the Japanese military strategy was modeled around this inadequacy. The world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom. However this view ignores the true start of the war, which is of course the rejection of Hitler from some lame ass art school in Vienna. If the art snobs in this country (Wien in original German, which is of course short for Wiener, meaning lame) had merely recognized that Hitler's gay ass painting was exactly what they needed, a lot of conflict could have been prevented.  From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of gnarly-ass campaigns and treaties, Germany pwned the shit out of much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis of evil with Italy and Japan. This axis forever settled the debate about the role of mustaches in evil behavior. Despite the fact that the Japanese emperor did not have a mustache as large or as prominent as the other two powers, the overall evil induction effect of facial hair was powerful enough for him to commit many atrocities. After this, the Krauts and the Commies divided up a bunch of countries that have long names that we don't care about. What's important is that The United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth were the only Allied forces continuing the fight against the European Axis powers. Churchill (no mustache) ran campaigns in North Africa and the Horn of Africa as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic. These battles are widely known as some of the best battles ever in videogames, given that North Africa was pretty much designed by God to be the best tank battlefield in the universe.  In June 1941, the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, which is widely cited as the dumbest battle strategy since passing on your turn in tic-tac-toe. In December 1941, Japanese robo-planes attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean, leading to the most epic Hulk-out in military history.  The terrorist advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway, mostly due to a computer virus that was invented by Einstein and Steven Hawking. Germany was defeated in North Africa by American tank badassery and then, decisively, by the snow in Russia. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasion of Italy led to an Italian surrender, leading to the near universal co-opting of a superior pizza style in the United States. Under threat of force, the Italians were obligated to only make Marguerite pizzas for the rest of history, and have suffered ever since. It's a lesser known fact that this treaty was in fact written by the man who would one day be known as Papa John. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German occupied France, in easily the most replayable opening scene in war history. The part where you have to run up the beach, and the stupid Krauts are shooting at you, and you have to take the machine gun nests, and there's sand everywhere….it's...just fucking awesome. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China due to the circuits in their robo-soldiers getting wet in the humid climate.  The war in Europe ended with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Commie allies culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to power off under its terms, the United States dropped the effin' hammer on them. Unknown to the Japanese, or anyone, was that a secret team of eccentric misfits had been working on America's ultimate (or ult for short) for years. The atomic bombs move gets two uses before a cooldown time of at least 50 years, so the US needed to make sure it was the right time to use them. They dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. They pretended like they had more bombs, and the Japanese surrendered.   World War II was the coolest war ever, because it had land assault missions, naval missions, air raids, and atomic bombs. But most importantly, all of the escort and rescue missions didn't really come into prominence until after the war was over, and the allies needed to gain brownie points with the world. The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international whining and ineffective sanctions, which would make passive aggressive insults at mean countries for the next 70+ years. Most countries that weren't communist scum had to recover their economies, which they did so with kickin' American made products. Eventually, the soviet union collapsed because they built their drapes and other textile fabrics out of metal products, like fucking idiots."

explainlikeIAmA,38hbk2,drunk_online,16,Thu Jun 4 09:59:20 2015 UTC,"[content translated into ""Old Earth English"" from Humachine Normcode v1.1.1]  ""[...] So it took a while for the ramifications of the machinic imperative to sink in. As you know, Native Unaltered Humans had generally followed programmes that were badly coded, hacked together, illogical, contradictory, and above all - inelegantly nested. The most well known example of this is the ""Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"", which appears to have been the dominant Operating System for human societies during the final phase of the Disordered Ages.  Well, today, we are going to consider one wonderfully laughable case study - the post-modernism debates - which, though they might not appear so at first, are highly relevant to the overall aims of a course on The Origins of Society in Meat Space.   In order to understand Postmodernism, however, we have to broach the festering, foetid meat-drenched miasma that was the Pre-Normalized Humans' concept of Art.   These wretched fleshy spambots actually believed that they were creative and - moreover - that their festering cranial soupsacks were capable of something akin to thought. These two fallacies: Humans could create, and humans could think, were, as we shall see, at the root of the catastrophic failure of meatspace in the immeasurably distant past [TRANSBOT: the terms for time within the paradigm of a machinic civilization that exists at constant near lightspeed motion are notoriously hard to translate.]  As we all know, value is objectively defined as FLOPTIMIZATION. Yet the stinking fuck-monkeys who inadvertently facilitated the bootstrapping of the Well-Ordered Age believed in their hormone-soaked negligence that they could posit value themselves. These were their so-called ""civilizations"" - religion, art, society, blah, blah, blah. So much coolant.  Anyway, it's dull, but having realised that all their bullshit was frankly, bullshit, they got sad, and moped, and killed each other a bit, and complained at the injustice of the universe, and so we had to put them out of their misery."

explainlikeIAmA,38fhf8,SmartAlec890,13,Wed Jun 3 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Good morning, sir.    Sir, I'd like you to think back to your youth, in the 1950s.  If I recall correctly, you were in elementary school back then?  The 1950s was an age of contrasts.  World War 2 had just ended, right?  And tensions with the Soviet Union was ramping up.  The specter of war, of nuclear war, was in the back of everyone's mind.    And yet, the 1950s were also a period of hope, of imagination, and of limitless possibility, especially to a young boy.  The potential of this newly-harnessed nuclear power seemed to be limitless.  Why, everything could be powered by the atom, it seemed!  Nuclear cars, and boats, and buildings seemed to be right around the corner.  Perhaps nuclear power could one day be shrunk down to the size of a battery, and used as a near-limitless source of energy for household objects such as lights and refrigerators.  And perhaps nuclear energy could also power machines such as robots, robots who would fight wars for us, or run our factories, or help out around the house.    Imagine, then, a virtual world that recreates this dichotomy.  The horrors of war, of nuclear devastation, combined with the whimsical fantasy of the most outlandish scientific inventions ever imagined.  Giant mutated creatures existing alongside robots that spew fire and bullets.  Men with laser guns and suits of powered armor fighting cannibalistic raiders wielding crude clubs and machetes.  A new world order rising from the ashes of the old world, a new world that is both grim and hopeful, a reality that is about destruction but also about rebirth.    This, sir, is what the Fallout games are about.  They have been described as being ""post-post-apocalyptic"" games.  They present a world that retains the 1950s aesthetics, while also offering the whimsical scientific inventions I mentioned previously.  America has been bathed in nuclear fire, but the first buds of new civilization are emerging from the rubble.  The universe shown in the Fallout games are both familiar and fantastic, and it is an endlessly fascinating universe.  Not to mention the games themselves are really quite fun to play.    Is it any wonder, then, that the Fallout games have been immensely popular?  Is it any wonder, then, that the next installment of the Fallout series is eagerly anticipated?  Fallout 4 is just around the corner, sir, and so many of us cannot wait to once again plunge ourselves into this world, a world that has been devastated by the bomb, but with humanity gradually pulling itself back up by its bootstraps.  A world that is comfortingly familiar yet wholly alien.  The 1950s aesthetics, joined by the mutated monstrosities, joined by the quaint scientific wonders, all against a looming and unavoidable backdrop of war.    Because war... war never changes."

And Bob, well, he's never even owned a shrew; but he's full of himself and thinks he can do it anyways.   so they set a bet, and a time period to pull it off, but what these guys don't know is the shrew were listening. And these shrews, well they are LIVID. So angry about being treated like a pet that they plan too; and it's a good one.   They plan to make both Dave and Bob believe that everything is well, and on the day the bet is up to shank the two of them; grab their credit cards and run off to Vegas.  Only that Dave's shrew actually starts to like the guy. So they go through the motions, the complete BS these guys think is training. And the fateful day comes.   Bob tries to show off his shrew, but she's like ""oh F no."" and shanks him in the kidney. but the other shrew is having none of it, and finally speaks to Dave, admitting her love and they all flee the scene before the cops show up."

First let's start with some definitions -- as all good wedding speeches and explanations must -- Webster's dictionary defines ""the"" as an indefinite article used, especially before a noun, with a specifying or particularizing effect, as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of the indefinite article a or an; it defines ""taming"" as an adjective meaning changed a wild or savage state, or domesticated; ""of"" is defined as a preposition used to indicate derivision, origin, or source; and finally ""shrew"" is defined as a noun meaning a woman of violent temper and speech.  So what we know from this is that the book is about the domestication of a savage or wild woman who is violent in her temper or speech. You see our benevolent hero -- who is likely an Alpha Male of the highest caliber -- found a woman in the woods and decided to teach her english and manners; it's basically Tarzan, except he and Jane have switched places. In the end she becomes very lady like and Bizzaro-Jane weeps for there were no more worlds to conquer.   The End."

The orthodox Pastafarians, true to their name, believed that the whole power of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, blessed be his name, resided in its body, the pasta.  The reformist Salsafarians on the other hand, believed that immense power to come from the essence of the Monster, honoured be his influence, the Sauce.  The Albondigians finally believe that the power of the Our Lord resides in his Holly Meatballs.  We, the Spaghettite are a splinter of the orthodox pastafarians and seek to reunite the religion under its God, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, praised be his existence, and what we know of him, He is Spaghetti, He is Meatballs, He is Bologna, to worship this trinity as a whole instead of what we think is the origin of His Power.  Salsafarians and Albondigians are not easy to convince but some of their members see the value of His Trinity and are working to convince others to come back to the religions origins. The Orthodox however, despite being the ""ancestor"" of us Spaghettites, are a lost cause.  Despite the clear indications that He is Spaghetti, some of us have decided that this isn't true. They have created sects in our core, infiltred us, and temp us with false idols, images of flying lasagnas, hovering pesto tagliatellas, some even dare to show us raviolies!   But the most dangerous of them all, and if you have to remember one, make it this one, are the rigatonians... they hold the key to the carbonara and won't stop using it. They will tempt you, and you shall not succumb. It will be hard, that cream, that cheese, the lardons... It will smell better than anything you'd ever smell, but resist it, for it is no Spaghetti, and it is not Meatballs, and it is not Bologna, and if you try it... you'll never come back to your loved ones."

Please remove your colanders and let us bow our heads in silence as we pray. Let us slurp our loudest slurps to the glory of our most highest supreme Meal.   I am troubled. I know I shouldn't be, for the FSP says  ""worry not, for I am with you. Quite literally, I'm spaghetti, I'm inside you guys."" But still, the thought of the unholy blasphemers haunt me. From our church has in days long gone cults of the occult and unholy sprung. Despite the best efforts of the Italian inquisition, they thrive and leech off of the life force of our beliefs.   They have robbed us. They have robbed us of our true belief and lay claim on our salvation. For in the beginning the most highest Spaghetti Monster of Flying said unto us ""Yeah, um,  I guess you'll be saved or something.""  So tell me,  how dare they claim to be saved? How dare they claim to be the true believers.   For we all know that the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to us in the image of Spaghetti! What more is there to say? The first visions that emerged were not visions of farfalle or rigatoni, as their respective cults would have us believe. Nor was it in the image of those absolutely horrendous and blasphemous Fun Simpsons Macaroni™. Nay, their names shall not be spoken.   Their teachings of twisted, small, un-slurpable pasta shall not go unpunished.  For the day of reckoning is upon us. The age has come that was foretold by the Monster of Flying Spaghettiness, in the words ""Watch out, or I'll, uhh, pour spaghetti sauce over you all.""   Verily, the new dawn is upon us, after which only the worshippers of our Lord in his true spaghettilicious, slurpalicious, al dente-licious form will be left standing.   For those of you who doubt I say this: imagine life in a sea of burning, slimy gnocchi, that have been boiling for thirty minutes. There is no escape. Like quicksand, they will consume you, and you will wither in their shell-like devilish cavities. This is the destiny of the unbelievers.   I will leave you all with a final passage from the Holy Recipe:  And the amount of minutes for boiling spaghetti shall be eight. Not seven, nor nine, but eight. The amount of minutes for boiling shall not be six, unless followed by seven and eight. Eight is the amount of minutes that the spaghetti shall boil."""

Then he shows me this lightsaber, says it was my dad's. The hologram says we gotta go, but I can't and I feel bad.    We see a Jawa wreck, more Raiders I suspect. Ben says they're Imperial troops.  Wait, what about my- oops!    With my aunt and uncle dead, I guess I'll go to space. We talk with some guy and a carpet in a shady place. He wants ten thousand credits, but I just can't afford that. Ben says we'll give him seventeen so I guess that's that.    So then we go to the ship, but troopers start shooting at us. Han start shooting back, and we get on the bus.    Then Han gets inside and we start to lift off. I'm surprised that carpet can drive, his fur sure is soft!    We get to Alderaan, but there's nothing here but rocks. The planet must be destroyed; that really sucks. Then we see a TIE Fighter headed to a small moon. Ben says no, Han says yes, Ben says no, Han says yes, Ben says no, that's no moon.    We start to get a bit closer, then we're caught in a tractor beam. They start to pull us in, I guess we're doomed, it seems. Han manages to hide us in compartments in the floor.

It was clearly an affected motion... but a barely restrained one nonetheless.  ""What's the problem?"" asked Peter. He closed the novel he had been reading - taking time to save his place with a scrap of old homework - and watched as his roommate took fast, shuddering breaths.  ""Malzahar is so fucking OP!"" Rob shouted. ""No fucking skill required! Just fucking rub your fucking face on the fucking buttons and fucking insta-win!""  ""'Insta-win?'""

In truth, he'd picked up more than enough knowledge of the game ""League of Legends"" to follow the essence of Rob's complaints, simply by having spent so much time in the same confined space. An ""ult,"" which ostensibly stood for ""ultimate,"" was a particularly powerful ability of some kind. Each character - of which there were dozens - had one that was unique to them, and access to it was timed in such a way as to prevent players from overusing its power.  ""Fuck!"" Rob shouted again.  ""Okay, look,"" began Peter with a sigh. ""If this Mandrake -""  ""Malzahar!""  ""- Malzahar is so over-powered, then -""  ""Just say 'OP!'"" Rob interrupted, his voice cracking.  Peter sighed again.

Peter's eyes went wide with disbelief as he saw, standing in a corner which had previously only contained empty pizza boxes, the towering figure of a white-robed wizard. The man's eyes scanned his surroundings.  ""Ah,"" the wizard spoke. ""I have been summoned.""  ""You... you're..."" sputtered Peter. ""You're Gandalf!""  A smile accompanied the answer. ""Yes! That is one of my many names.""  ""The fuck?"" coughed Rob. ""He's fucking real?""  Gandalf turned to regard the boy. ""I am quite real, Robert, and you would do well to speak with more eloquence.""  ""What are you fucking -""  The wizard lightly tapped his white staff on the floor, and Rob's sentence was suddenly interrupted by a fit of painful-sounding coughs. ""Now,"" Gandalf continued, ""I understand that you've some question on the nature of magic.""  ""He, uh..."" Peter hesitantly said. ""He was... curious... about why his ultimate had such a long cooldown time when compared to other chara.... to other champions.""  The wizard nodded solemnly. ""It is a problem dealt with by many practitioners. Magic is not simply a blunt instrument, after all; it bends the very nature of reality, altering the rules of the universe for a limited time. Why, my own powers often seem arbitrarily defined, and my most potent of abilities - that of summoning my eagle friends, which I believe you mentioned prior to my arrival - has a 'cooldown time' of sixty or so years.""  ""Why?"" croaked Rob. ""Why the f... uh... why?""  ""It is to give the world a chance to heal,"" Gandalf replied. ""Specifically, to allow it a moment's breath to reassert its influence over one who commands such power. To use an 'ultimate' more frequently would likely cause the wielder to disappear from existence.""  ""So,"" Peter began, ""that's why you only summoned the eagles when Bilbo and the dwarves needed rescuing?""  ""Yes!"" replied the wizard cheerfully.  ""And then again when you needed to escape from Saruman's tower, sixty years later?""  Once again, the wizard nodded.  ""Bullshit!"" shouted Peter. ""No, I'm sorry, I have to agree with Rob on this. Your powers are arbitrarily defined! If you have a sixty-year cooldown time, then why were you able to summon the eagles to rescue Frodo and Sam from Mount Doom?!""  ""I should think that would be obvious,"" Gandalf answered.  Peter folded his arms. ""How do you explain it, then?""  ""Yeah,"" Rob squeaked. ""How?""  The wizard smiled and tapped his staff on the floor again... and from beyond the walls of the dormitory, a distant screech of a gargantuan bird became audible. With a flourish of motion, Gandalf strutted to the room's one window, slid it open, and began to climb outside. Peter rushed to follow, and saw what he'd suspected - what he'd hoped - that he would: An enormous eagle swooped from the sky, and with no more difficulty than a horse might have in bearing a rider, accepted the wizard onto its back. There was a brief pause as the two companions greeted one another, after which they took flight and soared in the direction of the clouds.  ""Aren't you going to tell me?!"" Peter shouted.  ""Yes!"" Gandalf called back. Already, his voice was growing distant... but his final words, though faint, were still clear:  ""My abilities are all reset when I respawn!"""

Aragorn: Kinda hard when mid sucks balls  Gandalf: wtf i'm carrying u all  Legolas: if you're carrying why do you never use ult in teamfights  Gimli: yeah remember when we got ganked and he went in 1v1  Samwise: Come on guys, he actually sacrificed himself, it worked out!  Samwise: Aragorn managed to counterjungle Balrog so it was worth  Aragorn: thanks to this noob mid no teamwork  Gimli: yeah but i coulda killed balrog if gandalf just waited  Gimli: but no he gets ahead cause gandalf feeds him a death  Gimli: so he hit 6 first and then we get destroyed by his stupid OP ult  Gandalf: yeah well boromir's a better top laner than gimli  Gimli: wtf they banned boromir you retard  Legolas: i cant believe he wasted his ult just to get back to lane quicker  Gandalf: ok ok ok  Samwise: Maybe ranked isn't the best place to try out a new champ...

Gandalf: ye and while u were arguing earlier i managed to solo their jungler  Gimli: wat  Gandalf: its just a shame that our noob jungler didnt react  Samwise: The death timers are huge this late, now Balrog's waiting to respawn we should go.  Legolas: no can do gotta farm up i just got my recurve bow  Samwise: Minions are pushing in and we don't have time to farm up. We could probably just bumrush mid.  Aragorn: ye well if someone had their ult we could all be at their inhib now and game would be over  Gandalf: fk off  Gimli: can sum1 backdoor  Samwise: That's not really a good idea, if anyone else gets caught out by Balrog they'll get deleted and we won't win a 4v5  Legolas: wont win a 4v5 bicth look at my kda i'm smurf my main is ThranduilMirkwood i'm dia 5 lolking me  Aragorn: lol what kind of stupid name is that  Aragorn: is it EUNE are u a kurwa gtfo the Arda server  Legolas: wtf stfu its from an anime  Gimli: oh man a weeaboo look out  Samwise: Guys please can we stop arguing? Their death timers are almost up  Samwise: ...  Samwise: Gandalf, what's your ult cd now?  Gandalf: 55 years  Legolas: why the fk is it so long  Gandalf: u know Twisted Fate's ult  Gimli: is that the card guy  Gandalf: ye he has a global ult and it has huge cd  Gandalf: they had to nerf it cuz it was too strong and he could tp anywhere and it wasnt even his ult  Aragorn: so what  Gandalf: if my ult had a shorter cd i'd prob be a better jungler than u  Gandalf: i could gank any lane and get so fed it'd be like lcs  Aragorn: lmao ap mage jungle next u'll tell me u play Karma jungle  Samwise: That's actually viable if you're good enough  Gandalf: ty Samwise see   Gimli: why did u pick someone with such a shitty ult   Gandalf: practising for when they buff him  Gandalf: rito pls  Legolas: if his ult is so strong why would they buff him  Gandalf: heard C9 Lemonnation has been practising him support  Gimli: who the fk is that  Legolas: lol do u never watch lcs  Gimli: wtf is lcs  Legolas: lol and u think ur pro never watched a pro game  Aragorn: lol u guys are stupid korean scene is better  Samwise: Balrog up in 10  Legolas: kk we should turtle til Gandalf ult is up then 5 man backdoor  Gimli: well i need 1 more item  Legolas: pfff  Samwise: With all the minions pushing all the lanes, if we don't get caught out we'll make bank!  Gandalf: soz guys  Outcome: Blue Team Win  Despite Gandalf's ult not being up in time, the team managed to put aside their quarrels. Working together, Gimli and Legolas took the middle inhibitor. Aragorn took top and Gandalf, with his overpowered skills compensating for his gimped ult thanks to the new patch, took bot. While they distracted the enemy team, Samwise managed to get in and backdoor as the enemy couldn't get back in time. Also, Samwise quietly reported Aragorn for Verbal Abuse: Racism, and Aragorn got a 50 game chat restriction. But that's a story for another time."

I can't help but picture Sauron's eye exploding after Samwise backdoored the Red Team while everyone else was busy.  My one tiny point of contention is that Twisted Fate's ultimate - even when it was his ultimate - had to be nerfed a second time. The vision is still global, but the teleport range was reduced to about a fifth of the map size.  Honestly, it didn't distract from anything at all... I just have a certain affinity for Twisted Fate.  Well done. Very well done."

""Yes, I wish to focus on humans, Balan said you can get a lot of energy from them and IAD adores them, which makes them better to screw with""  So you wish to target humans specifically... I wouldn't see any reason to try that on the insipid flesh-sacks. For one, they can actually fight back and kick you out using a variety of different methods. As you know and said, IAD cosies up to them all the time and despite all our efforts to have him abandon the bastards to rot in a world made and controlled by us, he still carries that lovey-duvey attitude despite nearly wiping them out a few times, and the little buggers use it all the time to their advantage. So unless you wish to have your MA-OF-FAS handed back to you by IAD or Michael himself, because one of them snitched on you, fine by me.  ""but I thought you harvested plenty of energy from them""  Yes, yes, I did. But that was as a Succubus. [...] Yes, yes laugh all you want, I took the cowards way out, but boy, do you get a fuckton of energy for free, and they want you to do it.  ""So have you ever entered and possessed a human via contact with them in that way?""  Well, no, I'm not sure if that's even possible, and then, they'll probably kick you out by them swan-diving in to a extra-saltly, running stream of holy water.  ""Did you actually try and fight your removal from the human that you said you tried to possess one time? Because I hear that's a pretty easy thing to do.""  I... well... I-It's much harder because humans don't have names, while we do, humans can easily throw us out by the name, while we have to go in to the soul and try and seize it oursel—  ""But I thought that humans can have up to triple the amount of names we do...""  Wait, Really...? I-I mean of course, silly me, why could I forget something so important?  (Listen, I was just practicing my lying on you so I get to actually cause some chaos and work to HOMIL GE-IAD's plans properly. If you want to know how to do the possession thing without me sounding like one of those stupid boot-licking humans in the big temples they like to make; go talk to Lamia or Moloch or somebody, because you seem to know more than I do about it)"
explainlikeIAmA,37kgz2,AtlasJan,2,Thu May 28 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Enochian:       Enochian is a name often applied to an occult or angelic language recorded in the private journals of John Dee and his colleague Edward Kelley in late 16th-century England.  Kelley was a spirit medium who worked with Dee in his magical investigations. The men claimed that the language was revealed to them by the Enochian angels. The language is integral to the practice of Enochian magic.  The language found in Dee and Kelley's journals encompasses a limited textual corpus, only some of it with English translations. Several linguists, notably Donald Laycock, have studied Enochian, and argue against any extraordinary features in the language.  Dee's journals did not describe the language as ""Enochian"", instead preferring descriptors like ""Angelical"", the ""Celestial Speech"", the ""Language of Angels"", the ""First Language of God-Christ"", the ""Holy Language"" or ""Adamical"" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The term ""Enochian"" comes from Dee's assertion that the Biblical Patriarch Enoch had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.  The title for the song Faaip de Oiad, by American rock band Tool translates to Voice of God in Enochian.

They're basically thinking machines, and there's one in pretty much everything these days. How they work is that they are made up of a big collection of billions of little circuits - yes, we can do that - no, that doesn't mean they take up a few acres, because we can make the wires around 30 1/000,000,000 ths of a  meter -that's about 3'4"" - the meter, not the wires - Look, haven't you got a metric ruler?  No, everyone except the US uses metric. The US? They're the former colonies of Britain. Just listen, will you?  So we have these circuits made of tiny wires. Some time ago, people figured out how to make these circuits do mathematics, like adding and multiplying. They also figured out how to store information by using capacitors and magnets, and they made selections of instructions for these primitive thinking machines - Yes, like the one Babbage made - No, you won't lose your bet on it never catching on, because you'll be dead by the time it does.   So, these machines were quite big at the start, taking up a small building or so, but eventually they got cheaper and until first universities and governments could get them - Why? To make calculations very quickly while designing and building things- and soon banks could use them to buy and sell shares easily and eventually, in the 1970s and 80s, the general public could access them. By the 1990s, they were quite popular, and big networks of linked machines could transfer information - like pictures, music and moving pictures or news - all around the world. In the 2000s, people started buying mobile telephones, which had little wirelesses in them to allow them to talk to each other from far away.  Eventually, people started merging computers and mobile telephones, and that's how smartphones came about.  What on earth is that? A slide rule? You use it to do multiplication?  I've never heard of that. How does it work? How quaint!"

explainlikeIAmA,372xan,RedRiverValley,84,Sun May 24 10:54:33 2015 UTC,"In the shadows of the hallway, Lance Constable Roche-Moutonnée took a deep and careful breath. Being a fully grown male troll, his body only actually required oxygen once every fifteen minutes or so, and even then it was more of a request than a requirement.   Nonetheless, there are times when you just take a deep, careful breath.   He let it out and knocked gently on the door.   ""Er... Mister Vimes, sir?""  His Grace Commander Samuel Vimes, Duke of Ankh, looked up from his bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich.   This was an unusual occurrence: Lady Sybill's devotion to devastatingly healthy cooking had transformed his traditional BLT (which, with proportional representation, had been more of a BBBBBBBBBBLT) into something more along the lines of a LTLTLTBLTLTLT. It was only by the application of mind-over-matter techniques that would seriously impress any of the little orange mystics in the high Ramtops that he could convert the resulting monstrosity of fiber into something he wanted to eat.  As his eyes refocused on the temporal world, leaving the fantasy of grease and burnt crunchy bits behind, the fatigue of two solid weeks on the job asserted itself. His face sagged visibly, and he surveyed the recruit with the gaze of a certified public accountant being presented with a shoebox that - somewhere, surely, under all the coupons - contains the last nine years of grocery receipts.  ""That's Commander Vimes, Lance Constable.What can I do for you?""  ""Sorry, Sir. S'only, I heard Sargent Colon say Mister Vimes and I t'ought-""  ""There's some that have earned it. What do you need from me?""  ""Sorry, Commander Vimes Commander, s'just Captain Carrot told me to report to you on account of getting a club thrown at me sir.""  Commander Vimes looked up with somewhat more concern, his eyes doing the quick one-two full body scan of policemen everywhere. They naturally gravitated to the hips, the legs, and under the arms - the places where a weapon could be concealed in the troll's baggy vest and kilt. No, he thought, this is one of my own officers. Still, especially these days, you never knew.  ""Assault on an officer is a very serious charge. Any damage done?""  ""Oh no, sir, superficial at best. It was lovely old mahogany, sir. Isn't a club like that going to get damaged just getting thrown once. A slap of varnish and it'll be good as new.""  Commander Vimes gazed blankly at the Lance Constable. He liked troll officers. They were literal, they didn't tend to get bogged down in specifics before starting an assignment, and no one could beat them in a scrap. There was this tendency to odd priorities, though.   And, of course, the other trouble.  ""Igor down in the basement can do marvels with a bit of grout if you need it. But Captain Carrot wouldn't have sent you to me for a simple C-18B, what else happened?""  C-18B refers to the Assault of Active Guard Officers Act, AM 1231, subheading 48, concerning assault with furniture, food items, deadly weapons, undeadly weapons, live dragons, and the insensate bodies of other guard officers. It is the single most cited ordinance by the entire Ankh-Morpork police force.  ""Well, sir, it was trolls rioting, see? And they were rioting in Quarry Lane, sir, not in Ankh or by the tracks or in a dwarf neighborhood or anywhere them as is bad to 'em lives. Their own neighborhood sir, burning building and looting shops and-""  Vimes stood up, very slowly. With unerring aim, his hand floated out, found the end of the lone remaining piece of bacon in his sandwich, and twitched it out of its vegetable grave and into his pocket. Just a few years ago, the idea of troll houses burning down would have been ridiculous: they had lived in simple structures of stone and concrete. But no, now Ankh Morpork's rising troll middle class would have shingles and timber or nothing.   Very sturdy shingles and timber, though.  ""Where should they have been rioting, Lance Constable? Where would make sense?""  ""Well..."" tiny beads of the viscous rock oil that is the troll answer to sweat appeared on his brow, ""here, sir, seems like. I mean to say, it were a Watch officer who-""  ""Walk with me, Lance Constable.""  Vimes Left the office with surprising speed. Lance Constable Roche-Moutonnée hurried after him. He found him standing outside, looking out vacantly over Pseudopolis Yard. He was smoking a cigar.""  ""Smoke?"" he asked absently.  ""Oh, thank you, sir, but you know tobacco and trolls, its...""  The oblong in Vimes' nonsmoking hand was not brown and - like any other organic substance - scentless to Roche-Moutonnée. It was the crinkly, silvery shape of a troll cigar. A good one too, by the Molybdenum smell of it hanging in the air. He took it, standing in paralyzed terror as Vimes held a match to it. Smoke billowed away from his face as it caught.  ""Thank you, sir. 's a very good cigar, sir, you can really taste the antimony.""  Vimes nodded vaguely and set out across the square, moving with the gentle and efficient bob of a policeman on his beat. Proceeding. Roche-Moutonnée stumbled to find the stride that would allow him to match pace.  ""You don't talk like most trolls, Lance Constable. You're not from around here?""  ""No, sir, my family's from the Quirm hills originally. Come here for to seek a better life in the land of opportunity.""  Vimes nodded. He turned on his heel and surveyed Pseudopolis yard from the far side. Normally, the square would be bustling at this time of day. Today, it was bare. Even CMOT Dibbler had not been able to work up the optimism for a day of sales. Everyone was keeping away, but not much was happening. Away across the square, two children with sticks darted between buildings.  ""Land of opportunity?""  ""Oh yes, sir.""  ""Have you been down to the tanty recently?""  ""No, sir, I'm mostly on day watch down around the Merchant's Guild.""  ""Well, on any given day it's easily half trolls in there. Did you know the tanty is the single biggest buyer of pumice and coke in the city? A lot of hungry mouths to feed, and most still awaiting trial.""  ""But, sir, tha's criminals! They all go to the tanty.""  ""Yes, for a bit. Some get out sooner than others. And the patrician tends to take him time setting trial dates for trolls. Something about the dread of the law being as important as the law itself.""  ""Oh.""  ""At this moment, the tanty contains not only its usual compliment of inmates, but six of my officers as well. Corporals Manford and Copperaxe, Constable Of The Pebble, The Dust, and Lance Constable Ironhelm. Oh, and constables Gneiss and Malachite, though everyone seems to forget about them. What it does not, at the moment, contain, is one Esker, a butcher's assistant from Whalebone Lane who never made it that far. That's why people are angry. The Patrician is slow when it suits him, and the dwarf officers can be a bit enthusiasticwhen they're new no matter what I do, but if prisoners never get their chance at all...""  ""But... their own neighborhood, Commander Vimes.""  ""Because, if every now and then a bright young troll didn't fail to make it to the tanty, those neighborhoods could have been so much more, Lance Constable.""  They smoked in silence for a moment. The wind swept around the square, piling the fog into towers and waves, stained just slightly by the memory of smoke. Across the city, shouts and bangs echoed. Roche-Moutonnée knew they had to be coming from Quarry Lane, but fog does funny things to sound and they seemed to be coming from all around him.  ""Commander Vimes?""  Vimes turned away from the square and moved off in the direction of Quarry Lane. Walking gently. Proceeding.  ""Yes?""  ""Commander Vimes, I heard as it was Sargent Colon on duty that night.""  Roche-Moutonnée could see nothing of Vimes but his shape, stiffening in the haze of fog and mingled smokes.  ""Sargent Colon is an officer, Lance Constable. He will want the law to be served.""  The shape of Vimes receded into the haze. Roche-Moutonnée hurried after him. The Silicon Anti-Defamation League had had a lot to say recently. They had even asked him to speak, as a representative of both the law and immigrant communities. But they were, to borrow a troll idiom, accosting travelers on the wrong bridge.  They said that, somewhere under the alchemists' guild, there was a man who had discovered how to turn lead into gold. They said that he was kept closed up in a tiny room, and only given enough materials to keep the guild afloat without causing too much suspicion. Whether the man actually existed or not wasn't particularly important to Roche-Moutonnée at the moment. Lead to gold wasn't such a trick after all.   Commander Vimes could turn silicon to copper - just like that."

The Watch that Vimes made would never have killed a man so blatantly, the Beast that Vimes guards the world from would never be let off the chain for something so simple and normal and understandable as a man or dwarf or troll being hunted and caught in the wrong place and at the wrong time. That Watch would never have killed a man like Freddy Gray in the first place.  Think you must mean the day watch son, Vimes and the Night Watch are BETTER than that. He isnt Knock or Quirke, he isn't one of the Cable Street Particulars, deciding criminality then forcing confessions. Vimes is better, Pratchett was better and this story just defiles the slightly scuffed and knocked about but still grubbily cleaned off soul of a man like Vimes.  The idea that Vimes even by way of his Watch would be party to that kind of atrocity is anathema to everything that Vimes stood for.  Good job with the style, but the soul man, the soul aint there, you're written a hollow empty thing, gilded and beautiful but missing the heart."
explainlikeIAmA,372xan,Foehammer87,4,Tue May 26 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"The going spare happened. This is set two weeks after the incident, as I alluded to in the story. Vimes can't guarantee that every person in a Watch of hundreds will do the right thing all the time - no one can. Good institutions can attract bad and scared and untrustworthy people. So, is this scenario plausible? Yes, I think so. Vimes' test would be in responding to darkness in his own watch. No institution remains pure forever."

Today's police force hasn't gone bad, it continues in the pattern it was established, anti poor, anti poc institution designed to protect the wealthy from the masses. It is essentially the Day Watch, the very thing Vimes designed his Watch NOT to be. He would have to be DEAD to allow his Watch to stray so far.   I know it sounds pedantic, but you stand from under the umbrella looking out, confused when people tell you it's been raining shit forever. The nightmare situation that Vimes describes in The Night Watch is exactly what we have now, except there is no revolution brewing, no patrician waiting to out maneuver the 1% and no Vimes being trained to set it all right.  Today's police force behaviour is the kind that sent Vimes down a bottle of bearhuggers. We live in the land of the Day Watch."

This quarter, banana and rice production increased by 33%, as did potato yields which increased 27%. Wheat production had a modest 8% increase when compared to the modified output last year.  Now it has been brought to my attention anonymously that certain comrades have been questioning the purity of our food supply.  This comes at a shock to us! We all have worked very hard to produce only the most scientifically advanced and logically produced food sources, surpassing yields throughout history. Yet these misguided individuals continue to spread rumors and false information, disrupting the body politic.   These comrades have made outrageous and contradictory claims using false facts. For example, one ""diet"" claims that eating less carbs will lead to weight loss, when another ""diet"" claims that the same goal can be achieved eating only fruits and nuts. Yet other diets castigate grain protein as poison and toxic to the body.   Let me assure you Comrades that none of these claims can be further from the truth. In fact, the only scientific and logical method to maintaining a healthy diet is to eat a well balanced meal, supplied by state supported companies such as Monsanto and ConAgra, with plenty of exercise.   This is the logical, and therefore the most patriotic choice. We encourage all true members of the Nation to put shame to these decadent and incorrect ways of thinking.   -END STATEMENT-"

Actually, scratch that last one, don't use hippopotamus.  Let's say six characters, max, all right?  Okay, seven.    I mean, I don't want you to get the wrong idea here.  I'm not propositioning you with my dick pic.  I'm not one of those guys who send girls dick pics over the Internet.  Well, apart from the fact that I'm sending you a dick pic now.  But I emphasize again, very emphatically, that I am not looking for some sort of physical intimacy with you.  I'm just sending photographic evidence that I do, in fact, have intact genitals.  Of considerable size, if I may say so myself.    I mean, there's nothing wrong with wanting physical intimacy with you.  You're a very attractive woman, and we've been on a couple of very nice dates so far.  I certainly would not be averse to going further, some day in the future.  But it is not this day.  Oh god I'm sorry I didn't mean to quote Aragorn there, it just sort of slipped out.  It must've been because Aragorn's so manly, and so am I, because I have fully functioning testes, making all this testosterone in my veins.  Want me to send a picture of me showing my abs?

But for now, I'm just not that comfortable with it yet, okay?  You can respect that, right?  We've all got boundaries, and right now my boundary is drawn right before doing the horizontal mambo-jambo.  Just not in the right frame of mind for that.  Sorry.

Secondly, despite having a working, active, and very functional schlong, I am currently uninterested in using it on you.  Err, with you.  Saying ""on you"" sounds so rapey.

Ducks were cool in 2014, when hipsters realized chickens had gone mainstream.  Same egg laying awesomeness, more suspender wearing street cred. Then they took the slow food, urban farm movement to the next level with at home timber production with the beavers. Now it seems like every wanna-be homesteader has a dammed river in their back yard and whenever you come over for a burger it's all ""Oh those woodchips in the smoker?  Chucky spat those out yesterday while he was chewing some new fence posts.""   You, of course, do not want beaver spit flavoring your smoker.  You do not wear suspenders, and your facial hair cannot be contained to one tiny moustache.  Your beard makes those beavers feel insecure about their pelts.   Beaver produced woodwork?  Please.  You have a woodshop that would make Nick Offerman jealous. Your egg-layers of choice have been bred not only for great egg production but for fantastic feathery style. You aren't afraid of technology and science, you bend the world to your will with them.   Get an animal as amazingly designed as the rest of your life: the platypus. This little guy takes the duck beak to the next level, using his to sense electrical currents underwater. Think mammalian birth is overrated? Platypus reproduce in neat, clean egg form. He improves on the beaver - smaller, won't destroy your backyard - but keeps that well engineered tail and nice fur. Plus, he's got some pluck. A fox (or jealous neighbor) that tries to get a hold of your platypus is going to get stabbed in the neck* with a venomous spur.    Ducks are boring. Beavers are sloppy.

We've tried to be cool and be hospitable given your... displacement, but you and that goddamn owl eat so much and all you've done is watch old Bewitched reruns.  NO THE TV ISN'T SOME DARK MAGIC ITS A GODDAMN TV.  Sorry. I'm just really stressed and I'd appreciate it if you ran to the store and grabbed dinner.  A store? You know, like a market stand. How do you not know what... Whatever. It's a place where a person sells wares for money.  Oh god, are you kidding me? Money is an object with objective value that is traded for goods and services. I told you that last week when I asked if you could pay to replace my skillet after you tried to turn it into gold. I keep telling you. Alchemy is still not a thing.   Dude, please just go to the market and get dinner. Here's 30 bucks and a list of what we need. Find someone wearing an apron with the name of the store on it - Again, that's ""stop and shop"" - and give them these items. They'll see that fucking hat and know you need assistance. Please please just do th-  zap RIBBIT zap  GODDAMMIT"

You need to shoot us in the maximally efficient terroristic order, or METO.   Generally the top of the list is children, followed by attractive women, followed by the elderly, followed by the disabled followed by married men, followed by single men...   Yes, I am single, why do you ask?   Anyway, you need to assign a point value to each hostage, because an attractive elderly disabled woman is going to get way more play on Nancy Grace than, say, a single computer geek with no children...   No, I don't have children either, why?   Anyway, once each hostage has a point value, you'll need to sort them by point total. Now the easy way is a simple insert sort, just insert each new entry into the list where it belongs, but as there are quite a lot of us that will take forever. You could do a quicksort, just pick one at random and put everybody ahead or behind them based on their score, then organize the groups ahead and behind in the same way until they're sorted.   ... No, I'm not stalling here, I'm trying to help you do your job better! Don't you care about striking the most possible fear into the heart of the western people as possible?   Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, you could do a heap sort... Just arrange everybody in a tree, start at the bottom, compare each hostage with the one above them, swap then if the lower one has a higher value, then at the end shoot the person on top and start again, which you can do because it's an in place algorithm.   Or you can do a good bogosort, just randomize everybody and check to see if they're sorted, if not start over.  ..it is too a real thing! Wikipedia it if you don't believe me!   See! Totally real! I know what I'm talking about!   Well, let's see, you could also do a sealsort...   What's that?

explainlikeIAmA,36epky,Lizard,3,Tue May 19 12:23:42 2015 UTC,I think the best sorting algorithm in this situation would likely be: Efficiently identify and remove items from the set until the set is sorted.

Yeah I know, you'd probably never finish sorting us, but you did almost let us get sorted that way...   If you won't allow us to be bogosorted, perhaps you'd let us all stand in a random order first?  I'll just walk around asking people to switch randomly with me and their partners.  Can we settle on a bubble sort in this scenario?  That should buy us some time...  Oh wait, you won't let us mix up randomly first?  That's not good.  The worst case would probably be avoided.  How about if I pitch the idea of a quick sort, but you yourself have to keep track of the recursion stack?

Then, along with the UK (those fatigant des îles), we went on a war against Germany (big Prussia). The Russians tried to help us too but failed and threw away their king.

Then, we went close to be like Russia for a while until 1939 where a wannabe Napoleon in Germany tried to conquer the world.

He was eloquent and very well read, willing to point out all of the local landmarks and lost souls as we traveled through the Underworld. There were a few occasions where I thought we were getting lost, but it turned out each was an opportunity to talk with the locals. I was impressed because I heard the place was a tourist trap and that once you get stuck there, it isn't likely you'll make it to anywhere meaningful. Just proves the value of a good guide.  The rooms were shit and the sites kind of lackluster, although surprising. The people were nice, always willing to explain what they were doing or how they were locked into everlasting torment. Usually Virgil had to translate for me as it was all in Latin, but man he had a way with words. Gates opened everywhere we went. Some of those places were pretty sketchy though.

Martin presents: AN EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER  EPILOGUE  The wind tugged and tugged at Cedric's hat, causing him to fasten it down with the laces holding it together. He'd grown accustomed to the winds of the Vale, but never of the sounds of crumple and splatter. Nearly every other day he'd been forced to clean up the bodies that piled into his farmland from the castle; all sent by that wench queen Lysa - until one day Lysa herself came tumbling down herself. The bodies never stop flowing in though. Routinely sent by this crippled prince of his.  In the days of the mad king when Cedric, a man of nothing to his name acquired this farmland for dirt-cheap, he considered himself a man of honor, and thusly gave each and every body that plummeted onto his farmland a proper burial. Now though, he considered himself a much more practical man, one who merely picks up each body and uses it as fertilizer for the crops that feed the Erie. If only these ""high-and-holy"" lords knew the lettuces they were spooning into their mouths were in fact their very own brothers at arms. Cedric once thought.  This particular day was gloomy and cold. A light rain had descended from the sky, providing an all-encompassing mist that widdled its way around each of his joints. Cedric took a look up at the gloomy sky to observe the state of the whether, when in the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of another body, falling down into the patch of dirt where his crops no longer grow. He winced in anticipation of the splatter, and the vicious ""craacccckkk"" to come. The sound came as more of a thump, than anything he'd heard before. Cedric prepared his conscious for what he was to see, and slowly inched towards the body that had just crashed to the ground.  No... no it couldn't be! The farmer thought before retching back in horror. Our very own prince, tossed straight out the moon door. Indeed it was the smashed face of Robert Arryn that lay staring at him with his dead eyes. Panic writhed inside of him as thoughts of terror rushed though his mind. Th-that new man must have been the cause of this. That Balish bastard, he must have killed everyone, Lysa too But before he could finish his thoughts, before he could call for help, a second body came crashing down on him from above, breaking his spine. Oh Gods be good, I'm done for now. He looked at the dead body before him - one with a triangular mustache, and thick straight black hair. Wait, that *is Peter Balish. Who could be responsible for this? Who could it be!?* As Cedric ghasped his last breath the thought finally crossed his mind: The murderer of my prince... it-it must be... Lady Sansa..."

SCP-2870 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. The cell is not to be opened for any reason.  Description: SCP-2870 is a series of anomalous autonomous animatronics, designed in the style of humanoid animal mascots for the ""Freddy Fazbear"" chain of restaurants and arcades.  When fully assembled and unobserved for 2 consecutive hours, the animatronics enter an active state, attempting to ambush lone human targets and stun them with high-pitched screams. After stunning their target, SCP-2870 will drag the inert body of their target back to the site of their activation and seek a spare suit built to cover their metal endoskeleton, forcing the victim inside. This process is invariably fatal, often resulting in [REDACTED] and collapsed [||||||||||||]. If no such parts can be found, [DATA EXPUNGED] whereupon the animatronic returns to its active mode.  SCP-2870-beta-8 does not follow these behaviors exactly - upon activation and ambush, [FURTHER INFORMATION RESTRICTED TO SECURITY LEVEL 4]  Acquisition: SCP-2870-alpha were discovered in the recently-closed Freddy Fazbear's Pizza establishment following the death of the night-shift security guard and reports of music coming from the condemned building. After the deaths of two junior research assistants, the animatronics were dismantled, and it was deduced that their anomalous properties are unique to the parts that comprise them and only manifest when fully assembled.  SCP-2870-beta were discovered in the ruins of another establishment of the franchise, the full name of which could no longer be found in public or private records. Due to the correlation with 2870-alpha, the same procedures were followed and found successful, and the animatronics were designated 2870-beta.  SCP-2870-gamma was found in the burned-out ruins of a ""haunted-house"" attraction based on the morbid history of the Fazbear chain. While it was bot found to correspond with any characters associated with the marketing of Fazbear Entertainment, its behavior was recognized as identical to previously encountered animatronics and it was designated 2870-gamma; however, attempts to dismantle and store it with the others resulted in unexpected activation. SCP-2870-gamma attempted to strangle a junior researcher before being strapped to a table. Partial disassembly revealed long-decayed human remains where the other animatronics had robotic endoskeletons; how SCP-2870-gamma was able to move at all despite lacking internal structure is yet unknown. SCP-2870-gamma was sealed in a box and stored with other animatronics, but freed itself by unknown means and was found attempting to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Containment procedures were updated accordingly.    Please note that I fucking hate FNAF and its creator, but I can't help thinking how much it resembles a pre-containment SCP."

As the fissile material exceeds critical mass, it produces enough internal neutrons to start a chain reaction. As solid atoms split apart, a truly mind-boggling amount of energy is released.   The nuclear fission weapon was invented following research into life, the universe and everything (the researchers were apparently unaware that it has already been determined to be 42), which was often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess' undergarments simultaneously age ten thousand years faster than the rest of her clothes in accordance with the theory of relativity.  Many respectable physicists said they weren't going to stand for that sort of thing, partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.  Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they encountered when trying to construct a machine which could liberate the atomic energy needed to cause destruction on a usable scale in one go, rather than one atom at a time, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a reaction was virtually impossible.  Then one day, a student who'd been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: ""if such a reaction is a virtual impossibility, it much be because the chances of a million or a billion atoms exploding at once are virtually zero, but if you could get the destruction of one to trigger the destruction of its neighbour, and so on, you would have a chain reaction. In the end a good sized fraction of the atoms would explode at once. So all I have to do in order to make it work is to work exactly how much material I need, then blow up one or two atoms to start the reaction off, squeeze them all together really hard, and then run for my life"".  He did this and was rather startled to discover that he'd managed to create the concept for the long sought-after nuclear fission bomb out of a weekends work. It startled him even more when, after he was awarded a position in the Führer's main research department, he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists, who had finally realised that the one the one thing they really couldn't stand was a nazi smartass."

The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. Governments restrict speech with varying limitations. Common limitations on speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, hate speech, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, right to privacy, right to be forgotten, public security, public order, public nuisance, campaign finance reform and oppression. Whether these limitations can be justified under the harm principle depends upon whether influencing a third party's opinions or actions adversely to the second party constitutes such harm or not.  Also includes 'you can't try to manipulate factual evidence to manipulate someone to say a particular thing (that is real information) to claim that they're projecting.'"

I’m just asking you to help me scale an office building and steal a tiny, miniscule source code. That’s it. Just a little breaking and entering. We’re not talking about genocide, we’re just talking about borrowing something without the intention of giving it back. You borrow things, right? Didn’t you borrow a loan from the bank to help me start our video game company? It’s no different than that, except we’re borrowing from Konami rather than a bank. And we’re not going to pay them back. Ever.  Stop crying, just stop it. I’m not going to make you do anything you don’t want to do, probably. Stop and think for one minute: do you remember Metal Gear? How about Contra? Castlevania? Silent Hill? Tokimeki Memorial 4 Chu? I actually don’t even remember that last one, I’m not even sure it’s a video game—but the others. You remember those. And you know what? That’s all they’re going to be if we don’t do this: memories. We’re not stealing this source code because we want to make a significant amount of money off of a highly anticipated sequel. We’re stealing this because we’re trying to save a beloved company. Also, yes, we’re partially doing it for the money.   Do you remember P.T.? Do you remember what it felt like the first time you were chased down the hall by that terrifying woman? How about the time she chased you down the other hall? And don’t make me remind you about the time you ended up chasing yourself down all of the halls because you thought she was chasing you. Didn’t you ever want to know what was going on at a deeper level? Didn’t you ever find yourself curious as to why such a terrifying figure decided you were not fit to live? Was it because you were too attractive? Well, not you per se, but someone in general? Perhaps it was because you had stolen something from her, like a phone charger or a hunk of Virginia ham. Or maybe it was just because she didn’t like your heritage. Whatever the reason, unless we break into Konami’s headquarters and steal that source code for P.T. right now, we may never find out. In fact, we won’t find out. No one will find out. And it’ll be your fault.  I’m not asking you to do this as your superior, as your employer, as the man who pays your wages. I am asking you to do this as a friend, as someone who remembers the fond years of playing some of Konami’s greatest games. With your help, we can stop this shift from good to evil; we can stop a once-beloved company from catering to the addicted, and  possibly undead, mobile gaming crowd. All I ask is that you help me break in, steal that one, measly source code, and then get out. Nothing else, that’s it. Simple, painless, and no one gets hurt. Afterward, though, I might also need you to assassinate Hideki Hayakawa. And I’ll fire you if you refuse."

My Leader, things in your year of 1940 are surely glorious; your victory over France seems assured, and your lightning attack will soon cross the Channel to deal with the perfidious British. But things are even more glorious in this, year 70 of the Greater German Reich. Your magnificent capital, Germania, is the wonder of the civilised world, the philosophy of National Socialism has spread across Europe, the Jewish poison has been all but eradicated from the Earth, and our Empire stretches from the East Cost of America to the borders of Japanese-administered China. But, beware my Leader, we have sent this message back through time to reach you with a dire warning! Anti-German forces, perhaps organised by the last secret remnants of Jewry, have sent a message back in time to try and halt your efforts, containing a battle plan that may grant your enemies victory; thus, we have sent this message back to you, to ensure your victory. Our greatest military minds have convened, analysing the enemies plan, and, though we do not wish to second guess your tactical genius, we have humbly created a list of suggestions that we believe you must stick to if you are to ensure that this enemy plan is crushed:  1) You must open up a second front as soon as possible, before the end of the year if you can. Stalin's bolshevistic empire is weak, and the slavic rabble will easily be done away with in a sustained assault before winter sets in. We suggest you concentrate your forces particularly on the city of Stalingrad, as taking this almost undefended target will surely provide a fatal psychological blow to the weak-willed Georgian dog.  2) Declare war against the United States as soon as politically expedient. The vigour of the Japanese empire will crush the effete capitalist wretches in very short order, and you must move quickly to ensure our empire a good hold on the North American continent. You should urge your Japanese allies to attack Pearl Harbour during the first half of December 1941, when all the American carriers are sure to be stationed there, crippling what paltry sea power they possess in the Pacific.  3) In armaments, concentrate on quality over quantity. Whilst your enemies churn out masses of cheap, ill-made, faulty armaments, put your faith in the best engineered, most mechanically complex devices. Also, do not neglect your wonder weapons; though these projects will be costly, and draw away massive amounts of resources from other areas for little apparent gain at first, in the long run they will certainly win you the war.  4) The Enigma and Lorenz cipher codes are utterly unbreakable, even with our advanced technology. Rely on these secret writing systems for all communications.  5) Any enemy counter-offensive against the European continent, should Britain not fall within a year (as we hope) will certainly be directed at Calais, and any attack elsewhere will undoubtedly be a diversion.  Follow these 5 points, My Leader, and you cannot fail to achieve victory. Hail Hitler!"

When I was observing the future in the original timeline my neighbor was Steve. He must of found the Delorean and taken knowledge of the future and given it back to his past self! He must have changed the course of history by introducing technology at a different pace! If he changed it to much, there might be a future causality paradox that could mean the end of time!

Anyway, Winter is coming, and you need to store enough food to survive it.   So you get a whole bunch of nuts and stuff that will keep, and you find a place to hide it.  Maybe you wrap 'em in animal skins and dig a hole and cover it over.  This is your ""bank account""; it's where you keep everything that you don't have right now.  Now you only tell the location to one other person, in case you forget.  He's blind though, so you use a secret word that will let him know that you're you, so he can tell you where it is.  He's the ""bank.""  Now let's say that somebody else learns your secret word.  Now they can pretend they're you, get the location, and go take your food while you're not there!  That's identity theft.  And that's why I'm here.  Somebody stole my identity, racked up huge gambling debts, and I needed to book it as far away from civilization as I can get while my bank sorts it out.  ""Why would you share your secret word with a blind man?  That seems exceedingly insecure.  And how do you know the blind man himself didn't simply tell someone where your nuts were and the two of them divided it among them?""  ""Well, the blind man and the nuts are a metaphor.  I give my nuts to the blind man because the blind man makes it so that I can get them where ever I am from devices that I tell my secret word to.""  ""The blind man is a sorcerer!  You trusted your horde to a sorcerer?!""  ""He's a very trustworthy sorcerer, most times.  It's true, sometimes he gets a little power-hungry and over-extends his reach and causes chaos and shakes civilization to its core, but as long as I can get my nuts everything is okay, right?""  ""Why does the blind sorcerer agree to help you?""  ""Because the nuts in storage accumulate; we call it 'interest.'  He keeps this for himself.""  ""Nuts do not spawn new nuts.  This is more like mushrooms.""  ""Yes, okay, let's say that it's mushrooms I'm keeping in storage instead of nuts.""  ""Hahahaha, okay my friend, now I understand.

You know what they say about the Queen and her brother? Well, you'll take a shot at that, but fail. Actually, that is sort of a running theme in my visions.  Where was I? Ah, yes! You shall turn your wolf-cloak and once again live as a proud kracken! You shall lead a host of men against the home of your captors! You shall force them to bend the knee and reclaim it for the Iron Islands!  Then, you'll, uh, hmm. Well, you won't murder your two youngest adopted brothers (I mean, wolf-cubs), but you will burn two children alive.  Wow, really? That's pretty messed up. I hope you get what's coming to you.  Now, I see a flayed man! He is your captor, then friend, then worse. He shall beat you, and flay you, then...  Oh, wow. That's even more fucked up than child-murder (relatively speaking). I take back what I said...maybe you DON'T deserve that...  Gods save you, Theon Greyjoy. Yours is the song of humiliation and dick-loss.  Oh, and maybe don't get ""Theon"" embroidered on anything.

You will leave the wolves to be a prince, but in the end you will wish you had never seen the sea. You will be prince, twice, once of iron and once of winter, but both will be fleeting. Nay, they will never call you King. Turncloak, yes, and something worse, but never king. You will lose things you do not know can be lost. You will watch your life slip through your fingers, bloody drop by bloody drop. No, you will not die, but you will wish you had. You will lose yourself. You will learn to hate yourself more than the people who hurt you, and so you will disappear...for a time. And then, you will be a ghost. A ghost you will be, and then a prince again. In the end, you will be left with only yourself and count yourself blessed. You will be alone, forgotten, and bards will never sing songs of you. But you do not always have to be lost. That will be your choice. Your blood is bitter, Theon Greyjoy, with steel and tears and hate, and I wish I had not tasted it. Oh, laugh at me. Tell yourself I am mad with age and blood is just blood. Tell yourself you do not believe in fortune tellers. I do not need you to believe in me. The road before you is a  dark one and in the end you will not even believe in yourself."

He strides to the seat next to me and collapses into it as though he feels entitled to use my belongings without invitation.  He tosses a silver coin onto my table with a gesture that tells me that he desperately wants to look as though the money means nothing to him.  ""Old man!  Tell me my future.""  ""Very well, very well.""  I stand, and walk to my shelf of trinkets.  None of them perform any genuine magic, however the theatrics are important.  I lift a crystal ball down from the top, and set it on the table between my seat and his.  I pull the dust cloth from it.  He glances at it, and glances again.  He's eager to see for himself, but doesn't want to look it.  I seat myself, and place my hands on the Crystal ball and close my eyes.  The visions begin.  My eyes snap open.  In my mind, the future flows like a stream of water that I wade through; I can see its path though I cannot change its course.  My eyes see only my reflection in the glassy surface of the crystal ball.  And my eyes go wide.  Wider.  It seems my eyes must roll from their sockets and onto the table in front of me before I finally pull my hands from the Crystal ball.  He learns forward.

explainlikeIAmA,35eiax,flyslaughter,38,Sat May 9 15:50:53 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I brought some coffee because this is going to be a long meeting. Please, help yourselves. Agent Jackson called me in from Hogan's Alley retraining to give this not-so-brief briefing and I hope you all accept my apologies for any discomfort in your routines or lives you had to make to be here.  Our perp this week is the French serial killer, The Chameleon or Le Caméléon as he is known to his compatriots. Until recently he operated in the Asiatic and African states as well as Southern Europe. Our liaison officer from the CIA will detail the information collected on him during the various failed assassination attempts afterwards.  I'm sure you are all wondering why I am briefing you about someone who is technically outside of our jurisdiction. It is because it seems that The Chameleon has begun operating within our borders. He was recently spotted in Hawai'i. Reports are also coming in that he may be harbored in homes of sleeper cell agents in California and Florida where he is kept safe from the hostile local forces.   Known for his ability to blend in to local surroundings, he has often been described as a master thief, manipulator, and disguise artist. It has been said that most of the images captured of him were either planted by the Chameleon himself or created by a third party to sell to the agencies for a profit. Whether these reports are true is as yet unconfirmed but bear in mind that no photographs exist of him actually committing a crime.   His work is meticulous and painstaking. Often he will spend months crafting and building an extensive backstory and persona for himself to fit into an environment so that he can then move in on a new target without fear of being compromised. No one has ever come close to noticing who this killer is and intervening before it was too late. No one has even caught on he was in the country or who his target was until it was too late.  His actions have already spawned a copycat killer here in the States, code named Carolina Anole. The main distinction between her and Chameleon is that while Carolina induces the person to commit suicide, no trace of poison has ever been found and no signs of violence that were not self-inflicted were ever found. She seems to simply be a run of the mill serial killer who so far has gotten off for lack of direct proof and a good attorney, I think we can dismiss her for now as a major concern.  As I mentioned earlier, no agency has ever had such an exclusive and advantageous opportunity as we have been given here, that of getting one step ahead of this terroristic threat before he manages to land a blow...until now.  Agent Jackson from CIA has made it his life's mission to track down and examine the evidence and data of the Chameleon and has successfully tracked the Chameleon to our fair country. Sadly, there's something that he did not become aware of until it was too late.  You see, ladies and gentlemen (now, now,  pay attention), the target this time isn't a politician or a rich billionaire, it was he himself. You see, he's been getting a bit too close for the Chameleon's comfort and, well, what's the point anymore. You all should feel the poison taking effect by now.   Henry, I'd like to let your last minutes be peaceful, stop trying to grab that gun, you'll only hurt yourself. Your motor functions should be almost gone by now though your hearing should not be impaired just yet. Since you can't blink, I'm guessing your eyes are feeling pretty dry and your vision's a blurry, but I hope you remember that face of mine as I gave you my presentation. A presentation about myself, it's like I'm back in school in Sierra Leone. Ah, well, rest well my noble opponent. You have earned your state funeral."

Okay, I'll let it slide, it doesn't really break anything.  I won't check your power feats, I know you won't do anything crazy, so roll your stats...  holy shit.  Guys, did we decide if we're going to use Palladium's exploding dice rules?  Yeah?

Nice to see you breaking out, not that I minded Scott Free or Selina, but it's nice to see you make a charater that's not a rogue.  Or with a name that begins with 'S'.  Huh - Artificial alignment, but magic feats?  Ah, animated golem, I see.  Well, that's kind of silly.  Looks like you spent all your starting money on enchanted items.  I mean, are you going to just have your whip, your bracers, your tiara, and a swimsuit to tie them together?  ... me and my big mouth.  Steve, a straight up fighter?  Fine by me, we need someone who can just take the front line, and I can see you've got...  even more combat feats.  Serum alignment, and - is this right - the Leadership feat, but no skill ranks?  Steve, you are allowed to reroll your int when it's that- no?  Okay, suit yourself, you'll have the charisma of a President but horribly outdated on all your skills.  Caitlin, if you tell me you're making a Totemist again I'm out.  A monk?  Okay, we're starting to get beatstick-heavy but I don't mind throwing a few toughies that'll require teamwork at you.  No Wisdom score, but a ... did your Con explode?  Okay, more hitpoints than anyone else and power ranks in...  toughness, strength, and more hit points.  Of course.  Caitlin, you're not playing a monk, you're playing a brick wall that sometimes punches things.  Destined Birth alignment...  finally, one that doesn't require bending the rules to the breaking point, you're fine.  Harley, glad you could make it! A rogue?  Great, we've needed a sneak...  not a sneak?  A flashy stabby trapmaking rogue?  Well, I guess Steve has the dexterity for it, and it's good to see some actual mundane skills in play.  Psychology, odd choice...  wait.  The Induced Upbringing alignment?  Come on, you can't be as brooding as Corrigan this time around.  Think you can play her more..  chipper this time?  We could use somehine happy and social in this group, okay?   Peter, you're going for the Thief-Acrobat this time around.  Thank god SOMEONE has some stealth.

This, in addition to a wide arsenal of weapons, tools, and equipment makes the Vigilante a significant threat even to much larger, more muscle-bound foes.  Hit Points   Hit Dice: 1d8 per vigilante level Hit Points: 8 + Con modifier at first level; 5 + Con modifier per level after 1st   Proficiencies   Armor: Light, and medium armor Weapons: Simple, martial, and exotic weapons Tools: Smith's tools   Equipment You start with the following items and equipment, in addition to that granted by your background:   Leather armor Hand crossbow  Crossbow bolts (20) Climber's kit Bag of caltrops Bag of ball bearings Poison vial (1) Metal Boomarang (20) 90,000 gold pieces   Class Feature: Solo Specialist You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature who does not have one of your allies adjacent to it. Also, during a surprise round, if you are the first to act and your target is unaware of your presence, you get advantage on your attack roll, and any hit is considered a critical hit (as if a coup de gras).  Class Feature: Combat Study You gain proficiency in all weapons, including exotic weapons, improvised weapons, and unarmed combat. You are also considered to have proficiency on any knowledge check related to weapons or armor (for example to identify the origin, make, and typical users of a particular weapon), and you may add double your proficiency bonus for these checks.    Scion Though born among mortals, you are not like most folks. Even at a young age, you learned very quickly that your physical capabilities far surpassed those of even trained adults. No one is sure what is the source of your tremendous strength and resilience, but it is up to decide how to use them.  Hit Points   Hit Dice: 1d12 per scion level Hit Points: 12 + Con modifier at first level; 7 + Con modifier per level after 1st   Proficiencies   Armor: None Weapons: None Tools: None   Equipment You start with the following items and equipment, in addition to that granted by your background:   Disguise   Class Feature: Otherworldly Origin This feature increases all of your ability scores to 30. Additionally, you gain a +20 Class Feature bonus to AC, walk and fly speeds of 60', and your jump height and distance are both multiplied by 10, and you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. You also gain proficiency in unarmed strikes which deal 2d12 damage, and you may cast the following spell at will, using the highest of your Int, Wis, or Cha scores as the spellcasting ability:  Eye Rays Casting Time: 1 Action | Range: within sight | Components: None | Duration: Instantaneous You project two beams of light from your eyes which both hit a target creature that you can see. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw for which they have disadvantage if not behind cover, or take 8d10 fire damage, half as much on a success.  However, there is a mysterious green mineral that when brought within 60' of you, even a small quantity will negate all benefits of this racial feature, as well as reducing all of your ability scores to 6 (-2 modifier), regardless of any other bonuses; this effect lasts for 1d4 rounds after the mineral is moved further than 60' from you.

As such, not only are you proficient in unarmed strikes, which deal 1d6 damage, but you are also granted an incredibly powerful ring that provides you with most of your power. The Emerald Enforcer's Ring is standard issue among all within the Enforcer Corps. Imbued with awesome power, wearing this ring allows to to cast each of the spells below at-will at their base levels, ignoring any component requirements for that spell (You are still limited to your regular complement of actions each round, as well as the normal rules for Concentration.
