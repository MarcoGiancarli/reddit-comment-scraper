Android,3dxm3k,sylocheed,3,Mon Jul 20 14:38:36 2015 UTC,I just looked at Wiki and it says max throughput for BT LE is just .27 Mbits/s which is probably not enough for high quality audio.
Android,3dxm3k,Isogen_,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"It's certainly enough. That's 270kbps, VoLTE has a bit rate of ~24kbps."
Android,3dxm3k,CommanderBob22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:22 2015 UTC,That's max throughput. Average is probably quite a bit less.
Android,3dxm3k,TheSlimyDog,0,Mon Jul 20 19:53:50 2015 UTC,In a qa for the original they claimed there were no benefits of switching to it for this use case.
Android,3dxm3k,Mavendreas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"There isn't. Not for a headset, only for wearables that send small amounts of data at a certain frequency. A headset though sends a 'lot' of data in longer sessions.  That's just what I've been told by the guys at JayBird though, not a BT expert myself."
Android,3dxm3k,JustCallMeBen,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:17 2015 UTC,"It would probably help if you want to use it for the smart lock stuff, but yeah, the current generation of BTLE doesn't really help for audio."
Android,3dxm3k,Charwinger21,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:31 2015 UTC,can you put two together and have stereo audio for music?
Android,3dxm3k,datdarnkahlfin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:29 2015 UTC,Not without much effort from your side. You would need to adjust bluetooth to connect both of them at the same time and then split the stereo audio stream to each device by software. I don't think a hack for this exists yet.
Android,3dxm3k,HashWorks,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"that would be an awesome built in feature someday  kind of like how logitech does with their UE boom speakers, they have a ""double up' option that links two together and created stereo sound"
Android,3dxm3k,datdarnkahlfin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"Sony has a set of bluetooth speakers that can do this.  If one is paired it plays both channels, pair two and it splits them."

Android,3dxm3k,JustCallMeBen,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:35 2015 UTC,Which is perfect for biking. You can listen to you tunes and stay aware of your surroundings!
Android,3dxm3k,wallflyers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:22 2015 UTC,using only one ear is super annoying.  Just use earbuds that do not completely shut out all traffic noise.

Android,3dxm3k,Baalinooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:36 2015 UTC,Not if it doesn't already. You would have to tap the ear to activate it
Android,3dxm3k,Ariakkas10,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:18 2015 UTC,But it does already work. So it would work with the Hint?
Android,3dxm3k,Baalinooo,7,Mon Jul 20 16:44:04 2015 UTC,Yep. I thought you meant the voice wake up feature.
Android,3dxm3k,Ariakkas10,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:52 2015 UTC,I do. The Nexus 6 is a Motorola phone and has always-listening. I'm wondering if the Hint will have always-listening when paired with the Nexus 6.
Android,3dxm3k,Baalinooo,5,Mon Jul 20 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yes, it will work."
Android,3dxm3k,Ariakkas10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:12 2015 UTC,The original didn't because the Moto Voice app it needs to function with always listening isn't available on Nexus 6. If the new Moto Hint also needs Moto Voice then you'll have the same problem.
Android,3dxm3k,dark79,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:34 2015 UTC,I see. That's too bad.

The Hint works specifically with the Motorola application.  Unless you shoehorned Moto Voice onto the N6, it probably won't work like you want it to."

Android,3dxm3k,sleepinlight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:36 2015 UTC,Any Android phone can have Google Now voice commands. But only Motorola phones have the always-listening capability when the screen's off. And I have no idea whether other Bluetooth headsets can do this.
Android,3dxm3k,ailee43,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:40 2015 UTC,"i thought that this headset had the always listening built in, so you didnt need it on the phone."
Android,3dxm3k,Ariakkas10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:30 2015 UTC,You have to tap the outside ear part to turn your phone on. The earbud doesn't cause your phone to be always listening if the phone does that already do it

Android,3dy5ct,OssotSromo,37,Mon Jul 20 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"Spotify Radio has been terrible in my experience. ""oh you picked a band to base this radio station off? Great, now I will play songs only from that band"""

I love it to death, but I've had better radio experiences with just about everything else. It's not enough to justify switching services, especially since Spotify ticks all my other boxes, but it's just a constant annoyance knowing that radio will suck.  I know it's pie in the sky, but I wish a company like Pandora, which has mastered radio, would license it's algorithm to services like Spotify so they we'd have radio ""powered by Pandora""."

Android,3dy5ct,throwinken,3,Mon Jul 20 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think it can really depend on what you use as a seed. For more esoteric artists, Spotify (and pandora, and probably everything else) is simply unable to draw a line to something else in the same vein, that isn't another song by that artist.  It's too easy to get stuck in the rabbit hole of ""I'm going going to play songs from these half dozen artists"".  Side bar: One thing I think Spotify hasn't fixed it is when it switched from starred tracks to checked tracks, you lost the ability to play a radio station based on your starred tracks. Albeit, the radio was so shitty that it basically just played my starred tracks but the idea of playing radio based on my favorite tracks is inherently a good one. I don't understand why Spotify hasn't added a radio button to your checked songs."
Android,3dy5ct,opus1one1,13,Mon Jul 20 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"Really? Spotify's radio blows Pandora's out the water imo. Maybe it's the type of music to or how picky I am about the music I listen to, but Pandora has always given me horrible stations."
