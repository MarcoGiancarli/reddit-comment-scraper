youtube,3e4980,AnonymousCommentator,2,Tue Jul 21 22:41:56 2015 UTC,"Something similar to this post is posted here over and over and over, usually at least once a week or so.  And every once in while, someone in the know from YouTube will post that the button does, in fact do something -- it sends info to YouTube which is used by the comment system.  It just doesn't decrement the count of likes that is displayed.  The count of likes is a count of likes.  It is not a sum of likes minus dislikes as in Reddit.  You can of course complain to YouTube that you don't like this approach (pun intended) and you certainly won't be the first to complain, as this approach seems to be greatly disliked (pun intended again).  I sometimes think this subreddit needs a big banner at the top that says ""Yes, we all know that the dislike button on comments doesn't decrement the displayed like count, but YT claims it does indeed do something""."

There is a help forum. True, it's unusual to get a direct response from a Google employee, but that's because they're busy actually working. Instead, users offer what help they can and anything that can't be answered by users or Top Contributors can be escalated by Top Contributors to staff. We actually have, behind the scenes, a special category for ""borked videos"", just so you know.  But it's not easy, and do you know why? It's because the forums are constantly being spammed by people asking ""How do I [insert stupidly trivial task here]?"" or ""My foot fetish video was taken down WHAT DID I DO WRONG?"" or ""I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO AN EMPLOYEE!!!!!!!11111one"" Occasionally we get ""I'm going to sue!"" or ""I hate Google+!"" or even -- and I swear I'm not making this up -- ""Chad, Jawed and Steve owe me money because YouTube was my idea and they stole it.""  It takes TCs long enough to wade through all that dross just to make sure that employees don't have to waste their time with it. How much time do you think they have?  Oh, and woe betide any Google employee who does respond in public to a public post, because then they get ambushed by everyone else: ""I know this is off topic, but can you e-mail me my password, sue my friend for defamation because she called me a jerk, tell Prince to stop claiming copyright on his own songs so I can upload them, tell me where to find that video of a sneezing panda, ban let's plays?""  Oh, and let's not forget the way people post questions without first searching the forum, so the few ""This video won't process"" threads we do get are buried under a pile of ""I HATE GRID VIEW!"" threads.  But hey -- that's okay. You can, if you want, make believe that the guy who actually got the video fixed can't possibly be an employee, oh no, because that would shatter your preconceptions and we can't have that.

youtube,3e1bdn,uselessrng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:33 2015 UTC,CDS. Our roll up has people paid after the first month of being in-network. YouTube pays the month beforehand.
youtube,3e1bdn,AnimalHeroFirstClass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"I've been in this network for like 5 months, I got support to finally answer me back after a couple of days and 3 weeks of no payment, apparently there's this disney payment system that I wasn't set up in and the support guy said he requested for me to get set up in it. I'm gonna have to wait 3 more weeks then check to see if i'm in. Just more stupid stuff, that should have been taken care of awhile ago"

youtube,3dy6cd,JoshFaceh,3,Mon Jul 20 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear of your unfortunate missed opportunity. If it makes you feel any better, you can always say you were up there, like a YouTube founder. Uploading back in 2006? There was only a handful of people who actually realized what YouTube was in terms of content creation at the time. I would feel amazed at just having uploaded back then before YouTube became another money-sucking Google entity. I watched your Stanley Parable video too and I loved it! But hold your head high. You can say that you uploaded videos that had the potential to go viral in 2006. 2006!!! Nobody can go back in time, so that means you are part of a select group of people.  Look at me, I can't even find any other YouTubers to try and collab with. I have a very small scale gaming channel. All the active channels never answer me back or are not interested and all the channels that do answer back have like 5 videos uploaded over the course of a year. I have uploaded 117 videos. Next month, it will be 2 years that I am doing this and still no satisfiable success. I don't even know where to go next. A few days ago, I got so bored and made some new channel art. I think I put more effort into that in Photoshop than I put in to most videos. It's just so de-motivating. I think I put up average quality content, but I just need to find a new niche and people to work with. I was thinking of switching from games to sports and sports games only. I am passionate about NHL and MLB the Show as well as almost all sports in real life. One thing I would love to do is start a channel like SoldierKnowsBest but instead of electronics, I unbox and give the inside scoop on bobbleheads. However, that would be very expensive to deal with so many collectibles of that value, and my job at a pizza joint does not pay enough to star deducting from savings.  I look at my channel every day and see maybe 4 views at most on my most recent videos. And the videos that get more views get so much hate and idk why. I don't want the fame and I don't care about the fame. I just want a channel where people show appreciation. But I feel that the problem is that so many viewers, especially those with accounts do not distribute their appreciation over 5-6 channels. They fanboy maybe 1 or 2 channels and then just sub to the people who work with those channels. And with Google launching all these new programs for people who are already loaded beyond need with viewership, they seem to refuse to even acknowledge the existence of the small scene.  Not to mention, all the other money-based channels that have completely distracted from the real YouTube scene. It seems that every week some new VEVO music channel goes viral and gains half a million subs just because they don't have to deal with copyright like all the rest of us. Then there are the channels like Nigahiga and DudePerfect that actually worked their way up the scale, but barely even upload anymore so people are forced to watch their old content. And of course there are all those channels that just do pranks and all the stuff nobody has the money for.  It's a frustrating situation. I have a single core processor laptop, a capture card, a Rock Band mic, makeshift clothes hanger mic stand, and a sock for a pop filter... I say for 117 videos, I should not feel bad for having that sort of setup yet that amount of output.  I don't even know where to go or what to do. I've wasted the majority of this summer working for minimum wage and by the time my job is over, I'm exhausted. I have about a month left until my senior year of high school starts and I could not be more desperate to do something with my life for once. I haven't even spent a minute of this summer searching for college/university. I was hoping that I could have really have maybe like 500-1k subs by now on my channel to at least have an audience. But instead, I have 65 inactive subscribers and 1 active subscriber. I really do not want to spend any more time working in these dehabilitating environments or working to fulfill someone else's dream while feeling so deprived and fatigued. With my parents' money problems, college is one of the last things I may want to think about at this point and I was hoping YouTube could provide just a small amount of income for someone like myself. I do not ever make content with the intent of earning money. I strongly recognize the fact that only a handful of people even have the chance to have a channel that can earn a steady income for a family or an individual. Every time though I watch the video from TmarTn where he shows off his Nissan GTR as hard work or when CaptainSparklez demos his Bentley or his new LA Penthouse, I just think ""Damn, I'd kill to be in that position."" And it has nothing to do with money. Heck, if I was earning that income, I'd be living in the smallest living arrangement necessary with a low budget because I would be too busy making videos to worry about material things. I never have had many close friends and I steered myself away from the athletic scene in high school after some bad run-ins with a former group of friends and I never wanted anything like that to happen again, but at the same time, I love sports and following them at the professional level. I never had something to call mine that I worked for.  I don't know what it is. I think I have the motivation, just not enough. It's been almost 2 years like I said and I have seen channels with 2k subs that are only one year old right now. And here I am again putting another 15 minutes into a Reddit post.  Hold your head high, I'll try to do the same.  Btw, my channel is http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePaulitician"

youtube,3ds80w,RockefSteady,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:32 2015 UTC,"Destiny,  Unfortunately, the AdSense guidelines sort of prevent people from talking about the specifics here. The numbers above are a personal measurement based on a specific experience with a specific viral video.  Ways this differs from the norm:   Viral videos generally have a broad appeal, and as such, have higher than usual CPMs. Viral videos -- or at least mine -- are often embedded rather than on YT.com, and embedded videos often have lower clickthrough rates/preroll rates. The average monetized playbacks can have a huge impact. The numbers above were based on my personal monetization rate -- which was about 50%. (So on a day with 153,000 views, I got 83,000 monetized playbacks.) This can be drastically altered by your audience, especially if you're playing into a heavily AdBlock enabled crowd. Numbers were in October, which is a generally higher time for CPMs (heading into Christmas season).   So, as everyone else is saying: there's a lot of factors. (And of course, this doesn't count the Content ID factor: I lost more than $1000 in ad revenue to two bogus Content ID claims, over a one week period, for example.) But the numbers I gave are a pretty common ballpark that I've seen is pretty generally agreed upon."

youtube,3ds80w,IAmCacao,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:38 2015 UTC,"It's pretty subjective. It's different case by case depending on a few different factors such as CPM, views vs monetized views etc."
youtube,3ds80w,JustJaaayy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"I suspect it varies all over the place, depending upon a number of factors including what type of ads are enabled and what sort of ads end up being associated with the video, whether you allow the video on non-monetized platforms, and even whether it is the type of video that would tend to be watched by people likely to use adblock or not.  Probably hundreds of factors contribute.  Having relatively small, niche channels, I have no single video that reached that level, but I have two examples from which I can extrapolate:  Video #1 is 5 minutes long and has overlay ads only.  It has gotten 250K views and has earned me $75 so far.  From that you can estimate that 1M views would be about $300.  Video #2 is 25 minutes long and has pre-roll ads only.  It has gotten 250K views and has earned me $300 so far.  From that you can estimate that 1M views would be about $1200.  The above numbers are rounded and not exact.  In my case there is no network involved.  Both videos I allow to be played anywhere, including non-monetized platforms.  Neither video has anything to do with gaming.  The conclusion:  Don't expect to quit your current job just because you manage to get one video with 1M views (unless your living expenses are quite low)."

youtube,3ds80w,ativerse,0,Sun Jul 19 05:13:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on CPM , I get $6 CPM so if its $6 per 1000 views then roughly $6000 ..... so basically every person that gets 1M views probably gets a different amount of money due to their CPM rates."
youtube,3ds80w,Axitfire,2,Sun Jul 19 03:41:05 2015 UTC,Google takes a generous share of the CPM though (can't recall the split something like 70/30) because what they charge advertisers doesn't all go into the channel owners pocket.
youtube,3ds80w,stevestgermain,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:55 2015 UTC,"The split is 55/45 (in favor of the creator). The biggest thing that people tend to ignore is that CPMs are only on monetized views. Monetized views are ""views where YouTube showed an ad"" -- which varies wildly depending on the content. For some people -- like gamers, whose entire audience uses AdBlock -- you'll have almost 0 monetized views. For a viral video (like my example below), I had a monetized rate of about 40%. Someone else in the thread gave 15% as an example. This is the real number that's all over the place: CPMs vary, but the biggest metric no one ever seems to talk about is their monetized view rate.  (I had no idea this was even a thing until I had a video that made me some money -- and even once I figured it out, I had a hard time finding anyone talking about it. Everyone in the industry talks about CPMs, but no one talks about monetization rate.)"
youtube,3ds80w,crschmidt,2,Sun Jul 19 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, I spot-checked some of my videos and found the monetized rate varied from as low as 10% to as high as 45%, depending on the video.  I only checked a handful of videos, though.  It would be nice if YouTube made this statistic more readily available.  I had to compute it manually by looking at the number of views and number of monetized playbacks and doing the math.  It would be nice if YouTube just showed this number somewhere, and let you sort the list of videos by it.  Video Manager doesn't let you sort videos by some things that would be interesting, such as total earnings or % monetized playbacks.  For example, just for fun, I'd like to see a list of my videos sorted by the ones earning the most money, in absolute terms, or in per-view terms.  Edit:  Actually, I see in Analytics I can see videos ranked by total earnings.  But I couldn't find a way to rank by % monetized playbacks or ""earnings per total number of views"" or anything along those lines, to see which videos tend to do the best or worst at % monetized views."

There are different types of ad on YouTube; pre-rolls (skippable and non-skippable) and those overlay ads that pop up at the bottom of the video player a few seconds in. If you refresh the video, you may get an overlay instead of a pre-roll. It seems, though, as if by doing this you're triggering some glitch.

youtube,3dsrql,mutantmike,2,Sun Jul 19 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"well I joined a MCN so I could gain copyright protection and instant monetization on my videos. Now YouTube makes you wait until they verify your monetization , thus making you lose earnings , also you are doing Pokemon videos so you can greatly benefit from a MCNs copyright protection. Since you have 115K subscribers you can easily get into a managed partnership , which actually give you the instant monetization and copyright protection unlike affiliate partnerships. I am not sure about the ads but most networks claim to offer better ads , thus more revenue.  In my network MGN (Freedom!) they offer music libraries in sites such as Audiomicro.com which well, I like their music library but if you think your music is better then don't bother about it , however if your music is copyrighted then I recommend that you don't use it and yes you can still use your music if it is not copyrighted. Some networks give good support some networks give awful support , not much I can say on that since I only joined 2 networks ever. Since you got 115k subscribers I doubt a network would help you grow since as much as I know all they do is give you access to forums in which you can talk with other people and collaborate or they can feature you on their main channel but I still don't think that it would help you significantly."

I don't understand why they act like they do anything useful in this regard, but the ads are all provided by YouTube. They may provide a higher CPM for some users -- but the reason isn't because they give you different ads, it's because as part of an MCN you get access to some of their functionality, specifically ads like unskippable ads or mid-roll/post-roll ads, which may generate more revenue.  It's possible I'm missing something, but I've had this conversation with a few other YouTubers, and the end result is always the same: none of us know why MCNs claim you get higher CPMs with them.  I've seen no evidence that for an established creator -- which it sounds like you are -- with access to YouTube partner support -- which I think you'd have, given your view count -- is going to get anything out of an MCN, based on what I know of them.

Well, in Brazil, most people speak Portuguese, while in the UK, people generally speak English.

And yes, if you have pictures you ""found on the web"", you must be able to prove conclusively that the original owners of those images consent to your using them commercially, unless you can make an extremely good case for fair use (which is much harder than most people think); if you can't, it's not legal for you to use those images in your video, let alone actually monetize it."
youtube,3dps5s,rewboss,2,Sat Jul 18 10:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's actually probably different than that: It's probably random chance.  Basically, when a video comes in, YouTube will apply some rules   If it meets x criteria (""Topic is 'BUY BUY BUY MY SPAM VIAGRA'"", etc.) then it's not available for monetization.  If it is from a new creator, and we don't know anything about them, ask them to assert that they have all commercial rights, and we will review them at some point to see if they can monetize. Once a creator has a history of decent uploads where they have rights to monetize, monetization is allowed automatically.   So there's probably a filter in there -- either you're a new creator, monetizing for the first time, and Google has no history on you, so you just have to go through a manual review process the first time, and sometimes at random times after that.  You should just be able to say ""I have rights to use this content"" or something like that, assuming you're not using any content which would prevent monetization. (I won't make a judgement call on the fair use of your specific photos from the web, but what's getting in the way is not Content ID matching against photos.)"

All other content is my own original work.   That's seriously all you need to do. Whatever is your own original work, you state that it is your own original work.

Just in case, though, I take precautions:   I archive all my unedited footage (I have an external hard drive for this). This way I can prove that all video and audio I recorded is genuinely mine, because I am the only person on earth who has the originals, with all the outtakes and everything.

youtube,3dmmnd,minimaxir,6,Fri Jul 17 14:34:22 2015 UTC,"Very interesting data. I wonder if the drop in mid-2015 is related to the realization that longer videos != more views.   With the amount of content being created on YouTube, producers are trying to find new ways to attract people to their content. One of the ways people found were reducing the total length of their videos. The shorter the video, the less time the viewer has to invest in watching it, the more likely they are to watch it. That's the thought at least.  With the new way YouTube algorithm works, I wonder if we'll start seeing that trend up again? Basically, retention is now one of the most important factors when YouTube ""rates"" a channel. The retention rate is focused more on how many minutes watched, and the percentage of the video watched isn't as important. For example, a 3 minute video with a 100% retention isn't as good as a 10 minute video with a 50% retention (I'm over simplifying it).  I read a good article a few months ago that was talking about YouTube is becoming a bit more hostile to animators since long duration videos end up with higher search rankings, and better CPMs. Basically, it was making the argument that people who produce shorter 3-5 minute content are finding it harder and harder to make any money on YouTube. Interesting read, but I can't find the original article."

What I'm referring to here is the amount of time people spend actually watching the video. Longer videos typically get between 25 and 50% viewership while shorter videos see better engagement. The reason? It's easier to watch a shorter video than a longer one. Considering Youtube is pushing creators to focus more on this kind of engagement, it's interesting that we've seen such a steady rise regardless."

youtube,3do9nt,dabbling,3,Fri Jul 17 22:04:19 2015 UTC,I monetized my videos since day 1 about 1.5 years ago and just finally made $100. 130k views later and about 900 subs. I run a gaming channel.
youtube,3do9nt,TheManCaveYTChannel,2,Fri Jul 17 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"I would say to not monetize. I am in the same boat as you with my new channel. My old channel: 30LargeCinema has over 5.2k subscribers and my views per month has dropped rapidly so after using that channel for a few years I decided I needed a new channel entirely. What I would do is set some limits and goals for yourself. I right now am in the process of unmonetizing all my videos because Youtube was AIDS and remonetized them without my permission. Anyway, the reason I am doing this is because I still have not set up my Paypal account with my partnership network Freedom! so any increments of a dollar I would have made at this point would go to waste anyway because the network has no address or destination to send the money too. In a case like yours however I still would not monetize until you have a solid fanbase, and I am talking 500+ viewers per video on average. The reason being is because if I were to search for covers of songs I would want to hear it right away, but if I get slapped by a 30 second nonskippable advertisement on your channel and I see that you have only 100 subscriber and the video has only 150 views.. I would most likely click off right away.  But if I saw you had 100 subscribers, 150 views on the video and no ads, I would totally watch the video if it was what I was looking for. Display ads are fine because they block minimal portions of the screen and especially on a cover video, the visual portion is not as important as the audio. As a summary (Sorry for th long response, I can talk about ads and monetization forever...) if you are going to monetize your videos now, only use display ads or a post-roll/post video advertisement (NO pre-roll or even worse, NON-SKIPPABLE pre-roll ads) . Otherwise, do not monetize your content until you have a solid and supportive viewer base. You will be surprised on how much faster your channel will grow when people arent pestered by advertisements before they watch your content, and then once the fish are plenty, reel em in bud ;)  Hope this helped!!"

If you join a network, maybe that's different, but by default, unskippable ads are only provided to established partners with a history of significant viewership; I'm not even sure 1000 views/day would cut it."

Freedom! is more catered towards people starting out and although you can probably find better CPM on other networks, this is the best and quickest option for you if you strictly want partner benefits. Thats basically my reason for joining the network, I am just waiting until I grow even more to leave, because I have not monetized any of my content yet and I am hoping that will give me an advantage over someone else.  I am also not a recruiter so please take my advice into cosideration.  If you do not want to join Freedom! Network then you can brosw around for other networks that have no lock in contracts..

youtube,3dkqmw,KSKaleido,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:28:09 2015 UTC,"KSK,   I don't understand why giving people an option is so hard.   If you're not a software developer with a long history of writing complex applications, I think that it's very difficult to know why this is so hard. If you are an experienced software developer, I'm surprised you would find this hard to understand :)  Software is hard. Options are a great way to make sure that you are forever stuck with two different ways to do something -- which may have drastically different chunks of code supporting them -- and maintaining two parallel chunks of code is a pretty surefire way to make sure one of them is going to break, and you're not going to notice.  But I think that it's clear in this case there's clearly people who like both. So although I don't think it's easy -- I think it will be significantly more costly, short-term and long-term -- I do think that it's worth doing both anyway, and I've already passed that on to the team in question.  There was initially a lot of feedback when the sub feed changed away from the grid layout; it's possible that devs thought that changing it back would be universally liked, since we never got any positive feedback on what we have now. :p   How come there still isn't a word on a better way to organize subs like was promised after getting rid of collections?   There wasn't a promise there. (You may have read it that way; the people who wrote the message didn't intend it that way.) What you're seeing here -- the grid layout -- is absolutely part of ""Continue working on subscriptions"". You may hate it -- it's clear some users do, though some also like it -- but this is exactly the sort of thing that you could expect from the message that was posted about collections.   Why are people still not seeing certain videos from content creators on their sub page?   If you, or anyone you know, has it happen that videos are not showing up in https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions for channels you're subscribed to, let me know. The last time I asked, I was told this was not intentional, and if it happened, it was a bug. So far, every time I've asked a user about this, they never get back to me. If it's a reproducible failure, I want to see it, so I can tell you why.  In short: This is what devs are working on with subscriptions (or at least, it's probably part of it. It's the same team). If there are actual bugs, I haven't been able to reproduce them and bring them to the team. (I hear the complaint all the time, so I believe it exists, but I can't just file a bug that says ""users complain about $x""; I'd be filing hundreds of unactionable bugs per day.) So the team is working on what it thinks will be a benefit for at least some users: a different subscription display layout."

If it's a reproducible failure, I want to see it, so I can tell you why.   Well, here's the problem. Every time I've had the issue, I either didn't notice for weeks (until checking the channel itself and being like 'wtf is this video I've never seen') at which point it's long gone from the sub page anyway, so I can't point and say ""Look, it's gone!""  There's also a separate issue where a content creator will tweet out a video they made, and sometimes I won't see it on my sub page until a full day later. I can watch the video fine from the link but I don't see it on Youtube for a long time. I haven't seen that particular problem in a few months, though, so maybe that's fixed?  Anyway, for the record, I've done a fair bit of software development myself, but never for a website as complex as Youtube. I mostly make games, so my experience says you should never tie your UI heavily into the actual functionality of your software. Giving people options is trivial for a game UI, but it's possible I underestimated the complexity of Youtube's layout. There's literally no way for me to know that without actually looking at the codebase haha.  Finally:   There wasn't a promise there. (You may have read it that way; the people who wrote the message didn't intend it that way.)    I remember literally watching a video with an interview from a developer at Youtube right around the time they were talking about removing collections, saying all these things about how they would be rolling out better features for organizing subs. I guess that's not technically a promise but it's pretty fucked up that months later there still isn't any sort of replacement for collections or any reasonable way to organize your sub list...

It is very good that you guys might consider doing this because it will return valuable info; You will finally be able to understand how many of YouTube users prefer one layout to the other based on their layout choice. This way you will be able to work on just one or the other (if lots of users prefer mostly one of the two) or work on a new one to try, different from both (if one of the layouts is being chosen as much as the other)."

Also the removal of watched videos from the subscription list is a nice new feature, as long as the users are warned about it and are able to turn it off.

youtube,3dki6j,Bocephis,4,Fri Jul 17 00:26:29 2015 UTC,"This is tricky to do, because you must be at least 13 to own a Google account.  Therefore, you'll need to create the channel yourself, and work with him to run it, since he can't directly control the account.  The way I would do it is:   From your account, visit the new channel page. At the bottom of the dialog, click ""To use a business or other name, click here."" and follow the instructions.  This creates a channel linked to a Google+ page, rather than the main account. If you like, you can add other Google accounts as managers.  This will allow them to sign in as the channel as well.  (Useful if you have a husband/wife/family member/pet alien who should also be able to help your son with the account.) Work with your son to create content, upload it, and otherwise manage the channel.  Remember that you will be signed in with your own account, so you should not allow him to use it by himself.  You can let him make the decisions as much as you're comfortable with, but you have the final say. When your son turns 13, he can create his own Google account.  If you think he's ready to run the channel by himself, you can add him as a manager (as before) or even transfer the page to him entirely.  If any of the videos are monetized, you'll need to continue to manage that end of it yourself, since the minimum age on AdSense is 18."

Often filenames of webvideos have no meaning and trying to find the title of the video on the website is not reliable enough. Even if you would just trying to target a specific website, it is hard to automate.   What you could do is simply recording your computer screen/browser window the entire time with a program like ""OBS"" (open broadcaster). You could also just capture the audio with something like ""Audacity"" and use the ""Stereo Mix"" channel of your soundcard as ""Recording Device"".   I think another option might using ""VLC"" with a web plugin. I never personally tried it, but it has a feature to play web-streams inside their desktop window. VLC is generally very versatile and maybe you could just ask it to save upon playback, but that wouldn't be fully automatic.  Google for the keywords i have put in quotation marks and you should find helpful tutorials to set it up with your system. I think OBS is the best option if you just want a simple continous DVR.

I think the intent was to see if the benefit of providing an option was sufficiently low that the team could avoid the cost (of having the extra code, more options to test, etc.)  However, I've passed on the feedback that we've got a pretty clearly divided userbase on this front, and we probably need to provide an option here. I don't know if that is the decision that will be made, but at least I passed on the message."

youtube,3div90,GoredonTheDestroyer,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"After looking through documentation for a while, my personal opinion is that this wouldn't violate any of our policies.  The strictest policy I was able to find was the one covering AdSense ads on websites:   Ads are also not permitted on pages which sell or promote the sales of beer, hard alcohol, or liqueurs. [...] However, publishers are permitted to place ads on informational content relating to brewing or distilling beer   https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348688?hl=en#Drug_alcohol_and_tobacco-related_content  Even under that policy, an informational show on breweries wouldn't be an issue.  Fair warning: I'm not actually a policy person, so I can't give you an ""official ruling"" or anything like that.  But I can't find a reason that we would disable ads on your videos, much less disable the channel entirely.  So I'd say you're pretty unlikely to have any issues."

youtube,3dkvce,ITheBeastI,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"I created a gaming YouTube channel about a week ago.   What exactly were you expecting to happen? Instant success is extremely rare, and only happens to those who are both extremely talented and extremely lucky.  I watched the first minute of your Cat Mario Rage Level 2 video. I'm not a gamer, so perhaps it's just me, but there was nothing particularly compelling about it (aside from the very bad audio). This is going to be harsh, but your commentary was neither informative nor entertaining: ""Is this the right tube? I hope it is. What the hell? Holy shit."" What does that actually add to the video? What vital thing would I be missing if I just turned my speakers off? If all you're doing is saying what I would be thinking if I was the one playing the game, you might just as well not say anything.  Look at what the successful gaming channels are doing. I don't mean try to be like them, I mean take note of how they add entertainment value.  The problem is that the gaming video market is pretty much saturated: anyone with a gaming PC, a screen recorder and a headset can make a Let's Play. If you want to have even a chance at success, you need to come with a different angle.  Here's an example of a different angle, which you now can't do because it's already been done. If you turned your speakers off, what would you miss? Answer: All the jokes. And notice that the video is only 6 minutes long: it keeps cutting to the ""players"" to hide the fact that they've edited out huge long chunks where nothing interesting or exciting happens."
youtube,3djc5e,doublekbang,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:03:50 2015 UTC,One of the greatest lessons you will learn in your life is nobody will help you achieve success apart from you. My advice to you is to simply just take action by yourself instead of waiting for others to pitch in their thoughts. Feel what you think is right and take action on that. But the most important thing is to simply take action!

What I suggest is you search for your particular niche to understand how they come up with their title and their thumbnail as its particularly important when your looking to get more views.   As you can see most of the videos contain (Piano Cover) in the title. I'd suggest you put that as well also take a video still and sharpen the image in photoshop and upload that as your custom thumbnail so it stands out more.   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=piano+cover"
youtube,3diqeb,nightmiles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:26:34 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much everything about annotations is utterly terrible... worst part of the YouTube content creation experience by far right now.

youtube,3diqeb,sliced_lime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"Cards are nice and all, but that's another strike against putting effort into end-of-video viewer engagement. Are end slates not as important as I thought?"

youtube,3diqeb,FunnyMan3595,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"Cards are indeed expected to replace annotations eventually, but they're not ready to do that yet:   Because cards work across mobile and desktop and give you more flexibility to share what you want, our goal is to have these eventually replace annotations. But this will happen only once they can do everything annotations can do today, and more.   http://youtubecreator.blogspot.com/2015/03/make-your-videos-even-more-interactive.html  I suspect there will be some sort of migration process when that happens, since (as you say) a lot of creators have put a lot of effort into setting up annotations for their videos.  It'd be a shame to waste that.  I filed a feature request for you, but it's up to that team to decide if it makes sense to spend time on it.  From an outside perspective, this seems like it might not be too hard to implement, and it's a nice quality-of-life improvement for the existing system, so they may be interested.  Hard telling for sure, though."
