WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,daveamania,11,Tue Jul 21 16:36:18 2015 UTC,Same notes I made on another post:  not many people are aware that you can get into MK with just your MNSSHP ticket starting at 4pm WITHOUT having to use a standard park admission ticket.  You might consider enjoying the day by the pool and taking it easy then go to the park at 4. It's a good way to save using a regular park day pass.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,monsterbucket,6,Tue Jul 21 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to be a kid at Disney no matter what, but especially at Not So Scary!   I see you are dressing up. It's super fun, and you get to see some really creative costumes.  Trick or Treating: They have stations set up around the park. They give you a treat bag, and you go and collect candy. Sometimes the lines get really long, so maybe don't try to hit all of them. But it's still fun.  The fireworks and parade are awesome. Make sure to get a good spot for the fireworks, ideally around main street or in front of the castle. For the parade, it doesn't really matter, just get at a spot a little early. That's all I'll say!   It will be crowded. Don't stress. Like someone else said, you can get in with just the special event ticket starting at 4. So relax in the day. And since you will be there for several days, don't worry if you don't get to ride a lot the night of the party. Take in the atmosphere, and all the special entertainment they have. You can do any rides you don't get to on the rest of your trip."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,MadeByMonkeys,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:06 2015 UTC,Adults are allowed to wear costume to the party but not mask.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,WaltDisneyWorldMOD,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Did they change this? The last time I read the policy, adults are allowed masks that don't obstruct vision, which is a little ambiguous but not the same as ""no masks."""
WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,Jcpowers3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:27 2015 UTC,https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/faq/parks/recommended-dress/  This is where I got the no mask. And I would assume that they are never allowed because it is listed as a separate point.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,Heartdiseasekills,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't got a citation off hand but I know I've read on an official Disney site that the costume policy differs during MNSSHP.  EDIT - right now on the MNSSHP page it says only this:  Please note: For the safest and best possible Guest experience, please choose costumes that are not obstructive or offensive.  But has in the past said this:  1.) Guests of all ages may wear costumes only to the Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween party event; otherwise, costumes are only permitted at Magic Kingdom park for Guests ages 9 and under. 2.) All costumes must adhere to any guidelines as determined solely by Disney. 3.) Please choose costumes that are not obstructive, offensive or violent. 4.) Guests’ eyes must be visible at all times.  So 2 is kinda ambiguous but they don't specifically say no masks. It's also indicated in a few places that the costume policy for adults is relaxed during this event."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e36jg,Heartdiseasekills,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:47 2015 UTC,The way I would read is super hero mask ok but normal Halloween mask not.

WaltDisneyWorld,3e3ppg,JaquesNoir,4,Tue Jul 21 19:05:10 2015 UTC,All you have to do is tell the person at check in that you don't want to play. Then the sever will not pick on you and of they don't get the message tell them when you are ordering. Or you could eat at the Sci-fi drive in which has the 50-60 feeling without the playful teasing.

If you tell the greeter who seats you, they may not run into your server before they first make it to the table.

WaltDisneyWorld,3e2v85,jamesiscoolbeans,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:05 2015 UTC,"Are these the most commonly done uses? Like for instance, I'll be there on November 1st which is MNSSHP and I want to meet Belle and ride Haunted mansion. Should I get those or go with what's more popular?"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2v85,laur2d2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"I go with what will save you the most TIME, and what can not be had as a 4th, 5th FP option. I personally don't believe in trying to use the 4th and 5th FPs except in certain conditions at MK. I just book the 3 most in demand FPs that save the most time and book them for the busiest part of the day.   First of all, FPs are not used during the Halloween parties. However, you can gain entrance as early as 4pm and book FPs between 4-7, before the party starts. But HM would be a waste of a FP IMO, unless you have no interest in the other 6 attractions I mentioned. And DURING the party, most rides see very short waits anyway. You can practically walk on to most anything. As for meeting Belle, Enchanted Tales with Belle is a decent use of a FP, but you don't actually get to ""meet"" her unless you are a child or one of the two adults involved in the play."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2v85,laur2d2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't plan to go back and book more fastpasses after using my 3. I figured I'd just see where the day takes me. It's bad enough being confined to a strict schedule between the 3 fastpasses and food reservations.   We did plan on entering at 4pm. I knew about that. I did not know you couldn't use Fastpass during the party. So it looks like we have a time crunch. Which really bites because we wanted to try and have dinner around 5 or 6.   Awe, that sucks. I was really hoping you get to meet Belle afterwards. Ugh. I guess I won't bother with it then. I have no kids :(   Thanks for being so helpful, I so appreciate it. It's been 5 years since I was last there."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2v85,laur2d2,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"You can schedule your 3 FPs in a way that will allow you to have dinner when you want. Schedule them for (approximately) 3:10-4:10, 4:10-5:10, and 6:00-7:00. When they let you in at 4, go to your first FP immediately. Then do your second FP immediately. Now you've got between 4:45-6:45 to eat. And then use your last FP before 7. :)  It's very possible you could be one of the adult volunteers for the show. It's also possible you could ask a CM if you could get a picture anyway. It's worth seeing either way. And even if you don't get your picture there, you can always meet her in Epcot."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2v85,Tonycphoto,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I thought the fastpasses were like the restaurants (my computer went crazy there), specific times. I didn't realize you get basically an hour block/window to go in. That makes things SO much easier.   I'll talk to my hubby and see if he's okay with doing that. I feel so silly being an adult and wanting to get a picture with Belle. But I plan to be dressed as Belle for the Halloween party so I thought it'd be neat!   One more question, if you happen to know. I see that you can use fastpasses for fireworks/parades. Is that worth it? I don't really understand how you use a fastpass for Illuminations/Fantasmic/Wishes..."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e2x9j,heathere3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"We were there in 2010, and other than Main Street being kind of a mess, the rest of the park was fine. We had to walk through the Emporium instead of down main street to get into the park, but that was the most it inconvenienced us. A vast majority of the crowd that's there for the taping is literally just there for the taping. They bought tickets to do just that, or won them, or whatever, and when the taping was done, they had to leave, so it's not like those crazy crowds filled the park for the rest of the night.  Plus, they're done pretty early in the day, since they need the light to be right for filming. By dinner time, it was just like any other day in the park."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2sqk,Imbris,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:35 2015 UTC,Wow. That press release is just full of the awe and wonder of Disney magic! </end sarcasm>
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2sqk,Zombies_Grace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:33 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll sponsor repainting all of the bland and faded coloration throughout Future World as well!
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2sqk,aryndelvyst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"I could see this as being an agreement to get paint cheaper for when they do the DHS expansions.  I can imagine those negotiations.  Disney: ""Can you give us this paint cheaper?"" Glidden: ""No"" D: ""What if we hosted a thing that advertises your company in a creative way? G: ""Free advertising in a very well traveled area?  take all the paint you want!""  Obviously in an arrangement outlined above the advertising isn't free, but you know, as long as they think it is."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e408l,Curmudgy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"I would recommend subscribing to mousesavers.com and watching the off-season sale at the beginning of the year. If you can jump on it, you have a chance to get around the $300 mark (we did it for BW this year.) In addition, sometimes you can stack orbitz discount codes on top of the Disney discounts, and get a little bit more off (usually 10-15%.) Or you can watch for annual passholder discounts, which will up your ticket price by $200-$300 but will take you down toward that $300/night cost. Or, you can check into renting DVC points and go for a studio villa at BC. At this far out, that's entirely do-able."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e408l,mkhayes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:52 2015 UTC,"Regarding 2, look into renting DVC points.  Just checked David's Vacation Club Rentals because I used them in the past, and Beach Club is listed at $240 per week night (weekend night $256) in September 2016.  Here's a quick overview, but definitely look into cons of renting DVC points before deciding if it is right for you:  http://www.mousesavers.com/other-disney-vacations/disney-vacation-club/#rentpoints"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,Joytothesquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:38:35 2015 UTC,You can get into MK with a MNSSHP ticket at 4pm.  So it's worth it.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,sil3nt8o8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:33 2015 UTC,But their plane lands at 7 so they won't be there until 8:30.  Is it still worth it for half the time?
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,Cheletor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yes that is my dilemma. Our original plan was to land and just take it easy, get some food, and be rested for our week at the parks. But I was also a little sad when I realized we could have gone to MNSSHP if we had planned to come one day earlier. So I'm just unsure of what to do."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,ijustwantmybikeback,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"It's a blast you can go trick or treating and most everything is open the whole time (splash mountain at night is awesome!) I'm not big on shows or parades and I even loved the parade. We had a lot of fun when we went back in 2013. It was just my wife and myself and we took a four day trip on a whim, barely any planning, just to go for the party. If you don't end up going this time I definitely highly suggest going back to enjoy the whole party."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,lt08820,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:47 2015 UTC,You can do a sizable portion of the park in 4 hours during MNSSHP. Definitely see the parade and bring extra bags if you want more chocolate. Final night they are giving it away by the bagful
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3xgp,JohnnyFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"Apparently the last night is not as packed as you think, because kids still do want to do Halloween the old-school way.  So with a moderate crowd that would slowly peter out, if you got into the park at the normal entrance time of say 4:00pm, or even a bit later (say 6:00), 6 hours is more than enough to hit maybe 66% of the park, and if you plotted it out to hit the highest priority rides at the end (Mine Train/Peter Pan/the 3 mountains) you could be a near walk-on. It would take some planning but it's doable, just depends on how much you're willing to spend."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3dm3,TheOriginalRK,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:10 2015 UTC,KEEP IT

WaltDisneyWorld,3e3dm3,Zashiony,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"I've never done MK before opening, but I did do France in EPCOT. It was a lot smaller experience, but it was still really cool. MK in the morning (nearly the entire park) has to be 10x better. I think you should definitely keep it. Make sure you take some pictures of the castle for me!"

But after doing a bunch of research I decided to grab early BoG reservations (I wasn't able to get earlier than 8:20) and I'm psyched!

WaltDisneyWorld,3e3dm3,heathere3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it'd be cooler to see the empty park without people in it (which is amazing) than the show they do at rope drop. It's just some people dancing and some characters arrive on the train. Entertaining, but seeing an empty magic kingdom is a rarer opportunity."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e3dm3,Blubtrflygrl1,0,Tue Jul 21 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen both, and agree that the empty park is MUCH more amazing to see!"

WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,DisneyGirl311,4,Tue Jul 21 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely LOVED AKL.  That said, personally, I would never stay there with kids unless it was part of a split stay and we were only staying there on rest days or AK days.  Even with a car, it is a long commute to MK.  You're looking at a half hour or more by the time you drive over, park at the TTC, then ferry or monorail to MK.  If you're spending minimal time at MK, then AKL is fantastic.  Considering the ages of your kids though, I assume you'll be there a lot, and I personally wouldn't want to do that commute every morning on vacation."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,SenjiDogMom,3,Tue Jul 21 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"We just booked Animal Kingdom Lodge (Kidani Village) with a savannah view! We decided to rent DVC points and it wound up being insanely cheaper than just renting through Disney. Honestly, the idea of having wild animals hanging outside of our balcony was just too much of a plus so we had to do it. If you have questions I've been reading anything I can get my hands on this last week ha!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,momentumlost,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:36 2015 UTC,You absolutely can see animals from the balcony. As long as you have a Savannah view room. But before you cancel your club level at Poly you might want to check for club level availability at AKL. There are very few rooms and it can be difficult to get a reservation for. If it's available I'd say swap. It really made my family's annual Disney trip seem like a once in a lifetime experience.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,starryeyed_cj,2,Tue Jul 21 12:53:59 2015 UTC,We stay at AKL with a savannah view room every chance we get.  There's something magical about walking out on your balcony and watching the zebras and giraffes walk by!
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,heathere3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the head's up, looks like I'll be making some phonecalls today to see what they've got for availability. I'll be traveling with a 2 and 4 year old, I have to think they'd freak with excitement seeing a giraffe wander by our room- heck, I would! lol"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,starryeyed_cj,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:47 2015 UTC,Definitely go to where they give you night vision goggles to see the animals by the swimming pool. It's awesome. During the day if you are having downtime at the resort go to the different stairwells and you'll see the animals tend to flock (I think they might actually be giant holding areas) We had a room by a watering hole and could see the animals playing in front of our balcony all evening and night :) Have a magical vacation.
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,Mickusa,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:17 2015 UTC,"Totally Biased.. I love the Poly, just have not been able to afford the stay there yet.. If I could I would go poly all the way. Trader sams and the ability to see the Castle/fireworks/sevenseas lagoon, Monorail, Contemporary all from the beach. Sorry not even a question ( and I have not even mentioned trader sams and the dole whip yet ) oops I just did.. : )"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,tdt0005,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"I think AKL is the nicest, best themed resort on property. But I also can not even see myself spending the money on a Deluxe resort that does not give us a location advantage. In fact, that is the only reason (for me) to stay at a Deluxe resort period. I don't see a whole lot of value added to moderate/deluxe resorts because I basically spend all my time in the parks anyway. But everyone is different."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,GingerCookie,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all your tips and suggestions everyone, it was really helpful! We decided to stick with the Polynesian for two big reasons: 1) our kids are really young (2 and 4), and staying at the AKL would require a ton of driving, in and out of the car, into strollers, out of strollers, completely disrupting mandatory nap times, etc., plus I think they'd appreciate AKL, the animals and learning about the culture when they're a little bit older; and 2) about 90% of our current reservations are on the monorail loop or a boat ride away- we've got 'Ohana (right at the resort), Be Our Guest, 1900 Park Fare, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, Cinderella's Royal Table, Mickey's Backyard BBQ, and California Grill, all of which are a hop, skip and a jump from the Polynesian.  I started typing up an itinerary based on driving to and from AKL to all of these reservations and started asking myself 'why the f am I putting myself and my family through such torture on our vacation?!' lol  Plus it's been my dream since I was 7 years old to stay at the Polynesian, I can't let go of the dream now that I'm this close!  And seriously...DOLE WHIP!!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,MikeT75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"If you have a savannah view room, you can see animals. But there are also plenty of places at the hotel (overlooks, porches, etc) where you can chill and watch them too."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,martymcSOOfly,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard great things about AKL, that the theming is gorgeous and respectful to the culture. I'm dangerously close to making the jump- I hate that the Polynesian is still under construction, we were booked there last year but the resort was so ripped up that we ended up getting moved to the Grand Floridian at the last minute (not that I'm complaining, GF was stunning!). You can't beat the Polynesian's location though, and I love the nostalgia of that resort, it's a Disney original!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e2drt,JohnnyFire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:22 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue booking for my late August trip - 34 days to go! What I did was, I booked three nights at the Poly and then four nights at CBR, splitting up the trip. Yes, we have to move from resort to resort, but we save money staying at a deluxe resort on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday with convenient access to Magic Kingdom and all of the ammenties and conveniences of staying at a Magic Kingdom resort, then get to enjoy the savings of a moderate (we love CBR) and the convenience of staying close to Epcot, DHS, the water parks and Disney Springs.  Point: You may be able to do the same if you cannot decide between the two resorts. And if you are concerned about the inconvenience of switching between resorts, don't worry, people do it all the time. Its actually pretty common."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e296b,dylanswitch,4,Tue Jul 21 15:33:47 2015 UTC,Maybe the fast passes aren't open because they aren't SURE it will open that day. I would keep checking because they may release them closer to the actual opening date

WaltDisneyWorld,3e296b,sushixninja,3,Tue Jul 21 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"Here's a few tips if you can't get a fastpass: either make a beeline for POTC right when the park opens so the line isn't too insane (that's how we got on Ariel's ride with a short line and no fastpass); alternatively, ride lines shorten during parades because a bunch of kids drag their parents out of line to see the show- that's when we rode Dumbo and the teacups with no lines. Hope this helps, have fun on your trip! =)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e296b,DisneyGirl311,3,Tue Jul 21 12:21:17 2015 UTC,"Also if you're able to, stay after the fireworks, a lot of people leave the parks at this time.

WaltDisneyWorld,3e39w1,SwivelChairMadness,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:18 2015 UTC,Has he ever been available to meet anywhere?   I don't think he is available to meet.  I do know they won't send him out if the conditions are wet in any way.  So if it rains just before the parade or during the parade there is a good chance he won't be out.

We were able to afford to stay on property which at Land there was no way we could. Staying on property has its major perks with transportation to the parks, magic hours and of course the staff at Disney is always cheerful and happy to help."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Kayylah,4,Tue Jul 21 04:26:40 2015 UTC,"At the same time, you can stay off property at Disneyland for much cheaper than a value resort at WDW and still walk to the parks. To me, what you are being charges the most for at WDW deluxe resorts is LOCATION. At DLR, cheap non-disney hotels have more of a location advantage that the values, moderates, and many of the deluxe resort at WDW. You may not feel quite as much like you are in the bubble, but you can still have a 10-15 minute walk to 100% of the parks. At WDW, the best you can hope for is a 10 minute walk to 50% of the parks."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,tdt0005,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"Personally I love resorts like Coronado Springs and Port Orleans. Those are places where I enjoy spending time just walking around, enjoying the walkways, scenery, and amenities. A cheap hotel near Disneyland just doesn't offer that.  I would even argue that a WDW moderate resort is a nicer place to spend time than the Grand Californian. It's an experience that only WDW can offer thanks to all of that space.  Which of these is better is a matter of personal preference."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Pleakley,2,Tue Jul 21 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"I would argue it is far cheaper to stay at Disneyland. Unlike Walt Disney World where you really need to stay on property to get a good experience, at Disneyland you can pick and one of the dozens of major, reputable hotels that are a block away (and walking distance to the park). I would put any of those high-end hotels up against the best Walt Disney World hotels any day and they are 1/2 to 1/4 the cost!  I would actually argue that being basically forced to stay at a Disney hotel when at Walt Disney World is a detractor, not a benefit (and I'm even a Disney Vacation Club member and go several times a year!)"

Disneyland, for example can be a day or two trip, while Disney World is stretched out, with dozens of resorts, restaurants, spas, golfing, fishing, camping sites, Yeha Bob, A Michelin Star restaurant, A boardwalk that is a day in itself, blah de blah, you all know what I'm saying.  Then Disneyland, while it can be a shorter trip, you can do more per day. More rides, more compressed for more accessibility. Some rides are even better over there. I prefer Space Mountain over there than to Florida's. Their Pirates I prefer more. But I prefer Jungle Cruise here. ToonTown is better than the circus. But we got Be Our Guest, Gaston's Tavern, stuff like that. I think Florida's Fantasmic is a bit more grandiose. But they have World of Color. Florida has more fireworks, however.  They both feel really good, but they're both ever so slightly different."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,brucemanhero,5,Tue Jul 21 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"I think the Fantasmic! in Disneyland is simply magical and wonderful. Using the Rivers of America for a show with huge ships and dragons that pop out of nowhere is... well, awesome!  The Fantastic! at Disney's Hollywood Studios (or whatever I am supposed to be calling that now) is a poor substitute for the original over at Disneyland. The ships are laughable. The music isn't as catchy. The dragon is just sad. And that was all custom built for the show! Epic fail! It is so bad we bring our Disneyland friends there to laugh at it."

Breakfast at the Boardwalk Bakery and people/seagull watching.  Play the traditional mini-golf course at Fantasia Gardens.  Lunch at one of the many great restaurant options.  Some resort touring and another round of mini golf, this time on the more difficult fairways course.  Watch some of the entertainers that perform on the Boardwalk.  You could even do a boat ride from resorts.  Dinner at another one of the great restaurants, followed by ice cream at beaches and cream or cupcakes from the Bakery.  Watch Illuminations from the Boardwalk.  Sounds like a pretty great day to me, and all that without getting shit faced at Jellyroll's.  Doesn't even include the arcade games, surrey bikes, shopping at resort gift shops, etc."

I come from a land where the boardwalk along the ocean is five miles longs and has several piers' worth of rides and games (ferris wheels, coasters, games of 'skill', carousels, etc...). So, I'm going to go all Crocodile Dundee on you and say, ""That's no' a boar'walk. Now this is a boar'walk.""  Welcome to Seaside, NJ  One of the piers  If you're thinking, ""Where have I seen this place before?"" It's because of these New York vacationing jokers.  So, yeah, I don't regard Crescent Lake's Boardwalk to be an all-day affair. It's nice. But it compares to a real boardwalk like Epcot's France compares to real Paris.  :)"

WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Pleakley,6,Tue Jul 21 21:26:55 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. It's a comparison of two different experiences.   Each resort does some things better than the other, and which one is better comes down to what a guest wants from their visit.   Disneyland can offer a quick, cheap, and efficient vacation. WDW is more likely to offer an extended more immersive experience."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Jennyfromseattle,4,Tue Jul 21 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"Disney World can be an immersion experience. If you stay on property, you are all Disney all the time and it is a total escape from real life. I remember in Disneyland going on a ride that had some height and being able to see the fast food places and hotels outside the park fence. There's something magical about being away from it all and in the Disney bubble."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,bencredible,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"X-Posting this from the other X-Post  Neither park is better than the other. They are both the same and yet incredibly different. Each park hosts to a completely different type of user and each has their own special magic.  Disneyland  It is smaller and more intimate. Easier to walk from location to location. Weather is almost always amazing. There are subtle details throughout the park that no other park has, even Walt Disney World. The food is reasonable and pretty good, even for quick service. Generally speaking, on any given day over 50% of the park visitors are annual pass holders and know the park fairly well.   Walt Disney World  You are transported to a completely new world. To get to the park you must take a monorail or boat (er, mostly). It is larger and can hold a lot more people. Because it is larger the landscaping in certain areas can be better or allow for in-park picnics. Since the weather generally includes rain, the queues are indoors and very, very well themed all the way through. It is like the queue for Indiana Jones in Disneyland, but on every ride! Generally speaking, on any given day 70% of visitors are  there for their first time and have a sense of awe and wonder about them.   So in conclusion, if you forced me to pick a park I'm not sure I could! I love them both just in different ways. Besides, the correct answer is Epcot anyhow ;)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,mr_one_liner,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"Obviously both have their perks, and DL has its many supporters, so I'll take the WDW side just for fairness!   Quantity: more parks, more unique rides, more outside the parks activities, more fireworks, etc. Seclusion: not being in the middle of a city means a lot to me. It's like a hidden fantasy land you have to trek to get to instead of just a park on some city block. It helps with the magic. Yes, WDW has urban areas beginning to get built up around it, but it's not as packed as Anaheim yet, and driving on the resort grounds for a few miles gives you the experience of a long, rural trek. Non-park vacations: golf, water activities, camping, etc. Can't do that at DL. Beer Around the World: Parks are supposed to be ALL ages, right? Really cool weather: most people call this a minus but I LOVE thunderstorms."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Witt6,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"Because WDW has EPCOT. If Westcot actually became a thing, then... yeah."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,Where-is-the-rub,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know about amount of attractions per se, but attraction density is definitely larger at DL."

WaltDisneyWorld,3e0yzm,alternativecheese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"1) there are more parks, therefore more things to do 2) there are more Disney hotels and resorts, therefore you're still in the Disney state of mind when you go back to your hotel 3) it has its own land and that means there isn't a city like throwing distance from the park which detracts from the experience"

WaltDisneyWorld,3e1btg,saireeberry,4,Tue Jul 21 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"Have stayed at all value and moderate and a couple deluxe Disney hotels.  Have stayed at Hilton, B Resort, Doubletree Suites and Wyndham at DTD. If you are flying then transportation to the Disney hotels is free. To the DTD hotels you will need to rent a car or pay a taxi and Orlando taxi costs are high. DTD hotels have their own bus shuttle service that is free and not bad but no where near the system Disney has. Check closely as the DTD hotels have a variety of resort fees and parking fees that can add up. DTD hotels do not get Extra Magic Hours (Hilton has until Dec 31) and you book FP+ at 30 days like all offsite.  Disney hotels book at 60 days.  These are the BIG perks to staying in Disney hotels. If you plan lots of DTD time then those hotels are a plus since you can walk and not deal with buses in all the construction mess. Lots of deals are offered for DTD so do your homework to get the best rate.  Disney hotels will have Room Only Discounts and some packages.   Only Disney Hotel guests can book the Dining Plan if that is something you are interested in."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e1btg,MouseClues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the DTD hotels (non-Disney) that have additional fees. I decided to stay with a Disney property, I enjoyed their perks a lot more. Especially the Extra Magic Hours."
WaltDisneyWorld,3e1btg,doubtzen,2,Tue Jul 21 05:53:07 2015 UTC,"Firstly if you're going in a couple of months and haven't booked a hotel yet you may have limited choices. Disney allows visitors to start making reservations 499 days prior to arrival.  IMO I would stay on site if you have the budget, there are very few rooms on Disney property that cost $1000 a night, most rooms depending on hotel/size/view can cost any where between $140-$350 for value and moderate.  If you don't mind sharing your budget and dates that you will arrive/depart we could probably be more helpful?  I've only stayed onsite and I never had any issues of any consequence.

You lose the immersion as an on property resort, but it is more valuable, and my room was a good size, clean, buffet included in the resort fees, with a dvd rental kiosk at the lobbies, shuttles to the park (I hear these are closing down), gift shops to replace your (my) broken sunglasses, and we had a great time."

I have stayed at the Old Key West Resort and I enjoyed taking the water taxi transport to Downtown Disney whenever I had a break from visiting the parks. Saratoga Springs is also nearby and offers the water taxi to Downtown Disney. The Port Orleans properties such as Riverside and French Quarter also have water taxis to Downtown Disney. Most of the resorts are within close proximity to the parks, they offer free transportation and free parking if you decide to drive your vehicle to the parks."

You will save money on the bookings, many of them have comparable ammentieis to a Disney resort, and you also have the option of finding lodging conveniently located between other Orlando-area attractions. Just a thought... :-)"

It's in the Epcot area and you can walk to Epcot and even Hollywood Studios. It's part of the Disney on-site transportation system, you get the Extra Magic hours, and 60 day Fastpass reservations. Also since they are not owned by Disney, you can find better discount on rooms especially if you have a Costco memebership or something."

Reservations do open up all the time, but especially at 5 days before the date, which is the last day for no-penalty room cancellations (which then means people tend to cancel any dining reservations they have) or at whenever the deadline is for cancelling dining reservations w/o the $10 fee (this is usually 24 hours in advance, but can also be 48 or 72 depending on the restaurant.)

WaltDisneyWorld,3dymfr,SonicShitStorm,4,Mon Jul 20 18:17:08 2015 UTC,Could be. Drainage was my first thought but there are drainage canals throughout the lot. There are also wetlands throughout the property and adjacent to the lot.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dymfr,tdt0005,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:53 2015 UTC,That's a good point.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,FeedMeCletus,4,Mon Jul 20 12:51:40 2015 UTC,"I have a very similar bag  that worked out very well.  Also, their Travex mountain shirts are terrific - they dry in like 5 minutes and are super comfortable in the heat."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,FeedMeCletus,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:38 2015 UTC,I love those mountain shirts - they are perfect for Orlando heat!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,Reneeisme,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"This is a bit gross, but I wore mine two days in a row (with a backpack causing back sweat) and it smelled as fresh as it was when I put it on.  Probably not a feature they want to advertise, but handy all the same :-)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,ubergeek0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:57 2015 UTC,good feedback!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,frankyn00,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have it who can comment on durability?  I have lost several packs over the years to carrying water bottles for a family, along with assorted bottles of sunscreen, etc.  Water is heavy, and the bottoms seem to tear out pretty readily on these light weight packs."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,ilovebelle,3,Mon Jul 20 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"if overloaded it could easily wear out, but I've had it stuffed pretty full and never felt like any seams were in danger of letting go. at $15 a piece you could probably buy 3 of them and distribute the weight ;-)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,ilovebelle,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"gracias! I've been researching good park bags, and the ones I've found that I like have all been $60+! for $15, you can't go wrong."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,ZzShorty,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:15 2015 UTC,can't beat $15!!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,Spacecowboy1992,3,Mon Jul 20 17:20:31 2015 UTC,Can anyone comment on the sling version of the bag? A sling pack seems a bit more comfortable than a traditional backpack.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,Spacecowboy1992,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"While I've never used one, I was just in a store yesterday and had my hands on one. Seemed pretty comfortable for someone with a small frame, but for anyone medium-sized and larger it would be pretty uncomfortable."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,AmberHeartsDisney,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:38 2015 UTC,Not sure if you've already ordered but I own a very similar version to this one. I think mine is the non packable version.   It was awesome when I went two years ago and I plan to bring it this year as well! It held everything I needed including a flannel shirt.   Perfect size and the one I have can be configured to sit on either shoulder by just clipping to the other side of the bag. I totally recommend it!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,AmberHeartsDisney,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:01 2015 UTC,Me and my soon be be wife will be going to Disney at the beginning of September for our honeymoon and I was wondering if a backpack would be a helpful or a burden packing it all day? I have a kind of bulky Swiss army back pack now but the one you linked looks like it would be a lot more comfortable for her to pack when we take turns. How long is this sale and how long is the free shipping code good?
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,AmberHeartsDisney,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure on either the sale length or the coupon code, but I can say it's totally worth having a light backpack. To give you an idea of what I packed when I was down there with my daughter and I last September:   2x disposable ponchos (buy a few of these before you head down. $.99 at target/walmart/etc.)  Sunscreen (stick for the face, spray bottle for the arms)  Flip flops (for the water rides)  Zip-loc gallon bags GoPro + batteries + iPhone in a zip-loc  ID, credit card and some cash (in case the magic band failed)  Various hair elastics and headbands for the kiddo    It ends up being still pretty light, but all that stuff came in really handy"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,oldtimemovies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:38 2015 UTC,Ordered! Thanks!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,AmberHeartsDisney,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"Seconded. My dad and I each have one of these, and we use it every time we go to Disney, or just travelling in general!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxv9i,AmberHeartsDisney,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"Nice, I had an LL Bean one on my wish list to keep an eye on for our trip next year, but this one actually looks nicer and you can't beat $15. Thanks for the head's up!"

The only downside-ish is that I had to move from Port Orleans French Quarter to Port Orleans Riverside. I don't know much about Riverside so I guess I have to do some research. Anyone know any good websites to look at?"

WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,pygmypuffle,0,Mon Jul 20 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"The upside to FQ is the shorter walk to the buses, I believe? I went to Riverside and it made my girlfriend cry cause of how beautiful the place was. Riverside also has a good sized food court where we had breakfast everyday, it has Yeha Bob (which is fun to sit and watch/drink to), and yes, we were happy, good experience."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,brucemanhero,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"Wow I'm glad I jumped at the special email offer a couple months ago, because Riverside has no deal available for when I'm staying there in November!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,Imbris,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:02 2015 UTC,This is what kinda scares me about next year. I really would love a discount (who wouldn't!) but I decided to go it on my own. Now I feel like I should've used a travel agent to get a better chance at the discount.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,Lykii,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't use a travel agent, just got lucky and got the email offer. It was actually 20% off Riverside through December so I'm paying $172 a night (before fees) for a preferred room. Feels like a steal!!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,Imbris,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:00 2015 UTC,That IS a steal. I really hope for that email then. I'm at CBR but I'd pretty much take any discount that I can get as long as its a moderate.

I'm just hoping that Star Wars/Indiana Jones/Pixar stuff will actually be a bit more expanded soon!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,Lykii,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:21 2015 UTC,How does this work exactly ? I'm booked already do I call and ask to see if they can apply it to my trip? I can't change it online it is saying to try again later.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,Twohourdelay,3,Mon Jul 20 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I was able to go to my reservation and click change reservation to do it.  If that's not working for you, definitely call.  And try to call asap because they do run out of rooms at the discounted rate."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,AmberHeartsDisney,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:14 2015 UTC,Yeah you would need to call and rebook.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy0c7,mrdigdoug,2,Mon Jul 20 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"I did that this morning, but be prepared to wait. I was on hold for 45 minutes. But they were able to apply the discount to my existing reservation, and it saved me quite a bit."

With our Hotel.com rewards saved up, we cut $600 off our stay for a total of $1020 for seven nights - AND we earn an extra Hotels.com rewards night!

That meant we were in MK about an hour before early ADRs were let in (We left our resort at 6:30 to be in MK by 7 I believe). We were taking our bridal photos on the stage of the castle when early ADRs were let in. It was nothing compared to the rush at rope drop but I was really surprised at the rush that was coming toward us. It was really cool to see and double fun because I was up on stage in my wedding garb and had all these people rushing towards us.  Something else really cool was that before the early ADR guests were let in, there were announcements every 5-10 minutes says 'the hub area, Main Street, Fantasyland and Liberty Square must be show ready in X minutes. All vehicles must be removed from these areas' - we had to park in Frontierland to keep our vehicle off stage even though that meant walking all the way to Be Our Guest in my dress and hubby's tux."

Back in the late 80s, I went with a youth group and we got there very early so we were first into the park among the general population. When they let us through the gates, we made a mad dash for Space Mountain and the park was empty in front of us and there was a crowd coming in behind us. We were first into Space Mountain and we managed to ride 3 or 4 times before a line really began to form. (They actually made us exit and run around through the line again to get back on.)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dvg3t,strangebru,4,Sun Jul 19 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"The park opens at 9, yep. So we got in 1:15 before or so. The crowd wasn't as bad since it was just the breakfast line, but we got over to Mine Train just as the rest of the park was entering, which was scary."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dzq9k,mrardente,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:53 2015 UTC,"Is BOG worth it?   This is interestingly pretty open to debate.  The theming is incredible -- it's one of the best themed places in the park, and if you like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, you have to go just to see it.  There's also something to be said for the location right in MK.    However, the food gets mixed reviews (especially at lunch, when some people rave and others just don't get what the fuss is all about), and the main dining area is pretty crowded and has an almost mess hall sort of feel to it.  My wife and I don't consider it anything special, but, that said, we're going twice in September when we go for two weeks, so take all that for what it's worth."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dzq9k,TomCollinsEsq,2,Mon Jul 20 23:07:26 2015 UTC,"The Coral Reef is actually not bad for small kids, as the fish are a nice distraction, and sometimes Scuba!Mickey swims by. You might want to ditch the reservation and the sit-down atmosphere for the booths at the Food & Wine Festival--if the kids are just into chicken nuggets, etc, you can feed them at the American Adventure, or you can let them graze with the adults.   The character meal at Tusker House at AK is not the usual buffet (but has enough of the usual stuff to satisfy picky eaters), plus the characters, of course."

You get a lot more for your money with Universal, think about it this way.  You can fast pass 3 things per day at Disney World unless you want to wait in line for an hour at a kiosk, or ALMOST EVERYTHING ALL DAY LONG at Universal.  Not to mention that the food prices and quality are vastly better at Universal as well making it a better value too.  The in-park refill every 10 minutes coke freestyle mugs for $9.99/each vs the $4.00 per drink sodas at DW is a no brainer.  Disney parks are terribly overpriced, run down, and mismanaged but I still love them just the same.  I stopped buying merchandise and eating in Disney's parks a few years ago, none of it is worth the money and the discounts are scarce.  I get 20% off at most places in Universal, and the food is excellent for the most part so why would I bother to eat at Disney?"

It's sometimes a better deal to buy annual passes and use the discount on the hotel, especially if you make the trip more than once a year.  That's true of both Disney and Universal."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,ImGrumpyYoureDopey,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. It's kind of a relief that it's a annual pass holder deal which would not have worked for me.   I really didn't intend to start a Disney vs universal thing. I was just trying to answer OP's question. Universal isn't doing anything wrong with their ticketing/pass system but imo Disney has made things much easier for the average vacationer.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,drdking,0,Mon Jul 20 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"I realized you weren't a troll after a couple more comments.  There's a lot of Universal hate here, I'm glad you're not in that group."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,LennyFackler,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:11 2015 UTC,I will say my only complaint about the MagicBands is how easy it is to spend money now ;)
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,ImGrumpyYoureDopey,2,Mon Jul 20 14:13:30 2015 UTC,"It makes everything easier.   Contrast with Universal. Stayed onsite to get early entry and express passes (which are fantastic perks btw). To enter park we used our paper tickets. Then show your hotel key (plastic thankfully) to access the sections which open early. Separate paper based express passes had to be scanned at every ride. Your park ticket was required again to ride Hogwarts express. And of course getting out your wallet to pay for everything.   And the reason I mention paper vs plastic is that the paper tickets and express passes are very flimsy and likely to get damaged or smudged by any moisture, even a bit of sweat. Not to mentioned some of the rides which get you absolutely drenched. Those paper passes are just one more thing you have to protect.   The whole trip I felt discombobulated and as if I was going to lose something. This feeling is heightened by the fact that many rides require that you put all of your belongings in a locker. So every few minutes you panic a little bit thinking ""where's my shit?""    I would probably think nothing of these minor hassles except that I've been spoiled by magic bands at Disney. While there you don't think about them much, but that's the point!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,LennyFackler,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"You overcomplicated this, don't blame Universal.  I've never needed to do any of it.  Buy a lanyard, it makes it trivial to get scanned for a fast pass.  You panicked because your stuff is secure in a locker?  Would you rather lose it while your ride car is upside down?  I have magic bands and I have universal cards and it's funny because I don't have any of these problems with either.  We won't even talk about how you have an access card, a Magic Band, and a discount card if you're a pass holder and you have to have the discount card, ID, and a credit card on your person to use your discounts at Disney World or to even get into the parking lot most of the time.  Edit: Realized comments were not a troll."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,ImGrumpyYoureDopey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:25 2015 UTC,I had a great time at universal and will go back. Lanyards are a good idea but I didn't think of them ahead of time. Once there I didn't want to spend time looking for them. I will definitely have them for the next trip.   My point is that magic bands are a real convenience. It may seem trivial to manage your various Universal cards and tickets to a regular visitor but I found it annoying.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dxwzw,justaperson_88,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"I had a great time at universal and will go back. Lanyards are a good idea but I didn't think of them ahead of time.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dy6vu,sports_is_life,2,Mon Jul 20 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"I would say about 2-3 months from the trip. They might say some hotels are book as well as some flights, but keep trying. They sometimes hold rooms so they can fill others, but I would say thats a good time to start booking. But honestly, go through the Disney travel program. They take care of EVERYTHING, including plane. Just call them up and tell them what you want! You're gonna have an amazing time :)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy6vu,madbear3320,2,Mon Jul 20 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"Start tracking the flights now so you can get an idea of what you're going to spend. We have a good idea of what a good flight price is (for two adults, we usually spend a combined $400 direct for RT, 1st class) so I usually book flights as close to the trip as I can, especially since every time we book more than a month out our flights are inevitably switched on us.   One of the awesome things about booking direct with Disney is that you don't have to pay it all at booking. You just need a deposit. And if you, say, book a resort now through Disney and two months from now a cheaper room comes along, they can switch it all for you very easily. You can pay it off at your leisure until (I think) 45 days before your arrival. you can use a Disney travel agent but there is really no need when they make it so easy for you to do it yourself.   Meals and FP+, if they're that important to you, I'd book at the booking dates as soon as they're released. We rarely book but go often so if we miss anything it's not a big deal."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy6vu,nerderella,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"If you're planning to rent DVC points, the sooner the better as those get booked quickly in my experience.  I really recommend this method if you're looking for a deluxe resort at a value price.  There are definitely downsides to renting points, but IMO it's worth it.     If there is a hotel, a restaurant, or a ride you have your heart set on, then you should book early.  For example, restaurant reservations can be made 180 days in advance, so if you want to try the most popular restaurants, you really need to book those exactly at your 180 day window, which is coming up fast for you!  Ride Fastpasses are at the 60 day window for onsite guests.  If you're very easy going and don't mind missing the popular sit down restaurants or standing in line for over an hour for certain rides, then you can hold off.  It's really a preference thing.  Personally, I plan and book far in advance, so that I know we will have a view of the fireworks from a nice restaurant, won't have to wait in a ridiculous line for 7 dwarfs mine train, etc.  But again, that's my preference to plan early."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy6vu,SenjiDogMom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:52 2015 UTC,So overwhelming! I definitly want to go 2 nights at nice restaurants 1 at MK and the night we will spend eating/drinking at Epcot.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dy6vu,SenjiDogMom,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"You can book the restaurants at 180 days without the onsite hotel reservation.  However, the hotel reservation allows you to book for the length of your stay.  So if you're trying to get into something that's hard to get (like Be Our Guest) and you're staying 6 days, you could look at the 186th day when others are limited to 180 (that also means guests with a 10 day stay are looking at 190).  For an actual nice sit down dinner at Magic Kingdom, I would say Be Our Guest OR look at some of the Monorail resort options.  It'd be a quick ride over to the Polynesian for a dinner at 'Ohana for example.  Some people report having no trouble finding last minute reservations, so you could always hope for that too.  I just like to know that I have the reservation vs hoping I'll get it.  The stress, planning, and reserving now makes it a more relaxing trip when I'm there because I know I've got it all worked out already, but again that's just my preference! Lots of people like to just look at what has reservations open the night before and just book it then."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dyl5c,TheBroticus42,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"First thing is to make your hotel reservations now if you haven't done so already. Don't get your heart set of Be Our Guest (BOG), it's extremely popular and the reservations are hard to get. I’m not saying it’s impossible, just difficult.  IMO how you should approach your vacation is like this (assumes you’re staying onsite):  Firstly print out a crowd calendar for the days you are going, they can be found at TouringPlans.com (need a subscription, but it’s cheap and has other useful features) and easywdw.com (free)  Next schedule your park visits by finding the park that is least crowded the first day, the next day, so on.  Next schedule your Advance Dinner Reservations (ADR) the day you’re eligible (you can start at 6am)   Next schedule your Fastpass+ (leaving 2 hours from your ADR to the end of your next fastpass (this gives you enough time to eat, even if they seat you late and get to your next fastpass without missing it))  Link on FastPass+ Reservations: http://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/making-fastpass-reservations  Link on Advance Dining Reservatons: http://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/advance-dining-reservations"

WaltDisneyWorld,3dyl5c,MikeT75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"If you're going to Animal Kingdom twice, try making reservations for Animal Kingdom Lodge for dinner after one of your days at the park to eat at Sanaa. BoG is an obvious choice. Depending on when you are going, the new Jungle Cruise Skipper's restaurant might be open by then. Keep an eye peeled for a likely very popular new restaurant to visit! Hollywood Studios, Brown Derby is a great place to eat, but don't discredit the Prime Time or the Sci Fi Dine In. Depends on the fare you enjoy. Also, you could leave the park and take a Friendship boat over to Boardwalk, Swan, Dolphin, Yacht and Beach Clubs very easily, making Yachtsman and the restauarants in that area great options for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Epcot, Le Cellier is probably the most popular spot but its all subjective. Do you like steak? Then Le Cellier is for you. Personally, I prefer Biergarten or the restaurant in Mexico for the vibe of sitting outside and seeing a show. But, also, depending on what time of year you go, you might hit Flower and Garden or Food and Wine. If you do that, you might prefer to walk and round and gnosh rather than do a table service. Its a unique experience."

We found it really valuable to get to the parks early as you can, hit a ride or two, then hit up FP's. So I wouldn't make a fastpass until the first hour after opening, crowds should be pretty low when the parks open.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dw9tm,Kayylah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:16 2015 UTC,"You'll definetly want to use at least one fast pass on the Seven Dwarves Mine Train. Since you guys seem to be doing MK the most, you'll see that the wait for that ride is always guaranteed to be long. Using fast passes gets you in very quickly. I just came back a few weeks ago, and the most we waited for that ride was like ten minutes when the regular wait was like 180.   If you love thrill rides, you absolutely need a fast pass for the mountains (Space, Thunder, Splash). Space, in my own experience, has usually had the longest wait. I guess I'm biased because it's my favorite ride, but you should absolutely get a fast pass for it. For the other days, do a pass for Peter Pan since that wait is always wicked long. Haunted Mansion also tends to be really crowded during the day, too.  For HS, DO ONE FOR TOY STORY MANIA. I love the ride, but it's not worth the crazy waits. And again, if you love thrill rides, do one for RnRC and ToT. Personally we always do single rider lines since their shorter than fast passes, but it's always better to experience rides like that together. The most I saw Star Tours at was 40 mins, and that was just a few weeks ago, and even then we only waited like 30.   Personally I'm not a big Epcot fan, but Test Track and Soarin' are must-dos. Definetly do one for Soarin', or else you'll end up waiting at least an hour and a half. Nemo is another fun ride, but the waits can get a bit long, so maybe consider doing one for that. DON'T DO ONE FOR SPACESHIP EARTH. It's not worth it, I've never seen the line last more than 15 mins.  I'm also not a huge AK fan, but Everest and Dinosaur are among my favorite rides. Do one for Everest, or do single riders since you'll get to the front in a second. Primeval Whirl is usually a long-ish wait, and I wouldn't reccomend waiting for it without a fast pass. I love it, but it's short and not really worth the wait.   Sorry for the obnoxiously long response. Hope you guys have fun! :D"

Has anyone ever stayed at one of the resorts during a renovation time?  I'm worried it will diminish the experience."
WaltDisneyWorld,3du25e,radli80,2,Sun Jul 19 13:56:52 2015 UTC,"We went to the Wilderness Lodge in May and they were doing some external repairs/cleaning. We didn't notice it in the room or our floor at all, but walking to the MK boat there was heavy machinery just sitting on the grass and I found the scaffolding on the exterior of the building detracted slightly from the experience. Whether or not that diminishes the experience for you depends on what you're doing on your honeymoon.  WL is one of my absolute favorite resorts and we had a great time in May, but I personally won't stay there until the construction is done. Between what we saw going on at the hotel and the reports from the Poly during its recent, big refurb, I think it would diminish the experience.   There are a lot of other great hotels, so to me it seems like it's easier to stay at a different hotel - I love the Beach/Yacht Club."
WaltDisneyWorld,3du25e,Homerpaintbucket,2,Sun Jul 19 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"I stayed at Carribean Beach Resort both while it was initially being built and a few years ago while they were refurbishing the main pool.  Both times we were always far enough away where we didn't notice the construction at all.  Wilderness Lodge is set up a little different, but I'd have faith that Disney isn't going to let it bother guests."

I'll be there 9/22 to 9/27 (im losing my mind already waiting! pre-disney insanity!). I think your plans look good, but realistically i think they may change a bit with the kids moods. It's great you have breaks built in to your plans, super important! Have the kids done Mission Space or Tower of Terror? Are they thrill riders? I just worry they both may be intense for them, but you know them better than I (i always was a scaredy kid and didnt have the guts to go on ToT until i was 13!)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3duxnu,ivywinter,2,Sun Jul 19 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And we are in the same boat with the pre-disney insanity! The kids probably won't ride any of the thrill rides.

Some of the things you choose, e.g. Spaceship Earth, may not be worth using your face pass on. Later on in the day, Spaceship Earth is normally a walk on ride, or at the most like 10-15 minutes. Check the app or the boards to figure out if it would be better to try and switch the fast pass to a different attraction and just wait in line.   Also, remember you can use baby swap on fast passes. Just tell the cast member when you go through the line."
WaltDisneyWorld,3duxnu,TomCollinsEsq,2,Sun Jul 19 20:41:37 2015 UTC,We do have the app and check disboards just about everyday. My wife is not on reddit so I check this sub often. I always hope to find information about disney that she doesn't know about yet.  We struggled with picking our fast passes. Other than the tier one rides it was tough to book since the September crowds should make each ride a shorter wait anyways (we hope!).
WaltDisneyWorld,3duxnu,imjoeyournot,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:15 2015 UTC,No worries. I understand the problem with having to choose fast passes long before you actually go to the parks.

Really though, the plans sound excellent. The only thing I would consider is changing the Peter Pan fast pass to something else, but that's just me, I'm not really fan of it, but I understand a lot of people are.   Edit: I just read through the plans again, and I when I was there we didn't need a fast pass for Frozen sing along, I was there in April. Not sure if my case was just unique, but maybe some other people here can let you know if they think it's needed. Don't know if you planned on if, but fantasmic at HS was excellent.   Also, we used a fast pass for the electric light parade (was there with a almost 2 year old Daughter by the way) at magic kingdom, and then just walked up Main Street and had a great view for the castle show/ fireworks, so that worked out nicely for us."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dt28q,T_D_A_G_A_R_I_M,9,Sun Jul 19 04:34:31 2015 UTC,Very cool! Where is this located? What's the story behind how the design ended up in more than one place? I never thought about multiple of the same coaster being produced and ending up in different places around the world. I guess it makes sense for the company that spends a lot of time and money on engineering and designing the ride.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dt28q,Kickendekok,6,Sun Jul 19 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"Companies that design, engineer, and manufacture them sell them off the shelf essentially and it is the theme park that adds the theming to them. Vekoma is the company that made this one. Other big-name companies are B&M, Arrow, and Intamin. It's pretty interesting to see what is basically a theme and amusement Park Mall of does. At the IAAPA expo (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) each year in Orlando in November. Just like Comic-Con with rows and rows and rows of everything from bouncy houses to smaller rides to pop corn machines. And Dippin Dots. So much Dippin Dots."

WaltDisneyWorld,3duv7k,CajunCowboy654,4,Sun Jul 19 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"Just take your own car, it saves on costs. And when you are at disney, I would recommend just leaving the car at the resort, and take the complimentary transportation around the resort. This includes buses, boats, and the world famous monorail. Buses go from your hotel to the parks, waterparks, and downtown disney (plan for at least a 30-40 minute commute by bus, as they stop at multiple hotels)."
WaltDisneyWorld,3duv7k,sports_is_life,2,Sun Jul 19 19:28:15 2015 UTC,We are defiantly using the Disney transportation.  That is why we thought of renting since we wouldn't need a vehicle once there.
WaltDisneyWorld,3duv7k,GingerCookie,3,Sun Jul 19 19:59:14 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about renting DVC points? You may be able to stay at a deluxe resort for a similar price or slightly more than Pop.  Check out the plans at EasyWDW.com Lots of good advice on making fast passes, food options, how to tour efficiently. There's do much to research but this'll give you a great start."
WaltDisneyWorld,3duv7k,misspeelled,2,Sun Jul 19 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's a long drive, as I can attest from coming from Houston (which means by the time I'm in S. LA I've already been driving 4-5 hours at least. We used to drive, but honestly I won't ever do it again. It wears us out and by the time we've gone two days in the car we're tired when we get to Disney and that's not good. Then again flying can be just as tiring for some! If you're planning on any breakfasts at resorts, having your own car (rented or owned) is a lifesaver, but you can take taxis too.  Best piece of advice is to go to easywdw.com and figure out what days are best to go where. You're going at a great time! We go every year the week before that and it's usually nice weather and lower crowds. That said, you can always use some planning to figure out where you're going and what you want to do. I can't stress the amazingness of going at rope drop! Get there 30 minutes before the gates open and you can stroll right onto any ride you like, pretty much. Even if you're not morning people, trust me on this. There's nothing quite like getting to ride Space Mountain 3-4 times with no wait in the morning."

I think it has to do with the fact that people are more likely to behave obnoxiously in groups, especially large groups. And they're on vacation, so they're ""letting their hair down"" so to speak.   I know how you feel, though, I'm a local from the Space Coast as well. It really gets old being surrounded by large tour groups that are singing loudly in your ear.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,WaltDisneyWorldMOD2,9,Tue Jul 21 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"I only ever wear dresses to Disney. Florida doesn't get much wind so I never have to worry about showing anything off and you can buy some bike shorts if you're worried about that. They are light and breezy and outfits are so much easier to plan when it's just one article of clothing. I pair my dresses with cute keds or flats, some accessories and i'm good to go for the day!"

WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,PsychoCelloChica,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:49 2015 UTC,What kind of shoes? Prefer a comfie sandal and not sneakers...
WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,Kycb,2,Sat Jul 18 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"Just anything that you feel comfortable in. It's different for different people.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,moza_jf,4,Sat Jul 18 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Here's the album of most of what I wore.  I would worry about tripping over / being restricted by maxi dresses.

No cute flats or sandals for this girl!)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,ConvertsToMetric,3,Sun Jul 19 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"I go in late September usually, and it is still too hot for me to wear longer pants.  I usually wear khaki style shorts and a nicer tank top kind of shirt.  I worry about getting in and out of rides with a dress, but I do see a lot of women in dresses.  I just prefer to not be constantly worried about accidental views while loading/unloading from rides.  I'd say go for whatever you think will be most comfortable wearing in the heat.  It's not worth ruining your trip by wearing something that makes you uncomfortable."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,nerderella,4,Sun Jul 19 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Either capris or shorts, preferably in linen or cotton, and a light t-shirt.  There is an element that, because of the heat, and because I'm several thousand miles from home, I care less what I look like that I normally would.  Would love to try maxi dresses, but at 5 foot tall, I have trouble finding one that doesn't drown me!  Couple that with walking sandals, and a big floppy brimmed hat to keep the sun off my neck."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,7trainrat,3,Sun Jul 19 09:19:14 2015 UTC,"I wear dresses or shorts and skirts with varying lengths of sleeved tops. A lot of what I wear is camping gear that won't stretch out through the course of the day and provide an amount of SPF. Running skirts with built in spandex are also some of my go-tos.   I always wear sneakers in the park because I know they'll be comfortable. If I can run a marathon in them, the parks will be a cake walk.   One thing I'd strongly suggest is if you go the dress route, bring anti-chafe stuff (powder, body glide, etc), extra sunblock, and something to cover up with. The UV index in FL is always high and you don't want your trip ruined by a nasty burn."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,angelathefirefly,2,Sun Jul 19 12:44:44 2015 UTC,"I wear capri or cargo pants and a mid-to-dark colored t-shirt. You could wear the maxi dress if you are just walking around the world in Epcot, especially at night and if you are going to a restaurant for dinner. I would not wear one at MK, or AK though. To me AK is always REALLY hot. You might want to wear Capri pants and keep a pair of shorts in your bag to change into in case you get super hot, or soaked on one of the rides. I'm not a fan of shorts because I get sunburned."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dre99,Brandy_Alexander,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:50 2015 UTC,"I went at the end of August last year and this is what I wore. I'm 25 and usually worry about looking good when I go out, but honestly, by 3 PM I was so sweaty I was glad to just be comfortable! - Shorts (Usually running shorts or jean shorts--running shorts had the compression layer + top layer combo. I got them at target.) http://www.target.com/p/c9-champion-women-s-woven-short-with-compression/-/A-16847191#prodSlot=_1_11 - 2 racer back tanks. I got them at Target, too.

I tried to be stylish one time and ended up just worrying my outfit may get ruined from rides (water, getting things wrinkled, etc.). It wasn't much fun.  My last piece of advice is buy good shoes. It doesn't matter if you wear a dress, shorts, costume, whatever. Get a good pair of shoes. We walked 9-14 miles per day. I recommend Tevas and Chacos if you want sandals!"

WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,wdwguy,12,Sat Jul 18 14:59:53 2015 UTC,I can't emphasize this enough. When I was young I too would never go on an inversion coaster. Then one very similar to RnR opened in the theme park near my house and friends convinced me to go. Like RnR it was indoors and dark. It's disorienting in a good way and you don't feel it until it's over (unlike seeing it about to come up and start cringing on an outdoor).  After that I never had many problems with inversion coasters. Going on a dark inversion coaster as your first if highly recommended.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,isestrex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree on the ""pitch black"" part. It is no where near as dark as Space Mountain. There are a lot of black lights and lit up signs inside."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Italianman2733,14,Mon Jul 20 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"It is a great ride, and once you've started it's not scary at all. The scariest part is sitting in anticipation at the beginning, staring at the tunnel.  If you can handle Everest you can handle this. The inversions are tastefully done."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,PoppaDR3W,8,Sat Jul 18 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep your head plastered to the chair, especially when the coasters about to take off (fortunately, Aerosmith gives you a 3-2-1 countdown so you're ready for it).  There is only one ""loop"", the other two inversions are corkscrews.  You don't feel those as much, they're very smooth.  You will feel the loop, but you're going so fast in the coaster that it's over pretty quickly.  Make sure you lower the harness as low as you possibly can to reduce any sensation of moving during the brief upside-down moments.  Personally, I think it's a great coaster, probably my #2 ride at DHS (behind Tower of Terror).  I hope you get the chance to experience it, and I'd love to hear your experience when you're done!"

I thought I couldn't enjoy roller coasters but went on it,  encouraged to do so and then we rode it 3 more times before we came home. If you can do Everest, you can do the Rockin Roller Coaster. The inversions add a bit more of a thrill,  and I worried about my glasses,  but over all,  it was exciting and totally fun.  It certainly left a fun memory with me."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,sharribarri,4,Sat Jul 18 14:21:28 2015 UTC,Is Everest more intense than rnr?
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Gorillagodzilla,3,Sat Jul 18 14:32:57 2015 UTC,By far
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,StitchHasAGlitch,2,Sat Jul 18 15:05:35 2015 UTC,I think so.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,purplekites,2,Sat Jul 18 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"I think comparing them is a little bit apple and oranges. Everest does go quickly and has steep drops and banked turns but the ride is very smooth, RnR is a fast paced, roller coaster, less story."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,hood125,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that Everest is a different type of intense, I think that RnR is really an easy ride. For me the only downside of RnR is that my head shakes back and forth, that has bothered me more with age. But I would say Everest is pretty intense for some people, I mean it goes backwards as well as backwards in the dark too, I think you feel it more."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,CrystalElyse,2,Sat Jul 18 17:02:50 2015 UTC,What's the scariest part on Everest? I've ridden RnR but never had the guts to ride Everest and my husband says I will be riding it with him in October. I'm nervous.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Potterless12,4,Sat Jul 18 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Going backwards down a really, really high hill .... IN THE DARK!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Bedpanjockey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Hah! My husband said the scariest part is the long line.   We both think the going backwards in the dark is the scariest,  but I genuinely don't think I was scared, per se. It was enjoyable and ""scary"" because it was supposed to be."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,sharribarri,8,Sat Jul 18 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"For me, the worst part of the ride is the power launch. After that, I really enjoy it, and you barely notice going upside down.  The first time I road it, I was all prepped for the launch. They do a countdown, so when it said ""3-2-1 GO"" I was all set. Except, the ride didn't launch due to some error.  So I caught my breath, and prepped myself again as the Cast Member walked to the control panel. As I was getting ready to read the launch sequence again, she was actually just launching the ride.  Took the breath right out of me."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,snootchie_bootch,4,Sat Jul 18 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"Besides the initial quick start the ride is smooth. Its pitch black besides the lights that form around you and like I said its so smooth the inversions dont really feel like you think they would. Still really fun though. They take the picture right on the beginning when its shoots you into the tunnel, at least I think so I just woke up. I feel like it's even darker than space mountain. I know I'm repeating myself but its incredibly smooth and will not jerk you around if that's what your worried about. Also I'm almost 30 and hate it when people tell me Disney is for kids, I'm like shut the heck up, Disney is awesome! Im going to go ride the tea pots and the dumbo ride."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,AmericanHoplites,3,Sat Jul 18 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"You'll be focused on the acceleration. Don't sweat the inversions. The coaster isn't that long either.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Ghenges,3,Sat Jul 18 17:09:38 2015 UTC,You'll love it and want to go again.  If you've ridden Everest you can handle RRC.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,dawnrevolution,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"RnR was my first upside-down roller coaster (at the age of 27). After riding it, I started going on all kinds of crazy rides. RnR is a perfect 'gateway coaster' for people afraid of going upside down, IMO.  The inversions aren't that bad - the first one is barely noticeable, and the entire ride is so short that it's hard to have time to be afraid of the others. Definitely keep your head back during the launch and the corkscrew inversions later in the ride, or it'll get battered around a little, especially if you wear glasses.   If you like Everest and Space Mountain, and survived the orange side of M:S, I think you'll like RnR."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Bedpanjockey,3,Sat Jul 18 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"If you can do Everest and Space Mountain, you can do the RnR.  Its over in less than 2 minutes, I believe."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,DaveAnson,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"i was basically the same when i went my first time!  i was terrified of going on, and the loops and speed scared me, but i got peer pressured into it, and it was absolutely incredible!  it's a really good smooth coaster, and an awesome one to get you acclimatised to the loops!  just honestly force yourself on it, and you will love it, i promise!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,sweezey,3,Sat Jul 18 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"RnR isn't nearly as ""scary"" as Everest. It's a lot of dark, loud music and then ""signs"" glowing.

I was scared the first time I walked in to RR and saw the thing shoot off into the tunnel, but it's not even as bad as it looks. It's really quite fun and there is enough time between the inversions that you won't get disoriented."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,ianmilham,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"There is a bit during Everest where it banks hard and up to the left while you're in the dark/backwards bit.  It's almost a corkscrew.  I've heard people swear they were inverted at that moment.    So if you're wondering what an inversion feels like, it's actually less than that since you're going forward and its smoother."

WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,markf0wle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"RnR is a great first coaster in my opinion. The worst bit about it if you are nervous is anticipating the start which is really not as bad as you will be expecting & it only lasts 5 seconds. When you get underway the music in the car & the neon signs in the ride will be a pleasant distraction.  I think it's a really smooth coaster & it being in the dark helps to focus your attention on the neon signs & not on the coaster. You will barely notice the inversions, in all honesty I was surprised when you said there were three. I would've guessed at one had you asked me is how many there were. But the speed & everything, you'll barely notice them.  Keep your head back at the start, but the rest. You'll be fine, you'll know what to do."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqk3b,Homerpaintbucket,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:52 2015 UTC,The ride is over so fast you don't have time to be scared.  It's honestly the most fun experience I have ever had in an amusement park ever.

Panic panic panic all the way through to the cars. Then I sat in the seat and felt a bit better, but before you know it you're off and you'll have done two inversions. You'll be laughing and screaming the rest of the track and be sad when it's over, well that was for me anyway. I really recommend it, I was terrified at first but I would have felt worse if I missed out on it and it would be a shame for someone to miss out on it. Also it's very short so if you didn't like it it'll be over before you know it. Good luck!"

It is honestly one of the coolest feelings and that is coming from someone who hates the feeling of falling. I was terrified of thrill rides as a kid and the first real ones I went on were in Disney and I have to say it is  one of my favorite rides. I can't go on Mission: Space because of motion sickness but RnR doesn't bother me at all.

WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,angelathefirefly,4,Sat Jul 18 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, both. The characters are safari themed, so they're extra adorable looking, especially Goofy. And the food is superb. It's a mix of American and African breakfast food. TONS of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I go with my super picky parents, and they love the place. I'm an adventurous eater, and I love the place. It's good for everyone. Also, the juice they serve is fantastic. It's their version of orange juice, but it's more exotic."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,varineq,3,Sat Jul 18 15:56:49 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, sounds good. I'll have to add it to my list of places to go next time. Thanks!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,chrisd37,7,Sat Jul 18 17:22:00 2015 UTC,A Mickey Waffle at the Polynesian Counter Service restaurant for breakfast. Hot dogs at Casey's Corner in the MK for lunch. Eating around the world in Epcot for Dinner.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,NoahzArc,4,Sat Jul 18 13:51:01 2015 UTC,I like those little stands around the world...I had some Venezuelan corn cake that was really good...washed down by some German beer a few steps away!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,TribeFaninPA,4,Sat Jul 18 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"Breakfast:  Trail's End at Fort Wilderness has a GREAT breakfast buffet. Lunch:  No real favorite but we do like The Coral Reef Restaurant at Epcot Dinner:  I like Ohana, we've always enjoyed Chef Mickey's, and I like the fried chicken from Trail's End (same chicken they serve at Hoop-de-Doo"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Hysterymystery,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"Is the food at Chef Mickey's good? I've heard mixed reviews. We have reservations there for dinner because my daughter had her heart set on seeing ""Mickey with the chef's hat on"". I'm sure it'll be fun for the experience, but I was worried the food would be disappointing."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,TribeFaninPA,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"We like Chef Mickey's for the atmosphere more than the food.  The food is pretty standard buffet fare- not great, not bad.  I have never had a bad experience there, although some others have reported that they have."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,PoppaDR3W,3,Sat Jul 18 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"When I was there recently for the first time in a long time, Artists Palette in Saratoga Springs was awesome. Ham and cheese omelet for breakfast and the grilled chicken Caesar salad for dinner (perfect amount of dressing!). Lunch was wherever we were. Nothing seemed overly special, sadly. Just generic food."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Zashiony,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:07:27 2015 UTC,Some pretty awesome generic food.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Knightro2011,4,Sun Jul 19 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: Ohana. It's the best character breakfast plus I get to see my favorite character, Stitch  Lunch: Sunshine Seasons has a great mix of food options and it's a nice area to relax inside.  Dinner: San Angel Inn. Especially if you get a table by the boat ride. It's very nice to have a great dinner by the river."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,mritty,3,Sat Jul 18 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"The breakfast buffet at the Wave, in the Contemporary Resort. Roasted Pork Chop at Sunshine Seasons in Epcot's Land pavilion for lunch. At dinner time, over to Fort Wilderness to enjoy the fantastic (and affordable!) buffet at Trail's End."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,papasnork1,3,Sat Jul 18 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"Great question. I'm going to split between table service and counter service.  Table service; Breakfast at Boma, lunch at LeCellier, Dinner at Kona   Counter service; Breakfast at Sunshine Seasons, lunch at Be Our Guest, Dinner at Flame Tree Barbecue."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Solidtrip,3,Sat Jul 18 15:32:45 2015 UTC,"Can't have just one.   Breakfast : Cape May Lunch : Pecos Bills  Dinner : Cape May Seafood Buffet, Ohana, California Grille"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,melaisilme,2,Sat Jul 18 15:59:37 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: starring rolls, I know it's not that special but it's always the first place we go in the morning at HS and I love the ambience.   Lunch: Japan fast food pavillion. Sooooo good.  Dinner: Via napoli, because the pizza is amazing and I get to speak italian with the hot waiters. (they must hire their waiters based on appearance I swear)"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,CollegeRadioGuy,2,Sat Jul 18 14:25:26 2015 UTC,Really surprised none of these are on here so far!   Breakfast: Ohana Lunch: Crystal Palace Dinner: Liberty Tree Tavern
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,RAproblems,2,Sat Jul 18 14:47:52 2015 UTC,Breakfast: 1900 Park Fare Lunch: Columbia Harbor House Dinner: Ohana
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,TomCollinsEsq,2,Sat Jul 18 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: Boma.  Lunch: Le Cellier  Dinner: (excluding V&As, because that's unfair) California Grill in time for Wishes."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Hysterymystery,2,Sat Jul 18 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"What's great about Boma breakfast? I've never eaten there, but I hear people mention their breakfasts a lot."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,reeddool21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Unexplainable Emerson of African cuisine and atmosphere.  Tons of options, american dishes, Indian dishes and African dishes all melded together.  Plus they make a jungle juice for breakfast that makes fresh florida orange juice seem like river water."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,blindythepirate,2,Sun Jul 19 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"For a big breakfast, Chef Mickeys is my favorite. For something light, I would get a cheese danish from the coffee spot in the Polynesian resort.   For lunch, I would always go to Tortuga Tavern in Adventureland and get a build it yourself taco. But when I went last week, they changed the menu and no longer have the toppings bar.   The Grand Floridian quick service is really good and they have the best flatbread pizzas.  The Land in Epcot quick service has a lot of options to choose from.  For dinner, I have to do Cosmic Rays at least once and sit and watch Sonny Eclipse do his thing.   Hollywood Studios has a few good places to eat and I really like the 50's Prime Time Cafe. The Sci Fi drive in is a cool place to eat too.   And RIP the Concourse Steakhouse. Some of the best steaks I have had came from that place."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,mgpackers97,2,Sat Jul 18 16:00:14 2015 UTC,Breakfast has to be Old School Chef Mickey's. Nothing beats putting M&M's on your waffles.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Kaney88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"Ohana for breakfast, anywhere for lunch, and Yachtsman Steakhouse or the Restaraunt in Canada at Epcot for dinner"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,anaerobyte,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:27 2015 UTC,Breakfast: akershus/Norway/spelling Lunch: Columbia harbor house Dinner: haven't found a favorite yet
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,MajesticPhenomena,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"Breakfast, we mostly eat at Riverside Mill, so I'm naturally partial to that. For lunch, Biergarten in Germany at EPCOT, and Dinner at Liberty Tree Tavern."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,2LargePizzas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:35:51 2015 UTC,breakfast: 1900 park fare for us.  Lots of good history there with some of the employees  Lunch: I love Crystal Palace lunch (although I'm going to biergarten for the first time during me trip in two weeks soooo this may change)  Dinner: (not counting California grill) Ohana's hands down! Give me all of the meats!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Rubyshae,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: The Crystal Palace, a must do every visit. Lunch: We usually just do a snack or quick service for lunch, but I like the Sunshine Seasons Food Court. Dinner: O'Hana and Boma"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Netbug105,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely dinner at the California Grill, it's pricy but that view for Wishes is awesome, plus we usually stay at the Contemporary so we don't have to travel far to get home."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,BravaCentauri,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:25:11 2015 UTC,"Breakfast: Kona Cafe  The coffee is so unbelievably delicious and the Tonga Toast is legendarily amazing. But, even more than all of that, the lobby of the Polynesian has an amazing energy in the morning. It just feels so bright and warm, and everyone's boarding the monorail to head to the park -- it's just the perfect way to start your day.  Lunch: Sci-Fi Dine In Theater  It may not have the best food on the planet, but there is no better midday break on property. Going from the Florida heat into the beautifully recreated summer night is one of the most magical experiences you'll have at DHS. You get to sit in a car! And watch an awesome movie-kinda-reel-thing while you eat! Seriously, it's so fun.  Dinner: California Grill  Amazing food, an amazing view, amazing service. Oh, and your meal ends with fireworks. That's kind of the ultimate trump card."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqh29,Curmudgy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:12:22 2015 UTC,"My curmudgeonly view:  Breakfast: Without kids, breakfast is moot.  Eggs is eggs, oatmeal is oatmeal, and I'll be darned if I'm going to blow my calorie budget on waffles first thing in the morning.  Lunch: Akershus in Norway.  Biased, because being Jewish, I grew up with pickled herring as a staple, but I love the variety here.  A cold lunch is generally in order in FL, and the oddness of the cuisine helps keep the wait down.  Second place: Prime Time Cafe.    Dinner: Hard to pick one, but again for adults with no kids, I'd go with San Angel Inn in Mexico at Epcot for the romantic atmosphere and fine food, though the menu may be limited.  Second place: Hollywood Brown Derby, because of the creative menu.  Fond memories: The Land Grille Room.  The menu changed for the worse right after Kraft stopped sponsorship, and while I'm sure it's changed since then, it just never excited me as much as it did in the earlier days."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,deaddovestore,6,Sat Jul 18 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you're on vacation.  Why stress yourself?  I recently changed a FP in the same location we're going to be so we can enjoy dinner and not feel stressed rushing off to our ride.  I can't imagine having to haul ass to get to another park.  JMO."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,Blubtrflygrl1,2,Sat Jul 18 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"it's not really too stressful. I was planning to spend the morning in MK and then afternoon in Epcot even before I made the fastpass. We're also going to be there for 10 days, so plenty of time to relax. If it was the other way around, lunch before the fastpass, then it might be more stressful, because we wouldn't have time to linger at the restaurant.   We enjoy having a kind of tight schedule; it's part of the fun for us."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,Blubtrflygrl1,2,Sat Jul 18 17:57:41 2015 UTC,Ok to each their own :)
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,Hysterymystery,4,Sat Jul 18 17:58:59 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to change the Biergarten reservation back a little? I haven't done A & E meet and greet before, so I really have no idea how long the wait is with fast pass."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,Hysterymystery,2,Sat Jul 18 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"I could, I just don't want to eat lunch too late because I have Yachtsman's reservations that night. I don't want to not be hungry!   Honestly, those two are not the best fit for the same day, but it was the only way I could work it and I'm not allowed to drop either of them."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,snowwwhite,2,Sat Jul 18 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"If you could give yourself another 20-30 minutes it wouldn't be too much later, but would likely get you to the restaurant on time without worrying about it."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,mkhayes,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:13 2015 UTC,True. I might change it to 1:00.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,deanopeez,4,Sat Jul 18 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"Walk to the Contemporary from Magic Kingdom, take a cab to the Beach Club, enter through International Gateway. It'll cost about 15 dollars, and will eliminate any chances of missing the bus or monorails."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,zipzipzap,2,Sat Jul 18 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. Or Uber."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dr5bu,Solidtrip,2,Sun Jul 19 01:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think the second one is technically quicker, but you'd run the risk of just missing the bus! The safety-first dad in me says the monorail is less risky even if it's more travel time. Either way, I don't think you'll make it in 20 minutes, but it's an exciting challenge!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,zombeymonkie,5,Sat Jul 18 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"Not a honeymooner, but the resort we are staying at (Port Orleans Riverside) has horse and carriage rides.  I'm also personally looking forward to dinner at Be Our Guest....Beauty & the Beast is probably my favorite Disney movie."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,Blubtrflygrl1,3,Sat Jul 18 18:01:23 2015 UTC,My family has stayed at French Quarter before and loved it.  I will definitely look into the carriage rides.  I have not been to Disney since Be Our Guest opened so I will have to check that out as well. Thanks!
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,Blubtrflygrl1,4,Sat Jul 18 18:42:04 2015 UTC,You may have to stalk the site for a reservation time.  Learned that from here :)
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,scholargeek13,4,Sat Jul 18 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"At check in (or when you book your trip, either works), let them know it's your honeymoon so they'll give you Just Married buttons to wear around.  At the least you'll get a lot of congratulations, but I've heard of a lot of people getting special perks (like getting to go into the fast pass line instead of standby!) randomly.  It's up to the cast members on duty, really.  Purchase the bride and groom Mickey ears and have them embroidered with your names! They're awesome keepsakes.  We stayed at Coronado Springs and they also gave us a voucher for free champagne!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,Spruce_Wayne,3,Sat Jul 18 18:29:48 2015 UTC,We called it in before our honeymoon and our room at the contemporary was upgraded. We also got extra dessert at just about every meal. Soooo much food.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,DiscoveryZone,2,Sat Jul 18 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"Our ""Just Engaged"" buttons earned my fiancee and I a private safari!"
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,DiscoveryZone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:02 2015 UTC,No way! That's amazing. My fiancee would love that.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,deaddovestore,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend getting the pins and wearing them everywhere on property, haha."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,anyquestions,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:27:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! My mom actually went out and bought the bride and groom ears as soon as I told her I was proposing.  I'll have to get them embroidered while we are down there.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,Random1010100,3,Sat Jul 18 18:45:32 2015 UTC,Tours- check out the Wild Africa Trek!!! Especially if she loves animals. I'm going to be doing it on my honeymoon this September and I've only read amazing reviews about it.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,PrimrosePlath,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:11 2015 UTC,Sounds great! I will look into that.
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,IRSeb,2,Sat Jul 18 23:24:37 2015 UTC,"If she's into animals and you can afford it, it will be the highlight of your trip, guaranteed. I've done it and really can't recommend it highly enough."
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,starkravingjoyful,2,Sun Jul 19 05:16:54 2015 UTC,Me and my wife did the same thing at the same age. Call the hotel and let them know it is your honeymoon along with any restaurants you go to. Disney always adds something special when they know about it. The married bride and groom hats were awesome to keep as souvenirs. While i didnt wear mine to much my wife treasures them to this day. Other then that.... we didnt really plan anything.. Did what we wanted when we wanted. With that said i did make reservations to the popular restaurants every other night so we could hit the popular ones to include victoria and alberts. We had the full dining plan as well and after the third day we were so full we stopped eating appetizers and bread and taking most the meals back to our rooms. hhmm i cant think of much after that... any other questions just shoot me a message..:)
WaltDisneyWorld,3dqw7c,chrisd37,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't think about letting the restaurants know it was our honeymoon in advance.  My mom already bought us the bride and groom ears.  We'll definitely wear those at least one day. I know July is going to be very crowded so I also plan to try and go with the flow as much as possible and not worry about schedules too much."
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,hitch450,2,Sat Jul 18 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"What I would do:   Go to breakfast (since BoG breakfast isn't on the TIW list of discounts anyway) Once you have a lull in your MK day, and before you do any of your shopping, head up front to the ticketing windows and do your upgrade to APs Then, go to guest relations to buy TIW."
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,dawnrevolution,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   Stupid question here but are there ticket windows in MK? Like right outside? Or do I have to go back to the TTC? I'm having a brain fart and can't remember exactly.   And I can but tables in wonderland at guest relations after I have my AP but I can't buy my AP there, correct? Just wanna make sure I have this right."
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,dawnrevolution,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"I believe MK's ticketing windows are all at the TTC (which I forgot when writing my original comment, sorry), but guest relations should also be able to do your upgrade if you don't want to run all the way over there. At least according to this, anyway: https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/guest-relations/"
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,PsychoCelloChica,2,Sat Jul 18 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"There are ticket windows to the right of the park entrance, no need to go over to the TTC. We added days to our tickets using them in January."

WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,showtonight,2,Sun Jul 19 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Tables in Wonderland can only be processed by Guest Relations, and the resorts cannot handle an annual pass upgrade."
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,SenjiDogMom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:46:25 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the resorts could do the upgrade. Thanks for the heads up!
WaltDisneyWorld,3drrhk,sil3nt8o8,2,Sat Jul 18 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can get your pass and your TiW card at the Magic Kingdom front gates.  We did both at Epcot ticket windows 2 years ago, and there are definitely ticket windows and guest relations at Magic Kingdom."
