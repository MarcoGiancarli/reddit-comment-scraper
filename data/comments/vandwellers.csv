I am working on a graphic design degree so hopefully I'll be able to freelance or work remotely.  I have been doing a ton of research and stumbled upon this.  https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&client=ms-android-att-us&source=android-browser&q=workamping  That's just the Google search. It's called workamping. It seems like a ton of people do it. Basically you get hired on at state parks/campgrounds during peak seasons (or even off season!). You work for a few months, opening gates, cleaning grounds, etc. Most of the time you get a free spot to park while you are working there so you can live on the grounds where you work. It comes with free hookups too. Sometimes they will take the first 10 hrs you've worked or some thing similar and put that towards the price of your plot while you are working there."

I forgot the word for it, but it's designed for people who only want to work here and there. Usually they only hire during black friday, Christmas, etc, and I believe you are sorting packages. It's back breaking work, and you are working like 12 hrs a day for 3 months, but from what I have read a lot of people make enough money there to sustain themselves for the rest of the year or the majority of it as long as they are smart with spending.

vandwellers,3e2n2v,cookieguy10,12,Tue Jul 21 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"I lived about 9 - 10 years in a house with my parents before they got into a bad argument and split. Went with mom and after that I have spent about 18-19 years renting. It has been a wide range from renting a room in someone's house to renting a condo to renting an apt then to renting an apt and renting out a room in the apt and finally renting a condo and renting part of the living space in the condo. So for quite a while I have had 'roomates' to live with. All in all what I have noticed is that the first few months things go well. Then after that usually little quirks kick in. Things that annoy people between you doing something they don't like or they doing something you don't like. All in all I've had to switch places about every 4 months or so and I honestly think I am an easy person to live with. I don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs. Don't like loud music. ALWAYS pay rent on time, don't party, etc. For whatever reason things just wouldn't work out and I'd move on. When I was renting out a room in my apt or a space in my condo there would always be something that was an issue, always. From people partying, drinking, smoking, loud music, loud tv, loud behaviour, it has been pretty tough. I only rented out for about 3 years of that whole time I mentioned. It is pretty darn tough to rent out to people you don't know. About every month or so I'd have to look for someone else because the person would leave. Granted I was renting to 2 roomates instead of one, sometimes someone would stay a bit longer for about 3-4 months and those were the quiet people who caused almost no issues. I'd feel bad when there was another person who would  be the loud one or issue related one and it made living tough. After that I moved into an rv. Then rv + commute car combo. Then a full size van, and now I am inside a nissan leaf. I don't want to go back to that old renting out life style it is pretty bad and I did not even mention the neighbors. If I can I'd like to live out of a vehicle for the rest of my life. I feel free and almost trouble free. Life is good."

Yes, Im paying taxes, but that's far less than the cost of an apartment (even at $200/month).  You also shouldn't need to have temporary living in the winter. You just need to insulate your van well"
vandwellers,3e2n2v,realy,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:43 2015 UTC,"You're a total baller.  The one thing I worry about is that if I can cut my possessions down to a very small amount, like a car-load, than would the van be limiting liberation because of the much-higher MPG?   I could get a Honda with 40 mpg and only get cheapo rooms in places, and would probably be more likely to go on trips with 1/3rd the gas cost.  I don't know, totally on the fence here. Mind describing how a van would be more liberating than owning few possessions and being able to pack everything into your car?  Is it just because I live in a cheap city, and if I lived in a more expensive place, the costs would be a no-brainer?"
vandwellers,3e2n2v,CJ-Johnson,7,Tue Jul 21 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on living in a van being liberating.  Your concerns are totally valid.  I doubt I could do it, i'm just here to vicariously read about experience others have.  I think it really takes a certain type of person to pull off living in a van well.  You need to have good mental fortitude, street smarts and charisma would come in handy.    A lot of it depends on the area where you choose to live and your living arrangements.  If you have a safe place to park where no one will bother you I think you'll do ok if you can handle being in a small space.  If you have to constantly be on the move to stay unnoticed then I think it can be very tiring and stressful.  There are very little boundaries (and insulation, both sound and environmental) when you're living in a vehicle.  Anyone can walk up to your vehicle, making noise or just normal traffic rolling by. Police welfare checks can be common It would seem difficult to sleep soundly."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,koanhead,5,Tue Jul 21 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"Consider that many live in a van as a way out of working a mind-numbing day job or to focus on passions like writing, rock climbing or just travel.  It's not difficult to save up enough to live off of if all you have to pay for is a van and food. You'd work a month out of the year, as long as you don't exhaust your safety net.  This is assuming you don't have debts or child support to pay back."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,matrixdutch,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"You would be hard pressed to shove enough things into the van such that it would reduce your milage. But even if you managed to achieve that, you're still spending a lot less money on gas + insurance + repairs than you ever would on rent. There's simply no way that the math works in favor of renting (unless you step up to something like an RV -- in that case it can get quite expensive)  But, to address your concerns specifically (I share them) I'm in the market for a Chevy Volt.   It makes a surprisingly good camper and being that it's small, it reeeealy forces you to cut down. You can store clothes, toiletries, legal documentation, a laptop (or phone or whatever) and that's about it. Pretty much everything has to make room for the bedding. I plan on buying a mattress from Ikea instead of using a sleeping bag like that link, though. Should be more comfortable."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,BaywardBoondocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"For most people the costs of a van far outweigh rent.  Especially if you consider that many people don't have the upfront money to buy a van and would need to take out a car loan to get one.  Car loan + insurance + gas + maintenance will easily add up to over what rent costs in some areas. Plus you are guaranteed to spend more eating out when you don't have a kitchen. I pay $600 for rent including cable and all utilities.  The car payment alone on a 2015 Chevy Volt is more than $600 a month even if you get a five year loan.  If you have a paid off car already, it is pretty hard to make van living add up to savings.  Unless you live in a very expensive city rent-wise."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,Ljppkgfgs,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:36 2015 UTC,"Why would you buy a brand new volt? Im talking 2011 or 2012....  And that last sentence doesn't even make sense. If you have a paid off car already, it makes even more sense to live in it."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,elf25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"For most people the costs of a van far outweigh rent.   This statement doesn't make sense without more detail. Yes, buying and outfitting a brand-new van is more expensive than living in a cheap apartment, until the van is paid for. The apartment will never be paid off, unless you buy it outright- which is going to be more expensive than buying any but the fanciest of vans.  There are a lot of variables, and there's no case that applies equally to ""most people"" because peoples' needs, resources and proclivities are different. When I lived in a van it was much, much cheaper than living in a rented space, but I bought the van for $300 and did all my own mechanicking on it. ($300 vans typically take some fixing ☺) Others without my advantages will have a much harder time; others with advantages I lack would have an easier time."
vandwellers,3e2n2v,Solarnynja,2,Tue Jul 21 22:52:45 2015 UTC,Let's just say that an apartment shared bathroom with your own room could be 200-300 per month in your area    I don't like rooming with people I live in the Northeast and a room costs around $800 to rent

Homeless people have some low key but upscale places to park that are safe and hassle free if they keep a low profile.

(And yes, his name is actually Kreimer.) The Post recently caught up with him in Penn Station, where he spends most of his time smelling bad and daring cops to eject him so he can file another lawsuit. Hey, it's a living.  Kreimer readily admits that litigation is his ""profession,"" and told the Times five years ago, ""All Americans have dollar signs in their eyes. I'm an honest person and I sue to get monetary claims. But also for social justice."" (It's a great read.) Kreimer's career was launched two decades ago when he won $230,000 in a settlement after being kicked out of a Morristown, NJ, library for his body odor. Since then, whenever he gets low on funds, he stops bathing and starts loitering, targeting small municipalities who would rather settle than pay for years of litigation. Kreimer also targets the bigger fish, hiring attorneys to go after CVS, a rich New Jersey doctor, and, up next, NJ Transit.   http://gothamist.com/2010/05/31/millionaire_bum_suing_again_over_ho.php"

vandwellers,3e0jj6,Minivan2016,7,Tue Jul 21 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"The fact that they are amending it makes me think that it might pass, but I’m not sure how much easier it will make things for me here in San Francisco. With the population density and competition for space here, you need wizard skills to park at all, much less for dwelling. In SF proper, any place that is safe and quiet with space available is also going to be wealthy, and I have been dealing with private security more so than cops. On multiple occasions I’ve experienced cars pulling up behind me, flashing their lights in my vehicle and playing very loud music or otherwise making loud noise after I pull in for the night, and I’m guessing that nothing in this bill will put a stop to that, unless I want to confront these folks and stand my ground in the dead of night, or sue them for harassment, which I don’t.   There are also great residential spots here that are legal but require permits 24-7, rather than just for daytime hours, so I imagine we may see more of that. If this passes, at least I’ll feel more secure about not getting towed, impounded, or arrested, but there’s nothing stopping anyone from rousting you in the dead of night for a “welfare check,” or asking where the litter underneath your car came from. I think that the cops here are fairly understanding about dwelling, since we’ve had hippies living in vans for a couple of generations, but they could probably still jam you up if they wanted to. The one cop who contacted me was decent, but he had his canine with him, and his suggestion that I move to the SF marina, where a woman was shot in broad daylight last week, was less than helpful. Between LE and the dead serious private security out here, I’m more on edge about dwelling than usual.    Owners of prime real estate do not want dwellers around their homes, plain and simple, and to tell the truth, I can relate. If I owned a beach house, I wouldn't want campers all up and down my street; I’m trying to boost my stealth and not disturb anybody’s peace. But I have little choice because I'm starting over financially and the housing market here is a dystopian nightmare. Some family homes are beginning to sell for almost a million dollars over the asking price, and the rental market is a commensurate disaster.  The job market is great, though, so I’m looking at a few more months of cat-and-mouse before I can plan my next steps and move forward. I hope that this passes and maybe backs a little of the heat off, because I feel like I’m spotting more of us out and about. Someone posted that a similar law was great for dwellers in L.A., so we shall see."

In one of the supporting documents of the bill, there was a concern that this bill would allow people to not have to move around and maybe that's why the provisions say must adhere to local ordinances.   So its like a safeguard against the idiots that don't move around.  Let's get this pass already :-)"

vandwellers,3e1403,crockett5,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"Just know, that some Sunday nights, this really big car club goes there and pretty much takes up the entire parking lot. I haven't figured out their schedule yet, but seems like maybe every other Sunday.  They start showing up about 8 or 9pm and then leave around 11pm. Lots of car stereo boom boom noise and rice burner engines revs for about 2 hours then they go away.  When I say big car club it's well over 100 cars plus people whom look at them. People even set up little vending tents, so it's kinda a big ordeal I guess.  Other than that's it's a good location, as long as you are ok with a bit of traffic noise (parking lots are next to 70). There are also cops whom patrol the lot pretty often and they are very much aware people are long term overnighting there. They don't seem to care.  I've been staying there for about 3 weeks on my days off because there is always a nice breeze and it's much cooler there than down in town.    If you are into mountain biking it's also a great location because you can hit the red rock trials to the south, Apex mountain to the north or the dinosaur ridge trails across 93. All are a easy ride or a very quick drive away.  In fact I'm about to go hike the dinosaur ridge trail today, because I haven't checked it out yet."

vandwellers,3e0mpy,speadbrite,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"The $2000 of new parts underscores that a lot of stuff on this van is wearing out and may need to be replaced.  Your best bet is to minimize the additional miles that you put on the van.  There may be a big unfixed problem with the van that forced the seller to sell.  Make sure that there are no rain water (say around windows) or plumbing leaks.  An apartment has a fixed monthly expense that you can plan for in your budget.  You know whether you can afford an apartment.  An old van has unpredictable expenses, so you need to build up a large reserve fund.  How large?  As large as possible.  The usual bad outcome happens when a person invests their entire savings in an old van and then fails to accumulate a large enough reserve fund before they have a substantial repair bill.  A broken down van is worth very little and very few people will buy it.  So then the person sells the broken down van for 1/10th of what they paid for it and loses their life-savings.  So the way to win with a van like this is to have a reserve fund BEFORE you buy it and it helps to have a job so that the reserve fund grows before you have to start spending it.  Make sure that the van is not rusted out or in need of a major repair.  Buy it and start making repairs.  Keep pouring money into it, maybe 2-3X the purchase price over time.  Everything that you fix is unlikely to break a second time, so eventually the repairs taper off.  Then you hold onto the van for forever and your reserve fund gets bigger and bigger.  You will not be able to sell the van for the amount that you have invested in it.   The in-between-way to lose with a van like this is to buy it, put $1000 into it, then sell it for what you paid for it.  If you don't have a job/income or the discipline to a accumulate a ever-growing reserve fund, then you will lose with this van."
vandwellers,3e0mpy,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:41 2015 UTC,Seems like a decent price for one of those if it's in good shape.

The guy took really good care of it and from what I have kraken these things can go pretty far if well maintained. I'd have a mechanic do an inspection of it. These do seem to need a new transmission by 150000 or so, so ask about that (I'd bet that was part of that $2k). And check for rust. I got mine for $4k.  Mine has the same roof and is the extended 19 footer (looks like this one is too) and I get about 13-15 MPG. There are a few different engine types, so that will vary.

I would have always liked to just throw endless money at the project and have a ton of neat stuff. But to limit it to what we did... I'd say I'd would have made a bunch of tiny holders for stuff. Like spice rack, toothbrush holders, pantry, and just overall have more access to stuff. We have 6 large Rubbermaid bins underneath our kitchen counter and they hold all of our stuff. It's annoying to always have to dig for something. When we take a break from traveling I'll add those things in. I also wish we had a kitchen sink. Doing dishes standing up over the shower drain sucks. We'll put one of those in soon. We left all the plumbing in so it'll be easy to pop one in. We haven't even too worried about how we built it because our number one goal was to make it happen since these things can easily get out of hand and overwhe/never happen. We built it with the intention of living in it, figuring out what works best and then tailoring it to what we learned from our mistakes. Awesome question... Got me pondering"

I, myself, have considered if utilizing both a huge cooler with a drain for a shower, which would also pull other duties like a bench seat, plus, keeping another smaller insulated cooler on the inside to further keep perishables colder longer.  Could just throw your solar bag on dash to heat up, take out smaller cooler, string up a curtain, shower, then drain.  This also takes into consideration where you are camped.  Can't really empty a shower in cities if you're stealth camping.  So many variables..   still thinking on them myself.  Wish you luck!!"

vandwellers,3dvfec,geo38,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"My only problem with that material is, I find it begins to take an odor almost right away, and becomes very strong within the day. It's great if you are doing outdoor tasks where that doesn't matter, but at the end of that day it's terrible even in the laundry.  I am getting down to just a few shirts that are merino wool base layers, quite thin. This material doesn't seem to take an odor even after a week of indoor wear, or several days of moderate outdoor use such as summertime walking tours. It washes in a sink of woolite with very little care - just don't wring it out, blot it with a towel and let it air dry.   Since the material is so thin, it doesn't take rough handling at all well. So if I am carrying something against my chest or doing anything that will stress the fabric, I simply wear another layer over it. A simple cotton sweater, t-shirt, long sleeve shirt, or jacket is more than enough. A base layer fit merino shirt should fit snugly and not move around underneath, and it keeps you cool in the summer (wicking) and warm in the winter (trapped air). I haven't tried it under those plastic-feeling shirts you mention, but I guess it will keep them from getting odorous also."
vandwellers,3dvfec,geo38,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, odor can be an issue. If they smell shortly after putting them on, it's likely they weren't washed well. The fibers of these materials have very rough surfaces at the microscopic level which is what makes them awesome for wicking away moisture. Unfortunately, these make great homes for bacteria.  Google solutions - wash with vinegar, vinegar and salt, etc. I use ""Tide Sport with Fabreze"" detergent which seems to work.  Never use fabric softener. The chemicals end up coating the fibers which makes them smooth and soft but they no longer wick moisture."
vandwellers,3dvfec,geo38,0,Sun Jul 19 22:55:39 2015 UTC,Vinegar? No shit? Thats funny! I thought I was going crazy but I could swear they smelled like vinegar when I bought them.

vandwellers,3dqhsx,Chizbang,6,Sat Jul 18 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"https://www.privateinternetaccess.com It's $39.95 per year or $3.33 a month, pretty cheap. Their client is pretty solid and I've yet to experience slow speeds with any of their US servers. The desktop client is pretty nice, also features a VPN killswitch so no unencrypted data can leak. Also if you check out /r/fullmoviesonyoutube a lot of them are region locked so it's nice to be able to just switch out to a region where the video still works."

vandwellers,3dqhsx,Minivan2016,2,Sat Jul 18 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"Never ever ever ever ever ever ever use Hola, its highly dangerous.  Hola is based off of peer to peer technology which means everyones traffic is passed to each other... Meaning if someone is performing a highly illegal activity is on Hola, you could be processing some of that traffic and be held responsible as a result.  https://www.privateinternetaccess.com  is simply unbeatable when it comes to value, speed and compatibility.

I think their servers (at least in the US) are capable of delivering a much faster speed than AT&T can do with mobile, so really the limit just sits with LTE. That doesn't surprise me much though because a lot of cable internet users take advantage of VPN and cable internet can provide quicker upload and download rates. I suspect someone using cable or google fiber could detect a noticeable decrease in speed, not so much on mobile."

vandwellers,3dqhsx,Rusty4x4,3,Sat Jul 18 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"We lived off grid for a year. I had a jet pack from ATT. I found that the cheapest solution was to start high and back down until you get used to how much data you are actually using. I wasn't working at the time, was recovering from a medical procedure for about four months of it, and I could watch maybe an hour of netflix a day (or two) and I think I started at 70Gb?   If you start at like 50 and go over, you can always go in and have them up your plan and they will prorate it to get rid of your overages.  Our bigger challenge was that we didn't have enough solar to cover the LCD tv on the overcast days. Good luck!"
vandwellers,3dqhsx,AmbienDreams,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"I was limited to 5gb a month for a while and it actually wasn't that bad, coming from a complete internet addict.

I'd get dropped calls all the time, and trying to get anything done online was a chore. I stuck with Verizon for 2 years under those shitty conditions, tried out 3 different phones too.   Jumped ship to Tmobile. Coverage has been perfect in the cities, and also back out in the suburbs too. Tmobile also crushed my previous download speed record that I had gotten with Verizon. The fastest speed test on Verizon in all my years with them topped out at something like 32Mbps, Tmobile so far has topped out at 45Mbps."

vandwellers,3dqr0m,Alexanderr,2,Sun Jul 19 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"I have been looking into a USA/ Canada plan also. Only issue I see with your idea is I heard T Mobile has bad coverage unless your staying in urban areas, so.....even if its a good deal in price, the coverage from ATT or Verision is much much better at a higher price."
vandwellers,3dqr0m,Lsrtravel,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"I can confirm your fears about coverage.    I've been a T-Mobile subscriber/supporter for probably 12 years, since they were very open to the first generation of smart phones (pre-iphone) in that time I've used dozens of devices on their network throughout northern and southern California, in the SW in Nevada, Arizona, NM, Colorado and into the Midwest with extensive usage in Western Nebraska and as far East as Ames in Iowa. (Also, N/S Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, Washington, Oregon, Arkansas, Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia...) I'd say I've fairly well canvassed the Western United states if some areas only briefly.    The verdict: It works pretty well in Sacramento.    The GSM wavelengths don't have great penetration so coverage in San Francisco and other large cities is spotty. Coverage outside of those cities is a deadzone even in densely populated areas of California. I drove  between Denver and Ames before the 4th of July weekend and the only coverage I got between the two was Omaha and a few blips passing through Lincoln. Likewise, I did San Francisco to Las Vegas last weekend and had an 8 hour deadzone between.    The coverage is unworkable, not just data coverage but phone coverage as well, for two whole weeks this month while on the road I couldn't make or receive calls (on T-Mobile). In addition, T-Mobile as a company has gone from being an innovative company with great customer service who early on embraced smart phones, tethering and unlocking to just another shitty telecom company. I've been carrying the same phone on both T-Mobile and Verizon for the past three months and although I'm typing this in the T-Mobile phone (on WiFi) I definitely rely on the Verizon phone for everything but Reddit.    (P.S. I hate Verizon as a company, but I need coverage when I travel. I'm cancelling T-Mobile ASAP.)  [Edit: It did work, without intntl charges from Tijuana but not further South in Ensenata.]"

I'll probably get this unlimited plan so I can do all that stuff and stockpile porn when I do find high speed.   Also, the app OpenSignal is amazing. Just discovered it yesterday.

Perhaps the T-Mobile deal would be ok, if you were using it on a tablet of some sort, but the 7 gig data limit on tethering makes it pretty useless IMO.   The only thing I could maybe think of as a use for unlimited data, is if you piped Netflix from the phone to a TV. Then you could have unlimited TV streaming at least."

vandwellers,3dmlq7,One_Awesome_Inch,3,Fri Jul 17 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you've got about a $900 budget for this ($300 rent for 3 months). For that money you've got a lot of options for improving your setup that don't involve getting out of the van.  If you're waking up cold in a sleeping bag, you've got the wrong bag. Maybe try one rated for your weather. If you're out of the wind those -32C rated bags will have you poached in your own body heat by morning. Be sure you have an insulated pad under you too.  You could also put an electric heating blanket or mattress pad in the sleeping bag with you (I'd use a quality 120V version running on an inverter, the 12V models seem to be low quality). That will easily run all night on an aux battery, and is a much more energy efficient way to keep warm at night than a propane heater.  A heat exchange ventilator ($about 350) might help, assuming your van is insulated and you can spare a little space. You can also make one if you are handy.  If your van isn't insulated though, you'll probably be loosing heat too fast to make a heat exchanger worth the space. I'd start with an appropriate sleeping bag and pad, then add a heating blanket. That should get you through a -50C night pretty easily."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,omapuppet,3,Fri Jul 17 16:00:35 2015 UTC,Thought about renting space in an RV park for the winter?
vandwellers,3dmlq7,savax7,2,Fri Jul 17 22:51:59 2015 UTC,The other thing you could do is place an ad on craigslist for the arrangement you are looking for. Most people in your area would never think someone would live like you do so they may never post an ad but may respond to yours.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,Bouncer827,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:06 2015 UTC,I do intend to try doing that as well. Run multiple ads starting in November.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,digital_bum,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"Hey. These are a really good alternative to the Webasto and Dometic Eberspacher  I've used aliexpress for a few years and their system favours buyer protections. These are the same as what is sold on ebay but 3/5ths the price.  One word of warning. A diesel heater uses a few amps on startup for the glow plugs and requires a steady current for the blower fan, personally I would add 60w of solar to cover the overhead.  A 2Kw diesel Dometic Eberspacher heater should heat any van no problem."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,robshookphoto,2,Fri Jul 17 22:00:41 2015 UTC,Your space is tiny. A wood stove running off of kindling would be plenty to bake you. Diesel would work too but it's expensive.   Propane isn't a great idea because of moisture.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,robshookphoto,2,Fri Jul 17 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% urban vandwelling as I need to be close to work and to see my kids. Smoke from a chimney wont be well percieved and will get cops and Fire Dept on my butt in no time.  The moisture of propane is a big concern of mine. From what I recall my heater on the low setting of 1600BTUS will produce 2 ounces of moisture per hour. My idea is to have a computer fan (with a vent behind the rear license plate) sucking the air/moisture out. However, then its also sucking the heat out. Thus, I have to find the right balance and I won't know how it all shakes out until it gets colder. and I actually do it."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,matrixdutch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:28:10 2015 UTC,"You could consider a diesel one. No smoke, dry heat. They're pricey though."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,crockett5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:23 2015 UTC,Yes.  Webasto and Espar heaters cost a lot.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,Bouncer827,2,Fri Jul 17 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"I could also get a Dickinson Marine Newport P9000, which is a vented propane heater. However, at close to $900cdn its a substantial investment. Plus on its lowest setting its 3200BTUS which is a problem for two reason. 1. It would double the cost of my propane since my current heater is 1600BTUS. 2. My interior of my van is very small (standard cargo van with a solid partition wall behind front seats) and is very well insulated with 2 inch rigid foam board insulation in the walls and ceiling. This means I will often have to get up and turn the heater off since I have no thermostat. I went nuts on the insulation so I could save on heating costs and stick with 1600BTUS. The 3200BTUS may bake me out.  Again I wont really know til the weather gets cold. I just like to think about all my options and possibilites and bounce ideas off you guys to get your opinions.  Either way, I refuse to freeze and ultimately I will do whatever it takes to avoid it. The good thing is its only 3 or so months I have to contend with."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,yarrpirates,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:39 2015 UTC,Why not try to find a furnace out of an old RV? If I knew I'd be in cold climates half the year I go with an rv style furnace.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,axf7228,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:47:50 2015 UTC,"That is an option. However they do tend to be large (not much room left in the van) loud, and take up electricity. I would probably go with the Dickinson Newport P9000 first."
vandwellers,3dmlq7,Road_Money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:30:29 2015 UTC,I would look into a very good cold weather bag for sleeping and wake up 5 minutes earlier than usual turn on the heat and warm your space before getting out of the sleeping bag. It's tough living like this in northern winters. I did it many years ago without heat in New England the cold and a mold issue drove me out of my truck.
vandwellers,3dmlq7,Persona_Transplant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"I will likely try this. Jump out of bed 10 min early, crank the heater to high, go back under the covers."

vandwellers,3dif1q,_Phreedom,11,Thu Jul 16 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"Reflective foil as discussed in the video is mostly aluminum foil. It is extremely conductive and an air gap is therefore required.  Reflectix is mylar bubble wrap with a very thin coating of aluminum. It is NOT very conductive of heat. It does reflect heat that is radiated by a hot surface (like the metal roof of a van). It does not require an air gap to be effective.  Reflectix has ZERO vapor permeability and Foil Insulation has extremely low vapor permeability. The tiny visible holes in Foil Insulation are intended to give it some vapor permeability. BOTH materials will trap moisture. For this reason, use only ONE layer of Reflectix and put it next to the metal skin of the van. A second layer (of either material) on the inside surface of the foam will trap moisture and lead to mold problems.   Putting wood furring strips between the metal skin of the van and either reflective material is a bad idea because the foil will trap moisture and the mold/mildew will eat the wood. Water/moisture WILL get into this cavity eventually. If you omit the wood furring strips, there will be nothing for the mold to eat.  Use foam and finish surfaces that are vapor permeable so that the wall can dry out in the daily wet/dry cycle. In general, all walls need to be able to dry to at least one side (vapor permeable). In a metal skinned van that means that the wall needs to dry to the inside of the van and the inside of the van needs to be ventilated. Using anything in a wall that is not vapor-permeable (including finish materials like polyurethane paint) will cause problems. The exception to this would be Reflectix glued to the sheet metal. Foil insulation is not a good material in vans. If it is glued to the metal skin it will conduct heat and be useless. Use Reflectix. Use blueboard NOT polyurethane foam sheets (not vapor permeable).

I think reflectix comes in many different varieties, including one with a bubble layer: Reflectix FAQ  Does that mean it doesn't need air space?  I'm very interested to work out the best way to insulate a promaster van while maximizing interior space.   I'm thinking at the moment that I will do the following in order of outside-in: * Van Wall * 25% coverage butyl-backed sound deader (is flashing the same thing?) * glued-in alu bubble wrap stuff * lambs wool (to fill gaps) * 1/2 inch foam insulation (permeable/breathable - which one?) * thin ecoply (for the nice wood-grain look).  I want to minimize harmful fumes and allow the walls to breath so that they may dry out after condensation occurs (to prevent mold).  Does this sound like a good game plan?  Insulation seems to be the most difficult topic to tackle to find an absolute best practice as there seems to be 100's of different approaches. Surely there has to be a best-practice, right?"
vandwellers,3dif1q,fortyhands,2,Fri Jul 17 02:56:45 2015 UTC,"I think reflectix comes in many different varieties, including one with a bubble layer: Reflectix FAQ   This is perhaps the source of the confusion about the air space.  The bubbled variety has two reflective layers and the bubbles provide the 'air gap' for the inner layer.   Whereas the woven form needs furring strips and a deliberate 'air gap'.    http://www.lowes.com/pd_15348-46086-201549_0__?productId=3014183 is vapor permeable  Lambs wool probably will be food for mold if it gets damp.  Not good.  Use spray closed cell foam to fill gaps and trim with a sharpened putty knife.  Ecoply is a temporary (90 day) building cladding and as such I suspect that it is not vapor permeable (it will not breath) so it would be a poor choice for interior surface.  Check the spec on this to be sure.  Interior finish material is difficult to get right.  One sure fire approach is to use slats of material with small air gaps between the slats.  You can put a thin vapor permeable material like cloth or some types of paper (or building wrap like Typar) under the slats for visual effect if you're picky about that.  The slats themselves do not need to be vapor permeable.  The water vapor comes out between the slats.  You could rip slats of ecoply on a table saw, say 2"" wide.   butyl-backed sound deader   This will be marginally effective at low frequencies even with very high % area coverage.  Butyl tends to outgas VOCs.  If the material has a detectable smell, don't use it.  I would omit.  You really can't soundproof a van very well.  The basic thing to understand is that the wall will tend to absorb moisture at night when you're sleeping/cooking in the van and then dry out during the day when it is not occupied.  Thus it is important to ventilate around the clock.  Put your fan on a timer and run it periodically.  At night ventilation will minimize wetting and during the day maximize drying.   High end RVs use something like this http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-FV-04VE1-WhisperComfortTM-Ventilation-Patent-Pending/dp/B000XJNZ1Y/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437104341&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=rv+air+exchange+ventilator  There is a lot of 'oral tradition' that muddies 'best practices'.  I've a background with the practices espoused on buildingscience.com The same physics apply to vans.  Vans are harder because of the metal skin, default poor ventilation, small interior space and lots of moisture from breathing/cooking humans sleeping inside and trying to stay warm.  The key is to dry out during the day and avoid materials (like wood and paper and possibly lambs wool) that support mold growth when damp.  Also dry out clothes, blankets, mattresses in the sun during the day when possible.  When I camp, I dry out towels and dirty clothes in the sun before putting in the laundry bag.  Some people are less picky about van smell BO."

vandwellers,3dgwf2,Lsrtravel,2,Thu Jul 16 04:26:07 2015 UTC,I've noticed pretty good service with at&t in both countries. Haven't gone into the boonies of Canada much but I've noticed at&t has improved a lot the past couple years. Can't say much about Verizon because I haven't had them in about 8 years or so but never had any issues when I did. Try looking up a coverage map for the areas you plan on being in.
vandwellers,3dgwf2,djxnt,2,Thu Jul 16 04:55:18 2015 UTC,"Verizon is pretty much #1 when it comes to coverage, but also #1 when it comes to most hassle. Overall, I think T-mobile is the least hassle, but their coverage is abysmal."

vandwellers,3dgwf2,bicyclehobo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"And that's exactly why it's abysmal. They cater to large metro areas right now, and in the end that may be their downfall. I live in a pretty urban area (110,000 pops) and their coverage is good in maybe one section of town, and the rest barely see 2mbps speeds, and more often it's less than 1mbps speeds. Coverage isn't horrible, but you can tell how bad it is just by driving around town.  I just refuse to go to Verizon because of their business practices."
vandwellers,3dgwf2,kyonu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:33 2015 UTC,In the states Verizon tends to lead in coverage. They just opened up their towers to 3rd party vendors now. Look into page plus. Verizon service for a fraction of the cost and its month to month. I've been using them for a few months now and am very happy with the service (switched over from Sprint)
vandwellers,3dgwf2,zeppobob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:36:24 2015 UTC,"I'd do AT&T over verizon, and I'm on Verizon right now. I got it thinking ""yeah I make decent money, I want to go ahead and get the best coverage I can get"", but it was a mistake. Even where I am in the capital of my state (Raleigh, NC) service is spotty and just isn't everywhere like I thought it would be. I wish I hadn't signed the contract, if I could do it again I'd do Cricket, with is a month-by-month service using at&t towers. My friend has tried tons of different providers and worked for a few of them, now he's settled on Cricket and gets 20 gigs a month of data plus unlimited call and texts for 60 a month. You just have to provide your own phone.   that 20 gig a month deal was a special offer, I should mention. You're not gonna find it now. but something similar may come up later."

vandwellers,3de9wv,euhuguenin,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:21 2015 UTC,With the laptop a non pure sine wave is not required because you are only charging the laptop battery and not running the unit off of it. Now if you wanted to run a PC then you would need the works.

Search for ""inverter"" on amazon, and read the reviews.  As the other posters have said, run the LED lights and fan directly off the batteries -- not through the inverter.  The inverter will simply convert DC to AC (at around 83% efficiency).  Hell, if you're just charging a laptop, you might be able to buy a DC charger for that, and skip the inverter entirely."
vandwellers,3de9wv,Bouncer827,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:37:38 2015 UTC,The fan and led lights can run right off of 12v from the battery. for the laptop it depends you may need a pure sine wave but I would think 1000 watts continuous would do the trick just fine.
vandwellers,3de9wv,warm_n_toasty,3,Wed Jul 15 17:38:16 2015 UTC,1000 watts is pretty overkill for just running a laptop. I dont know about others but the most powerful mac charger is only 85 watts. 1000watt pure inverters are crazy expensive as well.

I even set up a curtain system inside that should allow me to shower with it in urban places."

vandwellers,3d9nz5,buckfunter,18,Tue Jul 14 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"So my wife and I are currently living in a house and at the end of the month will have transitioned to living in this van. We thought it'd be wise to have test runs so we know what we would need to add/change.  We decided to drive to the beach with the romanticized idea that it would be this amazing experience where we would wake up with the beach at our footsteps. After about 30 minutes of traffic lights reflecting inside the van and drunk people walking home, we decided to find somewhere with less light and a lot less people (we're in California for reference).   We found a spot in an industrial area that was great. My wife was a little scared but we managed to get some sleep until around 3.00am, when a car pulled up behind us with it's highbeams on. I froze, trying not to shit my pants in fear. I soon realized that the scary figure pulled up behind us was just another dude looking to sleep somewhere quiet for the night. We drove home and parked in our driveway and slept the rest of the night in the car.   Things we had problems with:   Light, and not being able to use it inside.  My thoughts were to get either some  blackout material that we can use to cover them or create some cutouts to place in the windows.  Movement. We had to move very carefully as to not rock the van.    All in all, it wasn't bad for a first experience. The most important thing for us was finding a quiet spot to park. We were both very tired this morning.  About our van:   1994 Chevy Conversion Sports Van Bed frame with queensized bed installed 2*100w solar panels (I've been bugging sub quite a bit as the best way to install them and I've given up for now).  1000w pure sine intverter. 125ah deep cycle AGM battery L.E.D strip lights   http://m.imgur.com/CC8SybP,SnlheK4,Y5Mr9hy,A1C6TjC,BUCRlkX,4vSZbV8 (imgur album of van in early stages)"
vandwellers,3d9nz5,kenbw2,12,Tue Jul 14 16:27:14 2015 UTC,"I definitely think you'd be better off with blackout material. I got some blackout material from eBay and hung them on my windows. I've previously detailed it here  As for visitors, I know what you mean about people being near you, it can be scary. My suggestion is to either park somewhere so remote that noone will be around, or somewhere populated enough that they wouldn't try anything.  I suppose your first spot was exactly that, and if you have blackout curtains then you'd be fine. Earplugs also help."
vandwellers,3d9nz5,Buckiller,6,Tue Jul 14 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"Hopefully with time you become desensitized to sleeping in the van.  My first attempt at sleeping was in a Wal-Mart parking lot in the afternoon and I don't think I really fell asleep I was so anxious (despite being so tired). There was a series of firsts after that that brought up that anxious feeling.  The first few months you'll learn your and outsiders' comfort levels around the van and you in it. I was surprised by how much I could get away with, actually.  At this point, after boon-docking in the city and burbs for over a year, nothing really causes me to lose sleep.   Light, and not being able to use it inside.   I have a cargo van but only a partial, non-blackout curtain dividing the cargo area from the cab. I'm also pretty limited with using light inside (else someone is worried about something going on back there). If the light that bleeds in from a light post or full moon is not enough, I've found my headlamp's red LED function works great to prevent too much bright, visible light from bouncing around or casting shadows."

I don't know what your battery situation is, but even so, I'd recommend having a second inverter to switch to when you don't need that much power.  Something in the range of 180 to 250w, depending on your evening needs.  The reason is that a large inverter stucks a lot of juice at idle and wastes a lot of power - and I've found that it's possible to keep a smaller inverter on all night while powering some low draw equipment without issue (I.e. chargers for phones, some of the new led 120v lights (I favor Sylvania's 4.5w, 40w equivalent soft white), and even a laptop that's playing movies or something.). I've managed a full night with a 4.5w, 120v led and a laptop running movies with a 55ah battery.  Just throwing it out there- it might not run an appliance, but you can always switch over to the big one if you need the Watts."

Here, I'm working with keeping it to a single grid over about 150ft (total) worth of wiring.  The batteries are outside of the main living quarters.  But yes, if it's an option and a compact situation, a couple of 12v outlets wouldn't hurt."

Light is the biggest trouble, with wind rush from passing cars or trucks the next biggest waker. Try earplugs and eyemasks to make things a little easier. Apart from that, it's about picking your spot (which you get better at) and using good curtains."
vandwellers,3d9nz5,Persona_Transplant,6,Tue Jul 14 23:14:41 2015 UTC,"Limo tint is a great start.  Then curtains.  I wouldn't worry so much about rocking the van.  Generally, no one cares.  You're more paranoid than you need to be.  You'll get used to that (surprisingly quickly).  24 hour Wal-Marts are great.  Yes, there's some noise, but not that much, if you find a parking spot in a corner somewhere against some trees."
vandwellers,3d9nz5,traveljack,7,Tue Jul 14 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Ah yes - the quest for perfect parking. It's definitely an art, and you'll soon get a feel for quiet, level spots where you can fit in. This will be a great story for your kids someday!  My range has definitely expanded since I covered my windows. I got black sturdy board from the art supply store (which is corrugated cardboard with a shiny black finish) and easily popped it into the windows after trimming slightly with an exacto knife. It is stiff enough to stay in place without fasteners and is great at keeping out light from street lamps, and also for privacy. it's not quite blackout quality, but it may be a good temporary solution until you get it perfect."

Be careful of smoking weed or drinking beer in your van, you might think you're safe parked up somewhere, but if the police turn up they could be dicks about it, here in the UK you can lose your licence for drink driving even if your sat in the back of the van without the keys.   Get a hammock and a couple of ratchet straps to put up of you're near any trees, it's just nice to lie in a hammock!   Make sure you keep a good stock of water, a small can of fuel, and some backup cans of food, it's shit when you run out of any of them and you want to stay somewhere a bit longer.   Do you have lights and a usb charger? That's the basic electrical needs, anything else is a bonus, I have a couple of inverters lying around incase I need mains power, but that's rare.   Keep on top of your mess, it's easy for washing up to pile up, laundry to build up, and tat in general to spiral out of control until one day you have to empty the entire van in a car park and load it back up bit by bit, dustpan and brush is a good investment!   Spread your valuables out in good stash spots around the van, I always get paranoid about a break in, so it sets my mind to rest if I know where my stuff is and if it's hard to find, it'll be safer. You can buy car alarm stickers from eBay, even if you don't have an alarm it'll act as a deterrent.   How will you deal with cold nights? This time of year is fine, but after September you'll want to think about heating or getting a thick duvet.

So although flexible panels made from an acrylic backing sheet is an improvement on aluminium, you will likely see a reduced cell efficiency and therefore output in high ambient temperatures."

If you have comprehensive coverage, you will owe the deductible to get it repaired.  But! Here is where you will get saved, have them issue you a check for your damages less the deductible. Say 3k in damage, $500 deductible, they will write you a check for 2500. Then get. Rental car or just get the window fixed. Ask if you can get a discount on a rental through them if you don't have coverage.   So review your policy, file a claim if appropriate coverage applies, make sure you have pictures etc.  Then get a payout for damages less the deductible and then independently fix the minimum to make your veh safe or just get a rental for a few weeks while you wait to get your paychecks.   Also, if you don't have comprehensive coverage, don't call in and add it. Then go file a claim for the next day. They will grill you with questions. Don't be dishonest, you choose the coverages and if you don't have them, then oh well.   Pm me with any more detailed questions you may have. Good luck!"

I mean really alone, the kind of alone you feel when you're half way across the country and haven't seen a familiar face in weeks. Been there, for months really. It does force you to spend time really looking at yourself, who you really are, who you'd like to be.  That's something most people don't really do.  If you're religious, it can be a time for growing closer to God without distraction.  If you're not, call it connecting with the universe, really getting an understanding of what it means to be alive, what your place is in the big picture. I know that sounds like new age hippie stuff, but you'll feel it, and you'll grow from it. The important thing to remember is that it's an adventure, something you'll learn from and remember for the rest of your life. Get ready to grow.  Embrace it."

But similarly to what /u/_zeppo_ said, and from my own experiences, going through with these types of adventures introduces huge opportunities for growth. Religiously, spiritually, personally, culturally, etc... So not that that's necessarily comforting, but you can at least take solace knowing that your experiences will be very valuable in one way or another in the long run. Exactly how depends on your outlook. What might be comforting, and what others have mentioned you'll likely discover fairly quickly, is that there are plenty of other people out there adventuring who feel the same as you. Without even trying you'll run into them and make friends. Long term, I hope to one day enjoy the van life as well! So here's to growth and adventure! cheers, have fun!"

vandwellers,3d4yow,sarautu,3,Mon Jul 13 16:43:13 2015 UTC,The thing maybe parked for months on end on my families woods and I have a little car i get around in just fine. So if that ads to the equation.
vandwellers,3d4yow,ICanFartTheAlphabet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:09:51 2015 UTC,"I've seen much worse -- it doesn't look like this one got used a whole lot.   As long as block isn't cracked, the 440 is popular with the racers so it may have better than average scrap value once you are done with it.   If you plan to use the appliances (fridge, stove), verify that they work. You'll need to get the propane tank recertified in all likelihood or propane places will refuse to fill it. Check for mice, they love to chew on wiring and upholstery.   It might need a couple batteries (one for the engine, other for the house). If you're gonna drive it, it will probably need fresh tires especially if you're doing anything more than putting around town."
vandwellers,3d4yow,crockett5,3,Mon Jul 13 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"It could be ok for 6 months, maybe 2 years or maybe 2 weeks. I wouldnt run away just because of the price, but I wouldnt just buy it because of the price either..  Only thing you can do is look at it and see what ""needs work"".   If you have a place to park it to live out of it, where you don't need to move it much, then $800 isnt a bad deal for 6 months rent, specially if you can resell it. However if you need to move it each day, then you need to be careful and make sure it doesn't have any major issues..  I've had many $500 cars when I was in my late teens to mid 20s they can be fine if you know how to fix them when they need fixing..  Btw the first class B I started with, I bought for $750.. I used it a bit and fixed up the inside and sold it for $2,500 6 months later.. It looked good on the outside though and the inside had issues.."

vandwellers,3d4yow,warm_n_toasty,3,Mon Jul 13 15:53:59 2015 UTC,"I guess, but this is 800 bucks. At that price its ok if it doesnt last long. Also, if you really wanted and the rest is good you can chuck a new/used engine in there and keep it going a lot longer."
vandwellers,3d4yow,robshookphoto,0,Mon Jul 13 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"A new/used engine going in would be several thousand - probably 5+, and that's only if you find one. On a 1977 van, I wouldn't be confident. I'd have to really like my house for it to be worth that cost and effort, and then you still run into body deterioration issues.  If the engine looks great, the price seems worth it but it just doesn't seem like it would give you more than a troubled 30k at best."

But there is a reason the majority of serious sailing cruisers know their way around their engine and boat - any kind of mobile home has innumerable things that will go wrong.  You're not paying for the engine to be fixed; you're paying for someone else's time spent fixing it. That costs many times more than the parts required, and the experience can be had through networking, manuals, and youtube."

vandwellers,3d4yow,ICanFartTheAlphabet,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:06 2015 UTC,Depends on the gearing. I had a car with a 440 that got ~7mpg city and over 20 highway.
vandwellers,3d4yow,realy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:47:04 2015 UTC,It is going to take some work to make the interior livable.  I just wouldn't want to put so much work into something that isn't going to last long anyway because the engine is so old.  Wait to find something that will last longer so that you can enjoy all the work you put into it.
vandwellers,3d4yow,Sehc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:54:21 2015 UTC,A 1977 Dodge Van with a 440 cid? Should be a 318 or 360. Both good long lasting engines.

vandwellers,3d4gvl,geo38,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"Rain x anti fog works quite well, not sure about the others.   But here's the thing. I'm about 99.9% sure rain x anti fog is just denatured alcohol. The secret to keeping your windows fog free is keeping them clean. Like super clean. Make your own glass cleaner out of 1 part denatured alcohol and one part distilled water and your windows will fog much less.  (I add a dash of blue glass cleaner just so it's obvious what it is. But I also keep a spray bottle of plain water around).   Now if you're trying to keep your windows from fogging while you're hanging out in the van or sleeping and all the windows are closed and there's no air circulation you're fighting a losing battle no matter how clean your window are."

It will mean that you have to cut a hole in the roof if there isn't one already. In that sense it will damage your roof. You will need a jig saw, a drill, and caulking, not to mention the electrical extras."

vandwellers,3d2n8q,nixsee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:04:07 2015 UTC,I did maxxfan in steel rooftop. Was quite easy. Get the maxxfan though - integrated rain cover is amazing. I can't imagine why anyone would use something else.
vandwellers,3d2n8q,robshookphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:52 2015 UTC,"Because they're insanely expensive?   You can buy a new marine hatch (or ten used) and a regular fan at that price, and have a skylight/roof access/vent/multidirectional fan in one."
vandwellers,3d2n8q,nixsee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:46:53 2015 UTC,"Oh right. For all those times you just want to climb onto the roof, through a fan.

It's an awesome deck and I sit up there almost every day. It's also a better way to access solar panels than setting up a ladder.   I recognize that this sub is obsessed with them, but they're both pretty expensive for what they are."

vandwellers,3d1b3y,kimadagem,2,Sun Jul 12 18:25:37 2015 UTC,The data sounds very expensive. $80 gets you an unlimited account with Tmobile. You get 7gb of tethering(after 7gb it slows down but there are ways to hide your tethering) and unlimited on your phone. Pay $110 and you get two lines(each with 7gb of tethering) and 5gb for a tablet(can be hotspotted). Basically 19gb of tethering for $110.
vandwellers,3d1b3y,traveljack,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"T mobile subscriber here. $70 gets me unlimited (actually unlimited not att/sprint/verison ""unlimited"") data. Also I have free unlimited tethering."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:05:58 2015 UTC,What plan is this? Are you grandfathered into something they don't offer anymore?
vandwellers,3d1b3y,hellabryanstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"My plan isn't grandfathered - that idea always seemed sketchy to me. I simply knew it as the ""$70 unlimited everything plan."""
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:41:39 2015 UTC,How do you hide tethering?
vandwellers,3d1b3y,alotofwastedeffort,2,Sun Jul 12 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"A few ways. First off, they likely don't check if you're using a 3rd party app (like PDA Net), but assuming they do, you can use a Proxy server (free), a VPN server (better security, slower, usually costs money) or TOR (slowest, although not too bad in recent years, highest level of security, free)"
vandwellers,3d1b3y,CJ-Johnson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:01:10 2015 UTC,they likely don't check if you're using a third party app   It's not like that. Whether or not an app rats on you depends on how it routes your traffic. TetherMe and PDANet send traffic over standard APNs instead of carrier provided ones. But I've heard people have lost their data plans while relying on tetherme and PDANet isn't free. I used PDANet years ago and remember having compatibility issues with it.   Proxy server (free)   Dangerous.   VPN server   Hides your IP behind a company if they don't keep logs. Doesn't may hide your tethering usage.   TOR   Is exploitable and also doesn't hide your tethering usage.  Either a rooted tether app or cyanogenmod's built in hotspot would do the trick for free.
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:34:23 2015 UTC,"I think you've misunderstood.  You're right about the carrier not being able to read the traffic behind a vpn but wrong about them not being able to see how much data is being used. A vpn doesn't make the data packets invisible, only encrypted."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:26:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for brining this up. Maybe I'm the one who's mistaken. I did some googling and see there's some debate on the subject. But I'm glad to hear it works for you.  My hotspot never works when the vpn is connected to my phone. How'd you configure yours?
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:00:44 2015 UTC,"What is dangerous about using a proxy? I just upgraded to the $80 T-Mobile plan and would like to use one of these options to tether to my laptop, but all of this is very new to me so any help is greatly appreciated."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,hellabryanstyle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:14:10 2015 UTC,This ehow article lists several reasons why proxies can be dangerous. Another reason is because honeypots.  For free tethering the first step is root your phone. Second step is download a tethering app that requires root and doesn't report your tethering data usage.  That oughta be it.
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, this gets confusing to me so let me make sure I understand this. I did check T-Mobile's site, briefly.  $80 is unlimited but for a smartphone, yes? Because their data plans don't come unlimited (I think they go up to 11 gigs). So I'd have to buy a phone and use it as a hotspot, yes? Which is a different form of tethering from what I described in the OP. My current phone does have a setting for it (I think) but my carrier doesn't allow tethering so I've never tried it.  So - is that right? And does tethering basically work like a hotspot, in terms of the speed? Also - has anyone here used T-Mobile while moving around? I've pretty much stayed away from them because their coverage maps look really spotty compared to Verizon's or AT&T's (I don't know what Sprint is doing). I'm stuck here on the East Coast for a while but when I start traveling I want to be sure I can get a signal when I'm not near a big city."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,traveljack,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, use it as a hotspot. You can hide your tethering. Me? I haven't had a need to do it though I experimented with it. I've got 19gb of tethering and unlimited on two phones. I use my phone for what I can use my phone for. My wife's g3 has Miracast and the Amazon Fire stick is a cheap Miracast adapter so we use that for streaming movies in the motorhome. You actually might find you can do some of what you want to do with a Miracast/Slimport adapter and a bluetooth keyboard...."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,2,Tue Jul 14 08:37:57 2015 UTC,What's the model number of your hotspot?
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"According to the ""about"" screen it's an AirCard 770s."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"According to this all you have to do is plug it into your laptop.    By default, a host driver is installed the first time you connect your mobile hotspot to the computer via the USB cable. This driver enables the mobile hotspot to connect to the Internet when it is tethered to a USB port on the computer via the USB cable instead of using the Wi-Fi network."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,CJ-Johnson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This looks like the same page that's in my user manual. The hotspot's been plugged into the computer for most of the time I've had it so I would think the driver's been installed (I didn't tell it not to do that) but the only way I can connect is through WIFI. The computer does have a setting for ""connect automatically"" that I have turned off - with limited data I always want to control when I'm connected - but even that's for the WIFI.  It does take two steps even to connect via WIFI - I have to hit a button on the device and then connect using the network icon on the computer - but I've tried just using one of those and there's no connection, whether I've tried from the device or the computer. I must be missing something."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,CJ-Johnson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's the drivers if you want to try manually installing them. I don't have this device or a windows machine but I assume you need these drivers so your computer can recognise the device over usb. If it already installed them automatically like it should then I don't know. You could try turning off wifi either on the hotspot and/or computer to make sure it isn't overriding your usb tether connection. My money's on the drivers though.  You're right about the usb tether being more secure and I'd also guess it takes less battery. But I don't think it'll give you better speeds. You're simplest option may be to just hide your ssid. You can still connect to the wifi but no one else will see your network name being broadcast. To do this goto the wifi tab, click advanced, then under security select ""hide"" next to ""broadcast network name."""
vandwellers,3d1b3y,Solarnynja,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"You're overpaying for very little data. Might I suggest you buy an old iPad plan?  $30/month for an unlimited unthrottled 4G hotspot with AT&T. It's prepaid so the accounts are fully transferable. No contracts, no limits. The only catch is if you stop paying even for one month, you lose the plan and can't get it back.  It's also just a SIM card so you can stick it in a phone, tablet or hotspot no problem.  That's the route I went with, at least. I don't think there's a better option :D  Edit: Oh and the Unite Pro allows 2.4ghz/5ghz wifi and allows USB tethering even with the wifi off"
vandwellers,3d1b3y,CJ-Johnson,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer. I'm confused though; I don't have an iPad, I have a laptop that runs Windows. My plan is for the device I have; I can't use any of the other plans.  Also - My hotspot is a Unite 770s; I don't know if that's the same as the Unite Pro but it's the only one I could find that went with the GoPhone plans. And, what do those figures (2.4/5 ghz)? And if this Unite Pro is the same as what I have, how do I set up tethering? That's the question I can't seem to get answered."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,Solarnynja,2,Tue Jul 14 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"You dont need an iPad. The plan was originally sold with the iPad back in 2010, but it can be used on any device  2.4ghz wifi and 5ghz wifi are two different frequencies. Not all hotspots support USB tethering but the Unite Pro does :)  What I dont think you're getting, though, is the plan I'm talking about is UNLIMITED data with no speed throttling. It's a lot better than being capped at 2gb."

There's currently one at a great price ($400 cheaper than what I paid) but I doubt it will stay that low. Current fair market rate is hard to say but it's in the ballpark of $1200-$1400."
vandwellers,3d1b3y,Solarnynja,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:02 2015 UTC,That's pretty damn expensive.

They can live long periods of time without feeding, like up to a year, so don't try to starve them out either.    Chemicals available to most consumers won't really kill them all effectively.  Most effective treatments involve heat - very high temps (like 140 F) should be very effective to kill them, but they may just scramble outside of the van temporarily until the heat is removed.    Don't know what to tell you - except that they will probably be easier to get rid of in the van as opposed to a house."
vandwellers,3d07c5,crowjr,13,Sun Jul 12 13:56:20 2015 UTC,"As someone who used to have bed bugs, it sounds like that might be what your dealing with. Keep using the DE. That stuff works on all exo-skelital (is that a word?) insects. It takes a while though and you need to re apply every couple weeks. While your waiting for the DE to work, you need to cook your van. Bed bugs die around 120 f if exposed for a couple hours. Park your van in the sun and run a heater if you can. Get it as hot as you can for a few hours. Bed bugs are pervasive little shits and will probly take a couple months to eradicate completely but just keep at it. There are also some sprays you can use that work but are pretty potent. Good luck"
vandwellers,3d07c5,Aeorik,7,Sun Jul 12 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"I am with this guy. Dump Diatomaceous Earth into your mattress and blow it into every crack of your vehicle. Just completely dust the crap out of everything and wear a dust mask, stuff is not good for your lungs.  You can also salt and use baking soda to the same end. I have had horrible flea infestations in carpets and got rid of them within a couple of weeks with this route.   Lastly as far as getting rid of them, you can make a cheap bug spray mixture with dish-soap and water. I've dealt with bad roach infestations while traveling this way. It works on the same principle as DE, baking soda and salt, by drying out the exoskeleton.  You also have to wash everything. All your clothing, bedding, pillows, etc. If you have carpet, you should probably just rip it up and go for a hard linoleum floor - much easier to clean anyway.  As for you, you can drink apple cidar vinegar and other nasty things to discourage bugs from biting you. Garlic is also another good thing to deter bites. I am sure you can find a nice list of things bugs find toxic to eat online."

I agree with you, most vans that people are willing to live in are usually built around a truck frame and not a unibody like a Caravan or a Montana or the like. They usually have the same engine options, transmission and differential as their truck counterparts too. My grandparents bought a 94 Safari XT (not AWD sadly, though it never stopped them from going into the bush) with a V6 brand new and used it to drag an old travel trailer across most of northern BC. They also used it for dragging logs, pulling stumps, loaded up with fishing gear and a boat on the roof down nearly endless miles of forgotten logging roads to lakes with names I don't remember, even hauling hundreds of pounds of animal feed in the back along with us kids and a bunch of groceries from the nearest city 2 hours away. When they passed on, it was left to me and I put it through more hell (though I wish I babied it now; even if it would have been well over 450 thousand KM by now) by taking it back through the bush and bajaing around with friends loaded in the back. It was always more truck than van, right from day one, and it never let us down except that one time we really could have used the AWD. A 2WD truck would have done the same though.  Yeah a bus can haul more, but I'd reckon that V6 would trump the mileage in any small schooly."

The weight of the panels and air resistance when traveling highway speeds will cause the top to flex and potentially fail.

Buy the semi flexible solar panels and mount them with the correct sikaflex for your roof. Cleanliness is the key. The flexible solar panels often have excellent sunpower modules on them. They have no frame and you should get sizes to fit your van. The absolute best flexible solar panels are no longer made, unisolar. They also happen to be the wierdest shapes. Also, because they lie flush with roof, they don't stand out like dog's balls  If you have already bought your panels and they are of the framed type. The general consensus on exploroz (the Oz expedition/grey nomads site) is to mount the panels on mounts as per usual and then sikaflex the mounts (four per panel) to the roof).  Motto here, no holes if you can help it as mentioned here by the other posters as well"

You're doing good if the previous owner was competent. This alone is a good argument for doing as much of it yourself as possible.

vandwellers,3cy5ke,HazyGaze,3,Sat Jul 11 22:01:12 2015 UTC,There is going to be far greater choice in vans which haven't been fitted out yet.

So now I'm left with something that's perfect for my travelling needs.
vandwellers,3cy5ke,Tigerstack,2,Sat Jul 11 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Agree with everyone else. Do it yourself and you'll get something that works perfectly for your needs. In addition to being able to fix it easier,  you'll have useful tools and knowledge for life.   It takes a while to do it well though. Probably 2-3 months, depending on how much time you dedicate regularly, skill level, etc... I figured it would only be a couple weeks of full time work, but there's always a problem and always something else to add or change.  I've been full timing in it for a month now, and will continue to finish things over the next month or so. I just dismantled my ""kitchen"" yesterday and rebuilt some stuff because the previous layout was stupid. You'll learn how the space works as you live in it and it would have been a lot harder if it was someone else's stupid design rather than my own."

vandwellers,3cxzur,hairyhippogriff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:09:16 2015 UTC,conversion vans and cargo vans are usually built on the same chasis....meaning that mileage should be the same on either of them.  If you want better mileage just get a smaller engine (V6 3.0L instead of V8 5.4L) and drive slower.  I like the cargo vans better because you can 100% customize it but that takes a LOT of work.  if you buy a conversion you start with quite a bit groundwork already laid which can save you tons of time.  I'd say hop on craigslist and go look at 20 vans 10 cargo and 10 conversion and see which one feels more at home for you.
vandwellers,3cxzur,CatchMeIfYouVAN,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:05:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm going to go with a conversion, but strip out the back. I get the windows (which are pretty much a necessity for me) plus the blank slate. I feel that cargo vans aren't any more stealthy, especially when you toss solar panels and a vent on the roof. A conversion van is much more normal-looking in a neighborhood or parking lot, so it may be more stealthy (though this is something I'd have to test, I guess).  Plus, getting a decent conversion van seems much smarter than an a decent work van since many conversion vans are used as family vacation vehicles while work vans are usually driven pretty rough, so I'm thinking a conversion van would last a bit longer too."
vandwellers,3cxzur,svkb,2,Sun Jul 12 00:41:32 2015 UTC,"Good points, that is what I'm thinking. I think I really want the windows that we can open up to get some air flow. Fresh air and sunlight is a huge thing for me. Do you have any design plans for yours yet? It will be my boyfriend and I in our van so we need to have a bigger bed, but I came up with an idea last night for a folding one (bench during the day, slides out to bed at night) that I think will help us maximize space."
vandwellers,3cxzur,svkb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:05:10 2015 UTC,"I used to have a well thought out design that I made in Google Sketchup, then I completely scrapped it. My plan now is pretty much all mental.  I have a few pieces of IKEA furniture and a countertop (A, B, C, D, E) that I'll put up against the wall opposite to the door and against the back doors. The shorter 2 will be under the counter and the wardrobe thing will hold all my clothes and some junk. The 3 part cabinet will probably be on it's side (like a chest) and store some larger junk or just school supplies. As for the bed, I sleep on a Japanese-style futon, so my bed can roll up an be put up in the corner and I sit on the floor for everything, so having no seating isn't an issue. I'm probably not the best person to give design advice since my plan is so centered around my lifestyle, which is a bit out there for even vandwellers."

(you don't want teh reflectix right on the window)  then he used super glue and those neudenium magnets that you get 8 in a package from a store like home depot.  those are teh strong magnets, but it's better to have more small ones then a few big ones, because the big ones will pull off the glue and also the small ones you can have a tighter seal locking out all the light around the windows.

No matter how good your build, and mine was good,vans and vehicles are impossible to insulate truly effectively. If you try and heat your van to 'normal house' temperatures at minus 30, you will fail,and you will spend a lot of money in fuel failing.  Instead, make your goal keeping the inside above freezing, so your plumbing and water and other goods are okay, and sleep with arm blankets and a wool cap. You will likely find you sleep even better if the air outside your bed is cool. I set my furnace (I installed a propane powered RV furnace under the bed, you can get them cheap from wreckers) at 3 degrees C in the winter, and crack a window.

I have my bicycle and plenty of other gear in here that wouldn't have had a chance of getting in the VW.   I've spent 2 months on and off customizing it and it's nearly complete and is far better inside than a VW or mostly anything I could have found prefab. I love the layout. And since I built it, I know how everything works. I tore apart my kitchen yesterday and rebuilt it because I wasn't happy with the layout (I only use cheap, recycled materials so time is the only factor). But i dont have a job and enjoy doing this sort of work.   I think it all comes down to how do you want to spend your time? Building a custom van or just starting? Do you plan to spend a lot of time in there or live your life elsewhere and come home to sleep? The height and other measurements might make a difference there."

I'd loathe another month or two in my hometown. The van I'd prefer if it's all said and down is the Dodge A108. But that VW has some definite pros to and. And the most relevant to my now, are the time and $ factor. No more time or $ necessary. Maybe I can sell it along the way and find my dream Dodge, a late sixties Custom Sportsman with the nice exterior chrome and other goodies.   I'd plan on being out and about most days.

vandwellers,3cvcu5,ohnoiowa,2,Sat Jul 11 02:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm completely unclear on your intended application, but the refrigerant, while integral, is only one part of a very balanced system.   If it's your intent to recharge an existing system, overcharging it will do more harm than good(seals, pressure exchange ratios...) so just fill it to the proper pressure. It might be a good idea to change the low and high side O-rings/valves if the unit is older and it's never been done.--The O-rings and valves can quickly be swapped with a schrader valve tool. Auto AC systems are not hermetic and require regular charging but if you fix the O-rings it will work better and longer. Also make sure any filters and ducting are free flowing including the external(high side) exhaust vent.--If the external coil exhaust cannot dissipate heat in an efficient manner it will result in pressure irregularities and greatly reduce the cooling(12v computer fan if you aren't moving). If you're feeling brave and have the ability to clean the coils, do it.    If it's your intent to rig a system for venting the gases through tubing then you'll make that tubing cold and wet for almost a full minute.    Edit: The refrigerant gases that are used(since the late 90's) are a combination of gases that breakdown at different altitudes and temperatures. It's best to do a liquid charge and if the system has been out of order for a while then replace all of the gas in the system so the correct ratios are present(one gas can boil-off faster than the rest)."

I'm not interested in charging my existing van AC - but when the time comes, this is my reference! I see now how unclear this post is.   Specifically, I'm interested in the possibility of an auxillary AC system for cooling my sleeping area through the night.  I have a solar 12vDC system, grey water reservoir, a 7GAL clean water supply and adequate fan ventilation.  The methods I've seen online for DIY cooling have been pretty hairball.. I'd like to know the essentials of how the AC system works and if it is possible, recreate it for Aux use - about 8 hours at a time.  Based on the replies so far, the refrigerants at auto stores seem like a bad choice.  Would there be another product that could be used?"

I was wondering if the mechanics of it would work out cheaper, more energy efficient and less troublesome/obvious than other DIY cooling ideas (ice chest+fan, a billion fans, actual window units, etc).  My main concern is keeping cool through the night while running off aux power.   The climate here is hot enough to soak your clothes in sweat while sleeping.  my auxiliary power is 12v solar.  I have a grey water holding tank, a 7GAL water supply and adequate ventilation.  Doesn't it seem feasible to develop a small scale DIY AC system with these fundamentals?

Although I could be completely wrong here.  Do you work in an air conditioned environment or outside? I've found that the worst thing about living in a warm place is the shock to your body that comes from trying to transition back and forth. Once you accept the heat as much as you can your body will become much more comfortable with it and adapt. If you have access to a gym or other facility take a nice cold shower right before bed."
vandwellers,3cvcu5,Sehc,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:10:55 2015 UTC,"Actual refrigerant-based AC is power-hungry. About the smallest systems you're going to find are 5000 BTU window units for about $120 new. This size is about right for keeping a van cool at night, and a bit underpowered during the day, especially in the Texas sun. They'll take about 600W or so, so you aren't going to run that on your house batteries unless you've got an unusual power setup (figure about 30 minutes run-time per big-ass battery). If you have shore power you'd be fine with one of these.  Are you in humid Texas or dry Texas? If you are in dry Texas you might get workable results from a swamp cooler. Usually these are direct evaporation systems because that is simple and cheap, but it sounds like maybe you are willing and able to do some fabrication. In that case you might be able to do an indirect evaporative system. The advantage is that you don't add humidity to the air.  Of course, if you're sweaty anyway, the best possible evaporative cooler is going to be a fan blowing directly on you plus, very important, good ventilation of the van. Without that the humidity in the van will be too high to evaporate any sweat and you'll just stew.  You could also consider a neck cooler. Put some ice and water in a cooler and get a fountain pump to go inside. Pump the water through a vinyl hose and lay it across the back of your neck (or along your sides, whatever works for you). Some people like this direct cooling approach, some don't. Drawback is that it consumes ice, which could get expensive over time."

vandwellers,3cplqk,cookieguy10,9,Thu Jul 9 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"It's gets better man.  You will eventually find awesome (flat spots) to park. You will get your sink setup and running.   Stay positive!   My advice is too figure out how to enjoy yourself, you are free.  And it gets better and better.   Soon enough you will say, why didn't do this earlier."
vandwellers,3cplqk,rKremlin,4,Thu Jul 9 19:52:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the encouragement. I think it will just take time to get used to this lifestyle.
vandwellers,3cplqk,eatmyvan,8,Fri Jul 10 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"A 24 hour gym is essential unless you can shower at work or relatives.    Dont ever skimp on hygiene or exercise. Exercise is also good for your mental state.  As Op mentioned, you have to make concessions to keep your spirits up."
vandwellers,3cplqk,eatmyvan,6,Thu Jul 9 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, you might want to look into a hammock.  Here is my setup from from my 8 month stint of urban van dwelling.  As you'll see, I had only the bare essentials in a van that I assume is much smaller than yours if you have room for a sink.    You say that you want to ""minimize your reliance on others' facilities"" while I did just the opposite.  I relied on the public pool for showers, the public library for working (internet), public streets for parking, and the grocery store was my ""pantry.""  It was some of the best 8 months of my life and I couldn't have done it without the comfort of the hammock.  And this is coming from someone who destroyed his back working construction in his early 20s.  I'm in an apartment now but I'm still hammock sleeping..  Get your sleeping situation comfy and hit the gym/public pool, my friend.  You'll stop feeling homeless almost immediately.    Renting a driveway is something I also considered at the beginning but I eventually warmed up to the streets.  Instead of looking at it as a ""lack of stability"" look at it as freedom.  Sneaking around and being stealthy can be a lot of fun if you choose to perceive it as fun!    I miss it and I'm jealous!  (Though I'm not jealous of that child support bill..)  Hit the gym!  Stay clean!  Eat healthy!  Get confident and proud of your new lifestyle and then get out there and get laid, my friend!"
vandwellers,3cplqk,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I like your take on things. Regarding the hammock, do they work well for a side sleeper?"
vandwellers,3cplqk,BaywardBoondocker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:52:34 2015 UTC,It's possible but I think it's much more comfortable on your back.  The trick is to lay diagonal.  Buy one and test it out on some trees in the park.  If you decide it won't work then you can always return it.  Good luck!
vandwellers,3cplqk,warm_n_toasty,5,Fri Jul 10 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"RE washing yourself. If you have a stove and a kettle, buy a couple 6 pack of bar mop cloths and a big sealable tub. heat the water in the kettle and use that and a fresh bar cloth (fresh one each wash, cant stress this enough) to give yourself a scrub down and wring out the water into the tub. If you have a sink plumbed in then you can use that instead obviously. use blue shop towels on the parts of you that are particularly gross (arse and wang mostly). Ive been doing this for 6 months now and even without soap I never end up smelling. I havent used shampoo for almost 10 years now so I dont need to worry about that. You can visit /r/nopoo if you want to go down that route and save a bit of hassle.   Make sure everything you wear and sleep on/in is clean as well. fresh undies socks and t shirt every day, wash all your bedding and towels every few weeks etc."
vandwellers,3cplqk,cookieguy10,2,Thu Jul 9 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"So true.. I found that just putting a fresh pair of cotton clothes on my body absorbed the oils of the skin.  I've been really wanting to do the 2 bucket method for washing but haven't found a small pale with a lid from the stores yet..   I really am not a fan of baby wipes because they leave a gross residue and I realized they were actually making me feel dirty more than if I hadn't used the wipes the day before.     I think that ya, the wash cloth is the way to go with some water.        I have an ecotemp l5 propane water heater on my van and if I'm in a city that has a 24hr fitness I use that, and if not then I end up using this water and wash cloth method.       For anyone interested in seeing it. of course I'm bayward boondocker on youtube."
vandwellers,3cplqk,turks4change,2,Thu Jul 9 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"the tub I am using at the moment is just a sterilite ultra seal from walmart I think. Nice wide opening so you dont get water everywhere and its got a 'watertight seal' (I wouldnt go pushing it too far though. yeah it seals it but it doesnt feel that secure).  I never tried babywipes so I cant comment. Seems awfully wasteful though, and how good do they really clean? you can give yourself a proper scrub with a bar cloth. I've been pleasantly surprised with how effective theyve been.   that water heater looks the tits! I cant wait to have money to start fitting out the van properly. At the moment I'm just making do with what I've got."

I used to worry about this when I just started. Then I realized that no one cares and I care less..3   The hardest part of the build for me to figure out has been the bed   This doesn't work for everyone but maybe see if a hammock would work for you. Goes away when you don't need it and it is comfy   Fantastic Fan   This and a good solar run refrigerator is something everyone needs if they want to do this full time, IMHO. Makes it so much nicer having a cold beer to come home to :P   One thing I have seriously considered is renting a driveway for $100 or $200 per month. I'm fine without electricity (solar is next week) and need nothing but a small patch of earth to park the van. I'm going to give myself another month or so to see if things settle down, but that could be an option for me.   I would look into getting an isolator/solenoid as well as solar. Also, I would give it more time before you considering buying a parking space. I had the same thought when I was working a corporate job in the same area but I evenually figured out a good rotation of 4 spots near my job that were quite and private."

It allows you to be where you want when you want on your own terms.  Money pretty much just starts piling up if you have a job and you'll find you won't need to be a slave to the 8hr workday.     Just keep it up and you'll prefer it to a house in time.  You'll figure out your systems and start prospering.  Great job!  Keep us posted, man!"

It's hard at first, but think of all the times you've walked past a van and never given it a second though (or considered that someone may be staying in there and not thought anything more about it). Good luck!"
vandwellers,3cplqk,osulumberjack,2,Fri Jul 10 06:43:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts. I think having a comfortable bed should probably be near the top of anyone's priorities. I've put a lot of thought into the problem of parking on surfaces that aren't level. The best thing I can come up with (while still planning) is to build the bed platform on four small 4X4 posts and use shims to compensate. Granted, that's a bit of a PITA but I'd rather do that than sleep at an angle. Anyone else have a solution?"

vandwellers,3cplqk,robshookphoto,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:13:08 2015 UTC,"I have spent some time thinking about this as well.  I saw one post a while back where they created like a Murphy bed that folded down from the wall and it used ratchet straps to hold up the other side of the bed.  That made it adjustable but required some sort of frame inside the van.    I was considering some sort of adjustable scissor mechanism on the frame.  It really only needs a couple inches of total travel.  I suspect I am way overthinking things, but I just can't help myself."
vandwellers,3cplqk,warm_n_toasty,2,Thu Jul 9 22:28:11 2015 UTC,Why not use 2 small car jacks on each end? Make them easily removed so you can still use them to work on the van if needed.

No one can say yeah you'll be fine leaving it on a public street. General rule is you have to move your vehicle every 72 hours right?  I don't think it's worth the worry not knowing if you got towed or your van got broken into while you're away. Tow lot storage fees are insane so storing your vehicle right is worth the peace of mind.

vandwellers,3cl32q,kimadagem,8,Wed Jul 8 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"Custom? Not really. Lots of camper company's bought VW Buses and then customized them with high tops (Of varying shapes and sizes), popups or just camper interiors with a tin top.  Not to say that guy didn't start with a tin top and add one from a parts bus though, but he probably didn't.  Personally, I wouldn't pay 15k for it. The price seems kinda high, and it has been lowered which to me is a huge no-go as I like going offroad. But it also doesn't seem to have much rust, which is a great thing on any old vehicle. He has done quite abit to make it more liveable too...  If you want a VW go on thesamba.com and look around. If I was going to live in one and dead set on a VW I'd probably look for a Vanagon or Eurovan, way newer, less of a theft target, and they blend in more, etc. If you have an old Bus people will be coming up to take pix and talk all the time. Depending on your POV that can be good or bad. But there is something to be said about the old school aircooled motors that are dead simple and cheap to keep running like the Bays and Splits. IIRC it was 69 or 70 the Bay windows switched to a different motor then the oldies, which has way power but not quite as easy to work on as the older models."

The engine on this bus when it was brand new was producing less than 50hp. This bus is probably barely moving with all that weight of everything that's in the back of it.  That being said there is one good thing about these old air cooled engines. They are super easy to maintain, as long as you have two hands (one will probably do the trick too) some wrenches and can get parts you will never have to pay someone to fix it. They are about as complex as your average lawn mower and there are manuals for them that walk you step by step how to fix pretty much everything that could go wrong with this engine. No ECUs, no OEM nuts and bolts, no smart fuse boxes. Just good old fashioned metal."

I suggest heading to Montauk and getting a permit to park on the beach(if you do its like 110$ and to be honest don't know if its worth it as i didn't park on the beach call and double check and make sure that you could park on the beach for the night if you have the permit) when I went there last year I saw a few people parked on the beach the scenery was amazing the stars were so clear that night it was amazing..

If he's active and been running around a lot, then absolutely DO NOT bring him. He will suffer and get depressed really easily, and he will show that to you with less affection/eating more/not be friends with you.

The biggest concern I would have is that you can't leave the animal unattended in the vehicle without either air conditioning or an exceptional powered ventilation system (and that probably wouldn't be enough in warmer climates).  If you're going to have shore power, like parking at RV sites or something, it's probably doable. If you're aiming for stealth though, I'd say it's probably unworkable."

I took him home, fed him (he ate nonstop for a couple of days), and got him neutered (he needed it and it may explain what he was doing lost in the first place ;-).    He was great about riding in the car, but would get really really excited and start talking when he saw big trucks. I think he was hoping to find his daddy. He loved men, and I ended up giving him to one of his ""guy"" friends when I could no longer keep him.   He lived to a ripe old age (at least 16 or 17) doing guy stuff with his guy friends.

Interior height is 4 foot to the headliner so no standing. youd gain a couple inches with a panel van.   Theyre decent and theres a reason you see so many of them, the engines just keep going. Im almost at 150000 miles and its still starts up without a problem, except when the egr valve gets stuck open :P . you will have problems but there are tonnes of videos on youtube about how to fix anything as well as a couple of great forums with tonnes of info. Also same engine used in the chevy blazer so tonnes of spares everywhere. the chevy 90 degree v6 is pretty legendary. Youre unlucky to have anything catastrophically break on these things, but put money aside for the little things. Its a bit of a pain in the ass to work on but such is life with a van.   edit: I forgot to mention the AWD module breaks so you have to remove and resolder it. bit of pain in the ass even if you can do it right, but i stripped one of the bolts so im going to need to take it to a garage for them to remove the entire master cyclinder."

Now I have to decide what to do when this one soon dies: should I go with another Astro? ...I would have to say yes. I really like it as a van. I plan on spending more time to find something in better condition with fewer km and move my conversion into it. So even after all the problems I would buy another one.

It's possible to find full-size Chevy vans with 4WD (idk about AWD) but they are rare.

vandwellers,3ch7a0,axf7228,8,Wed Jul 8 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"79' GMC Vandura.  Was dark blue.  I bought not enough white spray paint, made it look mostly cloudy.  Replaced the silver horizontal stripe round the middle with a triple strip of red, green, and yellow.  Strapped the unicycle on the rear ladder.  The passenger seat was a lawn chair straddling two tires set over the seat post (for safety).  Nobody would look directly at the van.  If you've ever read the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, you're aware of the cloaking field on available to a ship with a Bistromathic drive, the Somebody Else's Problem field.  From wikipedia :   Within the novel Life, the Universe and Everything of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy science fiction series, his character Ford Prefect describes Somebody Else's Problem as:  An SEP is something we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's somebody else's problem.... The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If you look at it directly you won't see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye.  The narration then explains:  The technology involved in making something properly invisible is so mind-bogglingly complex that 999,999,999 times out of a billion it's simpler just to take the thing away and do without it....... The ""Somebody Else's Problem field"" is much simpler, more effective, and ""can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery.""  This is because it relies on people's natural predisposition not to see anything they don't want to, weren't expecting, or can't explain.   I could go anywhere, and nobody would look directly at the van.  Eventually, I repainted the van, a boring, neutral blue.  I took the unicycle off the back. Only then did I realize what I had lost.  I became suddenly aware of the people looking at the ""nondescript van"".  Cops hawked me, people stared.  I could feel the eyes all around me, heads swiveling, judging my level of stranger danger.  My cloaking field was gone.  Soon after, I had to get an apartment, then the van died, and became a shed.  Three years later it was towed to a small garage where, I'm told, became a stationary home to two junkie lesbians."

I love that set up on the late model Astros but it will be a ton of work. On a vanagon I think it's a bit more doable because the rear hatch already opens up and it's easier to make the bottom swing open.  However on a normal van like a full size ford, you will have the harder job of figuring out a hinge set up for the upper section.  I actually have a spare rear hatch sitting at my dad's place in FL, which I held onto just for that mod, if I decided to try it.   Keep in mind anything can be done, but you need to be either good enough to do it yourself or be willing to spend upwards of $2-3k to have a specialty shop do it for you as it's going to be a decent amount of hand fabercation."

Usually a PVC pipe that runs from the top of black (sewage) tank to the top of vehicle an out the roof or side.  Make sure it's not blocked...the odor is methane gas. This tube should exhaust the smell out and away from your rig.   I've had good results of bleach. I empty the tank, then fill it with bleach water and let it set for 30 minutes, then repeat with just water. You might need to do a bleach rinse a few times.   Also helpful is water softner like Calgon. Add a cup to your full black tank, then take a 30 minute drive. The vibration and movement will un-stick any solid deposits. The Calgon will keep it from sticking back  together or to the tank walls."

Underneath I can fit 5 rubbermaid storage bins.   I'm 6' and can stretch out with room to spare. My mattress ends about where the backrest drops off to become the seat.   It's possible to convert to a bed without getting out, but it takes a bit of acrobatics to push the seat all the way forward and recline it all the way while you're still in it.

It also has fake-leather seats. Honestly I like the van you're showing us better than mine.   It's a good van, roomy, the bed is comfortable, the chairs are easy to set outside if you're camping somewhere and you want seating in your campsite.   The gas mileage is horrible, and I have a hard time seeing out the (many, many) rear windows when I'm changing lanes while driving.   Overall, it's not bad."

Out there, you'll have no issueswith the law. Everybody is destitute and poor, most living in vehicles and many running from the law. It's basically a mix of convicts, mentally disabled people, and hipsters.   However, you will NOT make it through the winter out there. No way. Absolutely no way.

If you are a Walmart regular; a number of them in Colorado do not allow overnight. Although I had a good experience at the one on Loop 470 at the edge of Littleton, 15 min down from Golden. Right in the Golden area, I honestly don't know where you would park at night. It is such a small town with only a Safeway and no 24hr place I remember.  As far as campgrounds, keep in mind many of them fill every night during the peak season and require reservations. State parks are usually your best bet price wise; get a year pass and use the facilities during the day even if you don't camp overnight. You can be in line when the sites go on sale around noon if you don't do a reservation.   Make sure you know your vehicle and what you are getting into driving across the Rocky Mountains. Condition of brakes, transmission are critical. Make sure you know how to properly downshift so you don't burn up your brakes."

There's a ton of overnight parking and nobody seems to care that you're vandwelling; I haven't been bothered by anyone yet. It's a cool city on the rise with a good amount of jobs, and the mountains are next door. Winter was cold at times hah, but just as often warm and sunny."

He would sleep untill noon or mostly later, brush his teeth at the curb, and other foolish stuff. The neighbors soon complained. I was demonized by letting him park. He had no idea to be reasonably stealthy."
vandwellers,3ccqmn,Sehc,3,Tue Jul 7 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"I think I know how you feel, I was in a fever rush to try to ""find somewhere to rent "" on a private property.  I mean you could be self contained, not loud etc.  Long story short, no one will rent to you. It's 'illegal' and there are laws in a renters favor if they ever want you to leave and you don't want too.   The sooner you let go on the desire to rent or think you you should need too. They faster you will be happier with the lifestyle.  If you really want to give some one money to live, you are taking about rv parks.  My advice is to understand that you don't have to pay rent to be happy. Just continue to be consumer ever once is a while to help the economy since you can afford too. (If you can)"
vandwellers,3ccqmn,cookieguy10,2,Mon Jul 6 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I guess I haven't completely come around to feeling totally 'entitled' to the lifestyle and would feel more grounded knowing that I don't have to constantly move around, worry about safety or leo, etc. But at the end of the day those are the trade offs and probably inflated fears.

I've asked people to set up a tent on their land before while on a bicycle trip and they're always welcoming. I think the important part is being presentable and having a feel good story. If you look and act like a loser, people won't want to help you. I don't anticipate having any difficulty in the coming months/years.   However, you are looking for a long term place to park. That could make it more difficult as that becomes more onerous on the landowner rather than just doing a favor for a traveller. I'd imagine my advice still applies to this though."
vandwellers,3ccqmn,Solarnynja,2,Mon Jul 6 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"September 18, 2015 will be my one year anniversary for vandwelling. I live on Oahu and on this island, it's different than the mainland. We don't have RV parks. We don't have RV's. It's like they're illegal or something. I never see them. I see plenty of vandwellers though. I've been parking in front of friends house in maximum stealth mode. Not that I have to be, but I do it anyway. I'd really like to find someone with property in a rural setting that would let me park my van and set up an off grid solar powered van camp for a monthly fee. I'd like to park my van and set up an awning and maybe a hammock. I don't need showers or kitchen I just want a place where I don't have to be stealth and I can get creative with it and have fun with it. Stealth gets old. The ironic thing about my situation is I don't have to vandwell. I make enough money to rent a place. But rent is expensive and the scary part about renting to me is the lease. The commitment to a rental unit that over a year's time will cost $18,000. So in a rental situation I don't get to test drive before I buy. Who would buy an $18,000 car without feeling it out first?  That's not how rentals work. The way it works is you look at it for 5 minutes and have to decide right then and there if you want to sign the lease without know how fucked up much of it can be. Loud neighbors.  The dog across the street that barks all the time. The bus route that goes in front of your new house that stops, then beeps and plays a loud message to the hard of hearing what route number it is twice per hour until midnite. The 7am Sunday morning lawn crew with leaf blowers. I've encountered all of that stuff. I've had altercations. I can't sign on the line without knowing that my $18,000  for years rent is going to be a perfect scenario. It never is."

He and a few others replied and he had the best deal for $300/mo. water, electric and wi-fi.   I lived in a friend's side-yard for a few months too.

What are you going to do about body rigidity? Your van has a full frame, which is good, but a lot of the rigidity in the body itself comes from the roof. Also, there's cross beams in the roof that are important for body rigidity. On my ford anyway.  What is going to go over the roof top tent when you are driving at highway speeds? Aren't you looking at something that was intended to not be on the roof while driving? You really dont want to get a hole ripped in your roof.

The best and only way to fix it is by changing every one of the addresses you gave out to people so they have the updated one. It is a pain but can't do much else.

vandwellers,3c65fu,crockett5,3,Sun Jul 5 17:17:42 2015 UTC,I have lived in a tent for as much as 60 days in a row. The biggest challenge for me is with organization. The amount of things you have in your tent is directly proportional to your comfort. Create a system where you know where things are so you are not having to reorganize and repack every time you look for something. When you shop for tents take this into account and try to think about general leisure time in the tent. Tents get hot in the midday sun. Maybe have a tarp and a chair in addition to a tent so you can relax outside and enjoy a breeze.
vandwellers,3c65fu,bicyclehobo,2,Mon Jul 6 12:46:37 2015 UTC,"Do you have a car or any kind of vehicle? There may be times that you need to sleep in your car due to extreme rain/wind, but otherwise tent living could work.   Get a couple tarps to line the bottom of the tent and as a ground cover. Research all the campsites in the area and see how long you can stay. Many are 14-21 days where I live. You may initially want to stay in campsites as you get the hang of this since they'll provide a water source and a place to have a fire to cook if you don't have a stove."

Here are some of the better brands:  (Best) Big Agnes (Good) MSR, Nemo, The North Face, Marmot (Budget, but still good) Kelty, REI, Sierra Designs  I see a lot of people buy Coleman, Ozark Trail, etc department store tents. It's possible to stay dry in these, but they weigh a ton, pack large, and simply aren't designed with high quality in mind."
vandwellers,3c65fu,jaecup,2,Sun Jul 5 21:59:08 2015 UTC,I think those are good tents if you're trying to backpack and more specifically ultralight. So maybe if your goal is to travel and camp yea but a Springbar or Kodiak tent is a much better long term solution for someone if they aren't on the move often. Those tents will hold up just about through any type of weather and give you much better options for year round camping.
vandwellers,3c65fu,axf7228,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:50:32 2015 UTC,Good thought. It won't be anything too long term but I certainly won't be packing it around much
vandwellers,3c65fu,jaecup,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"Those appear to be bulletproof. I would still rather have a four season tent that doesn't pack so large/heavy. I guess I don't see the benefit compared to a more modern, lightweight design."
vandwellers,3c65fu,axf7228,2,Mon Jul 6 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Livability plain and simple. I totally agree if you're going to be on the move often or you don't have a suitable car to transport then by all means go ultralight. But while a Big Agnes tent is like 3 pounds it's not going to give you a guarantee of it lasting because of how it's made to be so light. The other tents offer the options of being able to house cots, wall stoves for heat and fire(in your tent!), don't trap heat near as much in warmer months and you can stand in them. I say all this being a person who owns three ultralight tents and loves hiking. I wouldn't want one to be my permanent residence though."

vandwellers,3c65fu,jaecup,2,Mon Jul 6 09:17:39 2015 UTC,"I personally have been living in my tent in the backtard of a friends place for 3 months now. I just bought my first van and I am sinking every paychecque into the build. As was mentioned before: how much shit you have is directly gonna effect tent life. I have my rucksack with everything in it and a milk crate with snacks (food and such I can use their fridge inside). Be ultra minimal, I have the luxuery of having a stable place where I am allowed to stay and a mattress to sleep on which is probably why I've enjoyed it so much, so far.   The issues I have had are all weather based of course, hunting down a sutble leak during a week of hard rain or not being able to be in my tent during the day 'cause it too hot (Living in Kelowna, BC...fuckin hot right now.) but the way I look at it some people have to mow their lawn or shovel snow and all I gotta do is dry out my shit every once and a while.  So my advice is basically be yourself, meet a cool friend and pitch them (hehe) the idea and see if it works out. I actually pay $100 to sue the house as my own which is a pretty damn good deal being able to wash myself and clothes, cook my food...etc"

What you need to do is look at if a lot of people started doing this as a viable alternative in numbers that could start making houses being used as much, which would lead to reduction in tax income. Of course, this probably would never actually happen (Everybody moving into vans and out of houses) but I was explaining the argument that is used often to pass laws that try to limit vehicle living.

As far as I'm concerned, the only reason someone like us would want to live in a rich neighborhood is to access the public resources that they often try to monopolize (beaches, mountains, etc). They're so used to brainwashed bottom-feeders drooling over their estates that they can't even comprehend the idea of people who genuinely don't give a fuck about wealth.

I suppose there is a lot of people out there that take advantage of the law and squat. It may be more of a prominent problem over there, who knows.  I suppose a country where tourism is a HUGE money maker the law may exist to help local business (example camper van rentals I am sure is a very popular business model over there).  It goes back to my point below though, fines aren't just handed out. Fines are normally handed out as a last resort after they assess a situation.   Trying to look at it from a police view. Go through the steps to get your vehicle up to code and you should be totally fine? It can't be that much more money, and in long run the amount of money you save it will pay its self off in no longer then two years."

I met a girl once who explained if better then I but it went something like this.  As you travel you meet so many people but you only spend a certain amount of time with them, you learn ways to connect deeply in a short amount of time but are you truly connecting? Friendship is seeing people change and grow, knowing someone for 5 years is a lot different then knowing someone for a month or so. After awhile you become that transient person that even your closest friends do not know anymore because you are never around.  I hear you on the informal dinners and meeting certain people who understand your lifestyle, that's exactly my point in the original rant about adapting towards your lifestyle. But what happens when family is in town or you want to raise a family, etc.  A lot of people are in it for the long run, some are in it as a transition as I was, some in just for the image, some just the experience. Living in a van takes knowing yourself completely, be honest with yourself and how things change.   I have made a lot of generalized statements but all of them are just from observations from my life. I spent a lot of time in art collectives and vegan collective houses, etc and these ""nomads"" for the most part are super self centered people. It was a real eye opener to the people who say are non judging but it's really to people who dress and act the same. Which I suppose that's how all aspects of life are. Generalities exist for a reason, it's human nature to group and categorize. Life would be way to overwhelming if we didn't."

It seems to me that travelers are less likely to be so imposing. If things get rough, they just ""get out of dodge"", right?  While a flighty traveler who you can't rely on may be unsettling and not someone to trust, I think it's funny you see that as selfish. Self-centered, maybe. But selfish implies a bit of harassment, taking advantage of, or at least imposing.  To me, expecting someone to hang around and help people and be more sociable is the selfish perspective. That would be imposing one's cultural expectations, ""social contract"", etc. on someone, without much regard for their own desires and beliefs."

If it's such an ""unfair transaction"" to people in the developing world, then why do they so eagerly encourage us to continue to do it? They might not be able to jump on a plane themselves, but how is people stopping visiting their countries and ""taking advantage of them"" by throwing tons of money at them going to change any of that?   ...there is a certain ego that comes attached with travel.   That's one way of looking at it. But the funny thing about ""ego"" is that those with the ego, when looking at someone who has dropped most if not all ego, seem to think the person without ego is more egotistical.  That is, they see people who lack concern for things people are usually concerned about, and it looks like they're operating from an entitled mindset. When in reality they don't care about xyz issue not because they think it's below them or something, but because they aren't attached to it as most ""normal"" people might be.

One I want to use for a 12v refrigerator while the other I want to use to charge my laptops or run other smaller items from it. The cooker I want to run off the starter battery via powerful DC current so it can cook fast and strong.  I found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPtBYg6N29E  So it looks like it is possible (Running induction cooker off Solar power pannel DC current. No inverter, No battery.) So it looks like it can be made to run off DC. The question is... how to do it from a battery instead of a direct line off solar pannels?

vandwellers,3c4ufe,Sehc,2,Sun Jul 5 16:36:26 2015 UTC,"Depending on what voltage the induction cooker runs on, you'd almost be best to use the high voltage pack rather than the 12V. Mind you it's at a rather dangerous voltage.   The way induction cookers/computers/most electronics work is by first rectifying the AC coming in to DC and then inverting it back to a high frequency AC to drive its transformers. As a result the induction cooker would expect say 170VDC for 120VAC supply or 340VDC for a 240VAC supply.   Most power supplies have a voltage range (or are universal) which means they might be able to run directly from the leafs HV. Only thing is you have to modify the cooker and deal with high voltages. It almost certainly won't work on 12VDC without an inverter."

vandwellers,3c0gv6,RageLife,3,Fri Jul 3 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"What's the approximate cost of this setup? You're living my dream, I just need to know how much to save up."
vandwellers,3c0gv6,robshookphoto,8,Fri Jul 3 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"I paid around 19k for the rig (loan) and about 3k for the bike. Seems like a lot but it only had 4,500 miles and sold new for about 70k. It was a little more than I wanted to pay but so worth it."
vandwellers,3c0gv6,deevil_knievel,4,Fri Jul 3 20:03:50 2015 UTC,"Nice, do you do a lot of camping or park up at Walmart a lot?   Also is this your regular home?"
vandwellers,3c0gv6,HellrosePlace,6,Fri Jul 3 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"I don't prefer Walmarts, but will do it in a pinch. I try to stay out of cities and camp in more rural areas. If I am i the city I check the local laws for car camping and generally just park on the street if I can. I live in this about 90% of the year."
vandwellers,3c0gv6,CJ-Johnson,3,Fri Jul 3 20:14:30 2015 UTC,Any hints for rural spots? I'e got a sprinter that can't be distinguished from a work truck unless you're 9 feet tall.
vandwellers,3c0gv6,Wildernasty,3,Sat Jul 4 02:31:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, where not to park? I try to stay close to somewhere with a shittwe for the morning and cell phone or wifi. Other than that I just look for a ncie pretty spot."

I also carry my bike but on the back of my van. I'm interested in mounting it up front. How did you mount your carrier up front?  Edit: i now see that it's a chinook.
vandwellers,3c0gv6,tramster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:30:28 2015 UTC,"Its a Chinook, actually. I bought it with very minimal use, was practically brand new! I carry the bike in the front because the main access door to the cabin is located in the back of the camper. I found a front hitch online for the ford econoline van for about $100 and installed it myself. Took me maybe 1-2 hours."

As much as I dream of a smaller van conversion, a small RV like that would be a very comfortable place to live while journeying across the country.   If you're comfortable sharing, can I ask what you do for a career that allows you to live in it 90% of the time, as you mentioned below? I'm always interested in hearing how people mesh work, finances, and vehicle living/travelling, since this is perhaps the biggest hurdle I'll have to eventually overcome."

vandwellers,3c0gv6,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:20:38 2015 UTC,The main difference is the amount of weight it can handle/carry. I previously had a '80 Dolphin that the rear end crapped out on me due to over loading. I would just get your rig weighed at a truckstop to see where you are at when fully loaded. Reference that with your GVWR for the rear axle and that should help you decide if you need to beef up that axle.
vandwellers,3c225q,iminmyboxers,6,Sat Jul 4 01:11:09 2015 UTC,Keep in touch with old friends and go to things like music festivals to make new ones. People with houses dig the RVs and people with RVs understand your experiences.

He drove out to both vans on my schedule and gave them both a good rundown. He was eager to help and did a good job too because he was just starting to try and break out in that line of business. I'm saying this because if you're like me going into this and not knowing anything about Cars to start. Then any somewhat knowledgeable opinion is worth it. Even if the guy is more of a hobbiest than a pro. This is especially true if you're just deciding between two vehicles and want to know just in general which is a better buy.  Anyway this response is somewhat unwarranted...just throwing out my two cents. A 'just some guy', while not being as immediately reputable as a mechanic shop might turn out to be more flexible and attentive to your individual case as well as cheaper"

That's also leaving enough floor space for someone to sleep on a narrow mattress. My interior dimensions are 14 feet by 5'10"". I.e. I have lots of extra space. Look at vandogtraveller.com (and buy his ebook) - I'd say that's about the smallest one can go with a shower. His is 18 feet long I believe - mine is 22 or 23. There aren't vans like his in the US, but you could get a raised top contractors van maybe.  I'm doing everything myself, but the van was $4600 and conversion will be about $5k when done."

vandwellers,3c1rkz,Bigfrostynugs,2,Sat Jul 4 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"I'd advise renting before buying, to check out layouts and how they fit you.      Pay attention to how you use your toilet at home.  where are your knees?  As you move around, where do they go?  How do you bend?  How do you stand?  When people try to fit a toilet into an RV or van, they often don't leave room for full range of motion.  People buy RVs specifically so they'll have their own private restroom, but then (often!) find that the layout of the restroom doesn't work for their body/habits.    Are you sure you want a van? A lot of people prefer travel trailers, so they can park 'em and have a vehicle free to roam around: jeeps, station wagons, small trucks: there are plenty of vehicles that are plenty beefy to haul a small travel trailer."

I know when you're driving you've got to be able to see two mirrors, either driver's side and rear-view or driver's side and passenger side.  Three is nice, two is the law.    I think that when you're driving, most places have laws that the front window can't have much tint and the front passenger and driver's side windows can be tinted but only to a certain percentage.    On the back window and back passenger windows, you can block them completely as long as you still have your two mirrors.    And, I think that when you're parked you can block them all.  You might want to do this in a stealthy way.  Minivan2016's suggestion of removable cardboard cutouts the exact size of the side windows sounds good.   And just a regular sunshade like you'd get at walmart (maybe with a bit of modification to be sure no one can see through any gaps) would be best for the front.... just an ordinary parked car, nothing to draw attention...."

In the UK but you have to do a whole new license test if your vehicle is over 3500kg, as far as I can see from google a Luton is a 3500kg van with a payload or around 1000kg, so I wouldn't want to be in it with all my luggage and get put on a weigh bridge if they are On A standard license. There was me paranoid by my wood cladding!

vandwellers,3bvp7j,Jailbreaktonight,3,Thu Jul 2 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"The other thing is the DVLA won't recognise a motorhome conversion unless it fits certain criteria, one of the many is to have a window in each side, which it doesn't have, so it will still be classed as a commercial or something else ( I'm not sure what a Luton would be, I know mine is still a panel van on the docs as even though it has the windows, it's considered a panel van) which makes insurance a minefield, I have mine insured as a private use van with modifications, but I doubt I'd be covered for much over the cost of my van in an accident or breakin. They say they spent 6k on the conversion but if it's insured as a van not a motorhome they will be risking not being covered for any of the modifications, just the initial cost of the van. I am learning all this slowly as I only recently bought my van and didn't realise how complex it all is when it comes to insurance. Last thing I'd want is national newspaper articles on my van if it's not fully legal in insurance terms, weight, or protected by insurance in all the proper ways.

I then went to curtain wire which works well because it's thin, springy (so won't sag) and cheap.  I went round the inside looking for hooking points that I could use. I found some like where the sun visor goes. This did work well, and it's lasted me a long time. But again I found it wastes a fair bit of space and also lets light bleed through the top and bottom.

The tank costs around $100 to fill and takes me between 350-400 miles when I'm on the highway. It's expensive of course, but I have no rent payment, so that's the trade-off.  The van itself was $3000. I probably could have bartered a bit, but honestly this was the most perfect possible van on the planet. Whoever owned it before was obviously using it for something similar. The back seat which folds into my bed was already present, as was all the wood paneling and the insulation behind it. There's even a spot to hook up to an external source of power.  Beyond that, each other thing was right around $125-$150. Each panel, each battery (two 114 Amp Hour batteries), the inverter, and the ceiling vent, so that was all probably right around $800 total. As a gamer, I likely consume more power than most. Other vandwellers I've seen on youtube get away with about half of what I've got, so just one panel and one battery.

vandwellers,3bt3jl,crod242,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"Np, just keep in mind you are already running quite a bit on your batteries. Typically 200w of solar and 200 amp hrs of battery will keep a 12v fridge going with some extra power here and there for lights and so on..  However with your computer, microwave, game system and so on.. You would need to expand a bit IMO."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"Is it possible to run a 12v fridge and maybe charge a laptop off of battery alone without an extra power source like solar?   I'm just looking for something to keep things cool for road trips / camping, and not to do any massive overhaul to my vehicle's electrical system."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,Vantographer,3,Thu Jul 2 06:27:01 2015 UTC,"I think you would have to do a lot of driving to keep the batteries charged if you were running a fridge 24/7. As for charging a laptop that's not as bad. I used to charge my laptop off my main battery, by just plugging in the charger anytime I drove somewhere."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,sfacets,2,Thu Jul 2 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"you can get a TEC mini fridge (thermal electric cooler). they basically drop the temp inside 30 degrees at best but it'd be enough to keep your drinks cold, you won't be making any ice. They don't burn as much power and they're super cheap. generally you can buy one for about $125CAD. For most picnic style applications in regular cars without their own backup power system this is the option to go for.  Important to note, it's a cooler, not a fridge. So I wouldn't count on it to keep your milk from spoiling, but I would use it to keep my beers cold."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,Vantographer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:12:45 2015 UTC,I've heard good things about converting chest freezers as well - the top-opening door helps keep the cool in.
vandwellers,3bt3jl,TheUtomjording,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah and TEC coolers don't have to be level, so you can lay them on their side no probs."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"A compressor fridge draws very little, mine takes around 2 amps. So 200 Ah in a sunny climate or daily driving shouldn't be a problem."

vandwellers,3bt3jl,L8sho,3,Thu Jul 2 14:41:32 2015 UTC,thanks for sharing your setup! When you panned to the game and tv setup I was like wtf...nice man. You sound happy and content
vandwellers,3bt3jl,L8sho,3,Thu Jul 2 00:12:41 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone. Just wanted to thank you all for the kind words about my van! Also, the first chapter of my adventure is up -  Steven Wilson - From Anaheim to Seattle.  I've created my own subreddit for the purposes of documenting my adventure for anyone who'd like to follow along (r/hellabryanstyle). I might create a proper website to use instead eventually, but honestly reddit is free which is a damn good price and it's easy which is a convenient level of difficulty, so we'll see."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,Amoral_Batman,2,Thu Jul 2 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"Two questions, if you don't mind:   How well does the microwave work with that inverter, and how much does it discharge the batteries to run it for like 5 minutes? How tall are you? (in regards to sleeping sideways)."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,kybishop,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"The microwave will only work when the batteries are super full and producing enough voltage to handle the drop that occurs when I turn it on. I never run it for 5 minutes straight though. But! We could do math! It's a 700 watt microwave, so dividing that by the voltage (12), we get ~58 amps. So running the microwave for an hour would take about a quarter of my whole battery bank. We only need 5 minutes, so we'll divide by 12 again and get roughly 5 amp-hours, providing I actually know what I'm talking about. Which I'm hoping I do; I did just take a class on this shit.  As for my height, I am 6' even, and I can just barely stretch completely out horizontally."
vandwellers,3bt3jl,Fwob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers. I am getting close to doing an Econoline build.   While I am also capable of doing the math, I like to hear of real world results. What sometimes works on paper doesn't work in real life due to the inefficiencies of the equipment involved.  Thanks for the reply and happy vanning!"
vandwellers,3bt3jl,Vantographer,2,Thu Jul 2 17:35:58 2015 UTC,Hi Bryan that looks like a great van and sweet setup.
vandwellers,3bt3jl,stehekin,2,Thu Jul 2 02:49:35 2015 UTC,You had me at super smash bros. Nice van dude!
vandwellers,3btifc,martyrdub,3,Thu Jul 2 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"One issue with the Astro is it's not very tall inside.. If you think about going that route, make sure to check one out and see how low the ceiling is.  Try to find a car lot with a lot of vans or maybe a u pull it style junk yard and go check out the diffrent vans to see how they feel inside."
vandwellers,3btifc,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:11:44 2015 UTC,"Oh man, the junk yard idea is genius. Thanks for the tip!"
vandwellers,3btifc,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yea it's what I did, when I was thinking of doing something other than a vanagon. I was really considering an AWD Astro, until I saw one at the junk yard and realized how low they are inside."
vandwellers,3btifc,thyusername,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking about going with the AWD Astro, I love going up to the snow. But at that point the gas milage would probably be about the same as a chevy or ford full size van. I'll have to go give them a look this weekend to check out that height. Just checked out your van btw, beautiful work man. Hows that fridge working out for you?"
vandwellers,3btifc,crockett5,3,Thu Jul 2 04:11:20 2015 UTC,"Just note that the 4.3 is notorious for needing the intake gasket done, which is a pain in the arse in the S-10 pickup (done two myself) the Astro will probably call for extreme patience.  As far as awd GM did make them in the fullsize 1500 2003-2014 only but you probably won't find one dirt cheap, I've been watching for one on and off since I found out they made them, the awd are never cheap and most you stumble upon will be super expensive conversions as in interior the awd is factory, every time an awd cargo pops on ebay it goes for nuts money https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNP-xLK4EA"
vandwellers,3btifc,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip on the intake gasket, thats exactly the kind of stuff I want to learn. I've seen those awd 1500's, I'd love to get my hands on one of those but like you said they are a little out of my price range. I do love the snow but I'm probably just going to settle for a 2wd and some nice tires with a set of chains."
vandwellers,3btifc,Nephthyzz,2,Thu Jul 2 07:14:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the fridge and my solar system is working great. The meter I bought is a little confusing to figure out, so eventually I'll likely replace it with the same trimetric meter I had in my first van, but other than that it's all working fine.  As for AWD, Chevy/GMC also make AWD versions of the full size vans. They are a little harder to find vs the AWD astro but not too bad. They just tend to still be a little more pricey though."
vandwellers,3btifc,Nephthyzz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"Nice, glad to hear its working out well! I think looking at the pictures of your build was the first time I realized it would probably not be possible to just pop my dorm fridge in my van and call it a day. A sad realization but I'm glad I caught it, haha.   Yeah, Ideally the dream for me would be to have an awd diesel van (or a syncro or westy :P), but I think I'm gonna have to settle for something older and 2wd if I ever wanna get this project moving."
vandwellers,3btifc,Nephthyzz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"2wd and a bit of ground clearance will get you a lot of places. Like if you get a 3/4 or 1 ton van they will usually have better ground clearance than a 150. Also the 1 ton vans usually have full floater rear ends which help a lot off road.  Ive never even had a 4wd, this syncro project will be my first one after its finished but I still go down moutian roads or off road in general. I just tend to get out and check bad spits out before going forward."
vandwellers,3btifc,Nephthyzz,3,Thu Jul 2 21:42:51 2015 UTC,I have been converting an AWD GMC Safari cargo in my spare time and the roof really isn't too high and I am 6 foot so standing is not even close to being an option. I don't live in my van so its not exactly a problem for me though. Since it is smaller you will have to get a little bit more crafty with storage space and what you feel like is a necessity. The thing I don't like about my Safari (2000) is the roof rack options. It doesn't have rain gutters so I would have to drill holes to mount one.
vandwellers,3btifc,investtherestpls,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome on the conversion, do you have any pictures I could check out? -- Yeah I am also 6'2 so I don't really see standing as an option either unless I get a sprinter (out of my price range) or something with a conversion top. The rain gutters is a real hassle, but I guess if your already going to cut holes for a roof vent and solar whats a couple more holes in the roof? :P I really like the idea of the Astro/Safari for the size and gas milage, but the more I look at them the more I'm unsure if that extra couple MPG5 and that somewhat easier parking is work the lack of space :/"

Most people in the united states can't use public transport, so things like purchase price, insurance, gas and maintenance are still going to be a part of the budget."

Mr 23 is incorrect in implying that property only means real estate.  California, for example, includes a tax of 2% of value along with the annual vehicle registration.  If your van could be considered an RV, some counties tax them similarly to private airplanes, or boats."

Longer term get a camp stove, basic cooking utensils and a bin for it all. A little pocket for grocery bags so you can prevent trash buildup (happens way faster than you think in those small spaces.

vandwellers,3bp6r3,plaanet,6,Wed Jul 1 12:24:11 2015 UTC,Make sure to get really confident and learn before you take it full time. Boats can be tricky until you get used to them.
vandwellers,3bp6r3,lshiva,6,Wed Jul 1 02:09:20 2015 UTC,This comment about living on boats made /r/BestOf a few days ago.
vandwellers,3bp6r3,bo4tdude,3,Wed Jul 1 12:27:18 2015 UTC,"In the US there is something called the great loop where people go along the gulf coast around Florida back up the east coast then through the great lakes and down the Mississippi or other inland waterways back to the gulf. Most of it can be done in inland waterways along the coast and only a couple of stretches require you to enter blue-water. There are also guide books out there that tell you where the good anchorages are and what towns/docks have good access to grocery/laundry.    There are loads of good boats from the 70s-80s that are still seaworthy and can be bought for <$10k. Something 27ft or larger would have a liveable kitchen, bathroom and bedroom below deck, although they usually have limited amenities in this price range. I think that most boats are built much better than what you would get with a commercial RV. Lots of solid wood fiberglass and stainless steel. None of the flimsy foam-board and flowery wallpaper you find on land.  Most of the cheesy expressions about boats relate to the pleasure boat owners who use the boat once or twice a month and pay to keep it at the local yacht club. Boats do have a lot of systems like an RV so there is more to break. Boat mechanics can get expensive fast. Also as the boat gets bigger the equipment becomes more specialized and expensive. One unique piece of maintenance is that the hull has to be repainted every couple years with antifouling paint to keep the barnacles off and prevent osmosis of water into the hull. You also replace all of the anodes when the boat is out.  while not cheap its something that you can plan on and can be delayed for a bit if needed.   Piloting a boat takes far more skill than driving a van. If you screw up, things get expensive/deadly very quick. Just getting stuck on a sandbar can cost thousands of dollars to have someone come and pull you free. Loosing an engine or making a navigational mistake will put you on the rocks. I would recommend taking an intro to sailing/boating class to see what it is all about."
vandwellers,3bp6r3,bo4tdude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:06:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information! This wouldn't be to quite some time and for a few months I'd likely go out every couple days or so with someone who knows what they are doing. I wouldnt think about living and sailing without know what I'm doing of course. I would think that the expenses wouldn't add up enough to be as expensive as rent for a fancy appartment or mortgage on a housre though, so if I make decent enough money I feel like that won't be a huge issue, but getting stuck on a sandbar or something is definitely a huge fear."
vandwellers,3bp6r3,notpayingbillslikeu,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:38:44 2015 UTC,Another option would be to just have a boat that is purely a house and not really functional. Then you would just pay slip fees to keep it tied up somewhere.   There are a ton of blogs about liveaboard lifestyle.

There are lots of pithy quotes about it but they come from people who have a house and a boat and work full time.  They're definitely cheaper than maintaining a house.  Edit: also, there's value. A house can be considered an investment because they generally appreciate, sometimes dramatically. Boats depreciate, as a rule.   But a house's appreciation certainly won't outpace its upkeep, so work or money or renters need to be part of the equation to make it a worthwhile investment, and I don't see that as significantly different than a boat."

vandwellers,3bnclw,canada_rv,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds like a bad inverter.  2 gauge should be way more than enough (I'm only using 4 gauge for my cabin), and a cell phone charger doesn't use very much."

vandwellers,3bnclw,canada_rv,3,Tue Jun 30 21:10:26 2015 UTC,You might also want to get a 12 volt-to-USB charger for your cell phone.  That might be more efficient that running a large inverter with almost no load.

Getting closer to festival season so it would be nice to have something for the blender etc.  One of these days I'll have to get a transfer switch or something so I can power the outlets within my campervan(currently only able to use them via shore power)
vandwellers,3bnclw,voidqk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Hook it up with short fat cables, and put a load on it.  Do you have an electric heater, toaster, hair dryer,  etc. that you could plug into it?  Jumper cables might work to hook it up, depending on the type of terminals that the inverter has.  (Of course, be sure to get the polarity right)"
vandwellers,3bnclw,cookieguy10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"Without seeing it I couldn't say, but from what you've said it could be   Inverter running from charge controller or battery, is your inverter running through the charge controller 'load' connection? If it is, disconnect it and run it direct from the battery. Charge controllers aren't designed to have massive loads running through them, it will fry it.   Lack of power, if your batteries are flat, but the panels are trickling into them, this could make the inverter get peaks of voltage that are sucked up instantly, causing the low voltage protection to kick in and out, or if your panels are connected to the battery terminal at the same location as the inverter then it could be a similar scenario. Attach your panels to one side of your battery terminals, and your load to the other side of the terminals so they aren't touching (solar ""+"" connected to 12 o clock, load ""+"" connected to 6 o clock on the + terminal, and the same on ""-"" terminal) (make sense?)solar panels pump out ~19v you want that going into the battery, not into your load. I'm not sure if it is true or not, but I've always done that to be cautious.   Temperature, is your inverter getting too hot? I've got a 1000w inverter that runs fine for hours, but when I run a jigsaw or angle grinder from it, it will cut out for a few mins to protect itself from overheating.   Wrong cables, inverters need short fat cables connected directly to the battery. shorter and fatter the better. You'll get voltage drop over long cables.   Can you take it out and try it on a different battery, or try someone else's inverter on your battery, maybe get a multimeter and check voltages across the circuit.   Beyond that, chuck it away and get a new one!"
vandwellers,3bnclw,cookieguy10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"My inverter is 1500w -- but that is a little deceptive.  In the manual, it says it can only sustain 1500w for about an hour before over-heating.  If it starts to overheat, it has fans that turn on... if it gets too hot, it will shut off completely for safety reasons.  Maybe that is what's happening with yours."

vandwellers,3bnclw,axf7228,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:59:05 2015 UTC,You can't hook solar panels directly from panel to inverter. It needs to be solar panels > charge controller > batteries > inverter

vandwellers,3bmsw7,voidqk,3,Tue Jun 30 14:10:40 2015 UTC,Where'd you install your fan? How close is it to the ventilation hole? Are you pushing or pulling air?  Sometimes I crack my rear doors open enough to allow more air in while remaining locked. But most of the time air comes in through a cracked window up front. On hot days I crack both the front windows and my rear doors.  You can always light a cigarette or something to see how the air flows around your interior.
vandwellers,3bmsw7,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"Fan is in the front, far from the vent (10 feet away, length of the body).

vandwellers,3bmsw7,cookieguy10,2,Tue Jun 30 17:20:18 2015 UTC,Air needs a in and out to flow otherwise it gets trapped. I have seen videos where they will suck air through a floor vent fan and have a second  van up high to suck hot air out  Remember that all the hot air is near the ceiling of the rig
vandwellers,3bmsw7,_Phreedom,2,Tue Jun 30 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"You mentioned a Fantastic Fan, is it an interior fan or is it cut into the ceiling? For proper ventilation and air turn-over, you need an air intake and exhaust. An optimum setup would be a Fantastic fan in the ceiling for exhaust and leaving your front windows cracked for air intake.   Exhausting air creates a slightly negative air pressure inside the vehicle which will cause air to get sucked in through the cracked front windows. If you don't have the front windows cracked, the fan will struggle to move air."

I just bought the stand-alone fan-tastic fan (dc powered), which I am going to put in front of the vent, to blow more air into the van... then have the ceiling fan-tastic fan blow air out the top.  I'm hoping that will help."
vandwellers,3bmsw7,_Phreedom,3,Wed Jul 1 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"Technically, running a roof fan and leaving your front windows down about an inch should provide adequate air turnover of at least several times per hour. I'm not sure why you are having issues."

vandwellers,3bjdw2,_and_seek,2,Mon Jun 29 18:32:27 2015 UTC,Experience of many show that 100% synthetics will leak like mad used in a higher millage older engine that had not been using synthetic from new.
vandwellers,3bjdw2,Sehc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with 10w40. Just stick with a major brand. Don't use 100% synthetics, but blends are ok."
vandwellers,3bjdw2,Sehc,2,Mon Jun 29 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"Why not 100% synthetics? I've used them in the past in VW cars, and they worked well. Would domestic engines not do so well? Or is it just a cost/benefit thing? I would expect a 400ci to need much more oil, and probably burn it faster, is that why?"
vandwellers,3bjdw2,shaggy99,2,Mon Jun 29 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"Synthetic oil did not really exist when that vehicle was made, so it is not designed to run it."

vandwellers,3bjdw2,mattchenzo,3,Mon Jun 29 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"On really old engines that used paper based gaskets. Switching from regular to synthetic, those will start to leak. I think this applies to pre 70's but don't quote me."

vandwellers,3bjdw2,mattchenzo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:35:08 2015 UTC,Does anybody know if it has rollers or flat-tappets? That's about the only thing makes a huge difference.
vandwellers,3bjdw2,zeppobob,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know, is there anything I can look for that would indicate that?  The van itself is an 85, but the engine isn't necessarily. All I know about it is that it has about 150k miles on it. Looks like a synthetic blend is the way to go though."
vandwellers,3bjdw2,zeppobob,2,Tue Jun 30 02:08:00 2015 UTC,"The difference is how the intake/exhaust valves are engaged. Almost all newer cars have rollers and don't need curtain chemicals that make the oil bond/stick to metal. These are the new eco oils. Older, especially American, cars lack rollers and the cam hits a smooth surface called the bucket. These have a lot more friction, which was just fine because we used oil to counter this. Put the new eco oil in an old engine and you get premature wear.  Option 1: Do a lot of googling of your motor. Ask the guy you bought it from. Key words, flat-tappet, cam bucket system, rollers, valves.  Option 2: Play it safe with Mobile 1 10W-40 high mileage synthetic. This has the most ZDDP (the bonding agent) out every oil I've tested.  Option 3: Run whatever oil for a bit. A few months of anything won't do any harm. Then go to blackstone-labs.com and get an oil analysis kit to find out if the oil you're running is up to snuff and a general health check on the motor Itself.  FYI I'm not affiliated with anyone. Just been racing cars for a bit."

vandwellers,3bjdw2,axf7228,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"I have always been skeptical of blends. It seems to me that when we bring our used oil in for recycling, its getting filtered, refined, and resold as a blend. I highly doubt that the used regular and used synthetic oil are getting separated from one another.   Regarding synthetics, they cause your rubber seals to slightly swell, so once you use synthetic it is never a good idea to switch back to dinosaur oil. Always continue to use what has been used in the past for that particular engine."
vandwellers,3bjdw2,Sehc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"That is not what I referred to as blend. I meant all new conventional oil with some synthetic. All the major brands make this, usually called special for high millage engines. But not recycled oil, all new."
vandwellers,3bjdw2,axf7228,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"I know what you meant, I'm just speculating that a blend is possibly recycled, blended regular and synthetic oil.

vandwellers,3bhkme,nixsee,9,Mon Jun 29 09:38:38 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Unless you find a way to get a class B and a campground with plug-ins so you can keep them air conditioned. Leaving them in a hot metal box even for a few hours isn't right.
vandwellers,3bhkme,fluxofapathy,7,Mon Jun 29 09:46:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. This style of living requires giving up a lot of life's luxuries. OP, you can't expect to continue on seamlessly without any compromises. If you're really keen to van dwell, it's non-negotiable that you'll have to ditch the cats. Find them a good home and get new ones if you ever move back into a permanent dwelling. I know you have an attachment to them, but they're just cats... These particular ones can't be that special."
vandwellers,3bhkme,nixsee,-1,Mon Jun 29 09:59:03 2015 UTC,"My circumstances are what's driving me to vandwelling. I have nowhere else to go. None of my friends or family are able to let me stay with them. I'm losing my house, and I live on SSI. There are plenty of people who vandwell with pets, even cats. I just want to know how they do it."
vandwellers,3bhkme,crockett5,8,Mon Jun 29 12:46:26 2015 UTC,"Most of those people you see with dogs or cats in their vans are stuck staying with their vans most of the time. They aren't going off and leaving their pets in their vans for hours at a time.  It gets way too hot in the summer time inside a closed up van for a cat to survive. Why don't you roll up all your windows and go sit in your van for a bit in 90 degree weather.. You aren't gonna last long and neither will any pet. Even if you aren't in direct sunlight.  People that have pets like that doing vandwelling are staying at their vans so they can keep the windows open for good ventilation.  I'd love a dog, but I know it's not feasible, because I have to work parts of the year and there is no way I could leave a dog locked up in a van for 8 hours a day.."
vandwellers,3bhkme,nixsee,7,Mon Jun 29 14:05:09 2015 UTC,"Just searched around. It looks like people tend to put them in some sort of pet/dog crate, or leash them inside. Some cats are content, others don't like it. They also walk them on leashes.   None of this seems like a fair situation for the cat. A home where they can roam is much better.   Your situation is unfortunate, but you'll get through it. Out of love for the cats, you should find someone to adopt them while you get back on your feet. Could you live with them in a van? Probably. But it's just not fair to them."

vandwellers,3bhkme,kimadagem,6,Mon Jun 29 12:45:26 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree that this isn't going to be a good situation for the cats; in fact, it might be dangerous - actually life-threatening - to them if the heat builds up. Yes, you could leave the windows open, but will that cool the van down enough? And besides the risk of the windows' getting smashed there is also the chance that the cats could get out (cat sees something, instinct kicks in and he goes after it), or that people could get in and steal your stuff or just vandalize the van.  I know how important the cats are to you; I've lived with a cat myself and felt the same way. That's why I think it might be a better idea for you to go to your local housing group and see if they can set you up with something. You say you don't have anywhere else to go; that makes me think you can't afford the rent on a apartment, and if your income is low you may be able to qualify for subsidized housing. I haven't had to do that (at least not yet :) ) so I don't know how it works but I think it's worth a shot. I don't know much about Olympia but it seems like it would be big enough to have services like that, and it's also the state capital, isn't it? Which means there might be other agencies headquartered there that could help. Get in touch with them and explain your situation, see what they can do. And if you haven't already, see what else you might be able to qualify for, like Food Stamps, Medicaid, etc; maybe the money you save with that could go to better housing. It's just a thought.  One other thing: There is another sub here that also might be able to help, called /r/homeless. It might be worth asking over there; maybe if there's someone from your area they could give more specific suggestions.  Good luck."
vandwellers,3bhkme,nixsee,4,Mon Jun 29 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, Olympia is the capital, but the services are pretty much maxed out. I'm on the waiting list for Section 8, but it's supposed to be another year and a half. I have food stamps, I have Medicaid/Medicare, and I have SSI.

Then you could spend the hotter part of the day at a shady park with your kitties. If you absolutely HAVE to be away from the van in the heat of the day, go out to the van every hour and check on them, you could turn the AC on for a while. (People who smoke often take smoke breaks - you'd just be taking a CAT break!). I think if you change your lifestyle a little, and think out of the box, you could make it work. ALWAYS PARK IN THE SHADE!!!  Of course it depends on the kitty's personalities too. They'll do better if they are already indoor cats. Love can overcome a lot problems: if it's that important to you to keep them with you, you can make it work. If they love you, they will be happy just being with you."

They especially might have trouble with cats (in a public place) because some people are allergic to them. And keeping a cat in a carrier for any length of time - well, it depends on the cat certainly but many just don't have the patience for that and will start making noise, which means that they might bother other people, plus they could defeat any efforts to sneak them into anyplace."
vandwellers,3bhkme,cookieguy10,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think you'll definitely need some form of active cooling, and not just good fans.  If you'll be able to connect to 120V AC power while parked, it will be pretty easy to run an AC to cool your van.  But if you can't rely on AC power (and presumably can't run a generator), then you'll need to use battery or solar+battery power.  Vans don't generally have enough surface area to run an AC directly with solar, even with a super-efficient 12V one and good insulation (in part because you need to park in the sun which counteracts the cooling), so you'll probably need a huge bank of batteries to keep things going.  But maybe you could make something work with this pet air conditioner: http://www.securepets.com/climateright.html, or this tractor trailer cab AC: http://www.arcticbreeze-truckac.com?"

vandwellers,3bhkme,tensacross,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:27:19 2015 UTC,"The only good option is to spend a good amount of money to be able to hook up a cooling device within the van. This either means a large battery/solar system to keep it around 75-80 degrees inside the van (preferably lower), or find a way  to hook up to an electrical outlet.  Either way, you MUST cool that thing down if you live with cats. Cats generally require a bit warmer temperature than humans (humans are comfortably between 60 and 80 degrees, cats are generally between 70 and 90), but keeping it at 90+ all the time can kill them. If you really want to bring your cats, this is the only option."

Second, I purchased my second van from the Akron/Canton area and ended up selling it because of rust issues. It will be worth your time long term to travel south some to find a van, even if it's in southern Ohio it will probably be in better shape.

I dunno how many miles are on your Chevy, but I can almost bet you the 90's mileage is not a low as you think, because it doesn't have the 6th digit on the odometer meaning you have no idea how many times it's flipped.  You don't need to spend a fortune to build out your van. Build out your basic bed and slowly add to it if you need to. Use some plastic bins if you have to or find an old dresser off CL and screw it to the inside of the van if you have too.

All that is about $5k if I do it myself.  My username is actually a climbing reference unassociated with the city. But I have spent a good bit of time in Colorado and should be heading back that way sometime later this summer. If you're sticking around I'll be in touch for sure."
vandwellers,3bfw5u,crockett5,2,Mon Jun 29 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, a high top will cost you.. But really the other stuff can be done reasonably. Example, stove/propane tank. It's nice to have a built in system, but you are looking at $300 or more for a under van mounted system. I had that on my last Westy and I agree it was nice..  My new van.. I use a single burner butane stove I bought at Walmart for $19 bucks.  What I'm getting at, is what you can get used to vs what you want can be a big stretch apart. I can say with out certain, the best thing that happened to me for vandwelling, was using my Tacoma truck with just a topper and a foam pad for my first summer.  Doing that, showed me I didn't need most of what I thought I had to have. My new van, yea I have solar, a 12v fridge, TV but hell I just literally added the drain for my sink today. I still haven't hooked up running water, but I now have most of the things to finish it off. Meaning you can build out the basic interior shell and add stuff as you go along."

vandwellers,3bfw5u,ShawnS4363,3,Mon Jun 29 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much new income you'll have coming in. If you have future money then just live with the Chevy as is and continue building it slowly. If you've already reached the end of what you're willing to spend then sure downgrade to the ford.   I don't know what the price difference is between the two is. But keep in mind that you'll be paying a premium on the ford for it already being converted and you'll be taking a hit on the Chevy for it being an incomplete build. Also youll be paying more/sooner on repairs and maintenance on the ford seeing as it has a decade more of driving under its belt already.  If I were in your situation I'd just stick with the Chevy... in reality though, given our most likely very different financial situations. I'd sell the Chevy. Take 14k buy a ""new"" van and pimp it out for 4k total and then cruise on the rest B-)"

I'm not sure what the power conversion is with the kinds of electric motors electric vehicles use, but I used to work on some diesel generators that could continuously produce 5kw and run non-stop burning about 1/2 a gallon an hour.  Having something like that and having it kick on whenever the battery dropped to like 20 percent would be awesome. Then you can just park out in the middle of no-where and be set.  I'd love it."

It was originally based on a small pickup truck introduced the previous year, also called the Delica, its name a contraction of the English language phrase Delivery car.  This truck, and a commercial van derived from it has received many names in export markets, being sold as the L300 (later L400) in Europe and New Zealand, Express and Starwagon in Australia, and plain Mitsubishi Van and Wagon in the US. The passenger car versions were known as Delica Star Wagon from 1979 until the 1994 introduction of the Delica Space Gear, which became simply Space Gear in Europe at least. The most recent version (not available as a commercial vehicle) is called the Delica D:5.

vandwellers,3b99g1,mostmodest-,5,Sat Jun 27 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"I just bought a van to do exactly that!  I purchased a 2006 Freightliner Sprinter made by Mercedes. Diesel. 5 cylinder. High top. 140 WB (fits in regular car slot at the parking lot). 3500.   No windows for me... Incognito is the name of the game.    From my experiences Toyotas abound in Central and South America. Seen quite a few Nissans too.  Perhaps it would be easiest to get parts for those should something break south of the borders. Both have great new vans, and handfuls of used vans around. I plan on taking a box full of necessaries and hard to finds. And if I get stranded and need to wait a while for a part, so be it, I will be fully self-contained.   I won't tell you which model to choose, as that should speak to your soul... But in my opinion diesel is the way to go, whatever brand you choose.  Generally everything is tougher in a diesel vehicle and more able to handle the rough and tumble roads found down there.  And a good diesel engine is only getting broken in at 100,000 miles.   Prior to the 2007 model year diesels were not equipped with the fancy and expensive Emissions control systems currently mandated by the U.S. Government.  Therefor older models should be able to handle the dirty diesel sometimes found in South America which has more sulfur in it. You can always purchase a DPF (diesel particulate filter) kill kit, but then your vehicle becomes illegal on at least USA roads.  I'd love to convert my van to four-wheel-drive, but that is an expensive mod. $8000, give or take, from my brief research.  During the dry season down south four-wheel-drive is not necessary. During the wet season four-wheel-drive is sometimes not even enough.  I just recently tore out the inside (it was a machine work van it its previous life), cleaned it up, and have begun insulating it. I plan to do a full build. Completely self-contained. I've got some photos that I'm turning into a build blog, and though it's not quite ready to go live, screw it.... http://seenamericalately.com/vanbuild  I don't have much experience with building cabinetry or wiring solar, but I'm going to do it. I do have lots of RV experience... been to 49 states, Canada and Mexico in my current and past RVs. If I need to hire some help, i.e. a cabinet maker, I will. Money well spent.  If you have absolutely zero experience building anything with tools, you may consider a factory conversion. There are a handful of really great conversions on the market already. Many older than 2007, diesel, and reasonable in price.  Most will be on a sprinter, ford or gmc. Search RVTrader, Craigslist (via SearchTempest or the like) and EBay.  That was my plan before I decided to build my own for the heck of it. No regrets yet, but I just started!"

Seems like it could be a pain getting it fixed south of the border.  http://drivetosouthamerica.com/preparation/car-choice/  I think your last suggestion is the way to go. Converting the van myself is going to be time consuming and expensive. I'm still not 100% that I'd even be comfortable living in a van full time, so I think that buying something cheap that I could easily resell makes the most sense for me.  I've checked out some Canadian autosale sites and I'm not seeing any conversions (unless a van that was built for camping/living in is what a conversion is haha).

To those asking about importing them: as others have said you couldn't bring in a brand new one for road use, but given that is is such an old design you could doubtless buy a pre-1990 one and import that. The Wikipedia article is unclear, but if you really wanted to retrofit ABS/PS/seatbelts(!) from the post-2011 models I think you probably could, don't appear to have been many changes over the years. I guess ideally you'd put a pre-1990 one for registering and driving and a wrecked post-2011 as a parts car in a shipping container, as well as whatever extra spares you can get your hands on, and get that sent over.   If you really wanted an all-new one, you could probably swap all the parts from a new van over onto an old frame (again, seems like they haven't made many changes over the years) and effectively get a new Bukhanka that can be registered and driven on US roads. AFAIK that's legal (as opposed to just swapping the VINs over, which is fraud and has led to people's cars being impounded and crushed), but I'd still probably import the old one and register it first, then do the swap, just to be safe.   They're cool as heck but it probably doesn't make much sense compared to other options, especially considering how unreliable the Soviet-made ones probably are."

vandwellers,3b8cep,nixsee,3,Fri Jun 26 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's just a bit frustrating spending the last 6 months build this damn thing, just to have something crazy like this a little over a week back on the road.  The worst part to me was my tire hitting the other car. They were very cool about it and invited me to their restaurant up in Estes if I make it that far. However I just really hate to cause someone else problems like that.  The other thing, is I was lucky it happened going up the mountian and not down. Had I been going down, I could of easily run off the road and ended up in the creek. Was a very big potential for something like this to be much, much worse. (When I say creek it's very fast moving whitewater and people die there from falling in)  On the plus side it was pretty damn fun riding my bike down the canyon road. I'd likely of never tried that with out this happening. Now I want to do it again.. Haha"
vandwellers,3b8cep,nixsee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:30:01 2015 UTC,Yeah certainly scary. I opted for a newer vehicle (2006 gmc savanal in hopes it would be more reliable than a vw relic.   Good luck with the rest of the trip!

I'm sort of committed to this one financially until I finish the full rebuild next winter.  My plan has always been to sell it next summer once the 4wd conversion is complete and the camper conversion is finished. The 4wd pop tops are just worth too much money for me to keep for doing this. Even as a converted van, it's worth a lot."

vandwellers,3b8v8q,JohnM420,8,Fri Jun 26 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"I have been vandwelling for almost a year. I have no tv. I have no refrigerator. I just have a bed and clothes along with various medicine cabinet items to stay hygienic. With me just existing in the van while I sleep and change clothes, I find the quarters to be very small. It's a sleep capsule so to speak. I work full time which keeps me away from the van at least 10 hours a day. Then I go to the gym and pump iron and take a shower. After that I find a dinner meal in the $10 range. I keep no food in the van because I feel it attracts roaches. For digital entertainment I have an IPhone 6 plus which I use for all things such as text/email/reddit/Netflix and so on. I don't need a tv or a refrigerator. When thinking vandwelling, think minimalist. I see other vandwellers out there who have over-accessorized their domicile and I cringe at the sight of all of their shit piled up in there and some even store shit on top as overflow storage. Just my two cents anyway"
vandwellers,3b8v8q,Solarnynja,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"same here.  I have a bed in my van and a cooler. that's all I need.  start small, stay small."
vandwellers,3b8v8q,tensacross,3,Mon Jul 6 07:49:24 2015 UTC,"You have to give up certain things for this lifestyle. It's sort of a give and take. With that in mind, certain things are doable but there is usually a significant dollar cost involved.  Things like fridges and TVs are doable.. I have a fridge in my van which I keep on 24/7. I'm also watching TV right this min with an HD antenna.   Microwaves, hot plates and PS3 start to get into the realm of too much to run on the same system unless you want to run a generator all the time.  Just to give you an idea, you will be spending around $1200 to $1500   On a solar system capable of running the fridge and TV.  Keep in mind you will need a 12v TV which will be about $100-200 if you are savvy and buy a cheap home Led TV which runs on 12v.  You will then need a 12v fridge and that will set you back another $500 to 700 depending on what you go with. Essentially you will be looking at close to $2k unless you are very lucky with finding some used items.  Some people claim success with propane fridges but then you need a propane tank and have to fill it all the time. Those fridges are still in the $500 to $700 realm.  When you start piling on all the other things, then it becomes unfeasible as sacrifices need to be made.   Unless you plan to just go sit long term in the same place, so you can run a $500 generator, then you will be forking out that $2k to get ""some"" of what you want.  Basically you are running everything off batteries, but you need a way to keep those batteries charged at a rate which our performs the amount you discharge them."

Well, it can be, but it's not going to be plain sailing. You'll have to sacrifice some luxuries and adapt your lifestyle. If you want a fridge and 24hr Playstation then you will have to invest in a decent amount of solar panels and 12v batteries, you'll need to understand how they work too. This will all be a huge learning curve along with so many things, so I'd start from the bottom up. Maybe get a smallish van first, build the basics (bed, kitchen area, storage) get used to that first, then get an idea of what you want and the layout you want. Your initial vision probably will be so different from your final design once you start living with it.  If you are going into this fresh, feel free to ask questions in this sub, I find it really helpful for brainstorming, I've even been persuaded into buying a fridge after 10 Years from these guys, now I need to redesign my kitchen!"

Solution, rewire or wire in another cigarette lighter somewhere else in the car/van/whatever END OF EDIT :) Wire w/ correct polarity or get someone who knows how to. 50w-75w are sometimes available on Tme for $1 res (be careful the shipping is often hiked up).   You have a double charging setup, with an audible/visible low battery warning so you might get a charging indication straight off that.  Charge it from outside your van that is, not from behind the windscreen. So you'll need a few metres of cable.  Keep an eye on your voltage and/or charge your gear while the sun is out.

I'm going to get an electric car and just use the car battery it is hooked up to the dc to dc converter of the main battery in the electric car and juices it up by 1800 watt per hour. Since the battery on electrics are huge I won't ever have to go to a library just a charging station from time to time. If I get the rav4 EV that thing recharges at 10k per hour which is hugely fast.

If you think that's gross it's really not, people throw out diapers and animal feces all the time. There's a variety of seats designed for 5gal buckets specifically for bathroom use."

When I've got to go, I just slide it out, do my business, and toss a few handfuls of peat moss and pine shavings in there and close 'er up.  Before the first use I put about an inch or so of the stuff in the bottom.  It only stinks for a few minutes and I pop a window and light some incense if I really want to.    I don't pee in it, and it's easy enough to find a bush or something to pee behind.    If it weren't for this, my quality of life would be much lower I think.

Unless your life is drastically different and you do something entirely 1000% new everyday. Or you eat something that messes up your body and get diarreah. Once you know when your body usually goes then you just make sure to add it to your routine. Also, don't hold it. It is very bad and just makes everything for your body worse including having to go. It is not when 'you' want to go but when your body tells 'you' to go. Same as when your body tells you to eat, or when it tells you to sleep (Ex: feeling sleepy, feeling hungry, feeling like you have to poo, feeling like you have to pee, etc) Just listen to your body. Treat it well and it will treat you well. I do it at the gym or at a public restaurant. I find it easy unless I a mat an entirely new place.

Right size to hold wet wipes, toilet paper, etc when not in use.  Also right size to tuck into storage area in the van. If we just plain couldn't get to one of the above, we'd line the pot with a plastic bag, take care of business, give the bag-top a spin and a knot (seal the smell in) and leave it in the pot with the lid on.

Any vehicle can break down, even if it's brand new. If you know what to do in the situation, you can save your own life or make the difference between a $200 repair and $4000 one.   There's no need to worry about the Toyota. Even with 245k it's likely to still have plenty of life left. With the money you save by not buying another vehicle you can afford to have a mechanic check it out (compression check, check the fluids for evidence of wear (metal shavings in the tranny fluid, contaminants in coolant, stuff like that) and also some tools, equipment and manuals to take with you on the road.  Also, be sure to have a roadside-service contract and a cellphone, as others have mentioned."

Well, not unless your truck is rocket-powered anyway, and I don't think any of them came that way from the factory. Did George Miller ever borrow the truck?  If you have any mechanic friends, ask them questions. Look up ""how a 4-cycle engine works"" or ""introduction to auto repair"" on the Duck. If you have a smartphone, get an OBD2 code reader and the relevant app to work it- otherwise you can get a stand-alone unit for around $200 at the parts store. Get a Chilton's or Haynes guide book for the truck (also available in ebook form, but I recommend the paper one so you don't get grease on your phone), put it on the back of the toilet and look through it when you poop. Learn the difference between metric and SAE tools, and get a basic set of the relevant type.  It's 2015. Auto repair is very popular. In the same amount of time it took to type ""I just do not know where to begin"" you could have typed ""how to begin in auto repair"" to your favorite search engine and begun. The important thing is to gather as much information and do as much preparation before you start. I've often found that just keeping a set of tools in the car makes it less likely to break down ☺"
vandwellers,3b3vvx,Minivan2016,2,Fri Jun 26 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Take the free truck for sure. There is a huge difference between broke down and junked. Get on some forums for Toyota trucks, there's forums for every vehicle now days and they get pretty specific. On those you can find common problem with your truck and fix or prepare for them before you head out. They usually have great diy sections with lots of pics. Lastly to check the health of the motor its self, if that goes your pretty screwed. Go to blackstone-labs.com and order an oil analysis kit. Follow the instructions and send it in with as much info as possible. Tell them what you plan on doing. They are great people and will give you very honest helpful info that will give you peace of mind or save you loads of money. All for around $20 last I checked. Best of luck."

vandwellers,3az3u5,Bigfrostynugs,4,Wed Jun 24 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"okay.  forgive me if this is old info.  You know you can park legally inside National Forest land, right?   Not even inside a campground, but just so you're within (?) 15 feet of, but not on, any forest road.    And you know you're in a spot that's got a LOT of national forest to your East and South, right?   Camping is limited to 28 days within a continuous 60-day period. Occupying any campsite for more than 14 days during this 60 day continuous period within 3 miles of previous campsite on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee Grassland is prohibited.  Developed campgrounds may not be used when posted closed. Developed reservation sites may not be used without a reservation, or permission from the campground attendant. Only designated group or oversized sites may be used by more than five people who are not all immediate family.  Quiet hours in campsites are between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. Please be considerate of others.  No camping is allowed within 100 feet of all lakes, streams and developed trails except for designated campsites and other areas as posted.     Yeah.  And I've read somewhere... i think in the fine print on one of their maps, that you have to be within 10-20 feet of the road or else it's considered ""wilderness"" camping, which has it's own set of (non-motorized!) rules.  Course, they'd have to find you, first.  ;)    This makes it a bit challenging to find parking, but not impossible.  Perseverance, right?  I've noticed that some trail heads have parking lots bigger than a 100 ft distance from them... so the farther parking spots would be legal, and yet close to the public restrooms that are at some trail heads.    here's a zoom-able map of the national forest land near your area.   Hopefully it'll help you scout a couple more good parking spots.  here's the link to their website if you want more info."

Large swaths on either side of the highway, while technically ""national forest"" are actually private land. Most forest service roads are blocked with gates, and the few that allow forest access are more like ATV trails (rough roads that I can't get the van down). I did find one spot, but it's about 25 minutes away and the road is barely passable in the van."

The same tank will leach less and less over time.  So age is on your side.  A carbon filter and/or UV will do a good job of removing most leachables.  As others pointed out, biological contamination is more of a concern.  I prefer to sterilize with hydrogen peroxide, but with concentrations greater than 5%.  That's more than what you can get at the drug store. Bleach or iodine will be the cheapest way to sterilize, but use a carbon filter after that since it may leave an aftertaste.  BPA is/was used in polycarbonate, which is probably not what your tank is made out of.  Ideally, you should drink out of glass, stainless steel, or copper containers.  New plastic containers are hit or miss."
vandwellers,3b0uxq,_GD5_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"Iodine and bleach work wonders, but is pretty bad for you to consume regularly. It kills the bacteria in the water but also the beneficial bacteria in your body."

I would not drink from the tank unless a true emergency. It is too easy and cheap enough to buy drinking water by the gallon jug. Use the tank for washing."

Basically a great portion of that I spent it renting a room in someone's place different people as issues would come up and I'd just move on to avoid drama. Would change places around 3-4 months. Then rented a studio for about a year or 2 that costed close to 1k. Then got a loan for a house and lost it when the eco crashed. returned to L.A. and rented a room in someone's place before renting an apt for 1.2k monthly. Was pretty expensive so I decided to add roommates about 2 or 3. That made a lot of issues. A lot of them. Rented like that for I think about 3 years. Then decided to move into an rv. I couldn't get much travel done so I got a car. That made me spent a lot of time driving between the rv and places I needed to go. In the end I settled for a van. Don't regret it.

Van builds take A LOT of TIME and MONEY, so I can see why he has it price just under $20k. Still a high price, but it is priced for a specific target buyer. Someone with disposable cash, but no time or maybe not enough expertise to do it themselves.  It's good to know about what my van may be worth when I decide to upgrade to something a bit bigger.

vandwellers,3aygqz,Bouncer827,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:38:38 2015 UTC,True lots of work went into it and I'm sure he didn't build it just sell it for a profit but IMHO someone dropping 15-20k is probably going to go for something with a bit more room.
vandwellers,3aygqz,PmMeYourWhatever,2,Thu Jun 25 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"I think 19,500 is a little steep, but it looks like a nice set up to get some ideas from."
vandwellers,3aygqz,redfoxsilverwolffang,3,Wed Jun 24 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that the price seems outrageous.  If he wanted to pull the premium price with those interior mods he should have done it to a new/better van.  75,000 miles isn't a ton, but it's still an awful lot.    Also, and more importantly with this sort of thing, he never mentioned why he is getting rid of it.  That's a big question mark from my point of view.  With most cars people can simply say they are upgrading, getting something newer/bigger/better and have to sell the old one.  This van has had a lot of work done to it.  The only way to justify getting rid of it for any good reason is that they upgraded to an actual rv.  Other than that it seems like he is just trying to dump his problems onto someone else.    Also, I know a lot of work has gone into this van, but that might not be a good thing.  Besides the fact that the guy could have done shoddy work, it's a lot easier to fix things you assemble yourself.  It's also part of the adventure, slowly adding on the things you need to your rig."

vandwellers,3az1vt,STICKSTICKITY,4,Wed Jun 24 17:24:07 2015 UTC,"Swinging doors definitely add more room for modification. I use mine for soft storage. I've seen people use them for small outdoor cooking areas, cabinet builds and the like. I'd say the main benefit of a slider is airflow, maybe?"
vandwellers,3az1vt,fluxofapathy,6,Wed Jun 24 18:21:59 2015 UTC,The sliders give more stealth but you lose outside wall space for mounting things and interior wall space for door clearance.  The double doors are better. and quieter to open and close.
vandwellers,3az1vt,monkeywelder,6,Wed Jun 24 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"Swinging doors can double as increased living space when camping. Just toss a tarp or some such over them for privacy, BAM! extra space. Also good for a shower stall."
vandwellers,3az1vt,kyonu,5,Wed Jun 24 21:39:37 2015 UTC,Swing doors are more sturdy and offer more customising options. But I wish I had a sliding door. A lot easier to open up and get in and out IMO.
vandwellers,3az1vt,zeppobob,4,Wed Jun 24 18:32:01 2015 UTC,I have sliding doors and I like the fact that your can park close to things. It also gives a nice big open port if you're getting in and out a lot. They also don't get blown by the wind which can be a problem.  As others have mentioned you lose basically all storage on the inside of the door.  They do look cool though.

As _Phreedom mentions changing the fluid can be bad, I disagree, but I do agree that have a flush done can be bad because it can it can knock blobs of gelated fluid loose and into the system plugging the channels and filter.  Also try googling your VIN, for help identifying which transmission you might have, variants are probably based off of platform (1500,2500,3500) and motor combo."

For transporting goods along roads i think biofuels is alot more practical and that all electric vehicles for the transportation of people isn’t the way to go for a sustainable future. Public transportation on a larger scale has a better roadmap to become 100% bio-friendly. As weird as it sounds i think public transportation and biofuels is the fastest way towards clean future. I know hippies gonna post stuff about not enough bio to fuel that demand etcetc, but batteries have the same problem and for some reason i think the biofuel demand is easier solved then the problem of advancing science towards superbatteries, chargers & motors within the next 25 years.  It could well be that all-electric cars/vans will not have a big impact on society in the near or far future as we thought it would today."

So far we haven't figured out a practical way to store that much energy electronically, but there's room to evolve the technology,  whereas biofuels can't grow out of that inherent limitation."

It almost seems impossible, biofuels doesn’t need us to change the way we transport ourselves to succeed. It just needs a solution to create enough of it somehow. From where i'm standing, this looks less hard to achieve that then changing the world. Most public transportation will be all electric i think (trains/monorails/trams/subway). So if i were mr. musk, i would put more of my money into public transportation that can be sold all over the world instead of cars ""The Joneses family"" cant afford in a lifetime. Oh well:)"

Use a better mattress. I've slept on an ""expensive"" air mattress for 4 months and it is not comparable to even a basic mattress.   Get some 2x4s and plywood and build storage benches/platform and put the bed on that. Have hinged or lift away lids to access things below.   The bikes could probably fit inside a vehicle that large. Or at least get a rear rack for the sake of fuel economy.   You're going to need something to store and prepare food. If it's just weekends, a cooler and camping stove could work. If not, you might want to look into secondary battery systems,12v fridge, etc...   Depending on where you will be, heating/cooling could be an issue. Roof vents are key for the summer, as are having some sort of screening to keep bugs out if you open doors/windows at night.   Van dwelling is a never ending project.

vandwellers,3am12f,battletux,2,Mon Jun 22 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"Nissan Vanette:       The Nissan Vanette is a van produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan Motors since 1978. The van has also been sold as the Nissan Sunny-Vanette or Nissan Van. There was formerly a separate model sold in Europe under the same name, however it was unrelated instead being based on the Nissan Serena. The passenger version is called the Vanette in most markets, and came equipped with multiple engine and drivetrain configurations.  2WD and 4WD versions were produced, with manual, automatic, floor and column shift options available. While no longer produced for the Japanese market, it was still available in other markets around the world such as Malaysia.  Production ended around 2010, eventually being replaced by the Nissan NV200.   Eventually, the car was replaced by a version of the Mazda Bongo (or E-series), sold as the Nissan Vanette under an OEM deal.

vandwellers,3aogpy,Settleforthep0p,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:58:17 2015 UTC,I didn't customize anything because I'm not handy. I prefer to leave the car or van I use as close to stock as possible.  So that means either buying an already customized van or a van and that didn't need a lot of modification.
vandwellers,3aogpy,abcocktail,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:31:47 2015 UTC,Economically I don't think vandwelling is different than any other lifestyle. You have  a job or some way of making money and you jus work everyday
vandwellers,3aogpy,abcocktail,2,Mon Jun 22 23:33:16 2015 UTC,"As for the ""supporting"" bit, try to land yourself in a contracting and/or freelance Audio position. Some websites like ELance or Freelancer.com sometimes have positions where they need audio or video of certain things, and that can help out. Unfortunately audio or production in general has a problem with vandwelling: It requires power. Power doesn't come cheaply. You'll need a decent sound system, solar power generation, etc. I think you should worry about that after figuring out the supportiveness of the lifestyle first, though."
vandwellers,3aogpy,kyonu,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:03:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! I certainly have looked into those websites and have found good things on them. As for power, I'm not too worried about that as my rig runs on two 8v batteries that can run all my equipment for around 30 hours. I'm mostly a bag mixer, and small batteries can power everything we need. In a pinch I can even use AA batteries if need be."

I'd avoid bug bombing the van because that stuff is pretty toxic and most people that bug bomb vehicles regret the raid all over their ceiling. Also if you're not into the trap you could just dust your vehicle floors with it.   Edit (additional stuffs): It's nontoxic, works by slicing insects up slowly until they dehydrate and die (though harmless to humans and animals). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth"
vandwellers,3al9bd,fluxofapathy,6,Sun Jun 21 09:12:28 2015 UTC,I second using diatomaceous earth. That stuff works really well on all kinds of crawling insects. It can take a couple weeks or more for all the roaches and the eggs that are already laid to die off. I would recommend using gloves and a dust mask when applying it.

vandwellers,3al9bd,alliOops,9,Sun Jun 21 22:10:20 2015 UTC,"I've heard some people have had success with this, although I have never personally had this problem:  Thoroughly clean the van, get rid of all food and water sources for the roaches. If you are in a hot enough climate, park in the sun all day with all the windows and ventilation closed. Try to get the temperature in your van as high as possible (make sure you remove anything that could be damaged by heat of course) - that should kill them off if you can get a high enough temp."

vandwellers,3al9bd,dragonbear,2,Sun Jun 21 12:43:19 2015 UTC,You could also let go of a couple gallons of gas to just let the engine run and cook the inside of the car with the heater if the sun isn't hot enough.

It's electrician work so picture copper wire, conduit, fittings, and so on. Each morning I fill my five gallon cooler up and take off for the day loaded with everything I need. Now at the end of an eight or ten hour work day I am still in possession of my company issued work vehicle which just happens to still have enough ice cold water left over for me to have plenty to make it through the night.

vandwellers,3akd6s,Solarnynja,-4,Sun Jun 21 15:34:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like this would lead to oversupplying the morning cooler to make sure some water is left over at the end of the day.  Then the same.  Electrical workers are more likely to steal copper and time.

vandwellers,3akd6s,CatchMeIfYouVAN,2,Sun Jun 21 01:35:10 2015 UTC,many gas stations have a spigot of some sort that you can get potable water from free of charge. worst case scenario drag em into a drug store or the like that has a water fountain. takes forever but is often filtered. usually a good idea to ask first before filling up large containers.

Just wait 'til you see a guy in the lot: ""hey, buddy, can I fill up this jug with water from that tap?""  He's probably a resident, and will probably say ""sure.""      Sometimes works if you see a person hand-watering, too.  ""Hey, I'm fresh out of water.  Would you be willing to fill this jug?  How about this one?""    for me, it's just about as handy to use multiple gallon jugs as a big jug.     If you have room/want, WalMart sells a 3 gallon jug of purified water.  Bring back your jug for re-fill.    If you've got money and worry, Walmart also sells in-hose water purification in the RV section... basically you put this filter between the tap and your tank or a fill hose, and it goes through carbon and other filtration to purify the water.  It just screws on with regular hose fittings.  They also sell potable-safe hoses, if you want to go that far.    If you're at a drive through and ask the clerk if they'll fill your gallon jug, they usually will."

vandwellers,3ahicj,nixsee,3,Sat Jun 20 06:35:07 2015 UTC,"I am in the early planning stages. Almost 30, just wasted a decade of my life. Never finished my degree. Highly specific hobby/technical knowledge in one area, but it's useless to have where im at (flyover). Im single with no real obligations or responsibility.   I value experiences over material wealth and work and save now. I have no long term goals, but plan to travel a few months in SEA next year. I have always focused on finding purpose in life but i never have found it.   I think this lifestyle is very attractive to people who want to save and travel. It's really freeing, at first glance at least.  The last time i was really excited in life was a couple years ago moving a thousand miles away with no one there i knew. It helped me better understand myself somewhat. Uncertainty can be good so long as a person is prepared.

I'm starting to wonder if this lifestyle attracts a group that falls under the following categories:     Young (enough) to physically afford this lifestyle Folks who are seeking for true happiness Folks who seek early financial independence    To share with you my story, I live in a big and growing city, rent prices are getting too high. Not that I can't afford it, but I asked myself, why am I pitching in so much money to rent a place I don't get to fully enjoy? Material wise, I have a convertible, I rent a 2 storey loft, and as I worked towards acquiring this lifestyle, I thought this would be happiness in my 20's. I'm in my mid-late 20's, haven't finished high school (diagnosed ADHD last year), had been living alone since 18, without much guidance in life (divorced family). I seek to develop character through this journey, and at the same time learn to live without all the fancy things I now have. I enjoyed the concept of minimalism and functional / practical designs in a camper van. The idea of being stealth also intrigues me very much. Learning to use available, and free resources and capitalize on it seems to be a smarter way to live. This will also allow me to afford my tuition to enter community college, and achieve a life long desire to complete post-secondary education. Thinking about the end result at the convocation, sharing a defining moment with my mother and friends, making them and myself proud is what I am hoping to gain from a lifestyle change.     Several quotes that struck me in the past couple of months of desperation and depression:    Your home is a very good representation of yourself. The things you own, end up owning you.    To everyone who still thinks I'm NSA, I'm simply seeking support and in return provide support to those who may be going on the same road. The hardest part I anticipate for is the adaptation, but to those who is reading this, please know that you are not alone in doing what it takes to achieve what is important to you and what defines you.

These are definitely cool pics and an interesting concept.  But even when I looked at just OP's pic, I think it's much more of a camper than a vandwelling.  When closed, the folding walls must take up a lot of space inside the 'van' portion; I'm just not sure how much room is left inside when the walls are up.  And when the walls are down, you're going to require a fairly large parking location (no way to be stealth here), plus there's really no way to economically heart or cool a structure that size without some kind of generator and some insulation that's going to bulk up the walls a bit.  I like the concept, but it's really something that you take on vacation with you, like those pop-up tent trailers or something.  Cool pics though!"

Since my next rig will be a box truck, I'm planning to replace the rear door with a ramp like an auto trailer or toyhauler. Then you just slap something like this on it:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002UC2RKM/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1434754692&sr=8-2&pi=AC_SY200_QL40&keywords=toy+hauler+patio&dpPl=1&dpID=31VqyeKlahL&ref=plSrch  I've also seen trucks for sale that already have a folding side wall, used for a stage. They're rare but not unheard of. It looks simple enough to fabricate but would take some engineering. If I can pull that off I'll just add a regular awning and one of these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B004RCSMDO/ref=pd_aw_sbs_263_6?refRID=0EZ9Z9XCK1F34ZN5ZJWW  I mean, those pictures are cool design porn, but like most design porn it doesn't strike me as very practical. That's a lot of fairly complex joinery, and having the fabric permanently over the structure makes me think it would wear through and tear in short order. Not to mention trying to clean all of that. And the few minutes that will be saved by the accordion design won't matter because you're not going to be in a hurry if you're expanding your whole camper anyways.  It also cuts down drastically on usable space if you can only walk on the inside foot or two of the platform.  In short, hell ya expando-van, but this looks like some impractical concept art college project from a design student, which is probably why it was the only one made.

They came standard on a few fifth wheels and they sold them as aftermarket additions. Basically a bed sized shelf that folds out of the wall with a tent, kinda like the accordion design actually. I think they stopped making them though and I can't find them. For some reason I thought it was Thermarest.   But ya, I've long been planning my custom ride, almost ready to start building it. I want everything to expand if I can pull it off. I don't have any links, but I've seen some crazy designs here on Reddit where you end up with like 4x the floor space. As long as it's a tent design and everything still functions when you're closed up in stealth mode, I'm all for it. That ramp porch thing I posted does fold up intact if you want. So you just drop down your rear ramp gate and have an instant extra room, pretty badass.   It's this kind of shit that got me into RVs when I was young, I just love the transformer / multitasker aspect."

But we can safely assume that one of the walls of the van/trailer would have to be cut off. Thats cheap enough. Then some welding would be needed as well, that can be pricy.  Then you would have to figure out some sort of locking mechanism.  And then there is the strengthening of the wall...  The transparent plastic (maybe heavy duty shrink wrap?) piece needs a foldable frame. I wonder if you could repurpose something for that part..

It was a mess to install, but is still bonded to the wall. On the other wall, ceiling and floor i used 2"" or 1.5"" foam panels with great stuff as ""glue"" to adhere to the wall. Also with the walls bring curved, that adds additional challenges to mounting a flat board. If I were doing it all over, I would use a two part spray foam. Run all your wiring first, and in conduit. There are diy kits, but you might be able to work a deal in with a foam installer since you could bring the van to them instead of the other way around. The direct bond with the wall also dramatically reduces noise over rigid foam panels.  I also built a front and rear bulkhead which are also insulated that ""box"" in the cargo area as much as possible.

I have friends that have slept in vehicles pissed as fuck, and the police don't care until you try to drive somewhere. Personally I don't drink much, my licence (also my liberty) means more to me that a few beers."

They saw that I was parked and not in the driver seat and that I have enjoyed a couple beers and they were more concerned about hardcore drugs and if I have a warrant than my beer.   I did not have any hardcore drugs I did not have any warrant. I continued drinking when the sheriff's left.   When you are drinking do not do anything to attract police ( protip)

Basically in my country, you can sit behind the wheel of a car with alcohol while the engine is running as long as the vehicle is standing still. You can't be drunk in public but drinking in public is fine. In that case, the only issue would be drinking or being drunk while actually driving, which is something that shouldn't ever happen anyway. So check the local laws I guess..  Also, alcohol takes 12 hours to get 50% out of your body, if you drink two beers at 8pm and have to get going at 8am you'll still have a full beer in your system."

Here are my thoughts  With the solar panels on my van, i am really not that stealthy anyway, so anyone who would think someone lives in it, would think the same if it was a high top. (this stealth reasoning also applies to windows, so i now plan to add one in the future)  Most of the time at home you are sitting.  It makes it a little harder to cook.   So is it worth it to drop the extra $$?  for my situation, spending the vast majority of my time at work, sleeping, or at the gym, no.  If you plan to use your van more like an RV, then yes.

I guess the idea of a pop top would be the same, you change your living area accordingly to your environment.

Standing is good for you as it stretches out the legs, but without the weight of your body, the stretching doesn't do much. So if you're snowed in or don't want to walk in the rain, laying down is your only option, which doesn't help much.  Plus, it's easier to shower if you have a shower, and less head-bumping when you walk into your van.  IMO, i'd do it. That's why I've thought about a mega-roof Sprinter or a high-roof Ford Transit since they are over 75"" tall inside. I'm 6'4."

vandwellers,3abdiy,CatchMeIfYouVAN,2,Fri Jun 19 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"So, parking under a carport or some kind of cover might be an issue?"
vandwellers,3abdiy,Eyeus,3,Fri Jun 19 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, it may be a problem. I've never owned a huge van, but some of the taller ones look like they would either be too big or cutting it very close. In that case, I guess you'd simply learn which parking lots are too short...worst case scenario maybe you back out when you see the height of the parking lot and find somewhere else to park."
vandwellers,3abdiy,tensacross,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as an example, I drive a 1990 VW Transporter. It's standard height and I just barely get into multi-level carparks, a hi-top would absolutely not happen."

vandwellers,3a7qdr,CapitanHarlcok,2,Thu Jun 18 14:21:00 2015 UTC,"Wtf? I've spent months traveling around Europe, I've been stopped by police in France, Spain, Portugal, had it pulled apart in Belgium, been woken up in the middle of the night and told to move on loads of times, van searched in Seville. But I've never had any trouble with regards to documents or anything. Converted sprinter, registered in UK as a panel van, insured as a van. There's literally thousands of converted vans all over Europe, always has been, always will. Go to a teknival and see how many converted vans and trucks go driving past the police with nothing happening to them. Europe is fine for driving round in a converted van, don't worry."

I just worry about the 'unimmagined fines' and all that legal legislation stuff/insurance/documents freaks me out. Don't understand why there is always so much shit around just getting a van and living in it... so simple but made so complicated. thanks
vandwellers,3a7qdr,nexe,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"lol sorry, the shower plate is not necessary, got dragged down on the thoughts of what I need to do, anyway the TEST is easy in Germany and Uk do not worry there is gonig to be an expert that will check your work and if done right your OK if not you will have a period of time to get the work done by an expert of your choice, they will basically check the Van holes electric system and seatbelts and make you drive it around and see how it goes and make you do some sudden brakes to see if the stuff stays in place. As suggested do this in GERMANY or UK since they have looser laws.  I will try to be very clear here: Cargo Van is an N1 category vehicle(object transportation) RV or Camper ar N2 category(person transportaion) The test will make your n1 category vehicle usable has an n2 category  vehicle. That's all and if you need help manny RV sellers are polite enough to help you do it for free ;) while the cost of the test is around 100 bucks.  Turning back to WHY there are people at teknival that dont have the converiosn... well there are manny people that have a good campervan(whitout holes and an electric system that doesn't requiere you to drill the vehicle) is because they use an N1 vehicle and if they get stoped they say they are transporting that stuff, yes it is a bed and a dinette but it is totally legal to transport them ;) hope I helped better. here I can leave you this in english it is the thing you need to know for vehicle conversionin UK they will fit german needs aswell: http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vrt/vehicle-conversions.html  BTW: East europe are the countries  were you will have very few police controls(Belgium Romania Hungary)."

But i think as long as it is registered in uk and on my insurance as a camper then that will be accepted in europe too?
vandwellers,3a7qdr,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"If you get pulled over in Europe by the police they want to see your driving licence, v5 logbook, insurance, passport. If you have all those you are fine. You don't need an MOT in Europe, but it's a good extra document to shove in the mix if you get stopped. Although your insurance company will require you to have one to cover you so it's a good idea to get an MOT before crossing the channel. Making sure you are insured is a different matter, insurance companies are sneaky bastards, most will offer continental insurance for 30 or 90 days, but check your policy, they are good at fine print loopholes to get out of paying up.   In my experience, having a UK number plate, and a UK passport gives you an easier time with authorities abroad.  Ive found the gendarmarie in France are worst to deal with, always up for a pick around to see if they can fine you for something stupid like not having a triangle, my friend got held at gunpoint by one of those fucks when we broke down, they tried to charge us for recovery from the toll road and we told them to fuck off basically, it got heated, then my mate got thrown against the van at gunpoint! we didn't budge, after a while they agreed to send the charges to my UK breakdown company, I'm sure it was a scam, but I dunno really, never heard anything back from it.   Portugal is the best place to van dwell, loads of park ups, super chilled police, friendly people, mountains, ocean, awesome surf, lakes, forests, plains, decent weather, it's got it all!"

vandwellers,3a270s,bookfancier69,3,Tue Jun 16 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"This.   You can screw as many as you want around each window, and sew the same amount on the curtains. They are strong enough to hold up a thick curtain flush to the wall to block out light. Velcro is shit, it wears out and gets full of fluff after a while."
vandwellers,3a270s,acid_clown,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:57:52 2015 UTC,Ah good to know. I was wondering if velcro would be a good option... then recall how it gets full of fluff.  So button snaps are the way to go. Great! How would you approach this upon passenger and driver side windows? Still just screw them into the frame? What about those suckers for the windows? Do they work? I''m basically moving into a geo metro and I need to block  off the windows on the driver and passenger so they don't see me all strewn across the space pod... err... car ! >>
vandwellers,3a270s,Minivan2016,2,Thu Jun 18 01:58:42 2015 UTC,i just sprayed the insides of my windows with plasti-dip and was done with it.
vandwellers,3a270s,Just_Todd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea. Here's my curtain saga. I built a small camping trailer, but had the exact same issues you are all dealing with.  I mounted roller blinds horizontally and let the tension hold it taut.  It was ok, but the vinyl eventually sagged. http://i.imgur.com/RiIG9l.jpg  If you attempted to just hang curtains vertically, due to the sloping walls of a vehicle, you lose a really large amount of room in a space where inches count. I then got button snaps as others have suggested, and custom sewed a cover with snaps for each window... again it was just ok... the buttons get damaged, or if you don't punch them in perfectly it seemed to ruin the snap and it never held very well. Finally, the solution that has worked VERY well over the last few years ended up being covering the inside of the darkly tinted windows with white shelf paper. From the outside, the windows just look darkly tinted.  On the inside the majority but not all of the light is blocked and it's obviously private. Here's the build journal which I haven't updated in a long time.  http://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=45827"
vandwellers,3a270s,ohbugger,2,Fri Jun 19 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"Fellow MPV dweller here  I knew I wanted blackout, so I ordered some blackout blind material, black on the outside for stealth, white on the inside to reflect light.  Like you I tried velcro, but it was just too messy and hassle, as well as the question of where to store it. It also didn't stick too well.  I then went to curtain wire which works well because it's thin, springy (so won't sag) and cheap.  I went round the inside looking for hooking points that I could use. I found some like where the sun visor goes. This did work well, and it's lasted me a long time. But again like you I found it wastes a fair bit of space and also lets light bleed through the top and bottom.  So I'm now on a new solution - drilling small holes in the doors to get a custom position that's tight against the window. The curtain's just the right shape, stays in place and most importantly, blocks out light fantastically: imgur"
vandwellers,3a270s,kenbw2,2,Tue Jun 16 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't installed them yet, but I bought 100 small Neodymium  magnets from amazon. Technically 2 should be able to hold them up, but I plan on putting 2-3 per edge. My van has a raw metal edge around the windows, but they are strong enough for you to epoxy behind plastic trim. Then you just match up positions with magnets in small pockets on the curtains."

vandwellers,3a270s,fluxofapathy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:18:24 2015 UTC,The velcro that sticks to the van - added crazy glue to the sticky glue side on each one. The velcro that sticks to the curtain - added three staples to each one.
vandwellers,3a270s,fluxofapathy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:38:50 2015 UTC,Is this something you've done with success?
vandwellers,3a270s,Sehc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:46:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the only thing that I could get to work after trial and error with industrial velcro. The sticky back is just weak and melts away when the heat starts rising, so in order to secure it to the cloth I used staples and the crazy glue. For the velcro on the actual vehicle I just used crazy glue on the sticky back side and It's been holding up well, despite humid hot weather here.   Also like you I was pretty upset when I found out that it would just melt away in the heat, so that's how I improvised."

If I am sleeping in a van, car, rv, sailboat, truck, train, home or even on a park bench and someone tbones it with a car there is pretty much no insurance company is going to say I shouldnt be sleep there. Im not going to pay.   Unless I was sleeping somewhere like in the middle of the street or on top of nuclear reactor (actually done that) but no car could get in there.

vandwellers,3a1dwy,Fu_Manchu_You,2,Wed Jun 17 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Here's some ideas, gleaned from personal experience:  All insurers have software that will immediately flag that van's VIN as a cutaway, i.e. box van/minibus, sight-unseen.  That's a no-go for personal auto insurance.  Some of them even distinguish between cargo and passenger van VINs & reject cargo vans.  Best bet to get that truck legitimately insured is a commercial auto policy.  Be a sole proprietor, handicrafts etc..., use it to travel to arts & craft shows, etc....  or whatever you do to support yourself.  It's reasonable, for instance, that an artist might sleep in her van from time to time to save on hotel costs.   Progressive commercial, in my experience, is pretty hassle-free.     Just say its a van , dont go telling people your plans for it.   Seconded. You'll have to fill out an app for coverage.  Don't lie or conceal; just don't volunteer more info that what is asked for."

Here you can see it goes metal roof > reflectix (glued to roof) > furring strip air gap > ceiling panel (coroplast). I wanted it to primarily retain internal heat during the winter. So the heat goes from my heater, through the coroplast, bounces off the reflectix, and then back into the air gap, right? Sounds good. But when it's hot outside does the reflectix transfer it straight off the roof and into my van? Would another layer of reflectix glued to the top of the coroplast ceiling help keep the heat from entering?"

I would say no, you should be fine. Review the first video, fast forward to 1:35 where he puts the foil on top of the skillet, then places his hand above the foil. Flip that whole thing upside down and imagine the skillet being your roof. According to what he's saying, the heat should not transfer unless something comes in direct contact with the foil. Because you are using furring strips, you should be fine. (as a side note, he seems responsive to questions on his youtube channel, I'm sure he'll answer if you ask)   I've been researching this for weeks because I want to get it right the first time (heat is a major concern for me).

Although, I could have used less furring strips or at least minimized their contact with the reflectix. Maybe next time.  Your approach sounds a lot like mine. I used FRP but looking back I'm fairly sure coroplast would have worked just as well. It's cheaper and far easier to install. Anyways, good luck going forward!  Also, why is this post ranked so low?

vandwellers,39yb82,Sehc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"On a very cold/warm night your idea would have the car starting every 10mins or so. It's not about electrical power.  It's the heat the engine generates that warms the water running to the heater matrix, which the fans run air across to warm it. It's not like a toaster that uses purely electricity to generate heat, it needs the engine's waste heat. The heater matrix will rapidly cool with cold air running over it - the matrix is designed to have a constant stream of warm water. Bear in mind if your engine is totally cold it could take 20mins at idle to get the water back up to temp. When it's switched off the small amount in the matrix will cool in minutes requiring the engine to restart - although the block will have likely retained a lot more heat than the now cool matrix. You can see this for yourself, stopping at a gas station on a cold night, knock the engine off but leave electrics on fan will run but by the time the driver gets back the heat out of the vents will be Luke warm at best, car starts up the vent air warm straight up because the block has still got most of its heat left.  Are you thinking car or van? If van a diesel night heater would solve the heating issue. They can run all night with very little battery impact just running a small pusher fan. They burn a tiny amount of diesel to get a heat exchanger warm. Get the place toasty warm and then knock off till the temp drops back down. They do basically what youre talking about but without starting the car/van engine. A non diesel van can run a seperate baby tank just for heater. Because it's designed for the purpose its miles more efficient  Similar story with a/c; most non-hybrid cars need the engine to be running to drive the compressor. I.e. It's not just electricity they need. The system will survive a while longer with the compression and temps than the heater matrix would but it's no going to be good for more than 20mins even if it was hooked up to an external power source.  I believe hybrid heating and cooling systems have been designed ground up to operate without combustion engine for extended periods. For the air con they have electrical compressors similar to motorhome/fridges compressors. Sure you could retro fit but you'd in for a battle. You'd be much safer off with a big bowl/block of ice and a cheap fan. Hybrids heaters work more like toasters with a fan too.  Don't know about you, but the car I was sleeping in starting and idling without a driver would have me awake and bolt upright."
vandwellers,39xx46,jaecup,4,Mon Jun 15 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a balancing act. But I think proper maintenance and care are more important in the end. A newer vehicle with a lot of miles but poor maintenance history might be a risky buy. But at the same time, abnormally low miles on an older vehicle can also indicate that it sat around for most of its life and may have been neglected.  My motorhome is a 1971 and it had 64k miles when I bought it. Runs great, never had an issue with the motor or suspension other than needing a good tune-up. But because of the age, I did have to reframe parts of the roof from water damage.  I came across a 1978 motorhome that only had 35k miles on it once. Great deal you might think, but it had severe water damage and didn't run because it had just sat around for years on end."
vandwellers,39xx46,brock1912,2,Tue Jun 16 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on where it's at. For example, a van in a very dry climate that ages 30 years may still be in perfect running order with little maintenance (as an example, spare me) versus a 15 year old van in a humid climate. The humid climate will cause a lot more rust which deteriorates a lot of the mechanisms that run the engine, causing problems.  Mileage on a vehicle is probably less important than the physical condition of the parts. As long as regular maintenance has been taken on both units, I'd say get the newer van because parts will be easier to find for longer periods of time."
vandwellers,39xx46,kyonu,2,Mon Jun 15 18:26:06 2015 UTC,Great response. If I were to go look at an older van are there any specific areas I should inspect for wear/rust that would indicate more possible mechanical problems?
vandwellers,39xx46,kyonu,3,Mon Jun 15 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"Everywhere. If it has rust on the frame/inside, then chances are there's rust in the engine.

vandwellers,39wt7l,Minivan2016,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"The ARB uses a Danfoss 12v conventional compressor. The only brand that I know of that uses a swing compressor is the Engel, but those start at $850+. The advantage to a swing compressor is that it doesn't require a higher startup current, but Engel still says it requires 33 watts to run. A swing motor is a linear motor, which means the moving part goes back and forth rather than around, so you don't need a crank to convert rotary motion to linear motion."
vandwellers,39wt7l,Dlichterman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was the one that was suggested. I'm going to move into an electric nissan leaf and I will be running a small fridge (I think it is a box cooler). I was suggested the Engel and a Xantrex PROWatt 2000 Inverter, 1.8k watts. The set up would be cables to start up battery (Hopefully getting a deep cycle AGM) connected to inverter and fridge plugged to inverter. Would you still suggest the ARB over an Engel? There seem to be so many fridges out there it is really hard to pick one. I think one with a compressor would be nice to keep things cold I'd also like to get an induction cooker that uses 1.3k watts. Likely unplugging the cooler when using it. What are your thoughts on that? The DC-DC converter on the leaf, I was told, dishes out 1.8k watts to recharge the batt when it is low."
vandwellers,39wt7l,4vox1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"The Engel has a reputation of better reliability than most, primarily because of that compressor, so that may be a better option for you if price is no object. I ran into the same thing you did, too many choices, but they ALL use similar compressors except the Engel, which I couldn't afford, so I went by price. I can buy almost three of my Waecos for one Engel, so you have to weigh that into your calculations too. They'll both cool equally well.  As for cooking, if you're sure your converter can handle that much power, I'd say go for it. Realize that running a 1.3k watt load for an hour, which granted is a long time to cook, is 1/16 of your range."

What are the chances of a regular compressor type fridge to die whille driving? Is it the movement that brings them early death? Do you believe 1.8k watts would be good enough for a fridge and induction cooker? What size wire would you suggest?

It's wider and longer than any van on the market.   I think the closest you would find would be a long sprinter but I don't think the sprinter will be as wide as that RV.  I am curious if he's running his projector and all that on solar alone. I guess if he doesn't run a 12v fridge he could have a decent amount of battery for that kinda stuff.

He has probably about 7 feet width in there bottom to top and he doesnt lose wall space to a 4 foot sliding door.  If I could get a real door to replace my slider I could get close to this.  But that 2 feet does make a difference. There is an Australian company that makes fiberglass door replacements for sprinters that bolt into the existing door hole.  I may at sometime try to do that.  Once I make the form I can sell them.

In order to get 50 hours of AC i would need 40 batteries connected in parallel that would prob cost 4k for the batteries at bulk prices, but at that volume of batteries space and weight really become a serious issue.   I guess i will have to go with plan B, which is a small Honda hydrocarbon generator mounted on the roof to generate electricity for the AC unit.

vandwellers,39wjzr,monkeywelder,2,Tue Jun 16 10:51:56 2015 UTC,"your math is based on steady state. another problem is the startup draw from the compressor.  A startup capacitor change will help. youll need to put a higher boost one in the unit so it charges slowly then when the compressor kicks, the load surge doesnt kill your power.  it will also increase your battery life.  You can find them on amazon. Read up on them,  they are easy to install if you have basic skills.  SOME ac units are d/c inverter internals for low draw (mostly mini-splits)  There may be window units that have that."

However, if my van was insulted, I'd like to think it would work better. I'd do it if I knew the insulation would work well enough to enable the DIY ice cooler/radiator to really work, but since I don't know and since nobody here has done this, I'm reluctant to spend the $$ for insulation.

vandwellers,39usp7,Van-van,2,Mon Jun 15 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"Insulation would slow down the heat transfer from outside into the van. Depending on how much the transfer was slowed, and if the van was already cool from running the main a/c, then it seems to me that it would be possible to keep the air cool with the ice cooler/radiator setup.   Whatever heat inside the van would be transferred into the cooler (melting the ice). Since there would be less heat at any given moment in the van due to the pre-cooled environment and the insulation, the ice should last longer. It's the ""how long will 10lbs of ice last under these conditions"" that I don't know. If it lasted a few hours, that would make it economically feasible, especially in areas where ice could be obtained free or cheap.  Is that what you mean by physics? I welcome any help because I'd really like for this to work, but if it's not possible then that sucks but at least I won't try a futile endeavor."
vandwellers,39usp7,outforsnacks,2,Mon Jun 15 04:35:11 2015 UTC,The problem is: Where would the humidity in the air go? More humidity in the air means it is going to feel hotter than it actually is.
vandwellers,39usp7,SpartanMonkey,2,Mon Jun 15 09:13:34 2015 UTC,"True, but this setup has a radiator, which means it's not one of those setups that just blows air over ice. That would increase the humidity. In my setup, the ice water is pumped into a radiator and a fan blows through the radiator which cools the air. There is condensation on the radiator but a drip tray below it feeds back into the cooler, so no humidity is added to the air."
vandwellers,39usp7,outforsnacks,2,Mon Jun 15 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"It can work but you're relying on the ""heat of fusion"" of water from the state change between a solid (ice) and liquid water to do the cooling. That's all well and good but the ""heat of fusion"" of water is a lot less efficient than the ""heat of vaporization"" from liquid to gas.  For reference, heat of fusion of water is 334 kJ/kg while heat of vaporization is 2,270 kJ/kg so relying on ice is way less efficient.  If you're in a hot humid area you should focus on cooling the body and not the van. Even in relatively high humidity soaking your TShirt and putting a fan directly on you will vaporize enough of the water to provide a strong cooling effect. Lots of ventilation in the van to let the added moisture out will be necessary. The internal van temp won't improve but the wet shirt will still help cool you which is what really counts."

vandwellers,39usp7,DIY_Vagabond,2,Mon Jun 15 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. How much does it reduce the temperature inside the van? Also, when you said it lasts 6 or 7 hours, what is the external temperature? Are you parked in the sun?"
vandwellers,39usp7,_Phreedom,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:55:47 2015 UTC,If your in front of it 15-20 degrees... My fan could be stronger. if it was with a bigger cooler the whole van...these are on 90 degree days. I am for the shade but sometimes get the sun
vandwellers,39usp7,DIY_Vagabond,4,Tue Jun 23 07:18:33 2015 UTC,"If you can, have 2 Fantastic fans instead of just one. The air flow it creates is actually pretty substantial (as long as the doors and windows are mostly shut). Having lived in an 31' Class C RV, it cooled it down by around 15 degrees on very hot days. For a unit that big, it must be pretty substantial for a smaller van. Have them as far apart as you can for it to suck up as much heat as you can."
vandwellers,39usp7,kyonu,3,Mon Jun 15 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"out in the heat of Aussie, i've often used the ""coolgardie safe"" method to cool cars/verandahs etc. basically you use some hessian to cover the window/door with the top of the hessian being in a trough of water (for a vehicle this is done by puttying up the gutter at the top of the windows...or an old wine sack filled with water and a few holes to leak water), the damp hessian hangs over the door/window and cools. google has some more variants"

Right now I have parked in a Family member's driveway and run a portable air conditioner through the night. During the day I work. Weekends remain a problem. I either hangout with friends, study in a starbucks, or spend a good amount of time at the gym.  There's no staying inside that van during the day. Texas humidity + heat = no bueno  If i didn't have family i would rent an rv spot for around $400, or I would advertise on Craigslist for a spot in someone's driveway."

Plus I don't really spend time in the van during the day.  During the week I work all day, then at night it cools off to a comfortable temp.  On the weekends, I find a spot near a beach and I set up camp so to speak.  I have a pop up tent, and hammock, and a folding chair that I arrange and spend the day hanging out.  Daytime in the van sucks.  it's a sleep only place for me."

Swamp coolers won't work and those cooler ice units are hard to deal with and results are not usually that good. I've found even in humid condition that Mission cooling towels can help but don't really make things comfortable just barely tolerable, staying hydrated and a fan is really all there is shade helps that and don't be in the van during the hot part of the day.

vandwellers,39usp7,No-Other-Way,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:11:13 2015 UTC,I lived in my van for two summers. One in Virginia and one in North Carolina. Park in the shade and spend time during the day somewhere else. At night is strip down next to nothing and have a fan an inch from my face. You get used to the heat pretty quick. Stay hydrated and you'll be fine.
vandwellers,39udw5,elkinsvented,7,Sun Jun 14 21:25:51 2015 UTC,The 1st thing is insulation. Get it in and covered.  You will need a battery to hold your solar power. Consider a portable setup to start with. Live in a bit and decide just how you want things before you make permanent changes.
vandwellers,39udw5,olfitz,2,Sun Jun 14 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"One thing to think about before you insulate is where you want to run your wiring for things like lights, power outlets, etc. You might want to run those wires behind the insulation first. As for the hole, I'm assuming you mean for the fan? I would think that would be a selling point for somebody using it for cargo as well, it would give them better air circulation."
vandwellers,39udw5,BigandStupid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"How hard is it to figure out wiring after insulation? Alternatively, what changes would I have to make to my plans to insulation to accommodate wiring?"
vandwellers,39udw5,BigandStupid,2,Sun Jun 14 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't with the insulation, but presumably you're going to put something over it right away, like paneling or some sort of wood. If not, never mind. But if you are, it's easier to run the wires under the paneling rather than having a bunch of wires showing afterwards."
vandwellers,39udw5,jack_o_all_trades,3,Mon Jun 15 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"General tip but I'll place it here. Use screws when possible instead of nails. Also, buy screws that use a square bit."

With a Phillips head (+) the point it goes to makes it easier to slip when the scree is held tight by the surface, meaning more and more rear pressure is needed to prevent it jumping out and running the +. The square ones act more like bolts. You only need to apply rotational force."

I then revert to normal sleeping schedule on my days off being I had 4 days off each week. This was during the summer in New England and I was sleeping in the back of my Tacoma with a contractors topper.

I was just thinking of renting it out for a bit as I used to always open my couch up to travellers (3 or so years ago before I lived in a van) and it was a great way to meet people. insurance/parking permit aren't free though so I thought I would charge a bit to cover it.  The nice thing about the film industry is I can work for 3/4 months and have time to take off and travel. I used to just park the van at studio/set and would have access to power, get my propane filled/tanks emptied for free, etc.  That was when I didn't have any responsibility though. Now I'm meeting with city representatives, seeing studio execs every day etc. scouting locations so I needed a reliable vehicle.   There is tons of opportunity for me to climb the ladder and I feel if I ever do become a director or another one of those untouchable positions I can easily go back to living in a van and no one would blink an eye.  I had this epiphany where instead of fighting the system the only way to change it or live your own way completely free within it is climb it, conform then divert. I find fighting the system off the bat is more effort then it's worth when trying to build my career."
vandwellers,39u29r,Minivan2016,2,Sun Jun 14 21:21:17 2015 UTC,"Renting it out isn't a bad idea but do you really want the hassle of worrying about it, if they're wrecking it, maintenance etc etc? My guess is the worry and headache wouldn't be worth the returns. Use it when you're traveling. Pocket per diem if you're able to. Use it as a backup for when the economy tanks. You'll always have a bed and a roof over your head; that gives you the freedom to take more risks and (hopefully) reap the rewards versus the guy with the mortgage and three kids that needs to take the steady safe choice at work."

I'm not so sure on the renting out bit. Only do it if you check with the city and also your local police department. Otherwise it will be a pain down the road, trust me. Just be sure to keep some money saved on the side incase everything goes tits up. At least enough to be able to buy a vehicle and go return to van/car dwelling.

As long as it's not a gated part pulling over for the night is no big deal.

vandwellers,39ohb2,180513,6,Sat Jun 13 06:18:00 2015 UTC,I like harbor freight inverters cause you can get a new one for free every two years.   Theyre disposable.  My friends and I use them on boats because Id much rather replace a cheap inverter every few years. than an expensive one.  The ocean will kill the expensive ones just as fast as the cheap ones.  I have two 2000w and a 300w for the same price as 2000w high end unit with the same failure rate.   If you go into that knowing the purpose of HF stuff and give it air flow it will be ok. And get the two year NQA return on it and in two years pull it and get a new one.
vandwellers,39ohb2,monkeywelder,2,Sat Jun 13 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"Will they exchange it if it burns out? The inverter came with the van, so I don't have any documentation on it.   I won't be using it too much, so I'm not too worried about, just don't want a fire on my hands."

I then promptly fried it like an idiot when I hooked it up. I looked at the battery saw the pos and neg posts then still hooked it up backwards somehow.....  I would of felt bad taking it back, for me being a dumb ass so I just ordered a new one. Got a 1200 the 2nd time."

vandwellers,39ohb2,Thermodrama,3,Sat Jun 13 08:53:45 2015 UTC,Thanks. If it just shuts down I might just try it   and see how it goes. I may be able to cut a vent so it gets some air flow.

Even worse, the unit does not shut off before the heat starts a fire.  Putting something that generates heat (the inverter) underneath the refrigerator is a bad idea.  The refrigerator will work harder to keep the food cool.  Put the hot thing above the cold thing (heated air rises).  TLDR: Don't put something that generates heat in a confined space."

vandwellers,39m1iw,Threpid,7,Fri Jun 12 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Quick google says seems to say about a 3-4 mpg loss when A/C is on. Average american drives 1200 miles per month. Average car in US gives 23.6 mpg. 1 Gallon of gas in L.A. is $3.50. 1200/23.6=50.8 Gals  50.83.50=177.8$  Now 1200/20.6=58.2 Gals 58.23.50=203.7$ for 3 mpg loss Alternatively 1200/19.6=61.2 Gals  61.2*3.50= 214.4$ for 4 mpg loss. That is a money loss of 25.9 to 36.6 USD MONTHLY with the AC. The question is..... How many MPG does he lose when driving with those plants? more than 3-4mpg?
vandwellers,39m1iw,Dynosmite,0,Fri Jun 12 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Man, I just think you're trying to force this a little much, its a cool idea but it really just doesn't seem feasible. I think there definitely would be at least 3mpg drop for this at least just from the soil required."

Because of the organic layers he added to the roof for the plants to grow in, and because the water is evaporating from those layers, it creates a passive cooler that chills the car.    But I bet the plants are pretty and a good advertisement for cooling alternatives."

vandwellers,39ich2,pooncartercash,3,Thu Jun 11 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"Don't get a mattress. Get a foam core mattress pad between 2inches thick and 4 inches thick.   The first two weeks I slept on my 2in foam mattress pad, it was a big rough. It was so comfy but kinda hurt my hip if I slept on my side. But once I got past those two weeks, I can't go back. Regular mattresses are just so uncomfortable compared to the foam now. Plus it's lightweight, rolls or folds up, easy to clean, and is only two inches thick, so takes up very little space.   For my SUV I have a 4in twin size foam core mattress pad that I found for free during bulk trash pickup, but probably would cost around $20 new. That is ridiculously comfortable, warm, but not as easy to move around as the 2in one.  Edit Look for them on craigslist.

vandwellers,39ihgj,Revolutionista,3,Fri Jun 12 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"Hellooo, I don't live in a van but I use a Toyota Prius to spend overnights in a suburb of Manhattan 1-2 times a week.  A lot of times when I have to pee, I just go ahead and do it, I hope this doesn't offend anyone, but Manhattan stinks of pee anyway.  Dogs, bums and even drunk nightclub goers just pee wherever.  I've even seen business men peeing in alleys.  Why should I have to be inconvenienced if they're not?  So, if I have to go and there is no bathroom handy, I open my driver's side door and my rear driver's side door and create a little ""stall"" that way so that passers by can't see me.  I wait till I can't see anyone coming, then carefully pee into the space between my car and the curb.  This obviously works better when wearing a skirt.  I keep a roll of toilet paper in the storage box between the driver and passenger front seats, and some baby wipes as well.  I dispose of the used baby wipes and toilet paper in a plastic ziplock and then throw it in the trash.  (Thankfully, Manhattan has plenty of trash cans.)   I have to have a lot of control or else pee might splash on my shoes with this method.  If it does, I use a baby wipe to clean them.  I've gotten good at this, though, so I haven't had any mishaps for a while.  I don't feel bad doing this, because shop and store owners tend to give you dirty looks in Manhattan if you use the bathroom but you're not buying anything.  Sometimes they even deny you use of the bathroom to try to force you to buy something.  Manhattan needs public restrooms like in a lot of other cities, but the city refuses to put them in.  The few that they have close really early.  Theres one on 32nd and 6th ave, and it closes very early and then a cop sits in front of it practically all night, just lurking around there I guess trying to catch people trying to break in there and use the bathroom.  So I really don't feel bad for peeing on Manhattan.  It's one of the most inhumane cities with the average price of an apartment well over $2500 a month, lots of vacant apartments, but 25,000 homeless children all in shelters.  So, pee on you, Manhattan!  Get some public restrooms!"

Haven't found a road in California it can't handle. Limo tint the rear windows, put up a sunshade and black curtains in the front, and you can sleep in downtown SF (I have, many times). I'm 6'1"" and fit comfortably. My body fits in the back with the seats down and my head goes on the armrest. It's really sweet because the Forester has a giant sunroof directly above the armrest, so if you're out in the natures you can stargaze at night and wake up with the sun. Any van is gonna need an additional battery to run your stuff. I took out the spare time to make a little pantry and mostly eat non-perishables, but you could conceivably put a bigass lithium battery in there. There's also room in the engine bay if you remove the bulky and pointless piece of plastic on the end of the intake and perhaps the ridiculously oversized wiper fluid reservoir. I would really recommend an ice chest and gas-powered kitchen though. Anything you need to keep cool should probably just be bought fresh in civilization a few days before you head out, and it'll stay cool surprisingly long with enough insulation. I'd consider it kind of a pain in the ass to put together an off-grid system with that kind of draw and the major constraints you're dealing with in a van or a wagon, and I'm building a satellite power system right now at work. But get something for the amp, for sure. If acoustic happens to be an option, I have a lot of fun with a baritone ukulele. It's like a mini guitar, but easier, and fun to play reggae on  :) These things are built to have the option for an aftermarket trailer hitch. I would be shocked if nobody's figured out how to get a dirtbike on the back of a Forester.   Think about it man! Vans are a luxury to a certain kind of person :) If you're planning on spending a lot of time out in the world and just using the car as a sleeping pod, I highly recommend the Forester or a similar AWD wagon."

You get better ground clearance, even with a 6 foot length bed you've got 6'5"" of bed length, you can get a camper top and use a riser to get more headroom so that you can easily sit up/move around in the back.  If you find one with the half back doors you could take out the rear seats and use that for kitchen area to keep a fridge/your battery pack in and maybe some extra storage for stuff that doesn't fit underneath your bed frame.  Trucks are less noticed then vans so it's more stealth in one sense but you have the disadvantage of having to exit your vehicle to get into the sleeping/main storage.  If you're going to be camping offroad then this really isn't that big of a deal.  You've also got the advantage of better aftermarket support for the vehicle if you're trying to do anything like a brushguard or winch it will be about a million times easier to find a bolt up solution then it would be for a van.  Go and see as many vehicles as you can, climb around in the back of them, move inbetween the seats, check the headroom, bring a tape measurer and get dimensions and see what it physically feels like in the back, figure out how you would build out that vehicle, where your bed will go, what you will have space for etc. etc.  Do all this before you actually start trying to buy."

vandwellers,39jgbu,HazyGaze,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"My original plan was for a cargo van, but I just bought a full size truck this week and will be adding a camper shell. In large part I agree with the logic of the other poster who also suggested looking at a pickup.  You might not need 4wd, but you can get it in a pickup much cheaper than a van, as there are many used 4wd pickups available. If you've looked at 4wd vans at all, you know this isn't the case.   A long bed (8') would probably be a better fit than regular, but then again I wouldn't want to be driving all that much in San Francisco with its poor turning radius. I'm sure it's doable, just a pain in the ass. There's always the option of mounting your bike on an external carrier, but if you're committed to bringing it inside, then 8' is mandatory, and you might have to go with a custom camper (Tradesman Trucktops and Bel-Air camper shells are two possibilities) to get sufficient height.  Engine access is easier on pickups, and from what I've seen there are larger online owner communities for pickups than vans. An exception is the Astro van which has a large group of devotees.  Where you intend to camp will dictate what you need to do for insulation. I plan on spending most of my time in the southwest with occasional trips to the north, mostly northwest, when the weather is good, so I'm not putting in any insulation. There's a lot of great builds out there, but consider how much skilled labor and time they required. Same goes for panelling, it's just too much work at my skill level to be worth doing. Here are a couple of builds that kept it very simple and didn't require craftsman level skills:  http://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/2u8zb0/ford_transit_connect_conversion_with_hammock/  http://www.cheaprvliving.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=10680  The floor storage / basement in the second thread looks pretty simple.

Most of the shells, or vans, I've seen with this kind of floor storage don't have more than a couple of vertical feet of living space."

Even if you want windows, it's nicer to be able to install actual RV style windows than to use a passenger van pop out style.  The other thing that you mention about security with the windows. I have the same thoughts. My vanagon has windows all the way around it. I've blocked off the two rear side windows, but I don't feel I could ever leave it at a trail head over right for example, because it's too easy for someone to smash a window and get inside."

The other day I was approached by a security guard when I parked at the bank to make a deposit. Questioned me if I was going to be bank and why? I confirmed that I was and such then asked why he wanted to know. Said something about me putting up that aluminum cover for the front window.

vandwellers,39imit,One_Awesome_Inch,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:41:33 2015 UTC,"th the trade.   I can relate though after loading up the van I basically can no longer see out the back windows. At first I could and I had been used to that while I had my sedan. However, after driving now like that for a while I can say that, at least for the rear windows, it is not needed. I can see well enough behind with the side mirrors. The windows on the side, specifically passenger side middle windows can be pretty useful in certain situations. Such as when making a turn in a busy intersection where you can't wait until all traffic has passed. As for the windows on the side behind the driver I only ever use it when switching lanes ONLY because I have not installed one of those little round mirrors sold at the auto shop. Not sure what they are called but they let you see that area when switching lanes. Though I have noticed that now a lot vans have split mirrors with the side mirrows are split in the middle and you can adjust one side to see far out to the side and one to see what is right next to your car.... Pretty useful  However, going back to the surveillance camera I'm sure one can be placed in such a way that when making a turn from one street onto another with heavy traffic that you are able to see far out to the side where incoming cars are coming. It would take some extra technical know how but I am sure it would be just as good as having passenger side windows. For the rear perhaps a nice rear view camera not the cheap ones from the auto maker but something you can pick and trust yourself. Those are my thoughts.....   I'd really like to have a set of cams that are stealth but let me see outside the van. Mainly because I'd like to see who is knocking on my van before I try peeking out the window or shades. I've had some gang banger encounters and having no windows would make me a little safer :P.   Truth be told I can't really enjoy the windows I have in the passenger van. There are always people around and for some reason they like to look inside. Not that it bothers me but what does is them calling a security guard who says I can't stay at a lot :(. On the street it is a little better just you can't do it where you are going to be sleeping later on. People get to recognize you quickly."

vandwellers,39gx02,pillowpants80,4,Thu Jun 11 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"For keeping cool at night in that sort of climate, ventilation will be key. Once the sun goes down you aren't really fighting the heat, just preventing your body/electronics from heating up stagnant air, and ventilation should take care of most of it.   For the daytime, the best thing you can do is stay in the shade. After that is going to be insulating the roof and sides. I never liked the idea of using bubble wrap, mainly due to it not being rated as a building material, but people have used it with happy results (and soft walls). If you can, rigid foam board is the best bulk option, at least 1 inch IMO. You can use denim/rockwool/fiberglass for more difficult areas and to plug gaps, but getting those impervious to vapor/moisture in a vehicle is almost impossible, but with ventilation, not a huge concern.   As far as other materials, Reflectix is great for blocking out windows, but doesn't do much when pressed against the metal wall or between pieces of interior board and insulation. Technically, reflectix and foil faced boards are vapor barriers, but how you edge them might not be. One easy option is get a water heater blanket, one side is like foil, the other loose/soft fibers. This can be an easy way to fill the gaps between the exterior wall and rigid insulation.   I grew up in the southwest, and given shade and ventilation/breeze I don't freak out too much."
vandwellers,39gx02,crockett5,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"With this in mind, what I did with my reflectix was allow the gab between the out side body panel and the inner supports be my air gap. I left that space open to act as an air gap with the reflectix laid across that. I then used the 3M foam board on top of the reflectix.   This way it was outer sheet metal > air gap > reflectix > foam board"

Sticking to everything like it should.   I'm very, very slowly building, I'm lucky that I'm staying with family right now, so I don't have a requirement to finish it ASAP. I used it on the roof between braces, the walls, rear and side doors, and the floor, all up to the cab .

I have some older pictures of where I have it just on the walls, but at home I can upload some more current pictures that shows the roof and floor done.   I didn't go overboard on it, just enough to give the panels some more mass. Some people layer it or go edge to edge, but most of mine are spread out and still effective. If you do get some, get the roller tool (or good gloves), I was too lazy to find it when I started and my hands were raw the next day.

The only tradeoff is that its another layer of insulation so you lose a tiny bit more of interior space, its expensive as all getout, its tricky to install correctly, it will add some more weight and reduce the gas economy.  But yeah, if you plan on sleeping in it frequently and can afford thw stuff you'll probably be happy with it.

vandwellers,39ggxx,ectish,4,Thu Jun 11 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"Good luck with that, it will rot when it gets damp, and it will get damp with people living and cooking in there. Use rockwool or celotex board to insulate your van, then line the insulation with some plastic sheet membrane to prevent condensation, then line that with ply or whatever you fancy. You wouldn't believe how much moisture is created by 1 or more humans living and cooking in a small space."

vandwellers,39i1nm,redfoxsilverwolffang,2,Thu Jun 11 21:51:04 2015 UTC,You could let the normal body color continue onto the roof for a few inches then paint the rest white. This way it looks normal from the side.

They crawl through your hair, clothes, and soul. They can get in through the smallest gaps, and if you go outside for a piss in the night, game over. You'll spend the rest of the night slapping your own body and cursing the skys! I've dealt with scolapendras, scorpions, mozzies, fleas, ticks, and spiders.

I thought I dragged them in on my boots or something and figured they'd die soon enough. But after a few days the little bastards found their way into my sleeping bag. In the morning I swept, scrubbed and inspected every nook and cranny of my interior. They'd made what looked like a mini-colony in residual sawdust under my linoleum floor.

There was no context. Day four of WHAT?!). Watching her interact with the young couple who just moved in upstairs is hilarious, because they don't know yet that she's nuts and that it's best to end the conversation quickly.   There was also the one-legged cocaine dealer who lived across the street from me. When he was arrested and they were taking him to the patrol car, his prosthetic leg fell off, and they had to half carry him while he hopped. He wasn't gone for long, we found out because my boyfriend saw him loudly bragging on the bus that they never found his cocaine stashed inside his fake leg!   There's a few buildings with little innocent college kids nearby all the crazy, and you can see them get really uncomfortable when the more ""interesting"" townies get too close. If my one crust punk friend is around, those kids will cross the street to avoid having to walk past our porch.   There's some amazing people here too though.

vandwellers,39bux8,DanPLynch,5,Thu Jun 11 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Haha thanks for the shout out :).  Here the link to the box van: http://imgur.com/a/B8qa7  I love the box van.  I like the Isuzu's but they don't have a pass through from the drivers seat to the box.
vandwellers,39bux8,CatchMeIfYouVAN,4,Sat Jun 13 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"I had a box truck for my pottery business for about 10 miserable months. It had not occurred to me that a vehicle could get less than ~10 mpg. I was young and naive. When loaded, that thing (late 80s F-350) got 8 mpg going downhill with a tailwind. There is a world of difference between 12-14 mpg and 6-8 mpg. If you are planning on driving the thing more than ~100 miles a month, don't get a box truck. Just: no."
vandwellers,39bux8,mudcelt,3,Thu Jun 11 04:28:38 2015 UTC,"The mileage is always a bit painful but I think people overestimate how much they will drive and how much gas costs.  At 3$ per gal if you go 1000 miles the diff between 8mpg and 14mpg is only 375-214 = $160.  Most people generally drive a commuter car around 1000miles a month but your expense could be more or less depending on how much you actually need to drive.  If you're planning on going across country then yeah it may be worth it to get the better MPG but if you're staying in one spot then it doesn't make too much sense to worry about it.  Now, comparing the Isuzu with the holy grail of gas mileage vans the diesel sprinter (around 25mpg) you may find the cost difference to be a bit different BUT the amount more you pay for the sprinter will probably more than cover the extra cost of gas.  Say the Isuzu is 5k (What I paid for my box van) and you are able to find a sprinter for around 12k well that 7k difference in base is now your gas difference.  It will take a couple of years to recoup the 7k in gas savings.  Also, the Isuzu's and other box vans have diesel options.  This raises your gas mileage quite a bit and you still get the space benefit.    TL;DR - Gas is cheap.  Don't drive too much.  The extra space is awesome."
vandwellers,39bux8,CatchMeIfYouVAN,3,Sat Jun 13 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm also pondering this, wonder if the trade off between fuel usage and space would be worth it. Though you could probably fit a motorbike in one easy enough!"
vandwellers,39bux8,Thermodrama,2,Wed Jun 10 21:12:39 2015 UTC,Any reason to not go the sprinter route instead? Some of the older ones are getting into reasonable price ranges.
vandwellers,39bux8,crockett5,6,Thu Jun 11 00:00:33 2015 UTC,"The reason I wrote off Sprinters is because they are known to break down too often and have an unreliable, far-flung dealer network you must rely on for repairs. Fixes and parts can be expensive too."
vandwellers,39bux8,Seascan,3,Thu Jun 11 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"Sprinters aren't unreliable, get a pre '02 one with the om602 engine, and you'll have a van that will run 500,000+ miles, and pull like a train. Parts are more expensive, but you have to replace them less which costs less in the long run. The downfall of a sprinter is the bodywork is prone to rust, especially around the windscreen, wheel arches, and doors. But a solid chassis and reliable mechanics easily makes up for it."
vandwellers,39bux8,acid_clown,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:15:23 2015 UTC,"I should note that I was speaking from an American viewpoint. We didn't get Sprinters until 2002 or 3, and by most accounts their support network is indeed poor on our side of the pond."

You can also look for the Chevy version, or the Mitsubishi Fuso line.   They are slow but never stop running, at least with the diesels. They are the type of vehicle that are going to top out around 65. IIRC, the ones I was around 10-15 years ago would get around 11-12 MPG, but fully loaded with tools.   As far as converting to a camping situation, it won't be much different from a van or RV. There are so many options for what is behind the cab, so things like insulation, framing/etc are going to depend on the exact vehicle."

Three days of drilling seems like a lot of extra work and the undrilled sheet metal will conduct heat from one side to the other.  Allowing a convective flow of air from the edges should work pretty well.  The end result looks very nice.

One way I've considered is using 1"" and 2"" wooden shims under the support legs of the bed. In theory this should work but it creates another problem of how to secure the bed so it doesn't become a wrecking ball in the event of an accident. To solve that, I'm thinking of using chains attached to the bed legs and bolted to the floor at all four corners with just enough slack to allow the bed to be raised 1-3"""

vandwellers,395h57,_Zeppo_,2,Tue Jun 9 18:23:00 2015 UTC,I use long pieces of cardboard under the side of the bed which is nearest to the side walk. Put down enough so it lifts the sunken side to make a flat bed again. Make sure it is gradual as a slope otherwise the sudden lift will make it uncomfortable. It should start thin then thicken in layers as it gets closer to the curb. You can get free card board from almost anywhere. I get it from markets. They throw it all away.

Having considered doing the same thing in my Honda, I realized there just isn't enough room to allow the seats to swing around, even if I could find a swivel for it, which I couldn't.

vandwellers,392yoc,BigandStupid,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:37:13 2015 UTC,They didn't make Stock seats in any caravan so you likely won't find anything labled specifically for a caravan. You need to find something close enough and adapt it to work with your seat. All a seat base is is 4 holes on the floor and 4 holes on the bottom of the seat. Take the measurements of your floor holes and start checking conversion vans and campers at your local junkyard/pick and pull. that's your best bet at finding something.  I say florr holes as the priority here because of the shape of the floor. Anything can be adapted to anything but if you have a plat floor and try to use a bracket from something with a high floor your going to have a seat that is way too low. So height and floor holes should be a priority when looking for a match. Good luck =)

So I've got my 100ah house battery charging from my engine battery through a continuous duty solenoid via a fused 4 gauge wire (50amp maxi fuse).

vandwellers,3919vk,acid_clown,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I would think that your engine battery will be charged from your alternator at say 100amps, and your second battery would get charged at the same rate as the engine battery because the batteries will balance each other out"
vandwellers,3919vk,Sehc,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:27:08 2015 UTC,The charging in this system is from the alternator. What size is your alternator in amp rating? Then subtract some % as no alternator charges at the rating amps. I would have an ammeter to know the amp charge while operating.
vandwellers,3919vk,urbanvandweller,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:06:37 2015 UTC,continuous duty solenoid   are you using this one? http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Duty-Solenoid-80AMP-12V/dp/B0050I94XG it's max rate is 80 amps which i think an alternator that is rated at 100amps would charge around 75 amps under real conditions so you should be good?  How many 12v batteries do you have set up in parrell isolated from the one car battery
vandwellers,3919vk,Thermodrama,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:23:07 2015 UTC,"Yep that's exactly the one. I didn't even think about that being a source of bottleneck. Either way, if it pulled even 50% of that 80amps, it should have given my single 100ah AGM battery one hell of a charge over the course of a 9 hour drive home.   So in theory, 3 or 4 hours of driving should definitely get me to 100%, even considering the charging amount tapering, right?"

This also means more time spent in the van, more load is put on the system because of increased usage, the fridge runs less efficient because of the increased ambient air temperature and suddenly 100ah isn't enough for anymore than a few days at best.

Stacking em on your van floor in an enclosed space is a recipe for trouble.   Make sure you use an adequate wire gauge. since you will wire them in parallel, each battery you add will increase the size of the wire you need.  Yes, buying large gauge copper wire is expensive. please do not cheap out on this.   the kind of batteries you want should be ""deep cycle"" your average car battery will die very quickly when drained and refilled. try hitting up a boat supply store or an RV shop.   consider getting a charging manager for the batteries. most RV supply and boat stores should have these, but is a sound idea. something with some logic in it should give you a good idea how full the batteries are, and prevent them from overheating, blowing up, or irreversibly damaging them."

Ideally don't paint tanks black or dark colours. Seeing as the inside of your car isn't likely to get warm enough for any of that, it would have to be in direct sunlight, and even then these tanks are design to withstand these kinds of temperatures and pressures. I would imagine any tank that exploded was either defective, damaged, in direct sunlight or any mixture of other issues.

The only one of these that not having a fridge makes sense to me might be the first one, which is what your situation seems to be based on your question. If you're moving regularly, the alternator will keep a house battery charged well enough to run a fridge, and if you're a long way from anywhere, a fridge becomes a very nice luxury.

Many curing processes also involve smoking, spicing, or cooking. Dehydration was the earliest form of food curing.  Salting or curing draws moisture from the meat through a process of osmosis. Meat is cured with salt or sugar, or a combination of the two.

Just got to be careful, especially at this time of year. Bear in mind that my van is big, well insulated and isn't a small little car baking in the sun. Also live in the UK, weather's always shit!"

That is the only negative. Your food lasts way longer, you don't have to spend gas/time/energy going to the store everyday, you have cold water/drinks, you can have leftovers. (You also have an electrical system as a pretty huge side bonus)  If I did it again, I would invest in a fridge again."

My solar runs my fridge, charges ryobi 18v batteries for drill and fan, charges my phone and tablet, runs the stereo in the back while parked, charges lappy and runs my little wifi extender than can boost unsecured signals from restaurants and whatnot when you're parked across the street.   Worth every penny and all the hassle of installing it.  Shit, my solar ran my window unit ac for a half hour this morning so I could sleep a bit more.   So good. Will do again."

I'll finish up with those next month and take until December or whenever I run out of money off. I think I'm going to winter in southern Utah.  As for fuel economy, just like with any vehicle, it's just an expense you take into account when you are planning a trip. I make between 12 and 14mpgs. It could be better but it could be much worse."
vandwellers,38u9es,TheStephBear,11,Sat Jun 6 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"You are in Kentucky.. Lexington to Denver is 1,200ish miles. Your car gets 25-30mpg so lets say 28mpg average.   That's roughly 46 gallons needed @ 2.70/gal average = $125 for gas to get to Denver..  That gives you a budget of $475 to live with. Go to Walmart buy their $19 Colman Butane camp stove and 2 bottle of butane. Then scrounge up some sort of cheap cooking pot to cook on and get 2 plastic spray bottles. ( use the spray bottles one for soapy water one for rinse water to clean your cooking pot) (cook outside your car please)  While you are at walmart buy their best deal on bottled water.. usually the house brand is like 35 bottles in a package and is 6 cents a bottle. Buy a big package of raimen noodles. Some bread & P&J.  You now have a way to cook a warm meal and have both food and drinks for very cheap. You shouldn't spend more than $50 for this. Those water bottle also double as a poor mans shower as long as you find a private place. With a wash cloth you can easily clean your self with a single water bottle and wash your hair with a second..  You now have $425 by the time you get to Denver assuming you don't waste your money buying sodas or other junk.   There are crap loads of jobs in the Denver area.. Even some of the mcdonalds pay almost $10/hr. (last summer the one in Highlands Ranch had a sign on the door for $9.75/hr) I'd personally start sending your resume to anything you see on craigslist that looks appealing the week before you get to Denver. This includes all the temp agencies you can find.   Take the first job you get offered and try to have interviews lined up the day you get into town. I did this last year and started working my 2nd day there. (Use your Kentucky address on your applications and just tell them you are staying with friends until you find a job and decide where to live) I took the first job I was offered at $10/hr.  I was way over qualified and by the 2nd day on that job I told my lead that he needed to pay me more so he raised me to $12/hr on the spot because he agreed.   I later switched to a $17/hr job after turning down loads of $14-15 jobs while holding on to the $12/hr job. (I was getting good overtime so I didn't want to swap because it would take a $16/hr job to replace the $12/hr job due to the easy OT I was getting)  This was grunt warehouse work, at a distribution center. The 2nd job was a cake shipping & receiving job for a company which was making way too much profits for their own good..  If you can't find a job in Denver then something is wrong with you.  I'm actually about to do the same thing but I'm leaving from FL. I'm just about finished with my new van build and took way longer and spent more than I wanted. I haven't worked since last Nov and I'm leaving FL with $500 cash. I do however have a CC which I'll use for my gas and food but I cut deep deep into my savings to get this van finished, so I'm way way lower on funds than I like to be but I know for 100% I can get a good paying job easy in Denver and I'll be there by the middle of the month and be working most likely the week I get in town."

Keep in mind, something of that age and RV type will not bring much money even if it's rebuilt. What I'm saying is it's not a desirable RV so if you spend a lot of money on it you likely will never get it back.  80s & 90s Van based Class C's & even B's can often be found dirt cheap, so it might be worth looking at other options before taking this one just because it's there.  It's very easy to drop $5k or more into something rebuilding it. The interior stuff can be somewhat cheap if you are handy, but if there are issues with the engine, the trans.. You have no way to know because it doesn't run..   IMO it would have to be extremely cheap, as in almost a give away to make it worth taking on.

I think it would be well worth it to buy it and fix it up if you can get it for less then $1000. Have a mechanic check out the engine. Could be many things from what you described. could be a cheap common fix like a carb cleaning or a fuel pump from sitting. or could be an expensive fix like a head gasket. worst case scenario, an 80's chevy 350 motor is a widely available motor at most junk yards for around 500 bucks give or take for mileage.  The biggest complaints I've heard about them is the height. They aren't much taller then a standard cargo van despite having a full B-class interior in all other aspects.  The dual rear axel will cost you on tires if those are shot so be sure to factor that into your estimated cost. Personally I'd buy it and redo it. I wouldn't go shag carpet like the original because that shit gets grimy fast. Honestly you could probably find cheaper alternatives around in better condition but you won't love them as much as you will the transvan =) Whatever you decide good luck!"

I know the battery needs replacement for it to run, and the old fuel should be drained and replaced. The interior is ugly and heavy, and I'd like to strip it down to the bare chassis and build up from there. Making it mechanically should is of course first on the to-do list."
vandwellers,38qyyq,peewinkle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"no but I was looking at one in jersey, almost bought it too. Did alot of research on it after i looked at it. It's a good shell as long as the fiberglass is all intact. It has the length I want, just not the height, well the one i was looking at at least. It was a 1978 model, the one in your photos looks taller. It looks like your best bet would be to gut it and freestyle build the interior. Those windows on top are both cracked, so be sure to check the roof for damage before you make a commitment to it.

Isn't there a new CA law regarding old vehicles?  As with any old vehicle, you have to get it mechanically sound. Not just the motor- for instance, you don't want to do a bunch of work on the inside to drive it and it throws the drive shift because no one bothered greasing it since 1999. I'm not saying you need to replace everything, but it needs to be in decent working condition. A plus on your side is that GM chassis and drivetrains are pretty bullet proof (aside from evil rust but you're in CA) and relatively cheap to work on and find used parts for.  But as a mechanic, I'd tackle it assuming there is nothing dead and rotting in it. And even then, you just need the right cleaners"

vandwellers,38pqt4,Tymanthius,10,Fri Jun 5 20:39:34 2015 UTC,You HAVE to file a police report if you ever expect any insurance claims to be paid. I can't imagine you will be successful in getting anything.  Unless you took pictures at the time of the accident which showed his truck on the scene with the lic plate.. I think you are out of luck.   Never trust someone else to do the tight thing when it's something that will cost you money if they don't.  You have no proof it's his word against yours. For all they care you could of had a wrecked van and just decided to place the blame on this random guy. That's the way his insurance will look at it.

There is no proof who hit you, where it happened or who was there. If they let people file months later based on their own personal recount, anyone could say anyone hit them. For all you know the guy didn't even have a valid license at the time. If he denies hitting you and you have no hard evidence that proves your case.. you have no case. I know words can be a legally binding thing in some states and some allow you to use recorded phone calls as admissible evidence even if both parties didn't know they were being recorded. I'd check the laws in your state and try to get him to admit how much he owes you. If he had someone appraise your cars damage, that could be evidence in your favor. Basically if you want a chance you need to build a case a lawyer could prove."

Parties to small claims actions cannot be represented by attorneys.   So sue the company and the driver in small claims. Bring your girlfriend and any evidence that you can to prove your case. The company will have to designate someone to appear on their behalf - not an attorney. You put on your case and they have to answer to it.

I mean, if the driver gave me a completely wrong insurance card?  Can I use the license plate number to get the correct trucking company?  And what do I do if I end up in this situation: I've filed a small claims suit against the driver and trucking company, but it turns out the named driver wasn't even there, and I don't have the name of the actual driver? Will the court just let me drop the driver's name from the suit, but continue with the same case against the trucking company?  Or do I need to get all that figured out before starting the lawsuit?"

Okay, I'll start googling for FAQs on how to do this.  I feel like there must be some intermediate steps I could take to encourage them to pay, but I don't know exactly what to do.  I've heard mention of 'sending a demand letter'.  Or what if I fill out the police report and then send that to TruckSurance with a letter phrased just the right way to motivate them?  Or what if I simply ask if the driver has signed an affidavit, under penalty of perjury?

The main benefits were: 1. can move around in the van on your knees (this was a e-350 with a pop-up top, and a lot of times I would be somewhere I needed to stay stealth) 2. Can easily cut them to perfectly fit the floor outline, matching right up to the edge of your cabinets etc. 3. Can easily take them out or even replace them if they get something grimy soaked into the material.   Cons: I had a fridge fail, and leaked water from the thawed freezer section. The water basically hid /underneath/ the mats for a few days until I realized what had happened. This caused some discoloration on the van't regular flooring for a while, and cause some water soak damage to the base of one of the cabinets.

In the USA, you'd want to put up a shower curtain or risk arrest for public nudity (only half joking).  You might put a heat reflective/insulative panel between the stove and the undersink storage to isolate the flammable clutter.  Use non-combustible insulation like unfaced fiberglass batt.  Consider adding a section of double wall insulated stove pipe where it goes through the roof.  (In my area, people use wood stoves to start house fires on a regular basis.)  You know about 'chimney fires' I hope.  The offsets from the stove seem  tight and the surfaces should reflect heat and insulate to keep the material behind the surface from heating up.  In general I like the functional carpentry that is not too fussy about fit and finish.  It is very interesting to see how you've evolved your approach after five vans."
vandwellers,38hm6m,vtjohnhurt,6,Thu Jun 4 15:16:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, good to see fire safety being pointed out :-) I'm planning on lining the sides and the back of the cooker like you say, there isn't really any flammable stuff under the sink area normally, so I'm not too worried about fire risk there. I thought about double wall flue when I put the burner in, it doesn't really need it to be honest, after I've fired the burner up, and got it hot, I almost close it down so it's just smouldering, the van is well insulated and doesn't need a roaring fire all the time. the heat around the roof end isn't that hot believe it or not, and the flue goes through some vermiculite board, and then out through a  high heat silicone flue flashing, there isn't any wood or fibreglass within 6 inches of the stack pipe. Behind the flue you can see more vermiculite board, that stuff is definitely essential to protect the wall from catching fire. I should put some more on the side of the cupboard, but that ladder is quite a good heat sink, and I just can't be fucked really!  I don't have a shower curtain, buy usually have the roller shutter down when I'm showering, so nobody is subjected to seeing my enormous dick in public! :-)"
vandwellers,38hm6m,vtjohnhurt,2,Thu Jun 4 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"I almost close it down so it's just smouldering   I'm sure that you're doing 99% of it right (or you would have had a fire by now.)  A smoldering fire will deposit creosote more rapidly on the interior of the flue pipe.  A chimney fire happens when the creosote on the inside of the flue pipe ignites.  This causes a jet engine like draft and much higher than normal heat in the pipe.  This extreme heat may ignite the surrounding material that is just fine for normal smoke temperatures.  The double walled flue pipe reduces the surface temperature of the outside of the flue where it comes into contact with the roof gasket.  Creosote buildup and chimney fires are still a concern but the double walled pipe improves the odds.  In the short run you can check the inside of your flue pipe for creosote and since it is a straight shot, it should be easy to clean the creosote on a regular basis from above. (You can buy a special brush for this.)  The creosote burns very hot once it is ignited."

vandwellers,38hm6m,monkeywelder,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat - just wanted to try out part timing after trying it in my old Peugeot 106.  Decided to try it on the cheap so I thought about getting a people carrier that I could take the seats out of. Ended up with a P reg Citroen Synergie for £450. Got it set up though and I spend a week at a time living in it.   Are you pondering it for surf trips specifically, or the van life in general?"

Here in America I've been looking for a van/truck that has the above-cab ""mother's attic"" area PLUS a passageway between the cab and back/cargo. Did your van come standard with the passageway, or did you have to cut it?   Anyone have ideas as to what make/model would have this combination of features? U-Hauls with the attic never seem to have connections between cab and back, and it would seem difficult to engineer yourself, IMO?  Why'd your roof leak, btw? Skylight? I'm terrified of persistent leaks after a bad RV experience of an elderly friend..."
vandwellers,38k9l5,Old-Thunder,6,Thu Jun 4 19:43:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this falls under security, but someone mentioned a locking gas cap not too long ago and that sounds like a great idea if you don't want people siphoning your gas on an older vehicle while you're out doing what you do.   Some people swear by those bars you put across your steering wheels, anyone have experience with them?"
vandwellers,38k9l5,fluxofapathy,3,Thu Jun 4 22:06:17 2015 UTC,"if you are referring to steering wheel locking bars, they are useless. What most people don't realize is the metal bar underneath the foam of a steering wheel isn't very thick at all and can be cut with a good hacksaw in about 30 seconds or less. The cheapest line of defense is a kill switch or pulling a main link fuse thus disabling the vehicle.  http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/burnt-out-car-26048699.jpg"
vandwellers,38k9l5,_Phreedom,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:13:55 2015 UTC,Good to know. Won't waste money on one now.
vandwellers,38k9l5,fluxofapathy,5,Fri Jun 5 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"Bearing in mind that I have no idea how to wire one, I always thought a hidden kill switch on your ignition or fuel pump would be a cool idea, as I would be less nervous about letting the van sit in places while I'm out working/hiking/camping. Maybe somebody here has experience with this and knows if it's a good idea?   Other than that, a good working car alarm and well-tinted windows + curtains should do you fine. Ideally an alarm you can set off manually with a key fob, for say late nights when you can hear someone snooping outside the van you're sleeping in.   You can keep mace and a hunting knife inside with you too, if that gives you more peace of mind. I think I might get a good knife, if only for its more practical camping uses.   Edit: to be more specific about the kill switch, I'm assuming it would be wired in series with your ignition/fuel pump and perhaps mounted somewhere discreet under the hood. When you leave, you can just pop the hood, open the switch, and feel good about your secureness. I've also heard about them being in the glove box, but I'd rather it be mounted outside the cab."
vandwellers,38k9l5,Arrivaderchie,6,Thu Jun 4 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"Just remember that if someone steals a Vanagon, the chances of them making it beyond twenty miles without overheating, warping a head, dropping third gear, etc ,are slim to none;) Actually though, Vanagons are being stolen in the u.s. about once a week. I plan on putting a kill switch in mine soon."
vandwellers,38k9l5,axf7228,6,Thu Jun 4 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"A real simple way to accomplish the kill switch effect without any wiring or additional work is to simply pull a fuse.  Main fuse, ecm, fuel pump, starter, etc...depending on your vehicle any one of those should do the job."
vandwellers,38k9l5,NoSmallAdventurevan,5,Fri Jun 5 00:26:22 2015 UTC,"I second the hidden kill switch, specially if you happen to live in the PNW. Westy's seem to be the van of choice which the meth heads up there steal..  Also something a lot of people don't think about, but a very bright small light like a mag light but one of the extremely bright ones. if you are out at night and someone starts screwing with you, something as simple as shining a light in their eyes can completely dis-ordinate them. It's the same reason cops do it to people at night.. first thing they do is shine their big flashlight in your face so blind you."
vandwellers,38k9l5,crockett5,3,Thu Jun 4 21:31:21 2015 UTC,I did a road trip to Mexico.   I used a battery disconnect switch mounted in the top part of my passenger foot well.  It was activated with a key that you could take out.    I usually kept the key in.   Only issue happened after I lent my vehicle to some friends and the passenger was drunk and accidentally kicked the switch off. He sprawled out in the seat just after getting in.   They couldn't figure out why the car wouldn't start until I informed them of my secret button.   Pretty simple to install.
vandwellers,38k9l5,caramelboy,3,Fri Jun 5 06:35:24 2015 UTC,"C02 detector, smoke detector.  Maybe a security alarm on the glass and doors."
vandwellers,38k9l5,pyres,4,Fri Jun 5 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"More than likely the people who would break into your vehicle aren't looking to steal it, they're simply looking for the least effort needed to get their next fix, so that's smash and grab for anything of value.  The big ones for smash and grab are cash, electronics, jewelry, and tools.  I'm going to assume most of us don't have to worry about leaving jewelry laying around.  If you're driving a fully converted Sprinter with satellite antennas on the roof though you're advertising cash and electronics.  Stealth camping has it's advantages, but looking too much like a work truck with tools in it may be a disadvantage security wise?  I really like car alarms.  They annoy the hell out of me, but do the job.  The added bonus of being able to remotely activate via keyfob while in the vehicle is fantastic.  As other posters have mentioned, tinted windows, curtains, and a locking gas cap. I would go one step further by throwing a locking lug nut on each wheel.  Little things like that show that you're not careless and therefore not an easy target."

You have zero compunctions about cutting huge holes in your roof or screwing ladders into the side, which I salute. I'm terrified of introducing leaks like that.  Thanks for mentioning the topper cost. Down in LA I saw a quote of about 4500 installed, which sounded displeasingly high but not as bad as up north, apparently.  Regarding the new wall strategy, won't the metal stud create undesirable thermal bridging from the outside?"
vandwellers,38hl44,Seascan,2,Thu Jun 4 20:00:52 2015 UTC,I put a lot of caulking in every hole with rubber washers on the bigger bolts.  I have high hopes they won't leak.    I think there will be some heat loss through the stud but probably less than the original wood stud design.  The new plan should will give me a larger insulation cavity so the R-13 can loft closer to its designed volume.  Or I could be completely wrong and have to burn tons of propane in the winter to keep the place livable.
vandwellers,38hl44,Dathisofegypt,2,Thu Jun 4 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"Given the limited surface area of the single stud you'll probably be fine. Just a good idea to avoid bridging in general, when possible.  Fingers crossed on the water sitch!"

Depending on the food you leave you can do more harm than good and you could attract dangerous predators. I know they make pepper spray supposedly formulated for bears but I consider myself a bit of a tough guy I'll stand up to anybody if needed but I'm not facing a bear armed with pepper spray.
vandwellers,38f6xq,axf7228,-1,Thu Jun 4 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Frankly I don't care. If I choose to leave an apple core out to attract an animal that could potentially eat me instead, that's my choice. After all, we are part of the food chain. I understand the negative ecological impacts of doing so, but on a small scale the impact is almost nonexistent."

vandwellers,38f6xq,alexkram,2,Sun Jun 7 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"Be sure to get at least a 3/4 ton truck and a camper on the light end of the spectrum. My truck camper says 1480 lbs on the nameplate (a light one, I've seen up to 3800 lbs!) and my F250 truck weighs 9100 lbs with it on (truck max legal weight is 8800 lbs). This is without any water on board. I think the camper manufacturers lie about the weights.  With pets I would worry about them overheating in the camper when you are away. If you are in a campground with power and AC maybe not an issue."
vandwellers,38f6xq,alexkram,2,Thu Jun 4 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!  I've just been looking into portable generators that can handle starting up the AC.

vandwellers,38f6xq,shanemhansen,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:24:36 2015 UTC,I have a Honda EU2000 generator and it wasn't powerful enough to run the AC in the Casita trailer I had. You would probably want a camper with a built-in generator if you plan to run the AC because it will be heavy to carry it in and out of the camper for use. Only the heaviest campers have that. A class C RV might be a better choice for you.

Shove 'em whever they fit in the van exterior Keep all of your bagged/boxed foods in glass containers, whether mason jars or larger. I found these for cheap at Walmart.  Spray the exterior of the van (particularly parts that come in contact with the ground, such as any power cords and of course your tires) with ant/bug spray, if you're comfortable being around it.

Those flies will eventually find that 1 seem or crevice that you cannot clean, reach or whatever and then the new flying bugs keep harrasing you once a week orso. Be sure you can keep the van clean, certainly where the food is stashed and cooked. If they find a seam near that spot, those predators will be bugging you until you remove all the eggs/larva/things."

The things people dont like about people who live in vehicles are already illegal. Like dumping sewage, littering, creating a disturbance, drugs, etc....  And if youre just a person minding your own business and living in a vehicle not causing problems like the vast majority are, then theres no issue. Theres probably someone living on my street in a van ive never even noticed. Who is that hurting?  This is just another example of california saying fuck everyone who doesnt have a ton of money to give to the state as a ""leave me alone"" fee.

vandwellers,389wbd,pillowpants80,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"Your laptop is a perfect example. so in the case of your laptop adapter, would it be drawing 3.4 amps from the battery or 2.0 amps?"
vandwellers,389wbd,pillowpants80,3,Wed Jun 3 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"Heh, this is where it gets fun. First off, basic information on electricity, you have 3 pillars, watts, amps, and volts. All 3 have a symbiotic relationship when you start to convert.   TL/DR: 6.6 amps  For my laptop adapter, it is rated 2 amps from the wall at 120v. Plug that into this calculator, and when plugged into an inverter getting power from a 12v source, it will pull 22 amps, at full tilt. However, it never actually pulls that much, and very few laptops would be able to use a 240 watt power brick (120v * 2 amps = 240 watt). This number is useless for us.   Jumping over to the output, we have 19v at 3.4 amps. This is what the power brick will actually be able to output. However, neither our batteries or inverter are running at 19v, so we can't use these numbers as they are. We can work from it to do some calculations. In doing the v * a = w formula, we get that it can output a max of 65 watts.   So now we go back to the post-inverter calculation. We have an inverter running at 120v, and a power brick that can use 65 watts max. 65w / 120v = .54a. This is for a perfect inverter change, which doesn't happen, it can be anywhere from 85-90% efficient. Using the above link again, and rounding up to .6a, gives us a 12v load of 6.62amps.   6.62a is the calculated number of amps that your inverter will pull from a 12v battery while providing 65w to a laptop.   In this case, that 65w will only be used while charging the laptop. Once the battery is charged, the load will be much lower. IIRC from a few years ago playing with this laptop, I could get the running requirements down to about 10-15w."

vandwellers,384oyn,Vantographer,3,Mon Jun 1 21:02:46 2015 UTC,We have just about the same exact setup. I even have the clothes hanging in the same spot and sleep in the same area. There's room in the back for plenty of storage. That's just crazy. Usually everyone on here has a bed long-ways or puts it in the very back. Nice pic for sure. The only big difference is I have nothing where your toolboxes are and I'm looking to build a desk to work in that area. Keep us updated on how it goes for you.
vandwellers,384oyn,hellb0t,3,Mon Jun 1 22:08:16 2015 UTC,Haha thats awesome! Yeah Im only 5'8 so the bed works out perfect. If I was any taller I would have to turn it sideways.

vandwellers,384oyn,tinkerer13,4,Mon Jun 1 22:37:20 2015 UTC,Its just the fold down bench that came with the van. Im planning on building a platform bed with a memory foam matress very soon tho. It will be way more comfortable and it will open up more storage room underneath.
vandwellers,384oyn,haliforniadreaming,2,Mon Jun 1 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"I like the memory foam idea. It only has to be a few inches thick to be comfortable, it'll help keep you warm, and you can easily cut it down to fit."

vandwellers,3866gq,Goldberry,4,Tue Jun 2 03:19:05 2015 UTC,Extreme weather and a dog in a car do not mix at all
vandwellers,3866gq,xinaked,2,Tue Jun 2 05:31:17 2015 UTC,I agree. So what are the solutions? I was thinking maybe I could find someone with a fenced-in yard and pay doggie rent for her to have a place to go during the day. Any other ideas?
vandwellers,3866gq,ChooChoo_ImA_Hobo,2,Tue Jun 2 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, I back packed and hopped trains for 8 years I've always had a dog by my side along the way I've rubber tramped a few times from a versa to pick ups to R.Vs to a Subaru. The one thing you can absolutely do to combat extreme weather which first off needs to be split into hot and cold as the two are very different.  This is all in the context of my experience with owning Australian Cattle Dogs(Heeler, Kelpie) The heeler being environmentally inclined towards moderate to Hot as the Kelpie was much more tolerant of Super Cold - Super Hot.  When ever I found my self stranded in the fucking desert i.e Indio, Cali - San Antonio, Tx during summer time I'd fucking hate my self and all my life choices. The only way you will be able to manage living out of a car with a dog, anywhere, is if you can work that dog into every facet of your life. This means not leaving it in the car for more than 20 minutes at a time with at least Two windows rolled down enough so that it may stick it's head out side. Along with that you will need to have a bowl of water preferably with ice so that if some one looked into your car, because they will if they see the dog, they can see it has A. Water B. Ice signifying the that it has not been long since you left.  I was staying over at a friends house and it was a tiny apartment above a elderly couples house and they were not dog friendly, so that night we left my dog to sleep in the car, windows rolled down, bucket of water with some ice with the intention of returning first thing in the a.m, I woke up to a bunch of cops and a raving lunatic of a dog catcher trying to arrest me, take my dog and all sorts of other horse shit.  First off they hated me because I look like I ride trains, what ever, I don't buy into the every day mainstream idea that we should all toil in the fields needlessly but that's a whole nother tangent. Well my friend got me a place to crash at and the guy just so happened to be a disabled sheriff. I was trying to tell them where and who I was staying with but I couldn't remember his fucking name. The pulled out infrared thermostats and read the cars exterior temp rather than the interior which is about a 20 degree difference. Long story short they had absolutely no ground to stand on, they locked my dog in the back of the animal patrol van, hand cuffed me for 45 minutes as I explained to them he was a service dog, they can't do this and that I did nothing wrong, then they joked about putting my dog down etc etc. I got a formal apology from the officers involved once I remembered the guy's name a Srgt. came down and was like all buddy buddy with me I guess he looked up to the guy I was staying with.  That right there is a potential horror story.  The only reason it didn't go down the other way was because I countered a cop with another cop, if I was any where else and that happened I'd been fucked and my dog would be taken away or worse. It's a fact cops like to fuck with people and if they think that it's justified or even worse, that they can get away with it they will do what they want. Cops from the get go are trained in how to justify every thing they do, it's also natural for them to be suspicious and suspect the worse of a person especially if you have gotten their attention. Never since that day have I let my dog stay in the car for an extended period of time with out my attention.  On the other hand I go to parties here and there, shows here and there and I have no problem letting my dog sleep in the car at events. At night time crack the windows about 2-3 inches both sides and leave water.   Winter is about the same as night time, make sure they have plenty of blankets, one or two army surplus wool blankets are good, and a sleeping bag which you'll already have should do the trick, avoid electric blankets while they are alone.   I for the most part keep my dog with me 100% of the time and if any where I'm going has a problem I just report them and move on, they will regret it later on down the line. I neither have the patience nor the tenacity it takes to sue any one or any thing.  If you're out Rubber tramping and ""alexander supertramping"" get a dog, shouldn't be a problem as long as you're responsible, I've had two dogs these past 8 years and I've never lost a dog to my life style unlike so many others I know who have sadly.  If you plan to work many types of jobs are dog friendly and many people don't even know it. Places that I've brought my dog to work include a game store, an upscale fine dinning restaurant, She'd hang out on the side patio while I bussed, construction and along side so so many odd jobs but those are few and far between.  Ontop of all of that if you have a friend you can count on and pay to watch you're dog, or better yet free, or even betterer yet pay you to watch your dog, then go for it. Buyer beware you hardly ever get what you pay for, I once payed my ex-best friend who, is an asshole, 10 dollars a day to ""watch"" my dog aka, leave in the back yard so she can jump the fence and traverse 5 miles of Austin to show up at the restaurant you work at while also on top of complaining about having to watch her via text while she's at my job.  I lost that dog about 3 years ago and I still hurt every single day, every single time I realize she's gone, I still have dreams where they're so real I've long since ceased accepting them and remind my self even while I dream that it is not real. The cluster fuck of the reason I lost her was a mix of ""doing what's right, buying into to the phasode and trying to help some one out."" Put you're dog first and you will be fine, put you're dog second and it will come back to you."

Have a vent fan up high exhausting out, a fan low pulling air in and fan that doggy can sit in front of.  if the shell isnt white, it needs to be.  Plenty of water.  A camper is different than sticking your dog in a hot steel car full of windows in a hot parking lot.

I'm talking changing belts, changing the air filter, checking the oil and other fluids etc. and even basic repairs like changing an alternator or doing brakes..   Trying to find a good mechanic as you travel around isn't the easiest so being able to take care of brakes, oil changes, spark plugs/wires etc is good too..    I maintain my sis-in-laws Grand Caravan (2000) which is about the same as your Voyager...   It's not the easiest thing to work on as the transverse engine with no doghouse makes it hard to get to things on the back of the engine.  Heck, I had to look up where/how to change the air filter as it's different than anything I've worked on before..   Anyway, knowing the basic is good, and having the ability to be self sufficient is always a good feeling..  Of course, living in a van means you have to pick and choose..

Since it sounds like you're not, best advice would be to move onto something else.  Find someone with the time, tools, and skills that's looking for a project and sell it to them.  Also, $2500 seems crazy expensive, but that's California for you, and bay area is likey the most expensive place in California.  Taking it to a less expensive state you could probably find a shop that would do all that for under $1k."
vandwellers,385y5g,socalsuperhero,2,Tue Jun 2 02:37:38 2015 UTC,I agree with socal on this.  Try to avoid verticals that are too old.  Depending on how much of that 2500 USD is labor you may be able to save a lot of money by driving 3-4 hours out of the metro area to some small rural town.  Life is much cheaper in depressed rural towns and you can usually find some unofficial mechanic to fix it for 20% of normal labor costs.  Your money will go much further in the middle of nowhere because people are used to getting by with less.
vandwellers,385y5g,urbanvandweller,2,Tue Jun 2 04:30:35 2015 UTC,in the bay area it's hard because of silcon valley money. I suggest taking if out of state or rural parts of southern cali.

I imagine that isn't exactly good for the car and/or your pocketbook though for long periods of time. Check for free camping sites online. I've noticed a few different ones. Usually they are places like state/federal parks where you can just pitch a tent anywhere."

I plan to use battery operated fans, park in shady campsites, and keep my windows open. I used to sleep for nights in my hospital garage where it was dark/cool so this will be different. PM me if you want to chat!"
vandwellers,385w0b,lo_dolly_lolita,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"paint your car white.  you can do it yourself cheap, look up 50dollar paint job.  park under a tree.  I work nights, this is what i do.  its not the most restful but you get used to it and its only for the hottest months.  Hydrate well at work. I get off work at 7am, go right to sleep.  wake up at noon, the heat usually wakes me up but if you are a heavy sleeper, set an alarm for safety sake.  keep some gatorage on hand amd drink it upon waking.  get up and out of vehicle, either park for swim or public AC.  Around 6 or 7 i return and sleep until my shift at 11.  Avoiding the hottest parts of day.  Try to face the part of your car you are sleeping in away from the path of the sun...so turn it around for your evening sleep.  fans, , reflectix window shades,venting etc."
vandwellers,385w0b,DazarGaidin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"Roofs aren't the only source of shade - look for some trees! Be sure to figure out where the sun will be passing over the course of the day and find a spot that will remain mostly shaded. Also, areas by water (especially moving water, like a river) will generally be a good bit cooler than others.  Also, a battery-powered fan that's in the boundary between inside and outside the van can make a big difference, especially if it's blowing out near the top (if you have any place to vent up high).  You could paint your roof white, or if you're fancy, you could even use one of the new elastomeric heat-shielding paints as discussed here:http://www.roofers.org/Blog.aspx?p=6a24db53-d0cb-42cd-8a4f-628b7fbd8192 like one of these: http://www.ultimatecoatings.net/Products.html or these: http://www.davlincoatings.com/coolroofkit.htm"

It busted my radiator and fuel pump, leaving me stuck.  It turned out my brother could make the 350 mile drive to come get me, but only after 4 days. It was the middle of winter.  I had enough stocks of food and water, but two things I lacked were heat and a way to recharge the car battery. I had to ration my gas use to try and make it last, but I expected to have a running engine, so with only ~16 hours of gas it got very cold.  I passed the time by going for walks, but it wasn't great weather so that was limited so I was stuck inside for most of the 4 days.  Eventually got towed back home, but it wrote off the car. I don't know what happened with the deer, but we're not on the best terms."

She didn't follow through as they were there the next day and got kicked out.  Also.. at the same walmart (Denver area) there was a guy living in his Tacoma truck, supposedly had a nice set up in his topper. He was ex military or something but kept to himself and didn't like talking to anyone. Some other guy whom was using a tent in his truck bed was playing his stereo loud and the guy with the Tacoma pulled a gun on him..  I wasn't there when it happened but one of the other ""locals"" told me about it..  As far as stories I've heard.. last year there was a news article of a bunch of people over nighting at some park on the beach somewhere in the PNW I think it was. Some random guy came along and started shooting at all the RV's and so forth.. I think 1 of the RV people was killed in their bed and the shooter committed suicide.."

I was in the back of my 2002 Dodge Durango during daylight, and he didnt know I was in the back of the truck. I was awake and was cleaning a blister on my foot and the front and back windows were down. He parked his car behind me, but he didn't know anyone was inside.  I called out ""Hello Officer"" since I was sure he couldn't see through the tint in the back of the truck.  He pulled his gun and yelled ""SHOW ME YOUR HANDS, NOW!"".  I had a cotton ball in one hand when I reached my hands out and he yelled again, ""SHOW ME YOUR HANDS, NOW!!!!"".  I dropped the cotton ball on the ground outside the truck.  He then yells ""SLOWLY, GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE, SLOWLY!""  I explain I need to unlock the door, and do so with one hand while the other is still out the window.  I open the door and step out of the back of the truck.  He tackles me and cuffs me.  He then runs his hands through my pockets (which are empty) and asks ""Where is your ID?"" (He has calmed down now that I am cuffed and face down in the parking lot I was in).  I direct him to the ID in my truck, he radios in with the info, many minutes go by, gets a response and realizes i have no warrants and my license and truck are in order.  He pulls me up so I can stand and starts asking why I am here.  I explain I live in my truck and I am in the back of this abanoned parking lot to try and lay low and keep out of the way.  Minutes later he lets me go and says I can stay there until someone complains of me trespassing and that he was just responding to an abandoned vehicle call.  I have dealt with cops a few times in my life for me being stupid in public (drinking in public, but nothing criminal) but I have never had one pull a gun on me, nor have I ever had anyone pull a gun on me and point it at me.  After thinking about it for a few days I wondered if he has been in a bad cop situation where he has had a gun pulled on him and he hasn't really felt safe since then.  Needless to say, I didnt stay there any longer in that parking lot, even though it was for an abandoned shopping center in St Petersburg, FL  EDIT: formatting"

After a few sparks, we realized that it was someone by the trailhead map with a lighter, trying to catch a flame. I opened the door of the van and yelled out into the darkness, ""Need a flashlight?"", expecting to hear back from a relieved hiker. Instead, whoever it was retreated back further into the shadows with no response.   This freaked us out enough that we ended up finding somewhere else to sleep that night, our imaginations running wild trying to conjure up an explanation for the mysterious encounter. To this day I wonder who it was and why they were out there creeping around in the dark."

It's summer now, but for cooler nights to come, hot water bottles have been my favorite comfort item. With one at your feet, you'll drift off to sleep like a baby. For hot nights, some people freeze them and make cold water bottles, but I haven't tried that yet.   Also, my windows are tinted but not blacked out, so I cover everything in the back with a dark brown sheet that makes the van look empty to the casual glance. I know that you're blacking out the windows, but in San Francisco, they'll smash your car window to steal your used shoes, so I would experiment with minimizing the appearance of stuff if possible. My stomping grounds, by the way, and the weather is fantastic. Have a great trip!"
vandwellers,37zkdh,kenbw2,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be trying the frozen water bottle trick. Instead of buying ice, we're going to freeze a whole case of water bottles and using that in a cooler, and then refilling them and re-freezing them when we can."
vandwellers,37zkdh,Bigfrostynugs,2,Tue Jun 2 19:13:08 2015 UTC,Fellow minivan camper here!
vandwellers,37zkdh,kenbw2,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:47:47 2015 UTC,What's your setup?
vandwellers,37zkdh,saskatchewanderer,3,Sun May 31 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"I had my bed similar to yours, but it was a single so went down the length of the wall. But it occurred to me one night that I didn't need a raised bed. I've got shelves like this: http://i.imgur.com/FOVeMb5.png. The blue thing is a folding mattress, that can be made into a small double.  Yours seems to have a lot of storage along the sides, what vehicle is it?  What's the height from floor to ceiling in yours?"
vandwellers,37zkdh,saskatchewanderer,1 point,Sun May 31 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"It's a 1999 Pontiac Montana. The things on the sides are more wheel well than storage...although they both have cup holders and a small flip up storage area. I'm not sure what the interior height is, I'll have to check. The way it is now gives me enough room to prop myself up on my elbows or sit cross-legged hunched over."
vandwellers,37zkdh,drewdbell,2,Sun May 31 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"I think minivan dwelling is feasible, but the small size does create a few challenges. Showering inside is one, hence the question about height. But also it's narrow so the bed has to go lengthways. It means that the bed space occupies what would be living space.  It's why I've gone for the folding-bed-under-the-shelves thing, but it does make for a bit of a faff every night and morning.  But it has its advantages - it's much easier to find places to park since it is basically a car. It's stealthier if that's important. And dat mpg doe :)"
vandwellers,37zkdh,xxxenadu,1 point,Sun May 31 19:56:29 2015 UTC,I always a imagined a minivan would be less stealthy than a normal sized van just because of the additional windows. Did you black them out or have curtains or anything?
vandwellers,37zkdh,69ing,2,Sun May 31 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be installing some curtains with some tracks I had laying around from IKEA, and then hemming some old curtains and sewing in velcro at the bottoms to attach them to the walls of the van."
vandwellers,3816pg,saskatchewanderer,2,Mon Jun 1 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"I left some on the outside of a hatch on my boat.  I taped it with foil tape.   If you set it up right you can cook small meals with it.  But over a very short time it broke down and was basically bubble wrap after a month or two. It would work, youd have to keep it a few inches off the surface and find a way to make it rigid.  But in direct light in breaks down fast.   Even the stuff I used on the inside of the windows breaks down but it takes longer.   With all the windows covered and taped it makes about a 40-50 degree temperature difference.   I did make window screens and side window screens out of reflectix for the van. I cut them tighter than the window shades you get in stores and they make a serious heat difference.  This was in the florida keys in late summer.   Better option is to put on a roof rack  and use solar panels as shade.  You could get some metal roofing and use to cover the spots as you add panels. Even a white piece of rigid plywood would work as well."
vandwellers,3816pg,monkeywelder,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information! Based on that I'm definitely going to try and set up some kind of rigid barrier to install on the roof. Our van won't be a long term dwelling, more useful for road trips less than one month so it's not a big deal if it breaks down after a month.  I may even make it semi permanent so it lasts longer."
vandwellers,3816pg,cookieguy10,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:18:54 2015 UTC,Getting out of the rig and posting up underneath a tree works really good for beating the heat
vandwellers,3816pg,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:52:06 2015 UTC,"I glued reflectix directly to my ceiling. But the stuff only works in combination with an air gap so I attached wood strips and double sided tape to hold coroplast sheets in place like this.. You can see the finished ceiling at my build log here.  For winter I hoped the reflectix would bounce the heat back into the interior while the air gap insulated. In the summer, I wanted it to reflect incoming heat back out the roof. However, I think I messed up because, afaik, heat easily passes from reflectix into metal. As it is there's no gap between it and the bare metal roof so I think I did it wrong. Someday I plan to take down the coroplast, stick reflectix to the top side, and reattach it. That way there'd be an air gap for both incoming and outgoing heat. .. I think. Still not sure myself."

Nice to see they're not just letting the wood sit there to rot."
vandwellers,37wjag,MistaBig,5,Sun May 31 03:19:12 2015 UTC,I like the wood siding. Did you just leave the van empty inside or did you build out some cabinets and so on?
vandwellers,37wjag,crockett5,7,Sun May 31 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"I originally had everything in permanently.  But I was constantly changing what I needed the van for.  In Megavan v.1 it had overhead bins and lockers, and thing for a minifridge and microwave, desk module and a huge king sized bed with an enormous basement under. But i kept using the bed for storage and ended up sleeping on the same space as a single.  When I started v2 i came up with a modular set up.  I may need the van for moving, camping, working on my boat( a 45 foot sailboat) or working at a client site.   So now Im redoing the bed and putting it on wheels with enough space for storage and extra 12v batteries.  a 2000w inverter and stuff.  theres a work bench that rolls in with storage for all the tools needed to work on the boat.  and in the future.  new computer/workstation module and kitchen module.  With in an hour Ill be able to change the config for what ever I need.   and on top of that the modules will fit on the boat. As the bed module finishes Ill post pics."

vandwellers,37wr9h,One_Awesome_Inch,1 point,Sun May 31 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively new to this, so please forgive my ignorance. The point of this setup is so your leisure battery can be charged by the solar panel and/or the car's alternator, right? If so, approximately how much can your leisure battery be charged only by the alternator in 30 minutes?"
vandwellers,37wr9h,outforsnacks,2,Mon Jun 1 21:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, correct. I tried living off the alternator, and then separately solar alone. Neither worked, so I'm seeing if I can live off both. This is a breakdown of my power usage.  I'm not entirely sure on this, but I think it charges from the alternator at about 2.5 amps.For perspective, a sunny day in the UK sees the solar charge at 3 - 3.5 amps.  Let me know if you need something clarifying, I'll do my best to help."

If your tints are dark enough you have to be right up against the glass to see them."

vandwellers,37wp2f,TheUtomjording,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's expensive. I ended up getting one for my passenger side. On the drivers side I have an extra trucker-suspension under the seat so installing a swivel base there requires moving the handbreak, lifting the seat more etcetera. Ended up building a bench that I use for a seat with the backrest from the drivers side. Works really good!

vandwellers,37wm81,69ing,1 point,Sun May 31 00:30:44 2015 UTC,it depends on where youre at.   I like the butane table top single but I really use the microwave more than anything when hooked up.  the alcohol we have on the boat.  Its a hybrid electric.  We seem to have a lot of kitchen fires with the alcohol.  I think its more the set up and operator.  Propane would have more uses and availability of fuel.  I had a 1lb refill adapter so I could refill from a bbq tank.  Some of the propane stoves could be used as a space heater too.
vandwellers,37wm81,monkeywelder,1 point,Sun May 31 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"I like the flat stoves that take small butane cartridges. I see a lot of the tall ones on here, and I think they're a fire waiting to happen. The flat ones can't be knocked over.  The cartridges are about £1 - £1.50 each and last ~4 hours on full. They're widely available from camping stores, ebay and even supermarkets.  That said, if you have the room for a full propane tank then that's likely much cheaper"
vandwellers,37wm81,kenbw2,1 point,Sun May 31 01:22:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with the flat single burner rather than the tall tippy type, but since my heater is propane, I wanted the same fuel source. I eventually found one of these: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Texsport-Single-Burner-Propane-Stove-Used-/381277693284. The propane cartridges are also a LOT more common and less expensive than butane, assuming you're in the US. I'm not familiar with alcohol stoves, but having considerable experience with white gas, I would personally avoid liquid fuels."
vandwellers,37wm81,BigandStupid,1 point,Sun May 31 04:59:08 2015 UTC,"Check out the Coleman Powerpack. Its a single burner stove with a very stable, low base. Good quality too."
vandwellers,37wm81,One_Awesome_Inch,1 point,Sun May 31 17:04:02 2015 UTC,"You can get Butane, Propane or a mixture of both to form Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). In Europe it isn’t allowed to fuel a stove from the same LPG tank which is used for driving. The reasoning behind this is that you want to extract liquid LPG for driving, but for cooking you need to extract gas from the tank. Apparently it is not possible to construct a safe or suitable tank for both states of matter (with or without certain additives). You can however get a separate gastank or cilinder for LPG which can fuel your appliances in your dwelling (some RV's tend to have these). In the summer you can get LPG with higher butane-ratio and in the winterseason you can fill the gastank (or buy a cilinder) with LPG on a higher propane ratio. This also means that gas that you have tanked/bought in the summer, could not be usable during the winter. Most people in Europe tend to use simple Propane because it is well suitable below 0 degrees making it a widely applicable energy resource no matter the circumstances and butane is not (has to be above 0 degrees). The only reason why butane is used sometimes is because its 30% more energy efficient. To utilize that efficiency you'll need appliances that can convert the higher energy/liter into less fuel consumption. If you have very simple appliances chances are that energy efficiency wise it wont matter much or atleast alot less then 30%. So be sure to check the possibilities your appliances offer and calculate the difference in the gas prices in your area if you are using alot of gas. I bet some stoves can handle both propane and butane, so they grant you a choice to pick a more money/energy efficient fuel.  I dont have much knowledge about bio-ethanol (thats alcohol right?), so someone else should post about that."

vandwellers,37s785,frog__man,3,Fri May 29 23:31:05 2015 UTC,You could also get a computer fan or two from amazon... that uses 80 milliamps. Attach those to a 12v dimmer and you have more control. Just a thought. Thats what I'm doing

However, before you save for that, you should make sure you save for an emergency fund because if you lose your car thru theft or fire you could end up homeless.... worse case scenario. If you have $2000 or $3000 saved up you can just buy a new vehicle to live in. Best of luck."

Living in my car doesn't inconvenience me to the point were I feel getting a van is necessary. If I was to make this a committed lifestyle, then yes. I do this to fund what I call ""super activities"". Last year I saved to create a generous financial safety net. This year I'm saving to hike the Pacific Crest Trail next year. Then next year I'll save to do something else."
vandwellers,37s785,Thermodrama,2,Sun Jun 7 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"Let's do the math. Since we don't know the exact power consumption of the device, we'll use the specifications of the power adapter, which will be higher than the actual consumption, but a good baseline: 12VDC, 500mA. To power the device for 8 hours, a 12V battery would need to have a capacity of 0.500A*8hr = 4Ah (4 Amp-Hours). Ideally you would aim for a bit higher to compensate for capacity loss and cell voltage decreasing as the charge level drops. A battery pack like this may suit your needs. As long as you find a pack that supplies 12v and has a capacity of 4Ah or greater, it should work."
vandwellers,37s785,Thermodrama,2,Fri May 29 23:43:12 2015 UTC,Thank you!   I've done a little more poking(on random forums) and found that the fan consumes anywhere from .5a~1a per hour. I feel it would be in my best interest to lean on the heavy side and go with 1a.  So 1.000a*8hr=8Ah or 8000mah.   The one you noted is 6000mah/6ah which would roughly provide 10~12 hours of continuous use on .5a or 5~6 hours on 1a.  Would it be in my best interest to look for something with a slightly larger capacity to ensure continual fan use through out the night? My plan would be to purchase just one to see how well it works and then upgrade to a second if I need to(so I can juggle them).
vandwellers,37s785,monkeywelder,2,Sat May 30 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"That fan has 2 speed settings, that's probably the difference between .5 and 1a that people are reporting"
vandwellers,37s785,monkeywelder,2,Sat May 30 13:06:37 2015 UTC,"Given that capacity, maybe a 7-9ah would do. That's a pretty common size range for alarm systems and UPS's, might even find some second hand if you're lucky."
vandwellers,37r760,Nauti,1 point,Fri May 29 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"What you would have to do is replace the small flame at the base of the back of the fridge with a different heat source. That's how a 3-way fridge works, the heat source can be a 12v heater, a 120v heater, or the propane flame. I was originally thinking you would have to disassemble the fridge and mount some parts remotely because your wood stove puts out MUCH too much heat for this, but I'm wondering if you might be able to use some sort of copper heat pipe to transfer the heat from your stove to where the flame is now. Heat pipes are used to transfer the heat from CPUs in laptops to the fan, are very efficient, and MIGHT work for something like this if the stove was relatively close to the fridge, maybe (emphasis on maybe). Probably more work than it's worth though, unless you're doing this as an experiment and have the parts laying around."
vandwellers,37r760,BigandStupid,1 point,Sat May 30 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"If you're stove has a water jacket,  You could run a coil around the ""boiler"" on the fridge.  Find out what the required temperature is though.   would also want it to switch automatically if the fire got too low.   If you need higher temperatures than water will give you,  you can make heat  pipes."

With that in mind I'm choosing to go for a mercedes sprinter or a volkswagen crafter.   As the van is also going to be your home I think it is worth spending a little more on it so it won't be stuck in the mechanics if somthing goes wrong.   As for duel fuel, fuel prices are a bitch. So if you're travelling around a lot, it might pay to have LPG at the cost of less space in the back, as LPG is usually half the price of Petrol.  While I'm currently out of the country, I'm researching what van would work for me at the moment. So I have no personal experience as such yet, I just know what van would work for me  Good luck!"

I live in Italy, so I can tell you how it works here and maybe you can try to verify if it works this way by your parts. Here you have to have a van(technically a camper) within legal parameters that being a shower plate of 50x50cm and a window on the passengers side or on the sliding door that is 40x60(check online the measures cause I am not sure) and then you go were the burocracy is made like were you do documents has ID cards and tell them you want to liv in your camper, then they will send an inspector to see if your van provides the conditions to be considered liveable, then the city will give you an adress on a fake street(were most of full timers on tht city fakelly live). That is how it works here and that adress is valid as a true one to use in any document that needs an adress and btw having your van inspected and passed as liveable makes the  insurnce go down a littl  more than half."
vandwellers,37pozs,CapitanHarlcok,2,Fri May 29 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting situation. Are these specialist insurance companies or is it a general thing?  From my phoning around today they all seemed to want to know where the van would spend most of its time, which obviously I can't answer. Without that they gave a clear ""no"" unfortunately"
vandwellers,37pozs,sarautu,8,Fri May 29 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"Okay - I'm 'Murican, so in that sense I have no idea.    But I've worked in a job where I tell people ""no"" a lot.  No, that doesn't fit our rules.  No, you need these forms.  Computer says no.  No, you must follow this procedure.  No, you must find some solid alternative.    What I've learned is that there are usually loopholes if only the consumer knows the right question to ask.  Sometimes I haven't pointed them out because I don't want to loose my job by suggesting something outside of the customer's inquiry (did you ever see that scene in The Incredibles where Bob Parr helps Mrs. Hogenson?  It's like that), but sometimes it's because I'm just not thinking on all levels to help the person in front of me.    If you come at the problem from 20 different directions, you might find one I can tweak and we (the ""no"" person and the consumer) can actually find a ""yes"" that will work for this situation.    So try to think outside the box.   Ask your local council  (ha.  ask the council of the town you grew up in, or that you're currently parked in, or of any big city) if they can assign you an address like the Itallian guy suggested.    Try to walk into an insurance office early in the morning with a box of treats (doughnuts?) and a smile.  Chat them up as far as just being friendly and telling them about your situation.  Tell them you're trying to come up with some idea that might serve as a temporary solution.  (Could be that would work into a permanent solution.)   Be open minded. Ask leading questions.  Shut up most of the time: let them do the talking.     At my ""no"" job, I can't count the times I've tried to ask the consumer leading questions to get them to walk down a path I'll be able to help them with a workable solution.  So be open to the questions that people are asking you.    At my ""no"" job, we didn't verify addresses.  The consumer thought we would, but we rarely did.  If we did, the consequences weren't dire, we'd just make them update the address on file.    At my ""no"" job, we understood that sometimes people lived with a cousin for a while.    Even if the companies you have called have told you ""no,""  try to think of different questions you can ask, or take a different tack.  Try to go back and ask again.  Slowly.  Softly.  With an open mind to where the clerks may be leading you."

vandwellers,37pozs,ijustwantanfingname,1 point,Sat May 30 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm in the UK. I don't know for sure but this must be fairly straight forward. Most insurance policies have information about going abroad, how long your covered for etc. I would imagine that you would need to use a friend or parents address to register the policy and then check the information about travel. I can't imagine they would insure a camper without it being obvious it would be used for camping? Otherwise how do all the retirees get about with their motorhomes? I lived on a boat for a couple of years and always used my parents address for my insurance and if anything had happened to my car which it didn't, i'd have told the insurance I was on holiday on my boat, as it's clearly stated I use my car for leisure, and I never signed to say it was at my parents 365 days a year. I did have to call breakdown out once which was registered at my parents as well and just told them I was on holiday. No problem there. Obviously I'm no expert and have the knowledge of a dog on this, so ring your insurance company, but I wouldn't panic too much. But it is best to research first, as the other thing insurance companies are good at is squeezing every last penny out of you so you don't want to admit to a whole bunch of stuff and get a higher premium when you would have been covered on a normal one. I will check what my docs say and get back to you, I'm buying a van tomorrow hopefully, to travel in.  Edit - my insurance covers me to travel abroad for 30days fully comp. then it switches to third party fire and theft with no limit. I'm just assuming you're thinking of travelling the EU (not just the UK so I might be being useless). If that was the case I personally would insure my car at my parents address and tell the insurance I'm going travelling but when I'm home I'll be there. But if your planning to stay in the UK this is useless for you so I apologise. Also, vandog traveller now has a forum so it might be worth going on there - he's from the UK but in Greece at the moment and the forum is very active. http://vandogtraveller.com/forum/"
vandwellers,37pozs,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Sun May 31 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"my docs from admiral    Aha, I too am with Admiral. I've checked my Documents Portal and only have   Certificate of Motor Insurance Motor Proposal Confirmation Policy Schedule   None of these have the page after page of legalese that I expected. Is that the case for you too?  I think regarding the abroad part, I seem to remember it being about 30 days or something. But that's not especially applicable as, apart from a summer holiday, I intend to stay in the UK.  I've actually rung around a few companies (Coop, Aviva, Direct Line, Tesco) and they all said the same thing - that the quote has to be based on your actual location the ""majority of the time"".  One company that did say it was okay though was Churchill. I specifically asked if it's okay if I have no residential address and use my parents' address as a communication address. They confirmed that that's all they need. So there's hope.  Admiral's quote form covers this, although not quote so explicitly. I haven't yet rung them directly as, like you say, insurance companies are all for using anything you tell them against you.  I'm tempted to go with the approach of just using an alternative address like you did. I'd like to see what the options are though for seeing what companies' policies are on my plans.    What van are you buying? And where are you based? Sounds like you're going travelling abroad, is that right?"

But really, if I was staying in the UK, I would still tell them I was at my parents. Then if anything did happen whilst I was out in the van I would tell them I was on holiday when I put happened. I guess the burden of proof is to prove that you don't live at the house full time, and that you are 100% living in a van. I imagine it really depends on if you have a job where you are in your van, if youre in one place all the time, if anyone can prove the fact you are not living at your registered address. When I was on the boat I realised that unless someone was there to check every single day and photograph that I didn't live at my parents then I was fine. Insurance companies can't assume you spend every day of your life at your home address. I guess you need to clarify what 'majority of the time' means, as when I lived in a boat the authorities didn't allow living full time, but when I questioned what this meant I found it actually meant anything over ten months of the year. So maybe the best thing is to ring up and enquire with the insurance as a ""possible new, not existing"" client and ask what 'majority of time' means, push for an explanation, maybe tell them you are planning on travelling in a camper for a while and don't want to invalidate the insurance, I usually do that when I want to ask something without them putting notes on my insurance. Tell them you don't want  to give your address at the time or anything as you are really just enquiring on thier policies and your not looking to sign up for anything, if they won't let you do that then just use a friend or work address to get through the the babble. I'm a bit reckless really though so I'm not great for advice, as if I was staying in the UK I just wouldn't change anything and wing it, because I don't see how they could prove I hadn't left my mums a week, a day, or a month ago. Also the thing about 30days fully comp, The rest third party, I got from a forum, I need to call and double check that."

I know it has to be possible because I know ppl w nice caravans who live in them full-time and are older responsible adults and have them insured to the hilt and the vehicle itself is their permanent address (somehow. Dunno how! They are in Germany so YMMV). Maybe not mentioning you're gonna live in a van might help?  Just looking at it from a different angle.

I suppose I'll check and see if the company is reliable/does returns.

vandwellers,37ojgx,outforsnacks,2,Fri May 29 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"I posted this device in another thread last week. It's an indirectly evaporative cooler which means it dehumidifies and cools the air at the same time. If you would melt ice directly in the air you are cooling, you'd also raise the humiditylevel which results in a lower cooling experience then you would expect. This device however, should not raise the humiditylevel in your room, it even lowers it besides cooling the air.  I'm confident this device should work well, but if you can afford $500 for devices like this, you should question what you are doing in a van or you are a luxurious vandweller (which is fine aswell). I think the device would be better suited for tinyhomes and the reason is because tinyhome owners spend about 30k on their builds (about 30k if it fits on a small trailer to avoid legislation). If i had a tinyhome on a trailer (a 30k palace of luxury living), i'd buy this device for sure as it gives me luxury of cooling, even off grid."

I really wanted it to work! I had 10 pounds of ice in the cooler and tested it in my car. The car was in the shade and at 85F and 60% humidity, the ice lasted only an hour. The air coming out from the radiator was cold, but the temperature in the car dropped only 3 degrees, making it 82F...not comfortable. I haven't found anyone with this kind of setup that has worked well.  It might work if the car was insulated, but I don't want to spend $200-$300 insulating the car for something that MIGHT work.   Best of luck."
vandwellers,37ojgx,outforsnacks,1 point,Fri May 29 13:56:58 2015 UTC,I wonder if dry ice would be more effective but you would need more ventilation. Those types are most effective if they are blowing directly at you rather than trying to cool an area.

The other option was reusable cold gel packs. Like, a lot. Some last up to eight hours, and we could combine it with a small thing of dry ice to help them last longer. I am worried we wouldn't be able to find a place to freeze them though."

Unfortunately, we won't have that in the woods."
vandwellers,37ojgx,broiled,1 point,Fri May 29 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it dehumidified, almost as well as a regular compressor A/C. I had a drip tray below the radiator and slanted one end of the radiator [EDIT: one end of the drip tray was slanted down, not the radiator] and in the downward end I put a tube that led back into the cooler. My hour trial-run saw drips from the radiator into the drip tray about 4 minutes into the run, and there were drips every few minutes into the tray (mostly in the first 1/2 hour).  That tells me it works and is dehumidifying...but only as long as the ice lasts, and even then it doesn't cool the car much. I'd love to see if insulating the car makes a big difference and could make this setup possible. But insulating a car is expensive...anyway, I hope this helps in some way."

But really, with the dogs, I think both the pop up and the van are too small.   If I were in your shoes, I'd pick a small travel trailer, and use my Ford to haul it around.    the advantages of this in your situation are:  * you don't have the mouldering mess of the smelly pop-up conversion * you can leave the home parked while you tool around in your truck for short jaunts while boondocking * you can chose about any floorplan that works for you and your dogs * they're cheap, both to buy (especially used) and register * people get all excited if you have to leave the dogs in the van while you run into a restaurant, but somehow worry less if you have to leave the dogs in the travel trailer for the same amount of time with the same amount of water/ventilation * you mention you're not very mechanical, and the travel trailers come with air conditioning, batteries, inverters, solar panels, water systems, etc.  already installed.   just pick your amenities and then learn how to maintain them."

If you don't have to spend much time in the city, then it's really whatever suits the two of you best.

If you were connected to services in an RV park in the boondocks you would most certainly not be boondocking per the general usage of the term, which is why I made the point.

In my opinion that's the only way you'll have enough room for 2 people plus 2 big dogs to full time. You have a lot of size options; high tops, extended wheelbases, and different weight capacities. The initial cost is a lot more than with a conventional van, but the resale value is too. If you're handy (or your wife is) I think you should be able to do an acceptable conversion for less than 20k, including a used van.   A Sprinter would give you more space, better gas mileage, access from the front (which you wouldn't have in a trailer or pop-up), better stealth than a trailer or pop-up (if that matters to you), and better drivability than a trailer.   You want your initial experience to be positive or you won't stick with it. Fighting a too small space will make that difficult.  Good luck."

vandwellers,37jnlh,monkeycycling,1 point,Fri May 29 04:47:16 2015 UTC,"Well my build has consisted of much more than what is shown in these pictures, but about 5 months so far..   Originally, I intended to rebuild a tin top Syncro (4wd vanagon). This van I'm building now was just a cheap van I bought to get me back to FL and to use while I build my other van.  When I got back to FL, I started doing the engine conversion on the Syncro body, but I came to the conclusion over time that it's body was just too far gone with rust. (was an ex New England van)   I went forward with doing the engine swap in the Syncro but decided once I got it running, I'd then tear it apart and swap all the 4wd components & the engine to the van I bought in Denver. The Denver van was a western van and has a very solid rust free body.  I ended up doing the rear half of the 4wd/engine swap (engine, syncro trans & syncro fuel tank)  Getting to this point took about 3 months by the time I did the mock up in the Syncro body then eventually swapped everything to the Denver van.  After this I happened across a beat to hell pop top westy van for $300. I had toyed with the idea of eventually doing either a custom hi-top build or a pop top conversion. I ended up going forward with the pop top conversion at that point which meant cutting the roof off the donor van then cutting the roof off the Denver van and welding the Westy roof and doing the pop top swap.  This took about 2.5 weeks or so..   Since then I've been building out the inside of the van with it's camper interior and doing misc things here and there. Like a few days ago I grinded out all the old seam sealer from the body seams and redid them to make sure rust doesn't start eating the van away.  All in all it seems like 5 months is a lot, but I've done a ton to this van in that time and the first month and a half I had been focusing on the rust bucket syncro.."

You might want to attach wooden batons to the struts, and then attach the panelling to the batons, it would probably make it easier. Also insulate it with either rock wool (messy, itchy, cheap) or insulation board (more expensive, easier to work with) maybe use expanding foam to fill the back door panels, although that stuff is a nightmare to work with, or if you can remove them stuff them with insulation. Once you have attached batons to the walls (if you do so) and filled every space with insulation (including the ceiling) you should line all of it with some plastic sheeting to act as a condensation barrier.

You could put in your own manual switch that you would have to flip when you want the batteries to be connected, or maybe do both..  That way your house batter could ""jump"" the main battery if it never needed to.   And, yes.. the house battery needs to be grounded to the chassis, just like the first battery, otherwise it won't charge..   tldr; you need 12v and ground to the Solenoid in order to Close the internal switch which connects the 2 big posts.   Some solenoids only have a single small connector for 12v as they get the ground via the solenoid chassis."
vandwellers,37m8w7,turnoffable,1 point,Thu May 28 18:06:11 2015 UTC,thanks.  So what do I connect the 12V to? Somewhere in the ignition? I thought the 12V would be coming off the positive terminal of the van battery to one of the big posts and grounded through one of the small posts connecting to the engine block.
vandwellers,37m8w7,turnoffable,1 point,Thu May 28 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"Not unless the wiring diagram for that solenoid you have is different than any I've personally seen...   Every continuous duty solenoid I know of has 2 ""switch"" connections (The 2 big connectors) and either a small connection for 12v and another for ground OR a single small one for 12v AND it gets the ground from the chassis of the solenoid...   (Ford Starter solenoid is different than above)  Soo,  assuming you need a 12v and ground run ""to"" the solenoid (that's what it looks like to me) to energize it, just ground the solenoid to the chassis and run a small wire to one of the small control connections from the same bolt that is holding the solenoid onto the chassis.    That will take care of the ground signal for the coil side of the solenoid.    Now for the power, for a test, just take a piece of wire and connect it to the other small control connection on the solenoid and touch it to the + side of the battery.  The Solenoid should click.   Now know for sure that putting 12v to that spot on the solenoid will close the connections...   Now for a decision..  Either find a circuit (fuse)/wire somewhere on the vehicle that only has 12v when the vehicle is running OR run a wire with a fuse to a switch inside the cab and manually flip that switch when you want to allow the batteries to be connected.   I'd say the 12v on run circuit method is the best so you don't have to worry about forgetting.   When you take that 12v (from some other circuit, or through a fused wire/switch) and get it to that last connection on the solenoid the solenoid will close when 12v is present."
vandwellers,37m65m,Plethorgalg,2,Thu May 28 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"Get some in person help from somebody that knows what they are doing.  It is not complicated.  But if you screw up 12 V wiring, you will start a fire or get burned on hot wires.  The most important thing is to have a low amperage fuse (5-10 amp) right near the battery terminal, so that when you get the inevitable short circuit, you don't burn down the house.  It will work fine for years without this main fuse, but it will be very risky and insane.  Not good unless your name is Jesse Pinkman.  At least get somebody to check your work."

vandwellers,37lg4y,BaywardBoondocker,1 point,Thu May 28 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"To take that analogy further.  Yes it might be capable of putting out air (electric) at a higher pressure (amerage), but if you restrict the aperture (amerage demand) the volume of air moved (wattage) is the same.  To rephrase, if it comes out faster, that has to translate to a higher wattage, or else where's the energy going. This could be explained in terms of higher voltage (13V rather than 12V). But the resultant energy, in watts, has to be the same.  If the appliances aren't demanding that higher amperage, why would it discharge from 100% to 90% any faster than 90% to 80%?"
vandwellers,37lg4y,outforsnacks,2,Thu May 28 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"Just in case you don't know, discharging your batteries below 50% capacity will greatly decrease the life of the batteries. The lifespan is pretty much correlated to how deep the batteries are discharged."

Guy had to move it quickly so took it for $1500 and fell in love with it. Im going on a roadtrip later this summer and thought itd be the perfect vehicle. As we started doing mechanical work however I came across a few problems. The first was that the total underbody was rusted out. Thought that wasn't too big of a problem until we came across the carburetor. The carb needed to be completely re-done, not being too technical I figured it wouldn't be too much of a problem but talking to people they all advised me not to take this van cross country because when you drive a carb run car up elevation it needs to be retuned and most car mechanics don't even work on carbs anymore. So wed have to find a place before we drove up the elevation and again when we left. All in all it looked like we were going to have to invest almost 4-5 grand to make her stable enough for our trip so we flipped her on CL. I was really upset because the van was so sweet but honestly after all the reasons Ive listed we didn't have a choice. So honestly I was just curious about your van and the trip you wanted to take.

vandwellers,37k07p,warm_n_toasty,3,Thu May 28 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"volume = 3.14*r^2*L  r = radius of pipe. if we go for a 4"" internal diameter r=2""  If we say length of the pipe, L = 6' = 72""  volume = 3.14*4*72 = 904 cu in = 4 US gallons approx.  The slope of the tube will give you a negligible increase in pressure. pressure is calculated by density of water*g*h. Height is the only variable so the higher the tube is than the spout, the more pressure you get. Obviously you cant really mount it much higher than the roof of your van so youre basically stuck with what you get pressure-wise."

Buy a boat foot pump.   http://www.defender.com/product.jsp?path=-1|51|2234226|2234237&id=1125818  The marine consignment store near me has them as low as $15 - you'd probably have to take it apart to clean and lube, but they're bombproof.   Have the pipe gravity feed to a small collection container the pump draws from. Install a ball valve at ceiling height so the water won't drain out of the roof pipe until you want it.   Here's the thing - you have a small window during the day to shower, because the same surface area that heats it up will leach energy as soon as the sun is gone. I stayed at a place in Haiti that used this system, and even there the warm water window was just about noon - 5, a time when you feel like a cold shower anyway.   This won't work unless you're in socal, South Florida, or during summer."
vandwellers,37k07p,warm_n_toasty,2,Thu May 28 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"good idea. You could, but with a straight pipe filled to the top the volume of air would not be enough to give you a constant increase in pressure. the initial burst of water would be powerful but as the air space inside the pipe increases from you letting out water the pressure of the air would decrease. Maybe you could mount a pressure pipe next to it to get enough volume, but I wouldnt want to pump that thing up to pressure every night before I showered."

vandwellers,37k07p,Not_Joking,3,Thu May 28 10:37:53 2015 UTC,"oh goody, more maths time :P  as the volume of the water wont change while its being heated we can use P2/P1=T2/T1  We 'know' T1 and T2. starting temp, T1, is water from the stream in this example = 5 degrees C.  T2 is the ending temp of the water after being out in the sun. We shall say it gets to 70 degrees C  P2 is final pressure, P1 is initial pressure (atmospheric).  Note we need to use Kelvin in the this example so add 273 to both T1 and T2 ;)  so the equation above becomes P2 = P1(T2/T1) = 101KPa*(343/278) = 101*1.23 = 124.23 KPa final pressure.  Pressure increase = P2-P1 = 124.23 - 101 = 23.23 KPa = 3.3 PSI increase in pressure.   Basically bugger all really."

I'd use smallish bore metal pipe (15mm/ 1/2inch or smaller) and lots of it. Maybe larger bore flow/return manifolds with a network of smaller pipes between? Big bore pipe holds more water but won't have enough surface area to get it properly hot and plastic pipe will be too insulative. Providing it's supported at least every metre it shouldn't sag (I'd recommend rubber lined munsen style clips).  As long as there is some kind of a fall from the flow to the return it will gravity feed, but it will be slow and you'll have to be careful as to how you park. Pressurising it will work for the first few seconds but you need something to replace the water you are using. You can get 12v water pumps fairly cheaply I think but bear in mind the higher the flow rate, the less heat it will pick up on its journey.

What I've learned on YouTube:     Consensus:  don't park in the same spot twice in two weeks. Come at dark, don't goof around (sleep, don't do things to draw attention to the van, including watching t.v.) and leave at dawn. Take care of your toiletries somewhere else.  (Lotta people get talked to by the po po when doing their morning ablutions in the same spot they camped in.)   Most common suggestions:   ""Blue"" roads (roads that aren't much traveled) Natural/Federal land (allowed to park 14 days of any month, as long as following guidelines) residential streets, but not where you'll be psyching anyone out (where it'd be okay to see a Van parked, as if maybe they're visiting a neighbor) Some Walmarts  (see all-stays website) Some rest areas (see all-stays ap) Some public parks, especially in small towns.   (Some are posted: no overnights.)   Most people who have YouTube vids say that if the police do knock on your window, be polite.  If they ask, let them know that you are moving around right now, and ask them if they know of a better place you could park where you'd be out of the way.      One YouTuber said:  If they ask, say that you DO NOT consent to a search.   She felt violated after, and was pissed that they threw all of her stuff willy-nilly without care.    I get the idea it's really important not to defecate in the van, or at least not let anyone know you ever do.  I get the idea that pee is okay, sometimes, but that it's more often illegal to transport/carry/have possession of poop.....

vandwellers,37h2cj,Bouncer827,1 point,Sat May 30 20:01:05 2015 UTC,my dog poops in a bag and somehow its not ok for a human to poop in bag. doing thru hikes people are often required to poop in human waste disposal bags to eliminate impact on the local environment.
vandwellers,37h2cj,DyHydrogenMonoxide,1 point,Sat May 30 22:59:49 2015 UTC,That's the rule on caving trips too. One of the main reasons I haven't been tempted by the multiday survey trips.
vandwellers,37h2cj,coinaday,1 point,Sun May 31 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"I agree but the issue comes down to others perception especially authority figures because like it or not they exist and have to on occasion dealt with. Dog waste also dries and solidifies within a day or two, diapers absorb moisture from babies poop but humans pooping in a trash bag can carry contaminates for quite a while, composting happens and is safe but takes time. Many municipalities have had issues with homeless people going wherever and it causes a public health issue when an officer meets you he doesn't know you he doesn't know you care about the environment and would never dispose of your waste improperly to him your just another homeless person, he's more worried what disease he could catch from you and bring home to his loved one's after his shift."

vandwellers,37h0pc,lexpython,2,Wed May 27 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I always look at few of the US vans and think that they would be great for conversions (the older ones, not for fuel consumption though) and I'm a Brit. That said old Merc Sprinters can be very cheap here. Truth is that I think that is the best condition Vario I've ever seen (apart from the UPS vans), and there are a reasonable number around here. 99% of them are old, high mileage and rusted to hell. That is probably why the asking price for this conversion is £18,000 (approx $27,500) for a 16-year-old van...  EDIT: Also, fuel economy isn't that great for the Vario compared to the Sprinter. Double back wheels are a nuisance in campers IMO. You need to buy an extra pair of tyres when you need new tyres. You need to have it MOT'd at a commercial vehicle specialist, something you don't have to do with single back wheeled vans. This costs more money."

Perhaps I'm being unfair to those areas, but it seems that it would draw attention/scream wealth and lead to theft.   Sailboat would be amazing.

vandwellers,37eccr,olfitz,1 point,Wed May 27 01:56:50 2015 UTC,That's a pretty small tank right? Do you carry extra fuel?
vandwellers,37eccr,VredYarbles,1 point,Wed May 27 16:20:23 2015 UTC,Yes we do.  It runs about 4 hours on a tank. We carry a 2.5 gal gas can up on the roof rack.   We generally camp one nite and move on which charges the house batteries so we only use the generator when we stay more than 24 hours in one spot.
vandwellers,37eccr,olfitz,1 point,Wed May 27 16:51:08 2015 UTC,"That was kind of my question.  If I'm going to have a gas can outside, I might as well do the same with the generator."
vandwellers,37eccr,crockett5,0,Wed May 27 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"That guy we had here as a mod for awhile whom was very annoying. He did at least have a good suggestion in rearguards to generators. That being built a 12v generator using a small engine & an alternator.  Despite him being very flaky on other things, that is something that he did get right.   This is an example of a really well built one. The nice thing is you can use a very small engine. Like a weedeater engine as in this example or a little 2hp edger engine.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7D44i8cJYo  If you are handy this is something you could put together in your van while on the road if you have a small amount of resources. You could have a local welding or machine shop build you up a nice custom mounting plate.   If I ever go the generator route I'll be going this way."
vandwellers,37eccr,warm_n_toasty,3,Wed May 27 03:11:27 2015 UTC,"very cool, but that sounds horrendous. the good thing about proper generators is the amount of stuff they have added to them to make them as quiet as possible."
vandwellers,37eccr,crockett5,1 point,Wed May 27 03:15:46 2015 UTC,That's just because it's using a 2 cycle engine. You can use a more conventional 4 stroke like a quiet Honda engine.

vandwellers,379prp,skillDOTbuild,4,Tue May 26 00:41:05 2015 UTC,The back portion of the Transit Connect is pretty much gonna be all bed if you want to be comfortable.  Best thing to do is to build your bed platform so you've got 1-2 feet of clearance underneath for storage -- or however much clearance you need to fit what you need.  Or have seating that can convert into a bed -- but there's really not enough space for both a bed and other stuff unless the other stuff is underneath the bed platform.  Like so and like so

vandwellers,379prp,idapitbwidiuatabip,2,Tue May 26 01:01:44 2015 UTC,I'm not sure -- if you're 6ft you should just be able to fit.  But I imagine diagonal sleeping is what you'd end up doing just for more breathing room.  Don't know the exact interior dimensions of the Transit Connect offhand.  But yeah a fold-down desk on the side of the van would be a great solution for that.  You can also consider swapping out one of the seats for a captain's seat that can rotate backwards and make a workspace that way.

Business trucks are usually kept in pristine condition with zero personal clutter in sight. If you can actually pull that off, more power to you. In my experience (living in a SoCal beach city with a generous population of vehicle-dwellers) simply adhering to the local parking laws and using common-sense in choosing spots is a far more successful way of avoiding trouble.  One of the locals is a guy who lives in a conversion van on my street. He works as a car salesman at the dealership around the corner. His van is kept tidy and he moves it at least a car length every day. Every other week he switches to the other side of the street. None of the neighbors care, we're all familiar with him, and because he has clearly educated himself about local parking laws, he doesn't attract the attention of PD despite the fact his van is very obviously his home."

vandwellers,377gbr,vtjohnhurt,2,Mon May 25 19:21:49 2015 UTC,"Chicken tax:       The chicken tax is a 25% tariff on potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks imposed in 1963 by the United States under President Lyndon B. Johnson in response to tariffs placed by France and West Germany on importation of U.S. chicken.  The period from 1961–1964  of tensions and negotiations surrounding the issue, which took place at the height of Cold War politics, was known as the ""Chicken War"".   Eventually, the tariffs on potato starch, dextrin, and brandy were lifted,  but over the next 48 years the light truck tax ossified, remaining in place to protect U.S. domestic automakers from foreign competition (e.g., from Japan and Thailand).  Though concern remains about its repeal,   a 2003 Cato Institute study called the tariff ""a policy in search of a rationale.""   As an unintended consequence several importers of light trucks have circumvented the tariff via loopholes—including Ford (ostensibly a company the tax was designed to protect), which imports the Transit Connect light trucks as ""passenger vehicles"" to the U.S. from Turkey and immediately strips and shreds portions of their interiors, such as installed rear seats, in a warehouse outside Baltimore.

vandwellers,377gbr,fluxofapathy,2,Mon May 25 16:30:35 2015 UTC,"Looking at the numbers from this site, it looks like it'd be near $3000. A lot less than I thought, especially for a van that costs over $70,000."

vandwellers,376tro,sprinterstuff,7,Mon May 25 10:23:48 2015 UTC,"if you're concerned about the high expense & continual waste of constantly buying replacement gas canisters or feel at all uncomfortable about contributing to fracking or petroleum extraction: denatured alcohol stoves are actually a great option, very under-rated in my opinion. they're compact, lightweight, inexpensive, easy to maintain, and you can find denatured alcohol cheap in pretty much any hardware store, even in very rural places where camping stove canisters or white gas might be hard to come by. i honestly don't understand why people seem to prefer fossil fuels based stoves to denatured alcohol, which burns every bit as hot as any gas stove.  also you might consider picking up a ""solo stove"", which use small sticks, twigs, and the like for fuel. then you'll NEVER run out of fuel. actually i often use my solo stove as a wind guard / clean burn enhancer for my denatured alcohol stove, an awesome combo which boils water very quickly, overall cheap, clean, highly portable, environmentally benign, and reliable.  alcohol stove:http://www.amazon.com/Solo-Alcohol-Burner-Backpacking-Camping/dp/B008VZ91WO  solo stove:http://www.amazon.com/Solo-Stove-Wood-Burning-Backpacking/dp/B007DBD3IU"

vandwellers,376tro,Living_4_Me,2,Mon May 25 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"I like a simple Coleman two burner. Simple and less setup than my camping stove. I keep my Dragonfly around as a backup (it's tiny and fits in with my cooking gear) but at some point I may consolidate and get rid of it.   As for meals, I don't do anything special food wise, but I do have a couple of twists on how I cook.  To save on fuel I cook rice in a vacuum thermos. At some point I'll try beans in there as well. It uses a lot less fuel than cooking in a pot, and the cleanup isn't too bad.  I've got a Coleman oven and I've experimented with it for baking bread. It's tough to maintain an even temperature with it, and it's only about the size of a big toaster oven, but I think with a couple more tries I'll be turning out tasty fresh bread. I'd like to be able to make cookies, but I'd have to do so many batches it would be a waste of fuel and a hassle."
vandwellers,376tro,lshiva,1 point,Mon May 25 14:14:21 2015 UTC,Not vandwelling yet but I think I'll get the MSR Dragonfly. Plenty of options for fuel and you can simmer as well. A bit loud out of the box from what I read but you could make it really quiet by changing the cap or whatever it's called.
vandwellers,376tro,SuperPW,1 point,Mon May 25 11:36:42 2015 UTC,Walmart has a pretty cheap butane stove. It's just 19 bucks and works pretty good. I picked one up when I swapped vans last year on the road and I'm planning to use it in my new van.  It seems to cook faster than my previous propane stove did. The only draw back to it is when it was extremely cold last year (talking below zero) I couldn't get it to light up.

It boils a pan of water pretty fast, and the ring is broad enough and stable enough for anything from a kettle to a frying pan. The bonus for small living situations is that it packs away nice and neat in its own box and it's a fraction of the price of pretty much any other set-up I've found in camping shops. I'll almost certainly keep it when I move into van life full time, everything I cook is a one-pot dinner so I don't need any more rings. Admittedly it's not ideal for hiking with."

The lady only left because she started getting aggressive with customers and employees who parked near her, and someone notified the property management.

vandwellers,3767w5,cliffdweller67,1 point,Thu May 28 03:40:55 2015 UTC,Dude one canister of propane does not have enough hydrocarbon energy to bring down a structure.  If anything they would get made due to insurance reasons if you blew up your van or suffocated in your sleep due to a leak.
vandwellers,3767w5,Bouncer827,1 point,Thu May 28 15:26:10 2015 UTC,I asked this same question and some good points came up. The issue with carbon monoxide is something to consider. Also garages are expensive. I live in a city where you cannot park in any garage without paying upwards of 30 bucks a day! This is more than days rent on a room rental. Since I live in a city with a marina this is where I found the best place to stay without any problems. Busy cities are easy to blend in on the street.
vandwellers,3767w5,Bouncer827,1 point,Mon May 25 17:52:36 2015 UTC,Security will catch you most will have you leave if you refuse it's trespass. Don't risk it I worked in a parking garage for five years. The garage I was at had security patrols every hour hour rom 7pm to 3am every night. Then maintenance came in at 5am mon- Fri not to mention police patrols. Find somewhere lower profile.
vandwellers,3767w5,Bouncer827,1 point,Wed May 27 15:49:09 2015 UTC,How are you trespassing if you are a paying customer for the lot? My typical ironclad excuse is that i'm 'meditating' not sleeping in my van.  Which is very hard to disprove.
vandwellers,3767w5,badluckbritt,1 point,Wed May 27 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"Actually you are not trespassing if you leave when and if asked. If you are asked and refuse then. We had no loitering signs. Of course half of the people I asked to leave had no idea what loitering meant. We had issues with vehicles being vandalised drug dealers and overdoses, homeless taking up residence without a vehicle, minors hanging out smoking cigarettes throwing pennies at people from the roof, adults throwing beer bottles at passers by from the roof etc. I have more stories of crazy than you can imagine."

The thought came to mind when my grandpa got one for his shoulder.   It has the benefit of being a closed/non-evaporative system which is better in humid climates, and you could probably DIY one using a ~5w 12v PC cooling pump and an igloo to circulate the water through one or two cuffs around your feet.  The hardest part would be DIYing the cuff, but maybe you just buy one or two since the rest of the build is fairly inexpensive.     The question marks are how big a cooler you'd need to get through the night and getting the temp on your feet just right, but those can be solved with some trial and error.  Grease a low-wage palm at a hotel or restaurant to let you fill up with ice once a night and you're good to go."

Their results seemed far better than yours though.  Are you using the big blocks of ice and keeping the ice in a container to insulate it from the circulating water?  They say ice lasts for days and will cool a rig down to where you're hoping for.  You might be circulating the water too fast or too slow too.  I wouldn't mess around with medicine, put it in a cooler to be safe.  I don't know of any low power compressor type A/C's, but what another poster said, do park in the shade if you can.

The radiator was on top of the cooler so the hoses were only 18"" to 2ft long. The car was in the shade and at 85 degrees and 60% humidity, all the ice had melted within an hour and didn't really cool the car much.

vandwellers,374rk6,RiverVan,1 point,Mon May 25 20:54:12 2015 UTC,Some people use silicone or other sealants that can leak.  Most RVers use Dicor self-leveling lap sealant for their roof vents.  I used it around the roof vent in my van years ago and have never gotten a leak.  http://www.campingworld.com/shopping/item/dicor-self-leveling-lap-sealant-white/32125
vandwellers,374rk6,4vox1,1 point,Tue May 26 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"I'll be installing the exact Maxxfan unit that you have linked.  It is replacing an old age fantastic vent fan with a crack in it.  We'll see if the switch is worth it.  My only other experience is a fantastic vent model with rain sensor and auto lid.  The rain sensor had a tendency to trigger lid closure from humidity.  The lid motor mechanism also came loose and fell off all by itself.    Back to the maxxfan, I read that this model in OPs link can be used with the lid closed,essentially acting as a traditional  ceiling fan.  This is beneficial to those with thermostatic controlled propane furnaces because it will circulate the heat within the van more evenly.

vandwellers,374rk6,nixsee,2,Sun Jun 14 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Forgot to follow up!  The maxxfan blows away my old fan.  I leave it open nearly all the time since it's hot now.  A freak downpour swept over my area while I was working, I had no fear with it being open.  When I came back, the van was totally dry inside.  Works as advertised.  The mechanism has two lift arms, so it doesn't rattle in crosswinds.  I leave it on automatic temperature mode alot and it varies speed to maintain setting.  The reverse air direction feature has been useful when running my generator to keep fumes out of the van.    Worth it."
vandwellers,374rk6,kenbw2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:17:40 2015 UTC,"So I installed the maxxfan a few days ago. I don't have it hooked up to electrical system yet, but just having the hole in the roof cools it down considerably.   Install was quite easy - marked where I wanted on the inside, drilled the 4 corners, hopped on the roof and cut it out with a jigsaw. Used butyl tape and sikaflex 705 to seal it. It has withstood a couple of extremely heavy rain falls so far with zero leaks, and that is while leaving the hood OPEN! The all-in-one design of the maxxfan deluxe just makes so much sense. It is the reason I got it over the fantastic, and it has worked even better than expected."

The fuel injection measures barometric pressure with the map sensor only once at startup. So if you drive to thinner air the cpu is using incorrect information. If you stop and shut it off then restart it has a new set of inputs to use.   If your truck has a mass airflow meter disregard this. This is only on map sensor ford vehicles.

vandwellers,371ukw,crockett5,2,Sun May 24 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Laptop charger draws about 60 - 90 watts. If she's using it for 8 hours a day, that could potentially be over 100% of the capacity, depending on the season and part of the world. There are solar charts that list sunlight hours per day. You may have sunlight for 12 hours, but it will be weak in the morning and evening. You might get the equivalent of 6 hours of full sun. You also need extra capacity to fully recover on that one sunny day in a rainy week. In my opinion, 100 ah sounds like it should be enough storage.  Where are you getting the panels? Prices vary quite a bit."
vandwellers,371ukw,frothface,1 point,Sun May 24 12:56:39 2015 UTC,"You don't leave the lap top plugged in the full 8 hours. It has a battery for a reason. You plug it in for the hour or so it takes to charge then run the laptop off it's battery for the next 4 hours.. If you live off battery power then you make adjustments to how you use power. You don't just leave the stuff plugged in 24/7.. You charge it then run it off the internal batteries.  Also if the laptop is being charged during the day while the solar is working, it's really not using much battery power. As the sun is replacing what is used at that moment. The only time the laptop charging would really be a drain on the battery, is during overcast days when there isn't enough solar to replace whats going out and at night."
vandwellers,371ukw,frothface,1 point,Sun May 24 14:52:42 2015 UTC,"I hear this all the time but it is a farce. Many battery chemistries, such as nicad and lead acid are capable of dissipating heat when overcharged, so the chargers are set to over charge for the purpose of balancing the pack and offsetting lost charge while they are idle (it also simplifies the charge circuitry). for those chemistries, this can be true depending on the usage cycle. Lithium batteries OTOH absolutely cannot be overcharged (the separators break down and the battery shorts and starts on fire). Also, lithium batteries have very low self-discharge compared to other technologies, making float charging unnecessary in the short term. It is not possible for the charger to put more energy into the battery, and being a switching power supply means that the consumption is very proportional to the load, whether it is charging or just running the computer. Batteries have storage loss as well, so it is less efficient to charge one battery off of another one when you could just power the load directly. This is why batteries get warm when you charge or discharge them. A charger left plugged in does continue to draw current, but it is only supporting the load of the still running phone or computer. I hear this all the time and I don't know if it is just people parroting what they hear or if it is an intentional act to cause users to inflict extra cucles on their batteries, but it is absolutely not true.  Edit: Last night, I plugged my galaxy s3 in at 19% and measured the current draw. It had run for 11 hours 8 minutes on a 7.98 wH battery. At 3.8 volts, this translates into 2100 mAh, of which I used 19%, or 1701mAh in 11 hours. This works out to an average, real world load of about 155 mA. I went to bed at 96% charge, but it had already used 12.2wH to recharge the 7.98wH battery from 19% to 96%, or about 77% of it's full capacity. This should have taken about 6.14wH, so that process is less than 50% efficient. I tried to take a photo of my meter this morning once it was fully charged and idling, but unfortunately taking a photo uses significantly more current than idle. It's rapidly fluctuating between 90-160mA of draw with a fully charged battery, which is right in the window of the actual average current draw of the phone when it is running off of it's internal battery, and it had used 22.2wH. Here's the difference - it runs for 11 hours and took 12.2wh to charge, and used another 10wh to run for another 11 hours, remaining fully charged. If I had disconnected the charger last night, it would be back around 19% and would need another full charge, for another 12.2wh, for a grand total of 24.4wH, not far off from my actual 22.2wH. The difference is negligible, but I would have put the relatively expensive phone battery and charging port connector through an additional cycle, as well as having to constantly monitor the charging cycle and possibly wait for my phone to charge a 2nd time."

It's not extremely sensitive at the low end of the scale, but it was within a few 10's of milliamps compared to two other dmms that I have, and it accumulates amp and watt hours over time as well. I incorrectly assumed earlier that the battery efficiency was low (50% combined). I found that pretty surprising because lithium is supposed to be fairly low. Now that I think about it, it's actually probably much lower and the majority of those losses were probably in my 12v to 5v converter."

The fridge is propane so it doesnt draw much power right?  What draw does fan have, if its a fantastic fan its fine...mine never stops running lol.  But if you hit some clouds, or in winter season, you might want to have more battery or a backup charging method.  try to do the heaviest activity (laptop work) during midday so solar is compensating.    Also, keep the laptop close to charged, rather than discharging it low and trying to get it back up.  It will sip juice this way, rather than suck it to bulk charge.  My laptop is for gaming and sucks lots of juice, at night it will run my batteries low but during day my 200 solar handles it fine and still charges batteries."

vandwellers,371ukw,nixsee,1 point,Sun May 24 03:40:48 2015 UTC,"and to my knowledge the fridge does not draw a current on propane   There is one way to tell for sure:  Does it have a power cord and if so, does it stay cold if you unplug it?"
vandwellers,371ukw,Sehc,1 point,Mon May 25 08:58:04 2015 UTC,"Parking in the sun during the summer to have power to work in the van for 8 hours a day in the sun and heat sounds like torture to me.  You want an absolute minimum of 200w solar for a 100ah battery.  That van is going to be an oven if it's parked in the sun all day, and if it has the insulation package it will be radiating heat all night too.  If you could keep the solar portable, and put the panel in the sun and the van in the shade, that might work.  Depending on your particular RoadTrek, you might be fortunate enough to have the once optional inverter generator also.  Those would charge the house battery system in very short order, no solar panels required.  Those generators put out high amp 12v to charge the house battery.  If your rig doesn't already have one of those, I think I would investigate one of those before deciding on solar.  I usually charge my laptop for a little under an hour a day to get 6-7 hours of use on it.  So your charging needs for it may be less than expected too if it's not on charge for the full 8 hours a day.  Whether you go with solar or not, make sure you have a good backup generator with battery charging capabilities.  If you can't afford both, choose the generator first."
vandwellers,371ukw,kenbw2,1 point,Sun May 24 05:16:07 2015 UTC,Think about the climate/location you live in too. I'm in the UK and on a sunny day my 100W gets me about 3-4A during the day (more if it's angled towards the sun). But a cloudy/rainy day dips it to more like 1A
vandwellers,371ukw,fhghg,1 point,Sun May 24 10:34:57 2015 UTC,"If you have limited funds, a small generator and one 100 AH battery is the best place to start (this assumes that you camp in a place where you can run the generator).  When you have more money, you can start adding solar panels and batteries and gradually reduce your generator run time.  At some point in the future with lots of batteries and solar panels, you might just need to run the generator every three days or so.  There are a lot of variables and unless you want to over design (and over spend) upfront, you'll need to let your system evolve over time based on practical experience.  Keep a log of when you run each device.  Log the charge state of your deep cycle batteries at least once a day.  Get a panel mounted voltmeter ASAP and monitor the charge state of your deep cycle batteries (isolated from the engine battery) http://www.amazon.com/RioRand-Digital-Voltage-Voltmeter-7-5V-20V/dp/B005UWD2J4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1432463767&sr=8-3&keywords=panel+mount+voltmeter  This will tell you the charge state of your deep cycle batteries.  The battery manufacturer will have a chart that maps no-load voltage to charge state.    Your batteries will wear out quickly if you rapidly discharge them and/or run them down to a low charge state.  Don't run all of your devices at the same time.  For example, turn off the fan when you're running the water pump.  Even with deep cycle batteries, it is better to never run them down below 50% charge state or so.  This is why you want excess batteries.  So for a 100 Ah battery, you should only use 50 Ah and save the other 50 Ah for emergencies.  As you wear out a battery, it will hold less Ah.  There are a lot of factors that will cause a 100 watt solar panel to put out significantly less than 100 watts.  Clouds, panel orientation, and high temperature are the big three.    Clouds - if you have a day of overcast, then you will need more batteries to tide you over.  Orientation - Mounting the panel horizontally will work pretty well in the summer, but much less efficient in Spring, Fall, and Winter (unless you're in very low latitudes).  If you're camping, you might think about positioning the solar panel on a stand away from the van.  You will have unacceptable transmission loss if the wire connecting the panel to the batteries is too long or thin (but 100 watts does not required a terribly thick or short wire).  Thick (heavy gauge) short wires are best.  Be extremely careful with any wires carrying twelve volts that are connected to a storage battery as a short will quickly start a fire and/or burn you (I have a nice scar from grabbing a shorted and smoking 12 V wire).  For any temporary extension cord charging situation, it would most safe to remove the solar panel and the battery from the van.  Make sure that you have the lowest possible amperage fuse (say 5 amp) right at the battery terminal.  If you blow this fuse (sans short circuit), you're probably running too many devices simultaneously.  Temperature - Power output will drop with high temperatures of the van roof.  To minimize heat buildup, you'll want to park the van in the shade or put a sunshade over the top.  Running the van engine to charge the deep cycle batteries will take hours of run time.  It is not going to be a practical or satisfactory solution even in the short term."

Part of university is social and vandwelling isn't too conducive to inviting people over to hang out. It's also a bit distracting as you spend some time with van things instead of university things.  If you are really wanting to do it, I would suggest an opposite approach, to live more traditionally your freshman, sophomore year and transition into vandwelling junior or senior year.

There is a lot of police presence there so I would recommend keeping a low pro if you stay in your van (stealth). I got roused by a cop during the day sleeping in my car. A lot of the neighborhoods around sea cliff have loads of parking but I would roll in late and leave early to avoid detection. This is where I slept when I did car living for awhile. I also slept at end of cult de sacs downtown. West cliff area is okay, but the drive itself does not allow for over night parking and there are loads of people. You might be able to rent someones driveway or spot on their land by the Univ and take up bike riding. Stay away from the state park parking, hwy 9, hwy 1 parking lots. Or maybe some college kids who have extra space for parking. There is lots of mountain land in that area so it almost seems possible to rent a little spot and then use transit and bike like most students. I admit it's been quite a few years since I have been home so these suggestions may be obsolete."
vandwellers,371t7r,kNOwagora,1 point,Mon May 25 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"There is a spot on west cliff that a good 15-20 vagabonds will be parked at any given time, along with maybe 5-15 van/rv dwellers, and then a bunch of home bums camping. Very good spot, people usually respect space and privacy while being friendly. The only time police come is when home bums are being stupid. I lived in SC in 2012-2013 and the police that year did a bunch of raids on campsites looking for people with 2/3 of the ""homless charges"" needed to get them any time, like if you're homeless and lay on a bench or side walk, get caught 3 times, you get some stupid charge. But I've been at a camp and just said I wasn't homeless, been sitting on the ave away from my vending stand, and never ever get hassled, unless home bums show up, then I get asked to leave and just say "" whoa I'm NOT home less, and im working currently, and just conversing "" and I get told sorry.

I could very easily live in this full time and if anything changes (which they always do, I've learned the hard way) I'll have a safe, comfortable home.

I'm happy about that. On the inside a bit of light does bleed in as you can see, but the exposure turned up on my phone camera so it looks much brighter than it actually is.   10 magnets was way too little. I'm gonna buy 20 more from amazon and that should be good.   The fabric was $20 for 10 yards at jo ann. It seems to be the perfect amount, moreso if I cut it for specific window sections instead of just wrapping it all the way around.   I have a tri fold futon coming tomorrow from amazon too.

vandwellers,36wif4,mytimeistoday,2,Fri May 22 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"This is kind of a non-issue question, which might be why someone else hasn't jumped on it.   The isolator is just designed to disconnect your house batteries from starting batteries, while allowing them to be charged together when designed to. The current passing through the isolator (which is just a relay), is going to be limited by either your recharging source (alternator), or load (inverter).   It would take a very beefy house load to overwhelm the isolator and pull too much power from the starter batteries, although if you are pulling a full 3kw inverter load, that will be 250 amps getting pulled. If your house and starter batteries are tied together, you will need to run 4/0 (or whatever appropriate for 250 amps for X feet) between house and starter battery.   Now, the other 99% of use cases, where you have a fridge and fan running, and batteries aren't abused, the cheaper 80 amp relays would be just fine (call this your ""on the move"" setup).   Basically if you don't plan on combining your two battery banks at full 3kw load, and have your ""on the move"" load when you flip the switch, a basic 80 amp would work fine, especially with the stock alternator (which yours might not have).   To be honest it isn't a huge gap between 80 amp ($16) and 500 amp ($72) relays, I would recommend stretching the budget for such an important piece of equipment."
vandwellers,36wif4,pillowpants80,1 point,Fri May 22 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"Diehard RV batteries are like marine batteries, not quite deep cycle. Why you need a 3000 plus watt inverter is a question, but I would chose a bank of 6 volt golf cart batteries connected series/parallel to get 12 volts at high AH. 3K watts will pull over 275 amps from a battery if available."
vandwellers,36wif4,Sehc,1 point,Sat May 23 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"I would be rethinking my electrical needs, and completely eliminate any need for an inverter.  For the isolator, a battery shop would be where I'd get advice."

Most of the time, I'd have a pretty expensive bike with me - one that I don't want visible and just a few seconds away from becoming someone else bike when some guy with bolt cutters decides he wants it. I've never been comfortable using bike racks..  I don't want to put it on the roof for the same reasons - plus with a vent and solar panels I don't think there'd be much room for it anyways  EDIT - and also - thanks for writing your vandwellers guide book.

Option 3 makes the most sense if you must store your bike within the van, otherwise do option 2 with outdoor storage for the bike.  You'll have drawers under the bed that you can access from the back & front.   All of those are fancier than what i lived in for 2 years. I had a very comfortable but basic setup."
vandwellers,36vorx,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Sun May 24 05:13:08 2015 UTC,I don't think I would mind blocking that side door too much.. but.. I would have one back door blocked with the bed and now one side door blocked - so there would be no wide entry into the van.   I think I would like how option 2 does not block the back door - so I could lay on the bed or sit on it and look out the back. (I'd try to make the bed so It can be folded up into a couch both ways - forwards or backwards)
vandwellers,36vorx,warm_n_toasty,2,Sun May 24 18:48:47 2015 UTC,I like option 2 the most i think. option 3 would be good if your doge has that one big door at the back.
vandwellers,36vorx,DazarGaidin,1 point,Fri May 22 20:41:27 2015 UTC,I don't have one big door on the back - it's two doors. They can open very wide though (like the newer Transit or Promaster doors that swing really far open so the back opening is not obstructed at all by the doors)
vandwellers,36vorx,DazarGaidin,1 point,Sun May 24 03:13:08 2015 UTC,oh fair enough thats pretty good. The only thing I can think of is that if someone is walking down the street as youre putting your bike in they can kinda see into your van. Its a bit harder for them to do this when you load/unload through the side. Thats just what Im thinking off the top of my head.

Remember you need enough clearance for doors to swing(or make them slide sideways!)"

I don't plan on putting a ton of insulation back there, so I think it would work pretty well sleeping sideways. I'd just have to get used to not putting my arms up past my head.   For the first layout, I think I'd have to make the bed narrower for it to work. I was mapping out the layouts in side the van today (using tape on the floor and sitting things to fill up the space that will be occupied) and I noticed my drawing was a bit off relating to the first layout - that much of the galley would have to extend further into the van (because the inside of the door is 4"" further in than the normal wall, something I didn't have right on my template)   I only laid the tape for the first design though so tomorrow morning I will mock it up and see how it feels"

I have a couple months left at my job in Fargo, ND and here I spend more time in town than out of town. I get long weekends every weekend so as soon as I finish up I load my bike up and head out of town to a forested minnesota lake for the weekend. So here I probably spend about 30-40% of my time in town. Next winter I will be heading down south and as soon as I hit mountains that will probably go up to about 75% of time spent out of town.

No more trying to constantly hide what I'm doing, because I am no longer considered to be homeless, a criminal, or both.  Now I'm simply a harmless, friendly camper, a threat to nobody.  It's amazing how much people's attitudes change according to what you happen to drive.  I guess it's all that stuff on TV where the bad guys drive cargo vans."

My solar panels were stolen while I was in a walmart store, and nobody I could find saw anything, or at least they didn't want to get involved.  It got caught on camera, but the truck had the tailgate down so you couldn't get a license number.  Waited for over 2 hours and the cops never did show up."

Obviously lots of great outdoors, climbing, hiking, mountain biking etc. Library with free wifi (Canadian mobile internet very expensive with miserable data caps) and ability to charge your electronics. Plenty of lakes and rivers to bath in. But also cheap options to shower at the local rec centre. Lots of other nomadic climbers around so you don't stick out and it's easy to make friends. I'm very excited because I only have 5 more weeks left before I fly back into Canada to get my van out of storage and do it all again.

There's so much space I can't wait to sleep in it for a night.   It takes getting used to driving. I've run off curbs and such a few times now. parking is a bitch. No regrets still though. There's not much hood so it drives a lot different from a car. The last car I had was a few inches longer but a lot of that was the mile long hood so this handles a lot less fun than that car did.   It's been taking around $55 to fill up and only gets the typical 300-400 miles a fill up
vandwellers,36tjco,dokupehakase,1 point,Fri May 22 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"Being a former cargo van dweller, I can tell you that you don't want one.  I switched to a high top former shuttle van with windows.  The perception of strangers and cops went from somewhere between homeless or criminal to harmless camper.  My cargo van was extremely well insulated, and it seemed to work exactly the opposite of how I wanted it to work.  Hotter in the summer and colder in the winter.  My current high top window van has no added insulation, and in fact the inside of the high top is just bare fiberglass, yet it is much easier to either heat or cool than my heavily insulated cargo van was.  In the summer that insulation radiated the heat it had collected during the day all night long and there was no way to even cool the inside down to match the outside temps.  In the winter it held the cold in and radiated the cold all of time costing me at least double if not triple as much as it does to heat this uninsulated one.  Inside sleeping temps are important to me, and I spent more nights than I wanted sleeping outside with the bugs when I had that cargo van because it was too hot to sleep in.  This has never happened with my current van."

Yeti 400 they use 400wh  WTF is a WH? No one in the solar industry use WH that I've ever heard of.  They are attempting to mislead you into think it's 400ah (amp hours) which is a very common term in relation to batteries..  If you look at the specs of the Yeti 400 it's only 33AH. Meaning there is zero chance that you will meet the goal of running a 12v fridge off that system.   They want $500 for a cheap charge controller in a fancy box and a deep cycle motorcycle sized battery.. You have to buy the solar panels separate.   That system would be ok for charging your lap top, running some lights and small stuff like that. Running a 12v fridge isn't gonna happen.   The only thing I can even figure out as to what 400wh means is that converting 400 watts to amps = 33.33 which is the amount of Amp hours of their battery. Again the 400 is absolutely useless because why not just say 33AH? Why because 400 sounds better for marketing.. 8)   /end my rant about GZ. lol"
vandwellers,36sh6v,crockett5,6,Thu May 21 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add.. Solar looks confusing, and I was confused as well when I built my first system. It's really not that hard though you just need to figure out the basics of what you need out of a system.   IMO if you want to run a 12v fridge you should have at minimum 200AH of batteries and 200w of solar. To run that you can pick up a cheap 15-20amp charge controller.   It's really as simple as running the wires from the solar panels to the charge controller then from the charge controller to the battery. You will of course want to ground the batteries to your van body and  maybe a ground  from the charge control to the body as well, depending on the charge controller.   That is the basic of what you would need to do, in order to charge your batteries by solar.   Additional things to do, would be add a easy disconnect between the solar panels & the charge controller. This way you can stop power from getting to the charge controller in case you want to work on something.   After this all you need to do is wire what ever power outlets you need in order to run what ever you want to run. It's best to fuse each of these on the positive side. Most auto parts stores have cheap fuse blocks which work perfect. You run a single positive wire to the fuse block, then run each of your positive wires to what ever you want to power though that fuse block.  You can also ad a voltmeter and something to monitor how much charge you are getting. Some of the charge controllers have meters which plug right into them, making it very easy.  I wanted to add.. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzNGe4RIH2pFybPJgIIAp3hXsdVmpDgKf  Watch some of that guy's videos. He has some nice easy to follow videos on setting up solar systems. If you watch his vids you will probably be able to build your own system with out any problems. You will likely be a little lost of what to buy but, that's normal and it's stuff that we can help you with."

vandwellers,36sh6v,DyHydrogenMonoxide,1 point,Thu May 21 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with your rant about watt hour. Wh is the total energy in the battery. Ah is inconsistent across the board of electronics. For example 3Ah can be different things from say a cell phone, to a laptop. Wh is voltage times amps. So of course a 3.7(nominal) voltage phone with 3,000mAh(11.1Wh) battery will have less capacity than a 12V 3,000mAh(36Wh). This is why laptops are using Whr over Ah."
vandwellers,36sh6v,setsar,2,Mon May 25 05:01:26 2015 UTC,"It was more a rant about GZ. While wh might be a legit term, no one in the solar industry uses that term. It's clearly being used because fort people with no knowledge of solar (their average customer) 400wh sound much better than 33ah..  The simple fact is they tend to take advantage of people's lack of knowledge of solar then sell them ridiculously over priced systems."
vandwellers,36sh6v,crockett5,1 point,Mon May 25 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"I have no objections to the price of GW although I would like to see Wh being used as a standard. I see it as a metric vs American Standard debate. Because people aren't educated with electronics, we shouldn't dumb it down just because the masses don't know. If you wire 2 solar panels(or battery) in series, it will still produce the same Ah. But the voltage is doubled. An educated consumer would know that the wattage is double but if we keep pandering the idea to standardize Ah, then we are not really helping the consumers. Yes, GW are highly overpriced."

I would try and find that cat a new home unless you're going to be around all the time.    plants do not consume oxygen, they consume carbon dioxide during the day through photosynthesis and create oxygen, so you don't need to worry there, it's good for you!   good luck!"

Photosynthesis consumes 6 molecules of CO2 and emits 6 of oxygen and 1 of glucose.  Respiration is essentially the reverse, but since plants respirate at a slower rate at night (otherwise, how would they grow?), there is a net gain of 2-3 molecules of O2 per day-night cycle.

Depending on the city you're in, that could be a problem with the cops. In the city plain white cargo vans with either no back windows or totally blacked out back windows are overlooked as commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles often get left random places and cops are used to seeing them and they're basically invisible in that aspect. Vans like Ford and GMC are cheap and easy to repair by any regular mechanic. VW repairs cost more and are more likely to happen(speaking from experience).   If you're in the country or parked on a private location with no threat of law enforcement, any van will do.

vandwellers,36lst3,I_PET_NEKOS,4,Wed May 20 10:41:44 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about a working holiday, Australia has just announced that people on WHV's will no longer be able to declare tax residency. So instead of getting the first $18k tax-free like tax residents, you pay 32.5% income tax on all earnings, from the first dollar. It takes affect from July 1 of next year, so if you were on the fence, get in while the getting's good.  :("

But I imagine that you are still able to claim all of the tax back when you leave which if you have worked for 1-2 years will come to quite a hefty sum."
vandwellers,36lst3,Mr_Kaputnic,2,Wed May 20 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"In theory, with the old system I think you'd need to be around 6 months and then file for tax residency, and later get refunded on previous tax paid when you file income taxes. The employer was probably complying with the letter of the law in those cases.   I've found nothing to suggest you can apply for a refund when you leave under the new regime; the previous tax refund schemes were centred around going from non tax resident to tax resident (see above), which will no longer be possible on a WHV. If you could get the tax back when you left, I don't think there'd be any point in the government implementing such a system.   edit: Of course, you can still apply for a superannuation refund when you leave, but super contributions are paid by the employer on top of one's wages, not deducted from them."

The laws are pretty awesome, in most towns there are places where you can stop and stay for up to 24 hours, these places usually have toilets and are primarily at beaches and parks.  Many National Forests have camping areas where you need to pay a small fee to enter and a small fee to camp overnight.

Suddenly most things become about utility and minimalism naturally follows. One of the best benefits is those small decorative items that might remain tend to hold much more value than they had before.  A lot of people jump into a van with a lot of stuff and soon realize what has earned a right to take up space and what hasn't. The majority of people living in McMansions are of course rarely faced with this. Most would rather build an extra garage to house their junk than be rid of it, resulting ultimately in excess waste."

vandwellers,36n29u,s2bh,6,Wed May 20 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"The calculation to work out the duration you can run your fridge for is pretty simple. You already know how many amps it draws on average and that a battery will give you about half the Amp hours advertised before needing a recharge.  So a 110Ah battery will give you 55Ah in the real world. If the fridge averages 3A, you will get about 18 hours operation from a full charge (55 / 3 = 18.3).  It's unrealistic to expect a generator to recharge a battery in an hour. In the example above with a fairly small capacity battery, the generator and the charger sitting between it and the battery would have to deliver 55 Amps. Such a thing does not exist in a form you would want to keep in your van. 10A is a much more realistic output for a charger.  At 10 Amps, a charger will take 5.5 hours to recharge your battery. (Although remember if your fridge is still running while recharging, 3 of those 10 Amps will be used to power the fridge, so a full recharge time is more like 8 hours).  A bigger bank of batteries will give you more capacity and allow your fridge to run for longer between recharge, but of course increases the re-charging time proportionally.  My advice would be to look at a more efficient fridge, and/or work solar into the equation. With a big enough bank of solar panels and plenty of sunlight, you could keep your batteries topped up and fridge running indefinitely. Also, if you're driving around regularly, hook up the leisure battery to starter battery with a voltage sensing relay - that will allow it to charge when you're on the move.  And finally a small but vitally important point: if you put your batteries in series, you increase the voltage each time by the voltage of the battery. So 2 x 12v batteries in series = 24v of output, 3 x 12v = 36v, etc. If you want to increase capacity but not voltage, put them in parallel."
vandwellers,36n29u,jester_hope,1 point,Wed May 20 18:45:04 2015 UTC,I don't think a much more efficient fridge is available for 12 volts. Most users add inches of insulation to increase efficiency.
vandwellers,36n29u,Sehc,3,Wed May 20 20:38:02 2015 UTC,"To make the math easy, lets assume a 50 percent duty cycle.   I am not sure what they mean by ""equivalent"" but assuming that amp hour reading IS correct, (For 34 degrees. sounds about the right temp for most reasonable food storage)   33.3 Amp hours divided by the 24 hour period, times two for the 50 percent duty cycle: While running, it will draw about 2.7 amps. lets round this up to three. So you want to make sure your system can support 3 amps of draw on all the wiring, battery, and charging systems. Now lets figure out how much backup you need:   For a battery like This one  it has 648 AH of capacity. In general, this type of battery should not be drained past 50 percent very often or you reduce the lifetime of it.   so with 324 AH per cell, you can run the fridge for a hair over 75 hours.  Your mileage may vary. It will probably end up being something like two days on battery, depending on if you use the batteries for anything else, what the external temps are like, how old the battery is, How often you open the fridge, what is stored inside the fridge, etc.   What type of generator do you have? It will have to be large enough to both power the fridge and charge the battery packs on top of that, otherwise, it will just not charge the batteries. You may also run into some issues on small generators taking a long time to charge the batteries, which can be a problem for other reasons. (Noise in sensitive areas, fuel cost)"
vandwellers,36n29u,Motocyclemadness,2,Wed May 20 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"First of all, THANK YOU.  The 648 AH battery you supplied is 2v.

vandwellers,36n29u,Sehc,2,Wed May 20 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Very premium deep cycle battery, $$$$. Six are connected in series to have 12 volts. Same with the more reasonable priced golf cart 6 volt battery $$. Two are connected in series to have a 12 volt, 225 amp hour, true deep cycle battery."
vandwellers,36n29u,Motocyclemadness,1 point,Wed May 20 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"My bad, just did some googling.   From a perusal of the local auto parts store most deep cycle batteries appear to be 48 AH in capacity for 12 volt supply.   so ah, 24 Ah, Roughly 8 Hours? maybe 6?   as far as generators, your math when converting the 120 volt output of a generator to the 12 volt for battery charging is...... Complicated.   The Specs on alot of generators are hilariously incomplete, only supplying the wattage (High numbers sell) If you can find one with 12 volt output that would be better (You avoid some messiness of finding a proper charging converter)   These ones From a  trailer supplier have an 8.3 amp output at 12 volts, assuming this is correct,   -Fridge draws 5 amps, leaving 3 amps for battery charge, leading to a charge time of: 14.4 hours. This will obviously be better if you turn the fridge off for that time, but we most likely cant get away with that.   The ideal thing is running the motor: Most heavy duty vehicles have a 200 amp or better alternator attached, which can charge battery banks in quick order. half hour or an hour of driving/idling. (Driving recommended as it will spin the motor faster.)  I would say look about for a generator that either supplies 12 volt on its own with decent amperage, or getting a 12 volt power supply like This   The advantage of going with a power supply is that if the need arises, you can toss an extension cord out the window and hookup to a buildings power.   I would carefully weigh your options before purchase, and make sure the parts are actually rated for the amperage that it says on the box. Also, make sure you use a suitable gauge of wire for hookups between this stuff. 20 Amps can easily blow out thin wires. There are electricians guides online for this stuff, like This one I usually go a gauge up from what i need on my builds."

If only running 6 hours per 24 hours duty cycle, it will have drawn 30 amp hours from the battery.

vandwellers,36n29u,Motocyclemadness,2,Wed May 20 20:32:16 2015 UTC,What about:  2x 100w Solar Panels (12 total amps/h during sunlight-96amps/day) 2x 6v 220AH Batteries in series for 12v 1x 1000w Inverter  (draws 2amps/hr + approx 2amps for any 110v appliances) 1x Fridge  (draws 3amps/hr NOT connected to inverter)   So I am drawing approx 8 amps/hr and collecting 12 amps/hr (with sun). Meaning I am saving 4 amps/hr and drawing 8 amps an hour for 16 hours (128 amps down)   With the batteries at capacity and energy usage starting would this system indefinitely run? I am thinking not. Another panel maybe? Bigger battery bank with more AH?
vandwellers,36n29u,Sehc,1 point,Wed May 20 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Does your fridge have a 120 VAC hookup? If not, converting the energy witht he inverter is not necessary (unless you have other stuff to run)   Solar panels have their own things that require care:  -MUST be kept clean and dry. -Lowers your ""stealth"" -Expensive, so they will be targeted for theft. -Dont work at night or on cloudy days. If you live in a desert, probably not too bad. -May be damaged while driving from road debris, stuff falling from trucks, etc.  None of this is to say its a bad option, I actually adore solar panels. just keep in mind its going to be a little more critical thinking.

The double axle version of the van I'm getting can't be registered as a personal vehicle in some states, including where I'll be, meaning it can't be parked on the street. I imagine this type of legislation applies doubly to box trucks. There are also differences in pricing for tolls, taxes, etc between passenger and commercial vehicles - even if the body and registration are the same, small things like windows can make a difference.   Think about how you'll be using it and make sure you will be able to legally do what you plan to."
vandwellers,36mci6,jackspaniels,0,Wed May 20 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"In some areas commercial type vehicles can be a real hassle to get them converted over to non commercial status, and in some areas it's not possible at all.  Starting with a non-commercial passenger van is certainly the easiest way around the problem, or something already registered as an RV."

vandwellers,36gwi9,yarrpirates,8,Tue May 19 09:30:32 2015 UTC,Can I have a city van + an off-road van?  Unimogs are amazing but a little hard to parallel park.
vandwellers,36gwi9,yarrpirates,3,Tue May 19 10:00:45 2015 UTC,"This is why people have motorbikes hooked on the back of their bus. Or if you're awesome, an entire car in the back with a ramp."

vandwellers,36gwi9,soggyindo,2,Tue May 19 14:55:22 2015 UTC,Sprinters are long (if LWB) but only 1.98m wide.   About the same width as a transporter.  Unimogs are often wider.

vandwellers,36gwi9,renopants,2,Tue May 19 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"The suspension is easy to fix. The gearing isn't hard to fix, as long as you're willing to sacrifice acceleration and torque at the tires, just swap for a taller gearbox.   If you've got the cash you could also swap for a 12 or 18 gear transmission. Now you've got enough gears to have the right torque, and you've got a tall enough gear for highway cruising.... You just have to do a lot of shifting to get there.   Now the fuel economy.... Not sure I can help you there."

vandwellers,36h2wc,ocelotpotpie,1 point,Wed May 20 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"Drat. Looks like that European size is 158"" - that likely translates to enough more room over the 144"" to be able to cram a shower in there without as much hassle.

vandwellers,36h2wc,TheUtomjording,1 point,Fri May 22 05:24:36 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! The culture of building vans here in Spain is amazing, you see them everywhere. If you can read Spanish you can find a lot more here: http://www.furgovw.org  Sleeping sideways all comes down to how tall you are. I saw a company sell a kit that makes the van wider making it possible to sleep comfortable sideways even if you're 6 foot. I'm 6,4 so so I want a proper 2 meter bed and built it for that. There is space for a small shower in the back but not sure if I'll build it, I would have to sit down in it anyway. Well, future projects.   Another big difference is if you choose to go for 2 or 3 seats in the front. One hint: don't buy with the trucker style suspension of the drivers seat. It makes it very tricky to make it rotating."
vandwellers,36h2wc,TheUtomjording,2,Sat May 23 09:59:02 2015 UTC,Does that black cat go with you in the van?  Also is the medium length much easier to park? It seems like the long sprinter would be much harder to find spaces for.

vandwellers,36h2wc,bouldertoadonarope,3,Wed May 20 20:54:30 2015 UTC,What is the brand? Edit: I think it might be branded as this product in the USA http://www.webasto.com/fileadmin/webasto_files/documents/international/marine/data-sheet/marine-datasheet-air-heaters.pdf  I'd be wary of substandard knock-offs because a hole in the heat exchanger would allow Carbon Monoxide to get into your living space.  A hole might develop in the heat exchanger over time.  Seems like the heat exchanger could be pressure tested for leaks (with the heater turned off.)  Overall I would be confident to use a product like this.  It is a small oil furnace and that is a mature technology.
vandwellers,36h2wc,kingshnez,2,Tue May 19 16:48:05 2015 UTC,I would never buy a knockoff either
vandwellers,36h2wc,bouldertoadonarope,3,Wed May 20 02:33:45 2015 UTC,Any similar product for gas? I had looked at these but had decided if I'm going to bother installing a second fuel tank it'll be propane for stove use as well.

vandwellers,36h2wc,NotSoGreatGonzo,1 point,Wed May 20 00:58:48 2015 UTC,Does your vehicle run on petrol?  I think the benefit comes with using an existing diesel tank to avoid the cost of gas installation and certification and refilling.   I like the idea of one fuel for everything. I'm currently looking at diesel powered stoves for cooking.
vandwellers,36h2wc,redditorwhoknocks,2,Wed May 20 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"It does and that's what I was thinking although I don't think it's a possibility in my case. Propane will be the next best thing as it's self contained, readily available, cheap, and has many applications (stove, heat, refrigeration, lanterns).  I've used a diesel stove on a boat before. Liked to smoke a lot but it was kinda fun and doubled as the heater."

vandwellers,36h6ft,soggyindo,5,Tue May 19 10:47:26 2015 UTC,"Great, I've been looking for an opportunity to reply to an Australian oriented question in this sub.  Ok, so my wife and I went travelling for 7 months after we got married, six months before we bought a 1999 MB100D Mercedes  van for $5000 (Not recommended but I'll get to that), it had electricians racks in the back and a divider when we bought it between the cab and the back.  My father in law and I fully fitted it out, using plywood and his wood shop we made a bed base with storage and a cupboard with fold down table for eating/cooking.  We bought a camp fridge (34 litre open top weico) and 4 x 20 watt solar panels, 2 extra batteries and an alternator.  I tell you this to say that if you have the know-how and time I would recommend buying a normal van and doing it yourself.  a) it's cheaper - a fully set up camper will set you back at least $10,000 for a reasonable set up actual camper (think the Britz camper type vans).  2) It's more reliable - The quality of engine and overall condition of an empty $4000 van will be immeasurably better than a camper of the same price.  iii) You can set the van up however you want and it's fun to be able to customise what will be your home for an extended period of time.  In terms of what vans I would recommend and I will start by saying why I would not go with the Mercedes again.  I bought the MB100d off the side of the road, I was in much the same situation that you are: I didn't really know much and I just wanted a cheap van. It ran fine, everything was in OK shape and it was diesel so I knew it would run forever (180K on the ODO). The issue was that, IT WAS SO DAMN EXPENSIVE TO FIX ANYTHING! A new part was at the very least $100 and if you didn't want to take it to a Mercedes Dealer ($100 an hour for labour) no one seemed to know how to fix it.  Our travels were cut short after having to spend ~$1,800 getting the muffler fixed in Launceston because we needed to spend 4 days waiting for parts and having to take it to a Mercedes dealer to get fixed.  I would recommend either: Toyota Hiace - Everybody has them, everyone knows how to fix them and Toyotas are reliable as all poop. One of those econovan or mazda vans - same story really.  And just because I really miss our van here are some pictures.  http://i.imgur.com/cbzA71o.jpg - Pretty damned stealth, our solar panels are housed inside the ladder rack, we would regularly park at playgrounds with public bathrooms for days at a time if need be and noone ever bothered us.  http://i.imgur.com/MwRkRhi.jpg - Inside the van looking from the bed towards the front - We got the blackout curtains which made light not a problem. The walls are covered with thin ply. The cupboard to the right there is also a fold down table.  http://i.imgur.com/xT9024D.jpg - Looking towards the back of the van, the ""head"" of the bed - we had the reading lights installed and had 2 other lights already in the roof (all hooked up to the normal battery system.  http://i.imgur.com/u9VQSbh.jpg - This was our fridge, my wife would sit on it and I would sit on the bed to eat with the table folded own between us. It was hooked up to the solar panels on a sole circuit, never had any issues with power even with extended periods of rain and overcast days.  http://i.imgur.com/nIxR3Tt.jpg - From the back of the van - We had the 300 watt inverter which hooked up to the 2 batteries attached to the started motor, we only used it to charge our laptop and phones, and grind coffee.  http://i.imgur.com/7GTsIE2.jpg - Our solar panels, we installed them ourselves but got our auto electrician to attach all the wiring when we got the reading lights installed.  http://i.imgur.com/yWmCaM2.jpg - With the table folded down, it was very sturdy and attached to a hook in the roof with a carabina(?).  http://i.imgur.com/4bQ75Ks.jpg - Side shot of our table  http://i.imgur.com/oO4PzaY.jpg - Glory shot, the annexe was just a tarp attached to the roof with the bolts that you can just sort of see in the solar panel shot.  Any questions please feel free to ask, I really miss travelling and seriously some of the best times of my life, no responsibility, nowhere pressing to get to and being able to stay in the same place until the next shopping trip forces you to re-enter society.  Hit me up for any cool camping spots as well, we really only did East Coast (Coffs Harbour to Tassie). But have also driven the Newcastle to Cairns trip a couple of times.  Hope I haven't been too tangential from the initial question and good luck with your vanning."

vandwellers,36h6ft,lukeausj,1 point,Wed May 27 23:30:16 2015 UTC,"It really depends, I think the thing to do is to ensure that you check it over pretty well for any possible defects, if you don't know much about cars yourself bring a friend who does.  I think a van buying from a private seller around $5,000 will get you a decent van, high miles and will probably need some work.  Not sure about your situation but you could live in your van full time or if you are just using it part time for weekends and stuff it might not necessarily be something to dive into immediately.   2 things to consider: 1. If you were living in your van full time you could potentially be saving $150-$250 a week (depending on where you live) in rent, power, and gas. All Unis have pretty good computer access, mine had a number of 24 hour internet hubs and you can shower at the gym, friends houses or beach. For a slight inconvenience in terms of limited internet and access to showers your van could pay for itself in a year in savings. 2: While a van may seem expensive they hold their value, we bought ours for $5000, spent maybe $4000 on it as well as 50,000 Km and still sold it for $10,000.  Where are you studying?"

vandwellers,36h6ft,Boilais,1 point,Thu May 21 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well there is a couple of things: Don'T get a backpacker van, unless you feel really comfortable assessing the condition and the people. A lot of backpackers don'T even do the basic maintenance stuff (like oil changes) regularly.  If you're looking for an all around van, I'd recommend a Mitsubishi Delica Spacegear 4x4 or a Toyota Hiace 4x4. Gives you the van roominess and the offroad options. (Though some parts can be tricky to find for the delica, but basic maintenance is not a problem and very easy to do yourself. A DIY oilchange is gonna run you about 50-75 bucks each time(including oil filter) (and that is throwing away the oil catching bucket.)   I'd say a good Delica or Hiace should run you at least around 5k, if it'S cheaper... then look very closely.  If you can get one with a western autralia registration that is a bonus (cheapest rego and easy to renew)."

vandwellers,36h9m2,DGiovanni,1 point,Tue May 19 11:25:26 2015 UTC,"It all depends on your budget and what you are planning to put in the back of it. If the van is overloaded a smaller engine will burn just as much fuel as a bigger one. On the other hand if you have a very light setup a bigger engine will go through more fuel.  If you are working on a small budget I wouldn't get too picky and focus on buying something that has a power train in good shape and is safe to drive rather than finding specific features. If you have money to spare, personally, I would always go with a bigger engine."
vandwellers,36h9m2,frecel,1 point,Tue May 19 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"There are people that have money to spare? If so, I would really appreciate everyone to send their spare funds to me via PayPal...  Please?"
vandwellers,36h9m2,frecel,2,Tue May 19 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"If you are working on a super tight budget here's how you buy a vehicle.   1) Befriend a mechanic, you can often lure them over with beer. It's nice to take an mechanic with you when you are going to see a vehicle you might potentially buy. A somewhat experienced one will be able to to fairly quickly spot things that are wrong with the vehicle and tell you approximately how much it might cost to fix.    2) Tires are important, and expensive. Be weary of buying vehicles with bad tires, check if there is any tread left and if they are not weather checked. A set of new tires might cost you over $1000, used in a good shape probably half that.  3) It's best to find vehicles that are very common or share a lot of parts with other vehicles. For example because of the popularity of the F-150 in North America everywhere you might break down you will be able to find some parts for an E-150.  4) Focus on the power train not on the extras. The cruise control is nice, but it's not going to help you if you are going to need a new transmission shortly after getting on the road. A solid V6 that has been taken care of is much better than an abused barely working V8. Make sure the power train is solid, engine idles and revs up properly, the transmission works in all the gears and shifts nicely etc.  Bonus Cheap conversion tip: If you are buying a van that is not already a camper and need to insulate it and build a bed don't go running straight to your local hardware store. People often have left over materials from renovation projects that they will sell for next to nothing or give away for free. It's left overs so it's not going to be enough material to renovate your kitchen but plenty to build something in the back of a van. Check your local classifieds and you might be able to find a  lot of stuff you could use."

I am just curious if that is because they last longer, because more were produced, or some other reason i am unsure of? For my needs a 6 cylinder would be fine. I first thought of converting a minivan, but see that for the same price i can get a conversion van. I have 3 months to find one, so I can be picky.

vandwellers,36cjbj,drunksenpai,3,Mon May 18 08:05:53 2015 UTC,"I'm living very primitively in my van. I don't use a cooler or have a stove. I eat very healthy which is really good for this sort of living. I feel like it is important to wake up refreshed and ready to go. I don't drink either. So for protein sources I buy nut butters, lots of green veggies (farmers markets are great and cheap and good for salads with some oil and vinegar and they are everywhere), protein powders, power bars (low on sugar) and plenty of fresh fruit, seeds and nuts. Also rice cakes/corn cakes, tuna, and the occasional meal out (because who doesn't love that!). Your body doesn't need to consume tons of food nor does it benefit from dairy. I would suggest staying away from sugary foods like yogurt and milk so you are optimizing your intake and you feel full. On a limited budget you want the most out of your food. If you eat this way you never have to refrigerate anything. I live in California and its much more costly here than other states. I also got the sense that you don't like to eat processed foods. You can also get great deals at Whole Foods if you stay aware (yes, believe it!). Sometimes I buy a roasted chicken and eat it for two/three days. Every Friday they run a great deal on something and daily meal deals. I'm not a freak about refrigeration and putting uneaten meat in a zip lock works well. Also Trader Joe's has good deals on their packaged meats/nuts and bars. I hit them up once a week for these things. Cooked grains can be purchased at any Chinese restaurant for a couple bucks. Eating like this also helps keep one very regular and on schedule if you know what I mean. And also because I like to minimize my carbon footprint I might suggest steering you away from wet wipes and paper towels and consider using reusable rags or bandanas which you can do in the wash. Make sure you have a few water containers."

I think Ikea might have decent foam mattresses for cheap, too.   It's a lot cheaper to cook in your van, so I'd recommend a cooking set-up in your van. I prefer a BBQ-size refillable 5-gal propane tank and a stove to keep costs down as much as possible over the long-term. That may not work for you, though. You can get the stove for fairly cheap from Harbor Freight, the tank from Home Depot, but don't get the swap-able Blue-Rhino tanks as they are fairly expensive. Buy your own tank and get it refilled yourself to save money.  I'm mostly vegetarian, but eat some meat. For meat I usually shop at the cheap local Mexican markets. It takes a little experimenting to figure out what you like, so try a few different cuts of meat and see what you like.   A stack of drawers works, but I think I'd go with milk crates if I had to do it again. They are all the same size, you can see into them, and you can store food, vegetables, tools, etc... in them as well.   I think I'd try getting enough crates to make a bed on top of them and having a board on top of the crates to make storage space. I'd probably cut the board into strips and add hinges so I could open it up to get into the crates."

You'll be fine :)  If you have an inverter for the lead acid battery, the LIon battery will keep it Charged. Whether the key needs to be in or the car activated to do all this is a unknown to me!  As for capacity the leaf has a 24 kWh battery and an average home uses about the same in a day for all services. If one was to hook up their leaf to their house it would run it for a day. You will be fine to charge your cell and computer no problem but I would be careful not to pull too many watts from the inverter if it's run through a cigarette lighter. ""Hardwiring"" the inverter to the lead acid battery is the best way to limit anything from burning out or heating up. How much is too many watts? Depends how long and how many watts. I am sure if you stayed under 800 watts that would be fine (you will just need a larger a 1000 watt inverter!) If you pulled 800 watts continuously that would give you 3 days of power, but none left for driving! And to pull 800 watts continuously would be absurd in any case for you situation."

There is also the issues about TRUE sine wave and modified sine wave for the inverter :(. True sine (I think that is how it is spelled) is the best option but much more costly. I will have to do more research on that.  My family likes to watch movies so if we can eventually get a projector we can project to the front of the ev with a white projector drape thing to watch movies that would be really nice. If we could use the sound system of the car to hear the movies that would be even more awesome. Either that or would need a large monitor:( or a large laptop.

vandwellers,36buas,fooljoe,1 point,Tue May 19 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"So this DC-DC converter still kicks in if the car is not 'on'?   No, you'll have to have the car on if you don't want to drain your 12V battery. The Leaf's 12V battery is just like the starter battery of any other car; although you could replace it with a deep cycle battery if you like.  Running a 30 Watt laptop through your cigarette lighter will be no problem at all, but as /u/GeoffdeRuiter suggests, if you want to run any more powerful stuff you'll probably want to connect an inverter directly to the 12V battery - the DC/DC converter is capable of supporting a 1000 Watt inverter just fine, but if you need any more power than that you'll have to devise a way to tap directly into the lithium pack (not advisable.)  By the way, running a 30 Watt laptop for 6 hours consumes 180 Watt-hours of electricity, which is less than 1% of the energy the Leaf's pack can store (roughly 20,000 Watt-hours.) However, leaving the car on means all the car's electronics will also be powered, which consume roughly 200 Watts at a minimum. And if you have climate control on that could consume up to another 1000 Watts in the case of A/C and perhaps 2000-3000 Watts in the case of the heater (or even more if it's really cold.)"
vandwellers,36buas,fooljoe,1 point,Mon May 18 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"How safe is it to replace the lead acid starter battery with a deep cycle? Does this mean the leaf doesn't really need all of the juice a starter battery supplies? I believe the starter batteries are best for providing a huge burst to start the gasoline engine while deep cycles provide less energy but over a longer period of time ?  Would the leaf's dc-dc converter still be able to charge the deep cycle battery properly? I am not sure if deep cycle batteries need to be charged 'slower' than starting type batteries?   Thank you I will install an inverter directly to the battery I just wonder if I should get a pure sinewave or modified sinewave inverter... I will read that link  you gave me throughly though hopefully there is an answer there. I am not sure if I will need more than 1k watts that seems to be quite a bit of power. That is unless I want to run the smallest and most electric efficient refrigerator I can find.... I am still not sure if a high quality cooler + large piece of ice is better or worse than a tiny refrigerator :(. There just seem to be so many different opinions about it. For cooking I don't think I will ever use an electric portable? stove. I think those would probably use a huge amount of electricity. As for an microwave that will likely never happen. I rarely used them before and just prefer a propane stove over them. I do have the crazy idea of installing a small massage bed... called ceragem bed (V3.0) http://basic.ceragem.com/product/product.asp it is pretty small but has done wonders for my spine. I did ask last year how many watts it used, but I can't recall at this time.  I looked at the specs and it says Voltage  AC220V, 50/60Hz     Power Consumption   360VA.     So I will guess that when running the AC it actually runs off the lithium pack instead of the lead battery? Does this mean you can't run the AC unless the car is competely turn on / engine is ready to go?   Since the DC-DC converter can tolerate a 1k inverter would this mean that due to the other electronics of the leaf running (200 watt minimum) I will actually have less than 1k watt available? 800watts or lesss due to the electronics of the leaf being turned 'on'?  -edit-  Okay I read that thread and the guy actually ran a refrigerator, a big one!, with the leaf. That is pretty cool. He also used a pure sinewave so I guess puresinewave is the recommended option?"
vandwellers,36buas,fooljoe,1 point,Mon May 18 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"I believe the starter batteries are best for providing a huge burst to start the gasoline engine while deep cycles provide less energy power but over a longer period of time?   Your understanding is correct. By the way, try not to confuse power and energy. Power is the instantaneous draw of a device, measured in Watts. Energy is power integrated over time, measured in Watt-hours. A starter battery supplies more power, but less energy, than a deep-cycle battery.  In the case of the Leaf, you don't need the high power capability of a conventional starter battery, because basically all the starter battery does in an EV is to ""flip a switch"" (i.e. a pair of high-voltage contactors) to bring the traction pack online.   So I will guess that when running the AC it actually runs off the lithium pack instead of the lead battery? Does this mean you can't run the AC unless the car is competely turn on / engine is ready to go?   Yup (same applies to heater.) Although the Leaf does have a mode where you can remotely start the climate control - or program it to start with an in-dash timer - that doesn't turn the car ""on"" in the traditional sense. Remember there's no such thing as an engine in an electric car. ;)   Since the DC-DC converter can tolerate a 1k inverter would this mean that due to the other electronics of the leaf running (200 watt minimum) I will actually have less than 1k watt available?   I read somewhere in the mynissanleaf forum that the DC-DC converter can actually supply something like 1500 Watts, so maxing out a 1k inverter and sustaining the car's electronics should be fine.   Okay I read that thread and the guy actually ran a refrigerator, a big one!, with the leaf. That is pretty cool. He also used a pure sinewave so I guess puresinewave is the recommended option?   People in the forum always seem to espouse the benefits of pure sine wave inverters (and generators, for that matter), but I don't have the experience with either to know how much it matters. It just depends upon what you're planning to power. If your device has a finicky power supply, then a cheapo inverter probably won't work."
vandwellers,36buas,fooljoe,1 point,Mon May 18 22:34:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for letting me know. Then if it is safe to put in a deep cycle battery into a leaf the extra duration of the deep cycle battery means you would not need to turn 'on' the car as often(To charge the battery through the dc-dc converter) ? I believe you don't want to drain the deep cycle batteries below %50 so the only real way to tell where you are at is by adding some type of voltage meter on to the deep cycle battery and run it inside the leaf? Once you see the value drop below the 50% mark you'd turn on the leaf so he dc-dc converter can charge the batttery? I wonder how long it would take to charge it back up? dc to dc charging ( I think ) allows for some pretty large numbers to re-charge the battery (Lv3 Charging is DC for EVs and the numbers are HUGE). Does the system assume the battery is a starter battery and therefore provides a bigger BURST to the battery for a quicker charge? If so, how would this behave with a deep cycle batttery? Is it better to trickle charge a deep cycle battery or is it okay to burst charge it? I wonder how much power the dc to dc converter sends to the lead acid starter battery...? DC-DC converter can actually supply something like 1500 Watts Do you think the DC-DC converter provides upwards of 1k watts when it recharges the lead acid starter battery?  Regarding the AC unit... you can turn it on with out powering up the motor? That would mean sending juice only to the ac and not the motor? I wonder how much juice it sends to the ac unit and if that power line can be tapped into. such a job would be better for an electrical engineer and I am not one so that will never happen."

And monitoring the 12V voltage would be a good idea so you know when to charge. LeafSpy is a great app for the Leaf that will give you all kinds of details about the car, including 12V battery voltage, through the OBD2 port. If you're shopping for a used Leaf I can't stress enough how important it is to get this app BEFORE you buy one so you can determine how much the traction battery's capacity has degraded in the cars you're checking out.  I can't tell you how fast the DC-DC converter will charge a depleted battery, but it probably does use up most of that 1 kW when charging. Here's a good thread about battery charging / jump starting.   Regarding the AC unit... you can turn it on with out powering up the motor? That would mean sending juice only to the ac and not the motor? I wonder how much juice it sends to the ac unit and if that power line can be tapped into. such a job would be better for an electrical engineer and I am not one so that will never happen.   The big distinction between all the car's modes is whether those high voltage contactors are closed (i.e. the traction battery's ""on""). This only happens when the car is in ""ready"" mode (like ready to drive), when the car's charging, and when the climate control is activated remotely or via timer. Whenever those contactors are closed, everything - including the motor - is ""powered"", but the car's software determines stuff like whether it'll let you drive or not. It is possible to tap into the high voltage DC lines directly, but that's DEFINITELY one of those ""don't try this at home"" kind of things. One of the guys in the forum likes to post this image about that sort of thing."

If you are the only vehicle, they will keep track of you and report to the property owners. Most of the time you will just be asked to leave, no police involved (unless the police find you first). Even parking next to similar vehicles, they might keep notes on company vehicles. If you park on the street near them, it is a completely different story."
vandwellers,369vbr,monkeywelder,5,Mon May 18 00:29:03 2015 UTC,I got the E-250 without the high-top. Obvious solar panels on top as well. Go for it.
vandwellers,369vbr,pseudo_mccoy,5,Sun May 17 20:05:49 2015 UTC,One thing Im learning as well is that if youre in a one license plate state. Park with the plate against something. Police plate scanners are being used more and more to track you.   The idea is that whatever your attempt at being stealthy is the scanner will rat you out.
vandwellers,369vbr,pizza_burrito,3,Sun May 17 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm in a 1-plate state, and I've read about those before but hadn't even considered that.  I'd definitely think about that if I'm in really public places like Walmart.  edit: and the motorcycle on the rack will actually block the plates.  But I'd still like to park with it partly hidden, and more secure."
vandwellers,369vbr,vegasrandall,2,Sun May 17 18:48:37 2015 UTC,One time I nodded off at a park in a two plate state. The cop who woke me up bitched about me having covered my rear plate against an embankment. Maybe he was just saying that but maybe covering your plate can attract their attention too? Idk. Not sure if it's enough to outweigh the risk of being tracked by a plate scanner because I didn't know they used them like that. Is this why I see some vehicles with what looks like tinted plastic over their plates/emblems?
vandwellers,369vbr,Wildernasty,0,Mon May 18 02:39:56 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Those license plate covers began being used with the rise of automated traffic cameras where speeders would be photographed and mailed citations. One problem though... None of them actually work. There was a myth busters episode in which different variants were all busted.  It reminds me of a trend here in Vegas. People have these license plate frames that have ""KOM 674"" inscribed on them. It supposedly stood for ""Kin of Metro"" and gave you a free pass for most moving violations. Needless to say something that obvious is not a thing."

The best part about them, is it looks ""normal"" if your van is parked there night after night because you just appear to be someone whom car pulls to work.

BUT- 2 things I'd be concerned with-   1) It's not very stealthy. This may or may not be of concern.  2) How loud that generator is. Ecspecially if you plan to run it while sleeping (AC/heater). They can be VERY LOUD, as in too-loud-to-think-loud which would be a deal killer for me.   The price is nice barring any major issues  But those are great drivetrains- if it's been well maintained it should run forever without any major issues. I would take it to a mechanic for a once-over (as you should when buying ANY vehicle, even new) and make sure they pressure test the coolant system."

In fact I think they are made by the same manufacturer, but it has option to have fridge & freezer.  link to it  There is also this one which is the same as the edgestar but made by Whynter Link but it's much cheaper.

Then parallel. Lifeline are the best agm batteries.   Whynter is the same fridge as edgestar, but cheaper. You don't need to plug it into the inverter as it is 12v. Lights could be 12v as well.   For the inverter size, add up the Watt usage from rest of your 110v items and give a buffer of say 25%. 1000 sounds like far more than you need.   Consider hooking the battery bank to your alternator so it charges which you drive and you don't have to use the genny as much.

Recharge them at work. to keep mosquitos away, mix listerine with water in a spray bottle and spray the openings where the windows are open to keep away mosquitos. dont think of it as living in your car, because you will be at work all day. Think of it as sleeping in your car to avoid rent, traffic, and save time. Make food at work and shower at the gym. Visit parents on weekends for laundry.

vandwellers,366k98,BaywardBoondocker,3,Sun May 17 01:04:53 2015 UTC,"at number 10, insulation / shade - It was a tedious job getting the insulation installed, but I feel it was worth it. There seems to be a slowing of tempratures outside the van reaching inside the van.  The van seems to maintain it’s own climate even during the mid day I’ll open the doors and it’ll be cool on the inside.  Of course, the first line of defense is shade.. always park in shade or relocate to a region that has a climate you prefer.  number 9 is exterior cameras - When your out on the streets or parks your sharing that space with everyone else in the world.  It’s nice to know when someone or something intrudes on your personal bubble.  We may not own the space, but it can be startling when you hear a noise outside unexpectedly.  that’s why i like to have cameras to see around my peremiter so I know what’s going on around me.  desk with chair - this ones pretty unique to me, as I’ve only seen one other van dweller with one, office camper out of chille.  His videos where he shows his setup are awesome.  It’s one of the nicer builds I’ve seen on youtube.  I love the desk and ergonomic chair to allow me to be comfortable when sitting in front of a comptuer for hours.  I find myself editing more video and overall more productive with this desk setup than I would if I was just sitting in a bed without proper posture.  This is just a quirky unique build that fits my needs.  mr buddy heater for cold days is great to keep my feet warm while I work on the computer. The vent fan I own has a temp gauge that automatically turns on the fan when it gets to a certain temp like 72 degrees.  When I turn on the mr buddy heater, it heats up the space, and then the fan exhausts to make sure I’m getting fresh air circulated, because it is propane combusting after all.   It’s also a really nice upgrade to get the hose for a 20lb propane bottle.  reflextix curtains and no light leak - I love the idea of being stealth.  solar panels and batteries  phone with fast internet a memory foam or comfortable mattress toilet roof fan"

My bike lives inside for the time being. great for stealth, shitty because it takes up basically two whole walls at the moment that I could use for shelving. Ive just got it tied up against the wall to the rear of the passenger side and the front wheel is turned sideways along the rear wall. It can be done for sure, I just need to think of a way to incorporate bike/shelving/bed etc. It makes it a bit easier because I'm a party of 1. If I had someone else living in here with me it would be very difficult to find room for a bike.   Im tempted to take out the passenger to give me a bit more usable room. Just had another thought actually and with that done fitting a bike in would be fairly easy. hmm, brb gonna bust out the sketch book :P"

vandwellers,366k98,Seascan,1 point,Sun May 17 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd do differently is the floor. My van came with a perfectly good rubber mat but I over did it and added OSB, plastic sheeting, linoleum, and then some floor tiles in a doomed attempt to insulate. Should have either stuck with the rubber mat or learned to do the floor proper with moulding or whatever so dirt doesn't get caught under it. I hope it's not all mouldy under there already.  Installing mount points on the floor, walls, and ceiling would be a massive improvement for me. Some kind of retractable steal loop would be ideal for attaching cargo nets, hammocks, baskets, or whatever. I may do this later, but it would have been nice to get it done up front. I have a lot of floor space and having a few mount points to hold down cargo nets would go a long way in keeping loose things like boots and water jugs from sliding around.  I thought using Great Stuff spay foam would be an easy and effective way to insulate selected wall/door panels. Nope. Terrible, messy idea. And some say the stuff rots unprotected metal but I haven't seen evidence of that yet.  I'm looking forward to seeing your build progress. Good luck!"
vandwellers,366k98,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Sun May 17 09:03:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding your floor, I take it the problem is you attempted to insulate without using any actual insulation product (ie some type of foam)?"
vandwellers,366k98,nixsee,1 point,Sun May 17 20:32:19 2015 UTC,Pretty much. But I was going more for stability and durability. I'd read insulating the floor is futile but figured the layers would count for at least a couple R's worth.

vandwellers,364vx6,sph_ear,3,Sat May 16 16:25:14 2015 UTC,Here's some tips I decided on for my shell. If you plan on painting use truck bed coating it works really well and looks nice too. Use copious amounts of weatherstripping otherwise you're gonna get a lot of leaking. Mine tended to leak towards the cab of the truck around the slide window. Get some caulk and caulk shit up! Silicone which is typically advised ended up being a way more expensive sealant for my shell. Oil your windows cause I'm sure they're bone dry if they slide and if you plan on framing the inside use cabinet wood cause it's easy to rig together. I used self tapping screws with big ass washers to hold my shell to my truck I have no experience on the kind of things people normally use to hold shells on. A large cargo basket on top can be a great help with storing cargo and not wasting your space. If you have any questions or anything feel free to message me and maybe we can swap ideas or something! Nice to see another truckdweller here
vandwellers,364vx6,CatBawx,2,Sat May 16 13:38:37 2015 UTC,What type of oil do you advise for the windows?
vandwellers,364vx6,CatBawx,2,Sat May 16 15:19:34 2015 UTC,Really any just any kind of lubricant and no WD-40 isn't a lubricant and can actually make it worse!

I was hoping there was some sort of rubber or foam insulation I could just stick under the cap, instead of caulk, but I'm sure I'll end up doing both. And yeah, the damn windows are so dry I couldn't budge the one stuck open. Will lube them up once I finish cleaning. I don't think I'll end up painting it, as it's supposed to be white and my trucks white. But bedliners a great idea. It lasts forever.  The usual cap clamps seem pretty cheap on amazon, as long as they'll fit, I have to measure. If they don't I'll try out the bolts."
vandwellers,364vx6,batshitcrazy69,2,Sat May 16 23:21:34 2015 UTC,Thats awesome man! maybe we could meet up and talk about our builds one day. I live in Stevensville.   Yeah it's called weatherstripping you can find it at any auto store and its pretty cheap. I just cleaned my bed/shell out the other day I took my truck to a car wash and blasted it all out with the pressure washer and it cleaned up real nice but some things like windows you're gonna need to reseal if the shell is as old as mine.   Damn that thing is supposed to be WHITE? that is dirtier than I thought.  I was initially going to use the cap clamps but found that they take up a tiny bit of space and its just another thing to hit my knee on. That and I wanted to seriously have this thing on my truck to prevent any leaking as I have a twin sized mattress in there with bed sheets and everything currently.

I use the i3 window manager (my tiling WM of choice) with emacs as my text editor for almost all my development, but any sort of keyboard-driven environment that provides an efficient mechanism to switch between different applications and window layouts is at least worth consideration.  I've never missed the 2nd monitor--in many ways it's actually been more convenient and comfortable for me without it. In practice it takes me less time to press a hotkey or whatever than it would for me to physically turn my head to a 2nd monitor.  Anyway I don't know if that's helpful at all.

They sit side by side with a product called Venos Sidecar, which attaches the two.   Duet Display is a multi-monitor solution that doesn't require a wifi network to operate, so all communication is done through the lightning cable, meaning response time is tremendously improved over competitors.

I think apple really screwed up when they opted to use a mobile OS on their tablets. They should of used the regular OS so people could run full programs and not 99 cent apps..  I know at the start tablets weren't powerful enough, but there is no reason that with today's modern tablets, that they could run the full OS. If you could, you could then use any tablet as a wacom with photoshop or illustrator.

A mounted monitor on the side wall (for googleing and browsers) and do your development on a laptop from your bed.  Bonus the monitor would be awesome for movies.

I plan on going to CA this summer, and I will simply just look up the Labor Ready locations, camp out in that city for a few days, and just work as much as I needed. I do have to check the branches and see if that is okay, but if re-applying is necessary, then just make up an address at a vacant house somewhere close by. They might have you go through the hiring process in each state, but they may not. I don't know, but either way, it is great for quick cash at $8-10 an hour. A day's work can fill the tank."

I also have a couple of pocket/small hunting knives nearby... mostly just to make myself feel better. I've also thought about installing locks like this one on the doors out of reach of the windows. It would make me feel better knowing that if someone did break a window while I was inside, it would be difficult for them to get in."
vandwellers,360e9v,neonbible47,4,Fri May 15 02:24:58 2015 UTC,There's not that much of a safety concern.  How often does your car get broken into normally?
vandwellers,360e9v,bestthrowawayeverrr,2,Fri May 15 11:34:45 2015 UTC,But usually I'm not sleeping in my car. It's a little different when you live in your van.
vandwellers,360e9v,bestthrowawayeverrr,2,Fri May 15 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Understood. My point is if you're stealthy, the rate of someone breaking in with you in the van is equal to the rate with you not in the van - which is very small (dependent on where you're parked of course). If you aren't stealthy, I'm not sure whether it would increase or decrease, but I'm prone to thinking decrease the rate because I think criminals breaking into vehicles are looking for easy theft with little chance of confrontation with owners or police.  I personally have had a few instances of people breaking into my car, but that was when I lived in a cheap apartment in a bad neighborhood. In my van I wouldn't park/live there, so I think I and my things are safer."
vandwellers,360e9v,kenbw2,4,Fri May 15 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"This might be an unpopular statement, but why might being female make any safety difference to van dwelling?  I know I couldn't handle myself in a fight and I'm male"
vandwellers,360e9v,Persona_Transplant,21,Fri May 15 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"Lady dweller here, and I think that you make a good point that men need to look out for their safety as much as women do. There are plenty of statistics that indicate that men are actually more likely to be violently attacked by strangers than women are. (Intimate partner violence is, of course, a different story.)   I feel maybe more likely to attract attention when I am traveling alone than a man might, but 9 months in, safety has not once been a problem. Everyone in this lifestyle needs good sense, discretion, and situational awareness, imho.   My big concession to security is that I spent 8k on a decent looking but nondescript minivan that fits right in anywhere, so my stealth game is strong. To LEOs, security guards, border patrol types, and whomever else, I register as a soccer mom, which might even give me an advantage over guys in some cases. I notice when somebody notices me, and frankly, most people don't.   To sleep I prefer nice quiet neighborhoods in the city, and I like to be where someone will hear me if I tap out an S.O.S on the horn. While I'm enjoying the fact that my comfort zone is expanding in general, spidey-sense will always have the final word.   A small truck stop has a cluster of military-age males hanging around out front, watching everyone pull in? Park elsewhere. Sleeping at a rest area for the night? Pull into one to brush teeth, walk around, etc., and then drive down to the next one and go to sleep mode without getting out of the car. Kicking back at the marina for an afternoon? No need to park next to the dude with prison tattoos, or to hang around for any length of time if he parks next to you. If you think someone might be checking you out, or seems curious about what you're doing just sitting in your van, then pull out your phone to look like you are texting; You'll know soon enough if they're scoping you, and if they are, then adios. If someone behaves weirdly, taking a picture of them and/or their license plate is a good defensive measure, but being ready and able to nope out of a situation is an advantage of the lifestyle, right?   I sleep with my keys and cell phone nearby, have a spare ignition key hidden up front as a backup, and park so that I can pull out easily and evade. Beyond that, no weapon in the van, because I'm not going to be fighting anyone.   TL; DR - Dwelling is safe and fun! Most people are cool, but go ahead and be just a little bit paranoid until you get used to it.  :)"
vandwellers,360e9v,Jailbreaktonight,1 point,Fri May 15 06:28:55 2015 UTC,Do you have a blog or anything? Fellow lady about to van dwell interested in other women's experience
vandwellers,360e9v,Persona_Transplant,1 point,Sun May 31 21:06:07 2015 UTC,"Nope, no blog, but feel free to ask away - I love to give advice! I live in a mini-van, so that I can park on residential streets inconspicuously. What kind of van do you have? Are you urban-based or touring around? Honestly, I was a little stressed out when I first got into the van, but I was also excited, and I am embracing it.  Ask anything you like, but my first piece of advice to anyone going in would be:  1) Think carefully about who you tell that you're living in a van. People will judge, or share the information indiscriminately, and you don't need that. This currently inactive blog about homelessness was really comforting to me when I started, especially the part about lying as a survival skill.. I tell people that I am couch-surfing at a friends, which at this point is nominally true (ok, so I'm parking in his driveway at night and sleeping in my van instead of on his couch) and I tell them that my van is set up with a bed in the back because I just got back from a trip to the desert and have another one planned. Which is true, I've taken some very cool road trips! My windows are tinted, but not totally blacked out, so I have a dark brown blanket that covers everything, and to the casual person glancing into the window, the van just looks dark and empty. A passenger, however, could probably surmise what I'm up to. So if I give someone a ride, I provide them with a cover story for their own comfort, and then let them think what they want.   2) Have deflectors on your windows so that you can keep the windows cracked open without anyone noticing. It's great to keep the air inside fresh, especially when it rains.  You will figure it out as you go. If you don't have a regular place to park at night for sleeping, you will also figure that out; trust your gut and you will be safe. And I'm happy to answer your questions!"
vandwellers,360e9v,Jailbreaktonight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:28:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I'm going to check out the links, they sound interesting.

I'm planning on trying to find out if there's communities or meet up places, that kind of thing. I will have my dog with me as well. I lived on a boat for a couple of years and learnt when to be honest and when to embroider the truth, that's a really good point. Especially when I was down a track in the middle of nowhere all alone."

vandwellers,360e9v,AesirAnatman,1 point,Fri May 15 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll explain this to you, because there are similar statistics in America.  Men are more likely to have been attacked than women. Most of those attacks are due to drug and gang activity and drug and gang conflicts. When you exclude those attacks, and only look at random attacks not rooted in drug and gang activities, women are more likely to be attacked.  So between a random man and a random woman, both without drug or gang affiliations, the random woman is more likely to be randomly attacked."
vandwellers,360e9v,Tomgibo,7,Fri May 15 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Please provide some calibrated statistics which show this, right now you just seem to be stating opinion as fact."
vandwellers,360e9v,AesirAnatman,-3,Fri May 15 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of simple logic.  Assailants choose targets that are weak and easy to steal from. Women are way more likely to be perceived as weak and easy to steal from by criminals. If you don't realize this, you haven't spent enough time around criminals to understand them. Criminals are generally sexist. Women are viewed in our culture as weaker and easier to take advantage of, especially by lower classes - and most criminals are from lower classes.  You shouldn't refuse to believe something without statistics or proof. If fact, I know you believe plenty of things without evidence."

vandwellers,360e9v,Glibhat,6,Sat May 23 21:16:32 2015 UTC,Even taking into account all those factors you can't just automatically assume women are more likely to be attacked. Unless I see some proper statistics I just can't agree with you.
vandwellers,360e9v,Persona_Transplant,5,Fri May 15 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think that anyone's taken any offense, but your comment reminds me of something that I wanted to add that I learned in the martial arts self-defense world a few years back. The single biggest risk factor for being attacked is how fatigued you are. Apparently, when looking for victims, this is something that victimizers, either consciously or unconsciously, strongly hone in on. Being a woman, being in a sketchy area, being old - these things are all less of a factor than being aware and alert. I truly believe this.   My comment history is filled with encouragement and advice for women who dwell, based on months of experience doing this in cities on both coasts, national parks, truck stops, rest areas, Indian reservations, big lot parking lots, parking garages, marinas, desert towns, and so on, always with safety as my biggest concern. Building up my confidence has been one of the best parts of the experience, but I would say that if you're convinced that you're ""prone to be attacked"" for any reason, than living in a van might not be for you."
vandwellers,360e9v,A-Grey-World,2,Fri May 15 09:08:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think hour more likely to get attacked if you are male. Statistically, men are victims of violence more and Ive experienced potentially violent confrontations many, many times more than female friends I knew in the same area.  But you are more likely to face sexual assault as a girl, so there's that."
vandwellers,360e9v,boatrightp,1 point,Fri May 15 15:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'm about to take off to drive all over, I'm female, and I'm not going to let fear of safety deter me from traveling.  Keeping yourself aware, trusting your gut instincts, being smart about your surroundings and where you park, and keeping a few things handy, just in case, to deter someone is what I'll be doing.  Keys with piercing alarm, knife, foghorn, bugspray, dog and unloaded handgun will be nearby (overkill, I know lol).  Mostly, that is so my family won't be overly worried about me and will help me sleep good at night.  Most thieves want a quick steal, not someone raising a ruckus.  Keep your items out of easy sight so they can't see what you have in there they might want to steal.  Rapists want someone alone they can take easy, so don't put yourself in that situation if you're worried everyone is a rapist out there, go where there are other people around.  Put some really big boots out your door and put out two chairs instead of one to make them think there's a big dude inside, if you decide to sleep out in the woods.  Hmmm...  I wonder if they sell a remote alarm to sound like a huge raging pitbull?  :)  Life is too short to be afraid of everything out there.  If I wind up being wrong, at least I tried to live out there instead of in a cage  and will die happy."

I'm working to get into a trade, and though it would be incredible to live and travel in a van, coming home sweaty and dusty seems like a good way to get the place very dirty very quickly. And then, having to drive somewhere else to shower, take a dump, and wash my work clothes.   I guess it's not a deal breaker necessarily, it's just a lot more work."
vandwellers,35ylwj,Arrivaderchie,5,Thu May 14 22:06:50 2015 UTC,I work in the trades in Hawaii and it's hot year round and I get sweaty and dirty everyday and I don't consider my van dirty on the inside. I just take off my shoes and shirt and stuff them into a hanging clothes hamper. The cloth hamper is suspended and doesn't sit on the floor so air can circulate through the dirty laundry preventing issues with odor and what not. Dry dirty laundry is better than wet dirty laundry since laundry days are on Saturday only for me. Everyday that I work I also go to the gym to work out and shower. So I really don't spend anytime in the van before that happens. If your habit is to get dirty at work and then go lay around in your van before showering then it would be dirty.

vandwellers,35w3lc,cormsonthebayou,2,Thu May 14 00:16:02 2015 UTC,"This looks moldy.  Make sure that you have excellent ventilation before you go any further.  Ventilation is your single most important requirement because of the moisture that you make in the van at night.  Your goal is to minimize how much you wet the contents at night, and you want to hasten the 'drying out' during the day.  Step two is to reduce existing mold (or encapsulate it in paint).  Wash the curtains in bleach.  Spray all that wood with bleach, let it sit, rinse and dry thoroughly, then seal it with two coats of polyurethane paint (inside and outside surfaces, top and bottom).  You might let it dry for a day or two parked in the sun in dry weather.  You might use a sprayer for the hard to reach spots.  If you reduce the exposed unfinished wood surfaces, you will reduce mold growth.  If anything is really moldy, tear it out and replace.  If anything develops mold, tear it out and replace it with a different material.  A conventional sofa may get moldy and it will hold moisture and release it slowly during the day (like a big sponge).  That will keep the humidity high during the day when you're not in the van and when you want the van to be drying out.  Likewise, anything that will absorb moisture (like cotton clothes) should be kept in sealed plastic bags or boxes (to avoid the sponge effect).  Use bed/sofa components that will dry out easily during the day and that you can easily disassemble and put out in the sun to dry and air periodically.  Thermorests are ideal.  And periodically run things like curtains and blankets thru washing washing machine with bleach and/or hang in the sun.   The natural cycle for vans is that they get wet at night and dry out during the day.  You want them to dry out as quickly as possible (and as throughly as possible) during the day to reduce mold growth.   If you're in a temperate or tropical climate, managing moisture and mold will be more challenging.  If you're in a drought area, mold should not be a problem.  Mold will eat/grow on cotton and wool fibers, and unfinished wood.  But mold will not grow so well on synthetics and clean metal.  Choose materials with this in mind.  From a mold growing perspective, cotton futons can be unhealthy in a van."
vandwellers,35w3lc,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Thu May 14 12:49:56 2015 UTC,Great post. I use vinegar instead of bleach. I spent a lot of time on this aspect and went with a basic setup - bed frame and cubbies. Good luck.
vandwellers,35w3lc,0nth3r04d,1 point,Thu May 14 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of putting a sofa bed in opposite the hobs/grill to make a sofa during the day and a snazzy double bed for sleeping in.  Because I'm 6'2 it means the bed would have to cover some of the sliding door on the side of the van.  I'm not too bothered about the L shape sofa that's in at the minute, it can stay or go, I'm pretty easy.

vandwellers,35w3lc,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Thu May 14 00:45:12 2015 UTC,http://www.hennessyhammock.com/ Set it up outside when the weather and location are agreeable.  This will give the van an extra day to dry out because you will not be sleeping in it that night.
vandwellers,35wzkq,DORTx2,3,Thu May 14 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"Youll need some way to use the bathroom, maybe a bucket and luggable loo seat for it.  Or a cartridge style portipotti.  Either way, sometimes you cant wait to use a public restroom :D  Tight spaces kind of demand organization, so some containers for clothes and food is probably good idea too.  For electric, id suggest a deep cycle battery and inverter.  Youll need a way to charge it, id go with a solar panel kit.  100 ah battery and 100 watt panel run you about 300 or so, another 20 for the inverter, and 30 for wires and outlets.  But if that is too much, maybe a jump pack, youll need to plug it in to charge it somewhere.  Maybe you can slow charge it thru the ciggy plug while driving, some do that."

Much more efficient tho.   undercharging leads to battery fail so you want 1 watt=1 ah min, but more is better if you have high demands like fridge.  800 watts inverter should be ok, my coibra is limping only after 2 years tho, think fan is dying."

vandwellers,35wzkq,Living_4_Me,2,Fri May 15 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"you can do it, but your battery lifespan will probably be shortened, as it will be undercharged.  matbe if you combine it with alternator charging, for bulk, and the 100 watt top it off.  also get a timer for like 10 bucks on amazon (so maybe 15 canada), so you force the fridge to run at set times instead of often as those fridge tend to do.  you only need it to run enough to keep food cold"

However, as /u/DazarGaidin said, there probably is no power there until a door is opened.  In my van, I can turn the headlight switch which will send power to all the lights and there is a switch on each light so I can manually turn them on.   As to the 2nd question, yes, you can just hook up a cig lighter plug (12v plug) and run the wire to a 12v port and run it that way.  Most of those 12v ports are run on a 15-25 amp circuit so they won't have any problems supplying the power."

vandwellers,35ve7i,acid_clown,0,Wed May 13 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on your upfront budget, time and technical aptitude. LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) are newer and more in use in the Marine and electric vehicle realms, and are superior to standard lead acid batteries in pretty much every way . However, they cost a fair bit more, are somewhat ""experimental"" (although completely safe) so you'll have to piece together your own system. But they are more cost effective in the long run, and even if they weren't, their benefits are well worth the cost. I've been researching them for the past week or so and am almost ready to order my kit. Here's a great starting point: www.technomadia.com/lithium/  If you want to go standard batteries, AGM are the best for sure, and Lifeline are the gold standard - definitely worth paying for. Flooded batteries are much cheaper, but if you plan to have them inside, you'll need a sealed, vented compartment and they also require more maintenance."
vandwellers,35ve7i,nixsee,-2,Thu May 14 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"Read the article. Lead acid batteries are the same technology whether sealed, gel, or flooded. It basically tells you that anything beyond that is marketing (aside from venting flooded batteries).  As for lithium batteries, they are good, but fucking expensive, 100ah for £600! For £600 I'd buy 500w of solar panels a MPPT charge controller, and still have money left for 300ah of batteries! And also they are prone to exploding or catching on fire if you don't know what you are doing."
vandwellers,35ve7i,nixsee,1 point,Thu May 14 07:17:10 2015 UTC,"None of that is accurate at all. Please get your facts straight when posting information that might affect people's spending decisions and safety.   I'm about to buy a 12v 224Ah lithium bank for about $1000 USD. Adding in a few other things necessary to monitor it, it'll be about 1300. You would have to buy ~450Ah of lead acid to get the equivalent usable capacity. In fact, you probably need 20-30% more capacity than that because lead acid batteries don't deliver their stated capacity under real world usage because of Peukarts law.   Ignoring Peukarts law (which is foolish), with lifelines, the best price i can find would be $1200, so it's actually more expensive. Cheap flooded ones from Walmart would be far cheaper, but you have to deal with the venting and maintenance issues.   Because of lithium's ability to accept extremely high charge rates all the way to full capacity (lead only charges quickly to aboit 80%) i plan to charge them exclusively off my alternator, so I don't need solar panels and associated equipment, saving me $500-1000.   Some lithium technologies are unstable, but LiFePO4 are quite safe and are not associated at all with the troubles we've heard about with Boeing etc...   But sure, keep living in the stone age and enjoy carrying around 300lbs of dead weight, plus solar, etc..."

I assume there to be a preexisting solar charge controller, that's a must.  As for what you can run off it - that's a simple numbers game. My LCD monitor pulls at 40W, not sure about fridges. A 100W panel will give you 100W at perfect circumstances, but expect about 20% of that if it's overcast."
vandwellers,35rum0,kenbw2,1 point,Wed May 13 00:18:03 2015 UTC,"What kenbw2 says about the wires but you also need to know how many amps the charge controller is good for.   I'd suggest also ""really"" looking over any of the existing set up you end up keeping to make sure it looks like a decent install. You don't want bare wires arcing and stuff like that.   As for what a ""panel with run"". The panel doesn't really run anything, the panel sends energy to a charge controller which charges a battery. You really need to work in reverse with this stuff.   Figure out how much energy you need, then how much battery power do you need to power that, then how much solar will be needed to keep the batteries recharged (charge controller size varies by how much solar you end up with).   A small fridge really needs to be a 12v one. They will cost you around $500-800 on average and will pull roughly 4-4.5amps. A small 12v LED tv will pull around 2-3 amps depending if you also run an amplified antenna or not.   In my experience if you intend to run a 12v fridge 24/7 off solar alone, you will usually want around 200ah of battery storage & at least 200 watts of solar. This of course matters a bit as to where you are in relation to how much sun do you get. If you don't get good sun year round you will likely need more solar but 200w is a good starting point while 300 is better (more is always better)"
vandwellers,35rum0,crockett5,1 point,Wed May 13 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"ok, so here is basically from my experience, i'm sure there are other correct answers to your questions as well, i only know what i have found to be true.   so here's the deal, there are two ways of hooking up solar panels together, either parallel(separately going to the same battery source) or series(in a line).  only the latter will cause you any problems, and only even then if you go over 15w on 12v panels, anything over 15w you want to make sure you have an adequate charge controller.  anything under 15w you can simply put a blocking diode on your positive wire, i usually put it right out of the alligator clip. right now i have two 5w panels run together, total of 10w and then i have another 10w panel running separate, just clipped in to the i battery at the same time.   i need to get at least 10w more than i have to be able to really handle my power usage(i work online quite a bit and also spin music, dj mixes and what not, so i almost always have at least a laptop and phone needing power). with 30w, you could under ideal sun conditions charge a regular size car batter in several hours, 4-5 or so, with only 20w right now it takes over a day, crazy how just 10w extra makes that huge a diff.  so yeah, to answer that other part of your question, you probably want at least 20-30w of total panel output, but ideally if you can afford it, for your desires, i would really recommend at least 30, if not 40.     which brings me to another aspect, i always work with 12v panels and hook them up to a deep cycle rechargeable battery, right now i have a couple motorcycle batteries i rotate into being charged/use.  which if you do it that way of course you will need an inverter also, if you want to run a tv, stereo, computers, etc, you nee to get an inverter of at least 300w, but i really recommend 500w.  i feel like unless you have a really hefty setup, anything over 500w is really going to either drain your batteries super fast or it's just not going to work properly.      so yeah, that's what i got.  hope some of it helps. cheers man and luck with it for sure."

vandwellers,35r7rc,TheBigBeefy,2,Tue May 12 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"Look for a brand new one.  :)  All kidding aside, all I did in my reply above is google ""1999 GMC Turbo Diesel"" and got that result.    I wouldn't get too hung up on what engine to get.  No engine is truly bulletproof.  It all depends on how it was taken care of by every owner up until you look at it.  Maintenance records are a good start if the seller has them and how far back they go.  If the rest of the vehicle passes your examination, the last step before handing over your money is to spend a few bucks and have it taken to a reputable shop to be looked at by a pro.  Might spend a few bucks, but could save you thousands down the road.  If the owner objects, walk away - quickly.  I don't have any experience with the engines you're talking about - never owned or driven one.  Ford and Chevy build pretty good motors overall, but like anything else, they have to be maintained to last."

It';s also hard for them to deal with due to the fact if they legitimize it more people will want to do it.  The other issue is some people will act responsible while other will abuse the situation.  I've see it even at walmarts, people living in their cars dumping trash on the ground because they don't care.  Then you have some whom will try to beg for money in the parking lots while other hold a job or are self sustained by some means and don't abuse the spot they park in.  There is just no catch all solution and trying to lump it into a catch all will never solve their issue because every person will react differently.

You do not have to be blind to have a service animal, not all disabilities are visible.   There is no government offical registration for a service animal despite a common belief to the contrary.  You are not required to disclose medical information to anyone without a court order.  Some people put marked vests or laminated cards or tags that indicate a service animal, to avoid having to explain/inquires. Or you can just go places were pets are fine.  there are a lot of them."

vandwellers,35pa79,boatrightp,3,Wed May 13 01:59:34 2015 UTC,"No, this guy is full of shit, and you will give service animals a bad name by doing this.  He may be right that there isn't 'an official government registration', but that doesn't mean you can just make shit up.  https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet   A service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability  Emotional support animals, comfort animals, and therapy dogs are not service animals under Title II and Title III of the ADA. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not considered service animals either. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the individual’s disability. It does not matter if a person has a note from a doctor that states that the person has a disability and needs to have the animal for emotional support. A doctor’s letter does not turn an animal into a service animal.  While Emotional Support Animals or Comfort Animals are often used as part of a medical treatment plan as therapy animals, they are not considered service animals under the ADA. These support animals provide companionship, relieve loneliness, and sometimes help with depression, anxiety, and certain phobias, but do not have special training to perform tasks that assist people with disabilities. Even though some states have laws defining therapy animals, these animals are not limited to working with people with disabilities and therefore are not covered by federal laws protecting the use of service animals.   ""Your dog can go anywhere you go if its a service animal.""  Wrong.   If a service animal behaves in an unacceptable way and the person with a disability does not control the animal, a business or other entity does not have to allow the animal onto its premises. Uncontrolled barking, jumping on other people, or running away from the handler are examples of unacceptable behavior for a service animal. A business has the right to deny access to a dog that disrupts their business.   Now will you get away with it?  Probably.  You could also sit in a handicap spot on a bus, or use the mobility scooters at the grocery store too while you're at it."

vandwellers,35lqml,aboyfalling,9,Mon May 11 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"Battery issues:  -What kind of mini fridge are you using? If it's one of the high end Engel type fridges that are super efficient 12v (Which I doubt because you're using an inverter), those things take a lot of juice to run and they run at 110.   -2nd: the 50 AH is not a lot of juice and you're not using any sort of charging device so you're definitely not getting a full charge on it.   -Another option is getting a gennie and charger. They're loud though so you'd need to do it in a public spot and you can't do it in the middle of the night because it'd ruin wherever you were camping. I'd suggest if you really want to have power - you'll need a bigger battery + a method of charging other than via the alternator (Solar, gennie, plug in, etc)  -You need to do a power useage inventory on how much energy / hour your needs are and either get a bigger battery to handle it or get more energy efficient appliances (Or go fridge free and do stuff like pasta, etc and shop more frequently."
vandwellers,35lqml,Bernieslo,2,Mon May 11 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"I second this.  A 50Ah battery is at the smaller end of the scale and you're running two very power hungry devices.  Anything with an electric motor is going to suck power, and a fridge compressor is essentially a motor. Also, the hotter it is, the harder your fridge has to work to keep its contents cool.  At a guess, I'd say your fridge and fan are drawing upwards of 7A. In practice, a 50Ah battery will only give you 25Ah, so you have less than four hours' worth of power for those two devices on a full charge (7A x 4h = 28Ah). Unless you're driving for 3+ hours during the day, your leisure battery won't be getting fully charged.   If you're considering doing this long term, it's vital to do some careful calculations on your daily power needs then figure out how you can a) reduce your needs (like get a more efficient fridge) and b) generate and store at least that much power during the day.  You'll probably realise you need a combination of a much bigger battery (minimum 100Ah), solar, and perhaps some way to plug into the mains.  In my van I have a 100w solar panel, 110Ah battery and a 40w 12v fridge which draws about 3.5A when running. Also use LED lighting in the evening, listen to music and charge iPhones etc. I rarely park up for more than 3-4 days without driving for long enough to completely recharge but have yet to run out of power."

vandwellers,35lqml,kenbw2,1 point,Tue May 12 00:21:02 2015 UTC,"Your first option is exactly how I have mine set up (alternator and solar charger in parallel). I also have a 240v AC mains charger in parallel so I can charge when hooked up.  Definitely don't run the alternator through the solar charger - that's crazy. You'll fry something, probably your van.  Remember that all alternators have over-charge protection built in, as do solar chargers. AFAIK that means they simply stop pushing charge when a certain voltage is reached in the battery. They will work quite happily together."

vandwellers,35lqml,Dlichterman,2,Wed May 13 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this. When using solely your vehicle alternator to charge your battery, it will take 3-4 hours of driving to re-charge it to 100%. You can get up to 80% in less than an hour, but that last 20%, which in this case you need, takes the longest.   Taking your battery below 50% will shorten its lifespan considerably.

vandwellers,35lqml,BobbyBoulder,5,Mon May 11 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I lived in Louisville Ky for 20+ years and can possibly shed some insight where to park. I would recommend parking in the highlands. Upper middle class area, low crime, all street parking. I used to live at 1019 everett ave. Theres parking in the rear of the apartment complex. If you park after dark and rise early in the morning, no one will care. Avoid sleeping in old Louisville, West Louisville/dixie highway (high crime). Highlands in general is a safe bet. Large apartments, retirement homes and church parking lots should Kosher. You never want to sleep in the same spot each night, move around so you have enough unique places to rest for each day of the week.   If you don't have black out curtains I would invest some money into those. I purchased vinyl at hobby lobby. It is expensive but worth the privacy.   Ditch the fridge, I have a 210AH setup and have yet to make the math work on a mini fridge running off an inverter.   Also one of my favorite parks to hang out is called Cherokee park.

vandwellers,35lqml,Mikedownbytheriver,5,Mon May 11 21:25:38 2015 UTC,"Your electrical system is a joke, you can't run those devices off one small battery and an engine inverter. If it was that cheap/easy every SUV would have a fulltime minifridge as a manufacturer option.  Throw away the 110v fan that you're running off the inverter, that's a joke. Find a 12v airflow fan, or do a roof vent install on a 12v vent fan. The fan can run off the 55AH battery, and maybe a few 12v lights, and that's it if all you're going to do is charge while driving.   ---You can't frequently discharge a deep cell battery more than 50% or you will kill it, so your 55AH are actually 27AH, and 27 AH at 12v is 324 Watt hours. This means that you can run a device that is 300 watts for one hour (24 watt or so go to inverter loss for your 110v inverter). Or a 150 watt device for 2 hours. Now, go look at the back of your mini fridge. How many watts is it? Fridges have something called a duty cycle (they're not always on), for a mini fridge assume perhaps 35%. So multiply the wattage of the fridge by 24, then multiply that by .35. Divide that number by 12. That is how many AH of battery you need to run ONLY the mini fridge, for one day, from a full charge. But since you can't run the battery down more than 50%, you need double that... ---*  *fridges are tricky and you should usually install them only if you plan of having excess battery. The draw changes depending on the outside temp, the amount of food in there, what setting it's on, how often you're opening it... go shopping, open the fridge for 5 minutes and put a bunch of luke-warm grocery store food in it, and suddenly it's got to run for an hour to get to temp and that draws an extra 4ah that day and if your battery is only 27.5 ah, you can see how that kind of game would just never work...  Go for a 4 hour drive to properly charge it up, then don't let it die. Realize that if you've been killing the battery to dead for several days, it may already be toast, or have diminished capacity. Use it for those two 12v things (fan + lights) and keep your inverter (but NOT plugged in as it is a phantom draw) for the occasional 110v use like a laptop charge or your girl's hair dryer or something.

vandwellers,35lqml,LosingLatelyGambler,3,Mon May 11 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"""mini fridge off the inverter"" is the reason the battery keeps dying..  Also as others have said 50AH is nothing. If you want to keep even a 12v fridge going 24/7 you should have close to 200AH of batteries.  You are best to forget about the fridge for now and transition into foods which don't need to be refrigerated until you get things sorted out.  Anyway, not properly preparing your van for 24/7 living is the reason many people fail at this lifestyle and leave it hating it.  I'd suggest making yourself comfortable and worrying about the basic til you get things sorted out and figure out what works for you. The fridge isn't going to work with what you are doing so unless you are prepared to spend a lot of money, then shelf that idea for now and eat stuff that doesn't need refrigerated.  As for your location.. Every place is different, so you will have to hunt for good spots to over night. Once you find them, don't burn them out by abusing them.   You could also try to fin d some local truck stops to substitute for walmart."
vandwellers,35lqml,crockett5,1 point,Mon May 11 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"""mini fridge off the inverter"" is the reason the battery keeps dying..   It's the battery size and quantity, and availability of power. Most boat fridges run off a deep cycle battery and inverter."
vandwellers,35lqml,robshookphoto,1 point,Tue May 12 09:40:31 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a boat fridge that was not a purpose built 12v. Yes they can have the option for 110 while on shore power but they run 12v while on battery. In fact my last van the fridge was from a sailboat and it was a 12v/110 Norcold.  They are designed to be much, much more efficient on 12v than a cheap mini fridge. Hence the reason they cost $500-800 dollars."
vandwellers,35lqml,crockett5,1 point,Tue May 12 12:47:28 2015 UTC,"If it's a 12v compressor fridge then it does not need an inverter to be powered. It can run directly from a 12v battery bank.  If it needs an inverter to operate on 12v then it's not 12v.  Mini fridges are different from 12v compressor fridges.. The term mini fridge typically means those cheap college dorm fridges which you can buy at Walmart or many other big box stores for $100-$150 on average.  They are built cheap hence the price and are not efficient. They will also require an inverter and are very hard to keep running long term on 12v power. If it was easy to run cheap mini fridges in vans then we would see a lot of people doing it. It's not, hence the reason people spend the money to buy 12v compressor fridges.  A 12v fridge will cost anywhere from around $500 to $1k (mine was $640). The reason they cost more is they use better parts and are very efficient and can run directly off a 12v power supply.   Typical college dorm mini fringe will pull around 8amps while running and can pull more when the compressor first turns on + what ever the inverter pulls.   A typical 12v compressor fridge will pull around 4amps while running with no noticeable spikes at compressor start up."

STILL damaged my batteries tho.   solar is great at topping off batteries, grab a 100 watt kit and a fresh 100 ah battery and you shouild make it.  also, get a timer for your fridge so it only runs when you want (min possible to keep food safe temps).  they are cheap..at night when its cool i would only let it run every 2-3 hours or something for 30mins."
vandwellers,35lqml,DazarGaidin,3,Tue May 12 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"I tried sticking with alternator charging and was having reasonable success. But I did end up slowly depleting my battery, and it wasn't sustainable.  It's a simple numbers game and your alternator's input (in Ah) per day needs to be equal or greater than your usage. In my case I think it charged at 2.5A, so over 2 hours that's 5Ah. My output was about 15Ah per day, so you can see how that went.  I tried to avoid going solar, not least because in the UK the gains aren't that impressive. But I ended up seeing it as inevitable and found that I get 10Ah from my 100W panel on the worst overcast day, so it's actually enough to keep me going.  My only other advice would be to avoid using an inverter as they are inefficient. Consider a 12V fridge. You might want to also consider a larger battery, although I know that might be budget restricted. At 50% discharge you have 25Ah capacity there, which isn't a huge amount."

vandwellers,35nj6q,Bernieslo,2,Mon May 11 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"You mean insuring the stuff in the van, yes? If that's the case you may want to check first to be sure your renter's insurance will cover it. Considering the van is not a ""sticks & bricks"" and you're not renting it (yes?) the renter's insurance may not work, in which case the address won't matter. And even if they let you keep the insurance you'd be paying for basically nothing; I was able to keep my car insurance after I got rid of the car because I was expecting to get a van soon, but when that didn't happen I cancelled it because I was wasting that money and I was already on a really tight budget. (From the insurance company's POV it's a win-win situation - they get to collect money when there's nothing to insure, so they'll never have to pay out.)  You could also look into getting RV insurance, since that's basically what your van will be - an RV. I don't really know much about it but I would guess it's designed to cover both the vehicle and its contents. I've heard it's pretty cheap too but others here who actually have it can talk about that. Maybe they can also address - or you can check - whether the vehicle needs to be registered as an RV. That might depend on the state you're located in."
vandwellers,35nj6q,kimadagem,-1,Tue May 12 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, renters does cover it. Renter's insurance essentially is a policy on all your belongings and its global.

vandwellers,35nj6q,LASuperdome,0,Tue May 12 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"Insurance professional here.    No, renters insurance isn't global.  Renters insurance insures your possessions in the rental, personal liability, med pay, property damage.  If someone broke into your car and stole the possessions then it would be covered under your 'auto comprehensive insurance.'  If you were traveling to Paris and your backpack gets stolen then that would be covered by 'travel insurance.'  I recommend x-posting your questions in /r/insurance"
vandwellers,35nj6q,LASuperdome,0,Tue May 12 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"Literally talked to them yesterday and they confirmed that. If your bike gets stolen downtown etc that's covered, if car broken into it covers that as well. Maybe it varies by company?"
vandwellers,35nj6q,Van-van,1 point,Tue May 12 22:18:17 2015 UTC,"No, sorry. That's not correct. If your car gets broken into that is auto insurance. It's cover under comprehensive coverage in your policy.   If you take something like a laptop with you on a trip which you would normally keep at your rental then it would be covered under renters. However you have to actually rent the apartment and keep stuff there regularly. And with that youd have to pay the deductible if you ever had to put in a claim which would be around $500+ based on your policy.  Edit: and you can't insure something you have no stake in. What you're describing in your original post would be considered insurance fraud. If you have comprehensive coverage on your auto insurance just use that. You wouldn't be committing fraud, the deductible is probably better, and you might already carry it."

You essentially run a hot and ground wire from the main battery to the leisure battery with the solenoid placed in between the two. so it goes your main battery (+/-) > Solenoid > Leisure battery (+/-).  After you run that cable, you just run a wire to any accessory cable that provides 12v to act as a 'turn on' wire, and a ground to the frame.   What this accomplishes is whenever you turn your car on (and the turn on wire gets a 12v signal), the solenoid will close allowing current to flow through it from the main battery to the leisure battery. When the vehicle is turned off, the solenoid opens and current cannot pass through the solenoid, saving your engine battery from being drained by the house battery.  Edit just clicked the top link, and it's a continuous duty solenoid. Oh well, I'll still leave my comment. Good luck!"

A van is workable for me, and a tiny house would be perfect.  speaking of, are there any videos of folks that use both a teardrop and a van? I think it would be a pretty solid way to go, you could use the teardrop for either your bed or storage, leaving a ton of free space in the van to do stuff you normally wouldn't be able to do.  It defeats the stealth part for anyone that is trying to stealth, but Im sure some people could do some pretty sweet stuff with a setup like that!  either way, im amazed at how little she needs to live, that's pretty awesome!"

Swatting is the act of tricking an emergency service (via such means as hoaxing a 9-1-1 dispatcher) into dispatching an emergency response based on the false report of an ongoing critical incident. Episodes range from large to small — from the deployment of bomb squads, SWAT units and other police units and the concurrent evacuations of schools and businesses, to a single fabricated police report meant to discredit an individual as a prank or personal vendetta. While it is a misdemeanor or a felony in the U.S. in and of itself to report any untruth to law enforcement, swatting can cause massive disruption to the civil order and the public peace by the hoaxed deployment of police and other civic resources such as ambulances and fire departments. The term derives from SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics), a highly specialized type of police unit ."

vandwellers,35ibd2,cliffdweller67,1 point,Sun May 10 23:20:34 2015 UTC,I've done it in both a Subaru outback and a Toyota 4x4. I pretty much set up a bed in the back and then carried camping equipment and traveled very light with clothing. Toilets are everywhere. The use of cafes for internet and electrical. In cities I would situate myself near a bar so I had access to toilet at 2 am if need be. I felt like people aren't really paying notice to a truck or SUV. You can tint your windows. Probably run you a few hundred dollars. The pros do a good job. With that and some curtains you will be stealth. Camp grounds and BLM you don't need to worry. Also with rest stops you can sleep and cook if you have camp stove. Those are really good and you don't need to be stealth. It's much cozier in a small suv and 4x4 and you have to be a bit more organized.

vandwellers,35i6wd,gergek,3,Sun May 10 16:54:04 2015 UTC,Don't forget the motorcycle/motorCross crowd. Some access lifts are great for lifting sports bikes and crosser into van for track days etc.  Will depend on the design of the lift as to whether it will actually do it but lots do. Sports bikes tend to be around 200kg most lifts I've seen are rated to 300kg. So it tends to be more about will the bike fit on neatly.

vandwellers,35i6wd,BigMatteson,2,Tue May 12 13:42:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did. The lift still worked - the seller demonstrated it before I bought the van - but it was taking up space in the back that I wanted to use. I tried calling a local van conversion place (I was in Denver at the time) and they said they could remove it but the charge was more than I could afford, so I tried putting an ad on Craigslist. I tried to make it clear in the ad that the buyer would have to remove the lift and that's exactly what happened - a couple of guys came down from Boulder with a pickup and spent 2 or 3 hours taking it out, in pieces. And I made about $200, I think; I can't remember exactly, it was more than 3 years ago. I think they even took the battery; they didn't need it but I was planning to get a new one so they saved me some trouble. And the nice thing about all of this, besides bringing the cost of the van down a bit, was the wiring was already there for a house battery, and a place to put it.  I hope that helps. I have no idea if wheelchair lifts are regularly sold like this on Craigslist or if I just lucked out. But at least you know it worked for one person. :)"

vandwellers,35hp8e,stlfreak,2,Sun May 10 20:02:33 2015 UTC,"Browse craigslist for a used one out of an old RV. Look for Free RV's in the free section. Sometimes you can score one there if someone is tearing down an old RV. They do show up. They work well, don't use much propane at all to run the little pilot light. They kill batteries pretty decently with the heating element if they're running on 12v. Have had a number of them. They're pretty decent if they're set up right. You'll need to pay particularly careful attention to how you vent it and let air get to it, will require outside van louvered covers so you don't asphyxiate and die. If you do find a used or free one that isn't working right, flip it upside down and listen to the coils on the back. If you hear a gurgling sound then it still has refridgerant in it. Flip it upside down and leave it that way for a day or two, often this will allow it all to circulate and churn up in there and it will once again work when you flip it over and plug it in. RV fridges are pretty slow, so it normally takes a day to get them down to cooling as they have no compressor to assist the process.   Good luck. :)"

vandwellers,35h8a8,ImReallyHighBut,1 point,Sun May 10 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"For the past few months I was dead set on going hammock; I sleep in one now. but I've recently decided to make my desktop two pieces of 1/2""x17""x6' connected by hinges of the front side of the desk. So at night, just open it up like a horizontal door with supports; I'm a sleeping pad/sleeping bag guy so I'm not worrying about cushions.   Another option I'm considering is scratching my hard wood floor plan and go with http://www.bedrug.com/products/cargo-van-mats.html. That way the whole floor is sleep space, 1-2 people can sleep on the folded out desk. and a hammock is never in the way if you set it up last.   I guess my advice is to build it with some kind sleeping platform for those too slammed to set up the hammock, face plant into the cushion nights. Plus sex is a lot more manageable on a stable surface."

Which is why most people with old cars that get A/C probs just don't fix them. A recharge costs $100. You could do it yourself, it's real easy, a $50 aerosol can into a hole - but you have to know where to look. When you get it inspected you have them charge it and make sure it's working. Try getting the seller to take it out of the price. It does say OBO, when you lowball him that's the kind of reasons you give.  Edit: just saw that you are skipping it so nevermind."

You have lots of space, quiet, free internet, access to databases for research. Perhaps most importantly, you have no compulsion to buy coffee/snacks to extend your welcome like you do at aa coffee shop. If you go regularly you start to notice the same people and can get to know them too.   Another good idea is many cities have free WiFi in public places like parks and squares. If you're able to just sit with your laptop on your lap, it's a great place to work, catch some rays and people watch. Or use your phone as a WiFi hot-spot. Or just get off the Internet for a while and see your productivity skyrocket."

I'm definitely looking for a Hiace or similar size, since I want something bigger than my last van, a Vito, which was about the same as that volkswagen.

vandwellers,35g6c2,warm_n_toasty,2,Sun May 10 19:36:36 2015 UTC,"mine drives like a car. I have the trucker 8 ball on the wheel. Its like using a joy stick when youre driving it.  Its pretty quiet on the road and I have BFG All terrains on it.  On a trip to colorado from florida and back  I averaged about 22mpg there and about 19 back but I was carrying about 2000lbs of gear coming back.  If you keep it maintained itll go for ever. It if breaks and youre not mechanically inclined itll cost.   I put new glow plugs and power packs and my clock spring failed plus a few minor things and it was about 3000 dollars for 1000 buck in parts. I could have done it my self but didnt have a place to do it or gear to do it at the time.     Mine is at 230k-ish miles.   I was looking at a new one but they are 75 grand So Ill just keep updating and replacing parts for ever. I do over maintain mine.  Mine had a rough life as a cargo van before I got it.  Right now Im in my 3rd deconversion conversion.  When I got it I lined it with plywood and built the bed platform in a boat yard with pretty much a skilsaw and a drill.  took that out and did another conversion.   took most of that out and Im on my third iteration.  and there will be a fourth at sometime. making everything modular has made a difference.  major difference in the ford and sprinter is space. I have the extended length sprinter . I have 14 feet in the back versus about 9-10 in the ford and the sprinter is wider and more head room,, if youre tall it makes a difference."

Might as well buy an RV) but I think I'm pretty much set on a Sprinter now.  Gonna try and find an older one in good shape if I can.  Now I see why it's the holy grail."

vandwellers,35ekg4,CapitanHarlcok,4,Sat May 9 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I will chime in on the things I know and what is doable for me. I have wifi (jetpack) through Verizon. It costs additional but it is secure. Most everyone on here uses open networks but I'm too leery of my identity being stolen. If you use coffee shops be sure to have a really good security because third parties use that to steal data from you. So if you do any business with money on line be careful. As for work as you suggest. Never having lived in L.A. you are going to struggle with the traffic should you decide to do UBER. Also, UBER requires newer cars. They have a purchasing incentive but it sounds like a nightmare. It is a not so good of a company to get involved with unless you are willing to work many many hours. Your success is based on customer reviews and you have to hustle and deal with a lot of BS. Thousands of people who have worked for UBER hate it. But the good thing about L.A. is they passed a law that makes it legal to sleep in your car/van/RV and that cannot be beat. So if you find a job, like delivery, you can stick around in one spot. I don't have electricity, nor do I have a sink to wash up in. It's primitive and I like it that way. Maybe start out primitive and see what you need as you go. But of course an RV might be just the thing you are looking for."

Be sure to black out windows at night , i used black foam board vecrod up and cut to fit side windows, sunshade in windshield.  Use an empty kitty litter bottle with a half cap of laundry detergent for peeing, wide mouth and some are opaque.

vandwellers,35e8y8,PBandJammm,1 point,Sat May 9 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"So I ended up not going through with it for a few reasons. The way it was panning out after we checked everything out would have been me signing the title and her essentially loaning me the other $600 with the terms of the payment being that I keep it in her garage and let her work on it with me until it's paid off. We would also have signed a contract saying that if I feel like I didn't want it before thirty days are up, she would have bought it from me for what I had paid for it."
vandwellers,35e8y8,kimadagem,6,Mon May 11 02:29:57 2015 UTC,"When she came in she shows me videos and photos of various craigslist ads of vans in our area.   This makes me think she has some connection with the sellers of those vans - or maybe she is the seller.   We found a sweet econoline conversion for 1200 with a cracked windshield.   That's a really low price, which says to me   it has really high mileage it's old it has a lot of problems   or all of the above.  If you're really interested in this van I would say, go see it in person but with any used vehicle it's always a good idea to get it checked out by professional mechanic.  The idea of splitting the cost of the van (that's what you meant, right?) with a stranger would make me nervous. And a van that costs that little? And she's going to let you park it in her garage for free? Or is there a charge for that? And why does she want to help you work on it? Of course, if the two of you split the cost then she'd be part owner, which means she'd have some claim to it, and if you were living in it that would be a big problem for you. And speaking of ""part ownership,"" whose name would it be registered in? And who would pay for the insurance?  It sounds like those pictures she showed you were in the store, not at the party, yes? Where is the party going to be held, at the warehouse or somewhere else? I'm asking only because I'm wondering if you've seen the warehouse yet, to see what it's really like, what else is in there, what kind of facilities there are for storage and for working on a vehicle, etc. And one final thing: Are you sure she really owns the warehouse?  That's a lot of questions but that's just my take on this situation. I'm sure there are people out there that are that altruistic (I think that's the right word), but I'm not a naturally suspicious person and this whole thing does make me suspicious."

vandwellers,35e8y8,tomkesler,3,Sat May 9 18:35:44 2015 UTC,this is a weird story. I don't think someone cold calls camping stores looking for vandwellers to scam. just get the thing signed into your name if you buy it.
vandwellers,35e8y8,karmaisdharma,3,Sat May 9 16:22:54 2015 UTC,"Not much else to say besides this. That would be an ODDLY specific and weirdly complex scam, but for sure, always go with your gut.    She offered to split the van and then we would park it in her garage and work on it together. Eventually one of us would pay the other off and own the van outright.   Strangest part of the story. It literally makes zero sense. You're both going to work on the van together, and then what, flip a coin to see who gets it?? If she is really enthusiastic about cultivating the community why doesn't she just loan you 600 bucks so you can buy the van outright? This post is hella confusing."

The deal was if they missed two payments, my father gets the store back and they lose all the money they put into it. I recommended before proceeding he bring this to a lawyer. The lawyer said that there is no way to enforce the ""contract"" and that he would likely get messed over and could possibly lose the store.... and his shirt in the process.  There is a saying ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""   However, a possible counter proposal is to ask her to loan you the rest of the money you need. You could keep it at her property and fix it there, but the van has to be 100% legally in your name. If its not 100% in your name you risk losing all money you put towards the van."

vandwellers,35e8y8,cliffdweller67,2,Sun May 10 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"With it parked in her garage she could easily keep you from accessing the van and your half ownership. You would have to take her to civil court and that does not guarantee anything even if the judge sides for you. It's best to just do this on your own unless, like others are saying, you don't mind being out $600 plus additional costs and time you put into the van. If she wants you to help out with her van club then get involved in other ways that doesn't mean merging your money."

vandwellers,35d57o,AstronautFireman,3,Sat May 9 04:04:18 2015 UTC,Automotive AC is not run by electric but rather the compressor is turned by the engine running. It doesn't do anything but run the blower moter from 12v. Meaning it would be useless to rewrite it.
vandwellers,35d57o,crockett5,2,Sat May 9 04:45:48 2015 UTC,"Technomadia’s adventures with Solar AC suggest it’d be nigh impossible even I could run the compressor with 12v, and certainly not cost efficient:   http://www.technomadia.com/2015/02/the-almost-fantasy-of-solar-powered-rv-air-conditioning/  Having grown up in the area, there’s not a price I wouldn’t pay for reliable AC in the mid Atlantic summer."
vandwellers,35d57o,attaboyBrad,2,Sat May 9 05:48:52 2015 UTC,the compressor on the a/c needs the engine to run.  The 12v to the compressor is the clutch activation.    from living in a sprinter in the keys during the summer it is better to get a roof unit. and generator. or find a place with shore power you can hook up to. I used to have a freestanding a/c unit which was awesome but needed to be vented outside and it needed clean stable power.  I never did the starter capacitor upgrade to make it boost easier.  If you want you can try a DIY swamp cooler.  Large cooler and fan on top.  But you have to spend 3 or 4 bucks a day to refill the ice.  Ive tried that with a 5 gallon bucket.  And it works.  But when you run out of ice at 4 in the morning its miserable.
vandwellers,35btfo,Billgonzo,3,Fri May 8 20:24:18 2015 UTC,You need to figure out how many amps the fridge & the inverter pull together. Most likely 130 watts will not be enough for an AC fridge and an inverter.
vandwellers,35btfo,crockett5,3,Fri May 8 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, so the fridge runs at 115volts AC at 1amp. If I understand correctly, this is 115watts AC. According to this website (http://www.batterystuff.com/kb/tools/ac-to-dc-amperage-conversion-run-through-an-inverter.html), I takes 10.58 Amps DC to convert 115 watts . So I think I need 12v DC @ 10.58 amps (126.96 watts) with an inverter that will take that DC input and convert it to 115 watts AC with an 115watt inverter....Am I right in thinking this?"
vandwellers,35btfo,Onelow,3,Fri May 8 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Not quite,  the calculations are correct but you are missing a few things  Inverters are around 90 percent efficient at best  Any little cloud that passes by dramatically cuts power output on solar panels  Most fridges will not keep food cold overnight  Compressor fridges have a huge startup current and then drop down  Modified sine wave inverters are hard on fridges and will cause them to burn out sooner"
vandwellers,35btfo,crockett5,1 point,Fri May 8 21:49:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm not real great on doing all the math with that kind of stuff but 10amps sounds about right I think those fridges usually pull around 8amp/hr. Meaning it would be a little more with the inverter.   Now to give you a comparison, my old Norcold 12v fridge pulled 4.5 amps. I had 200watts of solar and 220ah. With that it would run ok and I'd usually would not go below 85% on my batteries after a night of running.  If it was really sunny then I'd probably hover in the 90% range depending how charged my batteries were at the end of the day.  Now the problem with an AC mini fridge is you are going to pull more than double what my system pulled. Meaning at best case with the exact solar set up I had, you would likely be 70-60% battery charge by the the time the sun comes up in the morning and that's assuming you have a full charge before the sun went down.   The simple fact is 130 watts isn't enough to keep a set up like that running during the day much less have extra power left over to charge the batteries. You get a day of overcast or rain and you are screwed."

vandwellers,35btfo,lshiva,1 point,Fri May 8 21:54:23 2015 UTC,They likely won't be running constantly (I could be wrong). So figuring out their draw over time will be an important calculation. Having a deep cycle battery to stores power would be an excellent Idea.
vandwellers,35btfo,maverick_ninefingers,3,Fri May 8 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I found this site useful when designing my system: http://www.batterystuff.com/kb/tools/solar-calculator.html"
vandwellers,35btfo,rosinall,3,Fri May 8 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"There is nowhere on this planet where the sun never stops.  Run the solar panel to a battery charge controller, which will charge a battery.  From there you can run a DC powered fridge from the battery or if you don't mind a loss of efficiency, use the inverter and an AC fridge.  You don't run anything directly from your solar panels."
vandwellers,35btfo,rosinall,3,Sat May 9 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"Heating and cooling is almost impossible to run from batteries. If it was me, I would discount any advice that could not point me to a working system I could confirm and match.  This is rough math, but a 100Ah 12V lead-acid marine cell ($100 from Wal-Mart) will have an actual Ah capacity, at a draw of 10A @ 12V, of 63Ah. This is due to Puekert's constant, where drawing a load at faster than the 20-hour rate they are calculated at lowers the actual Ah rating. This means you will draw your battery down to 50% — the max recommended discharge — in about three hours. So you'll need several batteries to run this overnight. Even though it will cycle, for your use it will be on most of the time. You would probably need 2 or 3 x 100W PV panels to charge those during the day and still supply power while charging. So call it five batteries and 12 panels, plus inverter and charge controller and you are $2500 into this and we still have not figured in the 3x or more power you will need to spec for to start the compressor several times a day, or hour.  Spend the $800+ on a good 3-way cooler/freezer from Dometic or Waeco and run it off propane.  Source: I ran LEDs, a fan, a stereo, camera/iPhone/iPod/AAA/AAAA/18V DeWalt battery chargers, an internet radio antenna, a modem, a wireless hub, a laptop and whatever else I am forgetting for 10 weeks off grid on 2 x 100W PV panels and 2 x 100Ah 12V batteries — but ran all heat and cooking and refrigeration off propane, including a 33-liter freezer that went all 10 weeks off a single 30-lb tank."
vandwellers,35btfo,tacticaltaco,1 point,Sat May 9 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"Ok. This was helpful, thanks. I found another site that calculates AH needed depending on DC amps. It says I need  350Ah @ 20hrs. Im not sure what the""@ 20hrs"" means, but I assume that I need enough batteries to add up to 350Ah... I guess its time to search for lightly used batteries and solar panels. I dont want to spend an arm and a leg, but I have been planning to slowly add batteries and solar panels as I go...I would like a LGP mini fridge. My stove and my furnace are propane. it would be nice to use batteries for many things than just one . Do you have any recommendations on particular models?"
vandwellers,35btfo,hightiedye,1 point,Sat May 9 02:41:59 2015 UTC,"The 20 hours is what I was talking about; draw out the juice faster than that and the Ah capacity of the source is actually lower than the rated Ah.   I own two Dometic chest fridge/freezers, it took a couple years of Craigslist hounding to find them. The 33L is a U.S. version of the B533 that I paid $200 for; and the one I just bought is about a 15L I got for $140. More commonly available — sometimes for $50 or less — are the built-in 3-way refrigerators, either the small square ones or the small upright ones, that have been stripped out of a camper/RV."
vandwellers,35btfo,hightiedye,2,Sat May 9 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"Your solar panel and inverter will not be 100% efficient.   Inverters are maybe 80% efficient, sometimes more. It's also hard to get the rated value out of a solar panel. You need MPPT and it helps to aim the panel at the sun. Heat also drops panel efficiency. On top of that ideal conditions rarely exist. You only get 3-5 hours of 'good' sun per day.  Solution: You'll have to get a bigger panel. As a guess I'd say get a 200W panel. Since it's a guess I'd get a second opinion.  On to the inverter. A regular fridge has a motor driving a compressor. It's startup surge current is well beyond the stated 115 watts. Your inverter (and it's power source) must be able to handle that. You might have to get a battery to absorb those surges."

vandwellers,35btfo,rosinall,1 point,Fri May 8 23:27:00 2015 UTC,You would need a charge controller but if you find the nodes you should be able to make it work.
vandwellers,35btfo,tacticaltaco,1 point,Sat May 9 01:12:12 2015 UTC,You could crack open the UPS and charge the battery directly from solar (in theory) using an appropriate charge controller and 24V solar panel. Look for MPPT solar charge controllers for 24v systems. They're readily available.  In practice I'm not sure how the UPS's electronics will respond to having the battery charged in an 'out of band' way. Worst case you have to unhook the battery from the UPS to solar charge it and reattach it to the UPS once its done.
vandwellers,35btfo,rosinall,1 point,Fri May 8 23:51:22 2015 UTC,"yeah, this is a great idea! The thing is, if I had to take the battery out to charge it then I would have to do that ever ~68 mins or so because thats how long the battery last when powering the fridge.(I just got done testing that) I got my USP at goodwill for $15 bucks (they didn't know what it was i guess.) It works perfectly though. But im not afraid to break it open...I have no warranty for it."
vandwellers,35btfo,tacticaltaco,1 point,Sat May 9 00:21:30 2015 UTC,You could build a switch that just disconnects the battery from the UPS and connects it to the charger.
vandwellers,35btfo,DazarGaidin,1 point,Sat May 9 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"but then the battery couldn't power the fridge...this UPS has software that can monitor its stats. Maybe there is a way I can disable the battery charging function so that I could attach the solar panel to the battery, while still having the UPS connected....  Wait! If I could disable the charge function, I could pull the battery out and charge it with the solar panel (with a charge controller) and then, connect the output from the controller back to the UPS."

After a few to several hours I might get an overload alarm beeping softly at quarter-volume; or blinking that decoded to overheating although an IR temp gun showed nothing running hot anywhere; or runtime that behaved as expected for a couple hours, than nosedived. I am not an EE by any stretch … but the deepest specs and research I could find (and the APC units have pretty excellent documentation) certainly made it seem like the added Ah capacity in the source itself should not have caused this.   In the end, after a few weeks of testing failures and trying programming tricks found from documentation, I just moved on to a standard system. However, I was able to repurpose one of them into the rear panel of my 4Runner as a mobile 120V power source, charging it (using the original internal batteries) with an inline pure sine inverter under the driver's seat.  EDIT: Want to make clear I am only one person who used three different UPS units from the same manufacturer, and this deserves further testing."
vandwellers,35btfo,mikeraglass,1 point,Sat May 9 02:39:00 2015 UTC,That is incredibly bazaar behavior. I guess whatever smarts were built/programmed in to the UPS it wasn't capable of handling larger capacity batteries.
vandwellers,35btfo,4AVA4AVA,2,Sat May 9 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"some thing to consider, my dorm fridge would spike to 5 times its 'rating'  on compressor start up briefly(1-2 seconds), go 2 about 3 times it, and then slowly drop down to 10- 20 above its rating.  will inverter even run off panels directly?  it will  shut off when there is insufficient power, which will be whenever compressor starts.  grab a marine battery at walmart for 80 bucks..."
vandwellers,35btfo,DaftBunkVan,1 point,Fri May 8 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"Post the mini fridge model number. You might but probably won't get enough power for 1 amp AC. 130w solar panel is in DC to AC is about 1.8amps. This sounds like it will work, but you are cutting it too close because you won't have optimal conditionals all the time (rain, clouds, solar eclipses, ect) and it is not 100% efficient. A good rule of thumb is 80% efficiency. Also... you need a battery? What happens at night when it presumably goes above 50 degrees and your food spoils?  I would recommend getting a cheap battery, 150 watt panel, and hooking up an isolator to the engine battery to your aux battery."

I would beware of the Westys simply based on the availability and cost of foreign vehicle parts, especially in rural areas where you may only have a single auto parts store available.  Chevy/Ford/Dodge parts are much more readily available IMO.  Temper your eagerness for getting out there and take your time.  Research.  Research.  Research.  There are plenty of articles online about how to shop for a used vehicle and some of the key things to look for.  Google is your friend, use it.  Take plenty of notes.  Write down a list of questions to ask the owner about the vehicle BEFORE you go look at it, so your emotions play a lesser part in your purchase decision  - and don't buy on first meet.  Go home, go through your notes, sleep on it, whatever works for you.  Kelly Blue Book and NADA guides are also good tools when gauging prices.  You should also consider asking the owner for maintenance records, and the seller should be willing to have the vehicle inspected at a reputable auto shop.  This is especially important for a camper.  It might cost you a couple hundred dollars, but might save you thousands if the mechanic discovers a hidden problem.  Finally, I have problems with sellers who are dicks.  I wouldn't even consider his vehicle on that alone.  That he's dropped the price so quickly also tells me he needs to unload this thing asap.  Neither do you any favors as a buyer.  Good luck!"

Dealer screwed up to my benefit, which is a rarity.  Just keep in mind one overall rule:  Dealerships are there to make money.  You will likely pay more for the same vehicle at a dealer than you will from a private party.  That said, they may offer some perks that are valuable to you - warranty, pre-purchase inspection reports, in-house financing (if that's your thing), etc.  Find out when you go.

vandwellers,358ukc,Cayou,1 point,Fri May 8 02:40:07 2015 UTC,"a ""ductless non exhausting portable ac unit"" would probably violate the laws of physics.   Doesn't violate the laws of physics.  Ductless a/c units exist for regular housing, and they're very common in places like Europe because they're easier to retrofit than fully ducted forced-air systems like you commonly see in North America.  However the op needs to be aware that ductless doesn't mean ""no connection with the outside"".  Instead of forcing air out, it forces the coolant in-and-out, requiring no air ventilation to the outside to function.  http://contentinjection.com/features-and-benefits-of-ductless-air-conditioners/  I don't know if they make a small unit suitable for a van.  Maybe if the op shops around for the lowest-wattage, lowest capacity unit, and see if he can find a way to reliably power it, I don't know what kind of electrical system/inverter you would need to handle something like that.  The op might want to be aware that ductless a/c units have the compressor outside and thus make more noise on the outside than the inside.  This is in fact a selling point.  If you're trying to stay ""stealthy"", it might not be what you want.  Although generally speaking the compressor on stuff like this is much better than the plug-in garbage you find with the hoses, so they tend to make less noise both in terms of raw decibels and in terms of having the noise spread over more (and lower) frequencies which makes for a lower perceived noise level more similar to the white noise that you hear on house air conditioning units that sit outside.  P.S.  Many of these units also work in reverse as a heatpump, which means as long as it's not too cold (not below -15 celsius or so) you can get more heat than the electricity you put in.  Something like 500 watts can create 1500 watts of heat or something like that.  It works by using the compressor and coolant system to chill the air outside.  Might be useful in a van for the winter."
vandwellers,358ukc,3redradishes,6,Fri May 8 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well sure, that unit removes the need for a duct... by adding an entire second unit to be attached to the outside of the vehicle (with appropriate pipes acting as a tiny duct as far as the laws of physics are concerned).

There is a homeless epidemic here and the last thing anyone wants is to be labeled that. So for me for my vehicle to be tagged as a homeless van is a no no.

Dumpster diving by car is just more convenient but if I were in a densely populated area I'd park nearby but never drive up to it. The last thing you want is to be suspected for whatever happens in the area and have your license plate connected to it. And they do actually have control atleast in Sweden. When I lived in south of Sweden people dumpster dived in a car shared with different groups,  amongst them a militant left wing group, and the cops stopped them basically every time. Sometimes in another car as well! So be careful if you see any reason to. Here I'd never bother caring in small cities but in bigger ones I would."

I'm not so mechanically inclined, not sure i'd be able to install a pop-top myself on a cargo van. But yea, wouldn't be so stealthy..."
vandwellers,3578xc,MetusBatmanV5,2,Fri May 8 09:19:22 2015 UTC,"$11,000? Trash price. In all honesty that van is worth $6,000 tops. People are getting crazy with the prices they ask for vans. I saw a late 1980's van with 200,000+ miles for $4,000. People are morons, shop around for a better price. Do not spend all your savings, worst idea ever. Also get a bare van, do not get a van with a bunch of shit in it already. You'll instantly regret dealing with how someone else setup the van's layout."
vandwellers,3578xc,nixsee,1 point,Fri May 8 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was thinking this as well. Seems like it might be better to start with an empty cargo van, that I could pay a lot less money for, and learn how to add/build what i need from scratch."

vandwellers,354m0t,omegaken,12,Thu May 7 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"I sleep in a hammock - so far it's pretty great. But the setup you are talking about may not work very well.  The key to sleeping well in a hammock is to lie across it at an angle. That flattens it out. Here's an AMA with a great illustration.   When you lie down at an angle it takes up a fair amount of room. I'd say as much as a bed. So if your van is narrow (with storage on either side) then it may not work very well because you would have a hard time sleeping at a diagonal.  A couple things that make hammock sleeping really comfy: an underquilt is a must in my opinion. There is no insulation under you and it can get a lot colder than sleeping on a bed. The other thing is a sleeping bag instead of blankets. Blankets get all tangled up and hard to manage, whereas with a sleeping bag everything stays in place.  Last note about a hammock - if you sleep with a sleeping bag it can take a while to get out of bed. So if you have to pee at night, be prepared for a little work.  I experimented with a few different sleeping arrangements, and wrote about it here (part one, part two)."

I insulated the floor, plywood, tack strips, foam, and then a nice carpet. On top of that I lay down a sleeping bag, a pillow, and that is my bed. After I can roll up the sleeping bag and be on my way. As you said this leaves a TON of space for other necessities."

The last sentence particular. I'm pretty adamant about not shelling my money out to aggressive people. I know it sounds very California but vibe is essential to me. Honestly finding a reasonably priced van with low mileage in California is hard. I finally found a 1989 Dodge ram van for $2000 and I guarantee many would guffaw at my paying that price. The body is clean, engine strong, the suspension needs work. 35,000 miles. I had spent so much time looking and everything was too much, too many miles, too shoddy. I finally found the one I have and just bought it. I really liked the guy, I loved the van, and I pretty said what the heck. As we were doing the transaction like 4 people called for the van. If anything I would say aim for a lower price then you are willing to spend and then if you aren't going to do the inspection take the van to be serviced after purchase. sometimes you just gotta go for it!

I'm especially interested in this van because of the work already done on it. I don't really have the time or the space to properly wire and insulate a van from scratch. Maybe I'm just lazy haha."
vandwellers,3554p2,myownuniqueusername,3,Thu May 7 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, as someone who's selling my car on CL right now, there are people who seem interested and then get cold feet. I wouldn't want to spend $100 on an inspection either. Typically this is the responsibility of the buyer. Anytime I've bought a car, I've been the one who pays for the pre-purchase inspection."
vandwellers,3554p2,myownuniqueusername,3,Thu May 7 05:49:15 2015 UTC,"You nailed it. The guy's advice was dog shit. Who would drive to you, pay $100, and find problems he most likely already knew about? Then you don't buy it and he is out $3,000. I wonder how much business some people on here have actually conducted."

vandwellers,351yio,regular_traveller,13,Wed May 6 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"the thing about ambulances is that they are used pretty hard.  When they drive, they usually aren't gentle, and when they aren't driving, they are usually sitting in idle all day.  There's a reason they get replaced. Expect maintenance costs to come up. If you buy one make sure you get it cheap."

vandwellers,351yio,skuba,5,Wed May 6 13:20:46 2015 UTC,"There are actually a lot of people doing this.  The trucks usually come with bigger motors and strong alternators (if not generators) and are actually well suited for this purpose.  They're well built too, unlike a lot of shitty RV van conversion companies that use cheap materials. Here's a cool conversion for you to check out.  http://six13metalworks.com/projects/hd-rv/"
vandwellers,351yio,mtbr311,2,Wed May 6 20:39:18 2015 UTC,I love this. Especially those wheels/suspension on an ambulance.
vandwellers,351yio,bestthrowawayeverrr,4,Thu May 7 01:38:15 2015 UTC,"I met someone who did it. He mounted a small motorcycle on the back of it. He said that it took him a while to find the 4x4 one, but he says it makes all the difference."
vandwellers,351yio,medi_ian,4,Wed May 6 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"You don't need to find a 4x4 one though.  4x4 ambulances are rare and expensive, the conversion is fairly cheap.  Literally wrecking yard parts from an F-350: transfer case, front axle, driveshaft.  Buy a pair of leaf spring packs and they sell the brackets online.        You can go and expensive or cheap as you want on the upgrades while you do it.       It isn't a huge undertaking, but it will take a couple of days with some skilled labor.  Plus it is always something that you can do ""later""."
vandwellers,351yio,AniGamor,2,Wed May 6 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"True true. AND to add to what you were saying, you can put an ambulance box on the back of an F-350."
vandwellers,351yio,medi_ian,6,Wed May 6 23:25:39 2015 UTC,"Well met brother!  I have a '88 E350 ambulance.  It has its good and bad sides.  ---The Good---  1) Lots of space! - I have way more space than the average dweller and the extra lockers on the outside are a nice feature.  Most dwellers only dream of being able to entertain their friends inside of their rig, but in an ambulance you can comfortably fit 3-4 people in the back.  2) Some of the initial work is done for you.  My ambulance is already insulated and will be very easy to wire for various electrical applications.  I plan on replacing the insulation soon and doing a complete rebuild, but if I needed to start dwelling NOW I would have my bed, insulation, and some storage already there.  If mine had an inverter I would have access to both 12v and 110 electricity.   2) Easy to park! - Ambulances are the sweet spot between a van and a box truck.    3) Weird stealth - Everyone notices that the ambulance is there, but it doesn't have the same ""pedo-van"" feel/stigma that the an e350 or similar van has..  ---The Bad---  1) They are expensive and difficult to insure.  I currently pay $80 a month (as a commercial truck) and my old insurance company would not even touch it.  Forget about telling them you have to live in it: you will be considered ""a high risk"" and they will not insure you.  I've seen people say that you can get them to insure it as an RV if you follow certain steps, but I don't know if that would be more or less expensive.  2) Its hard to find a auto shop to repair them. I live in San Jose, CA (city of 10 million people) and I've only found a couple of shops willing to even go near it, but this has a lot to do with the fact that it is diesel and an 1988.  Towing is also more expensive than your average van.  3) People will keep telling you its haunted.  This is more annoying than a real grip, but just something to be aware of.  ---The Ugly---  1) Like other users mentioned, ambulances are typically driven hard and are often gutted after being decommissioned.  I bought mine without an inverter, which means I wont have any power going to the back lights/fans until I replace this (expensive) part.    ---Conclusion---  If you find a nice ambulance that runs and has electricity in the back, it could be well worth it."
vandwellers,351yio,ambulancechaser1,4,Wed May 6 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"Mine is registered and insured as an rv, the previous owner did it all before I purchased it so I pay about 30 a month, registration is also very cheap and it came with the inverter and battery charger still installed, still trying to figure out all the electrical though. The junction cabinet is a damn bird's nest."

Basically you are paying for a hostel on wheels, that has the ability to take you to different ski resorts every day, or perhaps you just stay at one for a few days, I'm still unsure. The pricing seems reasonable though. Less than 400 bucks gets you all this:   The All-in Week Package - 7 nights (349€)  What is included? Healthy home-made food (6x dinner- 7x breakfast) All transfers to another spots Pick-up and drop-off at the train station or airport in Bilbao Sheets (pillowcase, bottom sheet and duvet cover) Towels A comfy bed with a down blanket & pillow Use of the kitchen, bathroom and living room Wood stove Coffee and tea all day Outside chill area & rooftop deck Locked surf board storage Drying rack for gear Limited Wifi Entertainment: projector, books, games, guitar,… Media Nomad One Apres-surf at the bus (6 beers included) Camping and parking costs Taxes  I'm sure a lot of people are paying that just for a hostel, but this gets you food, transport, and the thrill of being on the road with other travelers. It sounds like it started out as an idea in that couples head, the idea where when you tell someone they say ""that's crazy enough it just might work"" haha. Really brilliant stuff, trail blazers I say. I hope they thrive and it turns out like a great idea. I wonder how something like this would fair in the United States?"

I do it for the freedom, but my freedom doesn't supersede other people's. I try to look at it as if I lived in this neighborhood, would I want a guy I  don't know in a van parked out side my house.. The answer is usually no.. Hence the reason I try to park in more business related areas like big box stores or parking lots I can blend into and hit the wild when ever the chance arises.

When you hit the button on an elevator, and the elevator hurts someone, sometimes you're responsible, sometimes the owner of the elevator is, and sometimes the manufacturer is. The insurance will be there to provide you with a buffer of money and lawyers to protect you from the people who will say it was your fault.

Thank Jesus the patriot was looking out the window during a commercial break in Fox news ' excellent broadcasting. Omg, it's a pedo van.  Admittedly there is only the van on the road, but there could have been children present! THERE COULD HAVE BEEN CHILDREN PRESENT.  The children could have SEEN the man in a van! He might have been SHIRTLESS! If I had any children, then I might have to explain to my children what nipples are. Then they might ask if THEY should walk around shirtless when it's hot.  Before I know it, I'm a grandmother to two kids called Hashtag and Nike. And my son is working at some god forsaken startup where he walks around in sandles all day. Sandles. Do you want that for your child?!  Won't someone please think of the children?!  Be vigilant, neighbours. Terrorists are lurking within, threatening our very way of life."
vandwellers,34y0s2,DerangedDesperado,10,Tue May 5 19:39:00 2015 UTC,"Alright dude look at it this way, every time you see that van its when there are kids outside. I dont think people are worried about someone seeing a nipple. I think they're worrried about someone taking a child.  Most people are pretty familiar with the vehicles in their neighborhood so you're going to be cautious about people just popping up. Shit dude i dont have kids and i'd be curious as to what someone would be doing just chilling in the neighborhood. Not even for kids, dude could be watching to see whos home and when to rob house or something. Frankly, some dude not from your neighborhood in a ratty looking van hanging out near the neighborhood kids is suspicious as fuck on top of that dude speeds off?"
vandwellers,34y0s2,lbpeep,0,Tue May 5 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"The point I'm trying to make is that the whole situation is probably false. It's probably some curtain twitcher who has massively overreacted to a whole bunch of nothing.  Look at the picture. I don't see any kids. Hell, I don't even see anyone in the drivers seat. The picture is shitty quality, so maybe both are present. Maybe neither. Amazing our Facebook saviour knew the driver was reading a map from that distance when we are struggling to tell if someone is even in the driver's seat, isn't it? How the hell can you tell it's a map? Why not a book, a playboy, instructions for something? Maybe our vigilant Facebook saviour thought saying it was child porn felt it would be unbelievable.  And the driver 'sped off' when someone came out of the house. Really? Did we get wheelspin in that old banger? Did it go roaring off into the night because our brave patriot saved the neighbourhood from a serial killer? Did it maybe just drive off because he figured out where he was and knew where to go now at that moment? If that person was actually concerned, wouldn't they just call the police, why confront someone who is dangerous?  I'd bet the van has only been there once, or maybe even belongs to a neighbour. I'd even bet the whole post is basically faked in order for the poster to get attention (""I just saw this creepy van! Wait... I'll say I saw it twice""). Happens all the time.  I thank the op for sharing, but this is probably just complete bullshit and overreaction from the person who wrote it. It's possibly even a downright lie.  In fact, I hope it's a lie, because if this is how people react to seeing a 'creepy' van around the place, then it's just one more strike against civilised society."
vandwellers,34y0s2,DerangedDesperado,7,Wed May 6 04:37:46 2015 UTC,"Im not sure where you live but again its pretty apparent when something belongs to a neighbor. IME people rarely park in streets or are straight up not allowed after certain times so a nieghbor wouldnt just be leaving this in street. You're making a huge number of assumptions based off a story. Your assumptions are absolutely baseless.   REgarding the picture you have one picture that the person probably tried to take covertly so the pesron wouldnt speed off if they noticed beforehand.   Additionally if it was a neighbor that owned it, why in the hell would they speed off? Again this is the only information given and you have no real basis to determine the whole thing to be bullshit.   I live in a small subdivision of condos, i walk my dog so im out frequently. I know the cars in the area and what most of the folks look like. Im also looking out for weird shit or people that are out of place. Its not ridiculous.   Maybe you dont see the strangeness or are struggling to make it out like its nothing because you're one of those folks that shirks normal ways. But frankly posting up in a van, a shitty looking van mind you, in a residential area is going to send up some flags.   Make of it what you want, but i guarantee you most will find your behavior weird.   Ill part with this:  In my neighborhood where i've lived for 2.5 years, i've never see a vehicle in shitty condition unless it was being worked on in a garage. If i saw this POS hanging outside, twice, when little kids were hanging around i would ask them what they were doing. And if in the event of me walking over there, they sped off well god damn that sounds weird to me and i would let everyone in the neighborhood know."

vandwellers,34zu78,fluxofapathy,2,Wed May 6 14:32:43 2015 UTC,If you need a reliable place to shower definitely invest in a gym. I'm not familiar with Chicago but I've been very happy with my Planet Fitness subscription. Of course that's not going to be helpful unless there's some in the area. If I were you I'd rent out a space big enough to build the van out since you've left on such short notice. You're going to need to do a serious space efficient build if you plan on retaining your pets.
vandwellers,34zu78,cliffdweller67,2,Wed May 6 01:51:16 2015 UTC,We have a work space for the van thankfully in a secure garage.  Needed a storage unit for winter clothes and other stuff to be put of the way and sorted later. Researching gyms is a headache though... Thank you for your reply!

I lived in a car with two cats for quite a few months. I opted to locate myself in a remote area so the cats could roam around. I happened to have cats that were like dogs so that worked for the both of us. But it is known that animals suffer under these types of conditions and they are very tuned into stress, suffering stress themselves. If you have any friends that would take them for just a short while as you and your husband get the van the way you like it and you feel more complete in your process then you can bring them back into the fold. I belong to the Y and it works for me. They open at 5 am and stay open until 10pm. They have a nice sauna, lots of space for working, relaxing and i don't feel overrun by gym monkeys like at 24 hour. They also have a pool and classes and very down to earth people (this is in Oakland). I feel like I can spend hours just hanging out and reading in relaxation. I hope this helps."

I do wedding photography to fund my own pj and documentary work (I'm currently in Palestine). I'm outfitting a Sprinter to live in, and eventually will live between that and a sailboat while continuing to travel as well.  How is it afforable? No rent, no mortgage. Other than the student loans, you're blessed - you see all those people making money at photography who didn't go to school for it? You DID go to school for it. You have such a leg up it's insane.  The people who quit their jobs to travel do odd jobs mostly. Seasonal labor stuff. I have a friend who lives on a 27 foot sailboat off of meager (probably ~$10k) social security. Before that he did housekeeping, carpentry, etc - whatever to stay afloat. I've met people overseas who left with $5k and have been traveling for 5 years. They volunteer at hostels in exchange for breakfast and a room, they get odd jobs across the world, etc.  Break out of your middle-class-college mold. Most of the world doesn't work - there are other ways to get by."

I know I have a skill set that is versatile and I can travel while shooting but to make money is a difference. I dont have a problem looking into seasonal work- like working at resorts, kayaking, etc. The loan thing worries me because I dont want it to fall on my parents too much. Right now I work a photo gig at a very successful company and I make good money. So I think thats also hard to walk away from into the unknown.   That last sentence got to me. Thank you for that. I think thats a hard thing to break out of. You're taught your whole life how to grow up, get a job, work, and save, etc. Its a hard mold to break. Its hard to comprehend. Its hard to believe its possible when so for so long- youve been told it wont.

You are in that stage where you're getting more envious and less inspired. Maybe not majority envious, but perhaps you can see my point? It's like facebook or any other social media man. ""Don't compare your life to others highlight reel"" is a quote that makes a lot of sense to me in this age of social media. robshook already gave you the best advice so I'll just tell you the other side of the equation that doesn't really concern the subject of the matter but more asking why you yourself are experiencing these feelings in the first place? I can appreciate your responsibleness with the loans and everything, but don't use that as a crutch to becoming stagnant. It sounds like you have skills to stay on your feet out there brother, just remember they call it a leap of faith for a reason. Once you've made that decision to jump, you'll already be flying. I'd say take a break from the instagram for a week or two bud, focus on the gratitude for where you're at right now. As I said, perhaps the people in those accounts you follow are sitting on the side of a loud freeway with a blown head gasket, or shivering in their bed cause they ran out of propane, maybe one of them just got crabs.

I think you are right. I need to look at my life, the positives and negatives- and appreciate it for what it is. I should be/am proud of where I have gotten. I have a great job at a great company. I think I am the type of person to have a goal, reach it, and then say ""whats next?"" instead of appreciating my accomplishment.   I think I feel jumpy and just want to do it. Maybe I can take the next year to plan and save up a lot and then start my journey. Maybe I am just so ready to go, the thought of just leaving is overwhelming because I have nothing figured out.   I'll take a break from Instagram and following other people and focus on myself. A lot of people tell me, including my parents, that I need to appreciate what I have done and how far I Have come.

Maybe you could purchase a van and take to living in it urban like while working. It sounds like you have support in your community (family maybe) so they could be a go to. Granted, big life changing approaches are scary to imagine, but small steps can lead you to the big stuff and not create so much anxiety about money and responsibility. I fully understand not wanting to default on the loan but you can find a way to dip your toe in and test the waters and have the best of both worlds. I work full-time at a job in a building and essentially made a personal choice to live in my van instead of paying rent. It just feels more freeing to me.

If so, maybe consider dipping your toes in with getting a van, outfitting it and taking it out on weekends for a while until you get used to it.  Then lose the rent, stealth camp for free and take what you were paying on rent and attack those student loans and van loan until you're debt free.  Then you can be saving a butt load while still having your full time job, enough for when you do quit you're already debt free with a van you can live in and some savings in the bank.  Then get out and explore and take even more awesome photos without the burden of loans and rent.  Enjoy life!!!"

Your stove produces CO and those monitors may or may not give you an accurate reading. There's several variables to consider when placing them and afaik the sensors can become degraded under certain conditions such as overuse.

Europe has used used big vans for years (Mercedes, VW, Fiat, etc) because their fuel is expensive, and now it seems that is trickling into other markets, with the Sprinter leading the way, and other manufacturers trying to emulate its features. The top model VW's have 160-175 horsepower from a 2.0L four cylinder diesel with twin turbos, and good economy at the same time.

vandwellers,34vjoh,shaggy99,2,Thu May 7 21:09:57 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/zgw4e  Mine is an inherited solution that came with my Toyota Chinook, and it was high time I tested it out, so your comment got me to hop outside and hook up the bike. The previous owners of my Chinook used it to take two adult bikes on the back (and two kid bikes on the front on simple bumper mounts) to southern Utah.  I took off the front wheel, pulled the axle, and slipped it into the bracket. The actual hole it mounts in was drilled (not one that came on the bracket). The rear wheel could bounce a bit, but not very much--it's where the weight is. Adding a simple bungee cord would hold it down. This would also be a good way to lock your bike to your vehicle, by running your locking cord through the axle and rear wheel and connecting to the bumper.  There's a little bit of sway left to right that I'll need to take care of that's caused by the bracket being bolted to Plexiglas. To fix it, I'll cut a piece of sheet metal bigger than the bracket and do a ""fish plate"" on both the inside and outside of the vehicle, and then bolt it through that, which will spread the weight out to more of the Plexiglas. That slight sway would eventually weaken the Plexiglas."

We even have a spare room there with a couch and an induction cooker and there is a gym just a mile away or so.  I'm worried about such an expensive first van. I have the electrical knowledge to plan a system similar to Lee's but that's about it. Other than what I've read over the last few days I know nothing else. I'd really like to be able to stand up though and those Nissan's are so nice. I'd incorporate an e-bike, with the motor through the drive train, with the van as I have experience with them for several years and they are very practical and can even haul heavy loads in low gears. I'd like a few years on the road, some BLM and also touring the national parks.  If I could save money living that life style vs staying put, it's sealed but I'd need a steady reliable internet connection to maintain my current income or try to support myself in other ways which right now feels similar to straining to see in total darkness.

I might be able to find slightly better money somewhere else, maybe even 50% more, but there are perks. So long as my projects are completed, there is total freedom. Even so, with each new project it gets a little harder to manage the total accumulated responsibility and eventually it will all blow up. I've been there for 10 years and we process a ton of health care and other data for cheap and it's all home-made so I think it's just a small company that relies heavily on their employees and then the gamble no one will be hit by a bus and so long as everything continues they can retire in a decade.

vandwellers,34sbma,perradimeshift,3,Mon May 4 03:26:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean when you say ""custom"". Do you mean making a bed from scratch or something?  Everyone is different when it comes to beds. Some like it firm, others soft. Look on amazon and find the right one for you. Order a twin. Cut off what you don't need. A lot of people use mattress toppers or foam instead since its easier to cut, but those options may not be as firm/thick as you'd like.  I just ordered this mattress: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G02ESA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  I looked through the reviews and I knew it was right for me. One review said he was 300 lbs, and he couldn't even touch the bottom of the bed when he puts his weight on the bed with his knee. I like my mattress moderately firm bc of lower back pain. Some guy even asked ""Can I cut this mattress to fit in my RV?"" And another guy said he already cut his and its working fine. It's all about reading the reviews!  I'm not cutting mine, so I don't know the best thing to use for cutting. It doesn't need to be perfect since it will be covered by sheets. This guy sawed his off and then duct taped it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72YLRVgejiE"
vandwellers,34sbma,jaquade,1 point,Mon May 4 05:22:02 2015 UTC,Slept on mine a few times so far and it's super comfy. I guess we'll find out next year if it gets dippy or not.

I guess it is one of the most popular on Amazon.  EDIT: now that I have read even more reviews on it. this mattress has so many mixed feelings from the reviewers. some say too soft, others say way too firm. Some say it helps their back, others say it made it worse. Some say it has lost its shape over time, others have not. Honestly, for 100 bucks, if this thing wears out in a year, I won't even be upset. I guess you get what you pay for. Mine is going to be delivered today, I'll let ya guys know."
vandwellers,34sbma,jaquade,2,Mon May 4 12:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah for $100 if it lasts a year I'd be ok with that. I like how thick it is. It had never occurred to me to cut a mattress, maybe I can run it through a table saw. Please let me know how you like it. I had a tempurpedic for years and over time it did lose its shape and actually made my back hurt worse (in the beginning it was awesome). They can also be very hot. I think I would put some cotton blankets over a mattress like that."
vandwellers,34sbma,jaquade,1 point,Mon May 4 14:59:25 2015 UTC,I just ordered one and will be sleeping on it next week. I'm going to cut it to fit my frame.

I might put it up in the attic just to let it breathe and expand since I don't have space right now. I was also thinking... if this thing does go to shit, I can just cut it up and make my own cushions out of it and make shift a couch/chair or something."
vandwellers,34sbma,jaquade,1 point,Tue May 5 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"So I got it. Inflated instantly. Felt nice. I couldn't tell if it was that firm though. You know how that 300 lb dude said he couldn't feel the floor when using his knee? I'm 180 lbs 6'2. I did the same thing and I can definitely tell there is a floor beneath the bed. This doesn't matter though bc when laying normally, I am far from noticing the floor beneath me. But this does question the ""firmness"" he was describing.  I couldn't tell if I was going to like the bed until I slept on it, so I did last night. I woke up this morning with back pain. I had my mattress on the ground. I rolled off my mattress and onto my hardwood floor and laid there to relieve my back.  I know for certain that this mattress is not extremely firm that some people describe it as. It is not extremely soft either. In between. I just felt like I had no support.   I'm going to sleep on it again tonight to make sure its not just me. I hope my body just needs to adjust to the feeling of a different mattress. I think this could be why I am sore, since I've been sleeping on a shitty mattress with a dip in the middle for the past 6 months."
vandwellers,34sbma,jaquade,1 point,Tue May 5 01:30:01 2015 UTC,"Oh interesting. Mine arrives tomorrow and I need something by Sunday. I looked at truck, boat, and RV mattresses but they all cost more than I can afford right now. Also considered a hearty looking cot mattress on Amazon but wasn't sure if 30"" wide was enough. I am 6' tall and about 200 so I'll def feel the floor if you did. Maybe a piece of dense foam underneath?"
vandwellers,34sbma,Sunbolt,1 point,Wed May 6 12:41:49 2015 UTC,"You won't feel the floor if you lay on it normally, just when u step on it. So you won't need any foam. I wish I would have gotten the Twin XL, cause my feet hang off the edge a ton. It is 75 in long, which is 6 feet 2 in. so idk what your set up is, but I wouldn't cut any off unless you have to. It'll be perfect for your height."
vandwellers,34sbma,MegachiropsOnReddit,1 point,Wed May 6 16:44:07 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I have to cut it to be a few inches narrower as I'll sometimes need one of the rear seats in there (I have a minivan). According to what I've read online an electric knife works. The next step will be to make the bed into a good laptop lounge too so I can work comfortably. Just a good back-friendly support for sitting up that's not too space consuming. I also thought about attaching double sided Velcro to the ceiling at the four corners of the bed to hang a mosquito net.
vandwellers,34sbma,stlfreak,1 point,Wed May 6 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see now.  I just took a long 2+ hr nap and I think I'm starting to like it. Back feels better. I think I just had to get adjusted. It is supporting. It is pretty warm too like tempurpedics."

vandwellers,34qb3s,perradimeshift,3,Sun May 3 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with rest areas is the noise coming from the nearby freeway, but other than that, I think that they are generally safe if there are other cars or trucks around. As a rule I prefer to park somewhere where someone is likely to hear me and respond if I lean on the horn in the middle of the night. If I do pull into a rest area to sleep, I prefer to not get out of the car, which means brushing teeth, etc., somewhere else beforehand. That way, it's not immediately obvious that I'm female, and people can imagine that I am a 7-foot tall marine sleeping next to my glock in my minivan.   But honestly, it's so easy to find a quiet residential area, pull over somewhere, and crawl into the back of the van to sleep. Just don't linger too long in the morning if you plan to ever re-use that same spot. If you're tired of driving but not ready to sleep, head to McDonald's, park next to the building, and blaze away on their excellent free wifi until you're ready to turn in, then drive a few blocks to nearby neighborhood and start counting sheep!"
vandwellers,34qb3s,Persona_Transplant,2,Sun May 3 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm female too so love hearing from other women. I will just pretend I'm that 7 foot marine who is locked and loaded lol. I was unprepared for the many emotions I'm feeling around this now that it's turning real (nervousness, fear, sadness, uncertaintly,loneliness etc), but i think it's just the anticipation more than the reality. I'm not an early riser in general, but sounds like van dwelling may change my sleep habits."
vandwellers,34qb3s,munginella,4,Sun May 3 21:49:02 2015 UTC,"Another female vandweller here. You'll be okay, and you'll get used to sleeping in weird places. In a week or two, it'll all be normal. I like to remind myself that nobody who wants to break into your vehicle for petty reasons wants to deal with the possibility of there being someone in there, ready to fight back. Thieves prefer easy-in easy-out with no confrontation. I don't try to make it obvious that I'm sleeping in my van, but I want someone who looks in the window to wonder if there's someone in there.  The idea of finding a place to sleep is always daunting. My advice is to drive around and find somewhere before it gets dark. Scope it out- are there other vehicles parked there? Any RV's? Other vans? Have a plan. Walmarts and Lowes' are always safe bets. Rest stops, too. Gas stations in an emergency also work. Make sure not to overstay your welcome and have backups in case you get hassled.   Also, like the above poster, find a parking lot where you can hang out until 9-10pm and use the wifi. Starbucks and McDonalds are good calls. Stay entertained - getting bored means feeling lonely and scared. My suggestion: download a season of a feel-good TV show. My guilty pleasure is Gilmore Girls. Takes up a few hours every night and I go to bed feeling pretty positive.  Anyway, the emotions you're feeling are totally normal. My first three days living in a vehicle consisted of me driving to Texas from Wisconsin and being alone with my thoughts. It was horrible. I cried a lot, questioned my sanity, and wanted to undo everything.   I promise it gets better. The freedom is exhilarating. And the longer you do it, the more fun it is to tell people, ""I live in a van"". The people who are excited for you are the ones you want to be friends with.  A quick shameless plug: I wrote a blog post recently on vandwelling tips. My blog contains a mixture of topics, mostly fitness and vandwellers who are also climbing bums (""dirtbags""), but it might be useful to you."
vandwellers,34qb3s,munginella,2,Mon May 4 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"That was an insanely useful blog post and reply, a thousand thank yous! You brought up a few things I hadn't thought of, like a really good cooler and a drive full of movies. So it sounds like Walmart lots are pretty reliable. I'll have to scope one out while I'm learning the ropes. I would love to park in shade but maybe that's getting ambitious. I also wondered about mosquitoes and whether I could hang a mosquito net inside my van. I always think 'male' when I think of van dwelling but I'm seeing a surprising number of women at this. Btw, although I was never that great at rock climbing, I did spend a year living in the boulder caves and camp 4 among the Yosemite big wall climbers many moons ago. Wiley crew, fun experience."

vandwellers,34oapu,Square_Ballz,5,Sun May 3 01:41:04 2015 UTC,"I have one. I believe they only work with pots that contain iron, such as steel. For mine at least, it's challenging to cook with at first because the whole pan heats up instantly, a lot faster than I would expect from gas. They are crazy efficient: about 95% or more of the energy goes straight to the pot compared to the ~30% energy transfer of gas. It may be possible for it to interfere with other electrical equipment though."
vandwellers,34oapu,regular_traveller,3,Sun May 3 05:25:57 2015 UTC,I believe its a low frequency field that is all absorbed by the pot base.  Not recommended if you have a pacemaker but should otherwise be fine.

They do this from trends of previous times in terms of, say, water usage and heating costs per membership per quarter. The percentage of people showering there everyday would have to increase, and even then, every membership presents the possibility of someone visiting every single day and showering each time. I'm sure they have this covered.  Besides, those showers are often not ideal compared to home showers so there are always people paying for hot water they choose to not use."

(Obviously with much more technical terms but that's all I could understand from the whole thing.)   Then I came across cheaprvliving.com. Seems like it was written by someone who knows what it's like to not understand stuff yet :D http://www.cheaprvliving.com/basics-solar-power/ is a great page to start understanding the fundamentals of solar power. There are pages on installation too but I haven't gotten to them yet. But I have read a few other pages on the site and they're all written in an easy-to-understand way.  Hope this helps!!"
vandwellers,34oro2,breakfastfire,2,Mon May 4 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"I came across the blog below.  He has a lot of knowledge.  He also links to a book about RV electrics.  I think simplistically you start a sketch of what you want to run.  Not just a light, but how many lights, computers, fans, etc.  All the amps will need to be added up to see what size system you are considering.  When you see the costs in other replies, you can see frugality pays.  Good luck  https://handybobsolar.wordpress.com/"
vandwellers,34oro2,teambob,2,Sun May 3 09:15:10 2015 UTC,Have you thought about a fridge that is dual LPG and 12v?
vandwellers,34oro2,slambarz,1 point,Mon May 4 04:56:07 2015 UTC,See honestly I don't know what either of those things mean. I have no real knowledge on electricity when it comes to watts and volts and amps
vandwellers,34oro2,TheUtomjording,2,Mon May 4 18:35:36 2015 UTC,LPG is propane.
vandwellers,34n9da,abcocktail,12,Sat May 2 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"I've seen posts from some on this sub by van dwellers who go that way. I think it depends on the dwellers personality and their location. When I was starting out I got several ""abandoned vehicle"" stickers placed on my van by the police to get me to leave. I received a letter from a neighborhood watch group asking me to leave stuck under my windshield wiper. I was woken up twice by the cops when staying in San Francisco. Once a rent a cop shook and banged on my van for 10 minutes when I was parked in a business complex's parking lot. After that I learned to blend in better, be more stealthy."
vandwellers,34n9da,batshitcrazy69,8,Sat May 2 18:45:52 2015 UTC,Were you parking in the same locations?  How did you get more stealthY?
vandwellers,34n9da,batshitcrazy69,8,Sat May 2 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Here's what ended up working for me. Don't just park your van in a spot and live out of it, day in, day out. I had two vehicles when I was van dwelling, so I would wake up, drive to where I parked my truck and park around the corner from it, swap to my truck and drive to work. Getting off work, I'd reverse this, then drive the van and do whatever. When I was ready to sleep, I'd drive to one of the spots I liked (not around houses, usually on the street, under a tree in the overflow parking of a large apartment complex. Around marinas are nice too. I never tried Walmart lots), and slip into the back of the van. I'd never get out of the van during this time, just slip back into the front in the morning when I was ready to go."
vandwellers,34n9da,DasBarenJager,5,Sat May 2 20:36:59 2015 UTC,Did you have a chem toilet in the van?
vandwellers,34n9da,urbanvandweller,6,Sat May 2 22:11:25 2015 UTC,I have a collection of abandoned vehicle stickers. I just peel them off when I see them.
vandwellers,34n9da,crockett5,9,Sat May 2 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's probably more about location than anything. Personally I've never worried much about stealth other than blacking out my windows and making sure I don't have any light bleed at night (can't see I have lights on at night).  Hell even in the day time with my windows cracked open, you would be amazed how often people will not realize someone is in the van.   I honestly don't see stealth as a major concern but on the other hand there are likely a few places I could park easier if I was driving a plain white cargo van with no windows. However who the hell wants to be bottled up into a van with no windows. On the other hand, if I were doing more hiking and camped away from my van then I'd probably go for a no window van for security of my stuff while I was away."
vandwellers,34n9da,stealth-van,3,Sat May 2 20:06:16 2015 UTC,Seems like a plain white cargo can would be less attractive to theives than something that looks like a camper.  Camper says you have stuff to steal.
vandwellers,34n9da,morehawes,6,Sun May 3 01:25:00 2015 UTC,I think it goes the other way too - cargo vans say you have tools/equipment to steal.
vandwellers,34n9da,urbanvandweller,9,Sun May 3 06:20:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on if you are living in a major city or not.  If you are in a major city stealth is number 2 right after proper insulation/heating.  Usually LEOs will let you move on, other times they will harass you and arrest you and go through your van, wrecking all your personal items."
vandwellers,34n9da,Minivan2016,8,Sat May 2 19:36:51 2015 UTC,Has this happened to you? What did they wreck? When you say arrest do they take you in too? How long where you in the bucket?
vandwellers,34n9da,urbanvandweller,4,Sat May 2 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah LEOs can be dicks. I've had it happen to me three times.  Two on the road from NYC to San Francisco.  Yeah, I don't know if it counts as being 'arrested' but they detain you by the road in handcuffs and ask you questions and then dig through your van like Nazi's looking for contraband or weapons or bombs or who knows.  I have never got taken to jail.  After they don't find anything, they just tell you to GTFO and never come back.  This has happened when I am parked someplace I shouldn't be out of desperation."

vandwellers,34n9da,One_Awesome_Inch,5,Wed May 6 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"Stealth means less hassles... not no hassles,  but less. Less hassles = better life."
vandwellers,34n9da,Persona_Transplant,5,Sat May 2 22:30:27 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm spending a lot of time dwelling in a friend's driveway with their permission, and it's awesome, partly because I can relax about stealth a little bit, which I am enjoying. A few of the neighbors have figured out that I'm sleeping in the van, but it's private property, so - welcome to the neighborhood.    But when I'm on the street or on the road, stealth is pretty much my guiding principle, and I love the hell out of my mini-van for being so under-the-radar.   Last week I was kicked-back in the parking lot of a Home Depot, streaming netflix on their wifi and resting up from a long drive. Obviously someone spotted me, because at closing time a dude with a leaf blower came around and started basically blowing the perimeter of my car, while peering into the windows. Hint taken.   Sometimes people who are contemplating this lifestyle seem to think that they won't care about stealth, or about what other people will think of them for living in a van, but frankly that is naive. A millionaire baseball player can afford not to care what others think (and I appreciate that he is adding cachet to our lifestyle choice), but the rest of us can and will be considered homeless, and can find ourselves harassed, judged, or worse under the wrong circumstances.   It's a beautiful life, and I love it, but I think that everyone who lives it should have a stealth mode."
vandwellers,34n9da,ambulancechaser1,3,Sun May 3 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"Stealth is important because the average dweller is in a vulnerable state, either financially, physically, or mentally.  Some people would like to take advantage of this vulnerability for their own selfish motives.  Like the noble turtle, most dwellers want to just live in our mobile homes and be left alone.  Just like a turtle, being camouflaged helps protect us from predators.   Metaphors aside, being stealthy protects you from a) criminals b) law enforcement and c) the curious.  Criminals will see a dwellers as an isolated, homeless person with some pawn-able stuff and may try to rob you. Or beat you up for the fun of it.  Law enforcement will perceive you as a threat to the community and can do a lot more than you think.  Most will tell you to move along, but what happens when some pissed-off cop breaks your taillight, tows your van, or smashes in your skull because he doesn't want you in his beach community?  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yggQ3HbO0Wg) Do you really want to expend the time and energy to sue a police department to get your repair or medical bills paid for?  The curious can lead to interactions with groups (a) or (b), or just cause other unforeseen problems. Many people misunderstand dwellers and some dwellers give the rest of us a bad name.   But, to each their own.  My experiences have been that the social stigma of being dwelling to be a large obstacle to living a normal life, and I've stopped telling people I am interested in dwelling."
vandwellers,34n9da,gthing,3,Sun May 3 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but I know I feel a lot better being a bit stealthy."
vandwellers,34n9da,Bouncer827,3,Sun May 3 06:15:34 2015 UTC,Stealth can be very important. Some places can fine you up to $500 or jail you Florida comes to mind especially Sarasota area.

vandwellers,34mrww,urbanvandweller,3,Sat May 2 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"My family and I were looking for a parking spot last night in a new neighborhood we were visiting. We found a spot in a slightly down hill road and I went ahead and parked. The rest of the streets were pretty crowded and that spot was just as crowded except for a small section which was the one I mentioned. Once parked my family and I got out of the rv and checked to make sure the tires were aligned and the rv was spaced properly against the curbed. Then I got back inside the driver seat and I noticed that down at the intersection below 3 individuals either came around the corner, or got out of an Green Astro Van. For the record we parked right on the middle portion of the street. Under bright light.  I noticed that 2 of the individuals who clearly looked like gang bangers, bald heads / baggy clothes, moved urgently up the street. It was 3 of them and 2 cross the street to our side from down at the intersection and moved up toward my family member who was still outside. The other stayed on the other side of the street and walked up. I told my family member to quickly get back inside the rv and to close the doors. I then mentioned the fact that they were gang members with very likely malicious intentions. Thankfully my family member got back inside, closed the door, locked it, then rolled the windows. As the 2 gang members passed they greet us saying that it was a good night and passed by. Quite nice of them  So my family and I are sitting there talking about it and we hear a couple of sharp whistle calls. My family member said that they had stopped on the end of the street and were hanging out there. eventually they moved to the opposite side of the street (Driver side) and came down a couple of feet. I could see them on my drive side mirror. Then one of the 2 gang members crossed to the middle of the street and walked down to the vehicle. He passed by me, next to me, looking inside, My family member then told me that 2 more were coming down on the sidewalk (passenger side) we were parked on. So all of them came down again and began to circle around the rv. Then one guy moved up against my window and knocked on it wanting me to roll it down. I wasn't going to do that. Then he started talking saying:  ""Hey, we just want to let you guys know that nothing bad is going to happen to you guys.""  And started to say that he wanted to talk to us. Like step out and talk to us or roll down the window and talk to us. That we were safe and no one was going to hurt us. That we could stay here the night with out any problems. Obviously I did not do it and he started to repeat that no one was going to hurt us, that we could stay here, and other things to try and make us feel comfortable. So I went ahead and said no thank you and I fired up the engine. So I am getting ready to leave but can't because these 3 guys are on the street side. Then they take a couple of steps back and I try to go but I had forgotten that we use a piece of wood on the tires of the RV because it has no emergency break. So I hit reverse.... and back up, but then the guys come up again. Then one yelled loudly.  ""Hey Homie What you got in that ride?!""  And the other guy held him back. Then one notices the piece of wood and picks it up. He walks over and says he will give it to me if I roll down the window. I say no. These guys had their eyes pretty red, and I am not sure but perhaps their pupils were slightly dialiated. Though mainly I recall seeing their eyes as somewhat red. So I engage ""D"" and pull away from the curb, and the gang members backed away, and we drive off.  It was a bad situation. Their intent was clear. They behaved like a pack of wolves. Circling around the rv, moving up and down, and just gave off an overall predator like demeanor. Thankfully we are safe and thankfully no one pulled out a gun. If that had happened I sure as hell would have had to floor the gas pedal and drive off even if the guys had been close to the rv. Heck, I wouldn't have stayed there and get shot down. Not that I would have likely made it past the first shot or anything, but in my mind I saw my self ducking, pulling, and flooring. I know, it would not have worked out well at all, but I was dumb for staying longer than I should have. Best option was not to wait and instead just fire up the engine then leave when they passed the first time and left. We are not going to return to that neighborhood ever again. I'm sure they got the rv targeted and are not happy that we left there with out them being able to do something.  Thank you god for letting me and my family return once again to daily life and for me and my family to be together still. I am not sure what I COULD have done if my family member had not moved quickly enough, or would not have been close enough. I do martial arts, like Boxing and Muay Thai but I have only started just recently around... I think it was... October of last year. I also took a 2 month break while trying to secure funds for the van I drive now. It was really tough since I still attend college. So I really don't have much exp in those arts. My base when I first started to practice MA has been KENDO. This was again after a Roomate started to act weird, aggressive, and was likely under the influence of drugs that I felt the need to defend myself. But at the time I did not know there were SPORTS martial arts and other more aggresive types of martial arts for the streets.  I can't help but think that I started training all too late in life."
vandwellers,34mrww,urbanvandweller,3,Sat May 2 17:27:40 2015 UTC,At then end of the day they might have a gun which shoots 20 gram bullets. You have a 1 ton vehicle. If you are worried you can get the three front windshield bullet proofed with a special film.  A vehicle is a much more dangerous weapon than a gun.  I would have left when the first guys stayed behind.  Living in the streets in a van you learn to recognize what is deviant human behavior and what is not.  I think it was a mistake to stay that long once you realized how deviantly the men were acting.   And you def. do not want to engage groups of people in any type of conflict. You will always loose.  Just GTFO as fast as possible.
vandwellers,34mrww,urbanvandweller,3,Sat May 2 19:55:23 2015 UTC,"You are right the first time around it was a big mistake. I felt lucky since if they had taken a gun out at my face, point blank, with only the window in between I am not sure what I would have done.   I really wanted to stay and see what would happen though. When they passed us up and greeted us saying that it was a good night... I felt something was up, but could not understand why. It was odd that those bald thugs were acting so nicely... and were also walking up the street so fast.. in a hurry. My gut instinct told me something was up and I told my family to get inside. Thankfully my family did get inside and we were safe. Then I stuck around with out going to the back of the RV to sleep. I just told my family that I wanted to see what was going on. They were whistling on the block up behind us.. and I was keeping watch on the mirrors. They then crossed to the other side of the street on the driver side, walked downd half way, paused and talked to one another. Then crossed the street to our side... one came down my side then another on the passenger and they circled the van. The rest were their tongues trying to get us to open the door. A pretty bad situation but... something made me stay. I was lucky.  How much is the film to make the 3 windows at the front bullet proof?  You are right even if I and end up unlucky enough to engage them... there is no winner out of that outcome. Still, I have to continue my training because you can't always run from everything :(."
vandwellers,34mrww,waynep712222,2,Sat May 2 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"This thread is making me paranoid :/  Anyway, I doubt that this ""bullet proof film"" would work. Some products I found googling are 8mm thick (this would cause trouble/distortion seeing through it). Also consider, if it was that easy, banks and military vehicles would use it, but they don't - they use very thick glass or polycarbonate instead.  I feel like the best defense would be prevention? It would be great if there was a map with vehicle theft/robbery, centered on RVs. This way, you'd know where not to park. Hey, there's an idea for an app.."
vandwellers,34mrww,waynep712222,-1,Sat May 2 23:28:03 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the makers of the film be left with a liability if it didn't work well?

vandwellers,34mrww,Persona_Transplant,5,Mon May 4 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they have criminals in every city man. Just avoid the really bad parts of town.  The 'gang members' I have ran into are usually poor African Americans that are trying to sell me illegal drugs or prostitutes.  They are just trying to make some money.  Violence is usually bad for any business. My vehicle/clothing is not expensive looking, which i think is the primary reason I have not been a target of robbery.  If you are really concerned you can install bars on the inside of the windows so that when they break the windows to gain access to the van they won't be able to get in.  You could also own a few firearms.    Myself, I have neither.  I have a train horn installed under my vehicle connected to a car battery that I can operate as a panic button.  It is very loud and using it repeatedly for over 5 minutes wil l bring lots of attention and LEOs.  I only use it when the rare car thief is casing out my van.  IMO LEOs harassment is way more common than deviant humans.    I have had problems with drunks and young kids before though."
vandwellers,34mrww,Persona_Transplant,3,Sat May 2 19:45:41 2015 UTC,Thanks. How do you go about getting the bars for the windows? Is it a custom job? I knew an old RV guy who did that for his old RV. Looked pretty nice. Though I think that is more of a long term stuff and I want to move out of the van before the end of this year. It's a 2004 Chevrolet Express Passenger Van. With all that has happened it makes me feel like having so many windows is not such a great idea. Can't help but think of a few thugs thinking we have lots of electronics inside busting the windows to get in from different angles. Not sure what I'd do then. I have just recently started tying the passenger and drive doors from the handle to the base of the chairs as a prevention in case they bust the windows and try to open the door. Most of the time the rear windows in the van get covered up when we go rest in the back (Carton/Black Plastic set up) so people don't peek inside. Makes me think cargo might have been a better option since it takes a bit of time to put it up at night before going to bed (At which point we are already pretty tired and just want to sleep instead of doing that). Thing is cargos are usually pretty dirty inside when bought used. They also have more miles than passenger vans. The guys that came up to me where Latinos since we have been around latino heavy areas.   How much was the train horn? That seems like a great thing to have. How fast does it drain the battery? I bet when you use it the guy takes off like a jet lol.   Is this your set up?  http://www.cherokeeforum.com/attachments/f2/29120d1288905060t-train-horns-29711570024_large.jpg

vandwellers,34mrww,waynep712222,1 point,Sat May 2 21:57:58 2015 UTC,How much do you think a job like that would cost? The thing is that I don't want to stay in the van very long.

One is the radiator water, circulating at about 80c (175f) with engine warmed up.  The other is your shower water, which soaks up the heat through the copper piping, and can get up to quite hot temperatures. Depends if you keep it circulating into a hot tank, or just heat it and use it. Temp will depend on how fast the water flows through, efficiency of your exchanger, size of your engine, ambient temp, etc.  You can tap into the hot water lines that run to the vehicles heater core under the dash, putting the heat exchanger in series so the heater still works as normal when you aren't pumping shower water through the exchanger and stealing the heat.

Still to me Plan A or B seems like the best design to me. It gives you under bed storage and if you build your bed 28 to 30 inches wide, you have lots of room for a walkway area and shelving on the other side. With my setup, my bed will be 30 inches and will be building my kitchen to be 15 inches wide by 4 ft long (enough room for a permanently mounted 1 burner stove, sink, 7 gallon aqua tainer water storage and counter space.

The next day I looked at it in the light and maybe one of the windows was quality. I did a bunch of research, but nothing really prepares you for what you're getting yourself into. If you do decide to do it yourself, research into the brands of tint and talk to a professional who has done it before. You're also going to need a heat gun. This is crucial if you want to get a clean bubble free finish. The heat gun will allow the tint to stretch and form itself to the window so you don't have to do it in strips. I tried to use a hair dryer because I was cheap, and it just didn't work. Honestly, I would say go to a shop that has the window shape in their computer system and have them cut and install everything. Like others have said, it may be a tad more expensive, but it is quality work that is guaranteed, being done by people who do it for a living.

vandwellers,34l6gp,vand2000,2,Sat May 2 03:10:25 2015 UTC,"Your power demand is insane! Haha I could never imagine 8 or 10 batteries in my van and that much solar. But it does sound like you want to power a lot.  A few pointers: Make sure those Sam's Club batteries are true deep cycles and not just marine batteries. In fact, I would recommend investing in some heavy duty batteries like the Trojan T105 or similar. With that much power going through the system you're going to have a lot of ""wear"" and maintenance. Invest in a rock solid inverter, 2000w would be best.  Expect 5 solid hours of solar charging on the sunniest of days. Remember that your panels are flat and can only get optimum sun from around 10am to 3pm. Do not expect to reasonably run an AC unit from a 12v source. Even after the efficiency loss from inverting 12v to 110v (which is a lot for that kind of load), your A/C may only run for an hour or two at most before killing your batteries."
vandwellers,34l6gp,EndTheCause,1 point,Sat May 2 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"If i can get much longer battery life by discharging 20-50%, and since it's good to buy batteries in a single batch and use them the same way, I figure 8 or 10 batteries would allow expanding power consumption in the future without replacing the whole battery bank with a new, bigger batch. It would also allow at least ventilation to be powered for a few days without charging. From what I read, the Trojans could last 8 years, and the Sam's club maybe 6 years, so at 2x the price it might not be economical if i can get true golf cart batteries, especially if during the day the heat in the car is 100°F, which will decrease the longevity of any battery. That is why I considered insulation and AC, perhaps it would help increase battery life by keeping a lower temperature during the day, and the insulation would make it so it needs to run maybe 4 hours every 24hrs. It would also keep air dry to prevent mold (if in FL) and increase comfort. I don't have any real-world experience to say whether insulation could make that work, and if my location is CA, it's already dry enough to make fans a good alternative.  Perhaps it's better to setup 4 batteries in series, with two such sets in parallel, to make a 24V system if the set-up from 12V to 120V takes so much power. It seems the AC is the biggest problem, and at 5 hours a day of charging, I couldn't charge more than 2500Wh, not taking into consideration efficiency loss. That gives me a good idea of a sustainable power load, and leads me to believe it would be best to start with a big fan, which uses about 60W. I'm not sure how people typically setup the airflow intake and output... is fresh air coming through the roof at the front and ventilated out through the roof in the rear? Or brought in through the rear door and ventilated out through the roof in the front...?"
vandwellers,34l6gp,crockett5,1 point,Sat May 2 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"First off scrap a mini fridge idea.. get a real 12v compressor fridge. This and the lap top are very easy to manage. A good quality 12v fan works just as well as a regular fan.. again easy.. 2x 6v batteries wired to 12v would run that fairly easy. on say 200-220ah. You would also have a few days of coast in between great sunny charge days.  The silliness comes in with the microwave & air conditioner. As far as the microwave it's probably doable, but it's something you will have to test and research. Yea it gonna use a lot of power but it should be for quick short amounts of time.  What you would need to test, is is it better to get a low watt model or a higher watt model. (I did briefly test a 700w microwave on my previous system, it ran but I only had 200w of solar so I didn't end up using it)  The low watt microwaves tend to cook slower but use less power. Meanwhile the bigger microwaves tend to cook faster but use more power. I could only say to try and test cooking your normal meal in a high power on and a low power one to see which uses the most power in the end..  Again it's doable but something you will need to test..  As for the AC unit.. I have actually seen small window units running off 12v battery systems charged by solar. Look around on youtube there are a few videos. Meaning it is possible. I think one guy had about 500w of solar and 2x 12v batteries if I recall.   Again it's probably possible to figure out how to do all this, but you will be spending money on your system. If you have the money to throw at it you could probably make it work with enough testing of things.   Personally if it were me.. I'd buy maybe 300w of panels and a pair of the batteries then go pick up a small AC and start testing. Don't go crazy buying 600w of panels and 8 6v batteries until you know for 100% that you can make it run the AC unit. Start testing the microwave as well at this point.   Also keep in mind unless you buy the AGM deep cycles you will have to do battery maintenance on those batteries and they will produce gas. With that many batteries, I wouldn't want them gassing into the same area I was sleeping.. You will need to build a sealed cabinet and vent them outside. I'd likely build a sealed cabinet for them at the back door then vent them outside with a small computer fan to help move air. Just make a easy access door so you can check the fluid levels of the batteries with out much hassle."
vandwellers,34l6gp,urbanvandweller,1 point,Sat May 2 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. Definitely, the microwave is a luxury, but a very cherished one used to heat milk for breakfast and beans/soup for supper. I envision 5 minutes of use per day. At about 600W, that should use 50 Wh each day. The minifridge, at 230 kWh per year, is 630Wh per day.  If I can get a good idea of my power budget, that would narrow the list of possible options. The E-250 ha a width of 52.5 inches, cargo length 158.7 inches. So 4ft x 13ft = 52sqft of possible solar panels. I am assuming 1 sqft of solar panels can yield max 12 W. So my maximum charging rate is 624 W, times a maximum solar insolation of about 6 hours, = 3744 Wh before accounting for efficiency losses. If I can get 85% efficiency, my average power budget each day cannot exceed about 3100Wh. If I use a 60W fan for 8 hours while sleeping, that’s about 500Wh. The fridge+microwave is 700Wh. I found a portable AC unit FRA053PU1, 5000 BTU that draws 580W, so I have about 3 hours of use per night. With only 300 cu ft to cool, if it runs only 33% of the time (3 out of 8 hours), I’m within my power budget. Nights are usually cool enough for comfort, so I envision that an AC would serve as a backup at the height of summer. If I can get a good figure for what % of the time the AC runs to keep a van cool, and what kind of effect insulation would give, that would solidify my idea that this is firmly in the realm of possibilities.  Additionally, with my sustainable power budget listed above, I can now determine how many batteries I would need. At an 20% discharge, I would need 15,000 Wh of storage, and at 50% discharge, 6,000 Wh. So between 5 and 11 6V 225Ah batteries. This leads to the next decision: 24V or 48V system? The 48V inverters are twice as expensive as the 24V, but I think they cause less power loss during the voltage step-up. The best deal I found is a Nimble NL800 48V 1000W inverter for $206 there are no product reviews to judge their reliability. The other 48V inverters run over $1000. My best idea right now is eight 6V batteries in series, which is right in the middle of my storage requirements.   So the one question I am still researching is what % of the time the AC would run at night. I really think that the worst-case scenario is the 3 hours before midnight, and after that the temperatures almost always normalize. I also welcome helpful corrections on my assumptions above. I hope these calculations also help others in their plans."
vandwellers,34hajt,fulfilled-life,10,Fri May 1 03:33:42 2015 UTC,Nice! I'm actively looking for the right used sprinter myself. What made you decide to go with the shorter wheelbase over the longer models?
vandwellers,34hajt,BongoBuddy,5,Fri May 1 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"Also wondering if there is a benefit to the dual wheel model, or if that's just what was available.  I think the single wheel model takes a payload around 1000-1200 kg and has much more floor space between the wheel wells. I don't expect many people carry more than a metric tonne around in their vans."
vandwellers,34hajt,stealth-van,3,Fri May 1 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"I went with the dual wheel model for a few reasons:   Stability in windy environments. Driving across Texas had gusts of wind that were 40mph, which led to some white knuckle driving. My understanding is hat the single rear wheels would have been worse to drive.  I want to be able to go off the grid for several weeks at a time, which means lots of water and batteries. Which are heavy.  I love the idea of converting to an electric vehicle one day (several years from now). That will need more batteries and so the extra capacity will be great to have.  I prefer to be far under capacity, than near the max. The vehicle will behave better while driving around.  going off-road on BLM land should still be do-able. This is the biggest drawback to the dually for me.  the wheel wells are pretty low, and I designed a few different floor layouts and felt like it was a trade off I was happy with."

vandwellers,34hajt,stealth-van,1 point,Fri May 1 19:14:37 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm aware of. The main issue with taking dually's offroad is that rocks can get stuck between the wheels, and that can puncture a tire, or create really bad wear in the side walls.  I found a few forum posts of folks that take their dually's offroad regularly and seemed fine. If you are going to avoid rocky trails or jeep trails I imagine it's ok (will find out eventually!)"

It might be a tad bit stealthier than a longer wheel base, which is helpful too :)   I checked out a few used Sportsmobiles that had the long wheel base. They felt huge! Also it felt like they had some wasted space (I don't need two couches for example).   Overall I'm trying to be more minimalist, and not collect so much stuff. The short wheel base also helps with that."
vandwellers,34hajt,tron103,8,Fri May 1 15:43:54 2015 UTC,Take plenty of photos when you do the insulation.  Some people add expanding foam to the vehicle but it's messy and can cause rusting out if there is moisture buildup underneath.   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=van+foam+insulation  I've been thinking about just installing polystyrene sandwich panel so that it can be removed later without a trace. It means losing some space because it's minimum 50mm thick but it's a great insulator. Especially if you go 75-100mm thickness (freezer panel) which can maintain a deep freeze (-18c) in 40c (105F) ambient temps so you know it's good.  http://www.grv4fridgevans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MWB1.jpg  http://www.vanfridge.co.uk/images/-20degFreezerVanPack.JPG  http://www.whatsyourtemperature.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_04181.jpg
vandwellers,34hajt,One_Awesome_Inch,2,Fri May 1 06:29:43 2015 UTC,"This is awesome! Thanks for sharing the details.  Foam insulation had sounded ideal at the start, but yea it looks like there are a lot of trade offs and side effects.   I don't mind loosing a little interior space, so the freezer panel looks really tempting.   I've also been looking into aerogel insulation. There are a few references to it in this wiki article on r-values). It has a high r-value (10-30), and this version of it looks like it has built in moisture protection.   I'm still doing some research on the material safety of aerogel. It sounds dusty. From one study it looks like the dust is of the harmless variety, but small enough to get deep in the lungs. So maybe it would need to be wrapped in plastic prior to install?   Insulation is my top priority - but it sounds like putting in electrical first is a good idea. So I've been waiting to figure out the electrical portion of things."

vandwellers,34hibt,urbanvandweller,5,Fri May 1 04:55:06 2015 UTC,It's not revolutionary in that it's a new battery technology. It's revolutionary because their factories produce lithium batteries at such a high volume  that the price is reasonably lower.
vandwellers,34hibt,gammaStar,4,Fri May 1 07:32:36 2015 UTC,Quick sums show it's quite expensive per Ah compared to regular leisure batteries.   110 Ah @ £72 = £0.65p/Ah 833 Ah (10k / 12) @ £2312 = £2.76/Ah
vandwellers,34hibt,64mb,4,Fri May 1 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"A Moody's report estimates ""the capital cost of batteries today is closer to $500-600/kilowatt-hour (kWh)."" The Powerwall currently costs $350 per kWh."
vandwellers,34hibt,pseudo_mccoy,4,Fri May 1 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"That isn't the whole picture.  Lead acid batteries cannot handle serious long term deep cycling. You can only use about 50% of the amp/hours you buy, if you want them to last.  They last far fewer cycles than lithium, which can last 4-10x the number of deep cycles, increasing the lifespan and value for money.  Lead acid batteries weigh 3-4x more per amp hour, which consumes fuel to cart them around, and can push you over your vehicle weight limit.  In a mobile application the lithiums already work out cheaper in the long run.  http://www.campertrailers.org/lithium_batteries.htm"
vandwellers,34hibt,ewcsear,2,Sat May 2 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I started to look up the pros/cons of SLA vs Li-Ion after posting this. Undoubtedly awesome technology but at current prices for lithium batteries (unless I'm not looking in the right places and excluding Powerwall) they're still just a tad more expensive than SLA batteries.  Once I can pick up a lithium battery off the shelf for <4-6x (based on the no. cycles) the cost of an SLA battery I'll certainly make the move. I'm hoping with Tesla doing this it will bring down the price on this tech."
vandwellers,34hibt,64mb,3,Sat May 2 07:03:24 2015 UTC,What sort of lithium prices have you seen?  Here is a 12v 100AH for US$610. Only 13kg.  http://www.batteryspace.com/lifepo4-prismatic-battery-12-8v-100ah-1-28-kwh-10c-rate---un38-3-passed-3-2vx4-dgr.aspx  At around US$500 per kW/hr I'd be willing to switch for the weight reduction. I think they would cost less in the long term. A lot of Lead Acids are pretty weak after 200 deep cycles. 2000 with the lithium should last me many years. And a 100A/H that I can run down to 20% charge is like a 160-170AH lead acid that I can only comfortably run down to 50% charge level.   But then I will have more batteries to run a small fridge freezer so weight becomes more of an issue. It draws 30-40 watts when it's running.
vandwellers,34hibt,ewcsear,2,Sat May 2 08:46:58 2015 UTC,"Think we've been looking at the same site. That's a pretty good price but soon jumps after shipping (I'm in the UK). The CA60FI (compact, and almost equivalent to a 100Ah SLA  battery) gets a lot of mentions on the EV forums, doesn't look like a bad cell for a 4S1P or 4S2P setup.  If anyone knows where I can find anything/similar items to what's mentioned, I'd be interested in knowing. Need to change my leisure battery before the summer.  Edit: I worked out some more numbers; the £/Ah in my initial post, taking into account the effective Ah (SLA: 50%, Li-Ion: 80%) it puts the Tesla 10kWh battery at only 2.65 x the £/Ah of the SLA battery. And the one you linked 3.84x £/Wh."
vandwellers,34hibt,64mb,1 point,Sat May 2 14:05:34 2015 UTC,The LiFePO charging/solar regulator gear may also cost slightly more. But at high discharge rates you will see a greater loss of capacity in the lead acid vs the Lithium.  Lead Acids rated at C20 will only deliver half that capacity at C1.  Getting 4x the cycle life from the Lithium to break even on cost doesn't seem impossible.
vandwellers,34hibt,ewcsear,4,Wed May 6 04:29:32 2015 UTC,If its going to be used in a van I'd rather just pick up an EV and use the battery it has while under warranty.

I guess you could probably tear it apart and build some sort of better container to house all the batteries if you really wanted to.  My thinking is you don't really need that much power in a van, but it might be more interesting if there was a way to rework the battery pack into something which fits a van body and then have the ability to charge it at a Telsa station. (neither of which is possible with this) At that point it might make sense to have a bigger battery pack because you could just use it til it was low and then recharge it in like 30 mins.  Telsa wouldn't let you do that though as they aren't even selling parts to people whom crash their cars. Telsa is at a young/vulnerable age and the icon of electric cars. Due to this they are being extremely tight with their spare parts inventories as they don't want someone modifying or fixing a car then get bad press because it caught on fire or something drastic.  $3k is a much better price, I previously saw $15k for their system in another article."
vandwellers,34hibt,crockett5,1 point,Fri May 1 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's probably not practical for DIY projects yet.  7kWh is probably overkill for mobile use (unless maybe you're using it for cooling and heating in extreme weather).  However, if these do take off, I could see Tesla developing smaller scale batteries adapted for mobile usage - water resistant ones for sailboats, UV resistant ones for roof mounting on RV's/vans/minivans.  Heck, maybe even integrate a solar panel and inverter right onto the battery back - nothing to hook up but an outlet.  The potential is quite interesting!"
vandwellers,34hibt,flux8,1 point,Fri May 1 19:46:52 2015 UTC,You could do all that yourself. You can buy the type of batteries they use and turn them into your own battery pack.

vandwellers,34goav,crockett5,1 point,Sat May 2 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"gas/electric is not gonna work very well for off grid unless you run it off the gas and then it's not very efficient. Those 3 way RV fridges are meant to run on 110 plugged in at a campground.  As far as how useful they are it's really up to you and how you eat. I personally have to have a fridge, because when I don't have one I tend to eat very badly. Like cans of soup & lots of fast food and other junk foods.."
vandwellers,34goav,EndTheCause,2,Fri May 1 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"RV fridges work best on gas, a 12 cu/ft refrig (the big tall RV one with separate freezer) sips propane at something like 2400 btu/hr which is nothing. You could easily run a small van fridge for weeks on propane.  On 110v they run anywhere from 2-5 amps, and 12v is the least efficient at 5-15 amps. They all cool the same way, but propane is always the best choice. In a van you could condense to a small ice cooler which goes a few days on ice, or they do make reasonably efficient 12v coolers too.   Personally, I love having a good fridge because I love to cook and keep fresh ingredients and leftover meals ready-to-go. Plus the staples like milk etc are a must. Eating on the road is convenient, but usually unhealthy so I try to avoid it. I cook several meals at once on the weekends, then all I have to do is heat them up and eat. Just food for thought (heh)."
vandwellers,34goav,crockett5,1 point,Fri May 1 05:41:55 2015 UTC,"Those 12v coolers are not very efficient. They will drain your battery dead very fast and usually only cool something like 20 or 30 degrees lower than outside room temperature. They also take hours to get to that point. They all used cold plate cooling/heating which is a horrible way to cool something,.  As for ice in a cooler, where you are likely plays into how well it works. I tried both the 12v cooler & a 5 day ice chest when I started out using my truck. I even wrapped the ice chest in insulation and kept it covered but by the 3rd day the ice was always completely gone. (This was in New England during the summer)  As for the RV fridges, I've always been told they were designed to work from 110 then propane being secondary and the 12v was useless. If they work good on propane then that's a good option. I know the 3 way fridges in Westy's never worked very good on propane but that's also older 80's fridges I guess."
vandwellers,34goav,JohnnyThree,1 point,Fri May 1 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"Gas/Electric are very inefficient as they use the old Absorption cycle and the gas/electric is used just to heat the working fluid.  In my experience they use a huge amount of LPG and get very hot (big fire risk), and above a certain temperature can even reverse and start heating inside. Maybe OK if it is cold, but disastrous out in the hot desert.  The best camping/RV refrigerator is one which uses a true 12V compressor.  Most of them are incredibly efficient, reliable and safe. Ask at a reputable 4WD shop.  I have an old Engel which I bought back in 1975 which is still running continuously, powered by a couple of solar panels and batteries. Engels are expensive, but these days there are much cheaper compressor type camping fridges available.  But stay away from domestic type fridges, as they are woefully inefficient. Have poor insulation, use a heater for defrost, etc, etc.  Also the camping fridges which use Peltier devices are incredibly inefficient. Stay away from them as well."

When I'm 'home' I wear a marmot 700-fill jacket, and have a -25 degree sleeping bag at night. Also a warm beanie.   The nights don't seem that cold, and I tend to sleep warm, but without insulation it is a definite requirement (at least for me).  Parking is pretty tough. But you can do it if you don't mind driving around a little bit. It helps if your van is really stealthy (no windows).   I like the idea of living in warmer climates (outside of SF). Besides taking Bart into the city, there are also Golden Gate Transit routes. Those buses are pretty comfortable, and relatively affordable. I've definitely thought about moving to the North Bay near a GGT line.  For what it's worth - if you move to SF, you will probably still need to take transit to work, as there are not many places where you can leave the vehicle all day."

I'm staying on the East Bay side just because I like it over there as apposed to SF. I don't want to have to take transit any more than necessary so I won't be going all the way out to like Concord. The area around UCB is a good spot. There is so much activity and so many students that you can blend. Also because it's so saturated with people theres like 3 or 4 people to a one bedroom apartment so lots and lots of cars. On my block the same van has been parked there for almost one year.

vandwellers,34eum4,cookieguy10,1 point,Sun May 3 08:26:08 2015 UTC,"I purchased a 1989 Dodge van. It has the two bench seats and the captains chairs. I am removing the middle bench and then, for now, using the other as a fold down bed with a futon. I am not too concerned with much more than that for now other than storing my essentials (things for water, clothing, cleaning, food). I tinted the windows and am having a friend make me curtains. Its pretty stealth in that you cannot see in at night. As for conversions, i do see it as a work in progress. I spent my last $2000 on the van so I need to get more $$ from working to do this. But I don't really need anything at this point because I'm essentially living the urban van life and working full-time. I'm at work 10-12 hours a day and often over time as well. I work in a grocery store so food isn't an issue. I also eat mostly raw foods so cooking isn't an issue. For me it feels a lot more comforting to not make the van look heavily lived in while staying local. If I take to the road I would just bring my camping gear/stove/solar shower. I imagine I will do what I need when it comes up. We can definitely meet. Sometime in the next two weeks would be best after I make my transition. I will stay in touch."
vandwellers,34fd21,CatchMeIfYouVAN,3,Thu Apr 30 18:01:57 2015 UTC,Do you have a power transfer switch installed?

vandwellers,34fd21,maverick_ninefingers,3,Thu Apr 30 23:07:21 2015 UTC,Sounds maximum sketchy to me.  You should consider adding one rather than connecting both your inputs to the circuit breaker which is clearly incorrect/dangerous.  Generator--v            Transfer Switch-->Circuit Breaker-->Outlets   --Shore----^  Sorry I can't offer actual electrician advice to your specific problem.
vandwellers,34fd21,rcrracer,1 point,Fri May 1 00:24:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.  It looks like the transfer switch (from a brief google search) would have to be in a different box and is just a double throw switch which would make it impossible for me to connect shore and generator together.  I may end up using one of those but I wont be around shore power too often so I am not super worried about accidentally flipping both breakers on.  My current set up is as below:  Generator -->  Breaker --> Common AC bar --> Breaker (branch) -->Outlets  Shore -->  Breaker --> Common AC bar --> Breaker (branch) -->Outlets
vandwellers,34fd21,rcrracer,2,Fri May 1 11:56:53 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about what you are doing but:  Is there a chance that you are connecting things together that need to in phase with each other.  Nothing with AC shore power should ever come into contact with AC from the generator. For this to work the 60 cycles per second from both sources would have to be in phase with each other.  Edit:  In house wiring if you put a jumper between the neutral and ground of a GFCE outlet, it will trip.  This is with nothing plugged in and nothing else on that circuit other than the GFCI."
vandwellers,34fd21,JohnnyThree,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I don't think so.  Since the generator is off it does not have any voltage/phase.  Which is what makes this problem so weird.  Since the generator is off, why is interfering with the circuit at all?  And why does connecting the return to return without having the hots connected to anything trip a breaker?  While I was setting up I accidentally connected shore power to the generator and the generator ran ""backwards"" the electric generator started turning without the gas motor being on.  Luckily, there was no damage."
vandwellers,34fd21,JohnnyThree,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"Is there any type of ground fault circuitry? Is the ground always tying back to it's original source?  When you are using the generator, do the ground and neutral only go back to the generator?  When you are using shore power do the ground and neutral only go back to shore power.  If there is ground fault circuitry and the neutral is wired to the ground at any place other than the source there could be a problem. All the current needs to return via the neutral and not split between the neutral and the ground or two neutrals.  You might be paralleling a couple of wires.  (I really know zero about what you are doing. I like /u/maverick_ninefingers reply.  Especially if transfer switches isolate every wire, hot, neutral, and ground.)"

Not expensive to fix but scarey when it happened.  brake lines broke on both my older vans at some point too .  so safety check before hittin the road

Right off there are side streets that are along shops or the side of apartments etc... The only thing posted is street cleaning. I move around a lot, only been to same spot a couple times off of Olympic. Prefer to be near apartments and or 24 hour businesses. OH on Sunday 31st street and Ocean Park in SaMo is a daytime spot to hang with free parking all day, 24 Hour fitness, coffee bean and some other little restaurant right there. Otherwise you can meter park there anyway up to 9 hours at a time, just not between 3-5am.   Honestly, from what I have seen, if you blend in and don't have too much activity going on, nobody even notices you. Had someone I know walk right past my limo tinted windows. I froze until I realized he had no clue there was even a person in there much less someone he knows living here."

The South/Central American governments had problems with people driving cars into their countries, then claiming they were destroyed in accidents but actually selling them on the black market.  IIRC, there was all sorts of bureaucracy they had to deal with to be able to drive their car across these countries.  No idea if it's still an issue, but it's definitely something to research beforehand!  The second thing to consider, of course, would be how to handle crossing the Darien Gap.

Not to say crime doesn't happen in rural areas, but its more like the scale of drunken redneck brawls vs getting shot for wearing a blue shirt in wrong neighborhood. Good thing about being a van dweller is, if you are in a bad spot or dangerous situation, you can turn the key and flee it.  If you get even a hint of a bad feeling, trust it and move on. Might bring bear mace with you just in case, for intended use and for other uses."

vandwellers,34aymq,talkstogoats,11,Wed Apr 29 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"This situation is presently screwed up and not very logical.  Gypsies are problematic.  The basic problem is that health insurance is based on your state of domicile (residency).  If you're traveling, then your location may not match your legal domicile.  Total pain in the ass.  Take two aspirin and read on.  First and urgent thing is to check is whether your policy covers emergency treatment in the state where you are presently parked.  Chances are it does.    If you have an accident, get your emergency treatment locally, and then (very important) return to the state where you have full coverage for the rest of your treatment.  If you stay in the state where you do not have full coverage, you will be liable for the bill for non-emergency treatment (your insurance will not pay).  Note that time in the general hospital or a rehabilitation setting may not be considered emergency treatment.  People get screwed by this on a regular basis.  Do not expect the hospital or the doctors treating you to understand the limits of your insurance coverage.    It helps to give someone Health Care Power of Attorney (HCPOA).  If you're older than 18, and you expect your parents or a sibling to jump in if you become mentally disabled (say a coma), then you need to legally designate them as HCPOA.  Otherwise, the local doctors may overrule them and make you stay where you do not have insurance coverage.   If a person has HCPOA they can be your advocate and overrule the doctors.  The only automatic HCPOA-equivalent would be your spouse from a legally recognized marriage in the state where you're incapacitated.  That person needs to be in contact with your insurance company during your health crisis in order to make sure that your treatment is covered.  My policy only covers one state and I frequently travel out of state where I do dangerous things.  My brother has HCPOA and he has been instructed on the importance of evacuating me to my home state for continuing treatment should I have an accident out of state.  Now there is a wrinkle.  Let's say you go to FL for the winter and return to NH for the warm months.   You'll want to be able to go to the doctor for office treatment while you're in FL.  Your NH policy will not cover the office visit.  You can pay cash, or your can change your state of residency when you move to FL.  That move will be a 'qualifying event' that will allow you to enroll in a FL health insurance policy immediately (outside the normal once a year enrollment period).  Then when you come back to NH, you do the same thing.  Of course you will also have to change your driver's license and vehicle registration if you change your legal domicile.  I don't think that there is any limit on how frequently you can change your policy, but the cost of coverage varies from state to state.  It is surely a hassle to change your policy.  Another issue is federal premium subsidy and medicaid.  If you're living in a van, your income probably qualifies you for subsidy or medicaid in some states.  But in some red states your income may be too low to qualify for the federal subsidy and too high to qualify for medicaid (this is retarded anti-Obama nonsense).  Medicaid eligibility is set by each state.  Now the good news is that since you live in a van, you can easily move to a state that has expanded medicaid income levels.    If you want to get the subsidy (low premium) or medicaid (no premium), you will need to file an income tax form, even if you owe nothing.  So keep a record of all income including cash payments.  You can falsify cash payments if you need to catch up on your records... technically sketchy, but the IRS cares more about undeclared income, so just write something down in a notebook and then file the income tax form.  If the annual income is low enough, you will not have to pay tax, but you still need to file the tax return to get the subsidy.  If you're trying to figure out what works for you and explore 'what if' scenarios, contact healthcare.gov and talk to one of the nice people there.  Just tell them the truth and they will help you sort out your eligibility for the various states where you might establish your legal domicile.  You can call back multiple times and continue the conversation."
vandwellers,34aymq,vtjohnhurt,3,Thu Apr 30 02:18:43 2015 UTC,I've never read anything that in-depth about US healthcare. Makes me glad for the UK's NHS.  I'm guessing this all sounds as messed up to you as it does to me?
vandwellers,34aymq,kenbw2,2,Thu Apr 30 09:41:42 2015 UTC,"The current USA system is a cobbled together miscarriage of competing economic and political interests.  Bottom line is that Obamacare has greatly reduced the number of people who previously had NO health insurance... but at a very high price.  I'm clearly a big winner under Obamacare.  There are some losers.  Van dwellers were worse off under the old system, but the present system is extremely problematic for anyone who travels around a lot."
vandwellers,34aymq,vtjohnhurt,3,Thu Apr 30 15:04:36 2015 UTC,New around here and been wondering the same thing. Came across this site which had a nice article about health insurance for full-time RV'ers.   http://www.technomadia.com/2013/11/chapter-12-healthcare-and-staying-healthy-on-the-road-2/
vandwellers,34aymq,MegachiropsOnReddit,3,Thu Apr 30 04:18:56 2015 UTC,I suggest a summary of the contents of this conversation be added to the FAQ.  This is an important thread.  And we might want to cross check with any of the sailboating reddits where sailors have also tried to solve the issue of world wide health insurance coverage as they voyage around the globe.
vandwellers,34aymq,lsnckde,2,Thu Apr 30 06:56:34 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be:  Q. How do I get health insurance?  A. This is an incredibly complicated and confusing issue and it is therefore outside the scope of this FAQ.  Your best bet is to contact www.healthcare.gov and sort out your options with an adviser.  Some individual states have similar advice services.  Under the Affordable Care Act, if you make the effort, you can probably get a substantial premium subsidy, or qualify for Medicaid (in some states).   If you're over 65, you can be covered by Medicare, but the issue of supplementary health insurance policies may be problematic (contact AARP for advice).  If you're still named on your parent's policy (you are under age 26), the policy might limit coverage when you're outside the state in which your parents reside. Be sure to designate a Health Care Power of Attorney (This is probably a good idea even if you are legally married in the state in which you are parked)."

vandwellers,34aymq,ewcsear,2,Thu Apr 30 10:20:20 2015 UTC,"no longer have a residental fixed address?   The relevant legal concept is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domicile_%28law%29  Your domicile is usually the state that issues your driver's license and vehicle registration.  One of the more understandable (but still problematic) scenarios is when a college student maintains his legal domicile in his parent's home while he attends school full time in another state.  In the USA, he might remain on his parents' health insurance policy, but the insurance might not cover non-emergency treatment in the state where he goes to college."

Also, one advantage of staying in a truck stop vs. a Walmart parking lot or city street, is I can run the generator without worrying about bothering anyone.

vandwellers,34a4p4,svkb,7,Wed Apr 29 16:35:26 2015 UTC,I have spent many a nights at truck stops. It really depends on the area.  Sometimes lonely travelers can be targets for criminals. Oh and there is the extra bonus of potentially having a lot lizard bang on your door to see if you would like to purchase some extra company. Park in a well lit area. Other than that pretty cool.
vandwellers,34a4p4,gd2bpaid,7,Wed Apr 29 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"Truck driver here, spent many a night in truck stops.  Most TA's and Petro's have a ton of room, are clean and have good amenities (the restaurants can be quite good and decently priced).   Pilot truck stops are hit and miss, some are huge, some are little holes in the wall with only 10 parking spots, they tend to feel a bit more like an upjumped gas station, but if you've been in one Pilot you've basically been in them all.  Loves is generally a Pilot with a fresh coat of paint.  Flying J's tend to be huge, cleanliness varies but still usually pretty good. Can't comment on the restaurants because I never ate at a Flying J restaurant.  There are many smaller truck stops not affiliated with the major chains that can be pleasant places to stop, but naturally the quality varies widely.  The TA and Pilot in Gary Indiana are both shitholes (there are much better stops a few miles east on I-80/I-94), so are the two TA's east of LA on I-10.  If you are going to shower at a truck stop, make sure you have shower shoes.  And please do not park in a truck spot. There is nothing worse at the end of a 14-hour day than seeing an empty spot, lining up to back in, only to see a 4-wheeler parked in the back of it."

Growing up fairly close to the Saab factory (and therefor having a lot of Saab cars in my town) there was plenty of these Toppola campers on the streets.

vandwellers,3494yx,turdBouillon,4,Wed Apr 29 07:46:58 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts:  1) a van with 4x4 has it because the person needed 4x4. This also means that they likely had a plan for the van, and the interior/etc is 95% built, driving up cost and forcing you to either accept it or tear it all out.   2) As far as I know, no full size van came from the factory with a manual transmission. There are a few examples of people swapping one in, but there are reasons they didn't come with one from the factory. This only goes for the older traditional vans, the transit/sprinter/etc are packaged differently, and in other countries have a manual option.   3) Manual transmission and 4x4 take up more room, and in cases like the u-joint kit, you actually lose ~3 gallons. Adding more fuel capacity is going to either be a custom main tank, or relocating the spare and getting an aux tank. I haven't seen any kits/off the shelf options for either.   4) In my opinion, buy a van that has the mileage and cosmetic rating you are happy with. Everything else can be added on. If you are lucky, you can find a cheap (relative in this case) 4x4 Sportsmobile with pop top and aluminess bumper/winch, but ones like that come up maybe once a year.   4x4 conversions and pop tops are common enough to where you won't be  struggling in the dark. Same with front bumper/winch options. Aux fuel tank would be custom, but by no means unreasonable. Manual transmission though, I would cross it off your list."
vandwellers,3494yx,pillowpants80,2,Wed Apr 29 13:20:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to provide such an elaborate answer. That's exactly the confirmation that I was looking for. You seem extremely knowledgeable, what affect does adding something like 4x4 do to the resale price, is there any chance of breaking even or is it just something that if it's worth it to me I should expect to burn some money?"
vandwellers,3494yx,pillowpants80,2,Wed Apr 29 14:16:21 2015 UTC,"Almost anything you do to a vehicle is going to be at a loss, meaning if you take a $4k van and convert to 4x4 for $5k, you don't have a $9k van, more of a $5-6k. However you know that it was done right, all the bushings/bearings are new, and no shortcuts were taken.   I bought my van with the plan of converting it to 4x4 immediately, however due to jobs, that didn't happen. In the meantime though, it is still pulling its weight and doing everything I need it to. I still have big plans for it, but I am i no way unhappy with how it sits currently. Thats one of the good things about buying basic, you can upgrade it at your own pace, rather than the massive financial/stressful search for the perfect built vehicle."
vandwellers,3494yx,pillowpants80,2,Wed Apr 29 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"That's my current thinking as well, the only problem with doing it piecemeal like that is that due to physical access requirements for the conversions, I can't complete the interior until after the 4x4 and pop top kits are completed and those are my two biggest expenses.   I think I'll drop $10 - $15k on a great base van, then ASAP have the $6k pop top and $xx 4x4 kit done. Then I can finish up the interior and make other mods (solar, roof rack, wench, etc) as time goes on.    Thanks again for taking the time to thoughtfully reply."
vandwellers,3494yx,DazarGaidin,2,Wed Apr 29 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was ready to jump into mine with both feet, but family have been overly nice letting me regroup, which is bad because I'm not always motivated to work on the van.   I was able to pick up a '97 diesel E350 with 65k miles a couple years ago, I was glad that I got so lucky with it. I'm still trying to finalize my interior layout and get some of the pricier items ready to go, but I don't see any issues of doing a 4x4 conversion or a top (in my case a rigid fiberglass topper) after building up the interior. Off the top of my head the only interior change for 4x4 is the hole for t-case shifter betwen the front seats.   It sounds like you are where I was about 4-5 years ago. In my case I had the same job in 3-4 different states (my choice to relocate), and had the idea that I could set up camp anywhere with internet access Mon-Fri, and drive to a new location on the weekends. If they needed me at a datacenter for a while, wouldn't cost me or them a thing, and I woulnd't have to worry about wasting money on an empty apartment. It was also fun to see how far I could drive if my rent check went to fuel. There was another guy on expo that had a slide in camper in his pickup, and he would work out of campgrounds and national parks 9 months out of the year. A lot of things open up to you when you are homeless with means.   Whichever way you go, make sure you keep a good emergency vehicle fund just in case."

I didn't expect this post to get so many replies and of such high quality so my thinking on the matter has changed several times already this morning. It's a near certainty that 4WD is overkill for my needs. Currently I'm thinking that I'll revisit my dimensional needs and maybe shave a bit off the wheelbase if I can. Another poster pointed out that the Chevy Express line is AWD, and I found that Ford has a similar line of AWD vans. I think I should be able to meet my needs with AWD and the right tires. If I get ambitious later I can look into a slight lift-kit and a wench.    I want to do the pop-up style top to maximize stealth while adding a bit of comfort so I have to leave room for the scissor joists and stuff. Looking at a 4x4 conversion website they quoted for lost storage around the rear wheel wells, presumably to accommodate larger tires. At this point I'm backing away from all that. I should be able to get my hands on an AWD van ASAP and start framing it out and stuff while I use it as a commuter. I should have no prob getting the pop up installed and the thing finished up and insulated before winter.     Thanks yet again for the continued perspective. Best wishes, fellow dweller."

vandwellers,3494yx,DazarGaidin,2,Wed Apr 29 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"I think you will be spending way more money than you think..  ujoint doesn't list their I shop conversion cost on their site, but parts alone which they sell in kit form will cost you $8 to $10k   Then you are looking at a more money in wheels and tires..  The pop top set ups are another $10k  Then your manual trans which you say is $6 to 8k  You are talking $30 for just 3 options and not even buying the van or doing other work needed to get it up to shape, much less any sort of camper conversion..  Sure all this can be done cheaper, but only if you source all the parts yourself and do the work yourself.   None of this stuff is cheap hence the reason those guys with big shiny 4x4 vans always ask upwards of $40-60k or more if it's a nice one.. With all those options you want..  Meanwhile you can pick up a older well used Quigley for $10k on average.. No it's not gonna be as high end as a custom build but it won't cost either."
vandwellers,3494yx,crockett5,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't fully committed to doing it custom yet, I know that buying someone else's ex-dream-project is way more fiscally sound but I've got a very good income right now and I'd like to build out my third van just the way I've long wanted using what I learned in my last two builds and dwelling experience.    The pop top was actually $6-$8k. Per the excellent advice of PillowPants I've written off the manual trans as a nice-to-have that I'll almost certainly abandon.    Right now I'm thinking to pick up the right base van at $10-$15k then do the $6k pop top and ~$10k(?) for the 4x4 conversion. ~$30k + surprises. I can do the interior labor and appliance scavenging myself for very little and then get it on the road to make sure the depreciation rate is as impressive as possible.    Thanks for commenting."
vandwellers,3494yx,robshookphoto,2,Wed Apr 29 14:49:04 2015 UTC,"Well just to go a bit further, I understand the want to have a van like that, but how do you plan to use it?   The reason I ask, is because out side of the VW crowd and the Syncros I have really never seen many of these guys with these big 4x4 vans actually using them to the point they actually needed 4x4.   Most of those guys you see over on expo portal and their high dollar vans are what I tend to call Texas show trucks.. (you see a lot of these in Texas hence why I call them that) Just really big 4x4 trucks with a hell of a lot of money invested but they don't ever leave the pavement. This is the same with most of those fancy vans on expo..  If you truly want to go off roading in places that actually need 4wd, ie not random forest roads that a 2wd with a rear locker a bit of ground clearance & a winch would eat up all day long.. Then why not go with a 4wd truck & a nice pop top slide in?  I started out looking at the 4wd full size vans toyed with doing a conversion, the pop top and all that stuff. What I eventually realized was that those big ass vans with 4wd are really not that good off road. They are big, heavy and don't maneuver very well off road.  This is why out of all the 4wd van options out there, the only guys you really see pushing the vans and doing real trail rides are the Syncros and Toyota vans. The reason is because they are smaller and have the ability to maneuver off road on trails. (ie it's the same reason Jeeps are popular because they are small and can maneuver) A big 4x4 van will just get you stuck, because it's too big for real trail driving.  I personally ended up doing a syncro build which I'm half way through now.. However had I not come across the syncro I would have likely gone with a 4wd truck and camper build as it's a much better solution if you really do intend to go off road."

That leaves me commuting (sometimes several hours) in nightmare traffic or shoulder to shoulder on a packed train for months at a time waiting for my apt leases to wrap up. I tried one-bagging and living out of hotels but at tourist season hotels hit $300-$400 per night in the city. Thus my vandwell and my reluctance to use a topper. I want as much stealth as I can get with the options I really want so I can blend in near work.    At the moment I've found a gig out near Tahoe and can put that grind behind me, for now, but who knows what the future holds...    I've been thinking that for a long term thing I'd like to buy a ranch up in the Sierras and then commute to the central valley to do contract work. That would mean putting on chains or snow tires pretty frequently as required by law. I thought 4 wheel drive could make my commute easier while also giving me access to remote parts of the Mohave and other gorgeous natural areas near by.    So, I want some limited capabilities for less than ideal road conditions while maintaining adequate stealth to camp in San Francisco if that's what the future holds.  That said, taking into account your excellent advice I'm going to look into less than 4 wheel drive options. Maybe just posi-traction and the right tires will give me what I need. I'm not an off road enthusiast, just someone who hates putting on snow chains at 6am and would like to explore the far corners of the Western United States.    [A thought.... The options I initially listed are not at all uncommon on full size trucks. Is it feasable to buy a fully loaded F*50 truck for the chassis and drop an F*50 van body on top?]"

vandwellers,349em2,snommisnats,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"It depends on two things, the wiring in your van, and the wiring it is being plugged into. If the wiring in BOTH is 4 wire 220v, then it would most likely be safe to split 110v off of either side of the 220v circuit. The problem comes when the 220v plug or socket (typically a NEMA 14-50 at RV parks) is incorrectly wired with only 3 wires usually leaving off the common, or neutral wire. Connecting to one leg of the 220v circuit can then unbalance the circuit, often throwing the breaker.  If both sides (wall and van) are wired correctly with a 4 wire circuit, then pulling from either leg for a 110v circuit is safe and meets current National Electric Code."
vandwellers,349em2,macmccune2,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"I am more confused by your post than the one from OP.  Why would the previous owner of the van wire it for 220? It is an e150, not an rv with appliances.  Without pictures it is impossible to guess, but I was assuming the van is wired with two 110v receptacles, which connect to (hopefully) some sort of breaker panel, then from there to a cord wired for 15 amp outlets.  I suppose it is possible that the van has a 14-50 plug, but I cannot imagine anyone feeling they need that much in a DIY converted van. A 30 amp plug (tt-30) would be more likely, but I have a feeling that the person wiring the van would be more likely to choose the most common plug."
vandwellers,349em2,snommisnats,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"I've seen both types in home built vans... but seeing the picture now, it is likely either a tt-30 or a standard plug in."
vandwellers,349em2,macmccune2,1 point,Fri May 1 02:39:56 2015 UTC,Pretty sure there just 2 110v outlets. I posted a pic and some more info in another comment if you want to check it out. Thanks.
vandwellers,349em2,macmccune2,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:56:16 2015 UTC,"The post is a little confusing. If you fed your inverter into the outlets currently connected to the shore power plug, you would have to disconnect your inverter whenever you use shore power or vice versa. It makes me nervous to have them connected at all.  Do you use the shore power plug?   You could always try an extension cord or surge protector to make it easier to reach the inverter. Essentially this is what you would be doing, extending the outlet from the inverter to the receptacles in the wall.   Edit: I might have misunderstood the post. The way it is wired now, is it basically an extension cord that comes out of the van? If you plugged that into the inverter, you would have power to those 2 outlets without connecting to shore power.   For some reason I read it as; you want to wire the inverter into the shore power outlets physically, as in splicing wires together and making a giant fire hazard. Dont do this. I have never fed 120v into an inverter, but I cant imagine it would end well.   Pictures would help, but I have a feeling most of the important wiring is out of view without ripping apart the walls."
vandwellers,349em2,Sehc,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:45:09 2015 UTC,Hey here's a pic of the setup. I don't use shore power and it's completely independent of the system. The shore plug is actually a female outlet so I'm just curious if I can take an extension cord and link up the inverter into the shore power so that it feeds the more convenient 110v outlet that's in the van...
vandwellers,349em2,cookieguy10,2,Thu Apr 30 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"Alright that helps a lot. You should be fine running an extension cord from the inverter to that grey box, preferably the shortest cord that will reach. I say should because that looks like a mess. Good thing is those are GFCI outlets, and the 12v wiring has fuses (they are glass tube fuses, not used since ~1980, but they work the same) so it appears the previous owner knew what he was doing. That being said, if you haven't tested them before follow the wires, make sure they arent pinched anywhere or otherwise frayed or damaged. Chances are you would blow the fuse in your inverter or trip those breakers in the outlets before starting a fire, but better safe than sorry."
vandwellers,347tsm,cliffdweller67,6,Wed Apr 29 00:04:44 2015 UTC,"Install a curtain rod or shower rod behind the front seats and then go to walmart and buy some of their cheap black out curtains (they are like $7 bucks each). If you get a color like dark brown or something similar you wont even see them from outside unless you get right up to the van and look in the window. It will just appear dark inside from the casual walker by.  On my own van, I build a wood partition behind each of the front seats and then use a curtain between the doorway. But using a curtain all the way across works just fine.  For the rear windows, tint them limo black so they block the view during the day and then make some inserts for at night out of that silver bubble-wrap insulation you can buy at lowes or home depot.   This will blow view into the van at night, but can also be used during the heat of the day to keep heat from entering the van if you are in direct sunlight. It also helps insulate the windows in the winter.  You are looking at maybe $20-25 for the front seat curtains and rod, then maybe $30 for a roll of the silver bubble insulation.  Tinting the rear windows the price will vary.."
vandwellers,347tsm,crockett5,2,Wed Apr 29 00:52:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for such a descriptive response. I really like the bubble wrap idea. I never would have thought of that. The wooden partition is a novel idea and I would employ that with the help of someone who can make that happen for me. Its good to know I can fashion a fabric that doesn't look obvious. Things are looking up!
vandwellers,347tsm,Wildernasty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:20:32 2015 UTC,"The silver bubble wrap is called reflectix. I have cutouts for all of my windows behind the front seats. I hung them up with little strips of Velcro so they are easy to put up and take down. I have curtains that slide on factory rails that cover the reflectix. I haven't put it on yet, but I picked up a roll of window tint that I will put on the back windows so you can't see the reflectix from the outside, otherwise it gives off that ""lived in"" vibe from your van."
vandwellers,347tsm,batshitcrazy69,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"What this guy did. I did the same thing behind my seats but used a clothing rod designed to go in a car to hang my material by. They can be found in most places that sell car accessories and have nice hooks already a part of it which makes hanging it easy. Just like he said, when looking in casually at night it just looks dark inside.  Another idea would be to put in a metal frame with a door behind the seats. This makes it look more like a professional work van.  For side windows, maybe a really dark tinting would work. But make sure it is dark enough that someone can't see in when shining a flashlight from the outside, because it's likely cops will shine a light inside the windows. (They have with me) Maybe tinting combined with curtains would work. The tinting would make the curtains less obvious."
vandwellers,347tsm,batshitcrazy69,4,Wed Apr 29 10:20:54 2015 UTC,"Take pictures of the interiors of the van, blow up the pictures and tape the pictures on the inside of the windows. That way if anyone looks in, it will just look like a ordinary van on the inside."

But not this small: http://i.imgur.com/aagwOQk.jpg  Want to get some discussion on small trucks Vs vans and see what people think.  Advantages of vans:  -Cheaper to buy  -Smoother to drive on bumpy roads  -Access to cab from back part (might be possible in truck?)  -Already has windows in it  Advantages of small chiller truck  -Excellent thermal insulation, warmer in winter  -Easy to cut and modify the poly-sandwich material  -Square shape is easy to fit furniture into  -Not identified as a camper unless it has big obvious windows  -Doesn't appear out of place in a parking lot overnight  -Can put a furniture removals logo on the side for extra stealth  -Can carry more weight  -Roofspace for a lot of solar panels  -Can fit a small chiller unit above the cab to cool it in summer"
vandwellers,345387,redditorwhoknocks,14,Tue Apr 28 11:07:21 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea if you can afford one. I used to work with a small Fuso Box truck with a thermo king reefer on it. The reefer was very efficient and would only use a gallon of diesel every ten hours.  The one problem with the boxes is that the usually have a sealed vapor barrier which to lots of mold buildup behind the wall panels. If you buy one you would definitely want to renovate the box.   The problem you're going to have is finding one that is not totally trashed out for a low price. These trucks are usually run until they are about to fall apart. Finding one in good condition won't be hard, but it will not be cheap."

We're completely un-handy-manny and realized very quickly that we were way out of our league when we visited my brother in CA who IS a handy-manny. He's actually a finish carpenter in Orange County, doing stunning work for lots of money, so maybe it wasn't a fair comparison, but I admitted defeat.   And I really wanted a dog. My life was incomplete without a fuzzy friend and it felt unfair to keep a dog and two adults in a van. If it was just one adult and the dog, okay maybe. Just two adults? Sure. But the addition of a third body was claustrophobic. To test the theory, we went camping a few times in the van with the dog. It wasn't awful, but I could see it getting very tiresome."

vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,2,Mon Apr 27 19:17:15 2015 UTC,Hell yea thanks man! I'm running a engel sb70f 12v fridge and it's been totally fine. I run it at its mid setting which is cold enough to make ice cubes for the whiskey. I've only seen my yeti drop to 80% after a few days of rain and no sun. Once the sun is out she charges right back up. Good luck with the rig!
vandwellers,340zu5,charlietakethetrench,2,Mon Apr 27 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"that's really impressive! I thought for sure I'd have to go with a propane fridge or a hybrid system of some kind. the super efficient powered coolers are just way too expensive at $1000+ a pop. as for the GZ, it's apparently super easy to expand to up to 170AH more by hooking up another battery to the powerpole connector on the back, probably what I'd do since I want to run a playstation for downtime and do photo editing. keep on livin the dream!"
vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:29:31 2015 UTC,That sounds like a good way to go - you can also run an extension cable and bum power off whatever outlets you can find :) The fridge I picked up was about $650.

vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,1 point,Tue Apr 28 10:44:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say get as few panels as possible (less things to break and worry about) and make the wiring easily accessible in case something does go wrong and/or you want to add to your system. The z brackets I used are great for mounting the panels but are a bit difficult to remove, which could be problematic if one of the panels needs some fixing. As for toilet, I'm looking to invest in a luxurious bucket, but at the moment have a trowel."
vandwellers,340zu5,freakame,2,Tue Apr 28 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"Good advice.  I've yet to fit ours with solar, so trying to decide how to run that.  Currently land power only.    You know, you could get a nice platform for the back hitch and get a little outdoor toilet/shower action going on.... we have a front hitch with a cage on ours and it's perfect for loading on stuff that can be out in the weather. Back hitch is for bikes/scooter."
vandwellers,340zu5,almondgarfield,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:07:45 2015 UTC,Super insperational.    I just got a 2005 econoline 250 going to build something similar in. How are you powering the fridge? Is the goal zero setup enough? I was looking at an Engel  fridge and I'll need 200w of solaR.    anyone have a recommendation for a battery isolator?
vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:11:40 2015 UTC,Sick! I've got the engel sb70f which has been pretty awesome. The goal zero setup is sufficient - I don't know the exact input on average (and it totally depends on weather) but it appears to stay around 60w while the sun is up (80-90 at best). The fridge runs much less than 30w on average with the mid-setting.

vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,2,Mon Apr 27 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"Right on thanks! To answer your questions: I've been working in tech for the past few years and realized how unfulfilling it was for me. I love rock climbing and the outdoors so I've decided to switch things up and promised myself to pursue the things I love, even if they aren't the most lucrative or secure. Fortunately my previous jobs let me save some decent money, and at the moment I've been picking up the occasional freelance gig on the side. Regarding gas, yea she doesn't have the best gas mileage (15-17mpg). You could look into diesel or sprinters (i hear they get in the 20mpg range), but they're a bit pricier. I'm picking up a bike and throwing on a rack so that'll save me some local driving at least. Good luck figuring out your future rig! Hit me up if you need anymore info."

vandwellers,340zu5,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"Very nicely done.  The aromatic cedar is very appealing but use caution, some people develop sensitivity to the aromatic cedar oil over time and it causes respiratory problems. Your excellent ventilation may reduce that factor.  I would stay away from cedar in a cold climate with minimal ventilation."
vandwellers,340zu5,bubbabessie,2,Tue Apr 28 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"Right on thanks for that. It makes sense for anything ""aromatic"" to have those risks. I've been sleeping with the fan going - definitely will keep this in mind. I appreciate the tip!"
vandwellers,340zu5,vtjohnhurt,2,Tue Apr 28 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know about cedar in particular, but many chemical sensitivities develop abruptly.  For example, people get epoxy on their skin for years with no problem, and then suddenly one day they get extremely bad dermatitis.  After that the least exposure provokes an extreme reaction from the immune system, the hypersensitivity never goes away.   If the cedar starts to bother you gradually, you might be able to give it a coat of varnish to slow down the cedar oil dispersal.  And of course the intensity of the cedar smell will diminish with time.  If you let the van get hot in the sun, the oil will disperse more rapidly.  The cedar is really pretty and the absence of knots makes it an appealing material, but it's a gamble in a habitable van."

If you take your topper and put in square walls you will get the angled space he has on sides for cabinetry, just add dividers (contoured to shell, make template with cardboard) and doors.     Get yourself a kreg jig and you can probably do it all pretty easy.  Check this video series out, the concept is the same just on a smaller scale."

If it is diesel then thats not bad mileage but have a mechanic go over it.  Diesel are expensive to repair.

vandwellers,343388,SkylarThomas,2,Tue Apr 28 20:28:12 2015 UTC,"200k on that Ford diesel is MUCH better than 160k on a gas engine. I personally think that engine is one of the best Ford ever offered in any vehicle (ironically not actually a Ford engine though). If I was looking for that much space, that's the one I would look at. You're paying for the engine and the high top. On the other hand, I would say the best deal is the 95 Dodge with the solar panels for $1900, depending on the damage from the deer hit. You almost can't go wrong at that price, assuming it runs and drives OK. You'd have to put a little money into it, but the solar panels are worth at least $300 and everything including batteries is already mounted for you. A close second might be the 94 Chevy. I've never been a fan of conversion vans unless you gut them and start over. The beds are uncomfortable and badly sized (I'm 6'5""), and the space is very inefficient. The only selling point is the high top."

We were thinking on buying a brand new gas guzzler and go up north, but don't have the funds for a brand new. That used EV is 9k and it seems like a step up from a gas engine. At least we don't have to pay for fuel plus we can charge electronics from the car while at a charging station instead of having to step inside the same restaurant over and over and battle for the single plug... or one or three plugs at a library. Plus... free AC.... I know the EV is tiny, but I want to consider the EV my bed and the trailer my storage room while the outside world is my home! Besides the EV is a step toward an EV van. Save up the gas for a 3 years and then pick up that Nissan E-NV200 when it comes out. 250/month gas * 36= 9k gas plus regular savings and selling the used EV at the end. I'd be able to take out the Nissan e-nv200 with a good down payment or maybe even pay it in full...."

Big oil has deep pockets and a lot of politicians in their pockets too.  I've seen charging stations charging $10/hr too, so that is also probably the wave of the future.

I was told the DC lv3 chargers cost $5 bucks for 80% charge in 30 minutes. were the $10 stations DC lv3 by any chance?  I was told you could get veg oil from a store that throws it out at night and install a tank with a heating element and a special filter.... Was that the oil you were talking about?

Then maybe 2 years ago he switched it back to regular diesel because he said he couldn't get the veggie oil reliably any more because big money was buying it all up.  Maybe little places out in the sticks might still have it for free, but the quantity may be too low to make it sensible.  I suspect some of the bigger outfits are using it in the production of bio diesel or something."

Mine will 730 cold cranks and give 100 amp hours. You will have to drive to keep it charged A dashboard solar panel can give you about 16w and will charge your phone. You can get battery chargers that have USB connection so that you can charge AAs right off the panel. Another solution some people do is use a battery jump starter pack. With that one you need to be able to charge for a couple days.   Another thing I have done is changed over to a large screen smart phone (Note 3) and gotten rid of the laptop/desktop. With a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, my phone works very well as a ""computer"" and uses way less power. You could even buy a couple extra phone batteries and swap them in as needed so you'll always have your phone working.

But it would make a lot of noise and not be a good option when I'm in popukated areas.

With just a phone, some lights, and computer, you might be able to get away with an 80 dollar marine battery from wal mart wired into your engines charging system. For this to work you need to drive daily to recharge what you used the night before.  Another option is a generator, can be found on craigslist for under 150 dollars. Keep in mind you will need to find somewhere you can run it without bothering people. The only time you must have a generator is if you plan to run large appliances in your van. Things like air conditioning, blenders, and power tools. If you do not plan to use things like that, it is probably best to try to avoid a generator. They take up a ton of space in a van.  Another popular option is solar panels. This is going to be the most expensive from the beginning, but that doesnt mean you cant work around a budget. The best part of solar is the free energy, that is silent. You will need a battery bank, a solar panel and a charge controller.  http://www.amazon.com/Renogy-100W-Mono-Starter-Kit/dp/B00BFCNFRM That is a good starting point, you can always add more 100w panels if you need it.   Here are a few articles on electricity in a van, which might be helpful:  http://www.cheaprvliving.com/electrical/electricity/  http://www.cheaprvliving.com/blog/baby-steps-electricity-car-van-little-money/  The whole website is a great source of valuable information to anyone considering this lifestyle.  I cant imagine living in a van with 6 people and pets. I bet it feels like a mansion with all the extra space."

vandwellers,33w4s4,svkb,2,Sun Apr 26 15:41:13 2015 UTC,A lot of those government vans run on CNG.  The reason some of them are so cheap is because the tanks are expired and it costs around $8K to replace them - way more than the van is worth at that point.   I would be VERY leery of buying a van off a site like govdeals.  There's usually very little information available and even if you're local by some chance they probably won't show it to you before the auction.
vandwellers,33w4s4,Circlejerk_Level_900,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"The issue with government vehicles are they are driven by people who know they are getting a new vehicle in 5 years and who don't own it so most are driven hard. That being said, hard is not necessarily destructive. Most have followed the manufacture's maintenance schedule (because tax payers pay for oil changes and tire rotations etc.) But some are cycled out before their time because the mechanics can't fix ""That squeaking when I turn left"" or shock problems, or there was a fender bender and no one wants to deal with it so just put in a requisition to get a new one.  I can almost promise you that you will not find one treated with TLC but if you are gutting it anyway and making a living space. All you really care about is the shell (is it weather proof), engine, tires, and price. For those things, and those only I think you will find very cheap prices."

One parent died when I was young and left me some money, the other I feel no connection to.  I have a few very close friends and family but they've got their own lives and as much as I love them I don't love where they live and there isn't really anything else for me there besides them.  I'm in my late twenties, single, jobless, and have nothing to tie me down.  Whenever I stay in one place I tend to get into bad habits... drinking, not eating, not sleeping, etc.  I become like a depressed, nervous, anxious rat in a cage.  When I travel I'm fit as a fiddle, constantly meeting people, my child-like sense of awe, wonder, and adventure gets rekindled... I'm like a different person.  Thus I've realized my options at this point in life are pretty much:  a) live on the road until I find someplace/someone worth settling down in/for, or  b) drink myself into an early grave  Option A is more appealing."

People at campgrounds are usually on vacation and therefore pretty talkative, one thing leads to another and you've made a connection, they know somebody, etc. Bars are pretty great.  I don't drink much but I almost always end up talking to somebody. If you're into sports, swing by a park and join a pickup basketball game or something similar.  Or start chatting people up at the gym/pool/etc.   It also depends on whether you're staying in one place for a while or moving around rapidly.  Paradoxically, I find that the more I move around the more connections I seem to make, whereas if I'm in one place I tend to keep to myself more.  So I plan to move around as much as possible."

Too many people (Yuck) and I cannot afford to rent an apartment (I don't make 3 times the rent which is required) so I rent rooms. It's proven to be very undesirable to me as many are lacking in manners and good graces for living and I'm not good with everyone just doing their thing, plus I tend to like quiet. I am middle-aged, and while I am young at heart I like people to act respectful. Since this seems to allude many humans, and I got pretty sick of seeking out yet another room so I am opting to live in a van. I also went back to school and acquired a hefty loan so I would like to pay that back as quickly as possible. I plan on applying for grad school at years end so this will help with that. Van living will afford me to save money and allow me the freedom I desire. I am a social person to an extent, but am also a loner so cozying up in a van appeals to me. I have a full-time job so with the costs it will be less than what I have been paying for a room and I will have the easy of money to make it full of comfort. I also can purchase some things I have been wanting to acquire for outdoor enjoyment. There's something about working and struggling and getting nowhere. I loath helping others get rich while I spin my wheels. I am not motivated by money as success. I guess in a way van living feels like it might be my tribe.

vandwellers,33urhw,SpartanMonkey,2,Mon Apr 27 01:21:57 2015 UTC,"Houses have a lot more room to add enough insulation so it can last through a whole day or night than a van does.  Losing 6-12"" on all sides, top, and bottom of a house is no big deal. Not so true in a van."
vandwellers,33urhw,jackspaniels,3,Mon Apr 27 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Any amount of insulation is better than no insulation. No matter the thickness, you will notice a measurable difference. I have seen this for myself."
vandwellers,33urhw,SpartanMonkey,2,Mon Apr 27 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"I guess some people have different experiences.  I went from a heavily insulated low top 2003 Chevy Express 2500 cargo van with 2 fantastic roof vents, to a 87 Dodge 3500 Maxi-Wagon extended length, plus an uninsulated fiberglass high top.  It's a window van with no added insulation at all, and no roof vents, and it is much easier to heat or cool than the cargo van was.  This high top has to have nearly twice the air volume, but takes about half the time to heat up to comfortable.  Cooling went from nearly impossible to almost instantaneous."

All home built campers varying from a pad on the floor to a fold up sleeper. I am building a window van this time for the reasons you give. Sitting in a room with a view. I have upgraded the wall insulation, but like the window and other trim on the passenger van. If the windows don't work out, it is easier to block them than to instal windows in a cargo van."

vandwellers,33urhw,SpartanMonkey,4,Sun Apr 26 08:39:22 2015 UTC,"Having switched from a cargo van to a window van, I haven't found one single negative to window vans.  Way fewer cop problems, so far no break ins, way easier to cool, no harder to heat, you get a view, and possibly most importantly people treat you better.  In cargo vans people think your homeless, and treat you like your homeless, the cops treat you like your a criminal, the thieves like to break in hoping for tools or whatever else they can steal, and you have to spend a fortune to make it livable only to wind with something worse than if you started with a window van.  I can't speak for anyone else, but for me living in a house with either no windows or very few windows just plain sux.  Cave dwelling went bye bye with the cave men because they figured out that houses with lots of opening windows were preferable.  Since I switched to a window van I haven't spent a single night in fear because I can see what's happening around me.  The exact opposite of when I had a cargo van and couldn't see out good.  I'd hear something I couldn't see then lay awake in fear of what was coming next.  Or wake up and find graffiti on my van or gang symbols.  Since I switched to a window van I haven't had my gas stolen a single time, in my cargo van that was another regular occurrance, and gas ain't cheap!  My pretty white cargo van went from beautiful to ugly primer gray because I couldn't remove the graffiti all the way and couldn't afford a whole new paint job several times a year.  My cargo van had 2-4"" of insulation all the way around and 2 roof vents.  In the summer it was too hot to be stand from noon to 3-4am, never a problem with lots of opening windows.  In the winter it required the heat to run at least double what my unmodified window van does because the windows act like heaters when their closed and the sun is out, from 10am to sundown no extra heat needed, and this window van has a high top so it's also a much larger volume of air to heat or cool too, but still way easier than my cargo van was, and I don't have or need roof vents any more either.  No more waking up in the middle of the night drenched because it decided to rain or crawling into a drowned van after a long day at work.  Those stupid rain sensors can't be trusted.  I did get rain proof vent covers later, and that did help, but it also limited where I could take the van because of the height of them.  No more parking garages or fast food drive thru's.  It did teach me that I could live without those, and so a high top van would work though too, so I guess it was another lesson learned.    Nope, I've had both, and I'll never own another cargo van.  On the road I've met a lot of other vandwellers, and most who had cargo vans switched to window vans, and would never go back.  Old, cheap, high top window vans are also much easier to find than old, cheap, high top cargo vans are.  My cargo van was a low top, and having a high top makes all the difference in the world for livability.  Old cheap vans also make a lot better sense than newer $10k+ vans do, because their cheaper to replace.  During the time I had my cargo van I lost $6k in depreciation, and another $5k in interest, and another $7k+ for the interior!  One expensive lesson.  Talk about stuff they should have taught us in school and didn't, but I was broke with no job and had no choice but to finance one.  I didn't have anybody to teach me better ways.  The others I have met on the road have since taught me better. I have $0 in this van, under $500 in the interior, and it's a 100x better home.  If I had the ability to start over, I'd skip college, cargo vans and all the extra crap involved in making them livable, and going into debt.  I wouldn't skip travelling while working because it's a great way to see the country.  I've learned one hell of a lot more on the road than I ever learned from books, school, college, or the internet.  The internet was directly responsible for getting me stuck with a cargo van and charging big $$$ on credit to outfit it.  Solar panels, insulation, expensive roof vents, expensive everything.  I was young and dumb and fell for it, but now I am older and smarter and have paid big $$$ for my mistakes but I've learned the hard way from them.  I learned the hard way how stupid it was to put big $$$ into a cargo van, or any van, to make it into a camper.  I learned that having lots of opening windows works a whole lot better than insulation or roof vents.  I learned that a high top you can stand up in is a whole lot better than a low top, and the longer the better too.  I learned that gym memberships and public bathrooms suck, and it's better to have your own.  I  learned that foam beds are better than air beds, and having a bed you don't have to set up or down every day is better.  I learned you better be prepared to spend days inside your van without leaving for one reason or another.  This may sound stupid, but it took me a while to figure it out, I learned to park in the shade in the summer and the sun in the winter.  That works better than insulation every time.  Learning how to park to take advantage of the daylight and weather is really huge.  If I need to be up early to go to work, I park to get sun in my eyes early, if I want to sleep in, I park to be in the shade.  Learning how and where to park is a big one, it's free, and it's a lot more effective than insulation.  Sorry for the long post but you asked for reasons, so I wanted to give you a few.  These are just a very small sample, but should be enough to get a decent discussion started.  I still see all of the crap on the internet about converting cargo vans that led me down a wrong and costly path, and maybe speaking up can save other people from making the same mistakes.  I wish someone would have warned me, but they were all too busy taking my money and giving me advice on how to spend even more money.  Everybodys all smiles when you're spending money, but when you get done, you're a bum living in a cargo van. But its too late by the time reality kicks you in the ass."

That being said, having the attitude of not wanting to get burned is natural. No one does- but it does happen to the best of mechanics even.   The best thing you can do is find a competent mechanic (ma and pa/independent type garage- no chain store or dealers) and make friends with him. I've been working on cars for 20+ years and I always go out of my way to take care of my regulars.   Find a mechanic and have him go over any vehicle BEFORE you buy it. If the seller has any issues with this, they are more than likely trying to hide something.  THAT being said, work vans can be had for a great deal- but there will usually be one major thing that needs attention- brakes, trans, oil leak, etc. This is often why they are good deals. Don't fear- often the value of the van is still more than the cost of the repairs plus the van. The higher the miles- the more stuff can go wrong, in general. But either of those should make it to to 200K no problems, a few issues aside. EVERY used is going to have issues. But not to say they are not worth pursuing- once the problem is resolved, they are like brand new, usually.  edit: The first one is 1/2 ton, the second is 3/4 ton. Unless you plan on hauling a trailer, I'd go for the first one most def."
vandwellers,33sx9p,macmccune2,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. A friend recommended me a good local mechanic. I'm trying to avoid buying a van that will force me to put thousands of dollars into it immediately to keep it running, which seems a somewhat likely scenario for old vans in this price range.  The other thing I'm worried about is ventilation, which seems to be kind of a contentious point. I keep reading that window vans lend themselves better to temperature control than cargo vans, even with roof vents/fans installed...still not sure what to make of all that."

vandwellers,33pnvm,ImReallyHighBut,2,Sat Apr 25 02:44:34 2015 UTC,Look into day labor operations such as labor ready and manpower to get yourself some money.  Many times you can be hired on for more than a day and this will allow you to bank some travel money and experience interesting jobs.    County and church food banks can really save you in a pinch but can also help you get a solid start.    Wandering is nice but you can play your odds and do some research on jobs ahead of time.  Look into things such as workamping and woofing though I say fuck the woofers.

vandwellers,33oe2u,urbanvandweller,4,Fri Apr 24 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"I have worked for State Farm Insurance for the last 5 years, I thought I would weigh in here. You will need to have the vehicle registered in whatever state you wish to insure it in. This generally means having established residency and sometimes having a drivers license from that State. Each state has different rules regarding residency but insurance works in tandem with the DMV/BMV. You will need to have the vehicle registered in the same state in order for the DMV/BMV to recieve proof of insurance and not suspend your registration after about a month.  There is nothing illegal about maintaining residency in one state and travelling through another. Many people own homes in multiple states or travel year-round for work. These people have a home state where they claim residency and pay taxes.  If you were living permanently in another state, renting a home, or if you owned one, you might run into residency issues due to property taxes and such but living out of a vehicle, means you are ultimately always travelling, even when you aren't going anywhere.  Here is a link to the instructions for becoming a Maine resident: http://www.maine.gov/portal/family/moving.html  Hope this helps, let me know if you have any other insurance related questions. :)"

vandwellers,33oe2u,Italian_Not_Jewish,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"HI! I'm actually in the military with the dream of Vandwelling(which is why I just bought a hatchback), but I figured my two cents would be better than the zero you've received thus far. Plus I'm from PA, how fun! Let me say now that I'm not well-versed in auto insurance. I'm pretty much just here to fill the gap and give you something to think about(which you've probably already thought about) until someone with real advice shows up.   Now I've moved around a little bit, but PA allows me to keep my residence, license, and vehicle registration there because of my job. USAA won't allow me to insure my car in PA because they know I don't live there; however, State Farm allows me to insure it in another state than where I actually live(it's no secret, they know full and well where).    My first point is that it could vary by company, and my second point is you might actually need an address(or license with an address) from the state you want your vehicle to be insured it. Also, where would you be registering the vehicle? Will the company actually allow you to insure in one state if it's registered in another?   Finally, if you're moving around I believe you could easily explain that you're out of the state to travel. I see no reason why you'd have to provide an alibi as to why you weren't in the state where you're registered. You're not on house arrest(I assume) and plainly, shit happens, and not always where or when you'd prefer it to happen."

vandwellers,33oe2u,realy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's illegal, but if you try to make a claim the insurance can refuse to pay because you falsified information to obtain the policy. I lived in hotels for several years with no permanent address and what I do know is the address you give to your insurance company has to be the same one on your driver's license and vehicle registration.  You can rent a mail box at a local UPS store and use that to get a local drivers license (don't get a PO Box, UPS Stores can give you a regular street address).  Honestly, though, the costs driving to Main, renting a mail box, getting a new license and registering your car there is probably more than  you'll save on insurance."
vandwellers,33oi3w,-IAmEvil,11,Fri Apr 24 05:04:38 2015 UTC,"I believe a conversion van is more stealthy, because they blend in.  Stealth is a bit of a misnomer, you are looking more for camouflage.   As for police, if you stick around  more than a night or two, they will know youre in there.  Trust me, police are not dumb and they patrol their area daily, so they will notice a van they cant see into parked there.  At best you are trying to fool the casuals who might complain to the cops and make them actually act on it.  My second cop knock was when i was in a park n ride (ive stayed at a lot during day, when it was full).  I was sick and slept on weekend, and all the cars parked around me were gone.  So there i was, this sore thumb sticking out in a parking lot.  I decided to let them have a look inside to satisfy their curiosity that im not a meth maker, and have not been bothered since.  Cop told me later this is intentional on their part, since i was cooperative,  But im stationary for work."
vandwellers,33oi3w,DazarGaidin,2,Fri Apr 24 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"The only real police encounter I've had was when I fell asleep in a park and it closed. Woke up to bright lights and way too many vehicles (marked and unmarked). I knew I was wrong so was like fine, have a look. But I made them promise not to tear all my stuff out as I've heard some cops do. I had a camera rolling but it quickly ran out of memory. Noob mistake. It wasn't a big deal but they did get me outside and one immediately started badgering me about having a ""cage"" in my van. I kept asking what he meant but he'd just move to a different set of questions. Turns out he was referring to the cab partition. The ""good cop"" complimented my build when they left. Said it was nicer than his travel trailer.   trying to fool the casuals   I don't think of it like that. But if they're fooled, that's fine with me. If they're not, I wouldn't know. Same city for over 6 months and no one seems to care. And yes, I get that cops know what's up when I stick around. I just want my cargo van to pass for normal enough for the busybodies or whoever it is that feels compelled to make calls.  Stealth means ""cautious and surreptitious action or movement."" In whatever van a vandweller dwells, I believe the term can apply. I don't have experience with conversion types, so I won't chime in on this vs. that but I like the discussion!"
vandwellers,33oi3w,pseudo_mccoy,3,Sat Apr 25 01:57:45 2015 UTC,"It entirely depends on location and the difference is small anyway.

vandwellers,33oi3w,chaifilms,2,Sat Apr 25 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"I think another great thing about a work van is the sheer amount of space it offers to build yourself a great living area. It's a big empty box of bare metal and you can add as much or as little to it as you please. A conversion limits you somewhat, since wall space is taken up by windows and insulating is made more difficult, if not impossible."

vandwellers,33nrhk,xinaked,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:11:56 2015 UTC,"I parked in a free parking lot overlooking lake mead near Las Vegas. There's hiking from the parking lot, there's a long one where you can walk to the Hoover dam, also some shorter that lead in a circle back to your vehicle. The lot is on the right before getting to paid parking for the lake. It's also a pretty big lot with RV size spots."
vandwellers,33nl22,voidqk,3,Thu Apr 23 23:55:06 2015 UTC,You will need an inverter with the mini fridge where the dometic will run straight 12 volt.   I have a dometic 40l cooler. They are build for being in vehicles. Lots of vibration can damage mini fridges over time. Dometics are also extremely well insulated and do not run a whole to lot to keep their temperature set.   The mini fridge will work fine if you are gonna be parked a lot. The dometic is build more towards expedition vehicles and vehicles that see a lot of miles.
vandwellers,33nl22,redditorwhoknocks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:13:57 2015 UTC,"Just so you'll know (if you don't already), Dometic and Norcold also make refrigerators that are 2 way (propane and 120v AC) and 3 way (propane, 120v AC, and 12v DC). It's my understanding that the 12v DC fridges are primarily used while the vehicle is in operation, because they would quickly drain a battery that's not being constantly charged. redditorwhoknocks is correct that the Dometics are more durable than the mini fridges. I've had a 2 way in my Airstream that has been in constant operation (except for defrosting) for over 10 years, and well over 100,000 miles."
vandwellers,33nl22,Deranger1,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:49:24 2015 UTC,The Dometic is 12v so 45w/12v = 3.75 amps  Meanwhile the mini fridge will require an inverter to operate and is not very efficient as a fridge. The Dometic will use much less power.
vandwellers,33nl22,crockett5,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"I checked the power consumption of the mini-fridge, and it only consumes 35 watts when running. The Dometic consumes 45 watts.   Refrigerators cycle on and off depending on the temperature of the room, the temp of what you put in it etc.. The watt power draw only tells you the power draw when it is on.  You need to multiply the watts times the hours running to get watt/hours to understand how how much each unit will draw down your battery.  The total battery drain will depend on the efficiency of the cooling mechanism (compressor/thermocouple), the insulation value of the box, the air tightness of the seals etc..  It is impossible to compare these units with the information that you've provided."
vandwellers,33nl22,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"Did you actually hook up a killowatt meter to the mini fridge to get that wattage?  I had a mini fridge that supposedly was 60 watts (i think they do some sort of average wattage best case scenario estimation..), but on compressor start up it would spike to 500 watts for a few seconds, then drop to 300, then slowly drop on down to 90-70watts and hang there while it ran.  This was on the energy saver setting.   It ran a lot more than i expected.  I ended up putting it on a timer and cutting the power to it, only allowing it to run at specific times to help my poor batteries.  In the end i still think it hurt them, 2 years later my batteries have lost quite a bit of capacity.  When that thing kicked on, my inverter would squeal like a piggy for a second or two due to low voltage."
vandwellers,33nl22,DazarGaidin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 05:05:30 2015 UTC,"I did -- but I may have remembered incorrectly!  I just tested it again, and it's reporting 77 watts!  I could have sworn it was at 35 watts... but the fridge has gone unused (room temperature) for a few weeks, so I'm not sure if it is just consuming a lot to cool it down initially.  I will test again once it stabilizes."
vandwellers,33nl22,jackspaniels,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"Nevermind... it's peaking at 100 watts, then dropping down to 75 watts, every time it cycles.  I must have remembered wrong -- sorry folks :-)."

vandwellers,33nl22,DaftBunkVan,-1,Sun Apr 26 22:43:35 2015 UTC,I really don't think fridges are realistic without an external generator.  They just take too much energy to run off a battery.

However I also vandwelled out of a truck with a contractors topper with little more than a sterno stove, a foam pad and a sleeping bag.   My suggestion is don't go too overboard at first. Start very simple and get a feel for what you miss or what you need then start adding those things as you see fit.   The biggest thing, is make sure you are comfortable from the start. Focus on things like air ventilation, perhaps insulation then a comfortable bed & something to sit on.   Put a bit of thinking into your meals as well. One thing I learned from my truck experience was that not having a ""convenient"" cooking set up, made me eat out a lot.  Doing this cost a lot of money which I could have otherwise saved."

vandwellers,33lijk,BeerPowered,3,Thu Apr 23 17:21:26 2015 UTC,"What's the situation regarding bigger fuel efficient vans in USA? I've heard that MB Sprinter and Ford Transit were introduced only recently, while in Europe we had Ducato/Jumper/Boxer, Sprinter/LT/Crafter, Ford Transit, VW Transporter, Iveco Daily and tons of similar vans for quite a while already. These are everyday sight for me, that's why it appeared interesting.  I personally don't even know what my dream va is, anything that can fit a motorbike alongside living space inside is good for me."
vandwellers,33lijk,JLSMC,2,Thu Apr 23 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"They seem to have some larger van offerings with better fuel efficiency, but that's a relatively new thing.  I've seen some diesel Sprinters for around 15K now, but you're still looking at 150K+ miles  When you're talking something that doesn't get goods mileage to begin with, any extra efficient you can get makes a big difference.   Go from 12 to 18 for example and you just reduced your fuel costs by 50%. Going from 15 - 20 is 33% less.   So if I can get a larger van running in the low 20s, that opens up the travel budget a lot."
vandwellers,33lijk,64mb,6,Thu Apr 23 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"I've had to convert that to l/100km and 20mpg means over 11 l/100km. Many many many vans do way better than that. Our old work Transporter does 7 average, that's over 30 American units. Plenty of newer big vans can easily do that or even better.  And also yes - 150k miles is not much. Sprinters can run for million if taken care of properly."

I was thinking about doing a flat piece, but with a wooden piece that long, would hit the roof before being fully open. Also, I was thinking that with the double folding piece, it could fold into a sort of ""couch back"", then I could design this sort of ""net accessory"" with canvas and wire (or possibly ratchet straps to get it really tight), that attaches tightly over the top of the storage to make a seat. So you can sit on the ""couch"" and look out the back while camping."

Driving an RV as a daily driver sucks and the mpg is even worse in almost all cases.   If you are planning to do a lot of driving, IMO a van will always win over an RV. If you plan to stay in the same place for go to campgrounds to camp then a RV is better."
vandwellers,33jpv5,crockett5,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, considering I'd be moving around a lot and it would be my daily driver, an RV would quickly become a pain in the ass.  I've toyed with the idea of keeping my car and towing it, but of course that would further cut down my mpg and make maneuvering even more difficult."

We live in an RV, but I happen to drive a van we once were intending to live in (we abandoned the plan and bought the RV, but I've still got the van because shrug why not). So, being able to compare an E150 with the 5.4 engine to an actual real life RV, I can tell you this is it the only right answer.   If we were a) more handy and b) I didn't NEED a dog, we'd be vanning it up for this exact reason. I love the RV, but it's a pain in the ass."

vandwellers,33jpv5,ruat_caelum,6,Sat Apr 25 16:37:09 2015 UTC,IMO RVing is something wealthy or retired people do.  You need a steady income to pay for hook ups and spots.  Vandwelling is more stealth and much cheaper because you find free parking and live off city amenities.
vandwellers,33jpv5,boatrightp,2,Fri Apr 24 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"I think a better way of wording it is saying the van dwelling allows you the option to live illegally if you so choose. (You can't really hide a camper easily where as you can a van.) But there are a lot of people that camp on BLM or national land / walmart / campgrounds, and pay to stay, or stay legally for free.  And its only cheaper if you aren't ticketed or towed."
vandwellers,33jpv5,Chuck3131,3,Sun Apr 26 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"I've done all kinds of RV's over the years, from 23' class C's up to 31' Class A's.  Am in the process of selling my current one, a 27.5' class C.  Yes, they are nice, roomy, all the amenities of home.  You also have a lot of stuff that is inefficient, that requires upkeep, and can break on you.  MPG sucks, of course.  It's not always easy to find parking, and maneuvering is a pain.  They are more nerve wracking driving, in my opinion, constantly worrying about the length and width going down the road and in the city.  And it takes a lonnnnggg time to get them stopped in a pinch (nearly wrecked because of it).  Most of the things you use in the RV pretty much needs either the generator running or being hooked up (ie. park fees which can add up over time).  The RV is in the process of being sold now.  I have bought a van and have outfitted it myself.  No, it won't be as roomy or have all the neat things the RV did.  But, mostly, it's just me on the road, so the space is cool with me.  I can park it in any size parking space.  The mileage doubled.. even though not great, better than the RV.  And, can park it just about anywhere to stealth camp as it looks just like any other full size conversion van you see all over (ie. no parking fees).  Everything in it has a place and doesn't move, so I feel comfortable driving it daily, even when not on the road.  Just my .02 worth."

In my opinion, I think that if you want to be closer/in cities then go with a van. If you want to be out in the woods a RV would be better. Vans will get you better fuel economy. Look at larger sprinter type vans; with the ability to get high roofs and long wheelbases they offer many of the RV advantages but with the fuel economy and 'stealthy' that a van provides. I have been looking at the 170"" wheelbase sprinter vans."

You are talking 30+/- year old vans with most Vanagons and 40s with most type 2s.   With that said, it's likely easier to keep a type 2 on the road vs a type 3 as the type 2s were much simpler, but each will have its quirks.   I only have experance with vanagons but I'd actually like to give a type 2 a try at some point. Jeffmonkey actually has the exact van I'd want if i got a type 2.  A 72 high top.. (I was born in 72 and I like the high top type 2s)  As far as people living in them, I've seen quite a few people traveling in Types 2s even met a couple in Texas whom was living in a type 1 going on 2 years.  They aren't for everyone, but specially with the type 2s and 1s you will meet a lot of people just because the the van. Even with my vanagon its a easy way to meet people as its a easy conversation piece.  However once again, You don't have to be a master mechanic but you really should be willing to turn some wrenches. The good part is the VW comunity is pretty strong and there are places like thesamba.com where you can get all the info you ever thought you might need.

If you have the drive to own one, there are amazing resources available like rob and daves aircooled pages, thesamba, Richard atwells VW pages(ratwell), the Bentley service manual and the idiots guide to keeping your Volkswagen alive. The other people with a VW is a resource as well. If you're going to do it I recommend planning ahead and taking care of the mechanical stuff that's harder to do without a home base, for peace of mind. I did ball joints, tie rods, the normal engine and tranny seals, checked and greased the wheel bearings, checked and cleaned the brakes(the whole system.) I've been in my 72 for almost two years and have had minimal issues...I did have a dash fire last night and sat on the side of the road rewiring for a couple hours. You carry lots of tools and spare parts.  I don't have experience with the Vanagons so my take is based off aircooled. Crocket might chime in for the vanagon side."

vandwellers,33iv95,kenbw2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"Your alternator contains a regulator, which both maintains a constant voltage output and monitors battery level. It stops sending charge when the battery is full, thus preventing overcharging:  http://www.autoshop101.com/trainmodules/alternator/alt111.html  A solar controller / charger has a similar feature and the two will quite happily work together. If the alternator is running, the solar charger will stop charging; if the solar charger has fully charged the battery, the alternator will not keep charging.  So your option 1 is absolutely the correct set up. Your voltage sensing relay serves to isolate your starter battery when parked up, to stop it being drained.  EDIT: While it looks OK, I can't confirm the way you plan to wire up your VSR is 100% correct as I don't know what each terminal is for - but the principle of where it sits in the circuit is right. There should be specific instructions available for the device you have."
vandwellers,33iv95,jester_hope,0,Tue May 12 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely do not send your alternator through the charge controller.  They spit out way more than 30A (the alternator on my E-350 diesel is 200A).    What I'm wondering is whether I should leave my house batteries separate and only charge them via solar, or if I should connect them to the starter battery/alternator, and if so what is the safest way to do that."
vandwellers,33iv95,bandit_leader,2,Wed Apr 22 22:29:17 2015 UTC,They spit out way more than 30A (the alternator on my E-350 diesel is 200A).   If it were true that the battery pulled anywhere near 200A it'd be charged in under an hour (ignoring the fact that it'd blow my 30A fuse and split charge relay)  The alternator might be capable of packing out 200A (on mine IIRC it's 75A) but there's no way the battery can pull that much.
vandwellers,33iv95,bandit_leader,2,Wed Apr 22 22:48:30 2015 UTC,"You are correct that the alternator rating is a capacity and not what it's constantly outputting.  In my experience however, batteries can charge very quickly from alternators.  I expect the lower the battery is the more current it is capable of pulling.  The fact that the alternator is capable of outputting more than 30A makes me wary enough to not want to send it through a 30A-rated charge controller.  At the very least I'd put a 30A fuse between the alternator and charge controller."
vandwellers,33iv95,bandit_leader,2,Wed Apr 22 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"If you see my current setup diagram you'll see that the fuse is rated at 30A, and that hasn't blown.  I did have the same concern when buying the 30A relay so I spoke to the manufacturer of the relay, and his assessment is that the battery probably pulls about 7Amps.  And to do the maths, if it were charging above 30 Amps, I'd see my battery being charged to full in less than an hour. I know from experience that that isn't the case. If it were I wouldn't be bothering with solar.  Nothing supports a > 30 A charge rate"

I'm curious to see if anyone chimes in regarding your worries about overcharging.  It's not something you'd ever worry about with a starter battery, but I don't know how differently house batteries handle things.  In the first setup your charge controller certainly wouldn't be trying to send juice to the batteries with the alternator running.  It would see the 14V (or whatever the alternator outputs) and decide that your batteries don't need any more help from it.  The question then is whether or not a house battery can get overcharged by an alternator.  My guess is no..."
vandwellers,33iv95,ruat_caelum,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"It would see the 14V (or whatever the alternator outputs) and decide that your batteries don't need any more help from it.   That's what I thought at first, but then I've run a multimeter on the battery while the alternator is charging. The circuit (as outptted by the alternator can be at 13.7V while the battery itself is 12.9V or thereabouts. From what I can tell, the controller would see the battery's voltage, not the circuit in general. The difference lies in whether the negative is grounded to the chassis (for 13.7V readings) or returned to the battery (for 12.9V readings)   The question then is whether or not a house battery can get overcharged by an alternator. My guess is no...   I don't claim to be an expert really in any of this - I've just spent a few months researching things while I've been setting them up in my van.  My understanding is overcharging is just as much an issue for both leisure and starting batteries. The overcharging is managed:   In an alternator by the voltage regulator - this prevents a voltage output greater than 14.4V (this isn't the voltage of the battery itself though) In solar by the solar controller - this detects the battery side voltage and cuts off if it's greater than 13.8V (or whatever it's set to)   I suppose given these facts it should in theory be safe to run both solar and alternator together, but remembering that   In Option 1 the solar part would have no knowledge of the alternator part, so with the alternator running, the solar controller would keep charging until the battery (not the circuit) got to 13.8V. The alternator would continue to charge up to its own limit of 14.4V In Option 2, the solar controller would just detect an input which is the sum of the alternator and solar (let's say 7A and 5A respectively) and keep charging until the battery is at 13.8V   I think, thinking aloud, that it means I can do either with no real difference in outcome. But I'm not sure, and would appreciate anyone who could chime in on this"
vandwellers,33iv95,auwham,0,Wed Apr 22 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"there is a big difference. Look at the case when the charge controller sees a full battery. most pwm or mppt controllers will go into float mode and pass a high voltage say 14.7 with a tapering amp dropping down to <1 amp. Chemically this is the anodes and cathodes becoming as separated as they can be. (when power is generated the ions move from one to the other. when fully charged this is reversed. A float charge is that resistance that keeps the battery from discharging.  Move over in most lead acid type batteries the memory discharge stuff is partially reset by doing the proper float charge. Over time with no use the 1 amp charge will drop even more. In a perfect math world or ideal lab it gets to the point where all the ions are in the most electronegative position they can occupy. The force that keeps them there is the float charge.  You don't really need the slow curve for the starting battery nor do you really need the float charge (though many places will tell you that.) because of how the batteries are made. On the deep cycle you do.  If you can, you want the charge controller to be the only thing connected to the battery and all the incoming power routed through that."
vandwellers,33iv95,auwham,0,Sun Apr 26 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"That all makes sense. One thing I realised though is that anything between the solar and the controller is at 19.5V, which doesn't do batteries any good.  The wire from my starting battery to what would be the controller would be in contact with the solar panel directly, before it's been stepped down. Would I have to worry about that 19.5V making its way to my starting battery?"
vandwellers,33iv95,64mb,0,Sun Apr 26 13:13:15 2015 UTC,"the 19.5 volts is max voltage from solar panel, its why you use the controller (EDIT changed this to controller from inverter made a mistype.)  The diode in the line from alternator / alternator+start battery, should be enough to insure you don't get any energy from that side of the fire wall until you break the voltage limit on the diode say 5 volts, and will mean voltage passes in one direction.  Since the + (positive) of both the solar and alternator + start battery will be landed on the same terminal on the charge controller you will have no issues. Because there is not circuit from solar to start battery (even without a diode). There are two circuits to the controller and out. Three if you count the battery loop, or four if you count the dump load loop. If you don't have a dump load resistor you want to get one.  You have two circuits. solar to + on charge controller, then everything the charge controller does, feeds loads, charges batteries etc, and returns the flow to the negative terminal on the charge controller. This neg term is connected to both the car frame for the alt + start battery loop, and to the solar panel loop.  To get flow from solar into start battery, you either need it under the charge controller or need the positive on the solar battery connected to neg terminals of charge controller and then neg solar connected to car frame / batt terminals.  No you do not need to worry about the 19.5 (possible) volts on or across the starting battery."
vandwellers,33iv95,ruat_caelum,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:49:10 2015 UTC,The best solution here would be a redarc smart battery isolator. It joins your start and aux battery as soon as you start batt hits its charged state whilst charging from your alternator. Wehrmacht the engine stops it will disconnect your start battling when it battery voltage drops enough but still leaves heaps in the start battery to start your car with ease. Wire in your solar panel to your aux battery. Idiot proof and no switches to forget about
vandwellers,33fvod,DisastroVan,3,Wed Apr 22 04:36:35 2015 UTC,Yes a computer fan is fine and will run on the 12v. You can find out how many watts the light bulb is and that will give you an idea of how much those wires can handle.
vandwellers,33fvod,matrixifyme,2,Wed Apr 22 09:42:40 2015 UTC,"The bulb itself pulls .98A. The fuse block is fused for 30A. The fan I have purchased (Cooler Master 200m) will pull .3A at max speed. I have gone ahead and purchased both a switch and a variable speed control knob that I will install alongside the fan (and install a switch on the front dome light) so I can always have the dome light's wiring be ""on"", but the switch will keep the circuit from being complete, allowing me to power the light/fan whenever I want. :)"
vandwellers,33fvod,DazarGaidin,3,Wed Apr 22 18:52:53 2015 UTC,Keep in mind the dome light is probably wired to the switch that comes on when the door is opened/you force the lights on (on mine i turn the dial for the dash lights all the way back).  Id imagine you want to operate it at other times.
vandwellers,33fvod,crockett5,2,Wed Apr 22 10:15:28 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind, that the dome light is wired to your van's starter battery and a 12v fan will likely run the battery dead much faster than the light bulb would."
vandwellers,33fvod,fluxofapathy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:09:23 2015 UTC,"So, after math I have found that my back dome light pulls .98A and the fan (at max power) will pull .3A. The fan will last 3 times as long as the battery would running on it's own. :)"

I'm open to many types of vehicles, (full size van, mini van, station wagon), and see benefits to each, so how will i know what's truly right for me?   Look around on craigslist and on the internet and test vehicles out until you get an idea of what suits you best.  Basically what I would do in your situation is keep working a job until you can afford a reliable van/truck setup that you can live in and wont mind living in for a while.   Try camping for long periods at a time to see if vandwelling is truly for you.  I personally think a good base (a solid and reliable vehicle/van/truck) is one of the most important aspects, and slowly build your rig from there by keeping on working and saving and growing."

If you are driving cross country to met friends from the internet sounds like a cheap torture-porn movie, or bad horror.  How do other women take care of things like birth control and lady check ups on the road? Maybe you can get some input not only on how but on cost.  Doing the whole ""diving into the deep end"" from home school to living on your own with little to no safety net either financially or socially scares the crap out me for you.  By all means live in the van. Do so within driving distance of your parents house for a year. IF you can make it that long. This isn't criticism but do you have the social skills to just pick up random work in random areas for some money?  How do you plan on eating in say Kansas when you've been out of work for two weeks. Now what happens if you're only means of transportation breaks down?  I hope you take this advice in the nature it is given which is that you should think about it. Give it an honest thirty minutes. You don't have to answer here, these questions are for you not us.   How much money is 'enough' that you feel you can make it if the world shits on you, (van breaks down, fired from job, etc.) Some people can get buy on $500 emergency fund, others would say they get nervious under 2500. (or whatever number) How much does food cost? Do you shop for groceries often? You work in the store, how much money are people paying on average for food. That is just food. What skills or qualities do you have to get work (It is probably not realistic that you will 'make it' as a musician) This is not to say do not pursue it as a career or to shoot down your dream, only to ask you to honestly assess how many people 'want' to be musicians and how many people make a living from it. How much maintenance cost does the van need? What about fuel? How much is car insurance and plates, how do you legally get new stickers for the plates if you don't have an Ohio address? (Because having your van towed on you will mean you are now homeless in a strange city.) This is the scariest one to me. How good of friends are your internet friends. Everyone says things like, come on by and crash on the sofa. They don't mean it. They mean, on your way through town I would put you up for one night. I think a lot of artist are starving artist. Not because their art doesn't sell or whatever, but because it doesn't sell well enough. The joke about people with art degrees learning how to say, ""would you like fries with that."" Is a thing because most art majors have to get paid a living wage from something other than their art, be it music, painting, writing (my own hobby,) or whatever. You need to honestly evaluate your music or whatever and say. 'can I live off this?' But I'm guess if you even have to ask the question the answer is no."
vandwellers,33e9zj,kybishop,5,Wed Apr 22 04:55:34 2015 UTC,"This is the cold hard truth. I think people should live in their vans for two reasons:   For the freedom, when you can make the transition smoothly, with an exit plan should it not be for you. Out of necessity because shit is hitting the fan.   If you don't fall into either of those categories, I can't say I recommend vandwelling; it isn't for everyone, and you need to be sure you're up for it before diving in.  All that aside, you might benefit greatly from diversifying your experiences in life. One of the most awesome things you can do is experience the world, and what better way to do so than with a job in an amazing place that provides you with a free place to stay?  Sites like http://www.coolworks.com/ are amazing for these kinds of jobs, and depending on where you stay, you'll probably run into some vandwellers while you're out there!  Get out there and experience life, dial in what you want, and figure out what the world has to offer.

I'm also a musician (bassist) and I will have my full bass rig plus a small PA system in the van with me. Could never fit all that in a mini van. As to where to go, look for a mild climate where it doesnt crazy cold or crazy hot. Maybe the Oregon coast? As to making money at music, I live in Vancouver Canada and the money you make isnt very much. Definitely not enough to live on but it does supplement.

I want to do it for many reasons but the biggest one being that I want to be a musician and I don't expect to make much if any money off that for a long while, if ever, so the van life will ease the poverty level off a bit.   Anyway, just wanted to give you a bit of advice from my experience, having lived in a car last year for 4 months. The first month was hard. I wasn't used to it and I found it hard to sleep and worried about what people thought of me. I also had to try parking in lots of different places. Eventually though I got a nice groove and ended up largely parking in a parking lot with a bunch of other people living in their vehicles, we were like a big carpark family, it was lovely! I ended up moving out of the car in the end mostly because it started leaking incessantly whenever there was rain. Waking up to a wet sheet and mattress sucked :(  So my tips are; don't give up if it's hard at first, it will get way easier. And for the love of god, ensure that whatever vehicle you buy is not going to leak!  Good luck :)"

How good are you at busking, you might want to try playing on the street a few times and see what kind of money you can pull, how hard it is for you to do it etc.  Eventually of course you want to get a steady gig or two.  Check out http://www.tosimplify.net/ he does music work for a living.  He did some of the music for family guy. There is a guy who does jingles for a living too.  But he does other stuff to make money.  I think you should consider that while you can make some money playing music until you 'made it' you might have to diversify a little with other jobs, or side hustles.  But hey, consider that your expenses will be lower than every other person trying to make it in music except for the ones who live on the street (like my friend Daniel in New Orleans ) If you are good, you can do stuff online too, like youtube, patreon, aor do a kickstarter to fund a CD, or if desperate, fiverr gigs."

By all means pursue it aggressively, but have cash in reserve, and another reliable way of making more. Also, recognize that the fewer skills you have (cooking, car maintenance and repair, etc.), the more money you need. I suggest you keep working for a little while longer, be frugal, stockpile some cash and take a few courses at a local community college, maybe automotive tech, maybe a couple of introductory trade courses.

We take for granted running water, flushing toilets, showers, and laundry facilities. You need to be clean.  Get a Planet Fitness or other gym membership to use their showers. And also to stay healthy? shrug  Buy 15 each of the very lightest weight full sets of clothing you can. If you have clothing that folds up super small you can conserve space, wash it all in one or two loads at the laundromat once every two weeks, and still be fresh and clean every day.  Get three or four sets of lightweight sheets & pillowcases for the same two week cycle.  Get AAA.  Kids these days are lucky to live in a time where you have phone, text, computer, camera, flashlight, internet, video games, and Netflix all in a tiny device that fits in your shirt pocket.

You can always dabble in other things or change directions later, but for now you want to get good at one thing so you can start making money with it sooner than later. Busking can make you some money if you have talent and find the right spot. You definitely dont need to have a career first.  I would go full size van for comfort and stealth. A common enough model to find parts, and old enough to have reasonable insurance costs. There are lots of old posts on this sub with vehicle recomendations. Do your research.   Open a separate checking account and save up enough money in it to cover all your bills for 6 months while you are on the road. Insurance, AAA, gym membership, phone bill can be set on auto pay so all you have to worry about is food and gas. Once you have this cushion you can hit the road and have some time to wander and figure out another source of income. Rice, vegetables, and ramen are very inexpensive. When traveling from one city to another, post an ad on Craigslist rideshare. Asking gas money from passengers can pretty much eliminate your gas costs.   Since you are from a rural area I'm assuming you don't want to head straight for NYC. Pick a medium sized college town and make that a quasi goal to start meandering over once you have money saved. College towns are lots of fun and tend to be more arts friendly. Bigger cities have more job opportunities too like washing dishes or temp agency gigs."

Usually it's an aftermarket or dealer option for people whom will be putting the engine under a lot of stress.. (usually only found in racing applications TBH)  Is this a regular gas engine? Like a 4.3 V6 , 305 or 350 V8? I can't imagine any regular van with a normal gas engine needing a oil cooler.   Are you 100% sure it's not a sutomatic transmission cooler?"
vandwellers,33fbze,crockett5,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"It's a V8 5.7L engine.  The mechanic did say we could still drive it but just to check the oil often as it leaks a bit.   I hear what you're saying about it being aftermarket, so does that mean dining an actual original manufacturer part is likely impossible? At this point it feels like that might be the only option as we tried the two other hoses you can get at the regular auto parts store."
vandwellers,33fbze,crockett5,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:58:40 2015 UTC,"I can't say for 100% certain that it's not factory. However I've honestly never heard of any small block Chevy engine having an oil cooler from the factory. I had a 93 Chevy G20 which I used for work years ago but it only have the V6 in it.  I'd have to say it would almost have to be some sort of aftermarket kit or maybe a dealer option, but even then it would probably be an after market kit.   Now a automatic transmission cooler is a very common option, specially for trucks & vans which might pull or carry heavy loads. However that would be cooling the transmission fluid not the motor oil.  Honestly, I'd take it to another mechanic and get their opinion. If it is an oil cooler there is probably no reason it can't just be unhooked & plugged off."
vandwellers,33fbze,crockett5,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"So it turns out I was wrong. The previous mechanic was adamant about the oil cooler hose but when I just moved the can today to check the leak, I dabbed a napkin in the small puddle underneath the car and it came back pink/red. So it looks like it may be a transmission leak which lines up a lot more when what everyone has been saying.   Taking it to another mechanic tomorrow to see if I can get to the bottom of this!   Thanks for the advice, I wouldn't have thought to check anything transmission related."
vandwellers,33fbze,peewinkle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:28:51 2015 UTC,"Yea that makes more sense. One thing to note, vans tend to suck to work on due to bad access to the front of the motor.

From the other vehicles in the photo, it seems like the seller is a dealer of sorts. If that's the case, he wants a return and probably knows how to sell.  To get to a fair price: Have the mechanic look at it, then tally the costs of repairs. Find your next best alternative van, estimate the negotiated price of it, plus estimated repair costs. That's known as your BATNA, in negotiation lingo: Best Alternative To the Negotiated Agreement. This is the maximum you will offer.  Now try to figure out the seller's BATNA. Get information about the situation. How many people are interested in the van? How much did the seller pay for it? How much does it cost him to hold in the lot? This estimate is the minimum the seller will accept.  Now shoot for a price between the two.  Don't be afraid to walk away.  Hopefully that'll either save you from paying too much, or to get you a fair price. All those small things really add up..."

vandwellers,33f336,earthfront,2,Wed Apr 22 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"I was wondering why someone would want even $3500 for a 29-year-old van, and then I saw that it was 4WD. Besides what everyone else has said, I would say - find out who did the 4WD conversion and when. I'd also be curious to know the size of the engine; it's not in the ad. I'm not sure about the 250s but I've seen Ford vans with 6 cylinder engines. This is not something I know much about but I would think all that extra weight would need a decent-sized engine.  About the 4WD - Do you really need it for whatever you're planning to do, or is that just a bonus? Have you driven it in 4WD, and if you have, how does it act?  The best suggestion I can make though is what others have said - *get a mechanic to look at it. *This van is almost 30 years old; you need to know not just what's been fixed/replaced but what needs to be done, especially if it's related to safety, and you might be able to use that to negotiate the price - or help you decide to pass on it. You said you're willing to pay even $4300, but what if the needed repairs end up costing you a whole lot more than that?  I know you really want it; I've been there and I know what that feels like, and I did act on it. And it was a mistake :( . I'm not saying that this is for you, I'm just saying - get a professional opinion on it so you know exactly what you're getting into before you commit."
vandwellers,33f336,kimadagem,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:27:44 2015 UTC,"Getting the a/c and speedometer fixed could be very expensive, and with the radio broken it could be an easy fix or it could be something more serious? I would definitely splurge the 30-40 bucks to have a mechanic look it over before you bought it. Check the carfax that should hopefully tell you if the odometer has rolled over or not. You can do this for free by getting the vin number and pretending to sell it on ebay. Also it says rebuilt engine not new so a rebuilt engine could mean a lot or a little. That thing is going to be tall as shit if you lift it even more haha but hey if that's the look you like then sure. This definitely has potential from the little I can see what with the 4wd and monster tires, could make for some serious backroad excursions if ya know what I mean. What are you planning to do with the interior? This thing is pretty bare bones so I feel you could find something also plain but a little nicer for similar prices. Good luck bud."
vandwellers,33f336,karmaisdharma,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not too worried about the radio or A/C really. Worse comes to worse, I just put my own speakers. And it doesn't get too hot here in the summer. I don't plan on staying in it during the day if I'm living in it. At nights it's cool.   Yeah it's already ridiculously tall. The turning radius isn't too bad without lifting it more, so I guess that's kind of optional. I could always put a bit smaller tires, but that would cost a bit too....   I've never owned a vehicle I could take offroad so I do think that's the part that's hanging me up from just passing on this vehicle. It's like a fucking monster truck. That thing would go anywhere from what I can tell lol.   I'd love to add solar panels, and eventually I'd like to get a sort of sink setup, and little propane camp stove area. Plenty of room for a bed. I'd probably end up using plastic bins and drawers though. I've never done carpentry stuff, but all this would be a neat little project where I could learn a bunch I guess.   My main concern is if this is going to break down or not anytime soon. I would love to have this even just to have as a vehicle. It'd be a lot of fun taking it offroad and going places I normally couldn't. Realistically that seems like a rare event. And I'm sure it gets about 13mpg.   I think maybe it's just a dream van that isn't realistic for me to actually get, especially not at the price it's at. But I'm also young and have the safety net of my parents. But realistically I don't know how long it would take for me to get too annoyed by the minor issues and gas mileage.   I could add so much stuff in it with all that room though. The seats are real easily removable too. Super spacious. No stealth though, but my mom would be fine with me parking it in her driveway if nothing else.   I really don't know what I should do..."
vandwellers,33f336,karmaisdharma,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yea dude it's definitely long as hell so I can understand wanting it for all the room. Correct though, not very stealth and say you do want to travel somewhere warmer think about not having any a/c. If the lowest he goes is 4,000 I'm sure you'll be putting maybe another 1,000 into it for the lift/new tires and all the things you want to throw inside (stove/bed etc). I say just wait it out man. I honestly can't see this thing selling in the next day or two for $4,500. Maybe in a month he'll take the $3,500. Like I said top 2 things would be to check the carfax and have a mechanic look over it. After those two things you'll have a better idea and perhaps even more leverage to get him to lower the price. ""If it's not fuck yea its no"". Remember that quote. You seem stoked on the van but you also seem like you wouldn't really mind letting this one pass..."

I wouldn't mind getting it for 3500  and having to put some money into it, but anywhere near 4500 is way too much lol. I'll just say 3500 and leave the rest up to him. It'd be a better decision to find something else, I just think the monster tires and being lifted and all that room is really neat."

""2 other guys looking at it"" shiiiit they're gonna offer him $2,500. Start doing some research into this specific model, and how hardy the engines are and what not. To be honest I overpaid a bit for my van and I don't regret it, I love my van. Let us know how things are looking for you in the next week or two, happy hunting.

He didn't know a whole lot about it, but was trying to talk it up despite all the things wrong with it.   I wouldn't mind overpaying for it by a bit since it really just draws me in for some reason. I'm just going to keep my 3500 offer for sure though. It took me all evening to finally decide on that 100%. If he doesn't take that, then it's obviously not the van for me.

vandwellers,33f19j,dokupehakase,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"Just cut the wire on the end of the wall wart that doesn't plug into the wall, and black goes to black red goes to red. You just need 12v going to the little white box.   I'd also like to warn you that that particular model of LED strip/white box thing has a few cases reported of it catching on fire. It's cheap china made. The one I got of that, same model as yours, ended up breaking shortly after getting it, luckily not from combustion though."
vandwellers,33f19j,dokupehakase,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"It's worked fine when I plug it into the wall. Yikes, I wonder if it caught on fire because it was getting too many volts put through it? What happened to yours, I assume it just pooped out? Luckily it's 25 bucks so I don't mind if something happens. I'm mainly worried about breaking it because I wire it wrong. When my engine is running the auxiliary battery gets over 14 volts, so I'm not sure how to make sure the LED's are hooked up safely and what kind of fuse to put on it. Should I cut it to the left or right of that little black cylinder that is a few inches to the left of the white box??"
vandwellers,33f19j,dokupehakase,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah it lasted maybe a month and then one day wouldn't turn on at all. Dunno what caused the fires just that there's a few amazon reviews saying so, and I remember replying to someone's post on reddit /r/advice who had it catch fire. I thought it funny that I had just bought the same thing recently to his catching fire.   The black cylinder is for electrical noise or something like that iirc. I'd cut before it so that it's still there. I don't know what to do about it being 14v while running, you'll have to consult someone else for that. To wire it though, you could test it real easy, just touch the red to red black to black and it should light up if you turn it on. Twist the wires if you'd like. Be very very sure not to short it together though (touch the red and black). Ideally you'd solder the wires and put some heat shrink around each connection. Probably a 5A or 6A even, since the wall wart originally put out 12v 5A ,but I'm kind of guessing there.   LEDs are diodes, so electricity only flows one direction, so you can't really hurt it by wiring black to red and vice versa, it just wont' turn on, afaik. The only thing you could mess up really is giving it too much voltage, or shorting the wires together, but that would harm your battery, not the LEDs. So a fuse would be good for that.   Sorry, I only have a basic understanding of electricity after working for an arcade operator for a year. Things aren't too hard to diagnose, but I don't have a complete understanding of how things work."
vandwellers,33f19j,dokupehakase,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:22:07 2015 UTC,Shouldn't there be some kind of adapter that plugs into the white controller box but instead of going to an ac plug it just turns into a red and black wire? Seems crazy to start hacking away at your ac adapter if you want to use it at a later time. So how many watts or volts do you think would be enough to fuck up the LED strip?
vandwellers,33f19j,danielblakes,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:28:21 2015 UTC,"Sure you could buy a barrel plug for it that has exposed wires already if you know the size and just hook it up to that. The AC adapters I bought for my LED strips were like $10 for the 2 of them I think, so I didn't mind hacking one up, and if I wanted to use the barrel plug again with it, it would be easy enough for me to solder it back on. Not for a van or anything, but for at home use.   Well afaik, it's OK to have more amps than needed as it only draws what it uses. If something shorted out though, it would draw all the amps the battery would put out and possibly start a fire or damage your battery so that's the reason to use a fuse. I'd go with 6A or whatever the next size is as long as it isn't too much larger, in case it draws a little over 5A or something. But maybe see if a 5A works without blowing first if you want.   As far as voltage, it's normal for batteries to be a volt or 2 higher than what the voltage says it is. So being 14v sometimes shouldn't matter much. At most it would shorten the life a bit for the LEDs. I asked in a irc channel for electronics and a guy said for a strip that uses resistors between the LEDs, it's definitely fine. So look on your strip, it's the same as mine so I assume it does, and you should see little metal resistors every 2 LEDs or so.   edit: a bit misinformed, battery powered things will convert the battery voltage to a constant voltage, but that part of it is still powered by a voltage that's within a couple volt range around the rated voltage."

vandwellers,33c7b9,9bikes,4,Tue Apr 21 13:16:31 2015 UTC,"I just can't justify spending that much money on anything which is going to depreciate.   We had a van with an air mattress until a couple on months ago. We bought a used 21' motorhome for less that 1/2 the price of that Roadtrek.  The whole motorhome vs. van decision depends so much on what kind of camping you are going to do. 21' is still much harder to park than a van and a motorhome is so much less stealthy, that most people are better off with a van. A motorhome is better only when you are going to drive to an authorized camping spot and stay there for a longer time."

vandwellers,33b5oq,moldyshoe,3,Tue Apr 21 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"You don't mention what your budget is, but I will say that in the used car world, Carfax is your friend. I initially tried to buy a van on Craig's List to save money, but the first person I responded to was a serious scammer, and I decided that it just wasn't worth it, so I went to a dealership that my parents had used twice and that we trusted, and wound up with a fantastic, reliable mini-van that I truly love."
vandwellers,33b5oq,Persona_Transplant,3,Tue Apr 21 02:36:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, in this day and age, Craigslist is the biggest player in the ""For Sale By Owner"" category, although you can also try Autotrader. I almost always avoid dealers because you're going to pay 30-50% more, but sometimes that will include a warranty of short duration, so it might be worth it for you. I generally know exactly what I'm looking for before I start checking the ads (make, model, and year), so that saves a lot of time. Find something that looks interesting and contact the seller. Be prepared to not hear back, so don't contact just one seller at at time - contact as many as you're interested in. Many of the idiots that sell on there can't be bothered to delete their ads when they sell, nor respond to that effect. When somebody does get in touch, set up a time in the daylight to go and look and take it for a test drive. Taking somebody else with you is always a good idea too. I don't generally bother with taking it to a mechanic because I do all my own work, but you can ask to take it to one if you know one you trust (or bring him along). Check for rust, driveability, leaks, etc. If you have someone with you, have them check for smoke while you accelerate. Depending on state and county, you may need to have the vehicle emissions tested before you can register it and get plates. That's actually an advantage because if it passes, you can be reasonably sure the engine is in OK shape. Agree on a price, give them CASH in return for the title (making sure the numbers match the vehicle and it's signed off). In Colorado, the seller is supposed to do the emissions testing before they can sell a vehicle, but most of the ones on Craigslist don't. If it doesn't pass emissions, you won't be able to get plates, period. You will probably also have to have proof of insurance beforehand too, so contact an insurance company before you go to get plates and get that set up. Once you've done it a few times, it's actually fun, like buying myself a big new toy, but I've been doing this for a long time. YMMV."

You can move into a van with everything you need to live pretty cozy for around 600-800, but of course that just depends on your wants/needs.  Some people toss a duffel and sleeping bag in the back and go, adding on as they go along. I had time to do a conversion, which i think cost me around 1500 or so, the van itself is rough but only cost me 900 plus some lawn equipment (i never need again!) and i am living in it now 2 yrs later."

vandwellers,33b5oq,cookieguy10,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:08:52 2015 UTC,"I had a couple thousand saved and decided to spend it on buying a van instead of financing. I shopped around and kept hesitating until I finally just bought one off a guy on CL. For the money I was able to spend was limiting so I knew I would have to be flexible. I figured I could take what was left over and do some upkeep/repairs to keep the van working. Currently I am just living in the city so don't need something that needs to be road worthy just reliable to start up and drive short distance. If you look hard enough you can find great deals on vans. I live in California and vans seem to be priced higher than the ones I viewed in other states. You may have trouble getting a vehicle financed because of your age and the fact that you have no credit history. A co-sign would secure you. If you can work that you have a lot of options but you would need to make payments so if traveling is on the horizon keep that in mind. Also, check the back history of the vehicle before buying and it never hurts to bring along a mechanic. Happy shopping!"

vandwellers,33alox,crockett5,2,Mon Apr 20 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, it stays at 220. But now it's 220 amp hours at 12v rather than 220 amp hours at 6v. Think of it this way, when you're drawing power from a 6 volt battery, you're doing so at 6 volts, not at say 2 or 3 volts. Now you're able to withdraw the same 220A, but at 12 volts. It's twice as much total power because the voltage doubled. If you were to hook up both batteries in parallel, you would have 440 amp hours, but at the original 6v. You can double one or the other, but not both. On the other hand, if you use all 4 batteries, then both voltage and amp hours would double. Hope that helps."

The health effects of CO depend on the CO concentration and length of exposure, as well as each individual's health condition. CO concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm). Most people will not experience any symptoms from prolonged exposure to CO levels of approximately 1 to 70 ppm but some heart patients might experience an increase in chest pain. As CO levels increase and remain above 70 ppm, symptoms become more noticeable and can include headache, fatigue and nausea. At sustained CO concentrations above 150 to 200 ppm, disorientation, unconsciousness, and death are possible."

But a more typical van dweller might have a second battery in their future.  I really like West Mountain Radio's battery isolator. http://www.westmountainradio.com/product_info.php?products_id=iso_pwr  I think that charging the second battery off the alternator (and using a battery isolator) could be used in conjunction with a solar charger to great advantage.  Your deep cycle AGM battery will last a lot longer if you rarely take more than 20% of the charge off the top, so it is best to oversize the batteries from what you think you will need.  You can monitor the charge state by measuring the voltage on the battery.  The battery manufacturer publishes a little chart that maps charge remaining to voltage."

Then I got curtains with black out liner (white on the inside) and cut them out into  window shapes. I velcroed them to my windows. (Probably over kill).   When I drove i pushed the curtain aside and unvelcroed the windows.   Someone suggested using magnets for the window blocks. That may have been easier than my solution it took a long time to make.

Ford Econoline E150, E250, or E350 cargo van Chevrolet Express 1500, 2500, or 3500 cargo van  I see a lot of VW Vanagon vandwellers out there and it looks like a postcard of vagabonding. Unfortunately I've been a Vanagon owner and lived out of it as well, but I thought the design of the VW took away from the experience. The VWs have the engine in the back which is on the very platform that you would store things or use to put the bed on. Also in Hawaii where it's hot, the last thing I needed was more heat in the back. I would have to wait until the engine cooled before I climbed in the back otherwise it was like an oven.  My Vanagon cost me a ton of money and the engine didn't last very long after having it rebuilt. It could have been a shitty mechanic. I just had a bad experience with mine and every time I see one I scrunch up my forehead a bit. I guess it's sort of a cringe. I may be suffering from PFSD which is Post Fahrvergnügen Stress Disorder.   I'm currently in a 98 GMC 3500 with 66,800 miles. I bought it for $4,000 and it's been trouble free. It's a one ton cargo van and it's tough as hell. I have confidence in this van lasting for many years to come. The thing is an absolute beast. The only bad thing about GMC or Chevy vans is the paint tends to come off the roof and hood leaving exposed the body which then rusts if it isn't dealt with quickly. General Motors has been having their paint come off the vans for over two decades.   I've never owned an Econoline but they seem to be pretty solid.   I wish you luck in the Suburu camping."

I got a x cargo one made by thule for sears on craigs for 60 bucks. it had been used once. the next thing is reflectix in the windows. just cut to fit and the little frills on the edges you can press em it. On the back windows allow extra rest against the seatbelts. I use a sunshade in between the front seats and the back. I've used a thermarest to sleep on but found the exped mega mat to be cheap and awesome in the car and the tent. I usually move some stuff from the back into the passenger seat overnight. Good luck and have fun. Oh and extra towel or shammie for condensation in the morning.

For sleeping, I completely removed the back seats. I took a large plank of wood and attached two legs to it to create a bed. When i wanted to sleep, I'd push the driver seat all the way forward, and set the ""bed frame"" down so that the legs were supporting the plank of wood directly behind the front seat, and the rest of the plank of wood rested on the trunk area. Laid down a sleeping pad and that was my bed.   Stored stuff under the ""bed"" and on the side behind the passenger seat. I managed to fit a ton of stuff while staying really organized. I brought all my backpacking and rock climbing gear, a folding table and chair, a stove and dishes, lots of food, like three weeks worth of clothes. The only thing is every day I would spent about 20 minutes cleaning it. I would remove EVERYTHING from the car, shake it out, sweep out any dirt and dog hair, and then put it back together.

Even when high charge rates, the hydrogen is only a problem in the cells and immediately at the battery. The battery cells can explode if charging or discharging too high from a spark or flame. This is because of the confined gasses inside the cell. That is why the battery box needs venting."

vandwellers,330ssh,Vanbruh,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that air purification is an overlooked issue. I have a UV air purifer with HEPA filter for home use right now. I've been wondering how I would replace it with a more solar friendly model. I love what you have except for the Ions. Ions are great to get a smell out, but you should never be in the same room when an ionizer is running. Then you have to move all the air out with fresh air. I might order the model you have next paycheck and see if it's possible to solder in a switch for the Ion generator. If I end up doing it I'll make a post about it. If its something I can do with limited skills I'm sure most people could do it too.   Edit After looking into the subject more and looking at that filter I found some more photos of the unit on amazon. If you look at the 2nd to last photo there is a part labeled ""quartz burner"". That would be the ionizer/ozone generator. The unit sends electricity across it to generate ozone via the corona method. Would you mind checking to see if that quartz vial (glass tube with a steel mesh inside) is removable and if the machine still powers on with it out? If it still works with it out I will be ordering one of these soon for sure. Hope it does, because then it would be easy to only generate ozone when needed, compared to all the time."

House battery, deep cycle, marine / rv etc for storage. This size is based on things like how much amp hours do you want / need to use, dept of discharge, how much light you expect to get etc. simple disconnect switch so that while the van is running you can charge the house battery with the alternator (as it charges the regular battery.) MPPT controller. You can go pwm (or hell just a diode) but mppt is better in many ways and often same price or a few dollars / pounds more. check out aliexpress for mppt controllers to your door for about 20% to 40%% what you can get off a shelf. If you want more hands on or want to deal with the charge curves, float voltages etc you can get this from TI and program it the way you would with any arduino over in /r/arduino they can help. There are many arduino mppt builds based on Tim Nolan's designs. Just google those if you want to build one from scratch. I'd buy from ali express though something like this is 7.2 pounds Inverters if you want to go with ac power. You can get away with cheap clipped sine wave inverters for things like induction (motors) or resistive (hot plates, coffee makers, etc.) It cost more but full sine wave inverters are better / safer (to the electronics) for things that need them. I would bet you have nothing that would need a full sine wave.   summing up   Get the panel local unless you are ordering more than one panel then look to places like ali express. The shipping makes buying in bulk cheap but individualy for bigger items not worth it. get an mppt that works with your battery. i.e. an mppt for sealed battery or wet cell etc. figure out how to wire up something that will allow charging up of the house battery when the engine is running but that will not drain the main starting battery when the van is not running. (this can be simple or more complex and automated.)   If you have any questions i'd be happy to answer them."

vandwellers,32yvlq,ruat_caelum,3,Fri Apr 17 22:51:29 2015 UTC,"You cook inside the van? BBQ / hot plate etc? There are TEG options though using waste heat is best.  The Lemon with the solar is not understanding what power use you want vs how much you can capture.  So the question is how much power are you planning on using because that is the power you need to replace.  How big is the battery in amp hours, is it agm sealed, wet etc. (just link the model or product sheet from manufacturer.)  Also did you want a display regarding charging / battery usage.  Your relay (as drawn in the picture) will also be on. Is your starting battery deep cycle as well?  If you need help estimating power usage give me an idea of what you want to do minimally, every day, with your battery and we can work from there."

I have one 85Ah wet house battery. The engine battery is for the engine only, hence the relay.  Are you therefore asserting that a solar panel is a solar panel and if I want 100W then it really is just a case of sorting by price and getting the cheapest? (That is, for the panel. The controller is a separate question)"
vandwellers,32zxyh,MildlyEnragedOcelot,2,Sat Apr 18 03:52:36 2015 UTC,"The lifetime of a deep cycle battery is directly related to the ""depth of the discharge"" that it regularly experiences.  If you subject a deep cycle battery to 80% DOD on a regular basis (like this guy apparently does - I infer that he is off the grid often) you will get roughly half the life out of your battery than if you were to cycle it to 50% DOD - and then recharge.    Of course such a battery is designed to discharge to 80% DOD  - it is a deep cycle battery after all - but ideally to maximize the battery life - one should allow for recharging at around 50% DOD."

Sometimes I drive to customers if they're within 5 hours or so, sometimes I fly if they're farther than that. If I get a good van setup, I can live in it for when I drive around the region, and stay in hotels when I fly. The company pays for the hotel stay plus my vehicle parking in the airport lot.  I may be wrong, but I imagine driving around a 5 hour radius will provide enough little adventures to keep this interesting for a while. I would do it for a few years to pay off debts and attain a positive net worth!! I would probably do it long enough that I could buy a simple house with cash and stay out of debt permanently.  My goal is to do it very compactly, using a LWB new Transit Connect (not the Transit van!). The cargo area in that thing is essentially 6l x 5w x 4h, so thats not a lot to work with, but I have it planned out pretty well. They claim 22/30mpg, which is pretty outstanding.  I would do high stealth (100% stock from the outside including the top). I saw someone put sealable ventilation ports in the FLOOR and I think thats pretty clever, although it requires an active fan.

vandwellers,32xwex,Sunbolt,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:58:40 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about fuel costs I'd recommend something with a reasonably-modern diesel engine; that is, one that can run bio-diesel without modification[1].  Right now petro-diesel is cheaper than biodiesel, but that might not last. If oil prices go back up (which is probably not an if but a when) then you can switch to biodiesel, which has historically been more price-stable (but 'historically' doesn't mean much when the stuff has only been around for 25 years or so.)  On the other hand, some older IDI engines can burn nearly anything: used engine oil, transmission fluid, used veggie oil, and so on. This usually requires some modification (at least if you intend to continue using the engine for a while), for example additional filtering.  [1] The modifications required for older engines to run biodiesel usually amount to replacing lines and gaskets with Viton or another material that the biodiesel won't dissolve. If you're a confident diesel mechanic you might want to DIY; otherwise it's between a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand to have the mods done by a professional, depending on the engine type and on who you ask."

Biodiesel is about $2.90; back then it was about $3.25. If you bought biodiesel instead of rock diesel when it was at $4 (to say nothing of whatever price at which it peaked last year) then you'd save about .75 per gallon; doing the opposite now would save you about .30 per gallon. If you're driving a van around the country for a year, you're going to burn a lot of fuel. If we assume you do 10k miles in that year and that you average 25 mpg, then you use 400 gallons of gas. If you save 30 cents a gallon then you have saved yourself $120.   What 'associated costs' do diesel engines bring that gasoline engines don't?"

vandwellers,32unrj,vegasrandall,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:43:52 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if you made them or purchased them. They look good, how long did it take?"
vandwellers,32vbbo,aliemfilms,6,Fri Apr 17 00:33:39 2015 UTC,"This would be my suggestion, being you seem to want to do this but aren't sure where to start.   Go get yourself some basic camping gear, like a tent & some sleeping bags then start going on some random camping trips with your boyfriend on the weekends or even a week if you can manage to get away that long.  I assume you don't have a van already, which is why I suggest the tent. It's not the same as a van, but still traveling in a car and camping is still roughing it in a sense.  Doing this will help you figure out what you need while living on the road. Don't go crazy with the camp gear, but try to be comfortable and know that the camping gear isn't wasted as you can always use it in a van later on.  Not sure where you are located but you could try to find some free camping spots or hit a state park or maybe just find a place in a not hard to get to spot in the woods assuming you are in a car. If you go a week then do a mini road trip and try to budget well. If you do just the weekends, then plan something you can do which is fun or just go somewhere you want to go and camp near by."
vandwellers,32vbbo,crockett5,2,Fri Apr 17 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"This is wonderful advice, thank you!  I'm in Dallas, TX. I already practically live in my wagon since coming home to my parents is awkward. My boyfriend and I had to sleep in it for a night a couple weeks ago. We're already used to being in the car so much during the day since the DFW metroplex is car obsessed. Biking and public transport are impractical. Since we know the area pretty well, if we had a van we'd know where in the burbs and city we could possibly park it. I don't know of any camping spots because we've mainly stayed in the metroplex. Don't really have an rural connections or experience.  I camped once last summer for 9 days, stuck in a car with my boyfriend and 2 other guys. We camped in a tent at someone's place for a parkour event in Colorado Springs. I had never slept outside, but since I had a blow up mattress and relatively easy (however temporary) access to a bathroom or port-a-potty.   I don't have a van yet, but I'm saving for it now. My boyfriend might get one sooner as his living arrangements are already kind of inconsistent. If that happens I'll pitch in. Since we're not married (yet) my family won't let him stay with us (even though we have a huge house). I only come home now at nights to get sleep.   I have a station wagon right now that I would like to kind of test things out in the short term."
vandwellers,32vbbo,crockett5,2,Fri Apr 17 07:07:46 2015 UTC,"Station wagons aren't too bad you could even camp in it instead, just take time and set it up so it's comfortable. Texas isn't a bad spot other than it's hot. You do have a lot of neat destinations in Central Texas which would make easy weekend trips.  There is a lot of free beach camping along the coasts for example. Then of course Austin area is always something to do there."
vandwellers,32vbbo,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm working on my wagon. Main issue is that its super low to the ground and people can see in. It should be a pretty quick fix with some curtains. Also, sitting up in the wagon is kinda difficult. We have to hunch, so its really only good for sleeping right now. Thankfully that's the most important and doable one at the moment.   One issue I'm running into is that my wagon is under my parents name, so I can't do any serious modifications. Curtains should be alright. I'm thinking about getting some mesh for my sunroof for air flow. I figured foam may be the best option for bedding."

vandwellers,32vbbo,Bouncer827,2,Fri Apr 17 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"thank you! I figured practicing minimalism while I'm with the parents was the best learning avenue. Donated some clothes today actually, so yay!"
vandwellers,32vbbo,cliffdweller67,3,Fri Apr 17 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea... Keep only the absolute essentials (food, clothes, laptop/smartphone) and put everything else in a rented storage locker. Give someone else the key and tell them not to return it for 30/60/90 days... whatever you think will  really test you. Make them promise not to give it back until the elapsed time. Living in a van requires getting rid of anything but the essentials as thats all that will fit in a van. You could rent a storage locker on a longterm basis, but personally I think its best to get rid of the stuff you dont need and save yourself the rental fee. Take pics of anything that you really want to keep and store them digitally on the internet. Minimalism is a very freeing experience. As to the boyfriend, beware that living in 54 sq feet with another person is very hard on a relationship. Have a backup plan in case it all goes to crap. In fact, its very wise to have $2000- $3000 + saved up for emergencies. Best of luck!"
vandwellers,32vbbo,cliffdweller67,2,Fri Apr 17 06:52:30 2015 UTC,"An interesting idea for a test. I like it.  For my situation I don't think I'll have to worry about storage. We have friends and family that we know will hold onto things for us (they already have in the past).   My boyfriend is totally game and we've already lived together in a couple apartments. We house sat for someone who owned a Tiny House and they let us stay while they were gone. The experience was refreshing and inspiring. Granted it still wasn't 54 sq feet, but it was a tiny one room home. Couldn't have been more than 20x30.  Thank you for the advice. I'm trying to gauge how much to save and this is a great starting point. Much appreciated!! :)"

I personally don't really click with a lot of people at bars, even this one, but if I'm going to find someone into vandwelling and some of the other weird shit I'm into, it'll probably be there. A lot of people will ignore you, several will think you're weird, and a couple might click with you. If you're travelling, folks tend to find eachother. Rennies seem to find rennies, backpackers seem to find backpackers. If you move with the weather and tend to perform the same kind of work year round, you'll find folks that end up in the same spots as you in certain times of year.

Food and gas expensive as hell because everything is imported to Hawaii--they make macadamia nuts and pineapples and that's about it.

Everyone have collections from roof sources, and has to purify it. Everything is wet so finding wood to burn all the time to boil water will not be the best.  Kona side is all tourist. I doubt you can even spend one night in the walmark parking lot. The camp grounds have people all the time booked months or years in advance. The locals will TOTAL cars that have been rented or don't belong to locals if they are not where they should be.  Green sand beach, some of the local beachs on the hilo side etc.  There is a lot of stealing and bad neighborhoods, but also nicer places. There are a suprising amount of people who bought property then live on a 100 foot by 200 foot piece of land nomad or vandwelling style.  Water source is a concern. Power as well.  What are you going to do for work? some organic farms will pay you in food for work done but it won't be enough to live on.  My suggestion is if you have any volunteer experience go to the volcano nation park as a volunteer. You can go for 3 months, housing on their property. work 5 of the seven days.  otherwise I think its going to be an adventure.  I can't stress too much the local on non-local thing. its a love hate relationship they need the tourist dollars but hate the tourists.

I did just what you are planing to do, camped out at the lake, pulled my boat with it, it was my home away from home.. It came in very handy when I partied a little too hard. I traveled from northern Michigan to Key West, out across Texas and New Mexico and every where in between.. I went to Mexico but left my van in El paso.. Its all I owned so, I didn't want to lose it.. Back in the 70s we customized our own vans but now there are so many nice conversion vans left over from 90s that are pretty cheep...just pick one..

Cargo vans are better suited to insulate against outside temps. Find a van that is mechanically sound. Test drive, pay attention to the sounds, the feel of the ride. Take it to a mechanic if possible. All models have their particular quirks. How far will you be driving it? Full size vans get crappy gas mileage. How many friends will be sleeping in it with you? You could get away with a mini if it was just you and another friend, 3 tops, 5 if you really want to push personal space levels. I bought my last van for 1600. I think I got a good deal.

I'd also like a truck for ease of maintenance. I'm kinda leaning towards a truck and building a truck camper but obviously its hard to make these blend in as well as vans hence wondering if I could do some sort of 'interior stealth'."
vandwellers,32j06q,John-Garrison,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:32:30 2015 UTC,I started my build with interior stealth in mind but like half way through realized it wasn't going to happen right away. One day I may remove my desk/cabinets and give it a try. I'd like to hear from anyone who does this.
vandwellers,32j06q,Minivan2016,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm considering this as well. I'm not sure if stealth is practical with a truck camper, even if home-made. (A manufactured one is out of the question.) The only way to do it that I can imagine is to spring for some sort of smooth cladding (e.g. thin aluminum sheet), paint it white, and have no windows. Go for a commercial or industrial look."
vandwellers,32j06q,brutimus,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:24:46 2015 UTC,"but thats the thing with hiding yourself inside, the exterior stealth wouldnt matter thus allowing you to get away (in theory) with a normal looking truck camper.  I thought about making it look kind of industrial, but I think I want windows."
vandwellers,32j06q,brutimus,6,Wed Apr 15 18:09:17 2015 UTC,I personally wouldn't what people to be able to peek and see what's inside at all. Feels invasive and I'd be even more paranoid about tempting thieves.
vandwellers,32j06q,TheOriginalGoron,6,Tue Apr 14 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on how much stuff you have around, keeping the windows clear is something you can do to specifically deter thieves.  One vandweller I know makes a point of keeping his curtains open when he leaves the van. He makes sure everything is put away, the flat surfaces are bare, and in general it looks very spartan inside.  The idea is that thieves are less likely to break in if it looks like there isn't much to bother with. Utility vans and vans with blacked out windows seem to be broken into more often, as the thieves are left to simply imagine the possible haul.  Keeping the windows clear also makes the van less scary to people in general, and he's had less problems with cops bothering him since he started the ""nothing to hide"" policy."
vandwellers,32j06q,mrcryptic,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:13:37 2015 UTC,clear windows are definitely less scary. I've stopped putting up the relectix on my front side windows so people have a way to see through the van.
vandwellers,32j06q,TheOriginalGoron,3,Tue Apr 14 15:35:50 2015 UTC,if they can see inside they can tell if you live in there based on your et up
vandwellers,32j06q,mrcryptic,5,Tue Apr 14 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"I've sort of done this in the back of an SUV with a black sheet. I made a sort of teepee with the sheet suspended from the ceiling that then draped down around me. My car has tinted rear windows, but you can still see through them easily enough if there is light on the other side of the car. This method made it mostly look like it was a normal parked car, but gave me quite a bit of room to sleep inside."

vandwellers,32j06q,SkylarThomas,5,Tue Apr 14 20:13:39 2015 UTC,Or you could tape a picture of the inside of your van onto your windows.

I think that a prius would be great to travel in but I'm not sure how stealthy it would be to run the ac in an urban setting with the engine kicking in periodically to keep the charge up (I believe that's how it works)."
vandwellers,32j06q,BeccaGets,2,Tue Apr 14 21:02:55 2015 UTC,Yep it does kick in! Maybe if you added an extra battery it could keep it from kicking in as often? I'm not sure how hard that would be. I think it  only comes on for a couple of minutes to charge it... Maybe you could install some type of SUPER SILENT muffler so when it turns on it makes no noise? That would be great. I think those prius are pretty silent when the engine turns on... what are your thoughts on that?
vandwellers,32j06q,Dr_Mc_Coy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:17:23 2015 UTC,"The prius has an existing large bank of batteries so it's not a question of adding an ""extra battery"".  I don't think that would be practical.  Also I don't have a feel for how silent the recharge engine is but the muffler idea could be applied if there is an aftermarket automotive noise reduction muffler."
vandwellers,32j06q,small_e_900,2,Wed Apr 15 00:40:44 2015 UTC,Right I forgot that it had a large battery already. Wish there was an option for an even BIGGER battery. That could help.... or perhaps with the muffler alone we could get that going. I think the muffler idea is great. If I ever pick up a hybrid I will keep that in mind for sure.  At least from the times I have ridden a prius I don't really hear the engine kicking in that much.... Though that was inside... not sure on the outiside

The mid range extended model is ideal for space if you are also concerned about stealth. Particularly if you want to stay in urban areas.  I can literally park anywhere with it. Parking lots. Industrial areas. Residential areas. Apartment complexes. Outside of 24 hour gyms.   Edit: typos

I guess in a car might be difficult.  Electricity: you have a 120W inverter? Changing your phone on it, you can do all day. charging a laptop, you could probably get at least a good 50% battery before thinking about starting the car. I don't really care too much about my battery lasting. when it starts not holding charge I'll spend 150 bucks on a new one, no biggie. I don't expect this to happen very quickly at all although I try to go to a coffee shop or mcdonalds to charge my laptop.

Humidity/smell: I'm only at the 6 week mark so I can't comment on this. no damp smell so far although I'm currently in socal so i don't have to really worry about humidity.

As far as a cooler goes, get an insulated Igloo thing; buy ice and as the ice melts you'll have good tasting filtered water.  Replace as needed.  Instead of cooking, buy bulk foods; dried fruits, nuts, healthy munchies.  Treat yourself to a good restaurant meal once in a while if you can afford it; grapes, cheese and good bread make a great meal.  For a toilet, get the equivalent of a 'loveable loo', a bucket with a seat on top; don't use it unless you have to but it's nice to know it's there in a 3 am emergency.  To dry out the car, park it in the sun or partial shade with the windows cracked all around; the heat will dry things out.  A lot depends on your climate.  Avoid mold at all costs (caused by having the windows rolled up and all the breathing overnight or not cleaning enough).  Look at solar panels like the Yeti from GoalZero for your roof.

I had much worse sleeps, found I wasn't comfortable in some positions, I sweat more, and it developed leaks which i had to repair.  I crashed on a friend's couch recently and even that was a better sleep, and I just started sleeping on a proper mattress again and am sleeping infinitely better.

vandwellers,32egf0,zph0eniz,8,Mon Apr 13 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"I frequently sleep in the front seat of my car in Walmart parking lots. Only had an issue in Colorado Springs where the rent-a-cop kindly informed me that that particular Walmart didn't let people sleep overnight and then told me some place where I could crash. And I've never worried about privacy or hiding the fact. Just curl up in my sleeping bag, pull my hat over my eyes, go to sleep."
vandwellers,32egf0,hartfordsucks,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:32:14 2015 UTC,Good to know.  Had no idea they actually had a schedule for it.
vandwellers,32egf0,hartfordsucks,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"Apparently there's a list somewhere that says which Walmarts allow it but I'd just sleep there until someone tells you not to. It's a good sign if you get there and see a bunch of other trucks, campers/RVs and cars parked in the darker areas of the parking lot."
vandwellers,32egf0,cookieguy10,8,Tue Apr 14 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"Drinking a pull of scotch helps getting to sleep.  In seriousness,  Remember that 98% of people are not even aware that their might be some one sleeping in a car."
vandwellers,32egf0,WiretapStudios,5,Mon Apr 13 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"There is a list online of Wal-Marts you can park at. Most of the time there are other campers already there, just park over near those. I'd put up a sunscreen in the front and back in to a space with grass / etc beside it in the far corner near enough to a light to be secure but not enough to disturb sleep. You can get some side shades for the other windows if you want, they sell them online. Most aren't cheap so I'd make my own if I were you. Sleeping in the passenger side is def more comfortable, move the seat forward and it might let you recline further back. I can never get too comfortable in a car, so I have something I can put the rear seats down in and sleep longways on an inflatable mat. You might also want to crack a window for ventilation. Good luck!"

vandwellers,32egf0,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Apr 13 08:57:34 2015 UTC,Here is one way. Sit in driver's seat but have your legs on the passenger side. Not good? Build up the middle under your knees with whatever comes to mind. You can almost stretch out flat if you do it well.  Trying it is better for.conclusions than just thinking about it. Trial and error is how I did it.

vandwellers,32e5bv,IronColumn,6,Mon Apr 13 03:18:14 2015 UTC,"WHOA. Get it. I'd grab that for $1300. Only paid $300 more for mine but it's a Ford 06. That one is the same length of mine. More windows, already tinted. The seller is also using language like ""asking."" So offer $1100 or $1200."
vandwellers,32e5bv,Vanbruh,2,Mon Apr 13 02:25:19 2015 UTC,Should I pay to have a mechanic inspect it before buying it?
vandwellers,32e5bv,earthfront,3,Mon Apr 13 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you don't know what to check for, always get someone to look at it. A $100 pre-purchase inspection is better than a bad surprise, even at this price point.   Also, don't wait too long. I lost a van to someone who knew their stuff before I could get a mechanic to look at it."
vandwellers,32e5bv,WiretapStudios,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:59:11 2015 UTC,How do I go about getting someone to look at? Does the van need to go to a shop or can I ask a shop to come out and look at it? It looks like the van has been up for nearly a month now. I hope that's not a bad sign.
vandwellers,32e5bv,earthfront,2,Mon Apr 13 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"You need to take it to a shop so they can put it up on the lift and check under it as well. Also google lists online for what sounds to look for when driving it. If the seller balks at you taking it to a mechanic, it might be a bad sign."
vandwellers,32e5bv,ectish,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:59:51 2015 UTC,"Also, at least in my area there are mobile mechanics. They'll do a less vigorous check than a shop. But a shop is best. Ask for a ""Pre-Purchase Inspection""."
vandwellers,32e5bv,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"In Dallas, there's a company called Lemon Busters that came out to the car we were looking at."
vandwellers,32e5bv,vtjohnhurt,2,Mon Apr 13 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, but have your eyes open that this is a big gamble that offers only limited protection.  I recently bought a cherry 2004 with 115K miles and paid a dealer to inspect.  They missed several thousand dollars of expensive and important problems.  The vehicle was drivable around town, but it would have been foolish to take it on the road without fixing the problems.  I had the cash in reserve to make all of the repairs (about $5000 total).  I'm happy with the car.  It would resell for $8000 less than I have invested in it, but I plan to keep it for a long time.  (It's common to be 'under water' on a used car, having much more invested than the car is worth at resale.)  On the other hand the mechanic could have found the problems in the inspection and I would have gone into the deal with my eyes open and either walked away or gotten a better price.  But usually the seller will stick to the asking price and wait for a bigger sucker to come along to pay the asking price or maybe slightly less.  Right now, you have $1300 cash and good credit (usable credit cards).  You want to avoid ending up with $0, cancelled credit cards, and a broken down van.  If that happens you will be completely screwed.  If the van is drivable around town, and you can live in it, and you can use it to transportation to get to a JOB close by (a job that you could not hold without a vehicle), then it might be a gamble worth taking.  Save up your money and when you have $5000 in the bank and everything is fixed on the van, then you can think about traveling and/or reducing your hours/income to just meet your living expenses.  If you want to travel or work part time to just meet your living expenses every week, then I think you should have $1300 + $5000 in reserve.  If you're a good mechanic and have access to tools and a place to make repairs, then you might reduce the reserve to $3000.  It's a really bad idea to plan to use your credit cards to pay an unexpected repair bill, UNLESS you're holding a job that earns you much more than your living expenses.  As a rule of thumb, you should have the income that allows you to completely pay off your credit cards in three months.  You also need to carry insurance to get plates in most states.  Lots of people dig themselves into a hole with their credit cards.  Don't be dumb.  If you want to live frugally and work as little as possible, then you should try to keep your credit card balance at $0."
vandwellers,32e5bv,Vanbruh,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks man that's all very solid advice.  I'm in a good situation right now, still living at home for free. I have a full time though min wage and no real bills. currently between cars though and being a burden having to share my mom's. The credit card plan was only if something immediately broke. Otherwise I plan on just using the cash I get from the job to slowly fix anything and then save up a emergency fund and then I can move out."
vandwellers,32e5bv,Scatter_Stash,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"It actually makes sense to buy the van now if you're living at home if you have a place to park it if it is broken down for a while.  Try to NOT use the credit card to finance repairs.  Better to do without the van for a while.  On the other hand it is problematic to have a broken down vehicle.  I cannot emphasize enough the freedom that comes with having an 'emergency fund' in the bank and zero balance on credit cards.  As soon as you have credit card debt, you become a true 'wage slave'.  You will not know what you own until you start using it and sorting out the things that don't seem quite right.  So your plan to have the van and live at home is a good one.  You can buy a set of tools and make basic repairs yourself.  It is too expensive to pay someone to fix all the little things that go wrong.  Plus you'll want to get it really clean.  My advice is to fix everything  and get it in optimal shape and develop some 'pride of ownership'.  That way you will be motivated to keep pouring money into it (which makes sense if it is not rusty and you're able to keep it for the long haul).  If a vehicle has a lot of little problems, you'll start thinking about selling it at a loss and spending more money on something nicer.  The way to keep your total cost down is to hold onto it for a long long time.  Don't worry about the gas mileage.  Gas is a small part of the total cost of ownership.  If you're living at home, you can save a lot of money by adding the van to your mom's insurance and having her listed as the principle driver.  Get some advice from your insurance agent about the best way to set things up to get the lowest rate.  Just get liability insurance and drive carefully.   If you're living in the van and  you keep your mom's house as your permanent address for a while, you may be able to keep the van on her insurance.  If your mom has a relatively new car with collision insurance, it will be cheap to add the van to her insurance.  The insurance company figures that she is using the van some of the time.   If you get your own insurance it will be really expensive because of your age and lack of a long record as a safe driver.  Don't get any accidents or DUIs or you will find that insurance becomes unaffordable.  Good luck with the van!  It is a really fun vehicle to have when you're young and don't mind roughing it."
vandwellers,32e5bv,dying_to_be_vain,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch. You seem to be very like minded to myself, about not wanting to be a wage slave, and fixing the little things myself.   It is indeed a lot cheaper to be on my mom's insurance. I was paying around $110 a month when I had a car. When she added me for her insurance, for 6 months it was only like 300 more than she was paying before.  Do you live in a vam yourself currently?

vandwellers,32ejdl,goatsarekindacool,8,Mon Apr 13 03:30:00 2015 UTC,http://www.reddit.com/r/vandwellers/comments/2o80a3/vandwelling_faqs_resources_and_common_questions/
vandwellers,32ejdl,_Zeppo_,5,Mon Apr 13 04:15:51 2015 UTC,This kind gentleman has just linked our FAQ for this subreddit read it and then come back and us questions.
vandwellers,32ejdl,cookieguy10,7,Mon Apr 13 04:37:45 2015 UTC,"i'll take a crack at the list:  1)  a few grand should get you a road-ready vehicle.  I'm in Canada but my understanding is that in the US cars/vans are comparably priced, if not a little cheaper.  you'll have to do your homework on this one and perhaps consult someone who has more experience with purchasing vehicles (re: what to look/look out for).  Cruise craigslist or autotrader or whatever other resources there are for buying/selling used cars in the states.  Otherwise, i would say there are no special ways to get a van as compared to buying any other vehicle.  2) unfortunately there is no solid answer to this question.  It really will depend on how self-sufficient you need to be, how flexible you are with your levels of comfort, and what your priorities are.  If you need a vehicle with a self-contained kitchen/bathroom setup, pre-installed sleeping area, and you need it to be 100% mechanically reliable for years to come and you cannot do any maintenance on it yourself, you can expect to pay a lot of money for that (>5-10 thousand dollars).  If you can be happy with a basic sleeping platform and some foam padding, cook on a campstove, be creative with bathing and washroom needs, and do some basic maintenance on your vehicle yourself, you can likely find something in the 1-5 thousand dollar range (again, i am speaking from a different market so that might vary).  Generally speaking, i think ""camper vans"" are more expensive than minivans or cargo vans. So if you want to be thrifty, you can buy a minivan and get creative with the setup.  I bought a 1991 Toyota Previa for $1200, cut down a wood futon frame i found in someone's trash, put it on milk crates, threw down a memory foam sleeping pad, cooked on a propane stove, etc etc.  That vehicle lasted a few years with minimal mechanical upkeep.  3) this is up to you, i would kit it out for life as a van dweller, then go on an adventure, find a new career, who knows.  My van dwelling began when i started working seasonally as a treeplanter and lived out of the van several months out of the year and for the rest of the year would either bop around working here and there or park it and pay for a few months rent.    4) again, this is entirely up to you.  get creative.  I'm new to this subreddit but i'll bet there are some great ideas if you look around here.  I found that fruit nets, hanging shoe cubbies, auction-sale leftover furniture, reflective bubble sheet insulation, peel and stick velcro, plastic tote bins, folding lawn furniture, rubber-bottomed door mats, and a national parks pass (among other things) were necessities.  5) firstly, insurance, then fuel (which will vary depending on where you go), then expenses such as parking (will depend on where you go) and food, etc.   A young person such as yourself would pay a lot for insurance in Canada.  I cannot speculate re: the costs in the US but I watch american tv and i know there are a lot of companies that would love to have you call or email them to find out how they can save you x% or more.  fuel and food you can calculate based on your mileage and what you like to eat/how much.  Other things you might get depending on where you are living in your van include gym passes (cleaning needs), etc.  6) have a FRIEND along?  this is an EXCELLENT question.  when you say ""friend"" do you mean ""buddy"" or ""significant other""?. remember that you will be spending a LOT of time with this person, likely sharing a bed with them, they might have to drive your vehicle and you will be relying on them to respect your home and help you make it all work.  Living in close quarters like that can put strain on a relationship or bring the two of you closer together, and predicting which it will be is likely impossible, although it is probably going to be one way or the other.  I think if both parties are fairly easy-going, self-sufficient, creative, and not particularly stubborn, you've got a shot.  Another thing to consider on a road trip is ""do i trust this person to drive my van safely?""  There will likely be adversity, adventure, and the need for compromise.  Consider your van-life partner carefully.  7)  I am assuming you mean ""how far will it go total?"" as opposed to ""how far will it go on a tank of gas?"" (the latter question depending on the model/engine size/mechanical condition).  You can buy a used vehicle which will run for thousands of kms with very little input required, or will go for a half a day before a vital component breaks down, resulting in thousands of dollars in required maintenance.  Getting a reliable vehicle is possible, i would recommend learning about the different models and how they deteriorate with age (lots of site with owner reviews online), what to look for in a used vehicle, and pay a little money (1-2 hundred bucks) to get the vehicle checked out by a mechanic before purchase.  The seller may try to persuade you the last step is unnecessary, this may be a bad sign.   8) answered already below  9)  i find the costs to be substantially cheaper.  insurance is typically cheaper than mortgage payments or rent, and other bills are N/A.    10) this is a tricky one that is covered prolifically throughout this sub.  If you NEED electricity it is possible to have electricity but can increase costs or your reliance on facilities such as RV parks.  I would charge my laptop or rechargeable batteries for headlamps here and there in coffee shops or mooch electricity off places with outdoor sockets, etc.  you may find your need to have electricity isn't as great as you initially anticipated, or find solutions to this problem.  If you choose to get an inverter (a device which one end plugs into your cigarette lighter and the other end is a regular socket) the problem you run into is  (other than the fact that they are inefficient) typically that it will drain your battery and potentially cause you to be stranded.  not the end of the world, but i find they aren't worth having.  11) Around where I was typically using my vehicle there was no shortage of woods and logging roads that you could just drive up and stay for free.  As soon as you get into urban areas (again, this is a subject covered extensively on this sub) things get a little more complex.  This is especially true in places like surf towns or tourist towns where police and by-law officials are used to seeing people trying to sneakily stay the night.  try to keep your vehicle subtle or (if it's a cargo van) a great trick a friend of mine used was to get decals made with the name of a fake contracting company...  so it looks like it's an electrician's vechicle or something.  won't always work, but who knows.  Otherwise if i was in a city i could always count on Wal Mart parking lots if I was too tired to look for something more appealing, or fleabag motel parking lots also usually work for some reason.  Generally if overnight parking is legal, you can stay the night, but if you stick around too long it usually will end in you being asked to leave, or ticketed.  i find national parks are also great places to be a van-dweller.    12)  water is a variable you have to account for (like several we've already mentioned, and some we have probably forgotten) in a manner you likely aren't used to yet, but you will adapt.  you'll find places to fill up and the best amounts/containers for your vehicle and lifestyle.  keep these things clean and treat it like fuel. for me living in a van made me appreciate the value of water from a tap.  13) As far as I'm concerned, it was an amazing experience.  I am writing this for you because I am so fond of reflecting on my time living my van lifestyle and I would be lying if i said that I don't miss it fairly regularly.  It's a simpler life that you'll find a lot of people don't understand and would have you believe is an inferior lifestyle when compared with the status quo.  In fact I believe living in a van can broaden your horizons and enrich your life.  It can save you money as well.  The way I approached life for about a decade was:  If I can't fit my whole life in a van, I've got problems.  I still try to live by that, and I guess the idea there is that living in a van enabled me to be adaptable and move on a whim.    At any rate, that's a huge answer, I know...  TL,DR:  Comb through this sub for ideas, get creative, be flexible, have fun, drive safely, and report back."

vandwellers,32ejdl,DazarGaidin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:51:38 2015 UTC,"I too live in the Bay Area and I just bought a van off CL. Van hunting was tricky. California seems to want to get over value for their vans. I finally found a 1989 Dodge that I'm happy with. I am staying locally so I have ample time to make it road worthy. My first task is covering the windows so no one can look in. I've done research online and on this site to get suggestions. I next will remove the middle bench seat for extra floor space. I bought a portable toilet (Just in case!) and am combing CL freebies for futons, and other things that will help. I'm not too concerned with much more than this. I have a full-time job so I just really need a place to sleep. I got a jet pack for wireless. My expenses are gas, food, gym, storage, parking (maybe), phone/wireless and insurance. I am guessing this will all amount to around $700 per month with is less than what I am paying on a room in a house. I have an older van so the mileage is low but van typically get crappy gas mileage. You don't need a special license just a class C. You will save money. This is why I am doing it, especially if you stay in California. Because you are 18 your insurance will be high. You are going to want to strategize your finances so that you don't default on this. If you decide to relocate you can live much more affordable. Parking is tricky but lots of great resources on the internet. The best advice is to stay in busy areas if you are urban camping and don't sleep in front of peoples houses. You can also sleep at rest stops, truck stops. As for experience you can loose doing something that is possibly difficult for you or challenging. I wouldn't hesitate. I hope this  helps. Feel free to ask me more if you like."

vandwellers,32evgv,DazarGaidin,-1,Tue Apr 14 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"Dumb idea.  Get a rail/bus pass instead. http://www.amtrak.com/rail-passes  It is very unlikely that you can buy/use/sell a used vehicle for a few months and not lose a lot of money.  As the price of the vehicle drops, your chances of coming out even get worse (but a total loss is less painful).  Used cars break down frequently.  Most have hidden problems when you buy them.  If you have $20,000 to buy a very low mileage vehicle from a private seller, you might break even after owning it for a few months.  The only way to win on a vehicle (new or used) is to own them for many years and get some benefit out of owning them.  Of course, you could be extremely lucky and your plan will work.  Not at all likely though."
vandwellers,32evgv,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"I never said I plan on breaking even, my hopes are to buy a cheap car and possibly sell it for a couple hundred dollars less once I am done with it."
vandwellers,32evgv,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"If you buy a cheap car, you can pretty much count on putting money into it right away.  This is because almost all cheap cars have hidden problems or develop problems quickly as you use them.   Sometimes the cost of fixing the first problem is a few hundred dollars.  So you spend it.  Then you have a few more problems like this and spend another $1000-2000.  Or you abandon the car.  Even worse is the hidden potentially deadly problem.  A few years ago, I was your age driving a cheap van across the country.  When I got to Nevada, a service station manager pointed out the big 'bites' out of my tire treads.  The shocks were bad on the van and the tires were old.  When it hit a bump, the tire would lose a big chunk of tread.  The hot Nevada blacktop made the problem worse.  It was only a matter of time until a tire blew out and I careened off the road. I knew shit about tires and shocks, but the missing chunks of tread were obvious once they were pointed out to me.  So I shelled out for four new shocks and four new tires.  While the work was being done, the service station manager told me that his son had been killed in a car accident the previous year and that was why he took the trouble to check my tires."
vandwellers,32evgv,neonbible47,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I just bought a van for $1600, which was a steal, and then promptly had put another $700 into it for mechanical stuff just to be totally sure its road worthy. If you're dead set on this idea, just see what you can find and keep your fingers crossed that it doesn't break down mid-trip.  I have to agreed with others though. It seems like a pretty expensive way to spend 2 weeks. Also, are you going to register and insure it?"

A rebuild is about $1,000. I'd have a competent mechanic give it a good look over, with special attention to ball  joints, transmission (look at and smell the fluid), and other known wear points.  I'd have the mechanic come up with a list of concerns, and the cost to make them right, then go back to the seller and start working the price down.   I recently bought a Jayco camper van,  that is a 1992 Dodge B250 base, and I totally love it. I paid $1600 for mine. One advantage that the 1992 and later Dodges have is multiport injection, which give you about 30 more horsepower, and better mileage."

The transaction moved quicker than this thread, I actually sealed the deal on Tuesday and am now the proud owner! Got it down to $4k.

Chrysler transmissions seem to be made out of glass, most of them dont last until 170k. That being said, it is possible the tranny in this van will last much longer if it has been taken care of and hasnt been abused towing. You might be able to use that in a negotiation, but either way be sure to have enough money for a transmission replacement if you buy it. Nothing worse than a truck that runs great but wont move :P"

Google says this has an US R-Value of 3.5. Due to the fairly square shape of the Sprinter I've seen people use Kingspan (foil backed foam board), which this also has a US R-value of 7."
vandwellers,32cof3,64mb,3,Sun Apr 12 20:31:36 2015 UTC,"Edit: I watched the video.  The kit that you show will deliver at a MUCH slower rate than what is shown in the video.  Those kits are designed for sealing gaps.  I recommend the blue board + expanding foam at gaps approach.  This is a cargo space in the video and so they are not concerned with leaving the foam exposed.  This will be very warm and it will eliminate any possibility of condensation where the foam is sprayed.  Fire and ignition are a concern.  When polyfoam burns it produces deadly cases.  You can buy fire-retardant formulas, but in any case the foam should not be left exposed in an occupied space.  I've used a kit just like this to seal air leaks in new building construction.  You need to wear full protective gear.  A pair of tyvek overalls with a hood will do plus gloves and a face shield and a respirator.  Do it outside in the shade and open all doors and windows.  Set up a big fan if possible.  Urethane foam will stick to anything (including skin).  Use a drop cloth.  Be careful working overhead and position yourself so that it does not drip on you (though your body should be completely covered.)  The tanks will not completely empty and they will be hazardous waste so try to dispose of them properly.  Another approach which is cheaper and probably easier is to tack up blueboard foam with dots of adhesive and then use small cans of expanding foam to fill in around the edges and get an airtight seal.  Use a sharpened 3"" putty knife to trim off the foam flush."
vandwellers,32cof3,vtjohnhurt,3,Sun Apr 12 22:22:28 2015 UTC,Make sure not to over-fill small areas.  Also you should look into spray foam warping the sides of these vans.  From what I've read on the sprinter-source there is an issue with the heat generates warping the sides of the metal.    I've also read that you should still put in sound deadening panels and run any wires in the walls you might want before doing the foam.
vandwellers,32cof3,tinneydu,2,Sun Apr 12 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"I think you'd not have to worry about warping if you are only applying it 1"" thick at a time.

vandwellers,32cof3,crockett5,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:53:02 2015 UTC,To expand on crockett5's answer - CLOSED cell foam means it won't wick water from condensation.  OPEN cell foam wicks water everywhere and leads to mold and mildew problems at least and serious unseen rust problems at worst.

I add nuts and dried fruit to the muesli to fortify it (make it taste better).  It is important to drink water when eating dry muesli.  I have to be careful and not eat too much.  Usually I limit myself to two large mouthfuls of muesli per day otherwise digestive problems.  You need a funnel to fill the jar.  Get a widemouth drink bottle where the mouth fits into the jar.  Cut off the bottom of the bottle.  You now have a funnel.  A typical breakfast is two mouthfuls of muesli, two mouthfuls of nuts/fruit, one or two fresh fruits (bananas, oranges, apples), a boiled egg or mozarella stick, coffee or water.  An easy dinner is a good quality soup, add maybe 10 spoonfuls instant brown rice and cook for 10 minutes. Or use instant white rice.  Tortillas last a long time.  Peanut butter makes a good tortilla filling. Add some sambal oelek to make it hot.  Take a can of vegetables (green beans, mixed veggies or whatever), including the liquid. Put it in a pot.

The reason is that high-power 12 V loads (e.g. non-thermoelectric refrigerator, 100W radio transmitter) draw a high current, because the supply voltage is low. This is okay in theory; however high-current 12 V wiring is much more troublesome (stiff cables, awkward plugs, stray inductance) and requires thicker cables because the current is high. If the high-current load is located far from the battery, and the cables are too narrow and consequently have high resistance, much power will be lost in heating the wires. (I have noticed this myself running just 200W cigarette-lighter inverters.)  In summary: 12 V power is appropriate for low power loads, but high-power loads introduce complication. It might help if you listed your planned loads?"

The first list of air-filtering plants was compiled by NASA as part of a clean air study published in 1989.    which researched ways to clean air in space stations. As well as absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, as all plants do, these plants also eliminate significant amounts of benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene. The second and third list are from B. C. Wolverton's book  and paper  and focus on removal of specific chemicals.  NASA researchers suggest efficient air cleaning is accomplished with at least one plant per 100 square feet of home or office space.  Other research has shown that micro-organisms in the potting mix (soil) of a potted plant remove benzene from the air, and that some plant species also contribute to removing benzene.

vandwellers,32a8mm,stlfreak,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:39:11 2015 UTC,how do you get a model of the van into sketchup to start designing things? i remember some website with a database of models but they weren't very detailed or accurate.
vandwellers,32a8mm,Buckiller,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"Thingiverse has a gazillion models, it's likely there's something to use as a starting point."
vandwellers,32a8mm,wigglebump,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:43:15 2015 UTC,Looks like the models are specific to 3D printers? It may be a while longer before we can print a van.
vandwellers,32a8mm,pseudo_mccoy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:43:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I have yet to see a scale-accurate 3D model of a van on any of the free 3d model sites. So if you really want to design to scale, you'll probably have to create the model yourself.   I'm pretty lazy. I probably wouldn't want to spend the time on that. So, my advice is to take simple measurements of the interior compartment of the van, like overall length, overall height, and overall width, and just model within that space. The other issue with a full 3D model of the whole van is that you'll spend a lot of time turning the visibility of the walls on and off since it'll be difficult to design with them in the way. I think in Sketchup you can make them transparent and lock certain layers, but still, to me it's kind of an unnecessary pain in the butt."
vandwellers,32a8mm,defyingnormal,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:14:05 2015 UTC,"Good point, but it wouldn't be too hard given a little SketchUp knowledge.

vandwellers,329okz,flux8,5,Sat Apr 11 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"I think the VWs are popular because most of the ones you see came that way from the factory. Honda and Toyota never imported (or probably even made) camper vans. If you can do your own work, I would highly recommend one of those over just about anything else (unless you needed a ton of space).  For me, gas mileage was the most important consideration too, so I went with a 1st generation Odyssey, with the 4 cylinder and without the transmission problems the 2nd generation ones had. While not fast by any stretch of the imagination, it's faster than the average VW and MUCH more reliable. I've put 34k miles on it and averaged 28mpg.   The downside is that you have a lot less interior space to work with than with a full sized van or a VW, but most of my aforementioned miles were with my daughter and there is enough room for the two of us to be comfortable. You just have to put a lot of thought into your design."

Then start working on the interior of the Odyssey and testing it out while I still have a house and job.  It will be fun trying it out by going out to the Oregon coast (I'm in Portland) and seeing if I can comfortably live in it with my dog for a week or so.

My setup seems standard for minivans--remove all the rear seats, add a full size bed and build a kitchen in the back. I have a platform that allows me to store things under the bed, although I sometimes prefer to go without for more headroom. I use a very simple shelf setup for a kitchen, made out of a Ikea tv stand.   If you go this route I would highly recommend a Thule or Yakima roof box. I have the biggest one Yakima makes.

Like, what other option would you have than to sleep it off in your vehicle if you weren't living in your van but you couldn't afford a cab home? My family's business is near a bar, so tipsy drivers sometimes pull out of the parking lot, realize they can't make it home, and pull right into the company lot.

Since it was readily mobile with only a turn of the ignition key and was “stationary in a place not regularly used for residential purposes, temporary or otherwise,” it was a “licensed motor vehicle subject to a range of police regulations inapplicable to a fixed dwelling.” The motorhome, in this case, was considered a vehicle and the legality of the original search was upheld.

When I mounted the panels on my old Westy, I used the standard ""Z"" bracket which all the solar dealers sell. I attached that to a piece of aluminum angle which was about 1"" 1/2 . I then bolted the angle to the actual solar panels to make sort of a roof rack out of the panels them selves.   I think I had a total of 6 Z brackets which each were bolted directly to the roof. I used standard stainless hurricane shutter screws to hold them in place because those screws have a very big flat head.   Never had any issues with leaking or them coming loose."

vandwellers,3254eo,CatBawx,2,Sun Apr 12 03:15:04 2015 UTC,First its fiber glass and most likely not painted. The color is in what is called the gel coat. DONT sand through that t protects the fiberglass. If you want to paint it just suff up the gel with fine grit sand paper. Don't use Rustolem. it has a fish oil base. Use a auto base and finish coat.
vandwellers,3254eo,Vincentvancow,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if Rustoleum is needed since its fiberglass and not metal? I'm no expert here, but it was a thought I had. Also, don't go to deep on the sanding - seeing as its fiberglass - be sure to wear a breathing mask rated for fiberglass particles.  Just be sure to add some clear coat to it to protect the paint and do some wet sanding in between coats.  As far as what type of paint to use...I'm not positive, but I imagine marine / automotive paints will be your best bet. Boats are commonly made of fiberglass and I'm sure they offer a strong resistance to the elements."

You'd need a reliable 1000+ watt energy source.  solar+battery, campground plugin, gas generator, etc.   There's really no other way around this."
vandwellers,321vvl,banned_1_time,2,Fri Apr 10 08:59:33 2015 UTC,"This is interesting because I also am considering keeping my reptiles with me, if I can convince myself that it's practical.  I optimistically estimate the power needs for my gecko and turtle to be 100 W of 120 V AC loads for 12 hours per day, which works out to 125 Ah of charge at 10.4 A of current in a 12 V DC system, including 80% inverter efficiency.  That's just on the edge of what I'd consider easy to achieve, although my grasp of the practicalities of portable power systems is limited. It seems that you'd need at least 250 Ah of charge capacity to keep the depth of discharge low, for example maybe two or three 100 Ah deep cycle batteries to  spread out the current drain. If you're charging only with solar and you've got, say, 8 hours of sunlight and your panels put out say, 70 % of rated power, then you're going to need roughly 275 W worth of panels. (I don't know how to figure out the charging capability of a vehicle's alternator; suggestions are welcome.)  A quick glance at prices on solartrader.ca shows ~$275 for a single panel of the reqired size, and ~$600 for a 300 Ah battery. I don't yet know how to calculate the requirements for the charge controller and inverter, so that's a wildcard at the moment.  Again, seems do-able, but not trivial. As always, frugality in energy useage is probably going to pay off the most, so decreasing the animals' heat needs through insulation is probably worth it."
vandwellers,321vvl,Fraog,2,Sat Apr 11 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"Vehicle's alternator is controlled by the car computer. The ratings on it are max ratings, usually 70-150a, but it's not what it's going to charge at unless there's a totally dead battery. That's why it's a bad idea to rely on the alternator soley; to get a fully topped out battery, which is necessary for good battery health, it takes hours at trickle charging with the engine on. That's where solar comes in. On my 300ah battery bank with solar, when i'm running the engine, it'll do anywhere from 10-30a."
vandwellers,321vvl,Van-van,2,Sat Apr 11 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"Maxxfan with automatic temperature control @ 75F (can be left running in the rain). Webasto or Espar D2 heater with D1000 controller with automatic temperture control if you have diesel. A propex propane heater (not sure if it has automatic temp control) if you don't. High quality reflective thermal window covers. Big battery bank (200-300aH 12V DC) for dependability and decent solar panels to power it (100-300w riskier to safer). Drive to somewhere with nice weather.   If you do all these things, and aren't leaving them for long periods, it's perfectly feasible. The heating isn't a problem, but hot weather is and you'll have to drive somewhere higher/drier/cooler."

I saw someone did the side of their side door footwell which seemed like a good spot. Use a hole saw and cover them with mesh to keep out bugs and a closeable vent. This combined with the fan will provide cooler air flowing through the van."

Plug into Van battery.  If you're full time, you might invest in a combination battery like http://www.optimabatteries.com/en-us/products/yellowtop that allows deep discharge without damage.  You can also get a controller from an RV accessory seller that will disconnect the battery once it reaches a partial discharge point (that way you have enough charge to restart).  This scheme assumes that you drive the van enough to recharge the battery.  The charge state of the battery is easy to monitor with a voltmeter.  A fully charged '12V' battery will typically measure 14.4 volts.  You can get a graph for your particular battery that will tell you the charge state depending on the voltage.  Also possible to put in a second battery that you isolate from the starter battery.  WRT the dog.  A warm insulated bed might be enough.

No throttling, only $29.99/mo for unlimited internet from here on out. There are also options for LTE antennas on the market for the Unite.  If you're more interested in going off of WiFi a lot of people here get dedicated WiFi antennas to pick up signals from further away and join open networks or simply stop at coffee shops.

vandwellers,321ob8,ShawnS4363,2,Wed Apr 15 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, you can tether your phone to your laptop. US carriers will try to charge you extra for the privilege of sharing data you've already paid for, but there are ways around that.  I pay $70/mo to t-mobile for unlimited voice and 4g lte data. Of course they offer a hotspot service on the side, but that's just greedy so I use a popular custom rom called cyanogenmod that doesn't rat on tethering usage. On a stock phone (w/o cyanogenmod) unlimited data would reach my phone, but t-mobile would block me from passing it to my laptop unless I give them more money.  If this is something you're interested in, I think there are easier ways to do this. Like, I don't think you need to flash a rom to do this anymore. What kind of phone do you have?"

vandwellers,31zuda,Persona_Transplant,3,Fri Apr 10 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"I live in the PNW so I'm pretty familiar with the moisture and condensation issue. I'm not sure what climate you're in, but if it's anywhere humid, you might not want to use you're propane heater if you're worried about condensation. The burning propane creates water which will make your van into a greenhouse inside and mold could become an issue. Also, if you're worried about moisture, try to find somewhere not inside your van to hang your wet things (or don't get wet) because this also makes the moisture issue worse. Ventilation will help too. Ideally you'd want to crack some windows or a roof vent.  I have been having a hard time with this when I'm here in the spring and fall (I leave for Arizona in winter). I'm super paranoid about toxic mold growing in the walls of my van between the intricate wood paneling, the insulation and the van walls as I have no way to check behind there (I know, I know, it might not have been the best design now that I realize this). Last fall I was using my Mr. buddy heater in here and it started to get unbelievably wet in here. Mold was growing on the side of my roof vent and around the windows and on my curtains. I didn't think about the burning propane water vapor thing. So this spring I am hooked up to shore power (which I realize isn't an option for everyone) and I continuously run the Davis Air Dryer and at night I use a small electric oil heater (similar to this one). I also bought this product called hypervent, which is a kind of plastic mat that is made to put under the mattress to allow air circulation and prevent moisture under the mattress. This was a major problem for me, as every morning there would be almost a puddle under my mattress from the condensation of my body heat and I was worried it would make the mattress moldy. Now that I'm doing all of this, my moisture issues seem to be mostly solved, but it's still a battle. What I've learned is that living in a van in a rainforest isn't the greatest thing overall.   I also don't use a fridge. I keep all my vegetables in a loosely closed plastic bag in the storage area under my bed (it's cooler under there). I try not to buy more than a few days worth at a time, otherwise they will go moldy. Fruits last longer and I just keep them out in a bowl. Eggs do not need to be refrigerated, but if I have them more than a week I'll give them the old smell test, haha. I use powdered milk. Tofu can be bought in those sealed tetrapacks that don't need to be refrigerated until you open them. I'm not vegetarian, but I don't cook with meat or fish inside my van, so I don't worry about that. I haven't had an issue with bugs, but then, it's not very buggy here. All my dry goods like rice, pasta, oatmeal etc. I keep in recycled yogurt and ice cream containers so they're sealed and no bugs can get in.  Best of luck! I hope some of that is helpful.  Edit: switched halfway through from phone to computer"
vandwellers,31zuda,positive_pangolin,3,Thu Apr 9 17:01:08 2015 UTC,"I live in my 1998 GMC 3500 which has no paneling inside. It's just bare painted white metal with a roof vent. The roof vent works pretty well for letting hear escape but I experience condensation on the ceiling of the van each morning. Since I can see the surface I can also see mold start to grow on the ceiling and the only solution that I have which is t really, is to wipe it down with Clorox wipes every month or so. I'm highly sensitive to mold and I never have any symptoms of allergy to the mold because it's firmly attached to the paint. The mold that starts to grow looks like black spots that slowly get larger and darker over time. Once I wipe it down it stays gone for a while. I don't really have a solution. Sorry."
vandwellers,31zuda,Solarnynja,2,Fri Apr 10 01:54:26 2015 UTC,"Condensation: I've only dealt with condensation from cooking in a very cold van but I just mopped it up with a towel.  Food: get a cooler or stick to cans. Hard cheeses and eggs don't need to be refrigerated either as long as you wrap the cheese well and only buy what you'll eat in a week or so. As long as your food is contained and your trash is thrown away promptly you shouldn't have many if any bugs to deal with.  Organization: This will always be a struggle. Some like totes while others prefer bags. I keep my clothes in a laundry hamper. One for dirty and one for clean. Then again, I wear the same basic outfit all week long. Maybe decide what you absolutely need to have and donate the rest? Wet stuff: My mini-bus is so big I have just put my wet stuff on the bottom step til it dries. Maybe a shallow tote without a lid will help? IDK, I'm spoiled with my vansion.  I hope that helps and if you need/want any more observations or advice I'll be happy to help as much as I can."

vandwellers,31zuda,BigMatteson,3,Thu Apr 9 13:42:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Rubbermaid containers, I guess? We always called them totes in my house. They're pretty cheap at the discount stores or Wally world and they come in so many different sizes you can literally create your own storage scheme. The danger is using totes that are too deep and forgetting what's in the bottom or worse, never using what's in the bottom. If you haven't used it in a month you probably don't need it and should consider losing it."

vandwellers,31zuda,positive_pangolin,2,Thu Apr 9 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"I also live in a humid area... Vancouver, BC. Condensation is an issue up here as well. From what I have read there are some key things to do:   Ventilation... as much as possible without losing too much heat. Calcium chloride... absorbs moisture. Can be bought in the form of road salt. Build your bed frame with slats underneath or holes drilled thru the bed platform so moisture cannot accumulate 1600BTUs of propane heat produces 2 ounces or 67 millilitres of water in the air per hour. I bought a Wave 3 propane heater and will be experimenting with it in terms of how much moisture is in the van with that heater. If there is too much I will buy a vented propane heater such as the Dickenson Newport P9000... super expensive, but will keep the van bone dry. One other important thing... insulation. When warm air hits a cold surface like metal, condensation forms. What I am doing is putting up 2 inches of rigid foamboard insulation and covering that with a vapor barrier (thick plastic sheet). Not only should this limit heat loss from having all the ventilation, but it should allow me to use less propane heat... thus create less moisture.  Thats the plan anyway. I'll find out how well it works in a few months when I move in fulltime."

Your posts and overuse of jargon tells me that you might be overthinking your vehicle choice. Didn't you just pick up your van? If you did I would hang on to it for awhile. You will end up losing money if you get out of it too soon. You might also find that you enjoy the extra space a full size van offers over a minivan. If you did switch I would venture to say you would still get significantly less than the advertised miles per gallon because of the weight your carrying. Just my .02"

I honestly don't know the differences of the foams but I do know they make some which is more firm than others.   I think to solve this issue, you need to glue two different foam pads together..

vandwellers,31ungy,OzzyHere,2,Wed Apr 8 07:52:24 2015 UTC,"It is a good deal. The fact that it was a delivery van for short distances is a bit of a downside, in that it might have been worked harder than something with similar miles that spent more time on the highway. But as long as it seems to run ok when you see it, I wouldn't worry much about that.  But check for more rust! Seriously, get on your back and wiggle around all underneath, looking closely.  My first van was a '93 Ford 150, which was used for deliveries in Denver (not a humid place). And yet, there was extensive enough rust that the frame broke while I was going down the road! I didn't notice the rust when I bought the van just 6 months prior, because I only poked my head around the bottom edges instead of crawling under."
vandwellers,31ungy,John-Garrison,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"That's a good deal, I paid 1000 for a 1994 with more miles. If you don't mind the windows and color I'd say go for it. Rust might be an issue, mine didn't have a lot of rust. Yours might be located in a humid place.   The e150s are nice because they are very reliable, very common and easy to service. You see so many of them on the road because they stand the test of time.   Think about it, that's a 20 year old vehicle!   Rust is a huge problem if left untreated, it can ruin your brake lines and all sorts of other bad stuff.   One reason I got the van I did and not a Chevy (which were the most common types I found) was it seemed the chevys all had a lot of rust. Like often times the whole floor would be rusted over.   I'd make sure the rust isn't too much of an issue,  pay 1000 for it, and be happy."

I bought a 1973 Dodge van for $300 with some unknown but >100k number of miles (5-digit odometer) and subsequently used it as a delivery vehicle, daily driver, and house for two years. It broke down every so often, but never in such a way that I couldn't fix it in the street. It helped that I'm an experienced Mopar mechanic.  I wouldn't buy certain vans for living in. I wouldn't try it in a Chrysler minivan or a Chevy Astro, because the latter is too hard to work on and the former has a weak engine (the 2.2 4 cylinder, not the 3.0 Mitsubishi v6, which has its own problems but has a better reputation for durability.)"

vandwellers,31sjcb,warm_n_toasty,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:38:40 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on where you are. I made the recommendations I did assuming the United States, but you might not be so easily able to get parts for a Chrysler 318 in Europe, where I suspect OP might be. The small-block Chevy 350, on the other hand, is probably as ubiquitous an American engine as exists. Even though GM doesn't manufacture it any more (since 1997 or so there's a new small block, the LT series, which is different from the old one) there are many small companies still making parts for it. If you're in the States you shouldn't have any difficulty finding parts for the Ford 351 (Cleveland or Manchester, both of which I've found in vans) or Chevy or Chrysler small-blocks. There's no difference I've found in van engines vs. pickup-truck engines, so that helps.  As I mentioned, I ran a 1973 Dodge van for several years, and it was dead easy getting parts for that rig.   As to the Astro vans, they are made in such a way that, according to the Chilton manual I looked at when contemplating a transmission repair, the body needs to be jacked up off the frame in order to gain access to transmission-to-engine mounting bolts. I hate that stuff, so I begged off working on the van. On another occasion I had to replace a serpentine belt on the unit, and it was a lot harder than it needed to be as there were fixtures in the way. This was a late-1980s or early-1990s model (I don't remember exactly, because it's been over a decade since I saw this machine last) and it's entirely possible that accessibility may have changed for the better over time."
vandwellers,31sjcb,CodySmash,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:23:59 2015 UTC,sweet thanks for the reply. I was put off by getting one of those old vans because I thought parts for them would be drying up but if you say they're still easy to source then I guess I can put them back on the list of things to look out for. I'd love one of those old chevy beauvilles.  I can see your point about the astro. To do any kind of work to it you ALWAYS have to remove some other parts to gain access. Its a bit of a pain but not enough for me to want to sell mine just yet.

That is really freaking cheap.  here is a read about why you can find some cheap panels Basically the panels are not UL rated (no insurance will cover them for use in electrical systems. i.e. if it burns your place down its on you if they learn of it. Likewise the panels are damaged or improperly manufactured.  If you can find legit panels for 150 (I can find 50watt for around 100$ at the cheapest) then you have an awesome deal.

I have the 400 Yeti with a Boulder 30 panel. Yes, it was overpriced for the wattage (especially the panel). But the thing is, I had a few extra bucks when I bought it, I wanted my entire system to be portable (as opposed to permanently mounted in my van), i know absolutely nothing about hooking up a solar system and I was looking for something I could buy and use immediately without having to figure out wiring or asking/hiring someone for help. So the goal zero stuff I bought fit all those needs. While I wouldn't try using my yeti to power a fridge, i do use it for everything else: lighting, cell phone, ipod, usb speakers, laptop, hair clippers. I often watch movies on my laptop for 4hrs and the battery has never run down below 60%. Overall I'm pretty happy with it."
vandwellers,31sat6,crockett5,2,Tue Apr 7 21:24:40 2015 UTC,I completely understand wiring of a solar system can being intimidating. I didn't know anything about it when I decided to build my first system and I'm still not much of an expert but really it's not that complicated.   It's really just Solar Panel > Charge Controller > Battery > Inverter &/or direct DC power.  Now you will likely want a fuse or breaker between the solar panel & the battery and then another between the inverter as well as the DC out.  This is actually a decent looking cheap set up some guy on youtube made for $150 bucks. It only uses a 10w panel but that could be upgraded but the rest of it is about the same as the Yeti in fact he has an 18ah battery so a bit more.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucQEw8xeNA&list=PLzDqzoFXpmIna4UVhH-gxzIIOIfnLNywC

I'd appreciate any thoughts/research you've got on solar in the UK"
vandwellers,31sat6,64mb,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"I think you've done your calculation wrong for your setup. Based on those hours of use, you'd draw 56.6w which at 12v is 4.71amps. Deep cycle batteries can be discharged down to 25% of their capacity. But to prolong life let's go with 40%  (85 x 0.60) / 4.7 = 10.8 days  40w panel at 100% would produce 2.28amps (pulled this number from a random ebay listing for a 40w panel), obviously that won't be there all the time. At 25% we're looking at 0.57amps over let's say 8 hours (assuming it averages out at 25% over the day). 2.28 x 0.25 x 8 = 4.56amps.  These are really rough calculations, but even with loss of efficiency from many things I think it will be plenty to keep you going.  I kinda settled on 100w panel as that's what everyone else with the T5's are using, despite the fact they also run fridges. And 110 amp battery was the biggest I could fit under my seat."
vandwellers,31sat6,kenbw2,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:21:24 2015 UTC,"Maths is my least favourite thing, so I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if I was wrong on my calculations. But I can't see how it can be anything else. Here's my thinking, tell me if any of it is flawed  I know for a fact that my monitor pulls 40W at 240V. Wattage isn't affected by voltage, so that's still 40W at 12V. 40W at 12V is 3.333 Amps. Over 1 hour that's 3.333Ah. Multiply that by 4 (hours) that's 13.333Ah just to run the monitor.  I think your figure of 4.7Amps is per hour. So 4.7Ah, over 5 hours is 23Ah.  I too was thinking 100W because obviously over here we'll never see anything close to optimum, but if my calculations are right it's still more of a subsidy than a full solution"
vandwellers,31sat6,64mb,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"Oh right yeah, thought you meant the monitor uses 40w for the whole 4 hours. All makes sense now, apologies. I think to run all of this stuff you may need to look at using these things less, more efficient alternatives or more/bigger batteries and a bigger panel. 2x 100Ah batteries + 2x 100w panels.  I've got a pretty small setup which consists of: laptop (charge this at work as to not rely on the inverter), diesel heater ~1A only on for an hour or 2, lights ~0.5A, phone charging ~1A."

I responded to his post with some reasons those shown on google shopping might be listed as that cheap. But if he can find you a legit panel for that price pick one up.  Here's how I'd shop.  50 Watt rigid solar panel. China to front door $100  MPPT charge controller. China to door $8  Battery, no way around spending money here. You get what you pay for. I'd go with this 35 amp-hour deep cycle battery. $110 Remember to use smile.amazon.com instead of just amazon as smile cost you nothing but donates to charity.   That's a total of $218 vsthe 430 you were going to spend.   Here are some other Items I would buy. I didn't look around at prices but you may be able to find for cheaper.  Not going to go full nerd on you (unless you ask for more details or you can goto /r/solar and read up) but for an inverter I'd go full sine wave instead of the cheaper clipped or pwm generated. I'd also recommend more than 400 watts so that you can plug anything into it short of a microwave. So I'd recommend this 500 watt full sine inverter. Chine to door $132  The better bet for you is probably this choice at 200 watt, clipped pwm 120 volt inverter. China to door $25  I'd also set up a USB strip just for things that need to charge off the 5 volt or 12 volt USB power. I'd go with this option for $12 china to door. Clip the wires on the source side and wire the wires directly to to your 12 volt load bus.  If you have questions feel free to ask.  Best choice is using a battery isolator to charge your deep cycle battery while the engine is in use (but isolating the high starting amp low use engine battery from the long term storage deep cycle battery.)

vandwellers,31np3e,steezefries,8,Mon Apr 6 18:55:06 2015 UTC,I really like this. That external lock though is a little terrifying. It would be so easy for some jerk to slap a lock on that or even just put a piece of wire through it and lock people in. I would find a new locking system that can be unlocked from inside...
vandwellers,31np3e,Strategian,2,Mon Apr 6 22:02:29 2015 UTC,"Looks like they thought of that, too:   I hung the door. It has bolts on the inside and outside (the outside can be locked open or closed to help prevent 'accidentally' getting locked inside)."
vandwellers,31np3e,darkcode,3,Tue Apr 7 08:39:55 2015 UTC,"A bit of pitch on the roof will make this shed rain and last a lot longer.  I'd make it 2"" higher in the front than in the back.  If you pitch the other 'intuitive' way, the wind will drive rain into any gaps while you're driving.    I'd also put a layer of epoxy fiberglass on the roof and wrapped around the top corners. Paint on top to protect the epoxy from UV degradation.    I'd also pay attention to water getting in from the bottom."
vandwellers,31np3e,vtjohnhurt,4,Tue Apr 7 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"Looks cool. A couple of things though, with all of those 2x4s how much does it weigh? Why not put a deadbolt on it so you can't accidently get locked in?"

vandwellers,31np3e,darkcode,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:39:21 2015 UTC,But you would have to lock the outside open to prevent getting locked in. Maybe I just don't trust people I'd be terrified that if I forgot to lock it some jerk would close the bolt on me.

vandwellers,31np3e,ocelotpotpie,0,Mon Apr 6 19:33:32 2015 UTC,This trailer is built on a 4 foot by 8 foot Harbor Freight trailer frame.   Expect it to last about 8 weeks.
vandwellers,31np3e,_zarathustra,7,Mon Apr 6 20:56:51 2015 UTC,Lol? I'm not that big of a Harbor freight fan.. But there's a huge following for people building campers using their trailers because of the bang for the buck. Their trailers and actual really nice.
vandwellers,31np3e,viamana,4,Mon Apr 6 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"They're cheap, and a decent bang for the buck, but they definitely don't qualify as ""really nice"". A lot of folks weld them together, which makes them more stable. It's not made out of balsa wood, so if you care for it then it should last a reasonably long time. But if you have one side by side with a quality trailer then the build quality and fit and finish is obvious."
vandwellers,31np3e,SpartanMonkey,3,Mon Apr 6 23:23:01 2015 UTC,Why's that? Are Harbor Freight products bad quality or something? The author said the whole thing has lasted a while.
vandwellers,31np3e,VF5,6,Mon Apr 6 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"They tend to sell some cheap stuff, but I haven't had any real issues with anything I've bought there. I have a rotary hammer I bought from there that has lasted 8 years through a decent amount of use. Either way, you can buy a different trailer if you'd like. The idea is what's important here! Not the author by the way."
vandwellers,31np3e,HoldenMyD,3,Mon Apr 6 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"Harbor Freight items are super cheap and mostly made in China, which is why they are hugely discounted. This is common knowledge in the construction/carpentry trades. Most Harbor Freight tools are considered ""disposable"" because of their propensity to fail. Harbor Freight is the hardware dollar store.  However, if you are a DIY'r or have a one-time project that requires a specialized tool, HF is the best place to go. I have bought stuff there myself lots of times, but would never trust them if I were in the biz. I bought a puller from them when I was restoring an old Triumph motorbike, and it stripped the part. It was an expensive mistake on my part that could have been solved by ordering the proper tool."
vandwellers,31np3e,pickymeek,2,Mon Apr 6 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"That's how I treat harbor freight. If I am going to use a power tool a lot, I go high quality. If I just need it for a project or two, like an electric cut off tool, I'll get it from HF. If I need it again and it still works? Bonus."
vandwellers,31np3e,mandiblebutt,-3,Tue Apr 7 09:39:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. Am I the only one finding that this is ridiculous? That ""camper"" is so small that you're better off buying a van. I've seen a bedford rascal with more space that that camper."
vandwellers,31osqw,Minivan2016,3,Mon Apr 6 23:49:03 2015 UTC,"Well - Just one thing is that as cars get older, engine becomes less efficient.   Another one is that you are living in this / possibly lots of weight added. Those numbers are for a stock vehicle not loaded up. Extra weight can really drop your mileage as well.   Just some ideas."
vandwellers,31osqw,Bernieslo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:21:17 2015 UTC,Ah I see so the numbers are for stock with out anything inside? never thought about that... Just the weight of the driver I guess. Maybe a skinny driver too! It does feel a bit low... but combined says 12 mpg so I am so close to that loaded. I would guess that the FWY value is running in the FWY till the tank runs out? That would be hitting that sweet FWY right? I still need to get off the FWY and go through the city on a daily basis but I always take the freeway when possible.
vandwellers,31osqw,907KHAM687,2,Wed Apr 8 17:42:08 2015 UTC,I am not sure I am reading this correctly.    93.8 miles & 11.9 Gals = 372.3/39.3 = 9.4 mpg Does this mean you drove 93 miles and then topped off the tank with 11.9 gallons of gas?  189.6 miles & 11.9 Gals = 561.9/51.2 = 10.9 mpg Does this mean you drove 190 miles and and then topped off the tank with 11.9 gallons of gas?
vandwellers,31osqw,ocelotpotpie,1 point,Tue Apr 7 09:01:36 2015 UTC,The miles entry is the amount of miles I got from the amount of gasoline I put in the tank previously. The Gals next to that is the New amount of gasoline I put in the tank when I stopped at the gasoline station. The number/number is the total amount of miles and gallons I have ran/used since I've had the Van. I hope that helps? I don't top off the tank though I have been told that I should....
vandwellers,31osqw,crockett5,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:28:06 2015 UTC,The fuel economy numbers are likely listed for an empty vehicle. Is yours full of gear and retrofitted for living? That'd explain the drop in mileage.
vandwellers,31osqw,907KHAM687,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it has some stuff in it, but really not a whole lot. Not sure on how many pounds but maybe... I don't know... 300 pounds? I can't be certain unless I'd weight the van prior then re weight after putting my stuff, but its not a lot so there really wouldn't be much of a point :(."

My first time sleeping in my truck, I felt like puking and was convinced that every leaf was an axe murderer. Now, I recently got a solid, 9 straight hours of sleep at a Nebraska rest stop and was a little bummed to have to keep driving in the morning. You'll stop caring what people think about you. I've been the weirdo chick shaving her armpits in a coffee shop parking lot, or cooking bacon on my tailgate at a popular cycling trailhead. Nobody gives a shit what you're doing. At the worst, they assume you're crazy and leave you alone. See #2.  Just assess your hobbies before you decide to live in a van. If you like gourmet cooking, you'll be less happy living in a van than someone who likes to hike or rock climb."

I still like long hot showers but they are just fewer and further between. I don't need them to be happy.  Video games were a major time waster, so I haven't really missed them a hell of a lot.  People that have problems sleeping, should just go to a place like Walmart till you get used to it. You won't ever be bugged there so you don't have to worry about axe murderers or cops harassing you."
vandwellers,31mem2,crockett5,2,Mon Apr 6 17:54:23 2015 UTC,I second this. I was the same. I think now I am healthier thanks to the change. Though I still have a lot to learn about this life style. I feel like I can thrive if I just keep working hard at it and learning!
vandwellers,31mem2,Minivan2016,2,Mon Apr 6 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"Radio Shack used to sell a nice outdoor USB wifi antenna, it claims on the box to do up to a mile, but on a good day, we for sure have had a mile and a half out of it, good enough ping to play online games. Weatherproof too, so you can mount em outside if you are somewhere where buggers wont nick em."
vandwellers,31mem2,wankshaft,8,Tue Apr 7 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"It's living in a van, my expectations were pretty low. So far it has exceeded them. I went into it just saying well if it's completely unbearable, I'll put the van back on craigslist and go be slightly more normal.  This guy just isn't cut out for the life. If you can't handle gym lockerrooms don't do this. I think about cops roughly 0% of the time, and theft -0%. What kept me up until I got my sleeping bag was I'm really cold. That became I don't want to leave the sleeping bag because it's cold outside it. So I got my Mr. Heater. Then it was pretty decent. Now it's becoming Spring and pretty nice.   For ventilation you can crack a window. I don't really understand opening it up to clean. The small area of the van makes cleaning really quick and easy. You don't have that much stuff to pick up either because where do you put it you live in a van.  Not sure what kind of hobbies this guy has but I think it's great for hobbies, especially if you don't like being couped up in the van. It forces you to get out and go do it."
vandwellers,31mem2,bestthrowawayeverrr,7,Mon Apr 6 16:21:47 2015 UTC,1.- Sleep inside the van. Then 2.- Live life outside. ;)

vandwellers,31mem2,TheOriginalGoron,5,Mon Apr 6 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. ""Unwilling"" or maybe just ""unprepared."" He did say that he jumped in ""with both feet"" ... Maybe he didn't have any experience with camping, road tripping or traveling at all."
vandwellers,31mem2,Arianafer,5,Mon Apr 6 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I think anyone who gets into the vanlife by choice should think it over thoroughly. If this person thought it through more, he likely wouldnt have done it in the first place. I think some of us are attracted to the adventure and dare I say glamour of it, but the reality of everyday life in a van is something you have to be somewhat mentally prepared for."
vandwellers,31mem2,One_Awesome_Inch,3,Mon Apr 6 15:42:23 2015 UTC,An important read. It's easy to forget just how dramatic a lifestyle change vandwelling can be and not to hand-wave away the thoughts of it being a hard transition.
vandwellers,31mem2,John-Garrison,6,Mon Apr 6 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"High on the list is lack of solid sleep. I just don't understand how a person can be relaxed and get solid sleep knowing that at any moment a cop may knock on ones door or window.     If this happens, so what? They aren't going to arrest you.. just have you move along. At worse, you might get a fine or something.   In addition in the back of my mind ( in some areas) is slight concern about thieves, vandals etc. I do have bear spray and plenty of surprises for anyone trying to break in, so am not very concerned but if someone were to try and break in and I had to do serious damage to stop them whose fault would it be? Not mine of course but then again who knows how the authorities and a possible a jury would view it?    I've thought about this, and I do have a gun for protection. However, I don't think it is likely. At least on par with have your apartment or house broken into. Plus who is gonna rob a van?    Another thing is the lack of privacy at fitness centers. I find it very uncomfortable spending time grooming my goatee, stash, and so forth after having walked through a minefield of germs.     This sounds like a personal issue. You do need to give less fucks and not be worried about public restrooms.    Then there is the problem of hanging out and cleaning my van in a relaxed manner. Where, in the city, does one open up the doors and windows to air out the rig while organizing things etc?     Go to a park and clean it out. People will either come up to you and start chatting or give you weird looks and walk away.    I have many hobbies. For some reason I thought I could continue them. I can to some extent but am seriously limited in some respects.     I've continued to do all my hobbies. I dunno what hobbies he is talking that he stopped but if it something that requires space there are libraries/parks/ect for that kind of stuff."
vandwellers,31mem2,hightiedye,3,Mon Apr 6 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"What hobbies do you do?  I have never lived in a van (yet) but I'm thinking about it and I am particularly wary of giving up hobbies like homebrewing, gardening, cooking (a portable stove can do a lot but nothing close to a full kitchen), playing large musical instruments, and tinkering with technology (too many parts, not enough organization/space to warrant it). It's not just that these things require space to do, but they require a lot of storage while you're not actively doing it."
vandwellers,31mem2,spacebicycle,3,Mon Apr 6 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, I'm not the guy you responded to but I wrote something similar to him. I play on sports teams, work out, ride bike, internet, photography, and read, so it didn't particularly impact me much. There might be organized groups for some of your hobbies that you can find on meetup.com I know a makerspace I was involved in was doing a brewing project, some sorta hydropnics thing, and all the technology stuff you could ask for."
vandwellers,31mem2,bestthrowawayeverrr,3,Mon Apr 6 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yea I can see how homebrewing might be an issue. I don't know about homebrewing but you can always rent out a storage locker or maybe find something within the community. For gardening you can always take part in your community garden if your local area has one. I am in the process of buying a plot of land to set up my own permacultured farm to grow my own food. I play guitar, cook (4 by 3 kitchen with one stove which I admit is more difficult than the 4 stove I was used to), tinker with technology in the van. I also work out, bike ride, play video games requiring high speed connection among other things."
vandwellers,31mem2,hightiedye,3,Mon Apr 6 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"I home brewed in my RV for a while, it was a bit of a pain when it came to bottle, other than that, it lived in the toilet room. Is a 20 foot Winnebago, not a stealth van, I'm pretty sure you could make a MR. Beer style arrangement, or a small demijohn or two in a stealth van though, with some difficulty.  If you were stashed in the country and the weather was permitting, a sly outside brew set up, some netting and that? Mind you, a storage unit like /u/hightiedye says would be ideal.   We have crammed in 4 computers, 2 desks, 3 monitors, a record deck a guitar or two and all sorts of boardgame / card crap in the cupboards :D   I know this is not an ideal stealth solution, but if you are seriously into your hobbies /u/spacebicycle a smaller RV may be the way to go. We also grow some indoor plants using LED grow lamps, both decorative and useful :D As for other gardening we have buckets in which we grow taters and carrots, and decorative flowers and whatnot, that when we move we just haul up with us.   Mind you folks staying in Walmarts and on the stealth would not be able to do this, as we stay in national parks, and shell out for RV parks and occasionally hide in the country."
vandwellers,31mem2,wankshaft,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds great. Internet is a big question for me; what do you do for a high-speed connection? Since you're talkin' about buying land it sounds like you stay in one area, which probably makes high-speed Internet easier?"

For high speed (read low ping not necessarily high bandwidth but thats nice too since I download large files a lot) I used libraries (I am at one right now), universities, or other hotspots. Comcast, TWC, ATT have them all over the place.  Here is a blogpost I did on the subject: http://davidlane.info/internet/  The relevant part would be the yagi attenta which allows me to get high speed internet in the van in some situations."

I'm pretty high bandwidth myself (steam, streaming, video piracy, and Crashplan) and consider a strong gaming PC a necessity, so this has been something of a question as I consider vandwelling.  I bet you see a lot of those ""Xfinity"" hotspots that Comcast creates from unwitting customers' modems. I've been loving those since my $10/month Republic Wireless phone doesn't have 3G."
vandwellers,31mem2,Seascan,2,Tue Apr 7 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"In the words of Anderson 'The Spider' Silva: ""Is Normal"". Sounds about right. I mean, what did you expect? You are living out in the streets and not inside a nice cozy home. Less individualism. I think it is more about living in the states than anything else. In other much poorer countries people tend to spend more time together as opposed to being more isolated and, sorry to say, pampered. With the exception of Japan, I guess?! You know with all of those public bath houses and what not. Now that is some other level of community. Yep, just keep on going and you will hopefully get used to it. Hopefully!

I was sitting in bed last night just looking at it and feeling weird about it. I think one of the reasons I feel weird about it is that I like to decorate and make my space look good to me, but with such a huge space it's hard to have it decorated without having a lot of stuff. And the last thing I want is a lost of stuff. Van life is tied into the minimalistic, anti-consumeristic ideologies for me."

vandwellers,31kx1q,GuitarGod1333,11,Mon Apr 6 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"You should live in the dorms for your first semester (at least.)  Here is why:  1) Freshman dorms are a lot of fun!   You will be meeting a lot of people your age who are on their own for the first time and looking to make new friends.  You will likely party in each other's rooms, take the same classes together, and study together.  These memories and friendships could last a life time, but you wont have as much opportunity to do these things if you are living in your van.   2) You probably don't have the necessary resources to van dwell at the moment.    If you are going to be a full time college student, your likely won't have time to work a job or have the starting resources required to comfortably dwell in a van.  Since your parents are against your plan, you wont be able to count on their support, and unless you are independently wealthy, they are likely going to be your main financial life-line during college.  3) You should focus solely on your studies, and van problems can distract you from school.    Do you really want to decide between partying on a friday with your friends, studying for an important final, writing a paper, or fixing up some urgent problem with your van in a parking lot? Do you want to be hassled by the campus police for living in your van? Do you want to be dealing with laptop battery problems at 4 AM when you are trying to finish a paper? You will have these problems if you live in a van. Not so if you are in a dorm.  4) Your new peers are going to judge you for living in a van, and that's a bad first impression to start out with.    Its going to be awkward to explain to people you are meeting for the first time about your van life.  You are going to be known as the Van guy, probably as the ""creepy van guy."" For example, let's say you and a sexy lady/man are talking, things are going well, and you decide to make a move. Compare these two sentences:  ""Hey sexy, want to go back to my dorm room to watch a movie?"" and ""Hey sexy, want to go back to my van to watch a movie?""  5) Van dwelling is a highly mobile life-style, while being a college student is a relatively sedentary lifestyle.   6) Your going to piss off and stress out your parents."

That's part of why I'm in a van now. Room and board at any college will be a good $5k per semester. Currently vandwelling expenses are a grand total of a couple dollars a day food + price of gym membership + gas for driving + propane for heat. Most people pay for food, gas, gym, heat in addition to rent anyways.  A school will have a nice library and gym for you to use. You could also usually get into dorms and use their bathrooms by waiting at the door of any dorm looking like a student who forgot their i.d. or is waiting for someone to come downstairs. It will take a couple minutes before another student comes through and let's you in. Most schools also give students a number of guest passes for meals. My school gave tons of them that I never used. You could make friends and have them swipe meals for you.  Your expenses are minimal. The cost of the van pays for itself in a semester in savings alone and you can sell it after you're done with it. Rather than using your student loan on renting an apartment I would get the van."

To prepare yourself for knowing if the van life is for you, try living day to day out of your your room in your house. don't use any the other rooms or if you do keep it to a minimum. You will learn quickly whether it bothers you or not to live like that."

vandwellers,31kx1q,ambulancechaser1,2,Mon Apr 6 23:53:06 2015 UTC,A school is honestly an excellent place for living out of a van. Depending on how big the school is there's always parking near the dorms that has a heavy flow of different cars. You can find laundry services in said dorms and you can shower at the school provided gym. Also you have to worry less about food if you have a meal plan but that's also expensive. Just some things to think about the practical aspect of doing this.
vandwellers,31kx1q,Brian62793,4,Mon Apr 6 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"Warning: I'm not a vandweller yet...  However, I'd love to shed some light on vandwelling and your situation.  First and foremost, my best advice is to just go and do it! Like with any other alternative lifestyle choice, you'll face criticism from people, even your parents. This is normal. Just calmly explain to them why exactly you're doing it (keep college expenses down, live a more free and adventure-filled life, etc), and be prepared to answer the standard questions (Where will you poop? Where will you park? Where will you shower?). Every time I bring vandwelling up, I get those questions. Better to have solid answers than look like a fool. Honestly, I wish I would've known about the lifestyle when I was your age. I had a decent amount of money saved up, and could've easily purchased a campervan instead of blowing it on rent and other BS.   What are expenses like in the van? Truthfully, I have yet to attempt to live in my van. But I have a pretty good idea of what my expenses will look like. Initial setup costs are super variable, depending on what you're looking for. For example, I bought my GMC Jimmy for $400, and eventually traded it for my Astro van. The Astro needs some work, which I'm currently dealing with. From there, it's all about relative comfort. I can hang my hammock in my van, and sleep there at night. Do you want a bed? Solar power? Running water? A bathroom? Or, do you just wanna splurge on a used class B with most of the amenities of a larger RV? For me, I'm treating the Astro as sort of a stepping-stone to something bigger and better. Therefore, I'm going about it the cheap way: my hammock for my bed, solar USB charger ($20, Amazon), Eton solar-powered Bluetooth speaker system with USB charger for phone ($56, Amazon). My phone is basically the only thing I use power for on a daily basis, so this cheap route makes sense to me. I'll splurge on a whole solar setup when I get something better. For cooking, you can get a single burner propane stove for $20, cheap cooler, and some cheap cookware at thrift stores. For bathroom and shower usage, I suggest a gym membership. For $20/month, you can get the Planet Fitness black card, which allows you to use any Planet Fitness location in the US, and bring a friend! Since you're going off to college, you can probably make use of the facilities on campus. I suggest a backup potty, just in case of emergency.  As far as monthly van expenses go, it all depends on how much you drive. Currently, I spend around $30 in gas every 2 weeks. I suspect it would stay about the same living in the van without any out-of-town traveling. Oil change every 3000 miles is usually about $30. So, we'll call vehicle related expenses about $75/month. Save up more, though, and expect the unexpected. Food definitely varies from person to person. I could get by on about $15/week, but I wouldn't want to. I'd budget $50/week on food. Then, budget in any bills. For example, insurance on my van is $105/month, and my phone is $50/month. So, I could get by on about $430/month, easily. Like I said, it all varies from person to person.  What do I do to sustain living in a van? I work full-time at a call center. I average about $280-$300/week doing this. It's easy work, but people tend to hate it. My goal is to save up a bit of money while living in a van, and become a photographer. I'd sell my photography at flea markets and stuff. Plus, storm chasing is a hobby of mine. If you get good footage from that, you can sell it to news companies for a decent amount. I wouldn't mind doing freelance writing and editing, though. And busking can turn a profit, too, especially in artsy cities.  Transitioning to a road warrior is something I have little experience with. I've wanted to do it for 2 years now, and getting rid of your crap is kinda difficult. Do what I did, and just start chipping away at your stuff. Ask yourself ""Do I really need this? Do I use it often enough to consider keeping it?"" Chances are, if you're having to ask yourself, you probably don't need it. Speaking of which, I'm currently preparing to dive into the van life, and I have a lot of crap to get rid of now!   Good luck! Keep us posted on your progress!"

vandwellers,31hu9a,40oztofreedomtoday,10,Mon Apr 6 21:09:17 2015 UTC,What kind of van? What is the worst thing that has happened to you? What is the best thing that has happened to you? Where do you see yourself in another 3 years? Worst place you have been? Best place you have been?
vandwellers,31hu9a,Arrivaderchie,23,Sun Apr 5 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"We drive a 1994 Ford Econoline conversion van. Probably the worst thing that's happened would have to be when we got a flat tire at about 7,000ft elevation in western Colorado in the middle of NOWHERE. We normally carry a spare tire under the bed incase of emergencies but we had just used it on a different tire before we headed up the mountains. We waited about an hour or so for a tow, which wasn't that bad considering the mountain view was incredible. But we ended up getting ripped off by the driver and spent our last $200 that was supposed to get us to our camping destination which was at about 9'000ft. Due to it being a Saturday night on a holiday weekend we ended up sleeping in the van in front of a mechanics for two days before we got any assistance. Looking back on the experience though I'd have to say it was pretty enlightening. Waking up in a strange mountain town with no money, a flat tire, and an pitbull circling your van will teach you a few things about yourself.  The best thing would have to be when we took the van to a mechanic way up in northern Wisconsin only to have over $1,500 worth of parts/labor put into the van and (by a miracle of God) we weren't charged a dime, due to the mechanics respect for our lifestyle. To top that off, about a month later (right around christmas time) I found a sealed envelope the mechanic had hidden in between some books with $500 in it.  Living in a van with your spouse can have an overwhelming effect on some individuals :) In another 3 years if we're not still traveling then we've found some land with good trees, close to a body of water good for fishing, with lots of sunshine, good soil, and good hunting. I'd like to be as self-sufficient as possible. It's important to be in nature, primarily for your physical and mental health.  The worst place we've been would have to be the desert. Too hot and too dry. A crucial part of van living is being able to go outside. The desert is the worst. Its too hot to be in the van and too hot to be out of the van. We've been in a lot of beautiful and amazing places (especially in Colorado) but probably the most relaxing place we've been would have to be Padre Island, Tx. $12 bought us a years worth of camping right on the beach about three feet from the ocean. We didn't stay for a full year but nothing beats sleeping in the van right there on the sand next to the waves while a full moon beams down from across the shore. Absolutely beautiful."
vandwellers,31hu9a,papske,4,Sun Apr 5 07:15:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, a YEAR's worth of camping for $12? Can you elaborate a little bit, because that sure caught my eye!  Edit: I just read a later post of yours on ""work camping"", I'm assuming that's how you did it?"
vandwellers,31hu9a,karmaisdharma,6,Sun Apr 5 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"You can camp out on the beach out there in your rv, van, or in a tent for just $12. There are bathrooms and outdoor showers along the beach that are free to use and you can set up a bonfire right in the sand. You can even fish in the ocean out there. Many people just drive  all the way up to the shore with their trucks, spend an hour or so digging up ghost shrimp and spend the rest of the day with their fishing poles out in the sea while they just sit in a chair reading. You wouldn't have electricity or anything like that.. it's just basic camping. There's a ton of vandwellers out there, but everyone tends to find a place to camp out on their own... we never ran into any creepy or sketchy people, most nights we were the only ones out where we were parked.  Further up the coast the beach turns into more of a college scene on the weekends, with a bunch of kids partying in their vehicles but they stay up with the crowd. We were always parked in a quieter spot. If we needed electricity for something, we would just drive to the nearest library and spend a few hours catching up online  and charging our phones. We weren't work camping when we were out there.. we were just relaxing :)"
vandwellers,31hu9a,karmaisdharma,4,Mon Apr 6 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Obviously I'm not OP, but I'm from Central Texas so maybe I can explain. Texas beaches honestly aren't ""good"" compared to other big beach states like Cali. However, that doesn't mean they're bad by any means! But $12 will buy you a ""beach pass"" that's valid for a calendar year allowing you to drive on the beach, etc. Many parts of the beach are open for vehicle traffic (to an extent) as long as it's not on front of a hotel. While overnight camping isn't always allowed, respectful vehicles are often overlooked, and a lot of places will have a ""3 day limit"" so as long as you move down a bit, and don't cause problems, you're fine.  Hopefully that answered your question, and this is only how I assume they did it!  A word to those interested: don't be fooled by Texas beaches. I've seen many cars end up in the water since people forget that shitty beaches still have tides!"
vandwellers,31hu9a,karmaisdharma,3,Mon Apr 6 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Holy moly you're gonna have to elaborate more on the story about the mechanic, he (she) sounds absolutely Christ-like."
vandwellers,31hu9a,budgardner,6,Sun Apr 5 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Mechanic is a Christian. While we were waiting for the van to be worked on my husband and I were sitting in the office portion of the garage reading free bible tracks that the Mechanic had set out for customers. He saw us reading them and later that evening sat and talked about God with my husband for a few hours. He told us it would take about a week to finish working on the van and allowed us to stay in an apartment that he rents out for free. During that week, my husband and I would have dinner with him each night and visit with him while we worked in the garage. At the end of the week, we had attended church with him, had dinner at his mother house, and met his grandparents. That being said, by the time the van was finished, we had become friends and he did not want to charge us for the services, even after we offered to pay. Over the years my husband and I have gone back to visit him. My husband even helped him put a new roof on his shop. Vandwelling can lead to some extraordinary friendships and experiences if you're open to it."

I've heard a lot of beaches are sticklers for overnight parking, do you guys just find a neighborhood to post up in to sleep or do you know any sweet spots along the beach that you park at? Colorado is a PERFECT state to spend the summer van dwelling in! I'm a hot spring/backpacking fanatic and Colorado is all about that lifestyle. Great people too.   What's your hubbies set up like?

vandwellers,31hu9a,betterworldbiker,3,Mon Apr 6 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's easier and safer to find quiet neighborhoods to just park in.. just make sure to look for the parking regulation signs.. there's a lot of streets where you can't park on certain days. Just have to make sure you park when your ready to sleep so home owners don't notice too much movement in a strange parked van on their street :) Also, Walmart Supercenters allow rv'ers and vandwellers to park in their parking lots over night so thats always an option.

vandwellers,31hu9a,Cairnnage,13,Sun Apr 5 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"We work at campgrounds. It's called work camping. Campgrounds are always looking to hire travelers to work for a season. We each make an hourly wage and typically get to stay in a full hook-up campsite for free, plus free laundry, free wifi, free showers, plus whatever else the campground offers. Usually they only hire for about 20-30 hours a week which leaves a lot of time for writing/hiking/ or exploring whatever part of the country you happen to be in for that season. We've always lucked out and have managed to travel across the country several times a year work camping. The sleeping situation is pretty comfortable actually. My husband converted a Ford Econoline and built a bed in the back after removing the seats. Fits a full size futon mattress and there's still walkable room in between the bed and the front seats big enough to fit a standard 6 drawer dresser.  He built the bed up about 3 feet from the floor so we have a bunch of storage underneath :)"

Lots of times these jobs are taken by retired couples who have sold their house and live in RV's. Basically you work 20 - 30 hours between the two of you. Or 10-20 hours by yourself (depending on the campground) Some of the things you might have to do is clean bathrooms, clean out fire pits, mow lawns, and just do general upkeep of the grounds. Lots of times, if the campground hires a couple, the wife would work a few hours in the office helping with reservations and check-ins and the husband would help out with building or grounds keeping. Its really simple stuff."

vandwellers,31hu9a,ratcandies,11,Sun Apr 5 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"In my experience, its always best to have a spare tire. You do NOT want to be stuck in the middle of a national forest with no cell service and a flat tire. The way my husband built the bed allows for us to carry a spare underneath. Also, it tends to get extra warm inside the van depending on where your camping/driving. I would recommend packing multiple fans. Seriously. Also, if you plan on doing any mountain driving, plan on using the D1 and D2 gears so your brakes don't start on fire! If you just google work camping you'll find a ton of different websites.

vandwellers,31hu9a,lotsoluck,3,Sun Apr 5 08:10:12 2015 UTC,I've found that campgrounds normally pay around $8-10 an hour. Some campgrounds offer a little more like free laundry or free propane and others offer discounts in the store or on-site restaurants. All work camping jobs offer free camping with full hook-ups. The work is pretty basic. They account for the fact that the workers are seasonal and change from year to year. All you would be doing is grounds keeping or helping out with check-ins or reservations anywhere from 10-20 hours a week. Sometimes we've negotiated more work hours if we needed to make more $$$. Plus a lot of campgrounds have campers that pay to camp for the full length of the season. Sometimes you can work out a deal to help out some of these campers with site maintenance (like raking leaves or mowing lawns) over the course of the season for a few extra $$ a month.

vandwellers,31hu9a,bbuk11,11,Sun Apr 5 07:46:15 2015 UTC,"We drove to Zion National Park this past October and had some trouble finding a campsite. We hadn't booked a site in advance because we weren't sure when we would arrive.. we like to take our time driving when we can. We didn't get there till around dinner time one night and most of the surrounding campgrounds were full. We decided to drive a few miles away from the park and pulled into this gorgeous rv resort. But once we started the check-in process,which we were willing to pay extra money for, the hosts ever so nicely stated that ""The owners don't allow people to sleep in vans like that at this resort. You'll have to find somewhere else."" and then proceeded to hand us a small piece of paper with directions to free camping locations further out in the desert. We ended up driving a few more miles away and just asked a clerk at a brand new gas station located in the middle of town if we could sleep in their parking lot for the night. Saved us about $50 bucks. Arguments and vandwelling are the worst. Finding the space to let off steam after an argument in the middle of the night is probably the hardest part. As mad as we can be at each other, we still have to coincide in our tiny living space. I tend to go for a power walk directly afterwards and basically speed walk the anger off. My husband and I don't argue that often (Thank God), but when we do we certainly make it count! :) This one particular time, we had been camping up in the mountains in Lake City, Colorado for about two months. The campground we were staying at happened to be in a secluded valley, about 3 and 1/2  miles off of a dirt road at about 9'000 ft elevation. I can't remember what the argument was about but I remember my anger. I stormed off in a huff, power walking down the dirt road and veered off on a hiking trail that led to this gorgeous view of the valley. I hiked up as high as my anger could take me and just stood there overlooking the mountains and proceeded to yell at my husband (who obviously in no way could hear me). After yelling for what felt like a good 15 minutes, I started to notice a quick change in the weather. Then, as payback for my wrath I presume, it started hailing. I literally had to hike a little over a mile up a mountain side back to our campsite in a white tank top and shorts during a hailstorm. I was PISSED."

vandwellers,31hu9a,fivefootfour,5,Wed Apr 8 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"I am a Christian but I am not religious. Religion focuses more on law and the true teachings of Jesus were to understand that no one can be perfect and basically to love one another, regardless of the mistakes we make. We usually don't attend church unless someone we meet asks us to attend with them. When we're traveling we tend to listen to podcasts or sermons online and we read the bible together. Sometimes we'll just go to random church services in random towns, with no concern for the denomination. After the service my husband and I would usually go for a walk and just discuss the sermon and what we agree with or don't agree with. It's actually been a very interesting way to learn more about God and the people who love him.   I explained in a few other replies how we got into vandwelling, but basically my husband and I were ready for a change in our lives. We wanted to experience the world in the truest way that we could. While at times it can be a challenge, ultimately I've learned more about myself and what I believe to be the meaning of life in these past few years in the van than I've learned in my entire life."

It looks like your work camping setup saves you a bit on campsite costs, but I'd love to know how much food/maintenance/insurance etc is .   Also, do you feel limited in any way by the cost of fuel? I'd imagine that would be one of the larger annual expenses, and with my dream of travelling the continent in a converted van, the only thing that gives me pause is the cost of filling up a heavy vehicle that gets maybe 11mpg."
vandwellers,31hu9a,fivefootfour,3,Sun Apr 5 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"Our biggest expenses are definitely insurance and gas. They way we combat these issues is just with a little financial planning. With insurance, we typically save up to be able to pay off about 6 months in advance. That way we can travel and camp out for a decent amount of time without worrying what the date is to make sure our bills are paid.   When it comes to gas, if we know we're going to be traveling a great distance, we try to calculate how much gas money we're going to need to get to our destination. We normally drive to locations where we know we'll be able to work camp, so our main focus is having enough gas money to get to where we're going. Once we're their and working, we're able to save money. Work camping is rent free living. That means no rent check, no electric bill, no water bill, etc. So we're able to keep almost all of our earnings.   Food is actually very inexpensive if you eat healthy. My husband and I keep a storage bin in the van that we continually stock with canned vegetables that we find but at dollar stores. Just look for the  the un-dented cans that only contain the ""good"" stuff like for example a can of corn containing only corn, water, and sugar. Thats $1 a can. $20 worth is enough vegetables for almost a month. Also, fresh fruits and vegetables are fairly inexpensive. Things like a bag of fresh celery or carrots (not baby carrots) or kale can cost you about $1-2 and can last you about a week. We also purchase 10-20lb bags of basmati rice which costs anywhere from $12-16. These big bags of rice last a LONG time. We bought a small, $20 electric rice cooker and use that just about everyday. Our biggest food expense would be meat, but we don't really eat meat everyday which allows us to splurge a little when we do purchase meats. Lots of times we'll buy deli sliced roast beef and just snack on that throughout the week which is fairly inexpensive. Also, its good to find work camping jobs or camping locations near good fishing. There were a few times where my husband and I just fished every night or so for dinner. That was pretty much free besides the cost of a fishing pole and a permit (depending on your location). You have to remember too that the human body doesn't actually need that much food to be healthy. The American way of eating is typically over eating. Vandwelling can bring your eating habits back to reality :)   We don't feel limited by the cost of fuel. We just make it work. If we only have enough money to get from point a to point b but we really want to get to point c, we'll just figure out a way to make some quick cash at point b. Lots of times you can find easy ways to make $20 here and there helping people with different things like moving or helping them with their yard work or something.. lots of these postings can be found on craigslist. My husband sings and plays guitar, so there's been a few times where we made a couple hundred bucks just sitting on the side of the road with his guitar case propped open for tips. I've even sold some handmade leather earrings i made at a street fair and earned about $100. You just have to let go of your fear and be creative. You won't die if you run out of money, you'll just find the motivation to work harder to try and make some more. Plus if you keep yourself clean, most people won't even know that you live in your van. You really could just get a job somewhere for a few months doing anything. The possibilities are endless.. you just have to be up for the challenge."

vandwellers,31hu9a,SkylarThomas,3,Sun Apr 5 09:53:45 2015 UTC,"My husband had lived in a van before we met. He was raised in Wisconsin and we got married in New Jersey, which is where I'm from. I've always had a love for culture/anthropology and my husband had already been pursuing a musical career. (He was signed to a major label for almost 5 years and made about $0.00...) He told me so many stories about his adventures in his van, and all the random people he met and experiences he had and I just fell in love with the idea. So after we got married, we just decided to buy another van and drove straight across the country to california so he could continue working with the label. Then about 2 months after we moved, we decided that sticking with the label wasn't for us, and we just started traveling. I guess our vandwelling just kinda happened."

The amp hours is 55, meaning you wouldn't want to go below half that so say 27.5, times that by 12 volts and you have an available 330 watts before you need to recharge it. I got a LED strip that is 57 watts, so that would mean I could run it for about 6 hours before I would need to turn it off correct? The reason I ask is because everyone talks about how LED strips are low energy but having a deep cycle battery than can only run and LED strip for 6 hours seems super low. Any help would be appreciated thanks!"

vandwellers,31j70s,Sehc,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"With that being an AGM battery, the powercell should be encased in glass and it shouldn't emit any vapors.

I believe this was the model, Duracell   The battery cost me around 180 + tax (you'll be charged a core fee if you don't have an old battery to turn in) Rated at 110ah over 20 hours. I also purchased an LED light strip. I have it running on the top of the ceiling connected to a dimmer switch. Even at their brightest they should only pull 24.6 watts.   If you purchased one Duracell AGM and only run in down half. You could expect to power the LED lights for 26.8 hours. Longer when you connect them to a dimmer switch."

vandwellers,31ij5o,shellysum,6,Sun Apr 5 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"Your concerns are all valid.  The best way to avoid problems with the police is to select your overnight parking location carefully.  You could pay to park somewhere on private property, or you can be very strategic and stealthful about where and how you bed down for the night.  Hot and cold weather requires preparation.  Cold weather is easier, insulation, sleeping bag, proper clothing, perhaps even a heater.  Hot weather means a powered fan ventilator, awning and finding a cool place like a library or shopping mall to spend time.  Boredom may be reduced by being social, physically active, pursuing some hobby or interest, reading or getting internet access.  You will probably want to sleep when it is dark and wake when it is light, but you should be able to blackout an area of your van to be able to keep it lighted and use video or laptop screens.  A pee bottle can cover the need to urinate in the van.  There are a number of options from trash bag in a pail, to portapotty, to public restrooms for poop.  There are a number of options to keep clean, baby wipes, washcloths and spray bottles, washbasin, shower tent, solar showers, pesticide sprayer showers, or any combination of the above.

vandwellers,31ij5o,SkylarThomas,4,Mon Apr 6 05:54:57 2015 UTC,"I knew a couple who traveled up and down the west coast in a camper, making money selling at flea markets. I was a flea market seller for many years.  The female told me how much she enjoyed living on the road, but when her husband wasn't around, confided that she really missed the basic comforts of living in condo/apts. She said she was really worn out.   It seemed like they were only one financial disaster away from being homeless on the streets. Ofcourse this is true of most people who lose their jobs or other source of incomes.   In this case, I'm sure they were spending way too much on gas and vehicle maintenance, to make ends meet in the long run."

vandwellers,31ij5o,crockett5,0,Sun Apr 5 13:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well said, thoughtful comments. I was afraid people would think I was posting to criticize their van dwelling choices. Not the case. I've been borderline homeless (living in my van, in a friends garage, while I was financially, putting things back together).  Ofcourse I was using his electricity, watching his TV, using his bathroom, and turning the air conditioning up when I was too warm, so I wouldn't consider myself an experienced van dweller.  One thing I did look at, was RV parks with showers, toilets, and electricity with a monthly rate of $300 to $320. Still not sure, because I have no idea how long used RVs hold up before they need expensive repairs.   More likely, I will stay in apts. with roommates, give up my car, and start riding bicycles. I have more experience with bicycles than RVs.   No car payments and no insurance. I know. Not very impressive. But I consider my reliance on vehicles a bigger waste of money than my addiction to air conditioning and watching movies in the comfort of my apartment."
vandwellers,31ij5o,neonbible47,4,Sun Apr 5 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"If you are living in a van just to save money, then you will likely not like it or burn out fast. This is a lifestyle which benefits those whom are adventurous and like to explore, doing it just for money will cause it to get old fast IMO.  If it's just about money, you could probably spend close to the same living with roommates and be stuck arguing over who ate your ice cream or who's turn it is to do the dishes.. LoL  As far as finical responsibility, that has nothing to do with living in a van, but rather everything to do with the person involved. If you are good with money, then you will be good with your money no matter if you live in a van, apartment or tent in the woods.   I'd say a large amount of people whom live in houses are always one financial disaster away from being homeless. How many people do you know whom can make their house payment or cover their living expenses for a few months if they have a problem and can't work?  Personally, I haven't had to work since November of last year. I worked the summer out in CO then when it got cold I headed back to FL to build a new van. I'll be leaving FL again next month to pick up some work once again for the summer somewhere.  As far as being a step away from being homeless, you can solve that by having savings which is a bit easier if you have small expenses. I suggest if you are in a van, to always have a minimum of $2-3k set aside for emergency repairs or worst case to buy cheap replacement van in the event something happens."

I rent a mailbox from a UPS Store in SD and have my driver's license and vehicle registration there using that address and it's all perfectly legal."

vandwellers,31eu1m,dokupehakase,10,Sat Apr 4 11:46:03 2015 UTC,"In my first van, I made a frame out of some lumber (smaller than 2x4's...1x3's maybe?). I used self-drilling metal screws to attach these to the metal ribs inside the van. Then I used regular screws to attach some thin plywood over the wooden frame.  Check out my imgur folder on that project for more: Garrison's First Van"
vandwellers,31eu1m,John-Garrison,2,Sat Apr 4 14:18:09 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for replying. So you just drill right into the metal on the inside of the van? I was worried about either the screw going through to the outside of the van, or needing a nut or something, or just generally damaging something somehow.   Is just drilling to the metal ribs strong enough for most things?"
vandwellers,31eu1m,LiamIsMailBackwards,3,Sat Apr 4 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"The metal ribs are just there as the skeleton of the van, hence ribs. They are strong enough to not bend when putting boards up along them, but you don't want to put any shelves directly into them for fear of weakening their support.  What it seems like you are wondering about is what direction to drill. DO NOT drill toward the outside of the van/toward the van walls. Drill parallel to the outside of the van with the wooden boards perpendicular to the walls/parallel to the ribs. THEN put shelves up by drilling into the boards. There should only be one board drilled into the rib. The rib isn't what is supporting the shelves. It's what is keeping the support in place.  Hope that clears it up a bit."
vandwellers,31eu1m,LiamIsMailBackwards,2,Sat Apr 4 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Ohh, so like | is a rib, and --- is a board and * is a drill, and there's a few ribs so you'd put the boards between the ribs and drill parallel with the van wall like this? |-------------| ?   I don't see the difference between ribs supporting a support and a support supporting shelves vs ribs supporting shelves though? I guess if I were to put any weight on the supports, I could have a beam or something going all the way to the floor to support weight?   Sorry, I'm not mechanically/construction inclined at all."
vandwellers,31eu1m,Lolor-arros,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"The beam being parallel to the rib is exactly what I'm trying to say. Drill the beam into the rib, then drill the shelves into the beam. The less holes in the ribs, the better."
vandwellers,31eu1m,LiamIsMailBackwards,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but to clarify - the boards should be resting on the floor of the van.  The floor supports the boards, and the boards hold the weight of the shelves.  And like you said, the ribs just keep the boards in place."
vandwellers,31eu1m,John-Garrison,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Exactly. The floor/board should look like this:  _ | _ with the board being drilled into the rib in order to keep it upright/from moving around. You shouldn't drill a shelf into the rib.
vandwellers,31eu1m,neonbible47,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:23:29 2015 UTC,"I only used a drill bit to make the holes in the wood for the screws to go through. (Slightly smaller holes than the diameter of the screws to be used, so once I put the screws in they gripped the wood a bit.) I made these holes all along the wood framing outside of the van, on my workbench.  Then I held up my pre-holed wood against the rib I wanted to attach it to, and just used a power screwdriver. I let the self-tapping sheet metal screws do the work of cutting through the metal. You need to apply a fair amount of pressure behind the screwdriver to get them to cut though, and it may take a few seconds of spinning before they dig deep enough to punch through.  I only screwed into the metal ribs, in locations where I could see behind the rib or at least estimate the distance to the outer metal, so that I wouldn't use a screw too long and accidentally punch a hole to the outside.  I didn't use nuts on the screws. Never had any problems with them popping out. I used a lot of screws though, like one every 6-8 inches.  While this was enough to keep up my plywood paneling and carpet covering, I didn't trust it to hold larger things. For things like my bed frame, clothes bar/closet, and storage shelving, I used 2x4's running along the floor and as some pillars, which I used to secure the furniture. See the next to the last pic in the imgur folder."
vandwellers,31eu1m,John-Garrison,2,Sat Apr 4 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"Question for someone who actually knows how to use self-tapping screws (as opposed to the entire staff of Home Depot): I bought myself some, tried them out, and fried my drill bit - nearly caught my paneling on fire because of the heat/smoke. The drill bit was demolished. Home Depot was baffled. I gave up, and just used a titanium drill bit and sheet metal screws.   Now I'm wondering if I simply needed a titanium screw driving bit? Do those who have used them have thoughts? I'm at the stage of bolting down furniture and would love to get some use out of those screws."
vandwellers,31eu1m,Seascan,2,Sat Apr 4 18:03:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't try to drill into the metal myself. I just drilled holes in the wood, where I wanted the screws to go, held the wood up to the metal, and used a power screwdriver with the screws. I just let the tips of the screws do the metal drilling for me.  I had to apply a fair amount of pressure behind the screwdriver though, and let it spin for a few seconds, before it would dig completely through the metal."
vandwellers,31eu1m,One_Awesome_Inch,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:36:50 2015 UTC,Those were self-immolating screws. A little cheaper but it's usually not worth the ensuing conflagration.
vandwellers,31eu1m,hightiedye,3,Wed Apr 8 05:27:52 2015 UTC,"+1 to Mr. Garrison. Besides the framing to drill into, another thing I am doing is using 3/8 baltic birch plywood, which is really high quality. Its super stiff so basically you get alot of strength without a huge amount of weight."

vandwellers,31eu1m,cookieguy10,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:41:08 2015 UTC,I stuck bits of scrap metal on the ends of bolts and lodged them in the hollow parts of my van's vertical wall ribs. Those bolts secure a metal frame that support my desk/storage cabinets.  Like this.

vandwellers,31giul,rsyoo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 12:32:56 2015 UTC,"If OP is planning on carrying around a deep cycle battery and charger, he could do so by putting it in one of those rolling crates you see at office supply stores. Put the gear in a paper bag to camouflage it a bit, along with your laptop/tablet, power strip, work stuff, etc. Roll in to coffee shop, buy drink/food, find a good place to sit down and plug in.   I see business people rolling these things around all the time. Have everything plugged up to your power strip ahead of time so all you need to do is plug it in at the coffee shop. Nobody will give it a second glance.  The rolling crate setup was something I was considering doing when I was first starting out, but there are obvious downsides (really, really heavy). Ended up going solar for house battery. Plus, lithium ion power packs are constantly improving, both in size and capacity.   Speaking of power packs, I've been trying to find a cheaper alternative to the goalzero sherpa 100. It's amazing, but $300+ is a bit much, imo. Anyone have any recommendations?"

I will be using a dual marine rv battery which will give me 730 cold crank and 100 amp hours. My only concern is if I will drive enough to keep it charged. Time will tell. I am skipping the large panel for now because its not stealthy.  I plan to get one of those 16w foldable solar units that will go on my dashboard.

That tends to rule out anything too old. That being said, I bought my panel used. It seems like almost all 100w panels, for example, are roughly the same size, but I found an older 115w panel that was more square than rectangular and made better use of the space between my roof rack. But mine is only 4-5 years old. Also be careful, from what I've seen a lot of sellers are trying to get the same amount of money (per watt) for used panels as new ones cost, even though they'll be less efficient."
vandwellers,31f7do,BigandStupid,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:13:04 2015 UTC,To what extent might they be less efficient? And what sort of lifespan do they generally have?
vandwellers,31f7do,BigandStupid,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"New panels come in 2 general types, monocrystalline and polycrystalline. I would refer you to this site for more info: http://energyinformative.org/best-solar-panel-monocrystalline-polycrystalline-thin-film/ Bear in mind that this info is for home installations, so they tend to downplay the importance of efficiency (since a typical house has a lot more room to work with). But when you start talking about VERY old panels, the ones with the round cells for example, you're probably looking at 8-10% efficiency. Most panels are warrantied for 20+ years, but they'll last a lot longer than that if you don't damage them. I had some on a house many years ago that were well over 25 years old and still produced roughly 90% of their rated power."

I couldn't tell you which one it was but there are two features that are super important. One is carrying capacity. You want something heavy duty that will handle well over the weight of your bike. If you don't you will be sick with worry about the day your bike takes a dive on the highway. Second is anti tilt. What that is, is a bracket with three bolts that clamp down on the tow hitch to prevent your rack from wobbling around and wearing itself out of your hitch. Very important.  Besides that make sure you buy a locking pin and a u lock or two to lock your bike down to your rack and your rack to your van.
