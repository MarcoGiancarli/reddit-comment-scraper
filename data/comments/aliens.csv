aliens,3e2lcx,CjsJibb,2,Tue Jul 21 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Misinformation.  My guess is they get respectable intelligent public figures to go out and say they endorse the search for Alien life (Stephen Hawking). They pour $100 million into the project in an effort to appear financially invested. They will act like they're completing research and legitimatly searching for signs of intelligent life. They may even find some new discoveries in the process.   In the end, there will be no findings of extra terrestrials, even if they do find something; the truth is, and will always be, what the government says it is."

In the years before, most have only primitive means of communication. In the years following they are likely to have much more advanced means. It's not just a search for ET life - it's a search for ET life inside one specific brief era - and since radio waves take so long to reach us, that further limits the search to only civilizations  which were at our current stage of evolution hundreds or thousands of years ago. Even if we get a signal and reply to it, who knows if any of them will still be using radio tech by the time our reply reaches them."

aliens,3dxzrh,ImJustSadSorry,13,Mon Jul 20 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people saying this sort of thing and I think his message got confused a little bit.  He uses the comparison of Columbus discovering America. The takeaway from that analogy is that Columbus had the capabilities of an advanced civilization to get to the Natives, but not visa-versa.  I believe what Hawking is stating is that if there is an alien species out there that is capable of traveling the galaxy and reaching Earth, we should be very wary of their contact. However, if we are the ones who find ourselves capable of reaching them, then WE are Columbus.  To me, it actually makes perfect sense to do this kind of searching. We are one lonely planet in a galaxy that has, potentially, a vast multitude of other intelligent species. If we are one of the species to touch others first, then we have the best chance of survival in an inter-galactic world. If we just remain to ourselves, we leave ourselves at the mercy of those that find us.  Think of Earth as a microcosm of the galaxy. Those civilizations that pursue efforts outside of their own country are the ones that typically thrive. The civilizations that stay to their islands and have the attitude of just fending off those that enter their land, don't historically have the best chances at survival.  Why did Columbus travel to America and not the other way around? Because Columbus' society was one that facilitated a sense of exploration. A society where those that innovated or discovered were lauded and remembered. (Obviously that isn't the only reason history played out like it did, but it is a factor that supports the point I'm trying to make)  Exploration has always been a major factor in history. I think that those civilizations who chose to explore over those that didn't had more to gain and were more often rewarded than punished. I feel like space exploration wouldn't be any different.  We have more to gain by being active explorers and being the ones to make first contact than to keep to our lonely planet and be surprised when someone comes knocking on our door."

Just 150 years ago flying was but a dream to most people; and yes, while our technology has advanced exponentially over the past half-century, we have far to go. Being capable of travel is not equivalent to being capable of handling the repercussions of said travel. Now, imagine some sort of post-apocalyptic wasteland type of scenario.

Just a few doors down, in our solar system, there is the possibility of oceans, and likely therefore life, on both Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moon Titan.  Our earth would fit in to our sun 1 million times.  Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy.  Our galaxy is one of 100 billion galaxies in just the observable universe.    And this is just what we can perceive with our limited senses and science.  There very well could be unobservable ‘realities’ co-existing with ours within our universe.  I've taken ayahuasca several times and, to me, this seems probable.  And this is assuming there is simply one universe.  String theory suggests that there are an infinite number of parallel physical realities within a multiverse; it is proposed that each very likely utilises entirely different fundamental laws of physics; thus giving way to life following a completely different set of 'rules'.

aliens,3dymtf,sfbreh,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"Bullshit, with a side of truth. I think there are people who do intimidate witnesses. This happens in absolutely every organized crime syndicate, which is what a hypothetical UFO coverup would have to be run by. It's a cheap, effective way to manipulate reality and influence truth.  According to Dr. Greer, we cracked electrogravitics (the propulsive force behind UFOs) some time ago; over half a century. Since then, we have also created/replicated what he terms as ""technology-assisted consciousness"" which is the use of electronic devices to amplify our thoughts to produce a certain result. This is how one supposedly manipulates the controls of a UFO. Supposedly, ETs use this as well and that's also how they project thoughts into our heads to communicate with us beyond a language barrier. Makes sense to me.  I'd imagine, if true, such a device would also be able to be abused and used to project fearfulness or confusion into someone's mind.   If the MIB are real (and at that, I wouldn't imagine they'd be much more than the witness intimidation part of crash retrieval teams), a lot of the spookiness probably comes from them being normal people using these technologies to intimidate witnesses. I think a lot of stories though are a jumble of various aspects of myths and legends and just generally creepy traits to try to scare people."

aliens,3dymtf,minglemangle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"well, to be honest. He was really kind of a douchebag. But a harmless one. What I mean is: I've known some megalomaniacs, cult leaders, etc. And Dr. Greer is nowhere near being that annoying. He's a narcissist. That's the way I would put it. He loves to talk, and in a group setting, he will just talk and talk and talk. In the process of detailing really interesting information and stuff that is useful and worth considering, he will name drop extensively, he'll talk about important people he's visited, he'll mention how high his IQ is, that sort of stuff. But in the end, it's harmless. If you're able to just filter it out, it doesn't detract from the validity of the information. And when the principles that he is talking about (working with consciousness, the paradigm of the reality we are dealing with, the way the ETs are visiting us, etc.) are put to the test, they actually produce results. These are results that all of the 30 people in the group experienced profoundly. So, in the end, I just had to say, ""flawed human being, with some personal issues. So what."""

It would be just as much a mistake to judge the content of their ""teaching"" by their personality as it is to judge the content of Greer's teaching because he has some personality flaws. If you think that being able to contact ETs and have them manifest consistently would somehow elevate someone's consciousness and make them enlightened, that's inaccurate. I feel that the ETs are just happy to have any contact situation and Greer has the right quality of consciousness (not afraid, not with an agenda of either wanting to control or wanting to be saved) to allow them to connect. He also absolutely has a great love for this earth and for a better future for humankind."

The reaction of the news crew looked genuine to me, truly scared and they all jumped back at the same time when they saw it. When they freaked you couldn't see why as the alien was not in view.

aliens,3dr4ke,pharmaphilreview,15,Sat Jul 18 17:30:37 2015 UTC,"Your question brings up another issue I have with many people's assumptions about aliens. Why do we assume them to be humanoid, as if intelligence is linked with our specific anatomy. Dinosaurs existed on this planet for far longer than people did. We've only been here for 200,000 years, a fraction of the mesozoic era (the age the dinosaurs lived) which lasted 200 million years.  Notice how in the ""Life Graphical Timeline"" the age of modern looking humans doesn't even get a single pixel! In other words we've barely gotten here in relative time scale of life on earth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life  If we were to assume that life evolved similarly to ours on other planets, then it would be more logical to assume a predominance of dinosaur-like animals than human-like ones.   However, I personally don't believe that life evolves similarly on other planets. Different planets are too unique and evolution is random and adaptive to those unique environments. I think alien life will be so foreign to us that we may barely recognize it as life at all. But it's still an interesting thought experiment!"

aliens,3dr4ke,coldethel,6,Sat Jul 18 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Indeed! I argue this point a lot my self.   My first argument is that we should go my deeper back than wether or not they are going to be humanoid or not. When we speak about chance we have no idea if plants, animals or fungi would have even developed. What if instead life took on its own unique sub forms.   They might remind less of us than mushrooms!"
aliens,3dr4ke,Dibblerius,4,Sun Jul 19 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely that it is illogical to assume that the humanoid figure is somehow universal.    However, with the immensity of space doesn't it seem that if there was other humanoid intelligence and they could traverse vast distances of space that they would concern themselves with beings that are most like themselves so as to maybe learn or progress their own kind?    I think if we on earth discovered instantaneous travel (or anything near it) tomorrow then we would likely be most interested in other humanoids rather than concerning ourselves with sentient gasses. (or whatever random adaptation that allowed for life in other ways than the humanoid figure.)"

aliens,3dr4ke,the_dingding,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I said it is illogical to ASSUME, in my opinion I think the humanoid form is very common to our local star system. Also, I believe that the ""extra dimensional beings"" that some people reference would appear in a thought form which would mean it would appear differently depending on the observer.    I think in the event that there are extra dimensional beings, I don't think it is too far fetched to think that their appearance would be greatly influenced by the mind of the observer so as to prevent some sort of ""short circuit,"" in our delicate minds.  So I think if there was a message that an extra dimensional being wanted to convey to the human race, they would attempt to convey the message in a way that can be most easily understood (humanoid form.)

aliens,3dr4ke,Village_ponce,6,Sun Jul 19 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"Consider the impact of a mass extinctions on an ecosystem like the earth. Here we have witnessed several mass extinctions, each time thinning out the branches of the evolutionary tree.  What I'm talking about is a genetic bottleneck affect felt on an entire ecosystem. The Cambrian era can be considered the most biodiverse era on the planet when considering multicellular life in different shapes and forms. It came after the earth was frozen, almost like the Cambrian explosion, as they call it, came as a response to a changing climate awakening simple lifeforms that roamed before Snowball Earth. When the ice retreated and the water started to warm this gave a chance for the sleeping to awake and multiply in different ways. This time in our planet may have been the most extraordinary moments ever discovered.   Since that time we have experienced 5 mass extensions. Every single one of these events , reducing the population to less than half. The species that were most adaptable survived, and in some cases that meant a population reduction of 5% of all the known species on earth be for the event. Each extinctions created a genetic bottleneck effect on a planetary scale making the few survivors more specialized. Some characteristics shared in all species has survived these mass extinctions, and were passed down to animals alive here on earth today including humans. We are an extremely specialized results of four billion years of evolution.  So what does this have to do with anything? What I'm suggesting is that if we ever find a planet and can judge the amount of biodiversity on it (asking allot here), we could potentially guess where they would be in that evolutionary timeline. Mass extinctions caused by catastrophic events sets the ball rolling for speciation, by which I mean the creation of new species from older ones. This means if the planet is young, you are more likely to find unicellular and simple lifeforms. If the planet is teeming an overabundance species ( not the amount of animals, but the amount of species of animals) then we can assume that multicellular life is quite young but unicellular life is quite old at this point. If we find the planet in a state of balanced ecosystem, we might find all types of animals, including dinosaur like creatures. This may mean that the global ecosystem as experienced specialization in genetic diversity caused by past events. The nature of the change that happend will determine the nature of the diversity. This may mean that dinosaurs Were the result of only earths evolution.  I think all this is very possible including the idea that we might stumble across a planet that has experienced many episodes of extensions, causing a specialization in speciation and creating and advanced self-aware society. I like the idea of finding dinosaurs on other planets, but I'm more interested in finding out what humans would do if they found  another race asking themselves the same questions..."

Nope.  25% of our universe is Reptilian.  70% Human  Reptilians (and their pets, and lower species) seeded life on this planet long before Humans came from Lyra to also seed life here (before leaving for the pleiades).   After reptilians seeded life here, humans came and warred with the Reptilians for millions of years.  Eventually most of the reptilians left (to conquor elsewhere), and some reptilians stayed on earth but went under ground (into the hollow earth). Humans, who won the war, got to colonize the surface.   If we find reptillian species on other planets they wouldn't really be classified as dinosaurs.

Because you have been indoctrinated for so long.   I am sure your worldview, and claims about Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Extraterrestrial Biological Entities would be completely extraordinary to me, and entirely devoid of evidence.  Humans originating on Earth, and evolving here alone without ever being contacted by anyone else, is a pretty extraordinary claim, to me. And yet it is one I am sure you would make. Even though you couldn't produce one iota of evidence to support such a claim.   I find them unconvincing     Now I am certain that you are completely unfamiliar with anything that I listed.   If you would like to do some actual research, I suggest starting with the aforementioned list. Graham Hancock might be a simpler place to start, as you seem pretty uneducated as far as any of this goes. Graham Hancock will help you to slowly tip your toe into the water.

Way too zoomed in and blurry, you'd barely be able to tell what's going on or what part of the screen you are looking at and it would be very out of focus.

aliens,3dsyzk,RayGunn_26,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:58 2015 UTC,Pluto and its moons are tiny and dark. Galaxies and stars are Huge and produce their own light. To look at planets you need to be right on top of them because of their size and dimness.

The planets hundreds of light years away are found by looking for small bends in light waves caused by gravity, we have no images of them.  We are getting images of Pluto because the probe we sent there 7 years ago has finally arrived. We can't even get good images of Mars without a probe in orbit."
aliens,3dsyzk,adhal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:33 2015 UTC,"most of the close up pictures of we currently have of far off planets light years away are mostly just an artists rendition on what they think they planets will look like based on what chemicals the atmosphere is made of.  Also most satellite/telescopes that are fixated on a part of the universe just staring at basically big bright balls of light looking for it to slightly dim in order to signify theres a planet orbiting said star. For far off planets they can only detect this flicker of light, trying to get close up shots of distant planets that far away is just impossible with current technology until they send satellites closer to those planets"
aliens,3dsyzk,pharmaphilreview,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"Well for one, Telescopes do just what they're said. They provide a telescopic view. If we were to use telescopes to see nearby planets, they'd be really blurry. They're too close for the ""zoom in"" feature if you will. Secondly, not all planets are readily available to be seen from our observatories as well.   Also, the way we pick up images from far away planets and galaxies/star systems is not always through a raw image. A lot of times it's taken from red light being reflected off other planets/surfaces."

aliens,3do3z5,kikkomankikkoman,3,Sat Jul 18 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"How I see it, is that we just can't know for sure. We have no data what so ever about any other intelligent race, and making assumptions based on our behavior feels a bit silly.   They might not even consider us intelligent and try to get rid of us just to save the planet. Not in full on warfare kind of way, they might just release some kind of plague and never show themselves. They might be aggressive hive mentality beings who are looking for outposts and just ignore us as beings. There could be thousands of scenarios that we just couldn't understand and not approve as a good reason to hostility.   But yeah, the problem with us is that we don't have any sense of scale at the moment. We might just be planet destroying apes to some aliens and equals to others. Time will tell, I hope.  EDIT: Third language problems"
aliens,3do3z5,BassBeerNBabes,5,Sat Jul 18 10:56:29 2015 UTC,"I see the neutral hypothesis as the most likely. There's very little we can offer them as a species. Their technology allows them to travel further than we can even perceive. There are many locations in our universe with much better resources, with no claim on them as far as we know.  The main reason they visit us is scientific and sociological curiosity. They want to know what makes us tick, how our body metabolizes, reproduces, and changes. The flora and fauna on our planet is probably intriguing to them. If our structures are similar to theirs, they're curious as to where the divergence or parallel evolution occurred. Our potentials, IQ, and EQ matter to them as well. If they are psychic or similar, they want to know our cognitive capabilities. They also want to know what makes our society tick. The structure, order, and the mechanisms by which we determine status.  In the case of positive, they probably haven't cared enough to change much. If anything, they're still investigating and learning as much as we are about ourselves. In some ways, just the idea of alien life has driven our species just to wonder exactly what lies outside of our solar system, and to speculate into the science that will bridge the gap between us and them.  In the case of the negative, they probably at least need us (and our planet) alive. If they didn't we'd be space debris right now. In this case it's possible we're some sort of biochemical calculator for them, turning out ideas and concepts. Imagine for a moment that our planet is just one of many ""seeded"" worlds created just for the sake of watching how conditions affect a growing population of semi-sentient creatures fumbling around on a foresaken rock at the edge of our galaxy."

aliens,3do3z5,Kekebean,2,Sat Jul 18 17:02:18 2015 UTC,tl;dr I think there are many different kinds with different understandings of Earth or perspectives. Just like how humans aren't all evil-hearted.
aliens,3do3z5,Dibblerius,2,Sat Jul 18 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reason you have not seen a conclusive theory about this is because it is (if you ask me an impossible task, just guesswork) a very hard question with not much but our assumptions to go by.   One way to approach this question, by far not satisfying but still, is to imagine our selves being able to traverse the universe and finding species less advanced than us but still enough to be some sort of civilisation.   It is important with this approach to understand that aliens shouldn't be assumed to be us or like us but it can be used to illustrate possible reasons that would on first glance not make sense. It is not completely obvious that our own species should act or react the way we do.   Human reasons can not easily be understood from just casually looking over what would make logical sense of what should be in our interest by an outside observer.  -It is not obvious why we rage war on each-other without understanding our territorial group mentality shared with chimpanzees and other factors.  -It is not obvious why we care to have pets and have empathy for other species on our planet, even when they have throughout our past been a food source, and in some cases remain so today, or a threat to us without understanding how our mind relates to life and suffering.   -It is not obvious why we seek deeper meanings and purpose to the extent that we make up beliefs to fill that void when none can be found or how we desire so badly to understand our place in the universe and to explore its every corner that we consider finding life somewhere else to be ""The greatest moment in human history"".  If we were the interstellar travellers that came across more primitive civilisations than our selves what would we do and why?   I don't think this is as obvious as it might sound but I can imagine conflicting incentives that might have roots in a more complex nature within us than would be expected by those we visit.  Would we be interested in them?, most definitely yes! Would we care for their well being? Possibly!, probably most of us if we didn't find them repulsive. Would we let our desire to be in control and our curiosity lead us to experiment on them? Not unthinkable at least. Would we take over their planet if earth was exhausted or gone if it was ideal for colonisation? Judging by our past conquests likely!    Neutral, Altruistic or Hostile  Well I have no compelling pros or cons for either of these. It appears to me though that the reasoning you present is logically very sound but also rests heavily on clinical assumptions that if you look a second time might not hit the mark even if they were applied to us, and we are a species we know and understand (somewhat).   Why would they be neutral? We could just be to different or it could be in their nature to not care about other species or they may not even understand that we are intelligent or something like that.  Altruistic? Who knows but we have no obvious reason to be friendly yet at least a good portion of redditors here wish nothing more than to make contact and befriend aliens.  Are they hostile? Assuming we would have nothing they would need other factors may still play a role here. We might be repulsive to them. They could get off on dominating other species, a survival trait from their past perhaps. They could fear what we might become in the future and want to stop us here and now.   I realise that I have offered you very little in terms of answers to this very interesting question but hope in some minor way I have offered a perspective."
aliens,3do3z5,coldethel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:09 2015 UTC,"It's possible an intelligent civilization having evolved as a predator rather than a producer, would enjoy fighting and killing, even if it didn't need to.   Like many people, then."
aliens,3do3z5,bgh93,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, somewhere between neutral and hostile. Here's the reason why I believe they may lean more towards the hostile side-if it were possible to move at speeds which may even exceed the speed of light, a large amount of energy would likely be required. Where this energy comes from, how it is converted into usable energy, and whether or not they may have already arrived and harvested or continue to harvest somehow from us, is definitely a question that is open to an answer. The other question that remains is this-in order for a species to survive it is natural for it to ""out compete"" its competition. I don't believe it is a conscious choice, just a natural thing that life forms do in order to survive in a hostile environment. With that being said, yes a sentient being does have more awareness and empathy for other life forms, but I don't believe its enough of a drive that would exceed the natural drive to preserve ones own life force and species over another species/life force. Due to the fact that we have not mastered inter space travel and are most likely lower on the ""food chain"" when it comes to intelligence and survival, yes I would feel threatened and afraid that they could potentially exploit whatever resources they could from humans and that human suffering would not affect them much at all. The only exception to this rule may be that they were actually involved in the evolution of humans somehow, and may actually have some bit of DNA that they contributed in order to produce a species that would best serve their needs. If this was they case, and they have know about us all along, they may feel somewhat ""invested"" in the survival of our species and may not cause harm in the future while maintaining their ""non-existence""."
aliens,3do3z5,Dibblerius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"Would you care to elaborate some on what kind of energy they would need to harvest from earth that could not be harvested elsewhere?   I mean they don't need our civilisations technology since it is inadequate to produce the kind of energy they require so I'm assuming they collect something them selves with their own tech.   I can only think of one source not found better elsewhere in our solar system. Fossil fuel! (dead plants) Seems an unlikely candidate does it not?  Solar energy would be better on mercury.  Magnetic geological, tidal forces or wind power would be stronger on Jupiter.  Uranium or other heavy decaying elements for nuclear fission or hydrogen for fusion is as plenty on most other planets as here."
aliens,3do3z5,welsh_dragon_roar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Or it could be something based on a science of which we're not aware yet? Perhaps some kind of energy based on a certain geological configuration, or sound frequency generated by something or other?  That's the difficult when trying to think about alien motives in human terms - it's a roll of the die!!"
aliens,3do3z5,bgh93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my line of thinking. Just to imagine being able to travel at the kind of speed it would take to travel from one galaxy to another boggles my mind! The only earth concept that might still apply is that there would need to be some kind of energy source to power that kind of speed. How any of it would work is beyond my understanding and I don't even want to guess. All I know is that our race is still very young in comparison to the endless amount of time and possibilities that exist in space, and to deny what is most definitely out there based on our own human understanding of what is in our own galaxy and earth is almost as bad as saying that the earth is flat and that the universe revolved around our planet, as early scientists once thought."
aliens,3do3z5,welsh_dragon_roar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:04:33 2015 UTC,"I think you have to forget the idea of travelling there in normal spacetime at high velocity. I mean, in theory, we could travel to Andromeda now if we had a ship that could constantly accelerate at 1G. However, while it may be 28 years to the traveller, just over 2.5m years would have passed back on Earth! The answer lies with bending spacetime and all that sort of exotic stuff. I know NASA are working on hypothetical drives at the moment, but I don't know how feasible they are without exotic energy sources."
aliens,3do3z5,Dibblerius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:55:45 2015 UTC,Yeah that sounds likely! I was just wondering why you suspect whatever energy source they use for that technology to be especially accessible on earth.
aliens,3do3z5,welsh_dragon_roar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:44:09 2015 UTC,Because Earth is the closest place to them at that point in time that has it? Could be a number of reasons!

Instead of thinking well, they're emotional evolved to a constant, no emotional break outs, no smiling, nothing, and this is a sign of evolutionary emotional growth? Maybe but what if...   What if there were a race out there who could be labeled for each any every one of these emotions?  And then take it to the next level of emotional growth. Think a bigger emotion wheel that shows their relation to each other, their opposite and what pairs up to form deeper emotions with it's neighboring emotion. I'm thinking deeper, not faceless emotion is the result of evolutionary emotional growth."

However, your comparison of the 'highway' being restrictive in a sense by tagging along with old ideas. Innovation is to find a means to an end.. and perhaps there is an end they are looking for.  This is a little silly and a bit off-topic but I was reminded of this one time I was speculating about the meaning of life. I came to the idea that, eventually, the universe will die. Nothing will stop that. But, perhaps a by-product of the universe itself can live on.  I played around with the thought that biological life emerges naturally, and evolves naturally towards the ability of technology, and eventually creates a new universe to artificially extend the life of the universe, through simulation."

It could've been an accident, intention, just random or many other things or all of the things combined. To take a leap further and try to speculate about intentions to create a whole 'new' race would be even harder. As far as we know, many previous civilizations had huge armies and harems. We might be just that, a ancient huge harem. We were made very sexually active to reproduce and we were made with distinct organs to fit preferenses of whoever owns the harem. I mean this can be a possibility, how strange it may seem. I could believe this if Genghis Khan was born thousands or millions year later. Of course primitivity is a subject of this matter but hatred, greed and horrible people have and is existing(from our perspective of course) so there's a possibility they exists in 1000 years too.  Something that I don't believe in however is that we're made perfect to fit in the center of the universe. We are very late to the game of evolution and this is like entering a game of Risk when all other players have been playing for hours. A planet of a harem might not be the correct answer, however with speculations we can't really know the answer. All I know is that we all were born here and we fucked the world up, we're in the shitter and need to get out ASAP.

This may or may not have been incited by one of the said higher-ups, as he'd been studying the life on earth and the primitive humanoids intrigued him.    After observing primitive man in their family/tribe units and seeing them free other animals from traps the aliens set, he supposedly tested their DNA, saw it was close-ish to theirs and theorized that in a million years or so they'd come to resemble the aliens.

As the villagers encircled the castle with torches and pitchforks, so to speak, dude stepped forward and said, ""Hey, so I've been poking these things here and they're genetically similar.  I know we're not supposed to do stuff like this but I can fiddle around with them, make them smarter, trainable and whatnot and they can take over the hard work.  Isn't it convenient that I get to do the thing I want and save your asses at the same time in this scenario and not suspicious at all?""  Eventually it was agreed upon/voted in after protests of, ""ewwww, gross!""  The workers were pacified that their hardships would soon come to an end, people were made, after a few failed attempts, and modified here and there over the years.    And other stuff."
aliens,3dmuuq,billybobjoe3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:35 2015 UTC,I personally believe that beings that can travel lightyears quickly with advanced technology and such wouldn't want us doing labor that would just slow them down.  I feel like its more likely that alien prisoners bred with us or some shit idk.
aliens,3dmuuq,JadedMagic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not.  I have no idea how extraterrestrials would think but it stands to reason if they had a hand in our development we'd be similar to them.  Especially if there's a grain of truth in all the stories of being gifted civilization by the gods.  Humans aren't exactly a species above exploiting others.  We can't travel faster than light (or use/create wormholes or whatever) but we do some neat stuff.  Still, slavery and exploitation exist.    All God's children are dicks."
aliens,3dmuuq,billybobjoe3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:54:27 2015 UTC,Billions of planets to mine. Why come all the way to earth to mine for gold? Wouldn't you just mine asteroids or planets closer?
aliens,3dmuuq,JadedMagic,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"If it were me?  I'd mine on Earth or similar planets because though I am the owner of Duranki Extractions LLC and can do a lot of cool stuff, it's more cost effective to mine places with compatible atmospheres rather than less hospitable asteroids, moons or planets.  Less equipment, housing workers in orbit or building quarters with life support is just a bear and adds unnecessary time to the project.  Sure, for smaller projects it's 95% automation but for the big, long stuff you need workers and it's easier on more life-friendly planets.  I assume."
aliens,3dmuuq,billybobjoe3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:08:37 2015 UTC,Who knows if our planet is compatible though? I think being that advanced they could probably mine whatever they wanted without using actual people/whatever they are. If they can travel to earth they probably have advanced AI or something close enough to not need actual biological beings doing work for them.

I can buy them coming here to mess around with our biology or experimenting, maybe we are the closest planet with life, but just for resources? Seems like an incredibly inefficient task. I personally think most life forms that advanced would have evolved past normal biology though and be robot/cyborgs or have uploaded their consciousness and lived in virtual reality or on some other plane."

Think of the benefits though, if it is possible to upload your consciousness or duplicate it into code, you could allow your physical being to die and exist without the need of food or water or any resource. If your entire civilization is playing in this new world the possibilities are endless really, it'd be like the real world but with cheat codes for unlimited resources, lives, and whatever else you could think of."

I could imagine sending the entire population into some sort of internet where their minds can surf endlessly and socialize on message boards or VR games ect.  Or have it to where at a certain age you get the chance to enter the mind net ect and having humans and bodyless minds enteracting online sound very interesting to me."

aliens,3dkxiu,Thjiiikkmmmmkkllllll,6,Fri Jul 17 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"As for the first question, grey aliens are always shown as asexual. They have no genitals and reproduce by cloning. So they're neither gay nor straight.   The more human like ones are supposedly more spiritual than humans. Gender is probably unimportant to them. They're probably more pansexual and focus more on the energy of someone rather than their junk.  And the last question...have you heard of reptilians? They're always shown as bloodthirsty space lizard Jews...or something like that...but definitely Google it.  This is a fun sub. And all my sources are things that I read once somewhere."

We're supposed to be guardians and caretakers of our planet and should be working together in peace to further ourselves as a civilization. We aren't.  3) Other star systems? Nobody else lives here. Bases, maybe, but Earth is UNIQUE in our little corner of the galaxy, let alone star system. There are a few stars/systems/constellations that are important in many cultures: Sirius, Pleiades, and Orion foremost among them.  4) Absolutely. Charles Hall, who I'm skeptical of, said that the Tall Whites liked to go to the casinos and gamble.   5) Probably think most suck, because they do. If they watch them, I think they appreciate our movies like a student or connoisseur appreciates films from other cultures.  6) No, they'd have gotten an invasion over with already. Everything going on in the world that sucks is our fault, no one elses. If there ARE any hostile races, there are probably far more benevolent or neutral-to-a-point races that want and expect them to stay the fuck out of business that isn't theirs.  I think life and culture are precious to them more so than it is to us because they're fully and openly aware of the rarity of it. If you explore the galaxy and there are only a few rocks in a billion with life on them, I think the value of life is probably made abundantly clear."

aliens,3dkxiu,BassBeerNBabes,0,Sat Jul 18 06:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'd be inclined to think that the sole concept of gender would eventually disappear from advanced civilizations. That's because, let's be honest, gender was invented mainly for survival reasons (hence the presence of a third gender in societies where it served a purpose, like some Native American tribes that had agender shamans). Still having genders to organize around serves little to no purpose other than to make the world more understandable by forcing people into categories. If most alien species are more advanced than us, they're probably intelligent enough to stop needing to identify as a gender. That would mean there would be no sexual orientations either, people wouldn't get bothered by it and would just love who they love regardless of gender, since there is no gender (and, believe it or not, we are attracted to gender expressions a lot more than genitals)."

Also theres apparently a race of aliens that has 8 different genders who can all mate with eachother. So imagine the possibilities if you are born 1 gender and have to go through 7 others in your life to find your true self.

aliens,3djlm2,Rasta_Lance,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"You guys want answers but will think I'm  crazy but whatever.   I'll give you some background info.  Saturn  is the planet that is worshiped by all the super elites/illuminati.  They put their symbolism everywhere in public but not many people pick up on it.  The people that worship Saturn are truly evil and I don't know if I'd call them HUman or not. They look like us (mostly) but their intentions are so unnatural. They want all the money and power and they may care for their offspring but that's it. They want to see us die and it's obvious by their budget in dirty energy that has been killing this planet since day 1.  They don't care for others or have sincere feeling and don't really care about what happens to us.  As shown by recent stories they care more about upholding their drug free standards than saving live(unless they can charge you for keeping you alive).these are the bloodlines of humans that have been ""infested"".  Now I'm not expecting anyone to even read past here but HUmans  DNA has been corrupted by an evil form  of alien life.  That's why there the 2 types of humans: the ones that love all and want to be able to do something to make this world better, and the ones that want more and more control over others.  I've been in cars with some of these people and seen them make disgusted faces at homeless people that aren't even asking for money.it really makes my blood boil how little they care for their own kind.  Not all of them worship Saturn tho, only the higher ups who know what's going on.  Then there's the people in between that, when they think about it, they love people and want to change the world, but they are still competing for the most money or better car etc.. I've never heard of taking humans and using their body to disguise the Saturn worshippers, but it's not impossible with everything else going on but I think these people have their own body's and don't need to surgically put on humans arms and shit."
aliens,3djlm2,Onyyyyy,3,Thu Jul 16 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but I don't think all elites fall into the cult of Saturn.

Disclosure Project, alright. Beyond that, it seems like all he does it talk about how he left medicine and money (as if that's always on his mind) and use this very pedantic, almost rude tone when he talks in his seminars. Not just that, but then you also read things about how a lot of people have abandoned him basically because he's a dick.  He comes across as a bullshitter sometimes. That's reinforced by someone (forget who, look him up) with a hard-on for him basically finding everything possible to discredit and disparage him.   That does two things for me... it reinforces my occasional belief that he's a bullshitter, but it also makes me think that it's very conceivably part of a disinformation/character assassination campaign, and the guy is just really tired of a lot of the bullshit that comes with what he does."

aliens,3dh5e4,ufosarereal51,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"at least once a year they meet in Florida. Also, through the phone apps and online tools, it's possible to start your own group. Many of these groups report similar results."

aliens,3dh5e4,minglemangle,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:32 2015 UTC,It's awful. Greer lost all credibility when I found out he holds meditation camps so people can see UFOs. Nope. He's the worst.
aliens,3dh5e4,JoelNesv,5,Thu Jul 16 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"seeing as I attended one of these ""meditation camps"" (see other post in this sub) with a neutral mind, and that I saw craft (not just lights) during broad daylight, I think your judgment of him is uninformed."
aliens,3dh5e4,minglemangle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:07 2015 UTC,these are people who will never leave the keyboard. go outside and look up.they want you to bring them proof. kostas has a site and is organizing groups around the world. and its free. its all based on greers work.these people arent after money.no one has made a nickel doing this work.greer was independantly wealthy when he went full time on his disclosure work. he was also very well respected at the hospital he worked at. they new what he was up to in his field work and were very supportive.
aliens,3dh5e4,themadhat1,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:20 2015 UTC,"you're right. And even proof isn't proof. Whatever you show them, it's a ""mass hallucination,"" or it's a natural phenomena. I have no interest in proving to anyone what I experienced and saw. However, I think we do a disservice to the community when we pass judgment on individuals and on specific lines of thought without having any real experience."
aliens,3dh5e4,minglemangle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:00 2015 UTC,ive had some interesting contact all my life. i have taken people out with me at night to see what we are seeing...two types...the ones that think they are all satelites. or the ones that jaw drop realizing what is happening. and when they respond to you half of them never come back out because they get scared. nothing wrong with being scared  but ignorant?  no mercy.

aliens,3dh5e4,RevengeOfJmmanuel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:41:36 2015 UTC,"Just because medical science doesn't have an answer as to how that can happen doesn't make it untrue. They don't have an explanation for how they got here either. Most people who have spent time meditating, or even using hallucinogens, will tell you there's something else to it that is yet to be understood. You can't expect this will all make sense to us right away as with just about anything else new or cutting edge.  EDIT: Now that I think of it some of the world's most impressive minds have said that they received the information through some sort of meditation. They speak of it a little different but some of those people include Albert Einstein (thought experiments), Archimedes (stared into candle light on ceiling to help meditate), Tesla and Beethoven."

aliens,3dfdtb,Coppin-it-washin-it,7,Wed Jul 15 20:59:03 2015 UTC,I and just about every other sane person would be fine. Religious nutcases would lose it as per usual.
aliens,3dfdtb,Gazza03,6,Fri Jul 17 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"Fear will blast through people who isn't prepared. Like a wave hitting every city. It will be like 9/11 but 10 times worse. People will stand paralyzed in front of the TV.  After this people will panic, they realize that life will never be the same after what happens next. There's few options here, if they're benevolent then obviously we will grasp science in a whole new way and if they're not. Well, then we might as well pack our bags and run. The panic will cause riots and people will start to plunder stores and break in to houses. I believe this will occur either case, if they're benevolent or not. Some places will be burned down to the ground, some places wont even be affected. To maintain control over the people, martial law will be used.   The President of the united states will have a short news segment. Explaining that we should all remain calm and that they've got the situation under control. He will not answer any questions. This is for a panel who is briefed to answer any types of questions. They will answer questions as written like a script. They will only answer to the general press and only a short period of time, ~30min.   Now, here's where it breaks. Why? Well, either they(the alien) will make an appearance or they will not. Depending on what they do this will change the outcome drastically. Even if they explain that they're benevolent people will have doubts. Other cases, panic will continue in some places and other cases will form communities. Up until this point, people will basically go mad. The nutters who's already in this case, all the channelers and experiencers will roam to explain what's going on. People will try to capitalize on the agenda of the aliens. Followings will occur just like cults, depending on the time in which they make an appearance. Why? Well, everyone are in panic and people in panic will grab anything nearby and hold on to it. Even if someone explaining the situation is wrong, they will have some sort of 'plan' and I think most people will accept the general nutters as long as their 'plan' seems reasonable.  I think people believe many of these nutters will walk the streets ""spreading the way and word of love"" but in reality, that's a fraction of the population. Some would probably be very afraid like many others and stay inside, some might try to approach the ship or activity in order to make a peaceful contact.    This is what I believe might happen in the case of riots. I probably didn't think this through enough to have most areas covered but I thought I'd write this down either case just to get a perspective. However there could be an extreme amount of ways this would play out. If you want a explanation made from someone in this field of exopolitics/ufology, then check out Stephen Bassett and Richard Doland. They both have very good talks on what would happen in a scenario like this. Very in depth about exactly what will happen."
aliens,3dfdtb,zeuph,2,Thu Jul 16 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"I think any alien who watches even a few hours of our news would know that landing without any announcement is just a shitstorm. Fox News would spend 24 hours... talking about illegal aliens... :D  No one really rioted over 9/11. People are pretty calm in the face of violence. Imagine Iraq before the Shock and Awe campaign. They literally knew they'd be bombed to hell, and people just kind of accepted it, on both side, the bombers and the bombees. It was even somehow tenuously tied to 9/11. Everyone just went with the official message. An alien presence would be less scary than war.  There will always be nutters. Like the people who think Jade Helm is... well, whatever they think it is... I bet things would be a lot more controlled. There will be paranoia, but the official message would be pretty calming and clear. That's if aliens put any thought into it at all. I mean, maybe they just show up and see what happens if they land ... no plan, at all... just one alien winging it. HEY GUIZ! He prepared himself by spending a year on 4Chan. He communicates exclusively in memes.   I guess I'm trying to point out it's not that difficult to control the masses as long as you go about it in a reasonably intelligent way. You don't even need to be that smart to do it, and we're assuming aliens are as smart, if not smarter than us on average."
aliens,3dfdtb,VigilantNarcoleptic,2,Thu Jul 16 04:27:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do not subscribe to the idea of this scenario, however OP asked a question and this is my opinion of it.  I didn't mean 9/11 as in riots, more as a news event. I live in Sweden and we had a minute of silence on nearly every school in the country. It impacted most people and most people know about this event because of how it was treated by the media. This is what I meant, but greater. People will have a constant feed of information from the place of incident.  The riots ensue due to the fact that people realize there will either be death or a great change. In other words, there might not be a work to go back to in a couple of weeks. I believe people jump the boat the second they could. If they see a opportunity to survive without that life-siphoning 9-5 job, then I think many people will take this opportunity. I'm talking about people who work in manual labour, service jobs like delivery and picking up trash. What about students? Students have engaged in riots for much less before, there's been small riots recently about the police who shot a few men. Some parents might not send their kids to school because of fear. Some students might not go because they weren't really going to school before this event, why should they now? I'm talking about the wide spectrum of students, there's the rich 'good' students. Then there's more of the ""ghetto""-type and everything in between.   This is of course how well the government can maintain the masses. In some places I believe they would barely need to interfere. In other places I doubt they could control it(Looking at you, Detroit).  There's a immense range of possibilities, this is more of a locilization of the problem. Imagine all this with the pressure of triggerhappy people in the middleeast going even more triggerhappy. They could die for their country before, imagine what they'll do now.  I believe peace is the answer. I do not however believe this will be practiced all over the world."
aliens,3dfdtb,zeuph,0,Thu Jul 16 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"This is the same shit people said about evolution. And guess what, the church accepted evolution as true and no one cared."
aliens,3dfdtb,Auto-Body-Language,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:45 2015 UTC,I don't understand. Is my opinion not correct? Or is a alien ship landing somewhere on earth too close to the events of the church accepting evolution that this theory doesn't require discussion? I did not include religion in my post because I don't believe religion will have a big impact. People will either accept it and move on or just move on without a religion.
aliens,3dfdtb,zeuph,7,Thu Jul 16 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the thought that religion being proven wrong is going to stop religion. I mean, come on. They are wrong about nearly everything. No one cares!  The Mormons have ancient Middle Eastern people coming to America and warring using horses, and such other things that didn't exist on that continent at that time. Not even going into the magical Egyptian gold plates that John Smith used to divine this knowledge. He had magical glasses and a seer stone, but he had to return the plates so no one else can see them.  Christians think a magic man walks on water, heals, resurrects others, then himself, all while making you alcoholic beverages from water.  Not even going into the ridiculousness of all other religions. Or sometimes the pure barbarism of some religious text.  Here is what will happen... When people were found in South America, the Pope at the time extended to them the canopy of the church as they too were children of God.   The Pope may have already done this, but if not, he'll just decree that God watches over aliens too. Basically, people will try to convert them.  The weird part is going to be if Aliens try to convert humans to their religions. Aliens go door to door pamphlet in hand, ""Have you heard of the wondrous nature of Worg'Wah?"""
aliens,3dfdtb,VigilantNarcoleptic,6,Wed Jul 15 22:04:06 2015 UTC,I think that our and their religions will feed off eachother. Atleast a few of them must be similar spiritually.
aliens,3dfdtb,Gavither,0,Wed Jul 15 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"I am sure some will be similar. Oh, you had a giant elephant faced God too!??  Or, more likely, most intelligent species go through a phase in which they think everything was created for them, in which they are the center of the Universe, the whole purpose and meaning behind everything is them, and that they were created in God's image. We are all special little snowflakes, and when we die, we live. Yes, when we die, we live, forever, someplace nice. Warm fuzzy thoughts.  I'd seriously much rather meet an alien species that has accepted atheism. Much less crazy."
aliens,3dfdtb,VigilantNarcoleptic,2,Wed Jul 15 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd like to think that if a species got far enough to develop interstellar travel, that their scientific discoveries gave them the true answers long ago. Id like to think that as a species, they evolved past religions collectively. But then again, I'd also like to think that humanity will grow out of it some day soon, but we all know that's not happening."
aliens,3dfdtb,Dibblerius,2,Wed Jul 15 23:29:20 2015 UTC,You think technology level to do interstellar travel would give all the true answers? Why? Why would you think that?
aliens,3dfdtb,VigilantNarcoleptic,3,Thu Jul 16 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he'll have an answer, but I think that's an interesting question, and I side with the idea that science (and technology) will answer all the reasonable questions, and will give parameters in which subjective questions can be argued over.  For instance, it was once thought (by Hippocrates) that hysteria was caused by the movement of the uterus around inside the body, due to drying out and lacking bodily fluids. For a while, people didn't realize the brain was important in thinking about things. It may seem like these are questions unrelated to religious thought, true answers, or philosophy but knowing what body parts do, and why they happen tells us a lot about ourselves. What harms us, what kills us and what heals us. Why is this important? It puts things in perspective.   For thousands of years, rather civilized people, ignored the blatant fact that we look an awful lot like apes. No, said others, we are made in the image of God. Even after we're all civilized with starched shirts, they have to argue about this in Court. To this day, there are people who still insist it's not true, even with the genetic evidence, and the few hundreds of thousand of years in which bipedal apes (us and other species) jockeyed for position.  The point is perspective matters. If you know why you exist, what came before you, in what ways you're still like that animal. In what ways your instinctual nature plays out in a civilized society. You know yourself better. This perspective grows, as you learn about the solar system, how you are part of one planet, in one solar system, in a huge galaxy, in an even larger Universe, and it spread out, ever expanding, and the distances between even yourself and the next star is huge.   Mix into that, how unfair and cruel Nature can be. You may struggle with the idea that we're anything but animals in a huge cosmos.  Now, to the point of why interstellar travel would answer most other questions is simply that if one is able to travel the vast distances between even the nearest star to Earth, it would require an unimaginable amount of knowledge in the workings of the Universe. What is actually going on with quarks. What is the basic nature of all energy (matter is very slow energy).   I have accepted that we're made of matter. Our body is matter. Our brain is matter (lumping energy and matter together). And the Universe as far as anyone can tell doesn't differentiate between the matter that makes up poop, and the matter that makes up your brain. Your brain is certainly doing a lot more than shit, but it's not a magic special snowflake. It's just more matter, much better organized matter. I guess, the point is, if they can know enough to travel the vast distances, than any idea of an ephemeral nature that your brain is somehow specially connected to a soul, and somehow the Universe knows you're different than a dog, unless maybe a dog gets the same treatment... Just if you WANT to believe that you're more than matter, you have to believe there is something else connecting with your thoughts. It has to be visible (not visible by eyes but by equipment). We emit heat, and we can reflect an absorb light. If there is some other form of energy (an exchange of information happening), you'd find it, as you're taking apart the Universe to understand it, to use it, to be able to bend it to travel, you'll know if there is more going on with the human body (or their body) than what we know today.  I believe we're animals, and that we die, and life isn't a straight line that terminates, but a circle, we don't exist, we exist, and we wind up right back at the start (not existing). Sing the Lion King Song with me, it's the Ciiiiircle of Liiiiife...  Now, I said I think science and technology will answer most reasonable questions. I should highlight reasonable. You can formulate a question which the answer is totally subjective, however the parameters of the question are aided by science.  An fMRI can look at a person thinking about something, and with testing, can know when a person is thinking about vanilla ice-cream. Implant an electrode in the brain, and you can stimulate the brain to feel certain ways. We have drugs that can make you happy, or suicidal, and sometimes it's the same drug! So, you're hemming in the brain currently with science. You know you can make the brain do things, and you can predict or know what the brain is thinking in very limited ways. If you want, you can damage the brain to make a person more aggressive. When do you stop being you? I think that's a question which may or may not have a true answer. I bet a sufficiently technologically advanced society in which robots are doing all the work, people just sit around bitchin' and moaning' and arguing about the nature of self. It's probably horribly boring. All the fun people are playing Frisbee golf.  Ah, and as to God, at some point, you either do or don't find evidence, but honestly, I don't care. If it exists, it hasn't done shit for us. Then it's just some cosmic voyeur watching asteroids obliterate planets."
aliens,3dfdtb,Dibblerius,2,Thu Jul 16 04:08:25 2015 UTC,"Holy cow! That is a long and dedicated answer! Awesome!   Thank you for spending all that time on my question :)   I don't have a particular interest in a God or not a God.  In fact to me it is as simple as if anything supernatural is found to exist it per definition turns into being natural. So there is no difference between gods or just unimaginably mighty or influential beings, no matter beyond what different laws of physics even if they make the laws them selves, are none!     My line of thinking is more about science and intelligence it self and of the depth of the cosmos complexity and variety.  I suggest that for every answer it has given us it has always presented many more questions. I see no reason why we should assume one would reach the bottom of this lake before the other if it even has a bottom.   Intelligence the way we know and can imagine it, biological or artificial, no matter how infinite in power are based and bound in a physics of four dimensions, on a scale of processes above electrons, and within laws familiar to us and depends itself on this predictability.   So does logic reason in it self! It is a pattern of predictability in its own laws of physics.   Is the cosmos and its truths or the limit of the ultimate intelligence the deeper lake? I have no idea!   I can't help but wonder though if some time in the far future something that was once human, a descendant of you perhaps, will look out the window of an interstellar star-cruiser and say:  ""I imagine something with advanced enough technology to travel to other multiverses would know the truth"""

aliens,3dfdtb,zeuph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:56:14 2015 UTC,"I meant in regards to religion. I feel like if a species gets that far along, they'll collectively realize along the way that evolution and things like that are undeniable. When they start exploring other worlds and realize that life starts a million different ways it kinda becomes evident that there's no space ghost up there just creating life sometimes."

But whatever.   Anyway, if you wanna talk realistically, NOBODY would have said that in earlier times, as you mentioned. Simply because everyone believed in their various religions and wouldn't dare entertain the idea that maybe they werent necessarily true.   There are more non-believers these days then there have ever been and the cause of that is being contributed to education and advances and discoveries in science. Religion is slowly dying, but it IS happening."

However, I believe that this is just a cover if there's ETs here. Then they would be cool with it if they arrived.  Also, as you say. Religion wont die easily. Not because there's many believers, just that people are gullible. Not gullible in a sense that they believe in a man walking on water. Just that if there's someone preaching something and some people listen to then people will adapt that as a norm. Just as people accept other parts of our society, they accept religion as well.  I think more people will react in a ""No alien gun' walk on my lawn!""-way than ""oh no, my god is dis proven""-kind of way."

aliens,3dfdtb,Tremendousdread,0,Thu Jul 16 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this... you know they'd probably need a civilian corps of people that just interact as like a mini-state department to control the flow of information and diplomacy between the two sides. They'd probably pull from the State Department and the Department of Defense. However, in my imagination, the aliens set up testing zones, and you go take a test (kind of like the Foreign Service Exam for the State Department jobs) and if you pass, you end up on the task force... Whatever, it's a cool idea. I gotta dream.  The more I think about it, it would be government employees that have done similar work that would end up working on it. Like people who are good at learning languages, learning cultural differences, and understand how diplomacy works."

I think almost everyone now a days suspects and are open minded to the possibility. Many others straight out  believe with conviction in their existence. In other words I think at first people might be a bit surprised and you might expect some people going crazy but that's the nature of people.  But I think the majority of the world after the initial shock settles, would say they always knew it all along and are not surprised. Things would calm down and pretty much go back to normal to a certain extent."

We don't have space travel down to the point of getting somewhere fast, or easily.. And this thing just shows up on earth? Why? How advanced could this one single species be that just happened to show up on earth? That's why I say we should be in fear, and hopefully will help unite as a planet.

aliens,3dfdtb,Dibblerius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:14:12 2015 UTC,They could absolutely own us within weeks.

Humanoidish is cool, the elites from halo or star ship trooper versions and there would probably be bombs going off.  If they can communicate that's another big variable. If the military gets there first they would probably cover it up and capture or destroy them for the tech.   People would panic but most likely just stay home and watch in a daze.   There's just to many ways a tiny variable could go to change how we all would react"

aliens,3d7d23,Formaggio_svizzero,16,Thu Jul 16 04:43:16 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I get ""...not trashing on this subreddit""  Before more of us jump in, which seems like a very vague request for evidence, can I ask:   What's the extent of research, that you've done on your own? What counts as 'evidence' to you? At what point, will you be convinced? If ever?   See anyone of us can come up with a number of valid points; as open minded people, we assess this type of data constantly, checking for flaws while looking for glimmers of truth. None of it is concrete; those that have the good stuff have either lost it while having it tested by labs, or it's mysteriously disappears etc and the lowest of the low, when someone or 'agency' tries to pull a fast one on the community - which is getting somewhat easier to spot.  My issue is that many people who ask for proof, have done little to no research; be it contacting many of the organizations that are linked with abductees and encounters, reading some of the government FOIA redacted releases, following-up on the historical aspect in the form of books, documentaries and movies, so as to draw some conclusion - a basis for many of us on this forum to work with.  Personally, I take the subject matter seriously. I spend time sifting through data, meeting with researchers, contacting those I have difficulty meeting easily by email, or a phone call and attending discussions when they're held. This is the minimum I can do. Many of the people in the field are very warm and friendly; all are interested and in their own way, interested in their given field.   ""...It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but thanks anyway. :P""   You could dismiss all the information provided to you, as part of this question, and you're entitled to do so. It's not reflective of the deeper research that most in the field have done. It's up to you to do the research and ask us pertinent narrow questions about an incident or issue, as opposed to a wide question re 'evidence' which at best, will be a dilute answer.  I would direct your curiosity to follow-up on:  MUFON  Dr. Roger Leir  Dr. John Mack  Wilburt Smith  Linda Moulton Howe  Grant Cameron - Presidential UFO - Loads of FOIA references.  These are just a few of the many research material that's available. It'll help you approach what for you, might qualify as evidence. Hope this helps."

aliens,3d7d23,Dysnomi,5,Wed Jul 15 02:53:31 2015 UTC,"I could post a lot of stuff that I PERSONALLY believe to be real evidence, but you'll always get people that don't believe that evidence to be real.

You also might look at the some of the literature on alien abductions. John Mack and Bud Hopkins are two primary authors, also Dabid Jacobs. John Mack (now dead) I know has a lot of talks on youtube; the others may as well. For some real standout abductions incidents look into the case of Travis Walton as well as the one involving Betty and Barney. Tons of information on the net about those two.   If ET's and paranormal phenomena generally are something you want to start getting educated on, I really strongly recommend the radio show www.theparacast.com. The two hosts are amazingly knowledgeable, and not easily fooled by bullshit.   I'd say also do a google search or a youtube search on the Rendesham Forest UFO incident.

Our time on earth is just a small fraction of its 4.5 billion years of existence, and an even smaller fraction of the universes 13.8 billion years.

I'm talking about a HUGE spaceship on top of my neighbor's house (one floor house so it wasn't that high up, I could REALLY see it).  It was amazing. It was so many years ago but I still hold a mental picture of it. It was dark, nowhere near round, it was more rectangular, it had weird wings, also in rectangular shapes and it was black with some lines of dark red all around it. It was so weird. I wish smartphones had existed back then.  After being in awe with my mom for all the time that the ship was there it started moving slowly, hovering all the time till the house in the other direction covered it, it was like 3 floors high.

As you're aware, most scientists in relevant fields agree that alien life is out there, somewhere. But most of these same people view abductee claimers as crackpots.  So to just prove that aliens don't exist would be going against science. Yet to prove that aliens are here, visiting and abducting us is another matter entirely."

Evolution for us here on earth is oxygen based (duh), however the same evolutionary processes that led us to where we are could be totally different on other planets. For example, life on some other planet could have been forged with methane, or some other type of gas. There can be completely different models of evolution on a planet based of that planets specific chemistry. We just haven't found it yet. I find that the most interesting part of evolution, is that the processes of natural selection can happen anywhere in the universe. Where that life takes place, the biology and chemistry can or will be unique to that planet."

aliens,3d0cdd,mrgdh,5,Sun Jul 12 13:58:57 2015 UTC,"Yup this is exactly what ghosts and spirits are.  They don't exist In the physical plane.  They exist in the Astral plane or higher places than that.its not as ""dense"" over there so you can fly and have any item you can think of, as well as make yourself present in the physical world.there are probably some  alien races living there, but I think most exist in the physical world. Really the only thing stopping you from entering the Astral plane is the frequency your giving out.you can practice meditation and Astral projection to raise your frequency to a level that allows your consciousness to leave your physical body. You can't stay there now because you are attached to your human container, but you can have some experiences and talk to the different races inhabiting it."

aliens,3d0cdd,johnnywalkah,2,Mon Jul 13 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"When your talking spirituality, there is no shortcuts to anything.  I'd start with googling astral projection there is even wiki guides on simple versions of it.  Lucid dreaming is the same concept but usually happens as you become aware in a dream.  Astral projecting is being fully conscious while your body goes to sleep.  It takes time to practice and I doubt you will master it as soon as you start.  There are times when you can accidently find yourself in the astral realm tho, likewhen your in a dream.  You may have sometimes felt a falling sensation right before you fall into a deep sleep and it jolts you awake instantly, well thats sorta what it feels like as your consiocness leaves your body.  Id start with simple google searches."

aliens,3d0cdd,ChillingSensations,3,Sun Jul 12 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"The ""Hunch"" that you are experiencing is an extremely profound realization OP.  I think you should check out the Law of One.  It's a channeled message from a cosmic intelligence so most people won't go anywhere near it, but since you are clearly interested in this phenomenon of light and frequencies and how it affects the reality we perceive and you came to r/aliens to ask, its worth a shot.  There is a sub dedicated to it that has a link to Scott Mandelker who explains the message in more or less layman's terms on youtube.  I can also link you to loads of other sources that discuss what you are talking about but this was the starting point for me.   EDIT:  After rereading your post OP it made me realize that if this isn't your cup of tea there is this guy, David Sereda, who basically dedicated his life to answering the exact question you are asking using physics and science.  Perhaps this could be a better starting point.  He is all over youtube as well."
aliens,3d0cdd,DirtyBird9889,6,Thu Jul 16 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"It would explain why some animals (especially dogs) can see ghosts.  That being said, I have no idea whether it's plausible or not."

IR and night vision cameras can give us imagery just outside the visible spectrum and we use plenty of equipment that is sensitive to radiation frequencies beyond that ranging from mobile phones to x-ray machines and that's just common objects, radio telescopes are far more sensitive to those ranges. I think if there were beings all around us that existed as pure energy within the known spectrum we would have detected them by now.  The idea of beings existing on Earth that we can't perceive has been around for a while, the issue is that we can never really answer that question. No matter how far our understanding and technology progresses we can never be sure that there isn't something more"
aliens,3d0cdd,goindrains,2,Sun Jul 12 16:21:33 2015 UTC,So the aliens are cloaking or not made out of the same matter we are but they uncloak or become normal matter at the times we see them... or why aren't they reflecting the light we can see like every other animal do?   What exactly are you suggesting here? I'm not sure I get it.   If they are not made out of matter like we are we will or would never had ever seen or interact with them until we find ways to detect those other things like dark matter I would assume.

No one understands the intellect and science that these beings use, therefore we try not to rustle their jimmies.   We do however have an advantage on the physical realm. I believe Aliens are trying to break into the physical realm and learn more about how we interact with the world around us.

Of course many things can get in touch with us via other senses outside the usual 5, aswell as machines/animals may have a different spectrum which explains part of this thing.  Also add the dimensional differences, since there are various dimensions, we can't see what's in the others unless we make some kind of vibrational rise.   In the end there is all the frequency of our planet and of our body, which connects us with close-to-our-frequency stuff."

aliens,3d05r3,Throalien,5,Sun Jul 12 10:59:43 2015 UTC,For a start memories cannot remain unaltered. Each time you remember something your remembering the details you could recall the last time you thought of it. Basically each time your remember something your remembering that last memory not the event itself.   As for your story other than asking other people you were around at that time if they remember this Nadège I doubt anyone here can help you.
aliens,3d05r3,ArdRi_,2,Sun Jul 12 14:59:20 2015 UTC,"So you never had Nadège over to play at your house?  How are you with knowledge today?  Not sure what part this friend played in your knowledge pool, but my guess is you have the ability to sense anomalies as a reflex.  Sometimes people seem knowledgeable but in reality, they just have the formula, not answers. I can explain more..  By knowing something about (A) and knowing very little about (B), you can still come up with answer for A+B=C. You simply deduced the answer is C."
aliens,3d05r3,velezaraptor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"Nadège always told me she was sick, and that her parents wouldn't let her go outside, or come at my house because she was frail. The question about my knowledge today is quite special. I know more than most people on a lot of topics, but I'm average academically, I'm a slacker but I get by, like most people I imagine. Also, my mom was an alcoholic and a depressive and my father just plain absent. My mother made herself puke in the sink before coming to get me to school but most of the times, she was too drunk and just passed out on the couch, and I would get back home walking when I realized she wouldn't come. My parents wouldn't let me have someone over for those reasons.   The thing is, when I was with Nadège it was different, have you ever been hypnotized? When I was with Nadège, it was like I was in a trans-like state. Something I didn't mention too, is that the teacher that was mean with me when I was very young also thought I was autistic because I would do or say odd things in particularly in the courtyard at recess. Things that would freak her out, but I don't remember much about it at all.   Nadège gave me a fascination for everything space-related, planets, astronomy but also nature. She made me want to become an astronaut, I guess a lot of kids want to become astronauts anyway, it probably means nothing. I'm just trying to give all the details I can remember.  Also, you're dead on the money with the infering formula. Being able to formulate conclusions from incomplete context is my ultimate talent. But, the knowledge was pretty specific, I remember we were digging in the ground, catching flies, scarabs, but I couldn't have guessed the name of all the insects there on my own, like I did then, I had never seen them before and that's why I told her ""I didn't know"", I felt so strange being able to name these. But something that could explain it would be that I might have watched a documentary and just remembered it from there. There definitely are more logical explanations, but I don't remember them."
aliens,3d05r3,velezaraptor,2,Tue Jul 14 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked about her coming over is: How can your mom speak about her like she never existed if she never came over? Did you ever get a school picture of her? Maybe you can dig up records of the school you went to, ensuring she existed and was registered there.  I can tell you every person I've met makes me feel differently, in a profound way. Some people make me creative, some people turn off that creative switch I have, some make me sad without doing anything. Some, right away I can tell they're disturbed. I get it when you say she made you feel motivated to explore the universe. If you can feel through people, almost vicariously, you're not alone.  I was recently researching how memories are kept in our head on accident, I was researching sleep patterns. What I learned was interesting about the four stages.  1) eyes closed, light sleep. Can be easily roused.  2) deeper sleep. Still light, but more difficult to awaken.  3) deep sleep. Body repairs damage to tissues.  4) REM sleep. Dreams happen, events of the day are ""saved"" to long-term memory.  During stage 4, the ability to efficiently ""save"" information we've heard, seen, or otherwise exposed to and how important or arbitrary it is could speak to being autistic or having autistic tendencies. Remembering random facts really boils down to many, many brain synapses you're able to recall efficiently.   Side note:  Dysfunctional parents are always responsible for emotional growth. Try to understand human nature and learn, teach, and overcome this by doing research and help yourself more than a kid who let this affect their success in life. And my guess is, you don't really have to try at life, it just comes to you, embrace it."

aliens,3czam1,Thjiiikkmmmmkkllllll,5,Sun Jul 12 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"No. The media is misleading and fails to take in account the differences between technological and mental advances, as a function of spiritual growth.  One of the closest the media representation of an alien race, was an adaptation of Frank Stranges' 1951 ""Stranger at the Pentagon"" into the movie ""The Day The World Stood Still."" Considering that the media is essentially a propaganda tool, this was one film that came closest to hitting the mark, followed by ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" which had loads of support by various government agencies, not to mention a tongue-in-cheek remark by President Reagan, as noted by Steven Spielberg.  While working with abductees, there is a line where they're serious and on the ball, then there are moments when they're relaxed. We place a lot of emphasis on technology, and they understand this about us; they have families like we do and have an understanding of a soul's journey to learn and grow. There are amusing moments with long-term abductees - small jokes, as the aliens reflect on some aspects of an exercise. They do laugh and relax; they do play jokes at times.  Betty and Barney Hill had some amusing moments; while speaking with Betty, the alien team that was reviewing Barney on a medical table were shocked to see his teeth fall out. The doctor on board didn't understand why Barney was wearing false teeth. After Betty explained the health reason behind the dentures, the doctor asked her ""Why doesn't he just grow the teeth back?"" Humans with dentures and amputated body parts were some of the earliest encounters on abduction, including loss of vision, the need for glasses, hearing aid and toupee. Many species couldn't understand the basis for not fixing these health issues. As they prompted their human abductee for an answer, there was a lot of laughing and amusement. Gastric flatulence was another aspect of abductions, that was both amusing to abductees and abductors.  Clothes were another aspect on abductions. Many alien species didn't understand our fascination with jewelry, shoes and an attire that's uncomfortable. After an abduction, they had problems fitting the person to their clothes and many times, just did their best. They did leave mental notes for some that a piercing was infected, or not to wear certain constraints over the abdomen, as it interfered with digestion etc. In part they were amused with our medical progress and fashion, as their process continued.     STS-75 would be one aspect of us, that they'd have to laugh at the most; if there was a 'Funny Story From Earth' section for aliens, I think this made it in. If you're aware of the background of the 'tether' - the aliens response after it was cut from the Shuttle, after it caused extensive damage, was their way of wondering about us and if we'd thought the experiment through."

Sift through all the alien stuff, read the books and listen to the interviews of big name (possibly shill) theorists, poke all the things that talk about Iran saying the US is run by ""tall, white aliens"" and how Russia is acting all uppity again because they have new backers, former government employees and retired military dropping super weird (truth?) bombs, etc.  You come out the other side thinking there's three, four, maybe five species that have been hanging around Earth for a really long time and they're all dicks.

aliens,3czam1,billybobjoe3,3,Sun Jul 12 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"My honest answer is I have absolutely no idea and the question fascinates me incredibly and is something I wonder about all the time.  I do notice however that movies and tv shows often tend to just make them out to be 'creatures' or 'monsters'  flying around in advanced flying machines yet when outside, reduced to naked wild animals that growl snarl or sneak around and don't seem to use any other tech. Signs, Area 51, Dark skies etc. Often they are more used as a trope ""scary thing"" in horror movies. Still at least in the Aliens movies the creatures while Alien, are meant to be animals rather than intelligent sentient beings.   I can't think of a movie that really deals with and explores what it might be like to actually interact an 'Alien' intelligence apart from the likes of 2001. But I'd like to see something that goes into it in more detail in a similar fashion to how there is a recent surge in movies that deal with what it might be like to interact with an Artificial Intelligence."

It was an overcrowded house, all 4 kids lived down there at one time or another. Every single one of us would get sleep paralysis and see a dark figure between the hours of 0200-0400.

It was in a room,overlooking a city center, reflecting the street lamps something like the lights of Tokyo. I remember the wooden mahogany walls with sexy mantis looking women in shimmering turquoise and green plastered daintily on it. The entirety of the room had a quiet yet subtle noisiness to it for they were all communicating telepathically. Then this humanoid looking woman who seemed to be the one in charge, with a big waist approached me and extracted some of my sperm via my belly button. It was a surreal, weird experience and it felt as real as I'm typing this.

We absorb so much info and stimulus during the day and we can't process it all at once. Dreams are like the minds release valve. If you're constantly talking and thinking about aliens and ufos and weird dreams; it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.   Positive side: - obviously you're special with a purpose. Fucking man up and do your mission already. What are you waiting for?"

aliens,3coysr,clintbeastwood-,2,Sat Jul 11 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"I myself have always been a lucid dreamer, and have always felt this indescribable internal link to extraterrestrials.  Having said that, I can recall a specific ""dream"" that I experienced during middle school, around 6th or 7th grade (1998ish). My parents had just divorced a year earlier, and my sister and I chose to live with our father, being forced to move from southeastern Ohio to northeastern Kentucky, into an old farmhouse with my grandmother.  My father and I shared one large open bedroom in the finished attic.  The attic itself was a long, rectangular shape, with two small windows on either gabled end.  My bed was directly in front one of these windows. I must first explain that a normal summer night in this area is lacking almost any man-made light.  All moonlight, just as I like it.  Point being, it's usually really, really dark at night.  I awoke one night to find my bedroom filled with light, as if the sun were right outside my window.  I closed my eyes, then slowly opened them, allowing them to adjust to the intensity of their light.  I rolled out of bed, stood up, and turned to face the window.  In awe, I witnessed a gun metal grey disc, hovering almost silently just a few yards outside the window. That's where my ""dream"" recollection stops.  I never really mentioned it to anyone, for obvious reasons, but I did tell my dad about it some years later.  I was working with him, doing some maintenance work at a local grocery store, and while on lunch break one day, I decided to share my dream.  My dad sat silently, eating a Swiss cake roll, eyes intently focused on me.  After I finished my story, he paused, grinned, and spoke ""Son, that wasn't a dream.  I remember that night.  That was as real as you and I sitting here right now.  You don't remember anything else?"" I didn't.  Which I'm sort of thankful for, but am also very curious as to what he may recall.  He never would tell me, other than that he and I are different; that we have been visited many times, and will continue to be visited throughout our time here on Earth."

aliens,3cnz7q,zeuph,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:10:08 2015 UTC,"I like the show--it's entertaining, but it should be stressed that MUFON has little production and directorial input on the show. They have lent their name to History Channel and it's History Channel's show. That said, History Channel is in the business of entertainment, not hard scientific inquiry.   The show's case files are based on real MUFON case files and sometimes they get it right and sometimes they present things that sacrifice integrity for entertainment value. One in particular that I can think of off the bat is the USOs episode where they mention the ""secret underwater base in Malibu"" that has been proven to be just a rock formation.   Many of the MUFON members involved with the show express frustration with it in private--especially with some of the more popular cast members, some of whom are actors and not real ufologists or researchers (D. Equitz for instance).   That said, it's an entertaining show and I enjoy watching it and playing the drinking game with it and ancient aliens. The rule is anytime they ask you a rhetorical question, drink!   ""Is it possible?"" ""Could it be?"" ""The question has to be asked,"" haha"

I mean, if wouldn't last forever, there'd be minimal death (for an apocalypse). We'd still have analog technology and diesel.   We'd have a rough 6-months to a year and then we'd reorganize our society again. Most people would plant gardens and grow food. People would have a lot more free time due to the Internet and television being gone so there would probably be a big explosion of learning, reading and discovery.   I predict that the reemergence of the close-knit community would occur. We'd all know our neighbors. Most of us would have tight-knit extended family groups.

aliens,3chn7y,mulderc,-2,Thu Jul 9 08:07:20 2015 UTC,It would still be getting direct light from other stars so you can't eliminate reflections entirely. I don't know what could collect/reflect light in that manner but it's still not impossible.

aliens,3cedug,NothingIfAnything,11,Tue Jul 7 06:52:33 2015 UTC,"This gave me chills. Story time!  In September of 2007 I witnessed a craft very similar to this if not identical. I saw it floating near Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, Ca.  I was getting out of class from the local community college while I was talking on my cell with a friend of mine about what we were going to do for her birthday when I started to hear a lot of interference over the line.    I had a weird feeling and looked north towards the hills by camp Pendleton when I saw a large black 3 dimensional rectangle with what appeared to be writing on it.  At first I thought it was some sort of blimp but it was perfectly stationary.    I was probably 4 miles from it and it looked massive as it was hovering over a few houses in the distance.  I hung up the call because of the static and tried to snap a few pictures on my old moto razr but the object couldn't be made out.  I called her back and I told her what I was seeing and she told me to call one of our buddies that lived closer to the base that could probably get a better look.  Right as I hung up, I heard the sound of jets coming from behind me.    I looked back and saw two f-18s flying towards it from the southeast at a pretty low elevation.  I looked back to where the object had been and it was gone.   The planes made it to the location where the object had been and circled the general vicinity for maybe two or three minutes and then headed east at a pretty fast velocity.  I was just dumbstruck and couldn't believe what I had seen.    It was that event that made me a solid believer that UFOs are not man-made objects.   Over the years I did witness strange lights near the base from time to time and I knew a few marines that were stationed there throughout the years.  Most told me that they had seen lights and strange stuff fly near the base pulling maneuvers that could not have been performed by our military aircraft.  The few that hadn't witnessed anything firsthand knew someone who had.  Pretty crazy stuff!"

Just as I had done so I saw a huge black cube fly over the house going only maybe 15 mph. It wasn't completely flat. It kinda looked like the Borg from Star Trek actually.... Anyway I yelled for my dad to come see it. He holds a security clearance but obviously can't ever talk about it. They live in Middletown De. I watched it fly for about 2 minutes while it just kept moving south east towards Smyrna. It was probably the strangest thing I ever seen and that's counting two other UFOs.

The incident with the Iraqi army that scrambled a jet and the jet became dysfunctional, this was recorded by 2 radars and confirms both the jet and the unidentified object. There's a video called ""top 10 UFO cases"" or something. I thought it would be shit but it actually had some of the best cases.   Also, when you cross this border of belief in UFOs. It's not a frog leap to start pondering about who would be flying these ships. Whatever it is it had to be manufactured, right? If this is what you're leaning on then a whole new topic opens up and granted that it is much more scares when we're talking credible evidence. However one thing that is compelling is the abduction cases. Hold on now, I can hear you say ""pfff, that's just a bunch of lunatics"" but it's a incredible re-occurrence of stories, details and some people claim they've had 'sessions' with military personnel and 'famous people'. David Jacobs have 40 years of experience with regression with people who claim to be abductees. If you're doing something for 40 years it's pretty safe to say that you've got some clue as to what this is about. It's either that something is going on with these people or they're all suffering from the same type of ""dysfunction"" that's creating these hallucinations or fabrications. Either case this would be interesting to either the field of ufology, field of psychology and/or field of healthcare wouldn't it?  Abductees often talk about their life being very miserable, that all they want is support whilst they're going through this. If they absolutely believe what's happening is true then being impregnated with a child to later be removed by these horrible beings are pretty traumatizing, wouldn't you say? On top of that there's no kind of support for this kind of psychological trauma - other than going through regression which mean you have to go through this over.. and over.. and over again."

To make up evidence of ET's rather than deny it!   They are constantly pressured to motivate why they should be funded and to demonstrate what useful things they find.   People who work at NASA (something they share with employees at SETI) are like us who browse alien and space forums and what not, passionate visionaries who work their hardest to broaden mankind's horizon with the same relentless pursuit of knowledge!, with the only difference being that they are better educated, smarter and even more driven!

Another reason is for the advancement of life on Earth, technologically, spiritually, etc. Although I'm positive if we do see any type of disclosure it won't bring about these types of events because of what you said; it would be a shame for us sheeple to be on level ground with the government leaders."

Then you'll have an eventual outflow of the abduction reports and finally military tests,  because publicly announcing that would make governments look bad for not ""retaliating"" or ""handling"" it way earlier. Of course this is speculative, but I see the harmless information being brought up frst, if at all.  We could just see acknowledgement of UFO's but no talk of actual beings :/"

None of me believes at all, at best I would say some things are not currently explainable but that doesn't mean aliens are visiting our planet. What I think keeps me coming back is I find the stories fun and if solid evidence ever came out it would be a huge historic event.

This sub's sidebar specifically states its purpose, which at no point includes burden of proof.  It does however fundamentally require the absolute acceptance of ET existence as fact.    When you know, you don't need more proof than that knowledge.  When you've experienced something, you know it's true."
aliens,3c7335,butteryoatmeal,3,Sun Jul 5 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"I think ""knowing,"" as you're using it here, and proof are two slightly different things.  People see a flashing light from a radio tower through thick smoke and ""know"" they saw a UFO, but they don't have proof. Similar experiences can be said about seeing ghosts and the like. Humans can experience a lot of different things and come to believe them as genuine experiences. I've known people who think lens flares from the sun are angels in their pictures.  Humans are emotional creatures and prone to having deeply effecting experiences, but that doesn't make them genuine in an objective sense. That's why I care about proof and not just ""knowing.""  You're right that this sub doesn't demand burden of proof, and I don't think this subject is something that can be summed up with just a picture or a video. But if we don't ask for people to provide evidence of their claims, what is the point of hearing their story? There is nothing to stop any of them from just bullshitting and writing a wall of fiction.  I think that if the sub made people who make claims to back them up, then at least we could start building a database of evidence to review and see if there really is anything to these alien theories. Otherwise, isn't it all just a circlejerk?"
aliens,3c7335,ImJustSadSorry,0,Mon Jul 6 03:16:59 2015 UTC,"That depends on why you're here.  If what you're seeking isn't expressed in the manifesto there on the sidebar then you're probably in the wrong place.    Mufon and other such sites are probably more databases for such reports and evidence.  This sub is really for like-minded believers and experiencers to share their ideas and discuss events.  If you think you're going to get photo evidence -- or any evidence, for that matter -- for these things, you're sadly mistaken.  That's neither fair nor realistic.  I've seen what I absolutely know to be UFOs as well as other things that appear to be UFOs but may not be on several occasions in my life.  I do not, however, have photo equipment.  At least I speak for myself when I say that I'm quite content to see what I see without asking confirmation from others, nor should their be any burden of proof on me to provide such.  I can describe those things to people and will happily do so.  I like discussing them with other experiencers. The same goes for other paranormal occurrences.  What I don't like -- and what is not in keeping with the sidebar statement -- is when ""skeptics""/""debunkers"" come through with zero experience of their own and start demanding proof.  And this is where ""I know what I know"" is well within keeping of the sidebar statement, which is the express purpose of this sub.  Every sub has it.  If that doesn't match what you want from it, you must see what needs to happen.  Yes, find another sub.  There are others.  Your wishes for what you want this to be are not especially relevant."

aliens,3c63am,big-booty-latina,2,Sun Jul 5 04:29:19 2015 UTC,I saw 5 UFOs last night that were orange/red dots in the sky moving in a line. (Weren't fireworks or planes). I watched them move across the sky for about 30 seconds. I looked away for maybe 5 seconds and looked back and they were gone. It was far away so I don't know what it was but it could've been an alien ship. Idk

aliens,3c63am,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:05:42 2015 UTC,"Section 5. Virtual Safety Car (VSC) of article  Safety car:       Following an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury, the FIA established an Accident Panel to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimize the risk of a crash during circumstances akin to those of the aforementioned accident that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags.  The Panel recommended the implementation of a ""Virtual Safety Car"", based on the system used in Le Mans racing ""slow zone"". On top of not being allowed to overtake under yellow flag conditions in the affected sector, a ""VSC"" icon would appear trackside and on the driver's steering display, obliging drivers to not exceed the posted speed limit thus resulting in a 35% speed reduction.  The VSC was tested over the course of the final three races of the 2014 Formula One season, during parts of free practice sessions.   The system was evolved taking into account drivers' feedback and was officially introduced for the 2015 season following ratification by the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC).  The VSC was officially used for the first time — and for a brief period prior to the deployment of the actual safety car — at the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, in consequence of a crash by rookie Max Verstappen. The system saw its first extended deployment at the 2015 British Grand Prix after Carlos Sainz, Jr's power unit failed on the final turn of the Silverstone Circuit.

If you have any other claims to support this video to be not fake then you should've supplied that.  The whole video is arguing against itself, sadly. Which makes this a probable fake.

Or humanity crumbles under the boot of the elite corporations who run the planet.    You need to read everything here as it is fiction and do as much research as you can on the subject matter. Along with natural law, math and frankly anything you can get your hands on. The rabbit hole does run deep so even if we ourselves don't get contact, we'll at least have knowledge   You'll see a LOT of people talk about ""Disclosure"" like we're going to have some day where we'll be told all the true going ons of our world. But that will not happen as we currently live under a system of slavery. We need to abolish slavery on our own before we can even consider any kind of wide scale contract/disclosure. Be careful who you trust because its VERY easy to be manipulated  Not like they can just pop up. say ""AYY LMAO BE GOOD HUMANS"" And everything will be chill. World would immediately go into chaos and we would lose the illusion of order we have. Even as someone who wants disclosure this route this is not wise. At least not yet.

I feel we are already living on the brink of a major paradigm shift in global society, it just needs a little push to start the ball rolling. The transition will probably not go very smooth though, so expect a lot of casualties. Some scenarios talk about 90%+ of the population on earth that will die during this transition, I personally am much more optimistic and think 80-90% will survive but the doom scenarios are certainly possible.   Belief is the enemy of knowing.   I don't see it like that. Blind belief is the enemy of knowing, or dogma. People who are unwilling to question their own beliefs or to put them to the test, that to me is an unhealthy attitude. But not believing in itself, as the best ideas and knowledge often comes from the intuitive belief that something is or behaves a certain way. Knowledge is the child of the imagination."

aliens,3bzq0y,coldethel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"I agree mostly with the other poster. However I believe something will happen to our world. A big change. I know this is pretty well discussed and most people puke by the thought of it but I believe that something will happen.   Maybe a disclosure will happen and unless Stephen bassett successfully form a congressional hearing on this subject I don't believe a formal disclosure will happen. A major mass sighting or something along those lines might force official people to talk about this subject. Other than that I believe that in our lifetime the earth will be so destroyed by our way of treating it badly that some parts might be unhabitable. However this is merely my speculations and opinions.  I'm just saying this to provide to you information that even if you do an immense research on the subject, you can conclude different things and this is vital for all of us. When/If something happen the more people who researched the subject the better. I started when I was 17 and I have traveled to many places around the world. I lived in Tokyo for 15 months and I had a very fun time and made a lot of friends. You have plenty of time to experience this world and my tip would be to not sit around and wait for something to happen. Research thoroughly the things you want to do and then head out on your adventure.  Also like the other poster said that they will probably not just show up and be like ""hey buddy we're here to save you out of the gutter"". I believe that if they show up it wont be because some guy really wanna ride a spaceship. It would probably be on the verge of destroying the whole planet and it would probably be some kind of evacuation.  If you're interested in a formal disclosure I think you should look up Stephen Bassett. If you're interested in the abduction phenomena and how it correlates to some kind of evacuation-plan then I believe David Jacobs or Dr Karla Turner(unfortunately she's diseased) could explain a few things. If you want to know research behind the whole subject with the truth being kept from us then most modern popular ufologist then my favorites are Richard Dolan or Stanton Friedman would be of good service. There's plenty of lectures and documentaries with these figures.  Good luck!"

aliens,3bpgfo,Sisko-ire,2,Wed Jul 1 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"So why was everyone laughing? Is his evidence so good that it's hysterical to believe it's real? What's gonna happen when someone takes a video of a real alien (assuming aliens are real) one day where the alien looks dead in the camera and says ""Hello. I'm an alien. And this is really happening."" Will the most perfect evidence still be doubted and laughed at? I only wonder"
aliens,3bpgfo,Cycle21,3,Thu Jul 2 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"Because of the imagery. Its a comedy show, the idea of aliens traveling across the galaxy, peeking in windows, or peeping around the corner in the kitchen like out of some children's book, is funny.  Everything about Stan screams con artist."
aliens,3bpgfo,Sisko-ire,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:04:30 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5viDOLV_0yc (3:02). I guess the tell-tale proof resides in his equations. They seem pretty stupid for hyper intelligent beings; allowing themselves to be recorded and needing to physically look though windows instead of using their drones to look though windows instead. One was just hanging in the kitchen preparing a snack? It seems like blinking puppets. Still pretty good post. I'll add it.
aliens,3bpgfo,zeuph,4,Wed Jul 1 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is hard to understand why they would do such things. Then again Stan Romanek's case is one of those with a lot of 'evidence'. They're constantly harrased by black helicopters and captured this on camera several times(this re-occured even as they moved). There's also these rings on their lawn when he ia taken. He keeps putting up cameras that catches these small orbs. Once he claims his house was targeted by a beam from a UFO and the day after he saw it removed the paint from his house. The same day workers show up and changes the panels only on the targeted area(he filmed this and said that they did not talk to him what so ever).  All of this happens when they have cameras all over the house, even outside. There's much more weird stuff, if all of these are hoax then I applaud him because this would take more time than a full time work.  People dismissed him when he got caught for child porn and refuses the accept that the person who made the claims was caught for tampering with evidence(planting evidence) and Stan were free to walk.   Stan is a weird figure to accept but there's not much to discredit him really. Even if many of these could be seen as hoaxes then others would be hard to explain."
aliens,3bpgfo,InfoExploration,2,Wed Jul 1 08:42:36 2015 UTC,I think that interview video where he threw a pen in the air and tried to play it off like it mysteriously fell on him was what did it for most people.  Fake 1 thing and everything else is highly questionable.
aliens,3bpgfo,zeuph,2,Wed Jul 1 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't fully agree, yes that interview is really weird and Stan is acting like a total fool. However, he has so much more information regarding this subject that a simple pentrick wouldn't discredit all of those pictures, videos and writings. For me to go against Stan's case then I would need a vast amount of debunking."
aliens,3bpgfo,InfoExploration,2,Wed Jul 1 18:25:49 2015 UTC,So why would he fake that pen thing?
aliens,3bpgfo,zeuph,2,Wed Jul 1 19:11:31 2015 UTC,I have no idea. I have not seen him being asked the question regarding this. However dismissing someone with hours of footage and an immense vast of evidence because he's flipping a pen and acting as if it's some mysterious happening does not 'debunk' other stuff made by him. Everyone fuck up once in a while.
aliens,3bpgfo,Sisko-ire,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:56:23 2015 UTC,I think your desire to believe is clouding your judgement on the guy. the pen thing is extremely telling of his type of personality.
aliens,3bpgfo,zeuph,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:15:57 2015 UTC,I neither believe nor disbelieve. He's not asking for my money. He's stating he's a vessel for 'them' to use to bring awareness to this world. That's worth listening too in my opinion. There's this constant witch hunt in this subject and I don't want people with credible evidence to be a subject to that.
aliens,3bpgfo,Sisko-ire,2,Thu Jul 2 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"Its not a witchhunt. Its people taking this 'seriously'. The problem with this subject is not people looking for truth. The problem is, its filled with con artists and liars taking advantage of people.  The subject is filled with people like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsw90DY5gEI  And that is the problem."
aliens,3bpgfo,zeuph,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:31:23 2015 UTC,"That's a pathological liar. Stan Romanek has hours and hours of footage, pictures and other types of evidence. Enough to not be dismissed as a ""crazy person"" or lunatic. He has an immense amount of witnesses and has testimony from doctors and psychologists to state that he is not showing any tendencies of being 'crazy' or lying. So he's spotless.. Until he flicks a pen and then becomes marked as a fraud. That's a witch hunt."
aliens,3bpgfo,Sisko-ire,2,Thu Jul 2 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't say he's spotless. The alien looking in the window thing is fuckin ridiculous , his entire personality screams BS artist. The pen flicking is just confirmation for people due to all the BS artist vibes he's been giving off. What kind of person behaves that way? Its not a witch hunt , people have different levels of perceptiveness and can pick up on dodgy behaviour earlier than others.  The girl in that video had so many people believing her until she was caught out finally. I can only imagine the types of people furiously defending her up until the last con had been exposed. I'm sure there are still people defending her now. Crying witch hunt etc."
aliens,3bpgfo,lobob123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the video doesn't show him throwing the pen in the air, his hand movements simply suggest it.

You can't discount all of his evidence based off of one questionable piece of evidence."

Also when my dad had a similar experience his was strange as well but he didn't hear voices.   One night he was laying down in bed looking up at his ceiling he closed his eyes as he took a big breathe and he noticed it was completely gone. He wasn't able to move but he was able to look around. He saw a light post right outside his ceiling since there was one next to the house. He then realized there was an owl on top of it staring at him while he was paralyzed. It stared at him for a good 10 seconds and within those seconds he wasn't able to breathe. When he finally was able to move and breathe again he saw that the ceiling was back. The first thing he thought was that it was a bad dream so he heads outside to see if there was an owl out there. Turns out that when he went out there he actually saw an owl on the light. (note that this was said by him and therefore I'm not making up any of it)   He lived in Mexico at the time and claimed to see a lot of ufos in the sky at the time. Going back to my experience, sometimes at night I'd feel like multiple beings are watching me. Should I be worried? Give me as much detail as possible, that would be very helpful."

We now know that UK/US special forces ambushed the Nazi's as they were escaping poland and possibly even captures the very best of the scientists germany had to offer.   If this were the case then it is entirely possible considering the outcome of project paperclip that the UK/US would keep these scientists and there research and build a shadow space agency working on anti-gravity and FTL drive (faster than lightspeed). Whilst the space race distracted the world with solid fuel rockets, the real interstellar/planetary space agency were working on these types of craft.

Also, on top of that, why does it seem like everyone is dismissing the chance of them having same type of varieties of personalities as us. That said, I think your statement is a tad vague. How could you know there's not a single abduction resulting in death? I mean, how would the dead man come back and tell the tale? If a person dies during a abduction, I cannot believe the aliens releasing some kind of press message about the ""accident"".  The truck incident would probably be one of those ""we just don't care"" cases. When we abduct animals for tagging, we don't take them and jump on their area they call home or where we took them. We take them, do our stuff and then let them back at the same spot. If we also knew they tried to cross the river before we abducted them, maybe we went to a little bit of trouble to let it out on the other side of the river. This does not mean we want any kind of affiliation with the animal. We simply spend little to no resources to help the animal to an great extent(from the animal perspective).  There's a absurd amount of details and information needed to even comprehend their possible agenda. It stretches as far as to say they're currently killing us off to that they wan't us as their adopted love-child. However, I would like to agree that they have a agenda because of their persistent presence. Trying to figure this out is the million-dollar-question."

aliens,3bh3dh,bli123z,4,Tue Jun 30 15:00:56 2015 UTC,"My only problem with this is that there's supposedly an alien race that looks just like us? Which ones of us? Are they white? Black? Asian? Do they have all of our races? That's completely impossible in terms of evolution.  Ok, then, the only explanation is that they are our ancestors - they came to Earth some time long ago and some of them stayed. Why did these ancient pilgrims completely destroy all their technology and records? If they were colonizing a new planet, why wouldn't they keep supply and trade routes open with the homeworld? Every situation I try to think up to explain these things makes no sense.  I want to believe, but there's no way they evolved to be exactly like us in a completely separate environment, and I can think of no explanation of them being our ancestors that accounts for our history having absolutely no record of them."
aliens,3bh3dh,AnabolicPanda,4,Tue Jun 30 00:44:35 2015 UTC,"What I took from it was, the ones who look like us share our genetics. The ones who are ""humanoid"" follow the same type of evolution. The helix form of genetics is the common manifestation of life in the universe. 1 + 1 will always be 2, so to speak.  For instance, If we look back into our evolutionary past, all forms of higher life have had one base arm type bone, then two bones, then multipul bones attached to that at the end of the arm area. Look at skeletons. They all form similar patterns like that."
aliens,3bh3dh,bli123z,3,Tue Jun 30 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"Virtually every animal on Earth has double helix DNA. That's hardly a prerequisite for having a humanoid form, much less to look indistinguishable from a human.  What I'm saying is that for this alien race to look exactly like us, we would have to be directly related. In fact, we'd have to be the same species. Given that they're much more advanced, plus we know we haven't colonized - much less seeded - other planets, the only conclusion that makes sense is that we ARE them: They must have come to Earth in the past and stayed. But this doesn't make sense for reasons I stated above. At least none that I can think of.  I like stuff like this, don't get me wrong. Great post. But it just doesn't make sense. I'm not saying it's wrong, just that it makes no sense to my limited knowledge."
aliens,3bh3dh,dazegoby,2,Tue Jun 30 07:42:18 2015 UTC,"Differing opinions should always have a voice in the search of truth. Your fine.   I'll even throw in another chemical to this mixture. If it's true some of them can manipulate time itself, who's to say the ones who are humanoid aren't us from a different time?   There are too many directions this whole area of thought can go. It's truely mind boggling."

aliens,3bgh2b,zeuph,7,Mon Jun 29 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you. If people browsing this sub really believe that the alien phenomena is real then it isn't a frogleap to assume that they could make some sort of contact with someone? Of course there's hoaxers and insane people but this does not mean they should be dismissed without reason. Fox was not that badly treated though, in my opinion. There were threads pointing out flaws in his story which is fine. But I remember comments like ""Someone claim to be in contact with aliens ans you guys believe him?! So gullible"". I was also called gullible because I tried to have a open mind where I neither disbelieve nor believe someone.  People seem so eager to be the first one to debunk a ""hoaxer"" because then they get 1st price or something, and the ""right to ridicule believers"". You're not in school anymore."

aliens,3bgh2b,Deedubau,3,Mon Jun 29 00:55:22 2015 UTC,I'm tired of seeing people new here come into this sub and demand proof to make them a believer.
aliens,3bgh2b,godsayshi,5,Tue Jun 30 00:56:01 2015 UTC,Opening with aliens are real and that you just have to believe is the opening theme song to every Disney girl flick doing little to make rationale thinkers compassionate to your cause. You come across as biased. Being open minded means entertaining the possibIlity. You are asking for more than that.
aliens,3bgh2b,Dibblerius,5,Mon Jun 29 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"True haha I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a fan of those Disney movies, but yeah that's a fair point. Although, the sub does open with: ""Non-terrestrial and non-earth originating life is absolute. This cosmos we live in, we so recently have taken stock of- is teeming with life."" I'm just aiming for people trying to be more open minded to others opinions, rather than just the open mindedness to ETs."
aliens,3bgh2b,butteryoatmeal,2,Mon Jun 29 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"Indeed it does state that in the sidebar to my great disappointment as absolute conviction without scientific proof is per definition a religion.   As far as I can interpret it only states the absolute of alien life existing, possibly as an interpretation of an almost infinite universe. I does not state any absolutes about aliens being here, having been here, or of which kind exists.   If I would have read that into the context of the side bar I would no longer be here.   It should be interesting to see now with a returning mod recruiting new mods if any clarity regarding those standpoints might emerge.   Anyways I think your general idea of open minds a good one but with an acceptance of wild un-supported claims of truth so also should expressing disbelief be acceptable."
aliens,3bgh2b,Dibblerius,5,Mon Jun 29 02:30:30 2015 UTC,"Experiencers, abductees, and witnesses need to be able to post without the requirement of substantiation.  It seems unlikely that ET is going to seek out people with equipment set up to record such an encounter.  They don't seek out scientists to validate their existence.  They show up where they show up.  Sometimes people are there.  But to expect people to obsessively carry around equipment that only might record craft and being is kind of a lot to expect.  This sub would serve virtually no purpose if that were the case.    All knowledge starts from somewhere.  Shutting it down because it's hearsay serves no one.  Direct personal experience is the best you're going to get until disclosure happens.  If you can't accept that then really, you need to ask yourself why you feel compelled to comment anyway."
aliens,3bgh2b,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'm impressed!   I feel like I shouldn't agree with you but In a sense I do.   I don't propose however that disbelieving is not accepting the value of a personal account for something. I propose that it could help people!  If someone thought they have come across something alien on faulty grounds a disbelieving argument could open their mind to other possibilities. It serves to solidify why they are convinced by tackling those perspectives or it serves to give tools to question if they really should be that convinced.   Even an outright dismissive stance could serve a purpose as it stands to be the opposite of blind belief. They are two extremes which can both in their own right shed light on the origins of our convictions.   I could flip your very intelligent question suggesting that if one can't accept that post will be hearsay why comment in the first place. If you didn't want honest reactions to your post or if you can't accept that people are not always going to blindly believe the validity of what you say why did you want people to read it in the first place?   I would agree with your thoughts though and that there is little purpose if tell-tales are not accepted. That they make up the bulk of sources on this sub.   ...but if we never question, if we never disbelieve  Are we anything but a cult of yay-sayers then?"
aliens,3bgh2b,numinos1,4,Mon Jun 29 10:38:59 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned before here that I have personally been in two different occasions where half of the people present could see the inexplicable orange light in the sky and half could not.  A while later, two others unknown to us came past with one pointing at the still visible light in the sky while the other simply could not see the light in question.  If these things follow our physical laws, how is this possible?    How do you document these things?  How do you prove anything at all?  As with ghosts and any other form of paranormal or supernatural phenomena, the burden of proof requires more than we currently have technologically available to us.  We simply haven't created sensory equipment capable of detecting these things at a price that the common man can afford.  It is alleged that bodies which have such equipment cannot share this information with the public.  I don't need to remind you that this is why forums exist for this very reason.    What is the point of making demands for such evidence when it's simply not feasible to provide?  To discredit experiencers.  But what can you do?  Sweep it under the carpet?  Who is going to go about making these inquiries then?  People have been ridiculed into silence for long enough.  We've heard all the insults and name-calling.   This is why I would like to see a new approach to the way we address experiencers.  I would like to let everyone, no matter how far-fetched and crazy something may sound, just have their say.  Eventually, as with all things, the falsehoods will make their way to the surface and you'll be left with enough compelling evidence for truth to emerge.  Even if it ends up being super-secret military craft or whatever else, why shouldn't we be able to discuss our observations about our world freely and without fear of attack?  We kill the truth when we make irrational and unfeasible demands for evidence.  On not one occasion of my sightings have I had anything that could record evidence.  There were other witnesses, but no way to provide evidence.  You've seen youtube videos about UFO sightings, right?  Most common comments here ""omfg that's so shaky"" ""wtf man hold the camera still"" ""potato image -1"".  I'm frankly a little suspicious when I see clear images with no shaking or hysterical dialogue.  Unless you happen to live in a UFO corridor or have multiple sightings under your belt, it's an amazing event that doesn't leave you unshaken.    If we're going to have forums for discussion, we need to get the info out and flowing.  As long as we have people stifling that flow and humiliating/trolling witnesses, we're not going to get anything substantial.  We need to create a comfortable and safe environment for people to state their claims -- evidence or not.  Evidence won't grow until we allow it to.  If we keep crushing anyone who comes out with first hand observations, we won't be any better off than we were fifty years ago.  We don't have much more now.  But it's time.  We need to let ET out of the closet."
aliens,3bgh2b,Dibblerius,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"This! What would be the point of this sub if nobody shared their crazy experiences? I come here for the personal stories, not the hard scientific evidence.   Why? Because it simply doesn't exist... At least not within the reach of any of us. Only nation states have the resources to pursue the hard evidence. The best we can hope to do here is share interesting stories and enjoy the ride.  That doesn't mean we need to check our brain at the door when we read this sub though. Critical thinking skills and intelligent commentary are what make this fun and interesting.   But holding people's feet to the fire because they can't substantiate their claims is lunacy! This is /r/aliens, not /r/science. Nobody is going to ever have any compelling scientific evidence of extraterrestrial life, at least not by any of us any time soon.   After all, isn't that why we are all here? If there was even one shred of evidence, we would be on /r/science discussing it right now."
aliens,3bgh2b,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:06:29 2015 UTC,"Ok!   You make some great points! I just want us also not to go overboard in the other direction where no one dares question anything.   I am always suspicious, always sceptical and hard to impress, but I'd like to think I'm not crushing or ridiculing people if I doubt what they are saying. I may be guilty of the latter if I have felt the post is an intentional hoax or not sincere.   I'll try to be mindful of that in the future."
aliens,3bgh2b,NorthChan,2,Mon Jun 29 22:57:17 2015 UTC,"Purely for the sake of clarity to anyone and everyone reading this:  I was not pointing fingers.  I rarely even look at usernames when reading comments so I'm not singling anyone out either way.  From my perspective, the ""logical, rational skeptics"" are often far more ludicrous than the ""deliberate hoaxer"".    Something else I feel cannot be overstated is that when dealing with anything paranormal or supernatural, the lines between what is ""acceptable unbelievable"" and what is ""beyond belief"" can only be very bloody hard to draw.  I've seen plenty of things that have pushed my limits at times, but I will not allow others who were not even there to assert their ""well after the fact and nowhere in the vicinity"" -judgment on my experience.    What we have here, as with all things, is intent.  What do we gain by shutting down true experiencers who have had a glimpse of what may be very real indeed but that pushes our concept of acceptable reality?  What do we lose by entertaining even quite fantastical stories from ""hoaxers""?  If Stephen King came here and told us an absolutely implausible account of a sighting/contact, how many of you would call him out as a lunatic?  Not one of you.  But look at what he does for a living.  Those stories are his bread and butter.  Would he lie?  Would he hoax?  What would he gain?  What does anyone gain from lies?  And really, if someone needs attention that badly, they want to spin a yarn, they want someone in this very unkind world to listen to them for a minute, why is it too hard to do that?   And now one more thing I wish to add here right along those lines.  I would like to see all accounts, ""obvious hoax"" or not, to be posted and not ridiculed.  I would really like to see policy here to reflect the search, not the shooting down.  We are all of sufficient intelligence to discern for ourselves.  We don't need any more intellectual babysitters than we already have in the world.  If you have nothing to state in proof of someone confabulating stories, then you really have nothing to state at all about it.  There is no requirement to comment. It has been my experience that when people attack others, it's because of their own fear.  If someone's story bothers you a great deal, please take the time to examine that inside yourself."
aliens,3bgh2b,Miz4r_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:16:25 2015 UTC,Fox and earthsnotmyhome were both upvoted.  Kdigi was a crazy liar and deserved to be downvoted and banned.  Good riddance.
aliens,3bgh2b,Sisko-ire,2,Mon Jun 29 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"Fox was also a crazy liar in my opinion, but I never downvoted him or k_digi because my opinion is not fact and I feel they have the right to share their story. Notice how Fox himself was always being nice and respectful towards k_digi and even claimed their alien friends knew him very well. Now I believe Fox is full of shit of course, but that's no reason to treat him with disrespect or downvote crowd him. If you people would have treated k_digi with more respect I'm sure this sub would have been a lot more pleasant to read. I didn't mind reading k_digi's threads at all even though I didn't believe most of it (some of his posts I did find to have some merit though), it's just the constant hostile attitude against him that got on my nerves. I hope k_digi comes back soon, although he's still here under a different name so he's not actually gone."

Even if it did happen.   If everyone just accepted every crazy story as fact this sub would die a death very quickly and descend into reptilian overlord insanity.    Its the crazy fake stories that have done all the damage to this subject. Its up to the OP to be convincing and every OP with an alien story but no evidence should be reasonable enough to understand that their story is hard to believe and thus jump at the chance to answer any question with honesty and detail.

If the OP communicates rationally, openly and honestly then the majority will have more time for him.   Its very very very simple. People pick up on things simple by the way its been communicated.  AKA IF the OP writes a post where everyone thinks he's a BS artist or crazy, then its the fucking OP's fault for communicating in such a way.   ""So because it sounds crazy to you, it should be dismissed. Got it."" Really don't want to get into schoolyard playground style debating with you. I'm simply explaining to you the mentality of a group and the physiological reactions people have given the context of everything. The reaction is reasonable given all the factors.

The extent to which they fully disclose how much they actually know, and what time frame they choose to do it in, is anyone's guess.   Personally, I believe the government will never fully disclose anything that the media doesn't feel comfortable reporting on. They are also not very likely to admit how many lies they have been spewing. On the whole, the Higher Intellegences will be calling the shots as to what the general public will be told. The media would probably be very easy to monitor for them, and those who fall out of line with THIER agenda would be rooted out swiftly. Heck, that's probably already going on.   S' how I see it."

But then again I'm not American nor do I subscribe to any one theory about how this world works or whatever. But I do feel if if there is evidence of alien interaction with humanity, that world governments are keeping hidden, and if some UFO's really ARE Alien craft... well... I do feel such a thing could not really remain hidden in my life time what with how fast we are progressing. Our own tech means its only a matter of time before joe soap public gets its own evidence outside of government need.   The internet and camera phones are only relatively new, imagine how things will be in another 20-30 years. Singularity, inventing our own AI etc etc.    Think of all those famous ufo abduction stories you've heard of that were extremely compelling, now imagine if this event took place in modern times, the person in question easily has a means to film the entire event and upload it to the internet all from the device he has in his pocket.   Sooooo if this is TRUE then its only a matter of time before someone finally gets some evidence."

I think we still don't know the massive effects its going to have on humanity or indeed what it will even be like in 50 years. People forget just how new the internet is, but people will look at us when we are old and think in wonder at ""wow, that guy was alive BEFORE there was even internet! I can't imagine"" etc and ""wow that guy was alive BEFORE the year 2000! Crazy"" So I do think we are living in an extremely fast moving technological age and are lucky to be alive to witness how things change over the next 50 years etc.   I just can't help but think finally answering if we are alone or not is very likely to happen in our life times too.

aliens,3bgy8t,zeuph,3,Mon Jun 29 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think governments will ever give full disclosure. It's up to the people to discover these things themselves and spread it. This is definitely possible nowadays with the internet and the way we can communicate and share information. Information is no longer centrally controlled or at least we're growing out of that phase now. We just need to learn to weed out the crap and disinformation, but I'm sure this will sort itself out eventually over time. But relying on the government to tell us what is and is not true is a thing of the past, this is not how disclosure will happen in my opinion. Disclosure will be a bottom-up process and not top-down, and this subreddit is a small part of it as well I think, we're all a part of it. And this is how it should be, the power is slowly but surely flowing back into the hands of the people. :)"
aliens,3bgy8t,Ellen1957,3,Mon Jun 29 11:10:52 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that the government(U.S) will disclose anything without pressure or some kind of outside force(mass sighting, other leaders disclosure etc). However I believe we're in a disclosure time right now, the percentage of people who believe in the alien phenomena(that we're being visited at the current time) are increasing drastically.   Either the people will manage to pressure the congress to make a formal hearing on the subject, or the president will disclose this in a manner like Stephen Bassett describes. That would be the formal types. The informal could be the vatican, the queen, Putin or/and many other type of phenomena. Scoff you say ""That's ridiculous why would any of these be interested in these kinds of things?"". If you've come this far and got through all the bullshit out there that exists, then this would easily be convincing. All of these three are in the know, they're all in positions of power(the president of the united states is not in this type of power position), all of which would/should have a interest on the subject. By removing all the type of ""addons"" that come with the subject of ""aliens"" and ""UFOs"" can easily be removed to show a very easy to read picture and this is was Stephen Bassett brings forward.   This is the subject I'm involved with right now the most. It's becoming extremely close to some kind of disclosure, however this have been said for some years now. As the time goes by, the closer we are to a disclosure. Beyond any doubt is this a phenomena that exists(The cover-up aka truce embargo, UFO phenomena and the presence of extra terrestrial life on earth). Because this phenomena exists, people will start to wonder as to why they're not informed. There's no excuses anymore because the military clearly states that this is not the case, they're not confirming these phenomenas and because of that are they lying. Why? Because the presence of extra terrestrial life on planet earth and/or UFOs is a threat to national security.   There's a lot of good talks on this subject.  My favorite ufologist with my favorite topic: Richard Dolan A.D, After Disclosure  Stephen Bassett is really really good at making statements on this subjects that's relevant for the people and politics.  1 2  Some of these might be old but they're still very good in my opinion. Stephen Bassett could really be someone of great significant when it comes to the Disclosure."

I imagine it was really a response to 'how he talked about it'. Thus some people eventually just responded negatively to anything he talked about.   Honestly. I think he wanted to be banned. As it would be conformation bias for him and his world view. He was banned from cryptocurrency subreddits and UFO's because of his behavior also.   And all that drama feeds into his fantasy that he's just providing the truth and government agents run these subforums and are battling against him. It adds to his self importance.   He will argue that he was banned from this subforum to many others, all because he was too close to the truth and ""the man"" did not like that. Any attempt to show him that its just how he behaves himself, and not the topic he's talking about, he will just ignore as he has no answer to this.   Also the very fact that he's now in this very thread with one of his alt accounts is a little embarrassing.  Can mods not see the background details of users with multiple accounts?"
aliens,3b4m6n,NorthChan,4,Fri Jun 26 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"I never pm you.  Go back to his earlier posts.  He needs some professional help.  I really hope he reaches out to someone for help.  This isn't the first sub that he has been banned from, or been called crazy in.    He refused to answer legit questions, and constantly changed his story.  It was all just spam.  Not freedom of speech.   He still thinks that I work for mj12 or the cia.  He has all of the classic delusional signs of mental illness.  His writting and communication is one of the most blaring signs.    Just my two cents. Thanks for finally get rid of him."
aliens,3b4m6n,godsayshi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:18:20 2015 UTC,I actually want to see some of this.

aliens,3b4m6n,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"Insanity. I can find it by his name. Most entertaining. Cross post to /r/psychology, ask for diagnosis."
aliens,3b4m6n,rabidoverlord,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:43:13 2015 UTC,Is there a genuine problem or did they just disagree with his POV?  Is there a reason his speculation (wild or not) can't be voiced here?  What exactly were the genuine problems?  Or was it intellectual vanity of the part of the complainants?  Why is there not room for everyone to voice their respective viewpoints?    I see unwarranted downvoting here and it's really a problem.  It slips opposing experiences and perspectives below the popularly held ideas.  Something needs fixing here in a big way.  Sterilization of input isn't the thing though.
aliens,3b4m6n,NorthChan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think there's a fundamental problem with people wanting only the sorts of stories that conform to what they've seen on tv.  Because a video ""has been debunked"" is still only relevant if you aren't willing to look more broadly than just what we expect to find.  In that same sense, we can say that we are the only life in the universe if we restrict our concept of sentience to what we understand it to be.  Our understanding of it is in all likelihood shallow due to our own limited perspectives -- intellectual as well as physical."
aliens,3b4m6n,ThePikafan01,2,Fri Jun 26 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know if banning him was the right thing or not. It's not my call. I will say that it was pretty shitty that several users seem to have gone to his user profile and downvoted literally everything he posted. That's not fair."
aliens,3b4m6n,zigzagpioneer,2,Fri Jun 26 04:50:45 2015 UTC,"The guy was straight up crazy.  Go read his ama.  Anyone who asked him legit hard questions or found inconsistencies in what he said he immediately called them names, or assumed they were part of a government agency.  The guy spammed the sub with complete bull.  Good riddance."
aliens,3b4m6n,ArdRi_,4,Sun Jun 28 03:54:30 2015 UTC,"He called me a monkey at one point, I don't enjoy the guy"
aliens,3b4m6n,NorthChan,3,Fri Jun 26 17:38:35 2015 UTC,"It was never a problem with what he had to say, I was even interested in what he first had to share, but he quickly escalated because he could not handle critique and used other peoples stories to fuel his own. He often spoke to other people (as calling me a monkey) in a bad manner and he shifted from being average joe to proclaiming himself an celestial being sent to earth to teach us a lesson. It is in human nature and especially the ""reddit-kind of people"" to have doubt in proclaimed authority. So he caused a controversy, and other from u/theearthisnotmyhome who swooned us with his humble nature, kolin was hostile and it was to his disadvantage. It all boils down to what we choose to believe, what resonates with our version with truth. Until the real one is out there, we'll never know and we will keep on having these trust issues..."
aliens,3b4m6n,butteryoatmeal,4,Sat Jun 27 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm all for expressing one's own ideas.   However people self posting their own abduction or contact stories don't achieve anything.   My gripes with kdigi were based entirely on the tone he adapted to express his opinions. He tried to hijack various threads through manipulation, adding to the OP's details with some of his own information. How he treated Fox's thread on contact was enough tosee him removed from the community. He went to great lengths to counter what Fox had said and garner attention. When none came his way he posted an amendment to all of his previous information saying he had verified what was said with his contacts.   The same was done with theearthisnotmyhome."
aliens,3b4m6n,pharmaphilreview,3,Fri Jun 26 10:55:50 2015 UTC,Well said.

aliens,3b4m6n,NorthChan,6,Sun Jun 28 16:06:25 2015 UTC,Thanks
aliens,3b4m6n,mrgdh,5,Thu Jun 25 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"I liked to think there was some validity to his claims. However if everything was fictitious, what's the big deal?   The entertainment industry has worked relentlessly over the last century to help prepare the average human mind for the complexities of encountering extra terrestrial life.  The fact that many people on this sub had issues reconciling what he had to say as some sort of ""fact"" makes me wonder if they're not as ready as they think they are.  Yes, you're going to come firing at me with ""it's not that we don't believe in ET's but he was crazy, he kept forcing people to his blog, his claims made no sense, he's lying, he's never met ET's, blah blah"". Your lack of experiences are not a grounds to be prejudiced and judgmental.   If anything, k-digi gave you the opportunity to start thinking about ET's from perspectives you might never have and which one day may possibly be the reality you need to reconcile with your own.  Peace"
aliens,3b4m6n,butteryoatmeal,3,Fri Jun 26 01:32:33 2015 UTC,Kdigi often would one day claim he was an et and the next he would say he was human.  Then the next day he would claim he was born a human with the soul of an et.  He could never keep his lies straight.  He was spamming his web page for ad revenue.  He made up terrible lies to make money off this sub.  Good riddance.
aliens,3b4m6n,magnetic_disc,-3,Sun Jun 28 03:57:35 2015 UTC,I feel he should come back. If only for the entertainment value. Ban him again for good if he violates the rules.
aliens,3b4m6n,ArdRi_,-1,Fri Jun 26 02:41:44 2015 UTC,It's very difficult to post anything (even comments) on this sub because of these roving bands of bullies.  I made a thread that was downvoted to hell and virtually anything I post now comment-wise is instantly downvoted.  /r/psychic has been similar but the mods are now taking that under control.  I'm both surprised and encouraged to see it happening here too.
aliens,3b4m6n,magnetic_disc,-5,Fri Jun 26 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"I feel its is impossible to really ""ban"" him and he is playing a game with the people that don't want information to spread, if this was Chess, he virtually forced you to take an action which will only hurt this place as a free flowing information node.  To explain that try to look at {information} as water that will always find a consensus equilibrium.   by banning him here and giving those that want to block this ""water"" from flowing what they want, you cause it to flow in a different direction I think that place right now is obviously ""Voat"" which is why he was talking about it.  So this ""tap"" got turned off and the flow moves to that place after a critical mass of information flows there.  TLDR  You done what he wanted, highlighting your flaws and the flaws of this place, he can still get the message across, so the ""agents"" of silence can not ""win"".  If you are trying to block information flow you will always have the odds stacked against you, your options are very limited and action you take often hurts you.  We don't want to hurt you,  but you hurt yourselves sometimes."

aliens,3b4zd2,Dibblerius,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:04:46 2015 UTC,It really is something that can only be experienced first hand. Experiencing something like this in your own backyard is exciting and an experience I recommend for anyone.

aliens,3b4zd2,AbbotTheCabbot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:53:26 2015 UTC,"Another interesting fact, the moons of Jupiter orbit it (of course). This means that the moons' distance between each other will change with time."

They wobbled a bit too, These crafts all came from different directions very fast much faster than a plane or helicopter slowed extremely quickly, then went into the described formation and stayed there until the clouds came. However one of the crafts I noticed when I first saw them took off like a shooting star it looked like from the distance I was at maybe within 30-50m of another crafts, then disappeared in an instant just like a shooting star."
aliens,3b4zd2,BarbarianSasquatch,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:46:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The 2nd photo of the formation looks out of the ordinary. I asked about the lights because one of the craft I've seen had slowly pulsating lights on each side of a gray diamond. What was so strange was that they appeared to be high intensity LEDs but at the time, blue LEDs hadn't been invented yet."

aliens,3b3rbw,Virtual_Safety_Car,3,Fri Jun 26 02:34:17 2015 UTC,You should ban /u/_k_digi on your sub.

He is not offensive or rude, he does post more often than the regular person but you can easily ignore his posts if you don't like them. I don't like censoring or banning people unless they constantly break the rules."

aliens,3b3rbw,BassBeerNBabes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen those remarks and I found them hardly offensive in their context, about as offensive as people calling him crazy or schizo in here so if he's banned for those remarks the people calling him crazy should also be banned. Besides it's not his 'offensive' remarks that people want him banned for they just don't want his posts to clutter up this sub anymore because they find it crazy talk and nonsensical, and they're annoyed by this. I can understand this, but I don't think it's a good enough reason for a ban."

aliens,3b3rbw,aflex01,3,Thu Jun 25 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. There are a few users who seem to post questionable quality material to these subs. It's their privilege to get to post and be moderated accordingly. When the material becomes offensive or ad hominem, that's when it's time to put the brakes on their privilege.  There's a fine line between objective and subjective contribution though. I can't speak for these people, they are essentially anonymous. However, there is question as to the age or sanity with some of these posters. I really think that it's easy to forget behind the wall of text, you don't know who's posting. They may be 14 year old kids vying for attention or locked up psych inmates with a minute to access the computer. When reading a new source, you should always keep this in mind, and recognize that, if it's not a complete troll, this is the reality that this person is experiencing. So until they break the rules, they have the privilege to express their beliefs."

The ufo/alien community is full of a wide range of people, some peddling, some ill, some educated professionals, some new-age hippies, etc...

With the variety of claims and theories on who are out there/here all of them can't be right by one contact being announced and presented by Obama.  Given that most people that aren't ufologists also consider extraterrestrial life likely an ""I told you so"" would be a highly inappropriate (but perhaps likely) response.   I suspect if a real god revealed it self a lot religions would respond in a similar fashion even if it didn't match up any better with their beliefs than that of others."

But, the entire Ancient Aliens theory flies in the face of hardcore, substantiated, scientific fact. Period.

I just watched it, I never communicated with it. It was the most amazing thing Ive ever seen."

aliens,3b0i59,canadiancarcass,8,Sat Jun 27 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I've done the smoked version of DMT over 100 times. I've encountered crystal clear alien intelligence, some very profound non-human intelligence. There's clearly another ""dimension."" Tons of ayahuasca stories recount even more vivid interactions with this ""mother"" intelligence. If you're really interested in the subject, I strongly recommend the book ""The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge"" by Jeremy Narby, as well as ""Supernatural"" by Graham Hancock. There was also a large-scale study of ayahuasca experiences by an Israeli professor named Benny Shanon, who published a book about it called, ""The Antipodes of the Mind."" And there's a famous book and accompanying movie (on youtube) called ""DMT: The Spirit Molecule.""   I think these DMT experiences are the most reliable of encountering ""aliens."" Many people encounter beings in their journeys. Google ""340 DMT trip stories"" for a lot. As far as ayahuasca, you can read trip reports on www.erowid.org, and there's a small subreddit, /r/ayahuasca. There's also /r/psychonaut.  My DMT experiences have been by a long shot the most moving and powerful moments of my life, and I look forward to doing ayahuasca in a good setting. Oh, and if you're look to do a retreat at some point, there's a web site www.ayaadvisor,org that's like a yell of South American ayahuasca spots.  Also, two Ayahuacsa documentaries on youtube that I liked: ""Metamorphosis"" and ""Stepping Into the fire."""

aliens,3b0i59,Village_ponce,3,Fri Jun 26 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"There's kind of no way to prepare for it on a deeper level. I'm still nervous as fuck even thinking about it- nervous but also intensely excited every time; it's the real real deal. DMT is very friendly, though, despite being so insanely intense. There's no dark energy in it at all. If you're ready for a breakthrough then you'll have one; if not then you'll just have an awesome, very fun, sub-breakthrough ride. Almost no one doesn't enjoy DMT, which is telling.  On a practical level there is a way to prepare, though. Make sure you avoid caffeine that day and eat healthy (just meaning avoiding sugary junk). Obviously, plan it out in a peaceful, quiet, ideally dark, setting. Don't do it at a party, and obviously don't mix it with alcohol. I'm sure you know this. But, also, there's a really specific way to do it mechanistically. You vaporize it; don't just mix it in a pipe with weed or something. Take HUGE hits, and hold them in for as long as you reasonably can, like eight to ten seconds. Really hold the hits in. You have a short window of time- maybe forty-five seconds to a minute- before you start to come up HARD, so you want to get as much in you as possible before it hits. Then just let go... Close your eyes, and put the pipe down. I like to meditate for a while beforehand, too, like an hour of just sitting there focusing. The more tranced out (or tranced in) you already are, the more likely that you'll get to the other side.   For inspiration, if you've never heard them before, punch ""Terence McKenna DMT"" into youtube, and listen to his stories."

Now if you were able to infiltrate and do whatever you like to a planet without getting noticed. Wouldn't that be the better way? Being able to conduct experiments and socialise with the beings inhabiting the planet might be of high value for some.  To even assume how they would interact with us in a invasional manner would be of absolute arrogance to think that we can even comprehend  the way they interact with our world.  What if their moral are to an extreme? Then surely they could oversee a invasion to spare our lifes. On the other hand what if they have an extreme amount of patience? Then maybe they will just use us until they easily could wipe us out.  Before thinking about these kinds of possibilities I feel the need to map out their cultural behaviors

His math said there should be a planet in that orbit. The article you linked mentioned that the mass of the asteroid belt is only sufficient for a small moon size planet.

They (the Mahar, defined as an ""extraterrestrial race"") will save a portion of humanity just before the destruction of the world.  ""Inherent in this body of knowledge is an understanding of the cycles of creation and destruction which, in conjunction with astronomical phases, determine the life span of the species.

I've had a difficult time accepting the theory of humanity's ""passive"" participation in regards to cognitive, cultural, and environmental evolution. I feel like it allows us to relinquish a huge sense of responsibility and stunts our development as would a child constantly manufacturing excuses for its own mysterious behavior.  And I couldn't agree more; we already have everything we need to survive and thrive on this planet, regardless of ET intervention. We just need to let our stone-age psychological monkey brains catch up with our cataclysmic weapons and planet poisoning behavior patterns.  Inb4 I get crucified: I absolutely 100% believe in complex and intelligent extra terrestrial life. I believe that lifeforms outside of our knowledge HAVE communicated with our species in one way or another, maybe even manipulated us to fit their own agendas (though I don't know how we would know). I just have a hard time ascribing to dogma, and the way in which ""hardcore"" believers seem to wait at the window for their interventionalist Alien love gardeners as would an Evengelical for the second coming of Christ... just doesn't sit right with me.

aliens,3asyz3,PoopShooTwenty2,24,Tue Jun 23 06:59:10 2015 UTC,"Engineer here.   Sure, in arithmetic you get some niceties of working in a number system of base 6. The Babylonians figured this shit out years ago. That's why we have 360 degrees in a circle, and 24 hours in a day.   But when it comes down to algebra, there's not really any advantage to using a different number system. Algebra is about relationships between quantities. F=ma describes the relationship between force, mass and acceleration. You can still use this formula in a base 6 number system, but you may need to introduce a coefficient to keep your units correct.   I think your problem here is that you don't really know enough math to explain your idea of higher intelligence math. I also don't really know enough math because Engineers deal with applied mathematics, not pure mathematics. I know that there are some pretty simple equations that we can't solve yet. If I ever met an alien the first thing I'd do is set up a voice recorder ask them to explain string theory and quantum mechanics.

aliens,3asyz3,SomeDudeCalledMatt,3,Tue Jun 23 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. It's nice to hear from someone who knows a bit more about math than I do.   I'd imagine, us Humans trying to understand the systems (math or otherwise) They may use, would be like a chimpanzee trying to understand how a jet engine works. The brain structure needed to visualize such concepts just isn't there.  What frightens me, is the possibility of brain augmentation. If Humans use technology to artificially boost brain function (in order to ""catch up""), it could lead to an evolutionary dead end. The dying off of some ""Grays"" as a species seems to be a recurring theme spoken of by contactees. The only logical conclusion I can think of is, they've damaged themselves somehow with thier technology. I remember hearing a testimonial from a government doctor who examined a corpse, and he said their brain had 3 lobes. The one in the front of the two base hemispheres was heavily augmented with some sort of technology. My memory may be playing tricks, but that's what I can recall.  If anyone can add to this, please do."

And almost shows a lack of respect of us.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that paralyzing someone against their own will and making them feel like they are never safe in their own bed could be a severely psychologically damaging thing to do."

However I'd still disagree.   If apes start inventing their own tech, communicating with us , inventing their own culture language and so on. I personally think humanity would treat them very different to how we treat them now.  I just don't think its a good argument to say ""look how we treat animals, sure the aliens are just being like us"". No, there is a line. There is a certain level of intelligence a creature can get that crosses that creature from being just an animal, to being a sentient being, self aware intelligent entity.

They did not seem too interested in conversing with awake me.  Woke up 4 hours later and jumped out of bed.  No traces of them except I had a sore jaw, and memories of the bit when I was awake.    Although that was the first time in my life I ever woke up 'paralysed', I had 3 more weird paralysis episodes in the subsequent 2 years, I am positive it was them each time, but I never directly saw them consciously again.

It injected a large amount of energy into my leg, so much energy it felt like it was disconnected from my body.    I got scared but then it said to ""move everything"" i was able to move my bad leg as if it wasn't injured at all.

Its very interesting stuff, may I ask you though, what was it that convinced you that this was you speaking and interacting with another being rather than you communicating with your own sub conscience?"
aliens,3asrh7,FeignedSanity,4,Tue Jun 23 08:57:02 2015 UTC,"Prior to delving into meditation and psychedelics, I was a huge skeptic. I was raised being taught to think for myself and use logic and science. I convinced myself that there was more to it all because I could achieve some of the results while not on the drugs, but even while on them I could go about my daily life just fine, not bothered by the changes in perspective or visuals.   But then I could go seclude myself and meditate and experience the indescribable, and feel the greatest and most profound feelings and emotions, as well as some of the scariest. But by keeping confidence in myself and my powerful mind I tried to simply learn what the experiences are and represent better.  I believe people become fearful and scared of these experiences because they are not ready to handle their most inner mind and open themselves to the strangest and newest experiences, sights and feelings. Many of these experiences are truly ""out of this world"" inner strength, confidence and radiating an aura of peace and love I believe is the best way to become comfortable and learn from them.  I'm still early in my journey of opening up my the full potential of my mind and body, looking forward to learning more and have recently been focusing on better mastering my meditation."

It's interesting that you mentioned that you need to get rid of basically all negative emotions to communicate with them because I understand that's the key to having a successful meditation session and communicating with many types of higher beings without needing any kind of psychedelics. I doubt most people could easily achieve this though, because many people (at least from what I've seen here) expect a desired outcome when it comes with having an encounter like this.  *as for the whole reason why you are here on earth that goes beyond Aliens and belief in the afterlife.

Its necessary to grow spiritually, an easy life will not help you grow or look inside yourself for the strength to push forward.    Once I read THOTH (many of my friends kept bringing him up and finally a guy on the internet said I need to read that book).  My mind was blown away.  I realized my mission is really a mission, a mission that has been told over and over again.  To help raise the vibrational frequency of the planet but helping so many people in the darkness see the light and its working.  I cannot wait to help even more people so if you see the light brother pass it on to as many people as possible. We need more than just a few of us to do this job, and the ones that need us the most are the most lost but produce the greatest frequency because its the contrast of dark and light."
aliens,3asrh7,FeignedSanity,2,Thu Jul 2 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think that meeting and dealing with higher dimensional entities is of our primary concern as humans right now. They depend on our thoughts and beliefs to manifest themselves in this reality so as long as people don't think and believe in them they won't bother us much. They can be helpful too I guess but I don't think humanity as a whole is ready for this kind of contact at this moment. Some humans perhaps are, but you can't underestimate what kind of preparation is needed to deal with the astral world in a responsible way. First we will need to become aware and acknowledge the existence of other physical intelligent beings, and learn how to deal with that reality. Gotta take things step by step and not rush forward deep into the unknown and find yourself hopelessly lost."
aliens,3asrh7,ProfMarvel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that most people right now are not prepared for a lot of the deep mental experiences that come from deep meditation, psychedelic drugs and the like. However for those that are already fairly aware of themselves and the world around them, it is usually a pretty smooth transition.   Even if many people don't go to the point of communicating heavily with potential higher dimensional entities, it can help open up the mind to the forces behind life and give a greater understanding and respect for other life forms.  Far too many people see all other animals as non-thinking creatures, when anybody can go watch them for 5 minutes and see how intelligent they can be! Pets clearly have emotions and personalities and learn, how could they not have their own level of intelligence? Just because they have not yet learned to build a body to interact with the physical realm as well as humans have does not decrease their right to strive for a happy and peaceful existence.  It is also really interesting to me to examine the many different levels of human awareness and cognition throughout the world. When I meet people that don't understand the things I have in my knowledge bank, rather than think of them as stupid or inferior, I want to know what knowledge and experience they have gained that I may not understand in their time of physical existence."

Did the perspective in this article come from abductees, former government contacts, or Caucasians wearing feather headdress in Sodona?   From my experience, there is nothing spiritual taking place nor is there any way to discern the motivations of beings that have technologically tweaked their brains so much that, even aside from being alien, their thought processes seem so far removed from ours that cohesive discussion about the phenomena is nearly impossible.  Sure, speculation is inevitable and entertaining, but really only useful to us as a form of catharsis when faced with something so literally amazing. The tone of authority on websites like these are really just a tactic to sell books. Notice the, ""read the 1st book for free"" near the bottom.

As long as one doesn't go on as if they've fallen for any of the various narratives that is, I find most intelligent people wonder about such things a least a little sometimes too.

aliens,3alvup,Miz4r_,6,Thu Jun 25 12:32:23 2015 UTC,I figure that's an odd and presumptuous assumption that all nature dominates when we have very little insight on the rest of the universe.

The ones left behind are here for their own interests and not ours, and humanity's challenge is to assert its freedom and sovereignty and unite in the face of these forces from the outside. Assuming that all aliens care about our freedom and are here to work for our benefit is a lot more presumptuous and dangerous, so true or not these briefings do point out something we have to take into consideration.

aliens,3alvup,no1113,3,Mon Jun 22 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"Well, the evidence does seem to suggest that they are abducting people, manipulating their memories, and conducting breeding experiments.   It does, but the evidence just as much suggests that it’s not abductions per se that are taking place.  Think about it:  How do you think a Wildebeest in the Serengeti would interpret getting shot with a tranquilizer gun, blind folded, tagged with a radio collar, and then released back to its heard?  Do you think it would have AAAANNNNY idea whatsoever that it is actually part of a conservation program designed to help its numbers, its habitat, and actually save its species?  Likely not.  Likely, the Wildebeest will explain to all his buddies that he got summarily abducted, traumatized, had seamen extracted, experienced all kinds of missing time, and now feels absolutely, utterly, irreparably violated.  He might even have to undergo a round of “Wildebeest PTSD group counseling” along with a few of his other buddies…and absolutely no one in the herd will likely believe them anyway…  It’s ultimately all about interpretation.  I have had experiences that were as traumatizing as anything I’ve ever experienced, but I’m not sure they haven’t helped me have a wider, more expanded perspective on what truly exists “out there” than I might otherwise have had.   Whatever's going on, we should definitely do everything we can to oppose this and defend our borders to space.   Imagine if the Wildebeests in the above example said this very thing.  Imagine how misplaced would be their thinking and how utterly wrong they would be in trying to keep themselves from being helped.  This doesn’t mean that some contact experiences aren’t bad or malicious.  Some of them most definitely seem to be.  However, understand that we human beings are a species that is barely reaching out of its infancy as compared to many other space fairing species in the cosmos.  We should not allow ourselves to be fodder to anyone or anything, but we should also know exactly what it is we’re thinking and what we’re getting ourselves into before we move forward with anything, because there is a lot more that we don’t know about what’s out there, what some ETs are doing here, and what they’re doing with us than there is that we do know about any of these issues.  As such, it seems it would be better to be neutral.  Don’t assume it’s some “space brothers from heaven coming down to save us all!!” bullshit, but also don’t think it’s some “space devils from hell invading our planet coming to enslave use all!!” bullshit either."
aliens,3alvup,Miz4r_,0,Mon Jun 22 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"You're taking one hell of a risk. This is our only planet, after all. All our eggs are in this one precious basket.  How can you call for neutrality when advanced foreign crafts are flying around our skies, doing whatever they like? While I'm open to debating the reason why they are abducting people (it's all very mysterious), I can't possibly think that humanity as a whole should react in a neutral fashion to this.  We have a responsibility to protect our race, to ensure our people's survival, to maintain our civilization. This calls for wise discernment of what's happening out there. It calls for caution. It calls for preparation. It calls for advancement. The one thing it does not call for is neutrality. If you don't know what's out there, and it's something that might be extremely harmful to you, then neutrality is the wrong course of action.  What's wrong with protecting our borders to space, as much as we can? What's wrong with denouncing the abduction and manipulation of human beings?"
aliens,3alvup,no1113,0,Mon Jun 22 12:27:01 2015 UTC,"This is our only planet, after all.   Fuck that.  This is NOT our fucking planet.  This is the planet of EVERYTHING that is here already.  This is the dolphins’ planet, the wolves’ planet, felines’ planet, trees’, rocks’, etc, etc.  And if you really want to go “there” with it, this REALLY isn’t our planet if you understand that human beings are likely little more than a genetically-created test tube baby engineered as a slave species by a race far more evolutionarily advanced than we.  At the end of the day, we’ve got fuck all claim to this planet.  And, again, even if we DID actually have some sort of claim - any claim - to this planet, we would still have almost ZERO defense against the majority of the species that are already visiting and staying on this planet!  I mean you really think our shitty, piddly little technology could deal with and handle a species a few million years more advanced than us?  Seriously?  Don’t worry though.  We’re protected by the fact that many ET species on and around this planet are intelligent enough to understand that it’s not we that are valuable and need to be unhurt, but the planet.  Unfortunately, we ourselves as a human species are pieces of shit and don’t treat the planet like we should in the first place.   All our eggs are in this one precious basket.   And look how the fuck we treat it and each other.  How stupid is that?  How much does a species that acts like we generally do deserve to continue being here?  Regardless, there are people with a lot of information showing that the Earth human species is most definitely not confined to this planet alone and we most definitely DON’T have all our “eggs in this one basket”.  Captain Randy Cramer, Lieutenant William Brett Stillings, Corporal Bernard Mendez, attorney Andrew Basiago, and the great grand daughter of president Dwight D. Eisenhower Laura Eisenhower have all gone on record, given various lectures, and have extensively corroborated each other’s testimony that they have visited the planet Mars and that we already have a functioning colony of Earth humans living there.  Additional to all this, there is a lot of evidence in existence strongly indicating that the Earth human species has been created, destroyed, and recreated again and again - wiped out and reseeded - over and over again throughout time immemorial.  As such, your concerns ultimately amount to almost nothing in the larger, cosmic (even planetary) scheme of things.   How can you call for neutrality when advanced foreign crafts are flying around our skies, doing whatever they like?    Some of them have a greater claim to this planet than we do.  And even those that don’t, if they wanted to “take over” humanity (lol), they’d have not only done so by now, but they would have done it veeeery easily.  Your claims basically amount to a chimp who’s in a zoo talking with his other chimp buddies trying to figure out how to keep humans from enslaving them and putting them in a zoo - all the while entirely missing the point of not only where they are, but who they are as chimps as compared to humans in the first place.  If certain ETs wanted to overtly take over the homo sapien race - and they were ALLOWED to - they would have already done so.  No problem.  The fact that there are shit ton of ET craft flying above and in the skies should be nothing to scare you.  It just is what it is.   While I'm open to debating the reason why they are abducting people (it's all very mysterious), I can't possibly think that humanity as a whole should react in a neutral fashion to this.   The best thing humanity can do is develop is internal, spiritual, and psychic abilities - something that the ruling elite on this planet (some of which aren’t human) are greatly keeping us as a whole from doing.  What that means is that we are likely already overtaken - from within/from the inside out - by non-human beings that are keeping us from evolving as best as we could.  Things go muuuuch deeper than I think you understand.   We have a responsibility to protect our race, to ensure our people's survival, to maintain our civilization.   But, man, you don’t even know what our civilization is really composed of in the first place.  There is SO much deceit and chicanery on this planet and there are so many forces - human and non human - working to keep this species subjugated already and as it stands, that the civilization you’re advocating for and trying to protect right now is one that might not actually be better suited destroyed.   This calls for wise discernment of what's happening out there.   And WE DON’T HAVE THAT.  We’re not exercising that wise a discernment as a whole.  This is part of my very point.  If we were, we wouldn’t have the shit civilization that we currently do right now.   It calls for caution. It calls for preparation.   Agreed, but that caution and preparation is one just as well (if not better) applied internally - not in the form of bomb and weapon contracts given to military forces on this planet ruled and controlled by individuals that don’t even have the best interest of the human race in mind in the first place.  Think about that for a minute, and realize that the problems run a lot deeper than just “creating more bombs and fighter planes and lasers to protect us out there!”   It calls for advancement.    Correct - and that advancement is needed internally more than anything you seem to have been talking about and advocating here.   The one thing it does not call for is neutrality.   You make a mistake in thinking this is what I’ve been saying this whole time.  I’ve been talking about self improvement.  That’s not in any way neutrality.  I’ve been telling you that advocating for some stupid “star wars” technology is not well-advised in the least.  Not even close.   If you don't know what's out there, and it's something that might be extremely harmful to you, then neutrality is the wrong course of action.   I don’t disagree with that, but what’s needed in order to protect yourself is a level of collective togetherness in this civilization that WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE by far.  We need to handle THAT first, and we are far from that…and the reason that we are far from that involves the goings on of a lot of the beings DOWN HERE on the ground - not “up there” in space.  As such, that needs to get handled, addressed, and dealt with first, because you can’t defend yourself externally if you’ve already been destroyed, corrupted, and compromised internally.   What's wrong with protecting our borders to space, as much as we can?   The dynamic is a lot more complicated than this, however.  A lot.   What's wrong with denouncing the abduction and manipulation of human beings?   What’s wrong with it is that you don’t understand that we’re doing it to ourselves more than any beings are doing it to us from outside.  I have 100 times more of a problem with the piece of shit, duplicitous politicians and government officials, and corporate elites, and multinational giants fucking us and our planet up than I have with any off planet beings.  You put the multinational types in charge of making these “star wars defense systems” and they will fuck humanity even more than they are ALREADY fucking humanity.  Guarantee it.  If what all the people I referenced above are saying is true (and writing off one person is one thing, but when you have four or five all saying the same thing, it’s a lot tougher to discount them all) then we have a secret, unauthorized, unaligned, unaccounted for runaway civilization that has stolen billions if not trillions of dollars from the humans of Earth and they ALREADY have a working civilization that is existing off planet Earth…and that civilization is existing because the very organizations that you would trust to “protect us” are already completely fucking us over and have already long ago made plans to go on without the rest of the Earth human race.  Again, realize this shit goes a LOT deeper than you’re thinking, and the things that are needed to fix the human problems that are happening on this planet are much more complicated than thinking about “shooting up aliens in space”."

You only disagree about the morality of human abductions and why the aliens are here, and you seem to hold a bit of hatred against humanity in general. Which is understanding given the way we as a collective are taking care of this planet and each other, but hatred or contempt against our own species and expecting aliens to fix our problems or just wipe us off the planet altogether is not the way forward. Anyway I don't think neither you or the OP truly knows or understands our origins and the aliens' motives, so it's a waste to speculate or disagree about that and focus on what's really important instead.

Who said that?  I certainly didn't.  Where'd you get that conclusion from?  Nothing I said even implied that.  We need to solve our own problems.  Nothing wrong with getting a little help if it happens, but at the end of the day, it is US that has to solve things, and that's it.   I don't think neither you or the OP truly knows or understands our origins and the aliens' motives   NO human, it seems, can lay claim to anything like that.  However, there are indeed some conclusions and assessments that are more correct than others.   The AoH briefings can be a valuable tool in helping with just that, and it doesn't go against anything you wrote above.   What are ""the AoH briefings""?"
aliens,3alvup,no1113,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"""Hatred"" is way too strong a word here. Contempt would be more accurate. Alas, unfortunately, it is well-deserved.   Then you hold contempt towards yourself as well, because you are part of humanity. It may be tempting to see ourselves as separate from humanity and become judgmental towards our species, but we're actually all part of the same human family and also share a responsibility towards the way we are behaving. Holding contempt for humanity and having a judgmental attitude is non-productive and self-defeating, even though I have fallen for this trap myself as well sometimes so I can understand it. Accepting responsibility for the way things are without any judgment upon yourself or others is an important first step in my opinion, you need to 'forgive' in order to transcend the wheel of karma that locks us and the rest of humanity in its current state.   What are ""the AoH briefings""?   It's in the OP's post. ;)  Anyway peace and love to you, I'm sure we all basically want the same thing. I believe the Allies of Humanity briefings and the steps to knowledge as a spiritual guide both can be important tools for the people who feel drawn towards it. Your personal path may be different, but I do believe we all share a common goal and I feel we often argue too much about small differences in opinion while the things we have in common are much greater and much more important to focus on. Namaste. :)"
aliens,3alvup,no1113,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:30:29 2015 UTC,"Then you hold contempt towards yourself as well   Duh.  Of course I do.  I’m a human being, after all.  I have no problem going down with the rest of humanity.  Much as what some of the things I’ve said seem to indicate I should, I’m not knocking down any doors to imprison or kill all the world “leaders” and people wrecking havoc on this civilization.  I still drive a combustion engine car, unfortunately, and put fuel in it.  I’m just as much part of the problem as well.  Fuck me too.   because you are part of humanity.   Again, of course.   It may be tempting to see ourselves as separate from humanity and become judgmental towards our species   I guess.  I wouldn’t know, as I haven’t done it once.  I am exempt or worthy of nothing that all of us are not exempt or worthy of.   we're actually all part of the same human family and also share a responsibility towards the way we are behaving.   Of course.  Correct.  Everything I’ve said above still very much absolutely stands even under these considerations, however.   Holding contempt for humanity and having a judgmental attitude is non-productive and self-defeating   Calling a spade a spade is simply being matter of fact.  If we as a species are being more corrosive than helpful, and one doesn’t call that out, then that is simply denial, and one is being just as much part of the problem.   even though I have fallen for this trap myself as well sometimes so I can understand it.   It’s not a “trap” though to acknowledge when one is fucking up.  That’s not a trap at all.  That’s taking a step toward responsibility is what it is.   Accepting responsibility for the way things are without any judgment upon yourself or others is an important first step in my opinion   Accepting responsibility with or without being judgmental works for me.  Be as judgmental as you want, just make sure and accept responsibility and do what needs to get done to resolve the issue(s).  That’s how I feel about it anyway.   you need to 'forgive' in order to transcend the wheel of karma that locks us and the rest of humanity in its current state.   I would say action unlocks that wheel just as much if not more than forgiveness alone, however - independent of whether or not you call the transgressor a “piece of shit idiot” in the process.   Anyway peace and love to you   Peace and love to you as well.   I'm sure we all basically want the same thing.   If it’s a better, more responsible humanity and planet, then you would be correct.   I believe the Allies of Humanity briefings and the steps to knowledge as a spiritual guide both can be important tools for the people who feel drawn towards it.   I wouldn’t disagree with that.   we all share a common goal and I feel we often argue too much about small differences in opinion while the things we have in common are much greater and much more important to focus on.

aliens,3alvup,tweedius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, we’ve got fuck all claim to this planet.   We have more claim to this planet than certain alien groups who would like to take it from us. Of course, this does not mean that we have the right to rape and pillage this bountiful land. Humanity should act as wise stewards and, as much as possible, do what it can to restore the natural order that we have plundered.  We are like an indigenous tribe sitting on a land rich with gold or oil. Foreign powers, cunning and technologically advanced, are in our midst because they want what we have. If humanity is going to survive as a civilization, we need to ensure that the Earth remains under our stewardship. There's just no where else for our species to go.   Some of them have a greater claim to this planet than we do.   You are buying into their propaganda! They have as much claim over this planet as the British Empire had claim over half of the world when it colonized large chunks of it. Do not believe these lies.   The best thing humanity can do is develop is internal, spiritual, and psychic abilities.   I completely agree, and I thank you for mentioning that. In my personal life, I have been a Steps to Knowledge student for the past 4 years precisely because I believe our spiritual growth (which allows one to cultivate psychic abilities) individually and collectively is humanity's best and only hope. It is also our means of avoiding being manipulated by aliens who are powerful in the mental environment.   If certain ETs wanted to overtly take over the homo sapien race - and they were ALLOWED to - they would have already done so. No problem. The fact that there are shit ton of ET craft flying above and in the skies should be nothing to scare you. It just is what it is.   They are not taking over militarily because, as you mention, they are not allowed to. The Allies of Humanity explain that in this ""civilized"" region of space, such things are not permitted. If they tried, hundreds of worlds would band against them. Peace is guarded very carefully here. And yet, they are allowed to be here if it appears that the human race is acquiescent to their presence. They are taking over. They are simply doing it through covert and subtle means, the same way the CIA would do with a country it wants to control. It is far more insidious.   I don’t disagree with that, but what’s needed in order to protect yourself is a level of collective togetherness in this civilization that WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE by far.   Sustained contact with alien life is the greatest threshold a race can ever taken. We are entering a greater community of life in the universe. The shock of this is that not everyone out there is going to play nice. Defending our borders to space and maintaining our freedom and sovereignty amidst worlds that have their own designs on this planet is exactly what will drive humanity to end its ceaseless conflicts and cooperate together for a better, more stable, more peaceful, and more promising future.  This is a great challenge for our race, but also a great opportunity. That is why none of my words are tainted by fear. I simply recognize the magnitude of what we are facing and I am calling for human responsibility. We need to face the reality of our situation regarding alien life as it really is. If we can learn to do so, it will bring about the changes that both you and I want.  And it starts with you. And me. And the people reading this. That's why I have dedicated my life to my spiritual practice. I want to be a contributor in a world that is thirsty for giving."
aliens,3alvup,FeignedSanity,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:02:14 2015 UTC,"I   We have more claim to this planet than certain alien groups who would like to take it from us.   Possibly, but we certainly have fuck all claim to it compared to the alien group that likely made us, so there’s that.  Not only that, but even if a species is a native to an area, if that species is a destructive piece of shit and isn’t a good steward of the area they’re in, then I could see how they could get their “native” pass totally revoked.   Of course, this does not mean that we have the right to rape and pillage this bountiful land.   And yet this is either exactly what we do, or exactly what we let others do in our name.  We’re either guilty by direct action, or guilty by complicity.   Humanity should act as wise stewards and, as much as possible, do what it can to restore the natural order that we have plundered.   Correct and agreed, and I feel that until we do that, we have zero claim to this planet and deserve zero claim to it.   We are like an indigenous tribe sitting on a land rich with gold or oil.   No.  We’re like a marauding interloper who’s come in an killed the indigenous tribe originally here.   Foreign powers, cunning and technologically advanced, are in our midst because they want what we have.   You keep trying to or wanting to see this whole dynamic as some big threat, and this seems exceedingly imbalanced to me.  Perhaps you’ve watched “Independence Day” way too many times.  Intervention time.  Put the remote control down.   If humanity is going to survive as a civilization, we need to ensure that the Earth remains under our stewardship.   If humanity is going to survive as a civilization, it needs to ensure that it can responsibly handle its own growth independent of the land it’s in.  If it can’t handle its own issues, then it doesn’t matter if the human species is a “great steward”.  You’re putting the cart before the horse here.   There's just no where else for our species to go.   Extinct, perhaps.   You are buying into their propaganda!   What I’m buying into is this thing called HISTORY and archeological data that goes back thousands of years and further still.   They have as much claim over this planet as the British Empire had claim over half of the world when it colonized large chunks of it.   Realize what you’re talking about though.  You say “they” in such a general way that it’s like you’re referring to ”eeevery alien in the cosmos!”  Obviously a lot of species have even less claim to this planet than the human species itself does.  However, there are some species that likely DO have greater claim to it than humans do, and it is they that I’m referring to.  And as far as they are concerned, I would say they do have a better claim to this planet than humans.  Additionally, if a species came along that just got here for the first time ever (i.e. has no natural claim to it) but showed that it could be or was a much better steward of Gia than we are/have been, then it would seem to me that - if Gia herself had any say in the matter - they themselves would be the ones who stayed and we would (should) be the ones booted off the planet.   Do not believe these lies.   I try not to believe anything one way or the other.  I try not to work with belief at all.  I work with evidence, information, documentation, knowledge.   I believe our spiritual growth (which allows one to cultivate psychic abilities) individually and collectively is humanity's best and only hope.   Agreed - wholeheartedly - and until we as a whole and as a species can collectively raise our level of being in that area, we in my book will remain pretty unworthy stewards of this or any land.   It is also our means of avoiding being manipulated by aliens who are powerful in the mental environment.   This wouldn’t happen if we raise our SPIRITUAL and PSYCHIC abilities.  This is the key - not worrying about any sort of “guns and ammo” dynamic.   Steps to Knowledge   Will take a look through it.  Thanks for linking it.   They are not taking over militarily because, as you mention, they are not allowed to. The Allies of Humanity explain that in this ""civilized"" region of space, such things are not permitted.   Correct…to an extent (as there apparently are certain “rogue” types attempting to do what they want regardless), but correct enough.   If they tried, hundreds of worlds would band against them.   Seems correct enough as well.   Peace is guarded very carefully here.   The hold on it seems tenuous, but I would say that there are indeed powers that keep things from getting too out of hand.   And yet, they are allowed to be here if it appears that the human race is acquiescent to their presence.   Exactly.  Good point.  I think that there is a combination of what humans call “free will” going on in conjunction with the possible activity of one or more rogue species already on this planet.  When you combine these two factors, and you mix them in a planet with beings that are actually not that very evolved (i.e. humans), then you get a state where certain nefarious influences can enter and cause great possible harm upon that developing species.  It doesn’t help in the least either if that developing species is itself not very conscious and sufficiently evolved to do what is necessary ON ITS OWN to root out the problems existing within it and get rid of any infiltrating influences amongst its ranks.  I very much do think that the human race needs to very much protect itself.  With that we are in agreement.  However, it would seem we are not in agreement with regard to what kind of means are needed to achieve that protection.  I’m okay with every human on Earth being armed.  100%.  I’m all about the 2nd Amendment.  I also think that great amounts of meditation and critical self-reflection should be promoted more and more in this civilization.  However, and again, I am not in favor of having some stupid “star wars” attempt up in space - especially when (again) the beings that would be PUTTING the technology up there are some of the very ones we are trying to PROTECT OURSELVES FROM IN THE FIRST PLACE.  In other words, and to a large extent THEY’RE ALREADY HERE.  Who we are attempting to protect ourselves from have already infiltrated this civilization.  As such, what we need to do is raise our individual and collective level of awareness and wisdom so that we can unite and root out the negative influences from within our own society.  Physically, I don’t have a problem with every citizen being allowed to protect themselves and their families and loved ones domestically with arms, etc.  However, we have to work from within if we want REAL change globally and as a species."
aliens,3alvup,legitasl3alls,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"II   They are taking over. They are simply doing it through covert and subtle means, the same way the CIA would do with a country it wants to control.   Very correct and 100% agreed.  Heck, I don’t doubt for a moment that a good enough portion of them are in the CIA.   Sustained contact with alien life is the greatest threshold a race can ever taken.   It would seem.  I wouldn’t disagree with that.   We are entering a greater community of life in the universe.   It is just beginning, but there are still great forces with significant and vested interests in most definitely NOT letting that happen.   The shock of this is that not everyone out there is going to play nice.   Well, it will likely be a shock to some.  Definitely.  However, one just has to be intelligent and realize that just as all human beings are different - some are good, some are very not so good - non-human beings are no different either.   Defending our borders to space and maintaining our freedom and sovereignty amidst worlds that have their own designs on this planet is exactly what will drive humanity to end its ceaseless conflicts and cooperate together for a better, more stable, more peaceful, and more promising future.   Bullshit.  Don’t put one in front of the other.  Don’t put the cart before the horse.  We must come together internally FIRST, and then we will have what we need in order to do something similar to what you are talking about.  If we try to do something like what your’e talking about now, then what will happen is that, like I intimated above, the very beings that will be building this defense system will be the ones we will likely have to defend ourselves as a species against the most.  Realize that the beings that would be putting that system up around the Earth would be the very beings, powers, and influences that did 911.  It really is that simple.  911 was not any sort of terrorist attack that the US “had no idea was coming!”  It was a concerted, coordinated, EXTREMELY planned out attack from within the US that started being planned yyyeeeaaars ago and that used forces from the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia to accomplish.  So stop and think about that for a minute.  These are the beings that would be putting that “space age technology” up in the skies…”For our protection!!”  “Because freedom!!!” “Doing it for tha chilllldreeeennn!!” right?  Wrong.  We need to come together INTERNALLY and as a people first.  That is the ONLY way we will really be protected from any threats - externally or internally.   This is a great challenge for our race, but also a great opportunity.   Indeed it is - but it’s the points that I’m making that is the challenge that we should meet, not the ones that you’ve been talking about here.   I simply recognize the magnitude of what we are facing and I am calling for human responsibility.    No.  You don’t actually recognize the magnitude.  You don’t.  You don’t understand just how deep the problem and the threat really is.  Let me put it to you this way:  You’re essentially advocating putting a protective, bullet-proof suit of armor around a person so that they can be protected from attacks.  I’m saying the person has AIDS and that suit of armor is going to do all of shit because they’re gonna die anyway unless they REALLY get them some SEEERIOUS internal help.  You understand?   We need to face the reality of our situation regarding alien life as it really is.   Yes.  Most certainly.  I agree.  And I’m trying to help you understand how it really needs to be faced and what the real problems are.   If we can learn to do so, it will bring about the changes that both you and I want.   I agree, my man.  I agree.   And it starts with you. And me. And the people reading this.   Agreed.  100%.   That's why I have dedicated my life to my spiritual practice   LOL.  Jesus…So then WTF are you doing advocating some sort of external “global suit of armor” protection if you’re working so hard at the INTERNAL aspect of things as per the book you linked?  Come on, man!  It’s like you’re being given the keys to open the door, but you’re walking 100 years away from the house and sticking the key into a tree or some shit and trying to open it. lol  You seem to have all the puzzle pieces in front of you, but you’re putting them together wrong. lol  You seem to have a decent intention, and I don’t think we are all that far away from one another in our ultimate intent, but, as it seems to me, the things you’re thinking we need to do to help ourselves are most definitely NOT the things we need to do FIRST in order to really help.  Matter of fact, if we do what you’re suggesting in this OP first, we will truly retard our possible progress and cause a LOT more harm to ourselves than would otherwise be the case.  The key is to protect ourselves domestically as much as possible while growing and evolving internally FIRST.  THEN we can worry about and deal with protecting ourselves from what’s “out there”.   I want to be a contributor in a world that is thirsty for giving.   I don’t know if the world is that thirsty for giving.  It seems many of us humans might be thirsty for drinking even if we don’t actually know it, but it also seems that there are a lot of influences standing in the way of that for sure.  We just need to continue trying to be discerning and be critical thinkers about everything we do.  No ultimate harm meant in anything I’ve said here.  I wouldn’t we’re on opposing teams or anything.

aliens,3alvup,Goodhorsegonzo,4,Sun Jun 21 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"The Allies of Humanity offer us an interesting tidbit of information on this: they explain that in most civilized regions of space, there are agreements in place that prevent one world from conquering another world through military means. If an aggressive nation dares to do so, they are cut off from vital resources (embargoed) and opposed by hundreds of worlds. Few species could surmount this challenge. Competition for influence, resources, and worlds such as ours still takes place, but it is all done through far more subtle means.  Our world as a whole isn't quite there yet, but some areas of the world do behave in this more ""civilized"" fashion. For instance, if Sweden decided to invade Norway, the rest of Europe would band together to oppose it. It would just be unthinkable in this day and age. Europe, as a whole, can no longer fight amongst themselves. And yet, they still compete with each other for resources, spy on each other, etc. According to the Allies of Humanity, our galactic neighborhood works this way.  Food for thought."
aliens,3alvup,tweedius,3,Sun Jun 21 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"I have long thought that, although heavily opposed by many when proposed, a united world government is the clear progression for humanity. And if an intelligent alien species is openly discovered by humans and we all clearly know about it, maybe it will really kick start it?  The first priority is to stop all war between humans, then establish base human rights. Acceptance of the fact that all humans want to have shelter, food, water, company and some form of mental engagement and at least occasional entertainment. Everyone can agree, nobody wants to die, nobody wants to starve or to be tortured or even picked on, nobody wants to feel alone or secluded or hated or disliked. These things arise due to break downs in communication, the level of awareness and clarity between parties aren't on the same frequency and clash, sometimes horrifically.  Uniting all nations of the world under a true United Nations of Earth type deal, while allowing sovereign to keep the name and have federal governments to regulate interstate commerce and foreign affairs, with state/region and local governments governing smaller sections.  At the very least, with this new age of information and the internet we are on the verge of a new age of humanity, we need to start having open dialogue of what would actually be a good solution, forget trying to call it something like democracy or communism or socialism, the name does not matter; what it accomplishes is what matters. We are so close to being able to start mending some of the damage our species has caused this planet, the many species on it, and each other, we are going to have no excuse for it if we don't."

I just feel that if you're tackling this subject and receive money then thats great because the subject have a ongoing flow in the economic system.  Dr. Greer does not let us be left standing either in my opinion. He have apps made, he have had many meetings with very high up people according to himself and if he can keep doing that with the help of money then be my guest.  I am not going to be a observer to this subject whilst people from the inside of the UFO community bring it down because someone received more money than the other bloke.

Now Greer pushes for individuals to gain understanding, CE5, hosts meets , and meditations.

aliens,3ajftr,Sisko-ire,5,Mon Jun 22 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to answer this question for sure, but there are some plausible explanations.  They may be bound by some galactic law or agreement to not interfere.  We have free will on this planet and we are allowed to focus on doing human things to either evolve naturally or go extinct naturally.  They can likely travel through time so they can and probably have witnessed the results of interference and it might include people worshipping them and becoming dependent on them instead of being self sufficient.  Real communication can only occur when we approach from a common perspective.  Think about how much trouble we have communicating with other humans on Earth.  How many times on reddit do people completely dismiss the things we say about aliens because they don't have the background knowledge.  There are many examples of alledged ""messages to humanity"" that have a spiritual perspective.  Consider for a second that one of these messages is real.  There's no way to force someone to think this way and showing up and forcing us to recognize their existance might only hinder our understanding instead of letting us explore these ideas at our own pace through our own motivation.  Unfortunately it is also possible that they are staying hidden in order to manipulate us from the shadows.  Our economic system is a form of slavery where we need to participate in order to survive while most of the resources go to a select few.  No sane person on the planet wants to go to war yet we can't seem to break the pattern of killing each other.  What they want from us exactly is unclear but if this is the case it is not good for you and me."

aliens,3ajftr,zeuph,8,Sun Jun 21 10:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very big question and it is very hard to answer because we have not much information other than ""they're smarter than us"". We don't know if they have empathy, we don't know their moral or patience. Maybe 1mil years is a short time for them to investigate a planet. I'm not saying I believe this but I cannot even fathom how hard it would be to even try to answer this kind of question."
aliens,3ajftr,seanroecurran,4,Sat Jun 20 20:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, but we do have the grounds to ask this question, partly because our technology is advancing at an exponential pace."

aliens,3ajftr,Sisko-ire,3,Sat Jun 20 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"There is a very very interesting episode of Star Trek The next generation that deals with this. Its about an advanced space faring civilization (in this case, humanity) observing a less a advanced civilization and deciding if they should be informed about the reality of the universe or not. They have strict rules about first contact and monitor the planet very closely. One of the crew, who is disguised to look like them  gets captured and they find out he's an Alien. The response is one of great concern. ""Aliens are walking among us, spying on us, this must mean they are hostile"".  Eventually they beam up the world leader and tell him the truth. His response is very very interesting. I highly recommend watching it star trek fan or not.   Its called first contact (not the film) Season 4 episode 15.  I imagine if the galaxy is filled with advanced civilizations, it would make sense that they would probably have strict rules about first contact based on the level of development of the world in question.   edit  Found it on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwzYWdPQvXM"

aliens,3ajftr,ProtagonisticHero,0,Tue Jun 30 11:28:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  And if there are more advanced civilizations out there - we are a less advanced civilization to them.  Then it's likely there are less advanced civilizations than us out there.  If we were integrated into some galactic society, or given FTL/Warp drive capability, we'd be a threat to other younger civilizations. They want us quarantined to keep our nukes here on Earth.  At least until we grow up and learn to love and respect one another."
aliens,3ajftr,lickmybumbum,2,Tue Jun 30 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"There seems to be a ""galactic federation"" of some sort that has to abide to rules..one of it seems to be that they can't get directly involved with us on a large scale unless at least 50% of humanity want to have contact. Sounds weird, but that's what i've read on numerous reports from abductees."

aliens,3ajftr,xenopsych,2,Thu Jun 25 06:12:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that there are multiple alien species ""visiting"" the Earth. I think none of them have made contact for two reasons, primarily.  Firstly, we are not anywhere near united or cooperative as a species. Humanity's tribes are still fighting amongst themselves, as they always have. It's a messy situation for anyone desiring to make contact. Who are you going to make first contact with? The most powerful nation? A group of the world's powers? The UN? According to the Allies of Humanity, all space faring civilizations have united themselves (or at least found a way to cooperate globally). It is one of the requirements to be a space faring civilization. We're obviously not there yet.  The second reasons is that many of these groups are here for their own self-interest. Is this really surprising when humans are being abducted left and right? Is this at all shocking given our understanding of competition and nature? Staying discrete allows them to advance their aims with minimal opposition.   A better question to ask is: what exactly are these groups doing here? And: what should we do about it?  I support the Declaration of Human Sovereignty. Look it up!"
aliens,3ajftr,Jackariaonfire,2,Sun Jun 21 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"This is just a guess.  We know that they are in contact with multiple governments/ military groups/ organizations.  As for just dropping down and saying 'we're here' to the general public, I think they think that would literally cause people to freak out and cause chaos.  More or less I think they are waiting for us to visit them, like a public space flight to the moon with civilians, rather than them coming to us.   You gotta remember that there is a niche amount of people in the world that believe/ know they exist and for aliens to stop by and say 'hi' would destroy many worldviews of people.  That being said, humans are pretty tough. We have got through a lot of changes and I doubt some aliens would shake us up too much.   My guess to your question would be that slowly and surely we are going to have to meet them, the good ones and bad ones."

Given that they seem to have psychic abilities (wiping memories, controlling thought and emotion, projecting images)... contact is perhaps not the best idea, at least until you have similar abilities to defend yourself with."
aliens,3adnrb,zeuph,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:16:27 2015 UTC,"I don't subscribe to the theory that it's the only thing going on. I think there's an extreme amount of information that we dont know about. If there are ETs out there who I can make contact with, maybe I'll attract someone nice, or someone bad.  Also, if we're going to speculate about the greys then most of the ""scientific information"" we have from like Dr Jacobs or Dr Karla. Then we 'know' that these beings abduct certain people many times and having stuff that directly affects these people done to them(having weird childs etc). Then I believe it's safe to say that I am not one of these abductees and I probably wont be because if they wanted to abduct me then why isn't I abducted? So the greys are simply just doing their agenda and they're abductin people because of reasons they have, not because these are any human being. So I don't think that they would start abductin people left right and center just because they meditate etc.  That is why I don't worry about these nasty beings who could destroy my life. I'm sorry if this is a rant or badly written. I just woke up and my head is still spinning hehe.."
aliens,3adnrb,Miz4r_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:38:39 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your honesty in sharing your point of view. As a fellow human being, I am responding to your comment because I value your existence and potential contribution to our planet.  Contacting aliens is extremely dangerous, even if you do not end up being abducted (and if you did, you probably wouldn't even remember it.) You run the risk of being manipulated in the mental environment. Do you really want your thoughts tampered with?   Some alien forces may even turn you against your own humanity and enlist you in serving their own causes. You have witnessed this many times before. All those alien ""contactees"" who believe that aliens have the answer, that aliens are here to save us from ourselves, that aliens should be given free reign over our world, that human leadership and ownership of this planet is corrupt and hopeless and should be given away... these people have been tampered with. You run the risk of becoming another alien apologetic as our species embarks on the greatest threshold ever: sustained contact with alien life.  I personally would prefer you to remain a discerning, wise, cautious and inquisitive human being. This requires that your mind remain free. It necessitates you being able to think your own thoughts, as much as possible. Contacting aliens is not a good idea.  As your human brother, I hope that you will consider this path!"

However from my point of view it seems that every person in this world is painted with a color, depending on their personality. Maybe some people are blue(not necessarily political parties) some people are yellow, some people maybe try to be really flamboyant and they paint themself in pink or lime green. Most people just pick one of the major colors because you know what? If they are really popular then some of those really popular colors could/should be to some significant in my life. Some people lack colors. These peoples are drifters. They pick some color and changes quickly to other colors just to be inside some cirkle you know? Then they end up like me. The gray bitter one. The one who hasnt got a single spot on their clothes, skin, hair or any other spot. Just plain gray. No contrast at all. This is a choice for some and some happen to fall down a path not so filled with colors. Well for me, this is it. I cannot go forth without getting the answer to all this spiritual stuff you know. I'm not saying I will attract like a fucking magnet. I will just eeze into the subject and go from there. Not because I'm crazy and want to have fun. But because this is my path. I chose this and this is a point in my path that something big might happen. Either it be good or bad but none the less it needs to happen.  Maybe I will find my own color. Maybe I too can be happy.

Use of black and white (technology that is old by now - so must be by design) further hides things like a grey body suit over the mannequin (but couldn't hide the articulated knees, or the spade type hands - no fingers), in this low light environment and so one could not easily detect the color changes.  Movement - Wire or stop motion, hard to tell with the abysmal frame-rate.  I am leaning towards stop motion, as there seems to be a flash of light in one frame that is not there in the others, indicative of a passing of time between shots allowing a light artifact.

I imagine everyone whos on this subreddit is here because the very idea of humanity being in contact with an Alien race is a phenomenally fascinating idea and a profoundly important question. As there is no doubt that if such a thing ever happens or has happened already, then it is the most important event in the entire existence of our race.    The difference is some people are just happy to believe anything they read but the rest of us don't want fantasy or some persons misinterpretations or whatever. We just want the truth. And the only thing we can do is completely dissect every claim down to the tiniest details. This isnt about debunking, its just the simple fact that if someone IS telling the truth, then their answers to such questions will only prove they are. And bring everyone closer to the truth. This is a good thing. The OP took time and effort and thought long and hard about this because clearly just like everyone else, the OP is just as fascinated by the whole thing.   You just have to sherlock holmes this shit not because of negativity. But because ""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth!""  If the ""Fox"" is telling the truth, these are the kind of question he would 'want' to be asked. As it will help him further prove his claims of he can fill in holes that are easily poked in his story.

The 'aliens' behave too much like they would in a human's fantasy, like how they are their best friends and they do all kinds of neat stuff together. They flirt and the aliens get all shy and flustered around a human they like... sorry but I really doubt actual aliens behave like that. It also isn't consistent with other alien contact stories that do sound believable. My theory is that Fox201 is a tulpamancer, who is someone who creates beings out of their own consciousness who they can interact with. In other words, he and perhaps his wife too are creating their own imaginary friends. The mind is very powerful and can do this, it will seem 100% real to them."

aliens,3a0at3,zeuph,3,Tue Jun 16 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"We know very little of alien life, this is true. There are however many stories of people who have had contact with alien lifeforms and thus you can compare these stories to each other and find things that they have in common or not. I've read many of these stories and Fox201's story just doesn't feel like a genuine case to me. Maybe he just encountered a unique kind of alien species who think and behave like us in many ways, but in my opinion this is unlikely. You're free to have a different opinion, but I'm not going to waste my time on stories that seem like an obvious fake to me. I might change my opinion if others come out who have encountered the same kind of species and describe them the same way."

Under the paragraph ""let's assume.."" you question why they wouldn't just appear and be friendly. If I'm going to assume the same thing you did in that paragraph(that the story is not fabricated) I wouldn't go as far as to question their behaviour. This seems arrogant as to assume that we are the pinnacle of patience or moral code. What if their patience could stretch to an immense amount, then maybe 1000 years would be very short. Also, if it is the case that they're not here alone but a lot of species is and they're fairly new on the block then something like common rules made by one of the stronger races could be a possibility(Ex: Do not contact humans, they're our labrats).

I am convinced there are no valid evidence of that though.  Why do I automatically consider this story a fantasy? The same reason I would not consider a claim that earth is a few thousand years old, that a pink elephants lives in my closet, or that humans don't really need to eat or breath air to survive. Would you?    This story is equally ridiculous as any of those claims to me.  With obvious faults of logic and lack of knowledge and even very poor imagination and a social incompetence in not understanding how much smarter and more educated the average person is than the author to easily see its stupidity. Thats what it looks like to me.  Yes I consider my self more than qualified to judge this a fantasy! As much as I qualify my self to know what an apple is.   Even though there is a very slim chance everything I know is wrong and that everything every scientist has ever said is wrong I am biased to base my reasoning on it.

aliens,3a0at3,Rasta_Lance,-5,Tue Jun 16 14:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab and lets see what i get right or wrong:   ""They were there long before it was a nebula"" It being the crab nebula   no comment can't see the issue?   ""They have not ventured far beyond this local cluster of galaxies.""   there is probably a lot to do, and they probably don't have a pop Cap in the Multiples of Billions    ""They can travel to the nearest galaxy, Andromeda, in less than a half hour.""   Using the portals that were built ""years and years"" ago. one of which lands you at our moon, they didn't say how they did.   ""The tried a hybridization with humans but it never worked and always resulted in fetal death.""   I only found issue with this in the comment that they were ""millions"" of years ahead of humans, but then again that's a figure of speech and Fox could have asked the child who was also quoted as talking about ""blowing stuff up and modding weapons""    ""......these ones didn't know of our planet until about 1000 years ago.""   possible but unlikely - maybe they just didn't care to look in that time, more likely the comment avoiding the Pyramids is because the people that built the Pyramids are the people i met and they don't necessarily ""get a long."" or have the warmest of relations. (see crop image)     ""They found us by knowing other races that had done so. I have not been told who or what stumbled on earth first.""   can't see an issue or contradiction here?    ""They have complete knowledge of our history within the past 2000 years.""   they have access to the Group database, but maybe they only have their own records for the last 2000 years, maybe its a case of ""don't mention the war"" (faulty towers style)    ""human race is a hybrid of primates and another race that meddled with our genetics but were eventually discovered and punished""   yeah see here Fox and Z - http://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/39rrey/im_not_crazy_and_ive_had_contact_with_an_eti/cs82za3 I think it's important we get his one resolved.   ""We are extremely primitive to them (tens of millions of years behind)""   With lots of disclaimers, actually what we are as reputation is: violent, populous, and creative.     ""Through genetic modification they can live up to 3 millenia""   I don't contest this, but there are advantaged to recycling, just ask me and others.   ""Human genetics are extremely simplistic to them.""   sometimes the best things are the simplest, simple is efficient.    ""Genetic manipulation of primitive races is illegal under the laws that our galaxy abides by. ""   It probably is now however see my comment on that matter.   Damn just read the end of the OP post. really? The ""aliens are demons"" meme?"
aliens,3a0at3,_k_digi,0,Tue Jun 16 10:54:03 2015 UTC,Since you mentioned it who do you think built the pyrimids?
aliens,3a0at3,Rasta_Lance,-3,Tue Jun 16 06:59:46 2015 UTC,"Primarily the colonies that were here , but with help from other races, The guys i met, and the other guys, i don't know who else was involved but you have to remember they stood for a long time (functional) they were probably ""used"" by lots of people.   I don't think it is a coincidence that the ""Cap stone"" is missing and the guys i met where flying around in a pyramid that would fit on the ""cap Stone"" spot."
aliens,3a0at3,_k_digi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:55:57 2015 UTC,Do you think they are used to collect energy from Earth spinning and they could power ships or that it was a place of innatiation because I have seen a lot of people arguing this. I honestly can't say with 100% confidential what it's used for because I really don't know
aliens,3a0at3,dazegoby,-3,Tue Jun 16 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"I never ventured to find out - I always assumed a type of power station, and if the Ship sat atop perhaps it a ""refuel"" power station. not sure, i'm not in direct two way contact with all these races, although if i have questions i do get answers.   but I don't see a lot of these questions important, once you know as reality what you are and where we sit in the universe these things don't take a precedence, because once Earth is integrated ( i believe this is soon and obviously look around, look what's happening)     Basically at that time earth will get terminals to the Group database, this is like a VR database of info, T has been in it, I may have been to learn things (it hard to know for me because its not like T i didn't get to ""search"") if i was in there, it was just aspects shown to me. (you get to know the difference)   anyhow the point is you can look anything up including all of earth real history.  ** disclaimer i'd say you can't see things past your lvl of technological development.  ** The Pyramids would be fine to search."

aliens,39y10t,me_z,7,Mon Jun 15 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"Some great points there. I really think the subject has 4 kinds of personalities, those who know, those who believe, those who don't care and those who would not believe it even if a craft landed on the White House lawn.   What I like about this sub is people pretty much have an open mind here. Sure there are some crazy stories, but there is some great info too. I think the hardest part of the phenomenon is that even people who know, don't really know why. Our, if you will rational mind has trouble with these loose ends. It is hard to understand the motivations and intent of fellow humans let alone another species that could be 1000s of years ahead of us or even from a different dimension. At this point I feel like the best we can do is share our stories and hope to have some sort of comfort that we are not alone in this experience and not alone in the universe."

aliens,39y10t,Dibblerius,2,Tue Jun 16 06:18:10 2015 UTC,You deleted your comment? I was just typing a reply
aliens,39y10t,Dibblerius,5,Tue Jun 16 13:31:31 2015 UTC,"How do you know it's an experiment? Listen, I'm all for ETs and ET tech, but just random absurd  claims with no shred of evidence gets tiring. If it is a social experiment, I can't see any grand results by reposting the same ""experience"" every few months. The same questions almost always come up, but in the end all anyone really wants is proof.  My idea is it's just people getting a rise out of each other. Nothing can be done about that, except maybe a thread rule that states you can't post stories without some sort of proof. At least if there's something, it gives sub members a chance to dissect the claim and come to their own conclusion, I.e. the ""reveal"" of the alien that ended up being a mummy."
aliens,39y10t,Dibblerius,3,Mon Jun 15 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"Are you sure proof is what everyone wants?, or do you recon some might just want to believe?"
aliens,39y10t,Dibblerius,3,Mon Jun 15 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"As in having faith in something existing without knowing for sure?   I like to think science is based off of verifiable evidence, observation, known facts, research and collaboration. Belief, in this context, doesn't seem to really be a qualifier. People believed the Earth was flat hundreds of years ago.  However that was based off of just what people observed without observing the rest of the picture, or in this case, Earth.    I am all for speculation, but that's all it is. However when you have folks coming to say they've had contact with no shred of proof, it just becomes an exercise in creative writing. Lastly, no one is going to take this topic seriously until actual science is applied by mainstream scientists."
aliens,39y10t,yensushieee,3,Tue Jun 16 03:29:46 2015 UTC,"Well if you want my honest view, which is loudly unpopular in these types of communities, I think this topic is very much so being taken serious!   ""Mainstream"" scientists are concerned with it and real science is being applied!  It is just that everything points to aliens not visiting us, swishing about in the sky, abducting people, or being hidden by governments. Not a single piece of compelling evidence or even un-proven indications or theories with any reasonable plausibility points to anything of that kind going on.   That is not what an ignorant and un-interested mass conclude, but is what a very concerned and educated population of people in the fields of space-exploration, astrophysics, and specifically dedicated search for extra terrestrial intelligence ( SETI ), amongst many others AND also what the mostly interested common man conclude.   What you are left with are unverified stories of self-claimed witnesses ( of whom there are as many sure they have spoken to god, seen ghosts, and any kind of wild claims ), falsely conclusions from lacking knowledge or methods from wrongly interpreted mysteries and even of things that are not mysteries but fully understood and proven in other ways but of such ignored as in the case of ancient astronaut theories, and spiritualistic convictions.   So what I am suggesting, or were suggesting in my question, is that maybe it isn't proof that everyone is looking for, but to believe and hang on to all that says yes to something they really want to be true.   Proof is so far suggesting NO!, they are not here and have not been here in recent enough history to leave traces. Alternatively they are so vastly unrecognisable and traceless it is beyond our best efforts to ever know it.   ( look through this sub and count all the times you read ""I really want..."" or ""it is my lifelong dream..."", and let that suggest to you how much strict rationality is behind reason here )   On a side note I would like to correct you on when people thought the earth was flat. 100 years ago every person in the civilised world knew it was round, in fact Magellan and Columbus were dead sure when they made their journeys and maps. Even in the dark ages when the church in Europe adopted the flat earth model most people did not really believe it, earlier civilisations had already proven otherwise. The ancient greeks for one.    I get and agree with the point you were trying to make with it though.  Edit:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth"
aliens,39y10t,Hat3d1312,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your insights.  As far as flat Earth goes, and we are just being pedantic here:   The flat Earth model is an archaic concept of the Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period, India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD) and China until the 17th century. That paradigm was also typically held in the aboriginal cultures of the Americas, and the notion of a flat Earth domed by the firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl is common in pre-scientific societies   source: ""Their cosmography as far as we know anything about it was practically of one type up til the time of the white man's arrival upon the scene. That of the Borneo Dayaks may furnish us with some idea of it. 'They consider the Earth to be a flat surface, whilst the heavens are a dome, a kind of glass shade which covers the Earth and comes in contact with it at the horizon.'"" Lucien Levy-Bruhl, Primitive Mentality (repr. Boston: Beacon, 1966) 353; ""The usual primitive conception of the world's form ... [is] flat and round below and surmounted above by a solid firmament in the shape of an inverted bowl."" H. B. Alexander, The Mythology of All Races 10: North American (repr. New York: Cooper Square, 1964) 249."

aliens,39y10t,dazegoby,2,Tue Jun 16 13:20:13 2015 UTC,"Few good points but some aren't for instance, you pointed out about how cures shouldn't be given out because we weren't learned anything from it. So we should let billions of people die? Of all those billions of people dying, wouldn't you think each individual had a place/mission on earth but had their life shorten due to unforeseen health problems? I suffer and along with billions of others. To say that cure's shouldn't be given because we won't learn anything is selfish and a lack of spiritual love. If you were suffering with liver problems (can't eat meat due to high iron), kidney (stones that will burn your dick when you piss), intestines (you have a plastic bag thats connected to your anus 24/7 because your shit comes out every 20 minutes), and pain,and there was a cure from aliens but some dumb prick decided that if you are cured, you won't learn anything, wouldn't your quality of life be shit? How would that person contribute to society if he's just draining government/tax payers money? If you had these illness and were cured, wouldn't you be MORE useful in a cure stated versue sick? Next thing is comparing a child's mind to human motivation for discovering. When you have a child, that child is dependent on the parent. Spoiling them and giving them what they want is something up to the decisions of the parents meaning it's the parents lack of teaching, not the child. If aliens gave us cures and some advancement to technology and are given to the right hands of the government, not only are they solving world problems but they are also inspiring and motivating billions of other people to become more loving because the condition for loving will be greater. Your only good points are how to debunk people, which usually means your knowledge of life is beyond measureable."
aliens,39y10t,SixtiesRevival,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:04:50 2015 UTC,"you pointed out about how cures shouldn't be given out because we weren't learned anything from it. So we should let billions of people die?   I honestly thought about that while writing this thread, but left it out because of how far down the rabbit hole I was really willing to go.    I mean this in the least offensive way possible, but people die and are in pain all the time.  That is pretty cruel, but it is what it is. Giving humans the cure to all diseases does not 'cure' that.  We just flat out kill each other.  Besides that, just because you love people unconditionally, doesn't mean anyone else will.  In fact, they might think you're crazy and possibly even crucify you (i.e. Christ).  I don't know you, and you don't know me.  That seems to be a majority of people's thought process instead of just getting along with each other and working towards a common interest: a peaceful advancement in humanity.  People would MUCH rather work 9-5 in an air conditioned office than go plow a field somewhere and tend to their chickens because money was outlawed because it insights greed and individualism.  Until the day where humanity makes a conscious, and subconscious, effort to move forward without daytime TV, McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Lockheed Martin, the NYSE, and Disney World, we will always be here in the same place, having the same conversation.   Next thing is comparing a child's mind to human motivation for discovering. When you have a child, that child is dependent on the parent. Spoiling them and giving them what they want is something up to the decisions of the parents meaning it's the parents lack of teaching, not the child. If aliens gave us cures and some advancement to technology and are given to the right hands of the government, not only are they solving world problems but they are also inspiring and motivating billions of other people to become more loving because the condition for loving will be greater.   Comparing these actions to raising a child is what it is.  It's about learning to appreciate and give value to something.  I never said it was the fault of the child, I was basically saying that it misguides the child.  Edit:  I forgot to address your other issue you had with my statement."

Sightings will continue to slowly become more and more common but it will be less and less mocked by the media\politicians and things like receiving radio signals from space and lights on other celestial bodies will be more common and not dismissed so lightly as random unimportant events.   Political figures and religious figures will eventually let it be known that it's possible we are not alone etc until the majority of the public has been sufficiently softened up enough to the point that they can accept what is being fed to them without blowing a gasket.   The story that is presented though, is where the real shit comes in. One possible scenario could be 'we know about them and they are friendly'. The downside to this is, the powers that be have a very real chance of losing a grip on society and people that they have currently. The upside is I personally feel it would be a MASSIVE step in the right direction.  Saying they are potentially dangerous or have some kind of negative agenda for earth would immediately solidify control over the populace and unify everyone against a common enemy. One one hand unifying the nation's of the world would be a nice thing, but doing so based on a lie that could very well get us killed because someone wants to remain at the wheel is both ridiculous and sadly the more probable outcome."

I do think its coming soon...idk tho the have covered it up this long but seems UFO sightings are at a all time high...and also noticed that tv is showing alot of alien movies as well...also the end of days movies but noticed this the last couple months.
aliens,39p7m0,HPDave,9,Sat Jun 13 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"This has been covered extensively on Ancient Aliens. So I won't elaborate any more on that as you should just check that series out and it will answer your questions.  On the other hand what I will do is hit you with my own theory;      We know that there are several different types of aliens(reptilians, small/big grey) and within that we can speculate that the small greys are helpful, atleast for the purpose of this theory. Now if you look into UFO sightings they appeared quite a bit more frequently around the early 50s(or you could say shortly after WW2) and again around missile silos in the Cold War. So what I think is that the small greys are actually us from the future and what we know as a UFO can not only transcend space but also Time.     I think that the small greys are here because at some point humanity fucked up and had to start a cloning program for survival and after a few centuries of this no longer have any decent original DNA to go off of. So they came back to stop it, and probably succeeded, but of course this chances the course of their timeline, although that was their intention, but we of course don't understand time travel and it's possible the small greys don't either. So after saying all of this we are left with two possibilities.     Either they can not go back to their time and are stuck here because after changing their past there's no future for them to go back to, OR(and this is the one I like better) they went back and everything was still the same, essentially humans fucked ourselves over again and the greys need to keep coming back to find out what eventually causes the cloning program to start again and this create the problem   Sorry if that's a little long winded, just a theory I've been working on for a while that I thought you and others may find interesting"

It's also amazing since there's so many religions that have their roots designed around beings from the sky. What if all religions stories are true? Just each culture and group of people interpreted them differently?
aliens,39p7m0,emmapaterakis,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:23:55 2015 UTC,Read this.  It talks about the significant amount of documentation existing that points directly toward the very thing you're talking about.
aliens,39p7m0,no1113,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of interesting info about our creation in this supposed interview with a reptilian female http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_52.htm  an excerpt:   Your race was genetically engineered by aliens and we were just the more or less passive visitors of this accelerated evolution process. You must know (some of your scientists have already supposed this) that your species had evolved in a naturally completely impossible speed within just 2-3 millions of years. This is absolutely impossible, because evolution is a much slower process if it’s natural but you have not understood this."
aliens,39p7m0,Formaggio_svizzero,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"I've heard from Tom Horn that in the Bible, it said that Noah received ""seeds from each species on the planet"". Which could have an impact on this theory.  I believe that most religions are accurate to some extent. Many cultures and religions talk about similar stories and beings. Gods being of flesh and skin. Giants walking the earth seen in many different cultures. I believe that our past was very crazy compared to now, a more of a ""play state"" of a civilization. It didn't matter back then if someone/something interfered with us on this planet because we were not evolved enough(technologicaly) to be relevant for their agendas. However for the past 100-150 years we went from having only horses and carts up to creating airplanes, using oil to create massive industries, robots, missiles, rockets and atomic weapons.  If there's species out there that's even the slightly interested in keeping their future intact they sure would be interest about what's going on here. If it took us 100 years to go from carts to mars and extremely powerful bombs. Then who knows what the next 100 years looks like? 100 years is extremely short time in universal scale and looking at our history, we usually shoot first and ask questions later. So when a civilization makes this jump, other species makes sure they wont get an atomic space-missile in their ass out of nowhere. Maybe it doesnt hurt them as much as it hurts us when we shoot ourselfs. But I believe that they're interested in a species which looks like they're weaponizing space rather than welcoming it with peace."

Be mindful and sceptical when watching Ancient Aliens or reading up on Ancient Astronaut Theories as they are infamous for making mysteries where none are.   Claiming a lot of things to be un-explainable where geologists, engineers, historians, and physicists know perfectly well how to explain it. Pyramids, rock formations, the meaning of mysterious paintings etc...   There are quite a few exceptions of true mysteries but it nags at the overall credibility of these people. Also keep in mind that their original inspiration and founders are blunt science fiction authors.   Have fun enjoy the show, I love it!"
aliens,39kuvb,trevordunt39,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"Have not read a book of him. I just know that he is one of  the classical highly controversial contactees of the 1950 - 1960 period (Fry,Adamski,Huntingon, Angelucci etc.). But Menger himself recanted at some point his story publicly in a radio show (also about the alleged ""Venusian"" friend)  However what i find interesting is that Ivan Sanderson lived in the same area as Menger. I think they were even friends or at least Sanderson spoke/interviewed him several times. Sanderson wrote in one of his books that something odd seemed indeed happen to Menger during these years. But Sanderson as a fortean did not jump on the contactee theory bandwagon -- he was more like John Keel (no wonder; they were friends too). But if Sanderson had the impression something odd happened to Menger, we can assume that something was going on (not necessarly real contact) --- because Sanderson was a real scientist, he knew his stuff. Some things pointed to the direction that Menger was misused by some ""army/secret service program"" -- at least i think that was the direction Sanderson thought.  I cant remember where i've read it. Either in Sandersons ""Things"" , ""More Things"" or in Keels ""Operation Trojan Horse""."

He talks like NASA are just amateurs yet NASA have some of the most intelligent people working for their organisation. The people that join the military/NAVY don't have the best reputation of being the smartest people yet they can out smart people in NASA? And yes i know the military can hire smart scientists, but at the end of the day they are just as human as the people working at NASA. So if the technology really existed then im sure other people would have figured it out by now. History has shown that when it comes to techonology, that there has always been a break through by different people around the same time. Perfect example is the first computer. There is still debate who actually invented the first computer as the creators kept it a secret. But the fact is, the different parties involved had no idea that there were people on the other side of the world who were also inventing something similar. The main point is, if the military can create advanced technology, so can NASA and other organisations."

It may not necessarily come down to some group being smarter / more skilled than another, but which group benefits from more favorable resource allocation. IF there is a secret space program it likely gets TONS of black budget money, while NASA is on a much tighter budget. Also, being out of the public eye, they can get away with some less-than-morally-awesome experimental work such as human trials and employing people of dubious affiliation...I'm thinking along the lines of us employing Nazi tech wizards after WWII, for example. Technology grows exponentially and if you're allowed a budget in the trillions (maybe) with no real regulation or oversight then you might be able to move at a much quicker pace than more publicly visible entities or private enterprise (here I mean private in terms of business, not secret). So the SSP boys and girls aren't necessarily smarter, they've just had the means to build and amass bigger and better toys to play with. Also, having such resources and freedom might allow your secret space program to ""draft"" certain people from certain fields, thereby, in a way, making you a bit ""smarter"" indeed. Also, also a secret space program might have existed long before NASA giving them a head start. Maybe NASA was created to divert attention from it. If we have a publicly visible space program why would people bother trying to uncover whether we have a space program? Now THAT'S a load of speculation, of course!"

So conparing all the stories they all have a lot of similarities. That ""God"" or ""aliens"" saved Noah and his family and 2 of each animals on Earth because the human race fucked up. Theres a few possible reasons why.   One thoery is that our DNA was tainted through breeding with alien races that would come to Earth and if somethig wasnt done we would become extinct due to being infertile.   Another idea is that we became so advanced at an alarming rate after breeding with aliens that they wiped most of us out and started again kind of like their pet project. There had to have been advanced technology way back in ancient times. Some of the structures would be near impossible to create even with the technology we have now. We had help for sure."

It's rotation around it's axis is at about the same speed that it takes to orbit the earth.  It actually speeds up and slows down as it's orbit is slightly oval, and that allows us to see about 59% of the surface, from Earth.

aliens,39afmm,Miz4r_,7,Wed Jun 10 14:50:42 2015 UTC,I think we're being warned against ourselves. To not trust those who promise us nice things and manipulate us through the media. Could be that some alien types are involved as well but that's pure speculation.
aliens,39afmm,anti_h3ro,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:14:58 2015 UTC,I interpreted the message the same as you. The deception coming from our own ranks of society and from those who are in power and have control. Funny how they'd lose that control once the masses woke up and found out there was more intelligent and powerful life elsewhere. Maybe that's why the whole issue of ET contact is ridiculed by many in power.
aliens,39afmm,Miz4r_,2,Sun Jun 14 02:49:56 2015 UTC,"Sadly everything that falls outside the currently accepted paradigm is always met with ridicule and heavy skepticism. Skepticism is needed of course, but we need an open minded and proactive form of skepticism not a closed minded and lazy one where people just refuse to believe anything but they lack common sense and don't actually investigate or read properly into the matter themselves. They're the opposite of the 'I want to believe' types of people who entangle themselves deeply into a web of conspiracies and lies. A middle road between these two needs to be taken.  The question is though whether we really want the reality of the ET visitations to be widely known and acknowledged. On the one hand it would be good to wake up the masses, but on the other hand I truly wonder whether humanity in its current state will be able to respond to this in a responsible manner or will the ones in power simply spin the ET reality to their own advantage and make them into enemies we must defend against? I'm afraid humanity is still too immature and primitive as a collective to be able to handle this truth well. That's why I believe we first need to grow up and learn how to stop fighting each other and change our systems of power and control before we actually confront this ET reality. I think we should start with a complete reform of our monetary system, because it's this system that lies at the root of many of our problems. The way money is currently being created as debt and distributed is completely insane. People need to start to educate themselves and others about this and how this is trapping ourselves into a system of slavery and control, where we destroy the planet in the process. Just telling people there are aliens here visiting our planet will not solve our earthly problems."

They don't need to get out of their ship,  its huge for complex designs,  and the fields typically are in a place where the act of making the circle cant be seen.   Plus,  a farmers field will be seen.  Period.  Any other communication,  short of showing up and saying ""sup"",  would be much less visible.    I'm just shocked at the depth someone would have had to go into to fake this.  Like they replied almost identically to what sagan put out there.

Probes/observers are government controlled, while our message was picked up by some scientists, who responded the way they could.  Perhaps they are incapable of any other means. Maybe they lack the organs to speak, or the medium to portray a message that would be seen by many. Influencing plants to show an image from the perspective of above could be the easiest way for them to project what they desire to share.  Similarly, maybe the distance is just too vast for them, and it was the simplest and quickest way to send a message in return. Maybe the technology used isn't exactly its intended purpose, but it could be done, and thus it was done.

If there's one thing I think Hollywood does correct, it's refraining from telling the public about massive discoveries like aliens in the movies.  They always wait on it, or hide it for a time, because people really are not ready for things like that.  Do I believe in aliens?  Absolutely.  But I don't think they're visiting us, and each and every single ""UFO"" claimed to be seen by people might be ""unknown"" to them, but is not alien in origin.     Wouldn't they have easily figured out it was there own signal due to information sharing from departments things of that nature?   You have apparently never worked for any of the world's major governments ;-)  Jokes aside, it's usually pretty easy to determine if a signal is coming from a local source or not.  What I said, however, wasn't in reference to local emissions, but rather things like GRBs, coronal ejections from stars, jets from black holes, etc.  Sometimes we ""hear"" these, and think ""yay, someone's trying to contact us!"", when in reality it's just light and radiation traveling through space.  Yes, it looks mathematical on paper (and often exhibits patterns), but that doesn't imply alien intelligence.  Mathematics, after all, describe the universe around us, sentient or not."

They can not send a broader message as this breaches protocol. If a broad TV broadcast was conducted the moment it finished the people that control human information would say it was a hoax or even say they did it as a test, everyone would believe that. That would potentially alarm and ""cause harm"" to the primitive planet. (earth)  Based on what we have sent out they can respond to us under protocol, I'm sure there are a few more cards up there, these guys are smart, they know all the political aspects related to where the earth is now the bilateral contract etc.   However this doesn't mean we have a ""savour"" the message seems to be:  "" if you can save yourself you can be saved.

If this information controlled environment did not exist, energy and resources would be allocated to investigate the process and system by which the images occur.  Instead this does not happen because human ""science"" does not function in or to the benefits of human society.

A lot of military are developing now our own flying saucers which are very similar to extra terrestrial ones but not as high functioning. It's very possible it was an Alien craft but can't be certain.  Cool story though, best thing is to keep an open mind. I've seen maybe 3 in my life time.   From the info you are giving I would say you saw something quite secretive, I am envious of you and wish I saw it myself too.  All we can do it hope that in our lifetime these questions are answered and we can finally know the truth of what has been really going on, on this planet all these years.  However if you want definite proof Aliens do exist here are some interesting documents released by the FBI near Roswell times.  http://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%201%20of%2016/view  Go to page 22 but there are 16 documents in total very interesting read.  These are on the FBI website they were forced to release them.   It talks about what landed on earth at Roswell and what followed after, these are extremely old documents (1947).

I live near several military bases so the idea that it was some black project is plausible. I just wasn't sure of what type of craft it could really be, or if anyone was familiar with something similar to it. It's peculiar that my boyfriend and I saw two completely different things... That part is the most frustrating for me. I can explain what I saw in great detail, and he can too. The best explanation for what he saw is if you Google the words ""ufo triangle."" Exact description of what he saw.   The whole thing was strange and I don't have answers, and I didn't expect anyone to. I just also wanted to put it out there because it's been eating away at me ever since. I've heard about the FBI documents... Maybe it's about time I read them."
aliens,39dgpo,Swag3000,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that you saw two completely different things can depend on a lot of things. UFO's create their own gravity most of the time and can warp perception from even slightly different angles but another more spiritual answer would be.  A lot of these craft are what we call ethereal and can change due to someones perception.  Our brains a very advanced things which are not used to their full potential all people are different and some more in tune than others.  It's very possible you saw different things because you are on two different wavelengths of existance as is everything.  All animals can feel energy, just as we can. Ever notice a cat or dog can almost know what is about to happen next or can read your emotions without saying anything.   I might sound crazy but it's possible that you both saw things differently because of that, strangely enough when I saw UFO's for the last time right before one ""took off"" I had an immense feeling of dizziness I almost fell over.   However my girlfriend saw it goes as fast as a shooting star but then disappear off into space. I however did not see that even though we were looking at the same spot.  But as I mentioned I was severely dizzy for several seconds I almost fell over on the concrete.

He's much more in tune with aliens and whatnot than I am. He does all of the research and then teaches me, basically, so it would make sense that he'd see something more than I would.

I believe it to be a combination of brain activation and genetics. Some people are born with better vision things of that nature. Some people can therefore sense and be more in tune naturally.   Though the fact your boyfriend is into Aliens a lot can put in the fact that he has been possibly abducted at some stage or another. I am not trying to boast myself or anything like that but, all my life I can remember being completely fascinated with aliens.  I was 8 or 9 years old borrowing books from my school library about abductions and it had very detailed drawings and spooked the shit out of me. People who are genuinely curious or seeking answers can be a sign to people who have been abducted because they are subconsciously worried, depressed, want answers etc.  I have always been scared of them absolutely terrified of those massive black eyes. I am 23 years old and still afraid every night of them.   Does this mean anything I don't know but is your boyfriend the same?? Has he always been fascinated or scared of them even since little??

In the past, I categorized much of the reported phenomena as being some manifestation of our consciousness/subconsciousness reflected back to ourselves. This is why it's so nebulous and difficult to interpret... just as dreams are.  But after some recent activities where I witness physical phenomena that was clearly real... and witnessed by other people with me, and all witnessed in the same way, I have become more certain that there is absolutely a component that involves Different ET Races. Since I believe it is a dimensional thing and perceiving other dimensions requires heightened senses, some people will see nothing, some people will see more.   So, I go with a combination of three things: Different ET Races, our Consciousness/Subconsciouness, and Gaia... all working in conjunction.  Schrodinger said, ""The total number of minds in the universe is one."" In other words, when we refer to ""consciousness"" we are talking about universal consciousness."

aliens,38wwhx,ihatejeeps,4,Sun Jun 7 15:06:56 2015 UTC,"I've read some really interesting accounts of the Biblical ""Nephlim"" being regarded as ""Aliens"" in our society. In the old testament these beings, or fallen angels, were, when banished to Earth, able to impregnate human women. Eventually these breeding habits created a super race of humans, referred to in the Bible a few different times. In Genesis 6:4 it says ""The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown."" And then again in the old testament when Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt and into the promise land, the scouting party sent into the promise land returned, saying, ""... and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. 33And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."" (Numbers). If you've ever heard about David and Goliath, you'll notice that Goliath was around 9-10 feet tall. He probably would have weighed around 600+ hundred pounds of muscle.   So, why bring all this up? Some people believe that these Nephlim were a very influential force on this world, and that they are still at work in ways we don't understand. Some believe they are still trying to return and rise back to power again. Unfortunately the genuine reports and legitimate research on a bizarre topic like this is very scarce, and you have to be incredibly skeptical at every turn. So, maybe you're part Nephlim."

Some iterations of the encounter say that the bottom half of it was some sort of hovering machine or craft. That parts kind of sketchy though, because I've only heard that from one written retelling of the story, and once from one of those sensationalist mysterious encounters shows. Every other time I've heard it was a metallic gown/robe. Either way it suggests an intelligence beyond most cryptids.  Mothman I definitely associate more with cryptozoology/paranormal phenomena rather than alien.

Now there's another type of cryptid creature called the Dover Demon that was spotted 3 times within 24 hours in Dover Massachusetts in the late 70s and hasn't been officially spotted since. The creature kinda looks like a grey but there wasn't any reported UFO activity around the time it was spotted.

aliens,38lqyd,Swag3000,4,Fri Jun 5 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"Frightening! I believe what happened to you in your bed was a manifestation of residual trauma associated with abduction. From what I've researched, ET's don't typically fumble around under sheets to grab you, rather, they phase you through the wall, or levitate you with the stereotypical blue-white ""cone"" of light beaming from their crafts. They tend to use something akin to a hypnotic, telepathic (or technological) ""pulse"" or ""frequency"" to keep their subjects calm, disoriented, or asleep. More often than not, when an abductee is returned, he/she will have little to no recollection of what transpired. They don't remember ""dreaming"" whatsoever, or they recall ""false"" memories of what ACTUALLY happened (like dreams about owls, or other big eyed creatures staring at them, uncomfortably close.) However, since you were relatively cognitive while experiencing the sensation of being dragged out of your bed, it may be your brain condensing all of the stimuli  it received during your abduction, and ""recalling"" it as a single, dreamlike moment. If it's any consolation, myself, many MANY redditors (mostly lurkers we'll never hear from) and a HUGE chunk of the human population have been subject to abductions. Some UFOlogists claim EVERYONE has been abducted at one point or another. I don't think we'll learn the truth in our lifetime, but at least, if it WAS an abduction, they put you back  Before you go to bed next, do a ""sweep"" over your body, whether through meditation or physically taking stock of your health, and check your results against the condition of your body once you wake up the next morning. Take note of strange marks (Bruises, abrasions, burns, ""scoop marks"" or cuts. It's easy to overlook them because they don't typically hurt, so inspect closely) or sensations (Things like groundless anxiety or localized pain near implant points [behind the eye, at the base of the thumb, the lower mandible, bicep, ect]) which may seem out of the ordinary. You will be able to research these marks and sensations with other resources, and it could help you get closer to understanding what is happening to you.  As for your vision, take heart. My own belief is one of two things happened: you were contacted by an intelligent, conscious entity. Whether it's extra dimensional or extra terrestrial you'll probably never know (unless, of course, you ask it directly the next time you see it). OR it was an aspect of your Self described in many MANY occult texts as an egregore. An egregore is a ""thought form"" similar to the buddhist concept of ""tulpa"" yet lacking its own consciousness (as it only exists as long as the creator of the egragore exists) This one in particular seems like a manifested aspect of all the bits of yourself that has been kicked around and denied love. Because it looked so similar to yourself, and it was staring at you so intently (to me it seems to be imploring you to acknowledge it) leads me to believe that it is some forsaken part of you, perhaps an inner ""feral"" child, your ""shadow self,"" or all the pain, abandonment, and anger you've carried since your conception. My suggestion would be to meditate again (I'm 23 as well and have experienced similar visions; the doppelganger with the wide lidless eyes...I know, it's fucking scary, but you shouldn't be afraid. If you go into it Knowing ((with a capital K)) you're safe, you'll be safe.) and try to ""call up"" the being in the vision you had. Converse with it at your discretion. Ask it what it wants, give it a hug, or tell it to go the fuck away. Either way, I'm sure you'll get results. With luck, you'll come out of your meditations with a little more knowledge about yourself and/or the being that's making contact.  God speed! I'd be happy to answer any questions you have, and I encourage you to post any new developments which may occur once you decide how to approach this."

aliens,38jur7,lobob123,-5,Sat Jun 6 07:39:40 2015 UTC,That doesn't de-validate the experience at all. Have you ever taken psychedelics? They heighten your awareness.
aliens,38jur7,hashmon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"I have taken psychedelics, and you're right, they do heighten your awareness. But not in the superhero, ""perceiving on other planes"" sort of way.  LSD doesn't give you the ability to see things that aren't there. Some people made need them to give themselves a more open mind to be able to accept things or see them in a different light, but the fact remains that anything that is seen under the influence of psychedelics can be perceived without them.  So, in situations like OP's, all it does is skew your judgement. If you see a unicorn fly over head while high, that doesn't mean they exist.  I'd like to hear a story like this from someone who hasn't tainted their judgement with drugs."
aliens,38jur7,ImJustSadSorry,-1,Fri Jun 5 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"I just disagree from extremely extensive experience that psychedelics taint one's judgment. I find that stimulants and alcohol taint people's judgment, and psychedelics help us see things more clearly. You're never going to find people not on ""drugs,"" since our entire society is on drugs. And personally, the profound paranormal experiences that I've had have been under the influence of DMT, a tryptamine psychedelic that hurls you into another dimension. Far from meaningless hallucination, I've found these experiences to be the most meaningful and ""real"" of my entire life.  You're certainly entitled to your opinion, though."
aliens,38jur7,hashmon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a very broad, generic sense our entire society is on drugs, but that isn't the same thing.  Psychedelics don't take you anywhere. They just make it feel like they do. That's why they're so great. While those experiences may be very meaningful for you, they are only ""real"" in the sense of personal experience. That is to say, they are real because you had them, but they don't show you any kind of objective reality.  You just can't trust the judgement of someone with an LSD experience over one with a sober mind. Again, if you see a flying unicorn when high, do you now continue to believe that flying unicorns exist?  Or to use a parallel, more relevant example: if an alien approaches you only while high, or you see/find a portal to another world, how do you just accept that as a reality? Your mind is clouded and experiencing things on a much more heightened level. This is going to easily convince you of things that aren't real."
aliens,38jur7,ImJustSadSorry,2,Fri Jun 5 17:43:30 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion/assumption that psychedelics don't show an ""objective reality."" You've probably never smoked DMT. I've had the chance to a lot; it certainly shows us an entirely different reality. And people have very similar, and transdimensional, experiences with it. There are countless stories of these experiences. ""DMT: The Spirit Molecule"" is a good movie that documents a lot of these; it's really worth watching (on youtube). The experience on DMT and especially ayahuasca is anything but cloudy; it's the clearest thing ever, and also profoundly meaningful beyond words, and it involves an interaction with another intelligence. I've had this experience, and so have countless thousands of other person. I'd say psilocybin mushrooms, especially at higher doses, can also bring us to a profound and very real place that's outside the norm of materialist assumptions.   With LSD I'd say not quite so much, but ""cloudy"" would certainly be one of the last words I'd use to describe the experience, and we'll have to agree to disagree that you necessarily can't trust the judgment of someone on LSD. SOMETIMES a person does really lose it; I've seen it happen. But I've tripped well over 100 times, and I've been around a lot more than that with other people tripping, and with rare exception I find it a very lucid state."

aliens,38e34z,brettievedder,10,Wed Jun 3 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"10 years ago...It was a warm summer evening in Northern California. Back then I had to get up at 4:30 every morning for work, so I was starting to settle in for the night. It was about 9pm, just barely getting dark, I was sitting on my bed, reading. My bedroom was on the second floor of a townhouse. I had the window open, with the blinds closed. I was enjoying the quiet, no radio or TV on. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a small, reddish orb come through the open window. At first I thought it was a laser pointer, someone playing a prank. But then it traversed the room silently, in a way that was physically impossible for a laser. My heart felt like it stopped, and I was terrified. It seemed intelligent, scanning the room, like it didn't know I was there. I felt like I couldn't breathe, completely frozen in terror. I can't remember if I screamed, or made a pathetic attempt at a scream, but it realized I was in the room. It darted out the window. As it went out the window, the blinds slammed into the glass. There wasn't even a slight breeze that night. After a few minutes of being frozen out of fear, I called my boyfriend. He got to my place fast. We took a flashlight outside, and couldn't find any evidence(footprints, ie.). He checked again at daylight. Nothing unusual, at all. That's my story. That's all I know. I discussed this with a well known ufo researcher, and I was told that these type of encounters do happen. What it was, I don't know. But it acted in an intelligent manner and it had a great impact on my life. (Just as a side note, I was completely sober and wide awake.)"

They looked like birds but had 2 heads and long beaks which looked to have teeth, my mom's friend started throwing the  food at them in  panic and those  things  grabed the food.

I did start recently going to therapy and taking a mild anti-anxiety medication, my prognosis being ""chronic PTSD"". I've been trying to figure out exactly why it's chronic. The last trauma I experienced was a car accident 14 years ago.   So, I'll share a very recent experience that has some of the trappings of my previous abduction experiences.   I was out on my back patio on Monday, about 2 am, having my last cigarette of the night/morning and listening to music on my phone/earbuds. My girlfriend had gone to bed earlier. I did have a few beers, but I haven't been blackout drunk since my early 20's (I'm 34).  I was having a bit of the odd, electric feeling in the air, but it wasn't as strong as usual nor did it have the sometime ""prep-message"" beforehand.   I finished my cigarette, grabbed my phone, walked inside and went to bed; I still had a bit of that odd feeling. I woke up the next day and went about my business, until there was a violent shaking. I live in SoCal and thought it was an earthquake until suddenly I woke up to my very distraught girlfriend shaking me by the arms and asking if I'm alright.  I immediately asked her what day and time it was. It was still Monday morning but was 2 1/2 hours later. I was sitting perfectly upright on the living room couch. My phone was outside. I've never had a history of sleep-walking and I'm very habitual about keeping my phone on my person (as most of us are these days). She had sent me multiple texts asking where I was during that time. My reply was that I went to bed, woke up, and its supposed to be 2pm on Tuesday afternoon.  I am pretty freaked out, but I'm always kinda on edge and am used to weird things."
aliens,38e34z,Swag3000,3,Thu Jun 4 03:50:57 2015 UTC,This to me sounds like probably the most realistic and true story of an abduction. If what you are saying is true I would check yourself for markings around your body especially next to your ears.

Even leaving the visitors out of the equation, look at the ocean, it is vastly more powerful then us. Even though it could crush us, yet we find beauty in it. There are two sides to every coin and I feel like you are only experiencing one side of the coin.

I live in Australia if that helps at all. it's like 1am and there are no street lights on the road anymore. I am using high beams just to see what is ahead. The reason I was going so late was because I had work that night late and was spending the night to have the whole weekend just chilling together.  I am following a GPS by the way and my friend lived pretty far it was the first time I was ever going to their house so I had no idea where I was going and they lived pretty far from me maybe 3 hours or so.  Anyway I have been driving a while on this empty road and I come to what looks like a very bumpy non-paved road. I was driving down this road for about 3 minutes and I was in a really bad car so I was kind of worried.  I see the road goes to some house which I knew definitely was the wrong place and thought I had taken a wrong turn somewhere but the GPS was probably using roads that weren't built yet but had the plans put on google maps. I have had it happen before trying on a highway.  So I turned around and drove back on this dirt road as I was coming to the clearing back onto paved road when I see someone standing outside near the edge of the road. I came up slowly because I was going to ask for directions. It just looked like a tall person to me. However when I got closer I was instantly fucking terrified. Long limbs larger head very skinny. It looked what I would say is humanoid, but I fucking gunned it as fast as I could. I could see it quickly ran into the bush in the rear view mirror. I did not care what was infront of me, I just wanted to get the fuck away from this thing.  Honestly I don't know what was it was but probably was what looked to me around 8-9 foot tall, no hair, large eyes.   Couldn't tell skin colour too much was pretty dark but it wasn't wearing clothes. I was panicking so badly but kept driving because I was too scared to stop that it would be right behind me. I went back a bit got to my friends house after some time and them what happened.

Probably not the smartest decision (I'm super fucked if it turns out to be something supernatural like a demon, I don't believe they'd tolerate any of that shit) as they might decide to kill me over such words but talking to something you're scared of and yelling fuck in a part of the sentence always makes me feel better.

But in our last night night there, we stayed at ""The Little Alieinn"", the people there are super nice! We had a housemate, if anyone has ever met him, his name is Ron. Super nice fellow!

Anyway, I'd say about 1:30 am, my wife moves and it slightly awakened me. I roll over, in a slight daze, I see two shadowy figures standing next to the bed on my wife's side. I think it was a hallucination from being dazed from sleep. But when I rolled back over to close my eyes, I could make out two large black eyes peering in through the crack of curtains. I didn't think anything of it, my mind was trying to rationalize it whilst trying to fall back asleep. So I just said ""screw it"" in my head and went back to sleep.

EDIT: Well, there are several Wikia projects dealing with similar topics, the first two seem pretty good:  Cryptid Wiki: http://cryptidz.wikia.com/wiki/Cryptid_Wiki The Conspiracy Wiki: http://conspiracy.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Alien Species Wiki: http://aliens.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_Species_Wiki (concentrating mostly on fictional aliens) Unsolved Mysteries Wiki: http://unsolvedmysteries.wikia.com/wiki/Unsolved_Mysteries_Wiki (concentrating mostly/solely? on the TV show of the same name) Paranormal Wikia (""ParaWiki""): http://paranormal.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page ""Ufo-Alien Database"": http://ufoaliendatabase.wikia.com    All this seems very fragmented to me (well, I know it's the double-edged sword of the Internet). I still think there should be a central hub, a central searchable database incporporating all this stuff into one (or not?)."

aliens,38bbs6,rabidoverlord,5,Wed Jun 3 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of red flags in this video before you even start to evaluate things like puppeteering or CGI.    First, the sound itself. Under normal telecine procedures you would not be stuck with the noise of the projector.    To my eye, the video itself looks like it has had a couple of filters applied.  A dust and scratch filter, and a black and white filter, as well as some blurs. Watch authentic videos from the same period of time and you will see what I mean. Put them side by side and it starts to look very obvious.    Additionally with the video, the time code seems to have a different frame rate than the rest of the video, though I've not taken this video into my editing suite to prove this, so for now it's just my impression.    So right off the bat, to me this looks like there are obvious signs of deception, so we're not off to a good start.    All else aside, the blink looks wrong. I'm on the fence whether this is pure CGI or a combination of puppeteering and CGI.    But I hope  some of this answers your question. There are tonnes of things to consider when looking at these kinds of footage, but once you start to see the issues it becomes second nature.    Edit: Spelling"

How i know I'm not being manipulated - earlier on i thought about this a lot, but it all comes into perspective when you balance it against the equations.  that's hard to explain but the UK guy is a good example, so T (the girl) claimed that this guy was posing (basically faking) and he was a product of the accumulation of data by ""contractors"" spying on her at her workplace (a Bank) and  taking her book and making photographs of it.   I said: ""ok so what does that achieve?""   What the ""NSA"" are promoting my Blog now?   no, in fact there is no motive it is what it is, and that's where the ""trust Reddit"" part came from, we had this conversation and then this Binary came though.   of course one could then go further paranoid and say well our audio was tapped at the time of conversation so of course the guy will now say ""trust reddit""   but in the end you have to come back to a motive.   its that sort of equation, I run and i have been in touch with multiple races so in the end if they are ALL conspiring against humanity (humorously) then throw your hands up we don't have a chance anyhow ha ha.

I'd say that all DNA is relatively similar in the mammal side .  And then even back towards insects reptiles, over the billions of years they obviously split off into separate more advanced beings.  So what I'm trying to say to you is there is probably an ""intelligent"" chimp somewhere out there.  People say they see ""sasquach"" or ""yeti"" I say you are seeing an intelligent one of these containers.  They may have evolved perfectly fine on their own, they might be the real ""earthlings""   I haven't learned that so it's speculative.  It could be the case that we are both from somewhere as most advanced races literally ""manage"" planet ecosystems I.e introducing new species here and there if they match with certain types.  But out of the two we were created, I'm not sure if these guys were I'm sure there are purely evolved beings out there , but it would stand to reason that they are the oldest and most advanced.

There are said to be, after all, various different Gray species and various different Reptilian species from various different areas of the cosmos - just as there are said to be various different very human-like species throughout the cosmos as well.  I don't think too many of us are very unique as a species.  The bipedal form is said to be replete throughout the universe, so there are likely many iterations of many different beings.

Additionally, I’ve read that the bipedal Reptilian species is another one that is replete throughout the cosmos, and they may be just as numerous as humans are said to be.

My eyes are always on the sky hoping for a glimpse. Therefore i can be somewhat skeptical when it comes down to it. I tend to lean towards the theory that 95% of ufo sightings are explainable, and 95% of the ones that are ufos are actually American government, piloting reverse enginereed alien crafts recovered at roswell abd mexico and few others. The reason they wont admit anything or declassify their ufo related documents is because they are selfish and it would reveal possibly all the horrible things theyve done to people who speak up or speak out against them. Also they don't want the governments from every other country knowing that they use the UFO excuse to do reconaissance missions in theyre countries flying over restricted air space and being in places they shouldnt be. Abducting their citizens for their own selfish reasons either monitoring them or planting undetectable virus' in them that lay dormant in their bodies, passed down from generation to generation until entire colonies are carrying the virus. It is also the same virus that ia being forced into our children at school in these mandatory vaccines.

It was ""disturbing"" somehow to see the movement of that ""grey"" , as it looks human. Also the special attentions/attitudes of the doctors, like if they were taking care of a human ""fellow"". Also a very troubling detail,  the video was like having somekind of very advanced video compression artifacts / technology for that time (the 90's).  So it look like a real footage from Area 51 to me (or really the best fake video ever, Hollywood production level at least considering the amazing details) and this ""Victor"" interview was very freaky and seemed legit / desesperated (at least to me). Also their is the movie ""Pandemonium"" (kinda stupid/creepy horror movie but good production/budget)  , BEWARE SPOILER following if you want to Watch the movie, so in the movie you can see that the ""aliens"" in the spaceship were actualy human that degenerated after making wars during the spacetravel, which was very long, because they used nuclear power for the spaceship engine, not a good idea ""lol"".    Another  thing that make me think option #1 may be real is that the grey we see on pictures (fake or legit who knows...) have various forms, some looking more or less human, that could fit with the facts they are ""degenerated humans"" coming from various ""timelines"".  Also the stories about some grey who pretendingly captured/adbucted cattle (cow etc) and human could fit option #1. And also some stories about grey footage/abduction are often related to radioactivity , high radioactivity mesurment etc which could fit with the fact the grey are human from a post apocaliptic world with high radioactivty. Last there was this story i ve read once (sorry i dont remember were exactly) about this time travel/grey connection with US govenement especialy (but not only) were it was saying that the greys, Roswell etc, and all that crap happened short after the US have been using nuclear weapon on Japan, which somehow was ""a signal"" to the grey/let them enter the grey into our timeline / some shit like that."

Before that time they (the Dogan) said their gods came from the stars (heavens). Oh by the way, they are still around.  When asked the Dogons pointed to Venus or other stars and never used the term Sirius, nor knew the location.  Gods myths coming from the heavens is common, but I don't believe them as any more factual than many other religions or mythology, including the modern. Damn Ancient Aliens show...  This came from the book The Sirius Mystery written in the 1970s, the same guy who wrote ""The Crystal Sun"", about Egyptians using advanced optics. And ""The Sphinx Mystery"" saying the Sphinx is actually a standing statue of the Egyptian deity Anubis, all buried under it.   Take that however you wish."

That hypothesis was published in a book.  Carl Sagan put forth that the hypothesis could not be true because the Dogon did not know the location of Sirius and were not aware of it's location until they had contact with western scientists. This was factual empirical, documented evidence. As such the underlying hypothesis (that the Dogon knew the location of Sirius) was proven false. The definition of debunk means to expose the falseness of a belief, idea or myth. Which is EXACTLY what Sagan did.  That is how scientific method, logical and critical thinking work.

The old documents and court trials state that there is a cabal that has control of the government, pretty much a shadow government. Sadly, I lost them when my old computer died and i've become too lazy to look them up again.   I'll try to find the documents if anyone is interested. I think the link between gold, drug money and the secret space program/ off world bases/ ET technology is a huge topic waiting to be explored.

The thing about Wilcock, is that one time I was listening to him about how he leaked some info and then he said as a result a couple of people got killed followed by a chuckle. Maybe I misinterpreted? I dunno.   Personally I am not a fan of Kerry Cassidy's personality but she does have a couple of good interviews."

aliens,384njl,Sisko-ire,0,Wed Jun 3 03:45:04 2015 UTC,Irish.
aliens,384njl,no1113,3,Wed Jun 3 18:42:14 2015 UTC,I'm Irish. That is not an Irish accent.
aliens,384njl,Sisko-ire,0,Wed Jun 3 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"Cool.  Good to know.  From the source (i.e. you).  Perhaps it might be an individual that is from Ireland, but that is so traveled in so many other places that his native Irish accent has been significantly colored by the other places he's been to.  Take me, for example.  I'm a native of Puerto Rico.  I am ESL (English as a Second Language).  Spent a few years back home growing up initially.  Then I moved to Texas, however, where not only is the main language English, but many Texans can have a very deep southern ""drawl"" in their accent.  Additionally, the main Spanish-Speaking population where I grew up in Texas was actually Mexican, and the Mexican accent of Spanish is VEEEERY different than the Puerto Rican accent.  I no longer live in Texas, but, as a result of having lived there for so many years and taking all these different influences and mixing them together, my English sounds...very neutral I think (no Texas drawl or anything, surprisingly enough), but my Spanish accent can switch back and forth from a very deep Mexican accent to an even deeper Puerto Rican accent.  Or I can have a neutral Spanish accent.  Both my Puerto Rican and Mexican accents, however, can sound a slight bit...weird if one is listening closely because the accents can slightly bleed over into each other...so neither is ""100%"" and unambiguous.  Another possibility is that the Anonymous caller might be disguising his voice altogether."
aliens,384njl,no1113,2,Wed Jun 3 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"Basically the guy is doing a terrible impression of a fake accent Americans tend to think people in Ireland sound like.

aliens,37ysrc,samlapoint,7,Sun May 31 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the articles premise here:   Despite this, the belief in alien life is still regarded as being fringe and conspiratorial in many circles. Embarrassingly, some of those circles are “academic” circles. Of course, the rejection of alien life is mostly directed toward the belief in complex alien life forms and not simple life forms   The belief in alien life is not fringe, it is almost assured. The argument is not against life, or even advanced species.   Rather the argument is that the vastness of space, and time make the idea of intelligent life visiting Earth unlikely.  This is based on Relativity, e.g. it would take too long, even traveling at near light speeds, for a species to get here.  My rebuttal points:   We know the math for a 'warp' field by which to take us out of normal space-time, so that light speed as a constant no longer has bearing on the craft. If we know this, how about a species that is the equivalence of hundreds of years more advanced. What about a species who can hibernate or use some sort of stasis or cryogenic process to sleep during long voyages?  We are on the edge of very long life, and perhaps even the ability to stop aging. A significantly advanced species may already have done so, as such a journey of hundreds of years becomes simply a matter of stopping boredom. Easy solved by VR. It may also be possible that there are no actual living members of a society visiting us, rather they are using probes and android/bio engineered robots, which means the distance is immaterial. We have probes outside our own solar-system now, what will we be able to probe in 100 years?   On the subject of time being so long advanced species may have risen and died off long before we became advanced, or will do so after we are gone.   I feel this is inherently pessimistic. I think a significantly advanced species that can colonize other planets and has the ability to become nigh immortal would be able to easily overcome this issue. A type 3 civilization would be able to easily mitigate any extinction level event. Since we have learned that the vast majority of stars have 'livable' planets, the odds of overlapping civilizations has dramatically increased. However are still fairly low. But still odds are odds. If space is so very very vast, low odds often become reality.   So yes, while many if not most other intelligent life may not be able to reach out or even have a desire to do so, that doesn't preclude the alternative, namely a few very advanced species may have solved these issues, it just makes it less likely.  The issue is there is so much garbage in the area of UFO / Contact /Abduction that it makes it very difficult for good science to get foothold. It is much the same as arguing religion with science. The humans who 'believe' don't want to hear something that may disrupt their belief system and as such undermine or reject empirical findings. Additionally there is so much pseudoscience, hoaxes, mix up with new age nonsense, and other snake-oil mumbo jumbo, it is very difficult to tell the chaff from the wheat."

aliens,37ysrc,Dibblerius,2,Mon Jun 1 08:10:25 2015 UTC,"So the thing about how relativity works, is time is relative to the observer. So what you say is true only from a objective observer, not for the people in the craft, nor those on earth.  Time slows down in a gravity well, such as earth, and speeds up, as you say as one approaches light speed or is out of a gravity well. But this would be from an outside observers view.  To the people in the ship, 50 years is 50 years. To the people in the gravity well, 50 years is 50 years. However when compared the two will not match. So for the people on the ship 50 years past, but on earth maybe 60 years passed. As such a light year, is still a light year, and a year past ages them a year. Crazy right?   We deal with this with our GPS system all the time, and have to account for the GPS 'second' being faster than the Earth 'second' even though both are using an atomic decay source and are completely accurate.  The space part is interesting as well, for the people in the ship, the ship will appear normal, but to an outside observer, it will look like the ship is elongating."
aliens,37ysrc,orca9999,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:54:14 2015 UTC,"I know how it works man! :)  50 years is 50 years anywhere to anyone ( you never experience time-dilation localy to your self because everything is slowed ), but 50 years are slower or faster compare to things you move relative or that moves relative to you.   It has nothing to do with an observer. It would be the same without people in the space-craft or without anyone observing it.   Imagine a decaying radioactive object on board that takes 50 years to decay. If a ship was sent on a 50 light-year long journey ( 25 light years away and back ) at very near light-speed.  Assume this space craft is un-manned and was built and sent by machines for the sake of removing observers.   On return the object would not have decayed when we retrieve it or ( to remove that observer too ) if no one is there to greet it the object would still spread its radiation on to the surrounding to where it returned.   The point is for the people in the spacecraft the journey to very far places at very near light-speed will not take as long.   It does not take 100 years to cover 100 light-years for those riding the near light-speed vessel! So they don't need cryo-sleep! At 99% years in the universe around them are days aboard the ship.  ( Again to them and to any other process going on, an egg boiling maybe, time appears to move normally. It always does!, but it does not change the fact that time in the moving object DOES move slower compared to things it passes or moves in relation to. In fact it speed does objectively slow down time and I will touch on how it works at the bottom of this comment )  From our perspective watching them leave and come back it would take 200 years ( there and back, a little more since they won't actually reach exact speed of light ) so WE are the ones who would need cryo-sleep or generations if we want to witness the return.   From our perspective ( our relative time not observation bound ) It took them days to cook pasta on board, hours to just sit down in the cocpit chair etc...   Ok here is how it presumably really works:   Everything is always moving at maximum speed ( the speed of light ) through space-time. The four dimension.   It can't slow down or increase speed. It can only change direction. ( a car with no breaks only steering wheel. )  When an object does not move in space, our three dimensions, its direction is straight for the future. ( ie it is taking the shortest path forward in the fourth dimention. Time ) So time moves as fast as it can.   When it moves in space it change direction and thus ( if you picture a vector on paper ) does not go as fast in the fourth dimension. Its speed is the same but since its not going straight towards the future it will not reach it as fast.   This is why ""faster than light speed"" has no meaning. It is the same as saying ""more straight than straight"". At the speed of light in any of the three dimensions of space you are traveling at a 90 degree angle from the future witch means time has stopped.     Edit:  -Yes gravity wells too but reversed, I just did not see the relevance in this travelling example.   -The space contraction you mention is vital to how to the ships time frame it can get so far. Space shrinks to it in the direction of its motion. Perhaps I should have touched on that. Space-contraction and time-dilation are bound to each others properties.   Edit 2 ( lol ):   Oh I just wanted to take the time to comment on something I saw in another post absolutely irrelevant to this but I just noticed it was you.   You gave me the biggest laugh in a thread where some very odd person was trying to convince people of nonsense about asci signals from space and you were seriously trying to debate/explain to him lol  I was like wtf... why is this obviously knowledgable person even still talking to OP hahaha.

None of that would imply that the majority of people don't believe in aliens. Saying ""almost everyone on the planet"" is an overstatement though, considering that there's hard data showing the widespread religiosity of our species and that the belief in aliens would put such religious doctrines to question.

On the tour they will tell you the ""conspiracy theories"" about him are made up. Yet one of the doors in the castle have been broken by humans entering the castle, and no one has ever figured out how to fix it.

Maybe just their tech in general gives off these blasts, also how many advanced races are space bearing/capable?  Perhaps this is some sort of result of their propulsion?

About a decade ago, strange things started happening when I moved with my then still grade school aged children to a new home after my divorce.  One of those things was a very long UFO sighting (over a six hour period) and having a craft fly directly over our house.  There was another similar event two months later.    About a year after that, some strange things started happening in terms of what I will call ""a rude awakening"", which is to say that I was going to wake up from the 9-5 rat race and start living as we're meant to.

It's important to be a skeptic with anything that's considered a conspiracy but at the same time those deaths were all over unexpected and very sad.

There are for example government that have to deal with a big financial crisis and a technology like that would make them rich and solve all their problems. There are nation that are in war and a technology like that would make one win easy. A technology like that isn't possible without the effort of hundred of scientists and I don't see how any of them never spoke about that; I mean, if just one of them take the ""free energy formula"" and bring it in a public university or just publish it in  on the internet, suddenly every person on earth would be able to reproduce it, but that never happened."

It's up to you to see things without the filters that society has placed over your eyes.  No one can remove them for you.  A literal example of this is that you can be in a group of people.  Let's say four people.  You know them all.  They are your friends.  Two will be able to see a UFO in the sky while the other two won't.  I use this literal example because that has literally happened two summers ago.  Some people are more indoctrinated than others.

No matter what room she's in or what part of town, she can hear this.  I hear it on occasion too, but not to the extent that she does.  I had a similar thing with sirens for a year or so.  I would clearly hear sirens when no one else did.  They were somewhat distant, but clear nonetheless.    Have you seen the videos of the sounds in the air (somehow) all over the world?  They're on youtube.  Just search for unexplained sounds across the world.  Watch some of those.  So many -- the vast majority of people -- cannot hear them.    There's so much more too: Giant rips in the sky, strange patterns in the air, all sorts of wild and wonderful stuff flying around like giant golden dragonflies, things that appear to be what the Japanese call mushi (creatures from the manga Mushishi) and so very much more.  I could go on for a long time about this.  I've seen all of this and on and on and on.    Saying that they aren't here is just absurd.  They are.  They're all here.  We just refuse to see them.  We choose to be ""rational"" instead.    If you want to see them, if you want to know, then ask with the very purest of hearts.  They will not disappoint."
aliens,37ipgy,difixx,2,Thu May 28 10:06:38 2015 UTC,"Two will be able to see a UFO in the sky while the other two won't.   what this means? how could two persons see a phisical object and two not?   If you want to see them, if you want to know, then ask with the very purest of hearts.   what that means? should I prey? how can one ask with the very purest of hearts? and how does it work? if one ask with the very purest of hearts suddenly aliens starts become visible to him?"

What I mean by two seeing it and two not is that two are ready for that knowledge and two aren't.  It was funny because two girls rode up on a moped and one said ""Hey, look at that light in the sky.  I wonder what it is..."" and the other didn't see anything at all.  So it really is a thing.  This is why some can and some can't, no matter what paranormal thing we're talking about."
aliens,37ipgy,difixx,3,Thu May 28 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"ok so UFOs could be invisible for one person and visible for another person? how?   Hmm...you're not very experienced in these things, I see. There's nothing sudden about opening your heart. It takes time.   yes I have no experience in opening my heart. I don't even know what that means I'll repeat my question about that point:   what that means? should I prey? how can one ask with the very purest of hearts? and how does it work? if one ask with the very purest of hearts suddenly aliens starts become visible to him?"
aliens,37ipgy,butteryoatmeal,1 point,Thu May 28 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"Although I'm not Christian (in fact I observe no religion), there is a quote attributed to Jesus in the Bible that says you only need faith the size of a mustard seed in order to move mountains.  This quote came to me in meditation.  I didn't know it before then.    At first I thought ""pff...a mustard seed is pretty small"".  But try it.  See how hard it is to believe even that much in something you cannot fathom, that's ""impossible"" to you.  Now see, for me it's easy to know that ET exists and is here.  I know that because I've lived with that specific knowledge my entire life.  It's not a maybe to me, it's as absolute to me as my own existence.  But the kind of faith where you have 0% is hard.  A mustard seed is huge.  The thing that helped me (finally) get a grip on faith was a message I received in meditation, which told me to suspend all disbelief.  In other words, believe everything.  Hear a grasshopper while you're walking through the forest?  Let your imagination soar.  ""Could that have been a faerie?""  In other words, believe the unbelievable.  The message verbatim was:  ""Suspend all disbelief.  Everything is true.""  Can you understand that?  Everything is true.  It's paradox but it's a lot more than that too.  Every single thing is true, as well as its opposite, and all the other perspectives too.  They're all true.  How can that be?  It is.   You have a lot of work to do now.  Purify your heart.  This is your trial by fire.  If you can't see them, you aren't anywhere near the truth, the purity yet."

Why do children see ghosts and believe in monsters and see angels and talk to God and the man with the bloody neck in the corner?  Because they're really there.  We, as ""rational"" adults, don't believe it because our hearts are no longer pure.  They're putrid with the fears of everyone who has ever crossed our path or the paths of our friends, for all of time before our birth.    Are you starting to see yet?  I can't hold your hand through this.  You have to want the knowledge.  You have to commit to the hardest work you'll ever do in your life.  This is a trial by fire, and I don't mean that in any vague way.  It is incredibly hard work.

I can observe things and I can make my own opinion about things. I can know something that no one else know if i'm the only one observing it. More, I changed my opinion many times and I disbelief many things that people said me to be true.   Why do children see ghosts and believe in monsters and see angels and talk to God and the man with the bloody neck in the corner?   because they have a lot of fantasy.   Because they're really there.   so you think that ghosts, monsters and the man with the bloody neck in the corner are true? but I never saw one neither when I was a child, and never heard about a child killed by a monster during the night in his bed. I tend to think that they are not real.   Are you starting to see yet?   no.   You have to want the knowledge   I want the knowledge. I always search for it.   You have to commit to the hardest work you'll ever do in your life   I don't know what work I have to do. Can you explain to me better? because if you say there is a lot to work to do but don't say what this work is I can't follow your advice.  anyway, I was very serious in what I asked you in my previous message.

aliens,37it8q,Swag3000,6,Wed May 27 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"When my son was just learning to talk (about 1 years old) be would talk about ""moon babies"" a LOT before his bed time.  My bf and I have no idea where he got this from.  Logically, it should seem he must have picked it up from a tv show, but he didn't watch tv, we read to him mostly (aside from Barney).  My son turns 3 in July and I can't get him to talk about ""moon babies"" anymore.  I guess as time goes on I may someday have an idea of what it was.  My first thought was UFO's/ET's, and I've always wondered if my son has been abducted.  Some of the phrases my son would say when he would mention ""moon babies"" was; ""Moon babies go fast""  ""moon babies come at night""  ""I like moon babies""  So it seems it was always a positive experience for him what it was."

He does talk to what he calls a ""crabbit"" which I just assumed was an imaginary crab that can talk, and I don't know if it's worth mentioning but my son (according to his pediatrician) has what appears to be a higher than average IQ.  He was speaking very clearly by his first birthday, he could also count to 10 and knew his abc's by 14 months.

To this day I still get occasional visits, It's difficult to explain but I know when they're arouns, I can feel it, the pressure around me changes slightly and I feel as if someone's turned up the heat, and I get this constant ringing in my ear that gets really loud at some points. But yeah op, I'd watch out about your kid, i had many bad visits too, last one I can recall was when there were 2 beings and as soon as I felt them I was overran with dread and just wanted to get out of there but I couldn't move and I soon blacked out.

Instead, some of us interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after. It is ironic that the US should be fighting monstrously expensive wars, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on black projects which both congress and the commander in chief have been kept deliberately in the dark.” – Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defence Minister (source)   first and second sentence of that is pretty intriguing"

But if you listen to his interviews (especially the one with RT) he seems really far out there almost as if he spends to much time watching david icke lectures or he gets to much info from youtube videos, he goes on record saying that theres over 80 known species of aliens and how some of them are already living in secret underground tunnels and bunkers and just really far out theories as if they are indeed facts and many of them are so strange even the biggest alien believers have a hard time believing some of those alleged facts such as billy meier and bob lazars teachings. But just cause i dont personally believe in all his theories doesnt mean they arent true and i respect his right to believe them and words cant describe how much credibility he brings to the field of ufology just because of his former position and I will forever be grateful for him having the testicular fortitude for going public with his demand to the United States government to finally just come clean"

aliens,3787kv,outroversion,3,Tue May 26 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"It has a great and reliable reputation.  I do field investigation work and analysis for MUFON and from what I've seen of the show, they are relatively accurate depiction/descriptions of actual case files.  The files they choose to actually put on the show are all corroborated by at least 1 source or some form of direct/indirect evidence.  The wonderful thing is, that if they represented every case we have with this kind of evidence the show could go on for dozens of seasons, and that's just from MUFON files.  There are more files from Project Blue Book, military wires and files, and newspaper reports from the past.  As someone on the inside of analysis on reports, I think the show is pretty close to a 1:1 representing us."

Also is you look closely it all looks in bad quality but once they get a close up the thing with the best quality are the flying humanoids which usually is a sign of it being CGI"
aliens,377ij6,306mario,0,Mon May 25 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"Playing devil's advocate here, but couldn't the upward movement be explained by updrafts?   An updraft is a small‐scale current of rising air, often within a cloud."
aliens,377ij6,stjoad,1 point,Mon May 25 20:11:55 2015 UTC,Yes it could but for a draft that powerful to move something that heavy (assuming it's about the same size and weight as a human) you would see a lot more movement in the clouds but it seems like there is minimal to no wind in the video.

Using random bits from all the 'lore' and 'narrative' created by these sites across the net, to tie it all together.  Maybe they see it as some kind of social experiment or just ones own entertainment, who knows. But its damaging.  And r/aliens has been spammed out of it recently with this stuff. But you know what? I often read this shit anyway just for entertainment, as it is a fascinating subject and fun to play games of ""what if"". On that note I must say you are extremely unconvincing but I'll offer you the opportunity to convince me anyway. For the craic. So, lets play some AMA.     1 You say you work in the field of cryptocurrency and it was through this work that blue 'aliens' decided to contact you. Because your work 'helped' them somehow and to return the favor in a kinda balancing of karma type way ,as pay back, they helped you, by abducting you and telling you they are real. Assuming all this is true for a millisecond, how do you explain that a race that has been space faring probably thousands of years before mankind came to be here on earth, a race who are vastly more intelligent than we are, yet struggled with whatever problem this is that you worked out. Yet you could fix it? Explain this please.     2 The actual abduction. Time date location. What were you doing at the time, how did they take you. Why no pictures etc. What did the ship look like, can you draw it. Can you find something that looks like the ship and show an example? What was the inside of the ship like? The technology, the decorating, the smell. They locked you and a number of other people in some kind of transparent chamber where you all sat and watched as this little blue guy showed off his/her physical featured to you. Interesting. I find your Teletubby description lacking. What outfit were they wearing. Any symbols? Do they use zips? What were the shoes like? What was their body language like? I presume they spoke with their minds?     3 What did you talk about in detail. I want a blow by blow account, the first thing said to you and what you said back from then on. I need the words and phrasing 'they' used.      4 You have a female friend who is in contact with a group of what you call 'reptilians' via some kinda of device or two. Eh... pictures of said devices please?   5 Names. That's right I'm not letting you away with this one. You are subscribing to a certain section of the Alien/UFO lore and narrative that our universe is filled with not only aliens that look just like us. But also usual ""reptilians, ""insectoids"" and dun dun DUN....""The grays""....  With all these people supposedly meeting and talking with all these species , you think we'd have found out the proper names of these races? Ah but of course that would mean coming up with 'new' information wouldn't it. We're never hearing what they call themselves. Give us the names. What are they called. Oh you dunno? Find out then. I don't accept any of this ""Humans and their weird desire to name everything, we're too advanced for names"" attitude people try and give the 'aliens'. If you really want people to believe you you gotta come at us with some details man.      I'll leave it at that for now."

I specifically asked the people T was in touch with their name and also woudl they be interested in teaching T some of their language, the answer was names are meaningless symbols and they are speaking their language but T hears the meanings for her in English.  so for a long time i had a bit of regret about my first Question, but then i realized the cleaver intelligent way in which it was answered anyhow - by saying the name and telling me that there was a race of people studying.  by default that means:   humans (1 race) the little guys (2 races)  The guy i was talking to (3 races) the race he mentioned (4 races)    so assume 1000's of races.   basically names are useless until we can sit down and have a beer - until ""sit down have a beer"" stage , names are useless.   you can ask the people into ""UFO lore"" for cool names if you like.  : D"

aliens,377ii0,Sisko-ire,-1,Wed Jun 3 03:33:41 2015 UTC,"2. The meeting       roughly occurred about mid 2014 - previous to this i ignorantly believe that ""UFO"" subject was a clever distraction pulled on humans by ""intel"" agencies to distract them from the debt enslavement etc. i'm going to say August 2014 - but i am terrible with both names and dates. ( as i don't see them as important)  I will give some more details, but I'm not going to go in-dept into some things not becasue they are ""secret"" just because it won't help you learn, to you something that is not reality is a ""story"" so if the story does not match up to your pre-conceived beliefs this will hurt your learning.  place was where i haev had a lot of experiences in a Van, (i ""meditate"" in there)    These are the people i met:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVQFBx17AzI   I was ""meditating"" and there was a light - and a ""vibration"" then when i tried to open my eyes (the light was what i sensed with my eyes closed)  I found that i had no vision i could still hear i smelled nothing. i could then for a time sense movement like rotation etc. but could still see nothing, i assumed something was happening.  i didn't panic, I had a sense that there would be a result etc, i.e either i'd be able to open my eyes soon or i have malfunctioned in some way, in which case there is no real use in panicking. ( as i could do nothing)  My visual was ""turned on"" I was seated and i could see some people in front of me in the shapes of humans we were seated in such a way that the if i just looked forward all i woudl see is some people in front of me - the whole room is pretty dark, but the people in front of me are inside what appears to be a ""light field"" almost like ""illuminated glass""  there was no smell that i recall what so ever.  then i looked slightly to my right towards my right shoulder so if i'm facing 12 oclock i looked 1.30 - here is where a wall opened like a square and outside was pure stars in and actually a ""galaxy"" in the distance i remember thinking it is the most amazing thing obviously i have ever seen, actually it was mesmerizing. i've never seen stars like that.  (in this life , obviousness ) then i looked further right, as this closed and there was a center figure a tall guy but i could not see him he was ""blanked out"" i'm not going to give specifics in detail of how i could not see him because if other people come forward they will be able to tell me, but it was in a specific amazing sort of way that i could not see this person.  but around him were the people i described in the account on the Blog - https://kolinevans.wordpress.com/contact/ As casually as if we had just finished a lecture at some part time college I heard a voice that said: ""so does anyone have any questions""  the voice did not say ""so do YOU have any questions"" it specifically said does ANYONE have any questions. at this point i waited, because in my mind i was thinking that these other people are scientists, i even felt in a way that maybe these guys were included like this happens all the time, maybe they are always here and i didn't want to screw up the order of the way things were done so ""being the new guy""  there was no way i was going to ""push in"" and ask a question first.  I waited and heard nothing, i waited what felt like about 30 seconds before i though it was an ""uncomfortable silence"" ( i remember thinking why aren't people asking Questions?)  at which point i literally put my hand up and said ""yes i will ask a question""  the next thing that happened was hard to describe, and led to me being a lot confused when i studied into what i thought happened to me, you see i literally thought i ""met god"" becasue i had had no account of ""UFO lore"" as you termed it and I was like a lot of you guys and thought that there was just us and maybe some other race on the other side of the universe etc.  I can only assume as the Center person turned to face me, what i can only describe as a ""warm radiation"" waved over me - I specifically remember thinking (now i know what ""love"" feels like) it was like if you were to sit in front of a fire on a really cold night but never get too hot or too warm, but the radiation was not just on my skin it ""warmed"" up my whole body.  i waited a little more and figured this was my time to talk , so i said: Q ""how many races/species are there""? I have to tell you there was silent laughter I looked to the right guy he laughed first and then they started to all talk i could hear but not understand  After i asked this Question , i used my voice to do this and it caused a ""visual disturbance"" the guy on my left walked towards me and said in his mind to me  "" use your mind to ask, you can think the question""  after a time of them ""joyfully talking"" the center guy answered me "" and just said "" we don't know"" - but in his mind he said also ""we can't tell you that, what you specifically asked"" like he knew i was asking how many do they know about, but i guess he couldn't tell me. I remember thinking  (i am starting to understand if they can't tell me much then this is for a reason, i have to ask the correct question, and i was thinking to myself the only things that have recently happened in my life are Crypto and Quark, so i'm thinking all this not really understanding he can of course hear all this)  so then i asked "" what about crypto /Quark, is that why I'm here?""  he said ""yes"" and said "" there is a race of people called XXXXXXXX (not saying this name right now) and they have been studying Crypt/quark. at which point a 3D movie began to play in my mind:       The ""3D"" movie      Basically in my mind i started from space and zoomed in to a galaxy and then into a system  then finally to a planet - though the atmosphere it showed these people's ""university"" they all wore a badge of the different things they were studying, the ""uni"" looked like a place in the Forrest there were lots of trees around  the bad they were wearing had the ""Quark"" symbol and some other markers they seemed really proud/happy studying this.   I did not get to see what they looked like, i hope i can meet them soon and ask them how the study went/ progressed.   after seeing the ""Badge""   i was back in the position i was in seated - the movie had a ""roller-coaster"" feel and i remember thinking ""this is mind blowing""    Back seated then then the smaller blue guy stepped forward and showed me what he looked like -    No if they were wearing any suit it was certainly to as appear as skin i saw no sex organs, i saw his face in detail the last thing he did was stand like 5 inches from my face and stare me in the eyes, with a big cheesy grin, ha ha.  at which point my visual was lost - i felt movement again  however then next thing was i either saw this in my mind or i briefly got my visual back - we were in a lit room and i looked to the guy seated next to me and said - no one is ever going to believe this : he looked back at me with a kind of casual blank smile i remember thinking, this ""confirms it"" these guys do do this all the time, he looked like an English guy with blond hair i'd know him if i saw him again.  but i don't know if that really happened or if i saw it in my mind.    i gained visual back fully and was back in my Van it was daylight - but I closed my eyes because i wanted to try to remember and think about everything."

I was not in control it was a 3D movie this is similar (we are told) to what ""Billy Myers"" was shown and he really thought he was on different planets, i could tell the difference. it was as i said zoomed in from a galalxiy into a system into a planet through the atmosphere, then i was shown the outside of a ""university"" just a place where people go to study there were trees I could not see the people except for just form , they looked homonoid, human like, they may have been humans? i.e a human container. Ha I knew you woudl say that, everyone is desperate to believe that. no I can say it was an image that i couldn't reasonably tell if it was a 3D movie or i was seeing.   this has happened many times again, I have been contacted many times - you have to be able to work out what is a 3D movie and what is a 2nd plane experience - its pretty simple to do.  however being in the Ship was a ""3D experience"" not to be confused with the other two."
aliens,377ii0,Raktageno,-1,Wed Jun 3 06:04:55 2015 UTC,"4 All about devices and quantum reordering.       Yes she has a number if devices - the answer to this is to understand how Q reordering works:  Please go to the section of the UK guys account of how he made contact and read the part where i explain ""devices""   its a little messy as far as English goes but you will get the idea: http://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/37gv89/guy_makes_contact_with_race_though_a_pendant_he/   here is the specific part where i explain Devices:  http://i.imgur.com/jfrlOWf.png?1  so for example just like John Lennon and probably many other people received a device :    John Lennon's device  http://ufocasebook.com/lennon.html   (has this been posted on here?)   he probably got high on LSD and had a lot of conversations with them in the 2nd plane but then woke up and thought ""wow what a trip"" or ""wow what a weird dream""   then they probably came and left this on his invite (he thought he was dreaming)   then when he woke up he had no idea what to do with it so he just gave it to Uri Geller.   of course its not Q reordered to Uri Geller's Q freq so to him it would be a chunk of metal or gold.     Stone Henge and the Baltic ""UFO"", the stone circles in Africa  all these places are Com centers - they are all designed from Q reordered rocks the balitic ""UFO"" is not a flying craft it is a large statute of a ""ufo"" and it is blasting out coms to somewhere, there is a city down there but shhh don't talk about it it's a secret! and no one wants to talk about it! ha ha ha.  look its a secret:  http://i.imgur.com/4ZBOqT9.jpg?1  to answer you specifically there is an image of the device out online so i can link it but to you, you will just think it looks like a ""pendant"" :  http://i.imgur.com/Pg7CAQV.png?1  worth mentioning (and this is relevant to the UK guy) these devices are only to establish a ""tune"" but after the user is use to communicating they will then ""sync"" to the other people and the device will not be needed.  I guess this is why it was retrieved off the guy so quickly, after just maybe 1 or 2 weeks of use he wouldn't need any device what so ever.   I hope this has all be educational - i expect this thread to get nuked ha ha ha."

Great Question.      I have to explain you have misinterpreted what I said or I didn't explain it perfectly, (probably the latter)   Yes but it was not a ""pay back"" of any sort , their are a ""group of galaxies"" everyone in membership shares everything on technology and other aspects to the other members, lots of members vary in levels not so much pure ""technological lvls "" but also conscious ""Q soul"" so to give you a simple example there a numerous planets at or just above our level.  So there certainly are planets with fully functional ""monetary systems"" but if they are integrated (i.e ""lvl1"" ) then it is not a Debt issued ponzi like our current system.  Much more advanced races in the spectrum largely do not have a monetary system they literally provide everything anyone needs both though automation and abundant technology.  So I hope I have explained a little clearer the spectrum of advancement.  Now would a very advanced race be spending a lot of time thinking about better way to do something they don't do?   I.e a monetary system ?  Well now you are a little closer to the answer , why I was contacted was because there was an aspect of the system economics and distribution design that was studied and (i assume helpful) now this was used as a ""technical"" way to allow for what happened (i believe) The person I am very close to and have a sort of entwined Destiny is actually a former reptilian Queen recycled as a human ( I know I know ""jupiter ascending"") she even bears some resemblance. (and I have been specifically told that these stories are in part real)   So there you go down a bit further in the rabbit hole.   Yes I think you will see there is no hoax here , hopefully we will all get to meet soon.  I will come back and give answers for the rest when on PC so I can link more easily to help you understand/ learn your last question is amusing ""UFO lore"" that's cute , no we are talking about  a reality. just not one you understand.

aliens,377ii0,BassBeerNBabes,2,Tue Jun 2 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, so it appears what you are trying to say is that: These little blue guys are so advanced that they no longer use money, however some other random planet with people around our level of development were struggling to come up some ""technical issue"" regarding crypto currency. Blue guys wanted to help them, but couldnt ""remember"" how do figure that stuff out because they no longer use money. So they came to Earth and searched on the internet and found you, took your idea gave it to the random planet and then as a reward came back, abducted you and told you they were real.....  Is that right? This just does not add up. This is a bit much don't you think? Original though I'll give you that!   ""he person I am very close to ..... is actually a former reptilian Queen recycled as a human ""  This is utterly preposterous! What are you going to do to prove this to us?"
aliens,377ii0,BassBeerNBabes,-1,Wed Jun 3 03:10:24 2015 UTC,"yep so if you can learn to read properly (i'll admit i'm not the best at laying it out)  you will see i almost said the opposite of that - i said all of the races in membership of the group of galaxies share technology and one race was studying this ""system"" the crypto system.  so that may have been used as a ""conduit"" to show me the things i was shown.  not a reward, I mean you might feel low as a human but i'd say feel proud you are a live don't see meeting other people as a ""reward"" sure it was eye opening. but you are going to meet them anyhow , either this life or the next or the one after that.  I understand how ""preposterous"" that is, let me tell you the People that are on the other side think it is pretty unusual also.

aliens,377ii0,NardAvell,4,Sat May 30 10:46:52 2015 UTC,"Ok so if you learn about the 2ndplane and that we have a DNA image ok.  So one good thing to start is to make your image available somewhere. Because as you become more conscious they probably want to associate a image with the writing.  In the 2nd plane (and here) feelings can be ""seen"" like WiFi basically.  So it's not ""mind reading"" it's more like ""intentions reading""  You can then try different forms of meditation.  Ok so I will explain because I'm shit at ""meditating"" but post the physical meeting there is a time before wake where I'm in a conscious meditative state, this is where I receive any direct vocal or important visual.  HOWEVER.  The girl (who wants to at this time be anon)   Who now has 3 devices from a reptilian race just tried a basic ""past life"" meditation that she found on the internet actually I found it and linked her.  But in her case she is literally family to them (it's a 2nd plane story) reddit censored it I explained it all basically but they censored it.  So what I'm saying is there are 2 states of consciousness apart from here:  1.The 2nd plane And  2. Meditative wake.  Both are real and both are important, I'll try to expand on that soon in here."

aliens,377ii0,BarbarianSasquatch,2,Tue May 26 07:29:37 2015 UTC,"The second plane. Is this visible to humans? Does this mean that others are currently in this plane here on Earth?  Meditative awakeness. Is this something practiced, and is it a way to communicate or a link to the second plane?   When visiting and making themselves seen to humans, do those visits take place primarily here, or do they take people to their homes?  How are we similar, and how are we different? Should we consider their ways of life a goal as they seem to be more advanced? Do they have recreation (music, games, etc.)?  Aside from the larger questions of energy types and cultural driving forces (money, religion, etc.), I would like to know what motivates them. What gives their lives purpose?"
aliens,377ii0,BarbarianSasquatch,1 point,Tue May 26 11:40:06 2015 UTC,"Great Q:  (i will be updating the link on the blog re 2nd plane soon)  (I will make it much more relevant to humans) There is also lots more relevant info.   Ok you are exiting in the 2nd plane right now, if you are conscious here it is to learn , some advanced races ref to this as ""feeding your Q soul"" what they mean is you can only grow by being here. Yes it is absolutely visible you just have to become not conscious here where we are talking ; ) - you will start to understand. (let me expand)  ok Let me explain i'm the worlds heavyweight champion of not being able to mediate , I'm totally useless, i've tried the Gazenfeld I've tried the Key ""past life"" type that so many people have found success with.    so the only way i learned so much is by going to the second plane fully not conscious here, then as i start to wake if there is any important info that literally any race wants to give me they will show me pictures and some times audibly talk to me.   HOWEVER  I bet you can do what i can not.  http://www.wikihow.com/Remember-Your-Past-Lives  The first instruction was how the Girl i know made contact - after she did this for a little while they then gave her devices.  she thought originally that  she had given them to her self from another ""dimension"" multi-veres, (i suspected this was not the case but i said nothing to see where it led)     communication nearly all advanced races know how to communicate to and from the second plane - at various degrees.   I noted the film clip from ""Years and Years""  actually both film clips are talking about a guy being controlled/communicated to from the second plane.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_uoH6hJilc  trust me this is not idle but i better not say any more about that/them.  communication to the 2nd plane is key and important to growing your own education. you can do it through what people think are ""dreams"" (they are not i will explain in blog) or through mediation.    Re visits, nearly never taken to a home world, i'd expect that would be risky, what a lot of people confuse is a telepathic ""movie"" its like meditation so for example i/we were in space we were some where far from here, but then i was show a ""movie"" of the other people ""home"" I could tell the difference, maybe some people can't becasue i mean it was like a ""rolla-coaster."" so similar in so many way, they are us we are them but we just have a few little tiny maturity steps to take understanding the 2nd plane is key becasue once you really know this you don't think and act so ""short term""  They like all the things we like, there is a basic ""money"" but its is just a basic accounting system of how to distribute abundant supplies, there is really no ""rarity"" maybe ""creativity"" in some cases but there is no material rarity. so the idea of wealth is ""shifted"" its kind of meaningless, of course there are heaps of other planets like ours now - and all the same problems are basically seen.  big motivation is to get the universe to a higher state of consciousness, i guess its the multiple effect if the 7 billion people here can become integrated once we get over the ""shock"" of abundance of everything then a lot of people are going to want to go and help others you see?    like i mean other primitive planets that are about to ""shift""  or unmapped ones that are enslaved etc.   The universe both plane work off the ""free will"" equilibrium, everything is related to free will, if you understand that then you are 50% there."

They have touched on everything you mentioned so far. The presentation of the material is a little sensationalist but the show still has great content imo.

aliens,370qbo,____dim____,2,Sat May 23 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"I actually bought Millennial Hospitality (and the second book) on my kindle.  Interesting read, I can't say I was super compelled to read the second book however (and haven't yet).    There wasn't anything in particular that put me off about his story, in fact, most of it seemed plausible but his writing style was just so, idk, not interesting (this is a poor choice of words, I'm struggling with description).  I was really the most interested in his first hand experience with the ""tall whites"" which he doesn't get into detail about until towards the end of the book.  It almost seems like his story is either all made up or there are details that he's leaving out.  Has anyone else read the book(s)?"
aliens,370qbo,rakkoma,1 point,Sun May 24 09:57:25 2015 UTC,I've read them. I think they're the real deal.
aliens,370qbo,crazylegs99,2,Sun May 24 11:21:49 2015 UTC,"Did you also get the sense that there was missing information?  Maybe I was reading too much into it (no pun intended) but he made it seem like anyone could have an encounter with the tall whites if they went to vegas essentially, which to me seems like there would be more incidents that we would hear about, more people coming forward with maybe ""hybrid"" claims or something of that nature.  I also felt like there would have been more that should have taken place at the briefing, it seemed so inconsequential I guess.    I want to read the second book but i wish it were more information based and less story-like (because I feel that Hall is not a very good story teller)."

aliens,370qbo,anti_h3ro,2,Sat May 23 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"And truthfully, I can't find any list of the 500 guest speakers at Disclosure. 500 is a lot, I would says there's a fair chance he was there."
aliens,370msi,____dim____,5,Sat May 23 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because western governments have our best interests in mind. /s. No, it's because they're worried they could lose control if the truth got out. I think they're also worried about what kind of non-petroleum energy technology these beings are using, and how it could undermine the hegemony of the powerful oil industry. Richard Dolan talks a lot about that."
aliens,370msi,hashmon,3,Sat May 23 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"You mean lose control as in lose money. I'm going to sound naive, but wouldn't all this new technology create new jobs and sectors? Also, what would stop today's fortune companies from acquiring all the patents and resources? They already have the money to build new infrastructures, I don't see who else would have such a big head start.  Manufacturing saucers on an industrial scale could also be bad news for peace. If militarized, saucer fleets could potentially be shipped across the world in mere minutes. Grand scale invasions would be significantly facilitated. No one would be safe, as vast distances couldn't be used as buffer zones anymore. Maybe ET is keeping that tech from us for this reason."
aliens,370msi,hashmon,3,Sat May 23 23:30:26 2015 UTC,"Wo knows what the ET's a thinking. (I like the term ""ultraterrestrials"" better, because I think they're probably terrestrial, or at most of them). Well, Dolan's point, which I think is valid, is that so-called free energy technology isn't so easy to control and monetize. Once that shot gets out, it's like anyone could access it. Petroleum is ideal for controlling people, because powerful people have their hands on the spigots, and it's seen as finite. I mean, this plays out, too, if you look at how Tesla's technology was repressed. But, you're right, evil people could certainly try to use the technology, and most UFO researchers think they already are. Dolan theorizes about a ""breakaway civilization"" of powerful humans who have been developing these technologies based on recovered crafts for a long time.  But I think there's a whole other reality at play, on the level of spirituality/religion and life meaning. If people knew there were lots of other beings and intelligences out there, this could dramatically impact how we live our lives. This would give a lot of people hope and meaning. Many people would want to interact with the aliens; deep secrets could come out that the ruling governments don't want out (starting with the fact that they covered this shit up for so long). The are released documents showing it was a priority for the U.S. to bury the UFO story, and I think they had good reasons from their perspective of maintaining the status quo. And, personally, I've had profoundly positive, even revolutionary, paranormal experiences. There are clearly some non-human intelligences that are trying to help us advance, and the evil people out there don't want that to happen. Smoke DMT or take ayahuasca if you want a sure-fire way to have a really profound transdimensional encounter."
aliens,370msi,hashmon,3,Sun May 24 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"You're right, there would be no finite resource to make money off, and all of their infrastructures would become obsolete. It would really be big oil's downfall. The government would take it in consideration when contemplating a disclosure, and I wouldn't be surprised if they would prefer to keep lobbyists happy rather than advancing civilization with new technology.  As for a spiritual awakening, I think it would be complicated. As stated in the article, humanity could lose it's identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. But if humanity could look passed that, I think there's a good possibility some would expand their minds, as humbling as it may be. Yet I wonder if some people would not be able to adapt, and end up in arms, or diagnosed with a mental condition and very low self-esteem.   As for DMT, I would love to try it one day, but it's probably very hard to find. And you have to ask yourself if what you saw wasn't simply hallucinations. I've read a few testimonies and everyone believes it's real."
aliens,370msi,Thenewpkmn,2,Sun May 24 00:57:36 2015 UTC,"I'll just tell you, the experience is entirely real, and entirely life-changing. There's a distinct interaction with a separate intelligence that goes on. ""Just chemicals in the brain"" doesn't really mean anything. Obviously, something is happening at the physical/chemical level, but that doesn't make the experience invalid. I mean, so many people have paranormal experiences not related to tryptamine psychedelics, but if someone is curious and wants to have one- a DMT or ayahuasca encounter is a sure-fire way to do it. It's insanely intense, though.   Yeah, western governments are not going to disclose the UFO phenomenon. They have too much to lose. Russia? I really doubt it, but who knows. Really, I think it's up to the grassroots to spread the information and, ultimately, to try to connect with the friendly beings ourselves. Maybe the deepest change comes from working out in the spiritual realm; that's what I think at least. DMT has been my tool of accessing that realm, and it's a hell of a tool; it seems that it was left here by whoever for this very purpose. Other people have other ways of navigating spirit dimensions, though; my aunt, for instance, practices non-drug shamanism. She's seen some of of the same stuff I've seen by using specific shamanic techniques. It's the real deal. There are also obviously dark energy beings out there, but they're not the ones that ayahuasca and shamanism leads you to."
aliens,36y755,racter3,3,Sat May 23 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"Just because they could be considered our possible ""creator,"" does not give them immediate divine status, nor the right to ""manifest destiny"" all over us. Just because they may have made us doesn't mean they deserve to be worshipped or supplanted to. Just because they maybe our ""architects,"" or ""growers,"" or ""designers,"" doesn't make them the ultimate authority in these VAST multiverses.   I for one refuse to live with anyone's boot on my neck. The human race is bizarre, irrational, and even violent....but I feel it is more fitting for us to make our own mistakes, and if that means burning out and fading away in the abhorrence that is the collective human ignorance, then so be it. At least we would go out being the humans that we are, and doing it on OUR terms."
aliens,36y755,BarbarianSasquatch,10,Sat May 23 22:36:57 2015 UTC,Jesus wouldn't give us an ultimatum like this. That would be sufficient proof they would be trying to enslave us. I would fight.
aliens,36y755,____dim____,7,Sat May 23 03:13:27 2015 UTC,"This might sound dumb but.. Ever read the book of Revelations? Many of these theories and ideals sound eerily similar to the depictions of the end of the world.  That there would be someone claiming to be a Jesus figure and show proof to make it look legit. This guy would be considered the antichrist. Those that believe him will be spared of the ""torment and agony"" that the non believers will endure.  After that ordeal (and a few passages later) the real Jesus will show up and save the true believers from their misery and punish the traitors.   Reading that I interpreted that (in this case) a group of bad aliens will come, fuck over a good majority of us, then a good group of aliens will come and liberate us from them, thus living peaceful lives there after."
aliens,36y755,El_Catrin,4,Sat May 23 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"Fighting an advanced alien race with our current tech do we even have a chance?I think most people will fight, but after a while when there are big loses we would stop and serve them. Of course, everyone that truly believed in God would be disappointed if everything turned out to be from some sort of an alien. Let's say the Aliens have created humanity I.E. Adam and Eve, wouldn't they be our creators and sort of like our God? For creating all of this? Throughout history God has killed many people over small reasons, what's the difference between an Alien and a God that kills its own creation or asking it to serve them."
aliens,36y755,____dim____,2,Sat May 23 04:54:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think God really slaughtered people for small reasons. You have to make the distinction between the Old and the New Testament, where one is a collection of stories to make a point or instill fear, and the other is about the teachings of a truly holy man. They would have to contradict themselves big time, and lose all credibility if they taunted us like this. And suppose they really did create us, that wouldn't mean they're God. They could've created our bodies, but God gave us a soul, a spirit, for which he even asked the angels to bow before in acknowledgement. And yes, fighting them would be suicide, but it would also be a great sign of faith and devotion to the real god. ""Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell."""
aliens,36y755,legitasl3alls,2,Sat May 23 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"This is actually very profound. It doesn't have to be viewed from a religious standpoint, which is why I am assuming you were down voted. To me, it reads as wisdom, not as fear (religion). Hell isn't a literal place where you go to suffer for eternity for not being compelled to believe the ""right"" things. Hell is a state you put yourself in or allow yourself to be put in."
aliens,36y755,canadianculture,2,Sat May 23 08:14:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. The God of the teachings of Jesus is not the same as the god of the ancient testament. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking they are the same, but they are not! God is beyond ideas and definitions.   The teachings of Jesus are not about believing stories about the old god, nor about adam and eve or any of that. The teachings of Jesus are profound because they are about connecting to our source and contributing to the world. It's about healing our relationships and healing the world. That is serving God."

aliens,36sud6,Conspiraco66,6,Fri May 22 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"I have heard that the non terrestrial officers thing was actually just a referencing officers that are stationed on a super top secret black op in mars and have been there for many years. I heard about this secret base about a year ago for the first time and didnt give it to much thought, and then either yesturday or day before i sern an interview with a former NASA employer who was working with nasa whem they sent the first mars rover that successfully landed on mars, and in this interview she said that when the rover landed on the surface of mars for the first time, when the first turned on the cameras to get their first look at mars, they clearly seen 2 humanoid figures walk up to the rover and start inspecting it. She said they humanoids like beings were wearing sometging similar to the spacesuits we are used to seeing astronauts wear when we see videos of them doing moonwalks while at the space station, excepy the werent as bulky as the ones we are used to seeing but that she definitely thought they were humans from earth. That makes sense if they are spending an extended peroid of time there and want something that allows more freedom for movement and isnt so bulky.    She said as soon as it was on and the people seen what they saw that the feed was shut off almost immediately. So she went to the main control room to ask the head honcho (forget exactly who she said) what they saw and that the door was locked and there was paper covering the window. And they were just told by the powers that be they didnt see nothing and forget what they saw and it would cost them their jobs if they said anything. And she has been holding it in waiting til she was no longer employed there to tell her story to the public.  So i put 2 and 2 together she never said anything about non terestrial officers but that is my theory on it, which seems alot more likely than people traveling billions of miles to zeta reticuli. The interview was just done this week if yoy google it if not i can look for it. Anyways thats what im thinking so do what you will with this info"
aliens,36sud6,BigFang,6,Fri May 22 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't believe that now in all honesty. Sure look at all the research and money going into just trying to get people there now.  Between the radiation, severe isolation, 5 years of traveling one way and everything else I don't believe there could be humans on Mars in a secret base.   I'd be open to little green men underground there but definitely not humans."

aliens,36sud6,pharmaphilreview,0,Fri May 22 18:19:16 2015 UTC,i bet they can get there way quicker they have technology leaps and bounds above what they tell the public  edit:and the company that is trying hardest to get to mars fir the mars one project isnt associated with nasa or any US agencies that would be involved with black ops therefore they would basically have to start from scratch doing all their own research and stuff and wont have accesd to the secret alien technology at area 51 and other places so i find it extremely plausible that there id humans on mars right now. We've jusy been slowly findimg out that US has anti gravity capabilities whether they engineered it themselves or reverse engineered. I dont think radiation will be a problem that they cant figure out if they havent already which im guessing they have.

aliens,36pdc6,JadedMagic,16,Thu May 21 01:43:29 2015 UTC,"Nope if anything it reaffirmed my belief that we know absolutely nothing about the nature and origin of this crazy universe. I think god is too primitive of an idea personally, but I guess that depends on your definition of god. I enjoy entertaining the theory we live in a simulation. I don't think aliens created us for a purpose, if they can travel all the way here chances are they could accomplish anything they wanted with their superior technology. I also like to entertain the idea that aliens sent out asteroids to populate other areas of space. Who knows though? I always thought it'd be hilarious if I died and ended up meeting the Hebrew/Christian God and some how all that craziness was true haha"

aliens,36pdc6,JadedMagic,1 point,Thu May 28 09:20:29 2015 UTC,"See in my opinion, i dont really like to follow theories that people have come up with on an explanation of the universe. I just told my self one day that i was going to let go of any thoughts of god that had been drilled into my head from other people and decided to start discovering the world from an unbiased, natural point of view. Somehow that slowly led me all the way back to god, but in a way that i actually understood. In my opinion if you want to find accurate answers, start by pretending you never learned anything about the universe and ask yourself the most basic questions you have, do your research, and then question your research. Do that until you have no more questions about your original question and you should have an answer for yourself. Do this for every important question you have and hopefully everything will start making more sense"
aliens,36pdc6,JadedMagic,2,Sat May 23 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in these theories, I entertain them. I don't like to have an answer to my question. I leave it open because it can't be answered. I use thought experiments because they make things entertaining, like Nietzsche and the Eternal Recurrence. If I don't have any questions about the origin of the universe or god or whatever then I'm philosophically dead. Those aren't questions that can just be answered."
aliens,36pdc6,Orikon32,0,Sat May 23 10:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, there are answers to everything. No matter what you believe, there is a way that the world as we know came to be, and that way has to be the one truth. Now i dont think anyone is ever going to fully discover that truth, but we have discovered a lot of it such as math and science. Naturally those laws have always held the world together, and Im pretty sure its impossible to deny theyre existence without lying. Math and science might be the limit human comprehension of the world, but they are still true. So the main point im making is that the truth is always there. One just has to choose either to accept it without questioning, or question it until it is acceptable."
aliens,36pdc6,wanlave,0,Sat May 23 13:41:09 2015 UTC,"There aren't answers to everything though. Mathematicians even disagree if math was discovered or it was invented. You can go on believing in god I'm not trying to stop you, whatever makes you happy. Me personally though I think the fact that we can't be sure what happened in the beginning makes it way more interesting. How does math and science relate to god anyways? That could easily be interpreted as this whole thing is a simulation created by some super advanced civilization, or it could support this whole thing happened by aliens, or by chance. And like I said I don't believe anything, beliefs are limiting. I'm open to new information to play with, the christian god literally makes no sense. Explain Gobekli Tepe, Hinduism, shamanism and all the other religions/spiritualities that are so much older than the bible. The bible is a book that has been translated god knows how many times into so many different languages that don't have equivalent words. Catholics have a different bible than christians who have a different one than the hebrews, who invented him in the first place."

Enoch also said he was taken to their quote: mothership, where he flew through space and saw planets.   Book of Enoch is about 8000-10000 years old found around The area of then Sumeria. In the sumerian Texts they also mentions the anunnakis and The nephilims, they also had a Detailed map of our entire solar system with each planet named and described in The right posision from The sun.  Book of Enoch has been removed from all modern bibles though he is mentioned in one of The verses."

aliens,36pdc6,blove135,0,Tue May 26 10:43:06 2015 UTC,"Actually the book of Enoch was never contained in the bible, although it is quoted. Enoch was the grandfather of Noah, and the bible tells us that Enoch was brought before god in his dwelling. The book of Enoch though was written by multiple sources and possibly not even Enoch himself. Its hard to even determine who exactly wrote it which makes it more uncredible in my opinion. Some of these old writings may have some truth in them, but one probably shouldnt base theyre whole belief in god off of it."
aliens,36pdc6,ghostdate,2,Sat May 23 13:25:32 2015 UTC,"I think The modern relegions are just watered out, misstranslated and rewritten versions from The earlier religions found in Sumeria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and all of Europe called Peganism.  They workshipped several beings and alot of Their stories are found in the bible. The quran and the torah.  The best example of E.T contact in ancient times is found in Sumeria. Thats The earliest civ. We have discovered and it was also here the earliest form of peganism is found  in that time Sumeria was higly advanced compared to the rest of the world who still lived in caves. They were The first to develop writing, science, astronoms, a structured society ect.  The beigns they workshipped lived with them and was their teachers. Later this civ spread out to babylon, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and then the rest of Europe.   It could all be just a coincidence and just happend or maybe there is a conection.   I choose to believe, not in some god but in ETs"

aliens,36pdc6,logan_izer10,2,Sat May 23 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion, science is our way of understanding what he created. And the science that would be required to understand him completely would be too much for us to understand."
aliens,36pdc6,RyHe11,5,Sun May 24 04:28:33 2015 UTC,I believe aliens are interdimensional beings. The fermi paradox is one of the reasons I don't believe aliens are from a far off planet. When you begin to look at aliens being from dimensions outside our own then a god that is from another dimension is not that crazy. These dimensions could be so utterly incomprehensible that our human senses don't allow us to see/feel it or whatever we would call it until we die and move on to that other dimension. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWyTxCsIXE4  We may be in a sort of flatland and God is Dr. quantum.
aliens,36pdc6,RyHe11,4,Thu May 21 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with this idea. I feel that a lot of atheists believe that the only ideation of God is that of the major religions and Religious artworks, where God is an all caring being that spends his days sitting in clouds trying to help everyone on their path in life. I believe the idea of God is much more expansive than that, and that if we ever saw God we wouldn't even recognize it as such. I also believe that this interpretation of God is responsible for all things, whether it knows it or not, much like how atheists view nature, or physics or math as responsible for all things. Two sides of the same coin to me, the laws of physics are just a framework put in place by the unimaginable thing beyond reality that created it. We're only its creation in that it made the universe, which spawned life, and in turn spawned humanity, which in turn spawned you and me. I don't believe there's a God that cares about any individual's wants or needs, but perhaps cares about our universe as a whole and not destroying it."
aliens,36pdc6,ReginaldBaker,0,Thu May 21 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"I really think you explained it well how science and math is all real, just a part of how god created everything. What i dont agree with is that god doesnt care about our individual lives. I dont know your religious reasons for god, but in the bible the universe was based off the earth, and god spawned us from the earth. He made us so that we would have the chance to believe in him and follow him. We were made in his image, meaning that he has the emotions that we recieved and wants to be loved by free-willed beings. God definately does want to protect everything he has created because he loves all of it,  and in this universe we as humans especially."
aliens,36pdc6,JadedMagic,0,Sat May 23 05:16:01 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with that, because in my opinion god created the angels to be in those upper dimensions/planes with him, but some of the angels left theyre dimensions to join the dimension we live in, and they became fallen angels or aliens."
aliens,36pdc6,JadedMagic,3,Sat May 23 04:57:49 2015 UTC,"depends what you mean by god, if you mean belief in jesus christ and belief that there is a single religion that i agree with then no, I still think that whole story is a big book of lives and was created to control and dumb down these masses in order to keep them from thinking about the whole subject and keep them from finding out the truth and letting each and every persin form their own set of beliefs that works for them. On the other hand it has forced me to spend alot of time contemplating on what i do actually believe and at this point in my life i'm very confused about the whole the thing. Now I spend alot of time meditating and am trying to reach a point of inner peace and will contunue to meditate every day until either god or whatever spiritual being exists and tells me what the answer im searching for is"
aliens,36pdc6,ReginaldBaker,-1,Thu May 21 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well to talk about the truth, there is only one natural way that everything exists and that way is the truth. And if the story youre talking about is the bible, it actually is not a book of lies. If you look at what is written about life in our universe, every fact ligns up to what we know historically and scientifically. Modern technology has also led us to discover physical evidence that characters in the bible, writers, and even Jesus himself did exist. Although not every story or parable mentioned in the bible can be confirmed as happening or not, nothing has been disproved and there is much truth contained in it."

aliens,36pdc6,fitfox13,2,Thu May 21 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. It may sound crazy but hey, we all seem crazy at times to people on this subreddit. In my religion the Virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus, and he was the son of God. I believe that he was an intentional hybrid or something. He performed ""miracles"" and something that baffles our perception of reality as humany could be taken as a miracle. And to explain the actual writing of the bible even before Jesus was born, the bible states the God spoke through different men throughout the bible and essentially told them what to write. Telekinesis is a very real thing when it comes to beings beyond earth.   I have alot of thoughts on the matter but thats a short take on it."
aliens,36pdc6,thefluffiestdog,2,Fri May 22 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"Thats interesting that you think of Jesus as a hybrid. When i think god, i consider the trinity, which im guessing you have heard of. In case not, it means that god has 3 forms all while still being a single being. In my opinion i think this means that jesus was the incarnation of god himself into a human form so that he would experience the hardships of a human life while still being god at the same time."

aliens,36pdc6,Donnie373,1 point,Thu May 21 22:40:45 2015 UTC,"Thats cool man, and to be honest i have had encounters with evil (in a more spiritual way) and they led to my belief in god too. You can see in every human aspect of life that there is good and evil. Thats why it seems to me like in the end the evil will be defeated by the supreme being, God. Cause he created all thats good and it makes sense that he would be the ultimate judge and conquer evil."
aliens,36pdc6,Donnie373,1 point,Sat May 23 01:16:20 2015 UTC,"Good and evil are totally relative though. If you were raised doing child sacrifices you wouldn't bat an eye at it because that was normal to you. Also if god created everything than he also created ""evil""."
aliens,36pdc6,____dim____,0,Sat May 23 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"If theres no standard, i guess it would be difficult for someone to determine good from evil. But obviously ending the life of something that is helpless is evil, and if you don't question yourself for doing such a thing, then you are ignoring part of yourself. Ignoring the good side or evil side would lead to an imbalance in yourself. If you want to be healthier, you have to acknowledge that both sides exist, and then choose which way you want to live by. Also, what i understand to be evil was caused by Satan, not God. In my opinion, God created everything and he made it to be perfect and good. He also gave his beings one of his own traits which was the power choice. When he made the angels, they also had the power of choice and when one of them, Lucifer (later known as Satan), chose to break away from God and turn against him, that was when evil was made available in this world. Evil wasnt created, it is just the absense of good."
aliens,36pdc6,logan_izer10,1 point,Sat May 23 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"You have plenty of examples of people killing others and justifying it with their religion, and they never felt any remorse because it was doing good in their eyes. Crusades are an example, jihadists are a more recent example. Today yeah if you killed a someone in America we would say that was evil because our culture doesn't accept it. Your culture and upbringing teach you what evil is. Look up stories of what feral children are like, no concept of good or evil because no one taught them. God created Satan though didn't he? So he indirectly created evil when he did that. If god is also all knowing wouldn't he have seen that coming? Just food for thought."
aliens,36pdc6,logan_izer10,0,Sat May 23 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest i think you have a really good point. The suppossed ""Christ followers"" that killed others in gods name, im not sure what rules they followed. I guess unless you follow gods rules that are listed in the 10 commandments, there is nothing to base your morals off of and its basically whatever you want to do. Also for my take on it, God did forsee Satan's betrayal, but he allowed it to happen because he gave him free will."

Since the frame rate of the gif is 1 fps, I was finding it difficult to determine the speed changes, as mentioned in another post. I created this jpg to help visualize the changes in distance. So with that jpg, it becomes more clear that the driver slowed down, seemingly at about the time he would have noticed the ""alien."" If anyone is interested, this time I picked a point in the distance to stabilize the frame, instead of stabilizing the alien. Then I just overlayed them one by one in Photoshop. There are 8 frames total that the alien is in.    So after my two images (the stabilized alien and the overlayed sequence,) here are a few list of pros and cons.    Pros: - Lighting is consistent with a real object being there. - I see no evidence of CGI trickery - Whatever it is, it does seem to be moving its arm.  I can't say for sure whether it is actually moving its head or not.  It might just be a play light.    Cons: - Potato quality - There's a hell of a lot of compression artifacting in the original gif - There are only 5 frames where you can actually see what you are looking at. - 1 fps: this is the biggest one for me. How do you even film at 1 fps anymore? - Is that the moon in the background? Setting really fast?  My initial impression is stop motion. That would explain the movement of the arm and head. It would also explain the 1 fps. And it would also explain why the moon seems to be going so quickly. It would also explain the terrible quality. Lower the quality to a ridiculous level to hide imperfections.    Edit: spelling."

aliens,36ndci,sputnikorbust,3,Wed May 20 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"Its arm moves, and something shoots out of the hand.  The head also moves.  I keep hoping that someone will determine if it is CGI.  If it is a mannequin I would like someone to figure out how it moves.  It can't be someone in a suit.  The body is far too thin to be human IMO."
aliens,36ndci,Conspiraco66,3,Wed May 20 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"I will play the skeptical card here, though obviously there is no more evidence to support mysuppositions than any other theory. But I want to provide a possible explanation for how the figure moves, and appears to move.   If you look at the original image, which shows the context around the figure, the shooting light looks like it most likely a reflective object sitting at a fixed point, just changing it's relative angle between the figure and the car. A similar light can be seen in the first couple of frames of the gif. This point I am fairly confident in, and I'd need a pretty detailed video analysis to convince me that the light isn't a fixed point.  The movement of the arms and head is a little harder to explain. Going with the assumption that it's not a human in a costume (which I agree doesn't look likely) the a model like this could be made so that it had arms that could move slightly in a breeze. The head motion I'm not even convinced was real. It looks like it moves, but given all the imperfections in the film, it could just be reflections, compression artifacts, and paredolia creating the impression of movement.   Also, this is all based on the assumption that some humanoid mannequin was left on the side of the road for unknown reasons. If you are willing to accept the possibility that this was a deliberate hoax either by the driver, or that the driver was a victim of, it is trivial to come with a number of mechanisms that could explain any movement of the arms or the head.   Again, I'm not saying that anything in the video proves my points (except the light being a stationary object) but the video shows so little that can be verified to a useful degree that it doesn't really serve as good evidence of anything, except that something was on the side of the road one night. And if you read /u/rabidoverlord's theory that it is stop motion, it isn't even great evidence of that."

There are people who have spent their entire lives studying worms. If there is a way to communicate with them on their level, then we've done it. If we suddenly found a new kind of worm somewhere, you can bet your ass we'd be interested in it. Intelligence without curiosity is impossible."
aliens,36l1l7,milestyle,5,Wed May 20 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"I like your thoughts on this but what if there are plenty of worms( us ) in the universe? Most worms don't get to interact with humans, save the unlucky ones who end up in a lab or on a fishing hook.   What I'm getting is maybe we're not all that unique and maybe they come across many of our level of consciousness. Worse yet maybe the difference between us and them is so great they don't really see a difference between us a chimps or even rats?"
aliens,36l1l7,Dibblerius,1 point,Wed May 20 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's break this down. Say there is an alien race that is so magnificent that they find us boring. There are actually some things we can assume about them. Since life is so rare and the universe is so big, they must be able to perceive enough at once that finding another planet with intelligent life is mundane to them.  We are talking about near omniscience. we can stop right there, because these beings aren't as great compared to us as we are to worms--they are much much greater. We are basically talking about gods. Now say there is an alien race as superior to us as we are to worms. There are actually some things we can say about them. They exist is the same reality as us, since we exist in the same reality as worms, so no trans-dimensional beings... no cthulus, sorry. They are made of matter, and their intelligence is a result of the interaction of matter.  They have a few extra senses, and the senses they share with us are way better, but they still just observe the same reality, just in ways we may not understand. These guys would still find traveling between stars fairly difficult, and they'd still find life on other planets fairly interesting because of its scarcity. What they wouldn't do is find any reason to hide from us, since we could care less about hiding from worms. More likely they'd jump in the middle of town, take pictures, dare their friends to eat one, and be home in time for lunch.  Basically my point is that if aliens are here, then they are far greater than us, but not outside the realm of understanding."
aliens,36l1l7,milestyle,2,Wed May 20 15:19:44 2015 UTC,Interesting!   I wasn't quite suggesting if they were here but the possibility that we would be so common that we would not have been visited.   Kinda like not every colony of worms in the ground have been found or disturbed by humans.

aliens,36l1l7,NerevarTheWise,8,Wed May 20 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"That's assuming we know what their basis for intelligence is. His point was that while we seem intelligent to us, that doesn't mean we would seem intelligent to them. You're making assumptions about what they would consider intelligent. In the grand scheme of intellect, we don't really know where we stand. We might not be too far removed from that worm. To a being on the highest end of the spectrum, humans and worms wouldn't seem all the different, both would be incredibly simple life forms.    You guys suggested that because we study worms, they might look at us the same way and want to study us. But again, that's assuming we know anything about the way they would work, on a physical or mental level. Maybe they could just take one look at our species and be able to interpret everything about us from that one look. They might not even need to study us.   Human beings have a habit of thinking of everything in relation to themselves, that's why it's so hard for people to comprehend how big things like our galaxy are, or how minute an atom is.

Some CIA are informed on the subject, but truly black projects operate independently according to the video. And they must spread to many areas of expertise, like this world banker who believes she has inside knowledge of a second race operating on Earth (but I find her story sketchy)."
aliens,36kx8g,____dim____,1 point,Thu May 21 03:02:09 2015 UTC,The military must be somehow involved. Area 51 is a military base and it's widely believed that the army or air force or whoever use and experiment with parts from fallen extraterrestrial crafts.
aliens,36kx8g,thekraken108,1 point,Thu May 21 12:46:39 2015 UTC,"It would be weird if an entire military base would be operating independently from the government in the wide open, I agree. I was saying this because the video of the ex-CIA mentions that president Eisenhower and a general had to threaten whoever was in charge at area-51 with military, to give them a report of their activities. Area-51 told them they had no jurisdiction over them. It's at 7:40 in this video."

aliens,36hm6s,no1113,1 point,Wed May 20 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Into the Fringe. From what I had heard in the late Dr. Turner's talks and read in that book, she seemed to be one of the few authors/researchers that share similar beliefs to myself. The only two complaints I had were:  1) I hope the researcher/hypnotist ""Barbara,"" who is featured in most of Dr. Turner's works, is as reliable as Dr. Turner believed she was. I'm not saying I don't believe in hypnosis or using it for memory regression, but one cannot always trust whoever is doing the regression. Ideas can be planted like a seed corn in the mind of someone under hypnosis. I would like to do more research on the researcher.   2) The minute Dr. Turner begins to try and draw comparison between ET messages/abduction and Joseph Smith's founding of Mormonism, it made me have to slam on my breaks. I'm sorry if any of you are a shade of Mormon, but I find most forms of Organized Religion just....silly. She basically pondered to herself that maybe the angel that visited Joseph was an ET in disguise.  Okay....so....IF Mr. Smith WAS visited by an ET and that ET DID help him found Mormonism, then why? Why? The only conceivable reason I can think of is: The ET that may have visited Mr. Smith was an anthropology major that made a bet that he could create a religion and get us upright monkeys to follow it. Hell, if Ancient Aliens is to be believed, all religions are Erliens. Maybe they are, I sure as fuck don't know.   I am almost done with ""Masquerade of Angels,"" not nearly as good as ""Into The Fringe."" It took way to long focusing on Ted Rice's love life and girl problems. It really doesn't get into the ET Phenomena almost past halfway through the book. Up until that point it's just Ted Rice's autobiography, which gets repetitive and pointless at times. (SPOILER ALERT) Got to Ted's childhood Reptilian rape scene...the whole thing just made me think, ""This could all just be repressed child abuse. Maybe Ted really was raped, but this is just his form of coping?""   I'm not saying I don't outright believe him, but now the nature of the Abduction has changed and has become a scenario, that for all we know, could be very real childhood abuse done by family. I am going to have to see if this scenario is more common in Abduction accounts than I think it is.    Going to check out ""Taken"" as soon as I can."

If the government, or whatever powers that be, can look at us and say ""well they're about 50-50 split on a video of a puppet doing nothing"" then what obligation do they have to release the truth? At that point we're just playing into the spreading of misinformation and hoaxes that they want to be able to cover whatever truth there is out there.  I've said it a million times, but far too many people in this community treat it like a religion. They use baseless claims to reinforce their beliefs instead of any real critical thinking, research, or other due process.  ""How do you know God is real?"" ""Because I was trapped in the middle of the woods and I prayed for help. Minutes later a helicopter flew overhead and saved me""  That is the same flawed, shit logic that most people on this sub and general community use. Can we all agree to begin instantly rejecting posts like this that are clearly fake (or at the very least offer NOTHING towards information about aliens or disclosure)?  We need to steer away from the bias lunatics in this community who will believe anything to reaffirm their current beliefs!"

aliens,363xg2,nickmista,6,Sat May 16 06:18:42 2015 UTC,"There was some video i saw before where someone saw a UFO which turned out to just be some jets flying with their afterburners on directly away from the viewer's line of sight such that they were not moving up,down left or right from their perspective. So that may be a possibility.  A supernova that bright would probably make the news so a quick search would give you an answer but given that I haven't heard anything that's probably not the case(a visible supernova would be a pretty big deal).  Most stars and planets sparkle and change colours slightly due to atmospheric turbulence, moisture etc so an especially bright object may appear to twinkle like you described. So if it was a jet or something similar up high enough you may not hear it, see it move and it could twinkle.  Then again I wasn't there which is a very significant factor. How much something twinkled, how bright something was and how little something moved is difficult to convey in words without being there. It's quite likely that the brightness, twinkly-ness and steadiness is quite unexplainable.   Can you go outside and look at jupiter when you next get the opportunity and estimate how much brighter it was?"

aliens,363xg2,butteryoatmeal,4,Sat May 16 02:39:16 2015 UTC,Really a lot of the same information goes on both.  Aliens is for abductions and stuff about aliens.  UFOs is for UFOs.  I guess.   Sometimes I think the subreddits should just be combined.  There are a few others like /r/uap but there are very few posts to these.
aliens,363xg2,xcelleration,2,Sat May 16 02:41:52 2015 UTC,"I don't feel they should be combined; UFO's and aliens may be commonly associated with one another, but that's kind of silly. UFO's are unidentified! Otherwise they'd be ETFO, or something."

aliens,364b9e,chewieconcarne,1 point,Sat May 23 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"It was in a dream a few days after having a very strange ufo encounter. In the dream it wasn't the stereotypical barn owl from fourth kind, but what seemed to me a mangey grey (what I thought was) sort of young great horned owl (google searched and couldn't find a great horned owl that matched). I reached out to it with my index finger and middle finger. Now, I don't often remember my dreams let alone FEEL things, but this Owl had a vice-like grip. So distinct and real that I said to myself IN my dream, ""must be my girlfriend doing that back in the real world.""  That's how vivid that sensation was. Also, I didn't feel six talons that should be on an owl, but rather three. Three fingers squeezing my two very tight. I look into its eyes (which weren't the black I have heard about) and I suddenly feel like I have to save this owl. I take it outside and hurl it into the air. It sort of glides away from me, while doing so, the air around the owl begins to shimmer a blue glowing light. Then the damn bird explodes in a white blue light, and the next thing I know I make out a dark shape flying across the sky.  I know it's probably a dream, but a few mornings later I woke up with marks I didn't have before with minor pains. I have had a minor head ache behind my left eye every day since then."
aliens,361jxv,mitchconnor92,2,Fri May 15 09:13:25 2015 UTC,Well there was that guy who thought he had been abducted and had implants in his arm and thought he had operational scars all over his body (he didn't) and he used a small metal detector which gave some sort of signal that it detected something..
aliens,361jxv,wyldcat,2,Fri May 15 11:58:43 2015 UTC,What makes you think he was lying?
aliens,361jxv,indistinctMUFC,6,Fri May 15 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"Because all his scars were either nothing at all or pimples. It was just normal skin and was like ""yep I have a scar here, here and here and here as well"".   The metal detector if IIRC went from 0 to like 0.5 when he pressed it at a certain area on his arm really hard. It went down over other areas but he didn't press as hard as he did over the ""implant"", so it was hard to tell. And it could've been anything really."

aliens,35y1hg,DiscoDave86,7,Thu May 14 14:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm using Tor already, but I was thinking file sharing. I don't have knowledge of how much of metadata stays in each and every of files. So far I've managed to learn how to remove metadata from few sources. I'm not willing to expose myself as I said, because It is dangerous by nature for any source. Unfortunately I personally know of two people who have been involved with all of this and have disappeared since they started talking more openly. I'm not seeking any publicity, what I know, what I got is what I will share. I'm trying to write down everything that has happened to me and everything I've learned. As soon as I'm sure I haven't missed anything and all the details are there, I'm going to share it, post it, upload it and be gone. This most likely won't affect much in short term, but holding all of it secret is tearing me apart. McDonalds and Tor it is then. Should I use megaupload?"
aliens,35y1hg,Trigger6,12,Thu May 14 15:59:07 2015 UTC,"TOR from McDonald's still wouldn't be 100% safe. TOR isn't absolute anonymity. A typical McDonald's has multiple camera's inside the store and on their grounds (outside). Therefore you need to have a computer that isnt your primary and you have never used for anything personal (banks, email, blogs, facebook, etc). And need to make sure you are disguised from camera (hat with throwaway clothing), don't drive to McDonalds (license plate), ride a bike for a decent distance so cameras couldnt track your movements.

Use of black and white (technology that is old by now - so must be by design) further hides things like a grey body suit over the mannequin (but couldn't hide the articulated knees, or the spade type hands - no fingers), in this low light environment and so one could not easily detect the color changes.  There would be no reason to 'prime the pump' with this announcing a 2 week reveal when a quick Google-search would tell you how to post anonymously. In fact, posting this would already preclude that activity, as you already posted your intent. If anything it would make any 'men in black' types find you easier. After all you told them exactly what you are going to do.  Sorry, I don't believe a word you are saying.

(Alternative have two or more usb cards for gifs/vids/photos) Find an local computer cafe/libary, an place where you can lend an computer for free. Be sure to scout the place first for any cameras or things that might give you away. Split up you're data in diffrent usb, go to one cafe and upload some of it, then go the next one a few days after and upload more. Be sure to be fast.   gl"

aliens,35yc80,Backpacks_Got_Jets,14,Thu May 14 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Well, from the accounts of people like Mike Clelland it seems like our image of aliens can very often be a screen memory, of owls or anything else. So maybe what we see, even in photo or video evidence, may be a ""mass screening"" of some sort. Which means, the alien exists but we can only process the contact in a certain way. Which might explain why our image of ufos and aliens has fed sci-fi and pop culture, which in its turn has fed our image. I wouldn't be surprised if aliens are consciously using our fascinating with pop-culture to present an image which won't shock us. Having said all this, the ""screen memory"" theory would also suggest that the events of a contact experience reveal more about our psychology than theirs. So there's a common theme in the accounts: nakedness of the alien. Also, nakedness of the contactee often. Then there's the topic of anal probing, which is often joked about, but I think reveals a lot. All these elements point towards the topic of ""vulnerability"". Being naked in front of other naked beings, and having your anus probed is like maximum vulnerability. Maybe this is such a common theme because the contact experience is so new, so ""alien"" to us that it makes us feel vulnerable. So that, regardless of what happens during the experience, maybe we remember such things as naked aliens and anal probes as symbols of our psychological nakedness. Another theory, though, is that it seems like a lot of contact experiences deal directly with the ego. It feels like a lot of what they want is to dissolve our ego (I take the stance it's a friendly contact). Maybe our ego has gotten so out of hand that it's a possible threat to other planets down the timeline (which they would be aware of through time-travel of a sort), or maybe it's out of pure love for us that they want to heal us from our neurotic ego, like doctors. That also could explain all the ""operating table"" symbolism of the experience. So maybe, if we were less afraid of nakedness and vulnerability in our culture, they would probably appear in very different forms to us. But we're too constipated as a culture imo."

To be honest it was probably more expensive for them to organize all the big event, to pay the guests, all the media, the streaming, etc... I think of this event more like enthusiasm blinded them. An unwise movement. As for the hybrid thing, I strongly believe on the hybridation matter. I believe that non-human beings were here in the past, tought us many things, techniques, tools, etc, some of them even mixed with us (for what they were punished) and that's where all the matter of hybridation plays its part. I also strongly believe that the Bible (and many other ancient texts, others a lot older than the bible, yet we're more familiar with the bible) has the key to many of this topics. We just need to know how to read it, how to interpret it. Of every phrase in the Bible you could write an entire standalone book of thoughts and interpretations. It can be hard to closed minds or not very intelligent people, but the bible tells a lot more things beyond the aparent fantasy that most of the people only sees and ridiculize..."""

I once believed that what was following me was a ghost of some sort.  My mother has lived in two ""haunted"" houses and rarely speaks of her experiences, but the stories she has told me always pointed to my own strange occurrences as ghosts.  Anyway, I no longer believe what is following me is a ""ghost"" per say.  I have very vivid dreams every night, sometimes this is amazing, but when they are vivid nightmares (I have had dreams of myself dying multiple times) it can be quite terrible.  When I awaken from these dreams its almost always between 2-4 in the morning, and I always have the feeling that I am ""being watched.""  On a few occasions I have actually had something touch me after I wake up.  Besides the dreams I've had numerous weird things happen to me (doors closing when I knew they were open, things not being where I put them, etc, etc.) This has always been a part of my life, so I just accept it, and until recently I always chalked it up to a ghost, but the more I have researched aliens and alien abductions the more I'm thinking it isn't a ghost.  A brief history of ufo sightings in my family include: My maternal great-grandfather seeing a ship and its ""drivers"" over his barn (local airforce came to speak with him about the incident), my maternal grandfather being followed home (20min drive) by a ufo, my father seeing a ""ball of light that just took off"" above the treeline while he was hunting, and myself seeing a ship two different times (it sounds crazy, but the first time was right after I thought ""if anyone is up there you should let me see you"" as I read thinking about contact can open one up.)  Since then more and more occurrence have been happening, I have seen ""shadows?"" directly above my bed and moving in S's room, I have also seen a ""ball of light"" fly in from outside (my room's wall is located on the outside edge of our apartment) and I watched as my cat followed this ""ball of light"" out of my room and into the living room.  Don't let this next part discredit anything, as it has only happened once to me, and once to roommate C, but I have also ""heard"" a voice when I was in that still asleep but kind of awake stage, the voice ""said"" (its hard to explain because it wasn't in my ear) ""Remember, but don't tell anyone.""  It was a deep man voice, and the same voice told my roommate C to ""get out"" as she walked into her brothers house in an entirely different city.  It has only happened once to both of us, and neither of us have any family history or personal history of mental illness.  It sounds crazy, and I personally wouldn't believe it if it hadn't happened to me and the people I trust most.  The last thing I have time to post is the marks on my body after waking up, I have a birthmark that wasn't always there and the first time I recall seeing it was when I was 7-8.  My grandmother also asked ""is that a bruise?"" to which I replied ""I don't think so, its been there a long time."" It is on my right shoulder blade and is pictured here (http://imgur.com/RqZP16W).  I read some of the comments on here, and I'd just thought I'd say my maternal grandfather is actually a preacher :).  Apologies for the long ass comment, and any spelling/grammar/formatting errors."

aliens,35s7wu,Sato_Satellite,3,Fri May 22 07:23:45 2015 UTC,"You don't need a preacher. Religion or whatever you think keeps them away doesn't. The intention and belief you put into those acts does. Which can be done in lots of ways, such as sage & salt. Recognize nothing can enter your reality without your soul consent and it can't ultimately 'harm you'.   If you want to communicate with he/she/they, try meditating on an intention. Or use a symbol.  This video has some decent info on discerning their true nature, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNvjwLVjNU  Also, google for a picture of a ""Grey alien"". And let me know if that has any effect on you or your roommate. An extreme fear of their appearance is often associated with abductees."

And me, I was trying to sleep on a couch, and i heard an extremely air-y voice say my name close to my ear lol. Other stuff too, of course...  Personally, I'd only recommend a Christian preacher, even if you aren't one. I'm no expert on this issue specifically, but we did have our house cleansed and it fixed the issue.  I've been told to say something like ""In the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave"" if something is happening right then and there.   One of my navy friends tells me her house is also ""haunted.""   My other friend got her house cleansed recently, which she said the demon ""survived,"" so she's getting it done again.   I'm near 100% positive it's a spiritual encounter, and I believe nearly all of them are demonic. I really recommend the cleanse."

I've read about disasters happening after someone smudged their home, and my friend asked me about that a couple weeks ago as well actually. The best analogy I can give for this is: let's say you have a cut (not you you ... but you know what I mean), so you go and clean it out, think you've cleaned away all the dirt and germs. But ... You don't put a bandage on after ... germs will get into that cut again and make it worse. So ... That is why a ward is needed. To anyone reading this ...  So yes ... anyone attempting to cleanse their home please please put up a ward after. Everyone you banished will just come back."

W's family has a history with aliens. His grandfather saw a UFO over his farm in the 50s. The FBI/CIA (not sure which) came to his farm and told him to never speak of the event again, and provided no details. His mom has had a number of strange experiences that she basically refuses to talk about. W, himself, had a UFO of some sort follow him for about 20 miles before zooming off.

aliens,35j7gw,imaginarywheel,12,Mon May 11 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"Timothy Good mentions two cases where he believes he encountered beings disguised as earth humans in his book Earth: An Alien Enterprise.  Once, at an airport he sent a telepathic message asking anyone from another world to sit next to him.  A man does and he telepathically asks the man to hold his finger to his nose for a moment and he does.  The man gets up and gives him a serious look and walks away.  There's also the Charles Hall story of the tall whites on a military base in Nevada that visited Vegas."
aliens,35j7gw,imaginarywheel,3,Mon May 11 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard much on Timothy Good. Does he speak of any other times when extraterrestrials may have disguised themselves?  Any suggestions for good reads by him? In this he recounts another telepathic message that lead to meetings between extraterrestrials and Potus Eisenhower.   ""His meeting with the cosmic life forms is said to have taken place while officials were told that he was on vacation in Palm Springs, California, in February 1954. The initial meeting is supposed to have taken place with aliens who were 'Nordic' in appearance, but the agreement was eventually 'signed' with a race called 'Alien Greys'.""  Interesting how Charles Hall describes ""Nordic"" looking extraterrestrials as well."
aliens,35j7gw,King_of_Ooo,2,Mon May 11 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"Good definitely talks about other cases where ETS were reported to be living among humans.  I haven't read any of his other work, but this is the quote on the cover of this one:   ""I have the highest regard for Good's absolute integrity, his determination and skill as a researcher, and his wide and detailed knowledge of the UFO experience."" -Lord Hill Norton, former Chairman of the NATO Military Committee.  John Keel also talks about aliens living among us in his book UFO: Operation Trojan Horse.  I know at some point he talks about how worried people in Washington were when they realized that aliens could blend in with us and the assumption was that they had infiltrated government positions.  The Nordic description seems to be pretty common in the literature.  I believe the advanced humans that Admiral Byrd discovered living at the north pole matched this description.  If you can find the flight log and diary entries it's really fascinating."
aliens,35j7gw,King_of_Ooo,10,Mon May 11 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"In the Spring of 2011 I was living in Bournemouth UK, which is a medium sized town on the south coast of England.  It gets a fair share of strange people, mainly crowds of young men and women on stag / bachelorette weekends.  There are a lot of small hotels and B&B type places.  I worked there as a lecturer but I am not originally from the UK so I find everyone a bit weird over here.  Anyway, one day I am on my way from my flat, down toward the beach promenade to go jogging, but I am still up on Westcliffe road where all of the hotels and such are located.  Coming towards me I spot the weirdest pair of people I've ever seen. A tall, oriental asian looking fellow, about 30 years old, and a tall, thin oriental looking woman with him.  Both are walking right in the middle of the road, briskly, and dragging those rolling luggage cases behind them.  Right in the middle of the road, not on the pavement/sidewalk.  What was so strange about them was their clothing. The man was wearing a kind of long black cape, made of a very fine material, like a microfibre.  He had also some shiny track-pant like trousers on.  It looked chic, but also completely bizarre. You wouldn't normally wear trackies and a cape.  They had dark sunglasses on. The woman was classically fine featured, and the man was very good looking / square jaw, like a movie star.  There was a weird plastic kind of feature to their skin, like it looked as if they had tons of makeup on.  They were striking enough that I stopped in my tracks, turned around and watched them pass me, in the middle of the road.  But for some reason I didn't follow them, I turned and continued ahead. Now, coming up towards me, on the pavement, is another weird pair!. Another man and woman, but this time with Mediterranean coloring, and not as tall as the oriental couple.  They were smiling at me but not really acknowledging me, its hard to explain.  I got a good look at them as they walked past, and what I noticed most of all was their skin looked plastic, and their hair looked fake, like it was glued to both of their heads. The hair on the woman especially looked strange. They blew right past me and I don't recall turning to look at them, even though they were the weirdest characters I'd ever seen in Bournemouth, and there are a lot of unusual people there.  Now, there is a final chapter to this strange encounter.  Later that weekend, I was down at the Pizza Hut on Westover road, in a different part of town, to pick up my takeaway order.  People are going to think 'no way!' after reading that other pizza story, because this is one so similar.  The Mediterranean man and the woman both come shuffling in as I am leaving with my order! The man is now dressed like a cowboy. I mean, jeans, boots, plaid shirt, everything. And the woman is hanging on his arm, like she is having trouble walking.   I hear them say to the person taking orders, 'What is pizza?' in a kind of dissonant, Kermit-the-frog sort of voice. and I am like WTF!?  Who on earth, who speaks English, doesn't know what a pizza is?   Again, I kick myself for not just staying there to watch more, because it was so weird. But the weirdest part, is when I leave the pizza hut, there across the street, sort of hanging out in the bushes of the Bournemouth gardens, is the oriental woman from the day before!  She sees that I notice her, and she quickly kind of ducks behind a tree.  Who knows what would have happened to me if I went over to pursue her. I just turned up the road on the brightly lit side of the street and went home with my pizza. SO disappointed in myself that I didn't try to engage them in conversation, but they were super weird and quite creepy, so my spider sense was like, GTFO.  It is all 100% true.  I even told some of my colleagues about it, and they suggested that I saw a group of supermodels in town for a convention, from a faraway place like Moldova or something. But I am pretty certain that they have pizza in Moldova."
aliens,35j7gw,King_of_Ooo,4,Mon May 11 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comprehensive reply! This was a great read! :)  Aliens masquerading as supermodels? And not doing a very good job of it. You would think supermodels would know a thing or two about hair/makeup, and be worldly enough to know of pizza. It's odd that the couples always seemed to be in the same vicinity, but never together. They also had similar peculiarities about them. By your description, it almost seems as if they were trying to emulate certain stereotypes at different times.  I've done a quick bit of research and I've found that Bournemouth has an arts university, that has even been featured by Vogue. I can't find when the fashion school has their shows, but I would infer that it's around Late May/Early June. Maybe you saw a pack of wild art kids?   The fact that they didn't know about pizza (another comment in this thread mentions the same phenomenon!) makes me wonder whether or not there's an ""Earth Travel Guide"" on some planet, who's author forgot to include an anecdote about some of the best food to ever exist. :)"
aliens,35j7gw,phanes15ishtar,5,Mon May 11 20:41:05 2015 UTC,"Chemotherapy surviving, wig-wearing supermodels from Moldova was what my colleagues actually settled on. They aren't ready to seriously consider the ETH.   A couple of features I forgot to mention. Admittedly, it was a had-to-be there kind of experience, to really appreciate the weirdness.  But, I think we can all agree that human beings, whether ordinary people or supermodels, have imperfections.  You don't notice those imperfections in daily life because they are so normal they almost go unnoticed: skin blemishes, a hair out of place, a rip in the jeans, etc. I've seen loads of Bournemouth Arts students and they look like your typical UK hipsters. These people I saw didn't have any imperfections.  They were too symmetrical, too perfect looking, to the point that they stood out. Their hair was crazy perfect, as if it had been coiffed out of plastic strands to look like a 1950's kind of hairstyle, on the men.  Another thing. They walked all herky-jerky like. They didn't have a normal stride when I saw them booking it down the main road. In the pizza place they sort of shuffled along, and the woman was wobbling on her feet. Maybe they had tried some earth beer before hitting the pizza restaurant, who knows.  Finally, the thing about the oriental man that also struck me was how tall he was. I estimate about 6 foot 2 inches. I have never seen a Chinese person that tall in real life, although I am aware there are basketball players etc. But I'd never seen that before."
aliens,35j7gw,King_of_Ooo,2,Mon May 11 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, outer-worldly for sure. You lived in Bournemouth, so I'll take your word for it. I don't think I've ever seen art students, or anyone look as perfectly weird as you describe these strangers. Did anyone else have any visceral reactions to them as well?  Man, I love this sort of thing. It's crazy that you saw them on multiple days as well, as it adds more credit to their bizzareness."
aliens,35j7gw,phanes15ishtar,2,Tue May 12 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"Even though they had a goofy appearance, they were very confident. They gave off a vibe that made me think that nobody would mess with them, no matter how strange they were acting. So no, I didn't see anyone else react to their presence. Normally people just kind of keep their heads down and mind their own business in the presence of weird behaviour. Makes me wonder if maybe the post-rave-scene UK is an ideal place for non-humans to come and 'blend' in!"
aliens,35j7gw,wyldcat,2,Tue May 12 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen something like that too, a few years ago. Guy on the bus looked waaaay too perfect. His hair looked like exactly what you described, and it was the strangest color of yellow too ... like beeswax. Looked like it was made of wax too. Skin was perfect ... looked like he was wearing a ton of makeup as well. And not a hair in sight on his arms or face. Looked really ... unnatural. I looked around too to see if anyone else noticed. No one ... It's like I was the only person seeing him."
aliens,35j7gw,NorthChan,2,Wed May 13 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, wax would be how I describe the hair, too.   Also, I couldn't see where the strands connected to the scalp, if that makes any sense."
aliens,35j7gw,wyldcat,2,Wed May 13 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"Can't say if i noticed that. But I do remember looking at his arms and not seeing veins, like how you'll usually see veins on a guys forearms. No veins no hairs ... He was thin too so it's not like his arms were too fat to not see veins.   The perfection threw me off. I guess the best way to describe him would be like a corpse at a viewing - all painted up, perfect looking, while looking lifeless. He also had piercing blue eyes o.o   I was also thinking maybe he was a nazi experiment lol ... so Aryan. He wasn't that tall though ... just odd."

aliens,35j7gw,phanes15ishtar,8,Mon May 11 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the bad grammar. I'm french and it's early... This happened about 15 years ago. I was watching television with my two roommates when the door rang. One of my roommates answered and came back to get me, saying it was for me. I got up and was met by a young lady I didn't know, dressed in a sexy one piece dress and no coat on. It was -4 degrees fahrenheit outside. She asked if we could speak in private, so we walked a little further into the hallway. I don't remember the initial dialogue, but she really wanted this discussion to be private I guess, because at some point she grabbed my hands and we were suddenly speaking in another language. I don't even know what language it was. Could've been russian, swedish, portuguese... I don't know. She asked me if I thought she was pretty. She was very adamant that I tell the truth. I was disoriented by this whole situation, so I started asking the real questions ; ""Who are you?"" ""What are you?"" ""Are you supernatural, are you alien, are you demon?"" ""Do you believe Jesus is our savior?"". We went back and forth like this for about a minute, after which she got pissed. It's worth noting that I could feel a lot of heat emanating from her. When she realized the discussion was going nowhere she suddenly stormed out, very angry.  A week or so later, one of my roommates came back from work in a sort of panic. He said there was this lady outside who was on the ground screaming in pain and with no coat on. We thought it was probably hypothermia so he went back to her with a blanket, and we called an ambulance. I should've go check to see if she was the same girl. My other roommate was creeped out, even though he knew nothing about my encounter. He was just uncomfortable with the situation, for some obscure reason. Oh and there was a helicopter buzzing outside.  Another occurrence, this one very different... Not long ago I had a discussion with my psychiatrist about some examples of how people react negatively to my presence. I try to put the blame on social economics, the fact that I'm poor and unemployed, and hard working people see me as a lazy bum. I cited examples like this lady who spat on the ground when seeing me, or this couple walking with their baby in a stroller across the street judging me with a look of disgust on their faces. Occurrences like this happen daily and are hard to digest, so they were in the back of my mind for pretty much the entire week. Later on that week I had to go to the dentist, and as I was going back home we drove by this tall lady, also pushing a stroller. She looked snotty and a little extravagant, and it just felt like she wanted to grab my attention. When she saw me she immediately spat on the ground in disgust. That lady was like a painted portrait of everything that was troubling me that week, all put together in one masterpiece. I don't know if that's just a coincidence. Maybe there's more to it. Maybe I was taunted by something which has deep personal information of my state of mental health, and it acted on it in a devilish manner. If aliens are indeed blending in to the general population maybe some are leeching on negative emotions?"
aliens,35j7gw,____dim____,5,Mon May 11 11:27:30 2015 UTC,So you let a random stranger in your home and held her hands as if you knew her your whole life? And why not call paramedics if she was like that on the ground?
aliens,35j7gw,phanes15ishtar,0,Mon May 11 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"We did call an ambulance. We probably should have picked her up and carried her into our apartment too. I guess we were a little stupid back then, being teenagers and all lol.  And yeah, I did let her in. I think she kind of let herself in, in some manner. I remember her coming off as being very driven and hard headed. But yet, she didn't really appear threatening. And I was pretty curious because she asked for me by name. Plus it's not every day a young lady comes knocking on my door.  What's really weird is the question she asked me ; ""Do you find me pretty?"". We didn't get to have a conversation because I immediately put the brakes on, but I wonder where it would have gone if I hadn't. Surely she wanted to see me for something more serious than a personal looks inquiry."

aliens,35j7gw,Deedubau,2,Wed May 13 13:20:30 2015 UTC,"She was not on drugs. Drugs have nothing to do with this. I think you guys are looking past the fact that I actually spoke a language I don't even know. I had a little trouble finding some words but I found them eventually.   And that helicopter could very well have been military. Maybe some shadowy government agency stopped her before she could reach me a second time. Maybe it's the reason why she was on the ground screaming in pain. I don't think people suffering from hypothermia scream in pain (I could be wrong). And remember, there was a lot of heat emanating from her when we spoke, so much that I got a little worried for her. So maybe that was a special ability of hers, to stay warm in the freezing weather. That's all speculation, but it's all I can make out from what I remember."

I was just saying I don't agree with the explanation always being ""drugs"". Doesn't explain that.

I had already started walking towards the door to leave the room when I thought to myself that it would be nice to introduce myself, so I think I might have caught him off guard.   I didn't notice his hands prior to the shake, honestly during our discussion I was heating food and making a fresh pot of coffee. So I didn't directly look at him for long until I approached him. The handshake instantly felt odd, my thumb and his ""finger intersected as per a normal shake, but I held the center "" finger"" in my hand, the longer finger felt like it wrapped around the top of my hand, the tip touching the base of my wrist."

It saddens me knowing that there could be some vast lively universe filled with intelligent life communicating and interacting throughout the cosmos, but I just don't feel that we as a species have progressed far enough to interest other species that may have interstellar technology to communicate with us. We're still dumb animals who wage war on our own species :\"
aliens,35gtv0,OHNOitsNICHOLAS,11,Sun May 10 18:54:33 2015 UTC,You should look around and open your mind. I dont mean that in a mean or condescending way. But us citizens are not the ones that are preaching for war. Ask any individual in the world and 90% of them will most likely say that war is not necessary for existence. But the ones in power are the ones funding and lobbying for these wars. Another point id like to make is: ask any individual citizen in the world and they would likely tell you that if there is intelligent beings out there we'd like to communicate with them. So far the only people who communicate with extraterrestrials are the people in ownership of this planet and those are the same people funding our wars so how do you explain that? The people who have all the money know about creatures out there but they still keep us fixated on wars happening here and they still strive to keep us as slaves in their system of bs paper money. A lot of people here on earth want help out of this system of slavery yet no alien race wants to help our species out. Maybe its not that were a war driven species maybe extraterrestrials couldn't give two shits about our species being enslaved by greed driven individuals.
aliens,35gtv0,eliasrichter,4,Sun May 10 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Ask any individual in the world and 90% of them will most likely say that war is not necessary for existence   War may not be necessary for existence, but it is necessary for control.. hence why the wars are being started and fuelled by those in power. I really don't see it being linked to a an alien presence, as wars have been going on since the dawn of humanity, and ""wars"" are even found in other species such as ants and other primates.  I am a very open minded person, and I believe in the possibility of intelligent life that could traverse the cosmos, but I have serious doubts that they have anything to do with the current state of our world.   I feel that if intelligent species did exist and are in fact visiting our planet that it would be far more likely they are here to do anthropological research. I also strongly feel that if any species was to develop the technology to be able to travel the cosmos they would have moved to a point in their society where they've figured out how to live in balance with each other and nature as opposed to starting petty wars."

There are probably MILLIONS of civilizations in the universe, probably with galactic federations and all sorts of shit, and we don't even know anything about it!  So many questions and too few answers. This man was one of the few that answered them.

aliens,35gtv0,BarbarianSasquatch,8,Sun May 10 07:51:42 2015 UTC,It definitely surprised me. You'd think technologically advanced races would be mature and get along with each other.
aliens,35gtv0,COCAINE___waffles,4,Sun May 10 07:21:05 2015 UTC,"Not if their motives and wants differed. It doesn't always matter how far one has come technologically, if the owners of that technology have wants/needs and the means of fulfilling those wants/needs, of course they could go to war for them. Especially if someone or something else could inhibit them from fulfilling said wants/needs. You don't need to be necessarily ""more mature"" to be considered ""more intelligent."" For example: To master space flight is to be ""intelligent,"" to use space flight to help usher your species as a whole into a state of harmony with the known universe is to be ""mature."" There can be entities that master this level of tech but implement it for reasons that aren't particularly helpful to anyone outside themselves, that is to be considered by some to be ""immature.""   It can be thought then that one can be advanced technologically but still be stunted emotionally, which is an easy recipe for war."

If you have something and I want it and I have the means to take it, that's precisely what I'd do. The other side probably feels the same. That's what war boils down to in my eyes.   The higher you go on the technological scale the higher form of war you could wage and the more resources you would need to feed that beast. Wars fought just to secure what you need to wage more wars. I'm not advocating it, I'm acknowledging a sad reality that's mirrored here on earth and I don't feel would be any different out in the stars."

However if there truly is unlimited wealth in this world and we can attract whatever we need whenever we need it (something Bashar is very vocal about) then why should it matter what I pay?    The wealth I attract does NOT come at the expense of someone else.  It's NOT a zero sum game.  I don't profit by someone else losing out on profits.  Money and wealth are additive and therefore multiplicative.    When I stopped believing in this sense of lack, I let go of my opposition to people selling these types of things.

aliens,35d97m,Deedubau,3,Sat May 9 13:24:55 2015 UTC,I've never heard of Treb but I love the things Bashar has to say. I honestly think what they say should be less about whether or not bsing people (channels will always be a controversial topic) and more about whether or not you learn anything useful from them.
aliens,35d97m,Deedubau,2,Sat May 9 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I ponder it sometimes though. Check out Treb though, he may be my favorite. The dude is one jolly reptilian."
aliens,35d97m,BoltWire,1 point,Sat May 9 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"I'll have to check it out because I rarely hear about benevolent reptillians, although it would be silly for me to think they all have the same beliefs since humans don't. I have my own thoughts about channelings, but I gave up on trying to talk about them with people a long time ago, unless they are already into it. Veronica Torres and the Elohim council is probably favorite one i've listened to so far. There's 2 full interviews of her on the itunes podcast channel and it's pretty fascinating to see how she (and other people) had no interest in this kind of thing and it kind of seemingly naturally happened over time because these people are supposedly destined to do these channelings."

aliens,35d97m,SpiritWolfie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:19:54 2015 UTC,"I personally connect and talk with both, Bashar and Treb. So, they are very real to me. I must say, being channeller, I believe it's never the entity itself you could be interacting with. It's always self-created version of that entity. And this applies to all interactions. You could be talking and acting for and as your best friend, but still it won't be exactly him, just your interpretation of him.  I'm aware the information I get from tuning to any vibration is always colored by my own current belief system. If you listen to anything twice, you will notice the difference, and that is the reflection of the changes within your own filters.  There is another aspect of this, which has not been shared here; major portion of the communication between beings goes on through emotions and resonance, which is 'tel-empathy'. And you will always receive what is relevant to you in the moment. This is how babies learn to talk... They first understand emotionally and later assign words, definitions, and relations to those emotions. So, the emotions and meanings you deny in yourself, will be invisible for you.  The emotion we deny most is love, thus we sometimes amplify the lack of love. We learn to trust the doubt of love instead of love because we were hurt and disappointed. And that way we allow experiences of lie and deception in our lives. That is in the fact just reflection of our unwillingness to love ourselves and fear of the judgement for being wrong.  Same as there's no offense, just self-defense, and offense can't be given, just taken, there's no real deception possible. You can only be deceived, if you agree to be deceived. And, you would only agree to be deceived, if you believed, getting deceived is more beneficial for you in the moment, than supposed alternative.  From that I assume, not insisting it must be so for you, you fear what they say could be actually true because you believe it would force you to change the approach to your life in uncomfortable way. If I may assume bit more, you fear to have the ultimate power over your life, because that would mean, you are directly responsible for all that happened to you."

aliens,35cbwd,losdospedro,1 point,Sun May 10 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"Well see there is a fundamental problem with your ""hopes"" to find something credible without giving up your sceptical rigor.   It's what most people do!, keep to science and sanity!   If something holding up to scrutiny should point clearly at amazing things about aliens it would make the world wide news!   There are thousands of brilliant people in the field theorising about life from other worlds, people working for SETI search for signals, other astronomers specialise in looking for places in the universe where life may be possible or plausible. Aliens are these peoples life passion and their work. They will not fail to take interest!, and you will not be the first one to hear about it on some obscure internet source! Really!!!  It is quite possible that there is truth to observations that are not able to stand up to scrutinising burden of evidence, I for one think NOT but it IS possible! The point is that is the definition of making it credible! If it is credible people will take notice!   So it has to be a coverup... Some government is keeping everything from everybody, some chosen entity of some one all mighty country keeps it secret, blocks all signs and evidence from all others, all other passionate people about this all over the globe, forcing everyone to never be able to share one single piece of credible evidence so as we must spread our non-confirmed enlightenment on secret channels of the anonymous internet. All the people world-wide who live for this.  Quite frankly that presumption is demented!   So what you are left with are interesting phenomenas that may have truth, most likely not but possibly, that will not hold up to your standard of rigor to ponder on. Else you would already know about it and so would everyone else who take interest.   As you can tell I'm wiling to take a shit-load of down votes too. This is obviously not a popular view here :)   But anyways what you can find is interesting observations or claims that may challenge your imagination and intellect and possibly some things that may suggest, without complete credibility, of unexplained thing possibly alien.That is all!"

aliens,35b95n,New_Y0rker,9,Fri May 8 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"Seriously that thread was an embarrassment to this subreddit. I feel bad for some of the people on there. It was getting cringey seeing him spam everyone's posts with ""check out my AMA"" etc  It was a giant pisstake. Anyone can just come out with  ""he choose me because I'm awesome, I know because I always picked the paragon options in Mass Effect!!"" and then grab random info from all the various sites and spew out some BS. Then confirm as real all the links and posts people reply with.   Nothing he was talking about was new. It was just some guy making a fool out of people.   I ranted about it before in the ""Is this subbreddit serious"" post. :     The subject of Alien life and question of if we have been visited is an immensely fascinating topic. However the field is often plagued by certain personalities that have a clearly unhealthy outlook on the world. The hardcore conspiracy types obsessed with notions of an Illuminati, faked moon landings, 9/11 being the aliens. Toxic types who listen to people like Alex Jones or David Ike. Everyone in power is a evil reptilian in disguise, digital artifacts in video streams proves that all these celebrities and news casters are actually evil reptilian aliens in disguise, NASA and the Cold War all being nothing but a show put on by the powers that be to keep us distracted from the ""real reptilian overlords truth"". Or worse, the ""all Aliens are actually Demons sent by Satan"" crowd. There a lot of what I deem physiologically unwell people utterly obsessed with this stuff and there a lot of charlatans who build careers out of feeding these people all this toxic, negative crap. Then there are those who just like to invent stuff for fun, or for their own mini social experiment. People start to treat a lot of this stuff like a religion or cult.   This kind of thing here is an example of why this can be such a fascinating topic.   However the highest rated post of all time on this subreddit is a pure, raw example unhealthy drivel that highly damages the entire subject of Aliens and UFO's being taking seriously by the people that matter.     People often wonder if there was intelligent Alien races interacting with our planet and watching us, why they have not revealed themselves yet. And there are many good theory's put forward about the dangers of breaking such news to a younger civilization too soon.  The above is yet another example of that. If these unhealthy view points and obsessive negative thinking can spawn from just the 'idea' of Aliens possibly visiting us. Imagine how bad it'd get if Aliens DID start opening interacting with our civilizations.   Just imagine how bad it'd potentially get with these people and how fast it could get out of hand and spread huge mistrust for these potential galactic allies.   It is ironic that  a large chunk of people who want ""the truth"" to come out could well be the very people delaying such an event if it was to happen.  The US Government appeared to be initially pretty open about the UFO phenomenon early on but very quickly became HIGHLY concerned with how off the wall some peoples reactions and hysterical ideas because to spread extremely quickly. Even to the point where they saw a potential weakness that could be exploited by the Soviets. It very quickly changed its policy and started covering up the more unexplainable events of this phenomenon as a result.   It would appear that there is huge lack of ability in many people to critically analyses and think for themselves and instead a desire to lap up and believe anything they hear that fits into a their narrative of a negative world view.     I've been reading tonnes and tonnes of this stuff for well over a decade and to be honest I find it highly concerning at times. I worry about these people going around believing such things, and how bad an impact that must be having on their outlook on life.  Nothing said in that thread is new information. Nothing. I could have easily made such a thread myself. You'll see it in plenty of forums out there ranging from racist sites like stormfront (the evil jews control the world and the evil reptilians control the jews) to your typical conspiracy sites like infowars and so on. The Above Top Secret forum/website has this kinda stuff going on too at times though they appear to clamp down on it a lot more.   None of this is new.      Anyway I stress the importance of putting massive wall up and separating the real core phenomena itself from this darker, unhealthy, negative and paranoid narrative that consume a lot of people out there. Though some of it can make an entertaining read. Its best to treat it like fan fiction or just stay away from it completely. But don't dismiss the ENTIRE idea of UFO's and Alien life because of that crap. In other words, a filter is needed to reading about this subject."
aliens,35b95n,Sisko-ire,2,Sat May 9 02:15:32 2015 UTC,"I like your take on things. Maybe you are right, we do need some way to filter these issues. However I do see this sub as a place where people can share experiences, stories, dreams/recollections or events that their family has went through in order to start a discussion instead of getting discredited. I think in essence /r/aliens provides a very healthy outlook and the majority of the time, and through reading most of the responses on here - people tend to call out when there's a far fetched idea, often times debunking it immediately.   ETs have been interacting with a very specific crowd since ancient times; usually awakened/open-minded individuals and that puts a different spin on the hard hitting facts. It has everything to do with our minds/memories which are such a deeply explorative space that we get lost in, barely knowing ourselves or being able to recall anything from our own past (let alone if it were intentional - consider that even our own governments/military have researched and enabled this technology for decades).  Anyways, you have a great point - but what I'm saying is; the documentaries, photos, articles & evidence gets reposted here all the time. We've seen it all. But alien life has everything to do with the mind & spirit world, and we're barely familiar with it as a species. Which is why we can't discredit the questions asked or stories people come to tell. It is what makes this sub special and gives people hope for a healthy open-minded discussion that they can not get anywhere else without being called crazy."
aliens,35b95n,sharkcock,4,Sun May 10 22:16:16 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with you almost 100%. And I don't tend to go around outright discrediting things on here. Hell I didnt even bother questioning the OP, who I could have decimated if I wanted. But the thread in question crossed a line and was manipulating people who were probably new to this topic, and most likely, all just for the OP's entertainment. It went too far.   If we have been visited by another form of intelligent life it'd be the most significant event in human history. Any intelligent person should wonder if such a thing could be true imo. If anything ever comes up that might indicate such a possibility might be true it should be taken seriously. VERY seriously.  But its not taken seriously. Instead its seen as a joke. Why? Because of bullshit artists conning weak minded people, desperate people and the mentally ill for decades. And its such a same. It shouldn't even BE a topic that anyone could call ""crazy"" to discuss, but it is. Because of people such as this. So on that I just have no time for. And why I feel concerned for those getting sucked in by it.   Often these deep crazy narratives about all the aliens and what they are up to... often leads to a very nightmarish negative world view, and I can't help but feel concerned for those who end up going around thinking this was how the world was.   But yeah I agree with you on everything else. Though :  ""ETs have been interacting with a very specific crowd since ancient times; usually awakened/open-minded individuals and that puts a different spin on the hard hitting facts.

I don't know if this is true or not myself. Only because I've not seen the information that would convicen me this was true... yet.  But I'm not denying it either. I just don't know.

aliens,3543sr,CallMeQuartz,3,Thu May 7 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"I'm reading a transcript of the Lacerta gal and while I'm totally open-minded to extraterrestrials living on this planet, the facts she's claiming just don't seem to add up scientifically or historically thus far.  I will watch/read the others and will let you know what I think."
aliens,3543sr,anonymous_being,3,Thu May 7 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"Why would you assume that whatever version of history you have been taught is flawless? As whole I think the Lacerta interviews are definitely plausible. The dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago, and we know that mammals were free to evolve since the top predators were gone. Why couldn't the smaller reptiles that walked on two legs also evolve into something with intelligence? They most certainly could."
aliens,3543sr,anonymous_being,5,Thu May 7 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"I agree that other species evolve just like us,  but to get where Lacerta says they are, technology wise, they would need to go through the many steps of civilization like we did and that would leave a LOT of evidence lying around including numerous skeletons, structures, garbage, etc., but there is none of that.  So....  I totally believe or am open-minded to ET's currently living on Earth amongst humans, but this one doesn't seem to add up even theoretically.    Who knows?  Maybe they miraculously cleaned up all traces of their existence before becoming star-born, but I doubt it.    Plus, you figure that they would have made official contact with humans when we were all simpler species if we've been living side-by-side for millions of years.  Those are just a few arguments that can be presented.  Sorry to be a negative Nancy.  I'd happily meet Lacerta or any of her kind in a safe, but public place if they'd like."
aliens,3543sr,CallMeQuartz,1 point,Thu May 7 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"No, it's totally alright to be a Negative Nancy, I'm not posting here to have people blindly agree with me or anything. I like looking at stories at multiple angles, from other individuals view points. It helps one get a broader view of a picture.    If Surians exist and they are just these demonized, evolved, subterranean, lizardfolk who are local to Earth, like Lacerta, then I would totally be okay with meeting one. I personally think that a negative view of Earth Born Surians (don't know about the supposed ET ones) have been propagated by the Judeo-Christian faiths and our primal fear of an supposed intelligent Apex Predator out there above us Homosapiens. I would be more okay with meeting one of them to converse with as apposed to the reported Doctor-lab rat relation we humans seem to have with most Grey entities.   Honestly, and this is super primal, but I would talk to anyone who wouldn't eat me."

aliens,3543sr,anonymous_being,1 point,Fri May 8 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"It's fine to be skeptic, but I feel like your reasoning is flawed. Any structures or garbage left behind could easily degrade in a fraction of the time since the saurians went underground. Go look up pictures of towns that have been abandoned for just 50 years, then imagine what can happen over a million years of weathering and erosion. Though it is certainly possible traces have been cleaned up by either them or the humanoid ETs. After all, why wouldn't an intelligent species respect the environment and give what they have taken back to nature? And we have found skeletons of their ancestors, but bones have been mixed up and reconstructions have been labeled as mere animals. Official contact could have already happened, for example there are legends of lizard people in Native American cultures. As for why they no longer walk the surface with us, that remains to be seen. I've postulated that there may be some kind of conflict between the saurians and the ETs, where the ETs allow the saurians to exist as long as they don't interfere with our growth. In fact Lacerta sort of hints at such a conflict."
aliens,3543sr,bazutti,5,Fri May 8 01:39:54 2015 UTC,"You make some good points.  However, I think that there would still be numerous structures, skeletons, artifacts, etc. of their existence remaining.  Anything is possible and I do believe that ET's are here, but I think Lacerta needs to be questioned by a historian and scientist."
aliens,3543sr,valdamirie,1 point,Fri May 8 04:19:43 2015 UTC,"I like the points she makes about ""the sphere's of influence"" and how they relate to PK, Telepathy, and such. I also like how she goes out of her way to state that Earth Birthed Reptillians/Surians are demonized as ""evil,"" and she states how ""evil"" is a state of perception from where one is standing, so to speak.   What I mean is: In her interview (and the other three), all of these supposed ""ETs"" make very interesting philosophical points, regardless if these individuals/entities existence or nonexistence. I found them all interesting none the less.   Also, I liked Lacerta's interview because she gives us a sort of anatomy lesson on the Surian race, which I would like to use as a sort of basic templet to cross reference with other Reptillian stories/reports/videos/experiences to see if there is any sort of common ""golden thread"" that connects them to one another, OR to show that Larceta's interview is bullshit."

However, ET's have every right to be religious, I guess, and send out missionaries just as we humans regrettably do amongst ourselves.  Anyway, I lost interest in that one once the god card was played.  I will read/watch the next."
aliens,3543sr,Deedubau,1 point,Thu May 7 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"Just a warning, The Airl ""Grey"" one gets borderline scientologist and becomes hard to digest, but an interesting listen none the less.

Even with that said, there are some decent philosophical points that are made in all three interviews, even though the interviews themselves might all just be bullshit."
aliens,3543sr,lobob123,3,Thu May 7 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"Borderline scientologist? From what I recall, it's pretty much what Hubbard said about souls being trapped and whatnot. Plus, the author, Lawrence Spencer, was a self-admitted scientologist for 31 years. So, it just so happens that the book he writes about an alien interview happens to have principles and teachings that are in line with his religion? And all the evidence of the interview was destroyed so we need to just take his word. Oh and the lady who did the interview is dead.  For as much as I'd love for any interview to be authentic, I'd have to say it's completely bogus."

aliens,3543sr,Molly-Millionz,3,Thu May 7 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"I've read the about the Lacerta one years ago and what she said was pretty fascinating to say the least. I don't remember the details of everything she said but some of the stuff she said supposedly turned about to be true years after this interview was done. Here's her interview for those of you who choose not to spend 2+ hours listening to something that may or may not even be true  http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_52.htm  As for Valiant Thor, I remember hearing about him when a woman who claimed she was from Venus was on springer and a man from the Pentagon claimed he worked with Valiant and debunked what she said about Venusians because it didn't match up with Valiant told about his home planet. You can youtube much shorter videos about him but basically he was a genuis with an incredibly high IQ who wanted to help human beings evolve to a higher consciousness and get rid of all the bad stuff but the government said no then he went back to his home planet.   As for the last video forget about it. There's no way in hell I'm going to spend 2 hours listening to a youtube video and the most I'd do is read for maybe 5 minutes. If anyone can sum that one up then that would be great."
aliens,3543sr,bumbo1,1 point,Thu May 7 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"I know it's a long one and may not be real, but It's an interesting topic. There are shorter versions on youtube, but yes, it does get a bit far fetched and hard to swallow. I totally understand if you want to TL:DR this one, but if you find it in yourself to look past the length, give it a once over and check it out, I would love to hear your thoughts. Other folks on here want a transcript of the Airl ""Grey"" interview opposed to the youtube video, if I can find just the print transcript and send you a link, would you still be interested in perusing it?"

I just don't want to take the time to watch long videos anymore because it's so time consuming and usually a rehash of something I've read before in other incidents. If you can find and link me to a transcript then sure I'll give it a read."
aliens,3543sr,AnnOtherOne,3,Fri May 8 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"You must understand that both species were interested in this young planet not for his biology and undeveloped species, but for only one reason: raw material, especially copper.  To understand this reason, you must know that copper is a very important material for some advanced species (even today) because it is - together with some unstable materials - able to produce new stable elements if you induce a high electromagnetic field in the right angle with a high nuclear radiation field to produce an over-crossing of fluctuating fields.  The fusion of copper with other elements in such a magnetic/radiation field-chamber can produce a force field of special nature that is very useful for various technological tasks (but the base for this is an extremely complex formula you are not able to discover because of the restrictions of your simple mind.)  Both species wanted to have the copper of Planet Earth and for this reason they fought a not very long war in space and orbit. The humanoid species seemed to be successful during the first time, but in a last battle the reptilians decided to use a mighty experimental weapon - a special kind of fusion bomb which should destroy the life forms on the planet but should not harm the valuable raw materials and the copper.   So we're to believe that aliens who are so powerful they can cross dimensions fought over Earth for copper when there is literally trillions and trillions of planets with unlimited resources on it?  This story does not make sense at all and sounds extremely fraudulent."

To plant seeds in our popular culture so when we do see them, we can relate.... And not just fall to the ground in terror. Seems like a good idea to me... If I was an alien...

aliens,352lyx,BarbarianSasquatch,1 point,Thu May 7 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Going off that line of thinking, I have been pondering this question as of late: ""Does anyone else notice how the media in America go out of their way to paint ""The Greys'"" in a positive light as much as possible?""     EI: 1) Paul 2) Stargate SG-1 3) Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Funny that Spielburg directed that, E.T. and had a hand in M.I.B.)   The Greys don't give me a particular warm fuzzy feeling (maybe because all the supposed mutilations and blood letting), and there seem to be less films where The Greys are nabbing people and not bringing them back (Which happens more than we would like to admit in the UFO community.)   IE: 1) The Fourth Kind 2) Dark Skies   Neither of these last two films listed made a lot of money at the box office. (I don't count ""Signs"" or ""Independence Day"" they aren't exactly Grey-ish in my opinion. (maybe my movie knowledge is more limited than I think))  What I am getting at is: America is VERY good at dishing out propaganda and I feel that those movies that show Greys as space environmentalists here to save us from ourselves might be kinda....well....Propaganda-y in my opinion. I do agree that we need to be saved from ourselves, but we need to save OURSELVES by our own volition, not because an outside force steps in and goes, ""Hey....that's bad. Quit it."" We should know the crazy violent shit we do to each other as upright hominids is sorta (very) fucked up.   I'm not trying to be tinfoil hat man, but look at it this way: IF the American Government has been working with Greys since 1947 and IF the American Government's agenda differs from those of the American people (allowing Greys to experiment on Abductees in exchange for tech secrets), would it really be such a stretch to believe that said Government would release movies to get us both desensitized to the idea ETs (which I agree with and don't think is necessarily ""bad"") and telling us that our salvation lies with The Greys?

It was the video that I show my more skeptical friends to get them thinking, and I posted it for the same reasons here."

Twenty years after any involvement with the Canadian government.  Perhaps he has just gone a bit mad in his old age.  In any case he is certainly trying to hold on to being relevant, or important.  Old people get weird at a certain age.  There are tons of politicians who have claimed to see UFOs, etc.  Plenty of CIA guys, astronauts, and even presidents of the USA.  Why in the fuck do people feel it is necessary to put up Paul fucking nut job hellyer on this sub every two days.  It is almost as insane as the guy himself.

He tends to use passive language like ""it is said"" and ""many agree that"" (persuasion tactics used by quacks of all shades). However, I think what puts Hellyer in a different category than other folks who make similar claims is the fact that he's not at a UFO convention, he's not making a PSA, he's not giving a lecture to astrobiologists, he's not on Ancient fucking Aliens, he's speaking in front of his peers and colleagues with little to gain (as far as I can see). If he did this all for publicity, as some last desperate gasp of relevancy as his career (and his life) come to a close, he won the game.

Backed by documents newly declassified through the Freedom of Information Act, Colonel Philip J. Corso (Ret.), a member of President Eisenhower’s National Security Council and former head of the Foreign Technology Desk in the US Army, has come forward to reveal his personal stewardship of alien artifacts from the Roswell crash. He tells us how he spearheaded the Army’s reverse-engineering project that led to today’s integrated circuit chips, fiber optics, lasers, and super-tenacity fibers, and “seeded” the Roswell alien technology to giants of American industry. Laying bare the US government’s shocking role in the Roswell incident—what was found, the cover-up, and how they used alien artifacts to change the course of twentieth-century history—The Day After Roswell is an extraordinary memoir that not only forces us to reconsider the past, but also our role in the universe.""  -taken straight from Amazon"

There is also what looks like a fuzzy wolf's head next to the girder support behind the head of the mummy.  The blanket is arranged tastefully like a scarf around the neck of the head of the mummy as well. Totally a museum piece.    I think it is reprehensible that Maussan, Schmitt, Dolan et al tried to defraud the public on the basis of this clearly non-extraterrestrial slide.   The leaked blurry one looked more like an alien!"
aliens,34z0vb,ruffthesuspect,2,Wed May 6 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I didn't notice it during the telecast but that ancient relic of a blanket isn't army-issued. And, yeah, there's another placard for another item.  I'm actually someone who would argue against the case that it is a mummy just because it ""looks like one,"" but I would then argue it WAS a mummy because of the blanket."

Let me tell you guys, i'm spanish first language and I can tell you that Jaime Maussan  is a fucking joke. that guy would believe a picture of a pencil thrown in the air is a space craft full of aliens on its way to blow earth up.  Its pretty fucking obvious this is a child mummy ffs just look at the pictures of the museum. It even has the same name tag outside of the body.  This is how fucking thirsty the ufo community is that, you take one slide that some what resembles an alien.. and you make a 5 hour paid broadcast to which only maybe 7 minutes is worth your time.  They beat the dead horse so much it fucking came back to live and was beat up again.  This Jaime Maussan would always go and push the other scientists into saying.. ohh.. is not of human nature.. then the dumb koolaid audience would clap.  Mexico is golable as shit. they believe virgin marie shows up on trees and that statues cry. This was embarrasing and cringe worthy to watch and it hurts the ufo community so fucking much.  If you wanna see a real alien.. then go see ivan0135 or w/e his name is on youtube. that shit is more believable than this shiet.  at the end they made the alien on CGI and made him WALK and WAVE!!!!  fUCK!"

aliens,34z0vb,A_Bitter_Barista,18,Tue May 5 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else here I am supremely skeptical about the way this is being presented.  But since this is the /aliens sub, we might as well discuss theories about the contents of the slides.  Personally, I think that it looks consistent with a picture of a preserved child mummy.  Some researchers even suggest that it can be nailed down to a specific museum holding (Wistar 2397).   Other points that support a more earthly / mundane origin:  -How would the Rays gain access to a secret facility and snap pictures, when other more credible researchers and politicians were allegedly denied access (such as Senator Barry Goldwater, who was a Major General with connections).  -Is the preservation method shown in the slides consistent with how alien bodies would have been stored?  I would imagine they would be put in a cryogenic freezer to preserve tissue, and used only for biological research.  Not propped up in a clear glass case for tourists!. The UFO coverup narrative is predicated on the government RESTRICTING who could see material. Not putting it on display, even 'internally'.  Anybody who has been in military security or intelligence would know this is inconsistent with how things work in real life.  Hell, even at Area 51, they keep top secret cleared employees in the dark about other teams projects!  -Why is there what looks like a white placard contained next to the body?  Not consistent with a specimen that would be the subject of intense scientific study, but more like a tourist display in a museum."
aliens,34z0vb,A_Bitter_Barista,9,Wed May 6 00:13:59 2015 UTC,Great analysis.  The whole circus show atmosphere around these slides makes believe it is complete bull.  The way they are trying to make money off of this tells me the owners of the slides know the hoopla surrounding them will be short lived.
aliens,34z0vb,shen-han,1 point,Tue May 5 19:51:26 2015 UTC,I think it's a mummy or corpse of a dead child as well. It's in a glass case and preserved with a placard and blanket. There's a woman in the reflection taking the photo.  I believe these guys either were fools and got fooled or are purposely scamming people
aliens,34z0vb,vonsmall,14,Tue May 5 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Was 50/50 on this like anyone should be, until I found out about the ""$20 live stream pay wall"" All that waiting for an imminent stream of bullshit."
aliens,34z0vb,shen-han,5,Fri May 8 07:56:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like it's going to be a documentary that a lot of time, effort, and money went into. It appears they also went through the effort of getting a bunch of panelists on, so they probably hope to get some sort of return on it, even if it is simply breaking even. That doesn't mean it's fake, but it doesn't mean it's real. It is too early to tell. I'd recommend waiting for the torrent to come out, which is what I am going to do. Keep an open mind."
aliens,34z0vb,shen-han,4,Tue May 5 19:26:33 2015 UTC,Word. I'll remain open minded. The guy did say he would like SOME financial involvement to at least break even on the time/money/effort which is fair I guess. But people have pulled this shit too many times already for profit. And on the 20 year anniversary of that other famous hoax? Suspicious. It would be a damned shame.
aliens,34z0vb,Tremendousdread,9,Tue May 5 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"tbh, it looks like a mummified child. They keep making comparisons to an adult male human and saying how the proportions are all wrong. And they would be... it makes me suspicious that they don't make a comparison to a child. Not even once. It's like they know, but are hoping nobody else will notice.  The comments about lack of mammary glands is silly. This is a completely dessicated mummy, it doesn't have even skin, for the most part. I don't know why they went there. Again, it's like they know so they're bringing up irrelevancies instead of saying what appears to be the case: It has the proportions and characteristics of a human CHILD that has been mummified via dessication, such as in the desert. ...Am I missing something?  Edit: Even their animation (running as I type), having intentionally made it spooky by making it blue and not putting any skin over the eye sockets to make them look ginormous, even with all that, it still looks exactly like a two to three year old child, doesn't it?  Edit 2: Further comparison: Roswell Slide alien to child mummy."
aliens,34z0vb,shen-han,5,Tue May 5 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the child mummy theory. It looks a lot like the Mummy child displayed at the Museum of the Capuchins, Palermo, Italy. Although many of the Museums mummys were destroyed by allied bombers during 1940, that does not mean all of them, and to assume - if some did survive they would have been put on display to attract attention (and money to rebuild the devastation)... This kind of loosely fits in with this family touring Europe, some of the other slides are or Paris, not a big step then to hop over to Italy.  EDIT: This is complete speculation on my part though so please no flames! I've just seen so much hoax shit in the last decade(s) I don't trust anything without complete proof. This ""Slides"" topic I am extremely suspicious of as being just another deluded hoax. Maybe not a nefarious one, perhaps the person just want to believe so much they convinced themselves."
aliens,34z0vb,Tremendousdread,3,Wed May 6 04:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are a few of these around. I saw one at a tourist trap several years ago outside of Tucson, Arizona. Coincidentally, the next day I was in Sedona, Arizona (source of the slides) to investigate the psychic vortex there.  The thing that raised red flags for me is how they kept comparing the mummy to an adult male skeleton and showing how different the proportions of the mummy were.  It seemed obvious that since the mummy looked like a child to begin with, at least part of their presentation (if they weren't being disingenuous from the start) would have been to compare the mummy to a human child skeleton, to show us how it was different... if it was different at all.  The fact that they never did that one super obvious thing in their long, drawn-out sell-job made me think that they knew or suspected that it was the mummy of a child. Whatever the reason, they were working extra hard to stay away from that point."
aliens,34z0vb,shen-han,1 point,Wed May 6 12:56:16 2015 UTC,"Well, there was the testimony of that paleontologist (or anthropologist?) that said the rib pairs were greater than a normal human and that the metacarpals were different."
aliens,34z0vb,Tremendousdread,5,Wed May 6 16:57:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you can't really see all the ribs, or the metacarpals at all, as far as I can tell. It looks like he was making an inference. It was hard to tell, but it seemed like he was saying this based on relative positions on an adult. But if you made that comparison to a child, which is what it looks like, would you still think they were different?  I don't know.... It was weird that they never did that, considering it looks like a child mummy. Someone up thread posted some images of museum mummies of children that look exactly like this one.  EDIT: Not one of the ones posted by the previous poster, but this has been all over the place: http://www.blueblurrylines.com/2015/03/is-this-mummy-famous-alien-in-roswell.html   ...I've tried doing a side by side comparison and I really don't see the difference (other than this one being in SLIGHTLY better condition). And again, I found it odd in a semi-scummy way that they made comparisons over and over to an adult male (human) but never a child. It looks like a child mummy - 100 percent like the others that have been posted, so if it isn't a child mummy then why not clear it up by showing us why it isn't, you know? And if they don't want to do that, then that tells me that they know damn well it's a child mummy and are trying to hide that from their audience."
aliens,34z0vb,bobjoefrank,2,Wed May 6 04:29:14 2015 UTC,There are many many mummies like that one. I'm sure there's one that will match perfectly to the slide. Because that is a human mummified child. It's not an alien :( scumbag people trying to rip everyone off
aliens,34z0vb,austinl91,1 point,Wed May 6 05:44:58 2015 UTC,"Here's something really sick I didn't mention before: I downloaded the highest resolution ""alien"" mummy pic you find here. It's 1200 pixels wide (~1Mpixel) and ran it through Photoshop. It only takes a couple of tweaks to see that there are words on the museum card that goes with the mummy.  With the size available online, the letters on the card are only about 1.5 pixels tall; not big enough to be readable. But the slide itself will have around 24Mpixels of data, making the card VERY readable.  So either they didn't do that obvious and easy thing, or they did, and decided to pretend it wasn't readable anyway (because they'd have no show otherwise). So are they ultra-stupid or ultra-scummy? The world wonders..."
aliens,34z0vb,Deedubau,2,Fri May 8 08:04:00 2015 UTC,Here's something else. If you look close there are son off things like the shelf it's missing a shadow where the bracket is. There  also seems to be  a chair that looks like it goes into the wall. It's possible it's something to do with the reflection  but who knows.  Not to mention the brackets and the woman's dress seems to be from 1955 or newer
aliens,34z0vb,codefreak8,1 point,Fri May 8 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"The bracket is odd but I think people are thrown off by the fact that it's a double display case. In other words, the bracket is in the middle; the near side has the mummy and the far side has other stuff. Also, they may have actually taken this trip in the late 50's. The Kodachrome analysis only dates the printing to prior to 1961, I think. The manufacture date was in the 40's but that doesn't really mean anything.   There are definitely other items on display. There is an animal head and a snake or something like that in the far side of the display case (which as I said is a double case. The mummy is closest to the camera. A second matching case is on the other side of the white bracket and that's where the animal head and snake are located. The woman in the dress is probably the one they talked about as the original owner and the photographer is that woman's husband. It's just a museum or sideshow display, as far as anyone can tell; a relic of the couple's European vacation like the rest of the slides.  Nobody would think otherwise except for the scam."

It would be great to have substantive verifiable data surrounding the slides.  Just for added credibility.

aliens,34z0vb,Kazooguru,3,Wed May 6 03:02:04 2015 UTC,My official opinion is this:  It is inconclusive. There is nothing to show that this is not a child mummy as other users have pointed out.
aliens,34z0vb,austinl91,2,Wed May 6 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"This is the most charitable conclusion, yes. I'd like to think that at least they believed they really had an alien. However, I have to point out (again) that they scrupulously avoided showing their illustrations of the mummy compared to a human child. They only compared it to an adult.  Am I the only one bothered by the fact that they didn't make this obvious assessment?  Since it looks like a child mummy to pretty much everyone, it seems like a no-brainer that the first thing they should do is explain why it isn't a human child but an alien. They never did that, which seemed like deliberate and calculated avoidance.  For what it's worth, I absolutely believe in advanced extraterrestrial life. I think that proof will come - but this show looked every bit like a hoax or scam and nothing like actual evidence to me."

aliens,34z0vb,TotallyNotAKoala,4,Wed May 6 04:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I realized that. And that's a good thing. But not being fake doesn't make it an alien. It looks like a mummified child. Elsewhere in this thread, someone posted pictures of child mummies in museums and they look exactly like this one. It doesn't mean it's that, either, but when you look at them, you won't see a difference.  EDIT: Not what they other person posted, but there's this: http://www.blueblurrylines.com/2015/03/is-this-mummy-famous-alien-in-roswell.html  ...again, tbh, I don't see  the difference. They kept making skeletal comparisons to an adult human and seemed to avoid comparing the mummy in the slide to a child. And that was suspicious - like they knew and hoped nobody would notice."
aliens,34z0vb,TheFlashFrame,1 point,Wed May 6 04:56:02 2015 UTC,"Some of them have some mummified skin over the eye sockets and some don't. The alien mummy DOES have some, though (not a full set of eyelids but some skin) - it's just that their graphic simulations of the face didn't have it (to make it look more alien I guess).    If you look here - The last photo of the mummy series toward the bottom IS the one from the show last night. It looks exactly like the one above it, which is a getty images photo of a child mummy. Like I said, they made some.... ""adjustments"" when they did their simulations and 3 d rendering models.  The one above was posted last night - this guy did an even more thorough job taking apart the ""alien"" mummy. His photo enhancements show other museum items which can be seen in the photo, including a gorilla head."
aliens,34z0vb,austinl91,1 point,Wed May 6 05:32:40 2015 UTC,"I understand. I really wanted this to be something, too! So I think we're trying too hard to make an alien out of a mummy- because some guys made a lot of money off of telling us that's what it was.  But besides the fact that it really looks like a mummy in a museum in the photo (but not in their graphic recreations), the two slides came from a batch of slides a couple took when they visited Europe on vacation. There was never any connection to Roswell that anyone can point to. Yeah, they might have been around there at some point - so have I. Might have, but they were definitely in Europe visiting museums and all the other slides support that. If it wasn't for some people making up a story about how these two slides are an alien and not vacation pictures like all the rest of them were, we wouldn't give it a second thought."
aliens,34z0vb,BarbarianSasquatch,3,Wed May 6 05:34:25 2015 UTC,"It looks really similar to a picture of a mummified child from an exhibit I once saw.

aliens,34z0vb,austinl91,3,Wed May 6 12:01:29 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the one to point these things out, but (1) if this is one of the extraterrestrial entities known as ""The Greys,"" that crashed in 1947 in Roswell....then where are the stereotypical, long, fully articulated three fingers that one hears about in case studies and abduction reports? In the slide provided, one can clearly see it has short stubby fingers, like that of a humanoid child, and a set of digits that exceeds the known three. (2) From supposed reports, the short ""Greys"" are supposedly android-like constructs in which the tall ""Mantis-Greys"" use to project their consciousness into and control like a sort of worker drone. Now, with that being said, the slide provided clearly shows an entity with a human ribcage to house two lungs and a heart. If it were an android-like tool, or a even a biological ET, why would it have the same bone structure as a human child? (3) If this were an ET, why would those who have it in their possession display it on what looks like a second rate museum shelf, complete with mirrored backing and an information card? (4) Speaking of the mirrored backing; if one takes a look at this slide in a better resolution, you can see there is a reflection of what looks like a conservatively dressed woman or girl. The clothes she is wearing look like a school girl, or perhaps a nun leading a catholic school group on a field trip. Either way, I don't think that the possessor of an ET cadaver would just throw it up on display in this particular fashion to let just anyone see it.  Don't get me wrong, I believe in the ET phenomenon 100%, but I personally feel like that the slide given is in fact not the ""smoking gun"" we were promised."

Chances are the alien was locked up in a cell and subjected to crazy and torturous experiments. Considering that was over sixty years ago, the alien by now is either dead, gone completely insane, or maybe even discovered a way to escape but soon died in the wilderness (those aliens seem like they'd be pretty helpless without their technology).

His dead counterpart would've been autopsied to see what we could find out about their biology.

Especially with topics like this which are almost impossible to really discuss seriously without seeming like a loon.  I've been reading books about the subject since I was a child, I listen to as many researchers as possible. I try to keep up in UFO sightings to help shed light on what is natural/explainable and what is not. I'm still not sure if I really believe, but regardless humanity has been -very- interesting in ETs since early in our history.  There are people in this world who seek only to exploit others, so you should always take what people say with a grain of salt. But with that said - ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it"" Aristotle  Regardless of which theory for aliens you subscribe too, they all contain a very similar trait. That is a powerful elite of this planet are few and they control every aspect of society. Or at the very least try their hardest. With technology you can assume our gov'ts are at the very least 50-60 years ahead of what we're shown. We only see what we're shown and told about.  People don't have time to consider the truths of this world when they're constantly bombarded with fear mongering and propaganda. Bills to pay, mouths to feed. Wars we don't to be a part of to fight.   If you want something easy to digest, I suggest checking out a podcast like  The Higherside Chats. The interviewer is very good and covers a wide variety of topics, a lot of which involves ETs.

Now THAT'S f***ing scary.  Romanek wasn't the first guy they've done this too and he won't be the last.  I haven't made up my mind about Romanek entirely though.

He could have coincidentally been moving his hand at the same time the pen flew into the air. I fiddle with my hands many times in the exact same fashion. Furthermore, you don't explain the hundreds of other pieces of evidence he has to offer. Can you explain the documented UFO sightings with witnesses, the alien implants, the documented government attack in which another citizen actually chased the SUV in question? How about the mysterious workmen that came to take down his siding without permission and wouldn't let him take any part of it (not to mention the business did not exist)?. You need to look at his experiences as a whole instead of trying to discredit his individual weaker pieces of evidence. Additionally, there are literally DOZENS of cases where child pornography has been planted on a computer. As a networking major, I can't even begin to explain to you how easy it would be to perform.

aliens,34vr4o,ghostdate,1 point,Thu May 7 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I've never really seen any evidence of many of his claims. There's the shitty window alien video, that looks fake and could easily be faked.  It's been a while since I've delved into his story much, but I just remember getting a very phoney vibe off of him and him making a lot of claims that he couldn't back up. That pen flicking video, you can see it come from his hands, over his head and then come down, his reaction to it is very similar to a child trying to play dumb to a situation. Everything about the guy makes me skeptical of him, and I haven't seen good enough proof of any of his claims. Sure he may be witness to some UFOs, but even that can just be misidentification.   I'll also say I wasn't surprised when he got caught with child pornography. He just gives off pedo vibes.  Edit: Okay, so I watched the whole thing to see what I thought about it now. I'm still skeptical of a lot of this. Some of his UFO footage looks like something that could be made easily, like the blinking orb one really just takes a blinking light in a helium filled balloon. It didn't make any wild movements, it just seemed to float on. There was a lot of instances in this presentation where he showed stills of a video he claims to have, but then never showed the video, which makes me skeptical of what we're seeing. Same with the instances where he played audio from a video, but didn't show the video itself. Why go through the trouble of separating the files, when it would be more concrete to show the whole thing?   With the window alien, he claims you can see eye-shine from the infra-red, which would suggest it's a living thing, but I didn't see any eye-shine. Maybe some light reflection, but it looked like it was coming off of a glossy surface, not reflecting from a retina. It looks very puppet-like in its motion. The grandpa grey looked very puppet like in the stills he showed, but why didn't he show the video for that?   He makes claims that people in a black SUV stopped him and beat him up, and we should believe it because the police showed up and someone chased the guys, according to Stan, there's no police report, or witness accounts, just Stan's claim. It's stuff like that which I can't buy. He easily could have fallen off of his bike and broke his nose, or maybe didn't break anything at all. If he were trying to perpetuate a long standing hoax, then he would probably be willing to put on fake bandages for the story.   With the house siding guys, again, he claims that their business name is whatever he said, and the number is whatever he said, we can't verify if it's real or not, because apparently it doesn't exist. For all anyone knows he called them himself and just harassed them with a camera for a bit and made up the story. He acts like the fact that they're not wanting to talk to him is an indicator of nefarious deeds. If that dude started pestering me while I was trying to work, I'd probably try to avoid talking to him as well. Again, no footage of them shop-vaccing the lawn, but honestly it wouldn't be too weird, if they were trying to vacuum scraps of siding and nails and so on so nobody gets nails in their feet.  The camera shots of the close up alien faces look like photos of photos...  The dead grass rings can easily be achieved with weed killer. It will kill grass too, and you can make patterns with it. He showed no evidence of the meteor dust, just claimed it was there.   Admittedly the knee thing was interesting, but we don't really have evidence that the person he's claiming is a doctor is really a doctor, could be someone complicit in his charade, like his abduction-mistresses. Can't see the document he shows in the presentation to see what it says, or if it's authentic, so I'm skeptical, but intrigued by this part.  The Audrey voice thing just happens to sound exactly like a standard text-to-speech voice in Windows? That's not at all suspect.   The girl in his yard photo kind of looked like there was just a cut-out photo of a girls face stuck to the deck railing. It didn't look like a real 3d object was there, but I can't say for certain either way. Could be easily faked is all I'm thinking.   EVPs I don't really buy. It's easy to misinterpret sounds as voices, and it's easy to make sounds into a recorder and claim you didn't hear it at the time. The whole EVP field is suspect to me.  His equations, like the element 115, were actually around before he wrote it, they just hadn't actually made it yet. A lot of these equations would have been easy to discover on the internet circa 2002-2006 when most of this was going on. There's no reason he couldn't just memorize them for later writing. The ones he claims physicists are still figuring out...well, we don't really know that for certain. Another instance of just taking Stan's word for it, when he doesn't seem like the most trustworthy guy to me.  The alien kids calling him on the phone sounded like adults trying to sound like kids, so I wouldn't be surprised if his abduction-mistresses were helping Stan in his charade.  Audrey telling him that his wife shouldn't quit her job, and the his wife's boss getting fired is just another story. No evidence of a boss, no evidence of anyone getting fired, no disclosure of work location so people can try to verify the claim themselves.   The ghost shadows in his home were eerily similar to other photos I've seen in the past of black masses in people's homes, including the mass having a shadow. The other photos I saw were deemed hoaxes, so I can't help but think that of Stan's photos of black masses as well.  In my opinion, a lot of what he provides is explainable as hoaxing or misunderstanding, and there's a lot of claims that don't even really have evidence. It's just stories. I'm just going to say I'm skeptical of him, and nothing he's shown has been convincing. The one thing that was really interesting to me was the shot of the orb coming over his house, because it illuminated his roof and lawn as it came over, so it would have to be pretty bright, definitely not a bug or something like that. I could see how a device could be rigged up for it though."
aliens,34vr4o,ghostdate,3,Wed May 6 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you watched the video. All the evidence is there but like Stan said in the beginning, he could do a one week presentation if he had to. All of the evidence is there.   Okay, so I watched the whole thing to see what I thought about it now. I'm still skeptical of a lot of this. Some of his UFO footage looks like something that could be made easily, like the blinking orb one really just takes a blinking light in a helium filled balloon. It didn't make any wild movements, it just seemed to float on.    All the witness eye testimony was there. It would be plausible to fake the UFO videos if other people hadn't seen them, but that isn't the case here.   With the window alien, he claims you can see eye-shine from the infra-red, which would suggest it's a living thing, but I didn't see any eye-shine. Maybe some light reflection, but it looked like it was coming off of a glossy surface, not reflecting from a retina. It looks very puppet-like in its motion. The grandpa grey looked very puppet like in the stills he showed, but why didn't he show the video for that?   The video is shown in another documentary.   He makes claims that people in a black SUV stopped him and beat him up, and we should believe it because the police showed up and someone chased the guys, according to Stan, there's no police report, or witness accounts, just Stan's claim. It's stuff like that which I can't buy. He easily could have fallen off of his bike and broke his nose, or maybe didn't break anything at all. If he were trying to perpetuate a long standing hoax, then he would probably be willing to put on fake bandages for the story.   It happened. There were witnesses, which is exactly why one of them chased the car. Why it wasn't shown? Again, he had just under two hours to report literally years of evidence.   With the house siding guys, again, he claims that their business name is whatever he said, and the number is whatever he said, we can't verify if it's real or not, because apparently it doesn't exist. For all anyone knows he called them himself and just harassed them with a camera for a bit and made up the story. He acts like the fact that they're not wanting to talk to him is an indicator of nefarious deeds. If that dude started pestering me while I was trying to work, I'd probably try to avoid talking to him as well. Again, no footage of them shop-vaccing the lawn, but honestly it wouldn't be too weird, if they were trying to vacuum scraps of siding and nails and so on so nobody gets nails in their feet.   He could've called them, but he probably didn't. Why would he want something replaced if it had all of this supposed evidence on it? How was the warped siding created in the first place?   The dead grass rings can easily be achieved with weed killer. It will kill grass too, and you can make patterns with it. He showed no evidence of the meteor dust, just claimed it was there.   This does not explain the strange electromagnetic field within the ring.   The girl in his yard photo kind of looked like there was just a cut-out photo of a girls face stuck to the deck railing. It didn't look like a real 3d object was there, but I can't say for certain either way. Could be easily faked is all I'm thinking.   Unfortunately, pictures of aliens and this girl are not the best. What is good, is this picture of one of his daughters at one of his conferences. She called him days before saying that she might be able to show up. Well, she did. At the end of the conference she ran up to him with some flowers and ran away. Witnesses have seen this as well.    Admittedly the knee thing was interesting, but we don't really have evidence that the person he's claiming is a doctor is really a doctor, could be someone complicit in his charade, like his abduction-mistresses. Can't see the document he shows in the presentation to see what it says, or if it's authentic, so I'm skeptical, but intrigued by this part.   This is one of my favorite parts as well, and I agree it does need show more documentation.    The ghost shadows in his home were eerily similar to other photos I've seen in the past of black masses in people's homes, including the mass having a shadow. The other photos I saw were deemed hoaxes, so I can't help but think that of Stan's photos of black masses as well.   So, I understand you think this is a hoax, but there are people who literally dedicate their lives to investigating this sort of thing, and I highly doubt these paranormal researchers would be there if they thought he was messing around with them.   His equations, like the element 115, were actually around before he wrote it, they just hadn't actually made it yet. A lot of these equations would have been easy to discover on the internet circa 2002-2006 when most of this was going on. There's no reason he couldn't just memorize them for later writing. The ones he claims physicists are still figuring out...well, we don't really know that for certain. Another instance of just taking Stan's word for it, when he doesn't seem like the most trustworthy guy to me.   We're talking about a guy who is completely dyslexic and cannot read nor do math above a 4th grade level. There is absolutely no way he could've figured out the equations let alone draw them. Physicists in this video and others testify this is graduate level work. This dude hasn't even gone to college. Also, his child was found drawing the symbols, how does one explain that?  On top of it all, one thing that you don't talk about is the alien implants. This is nearly impossible to hoax as even the scientists didn't know what it is or how it got formed.  Finally, this isn't nearly all the evidence that he has. I'll say it once more, this was a two hour presentation that should've been a week."
aliens,34vr4o,kanata665,2,Wed May 6 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"Id need to see this extra evidence, just saying it exists isn't really good enough for me.  And again there's lots of situations where he makes claims that other people were there. Doesn't mean he wasn't tricking them, or that they weren't in on it.  I also don't really trust his claims that he can't do math or write above a fourth grade level. It's one of those things where you can't really get evidence without compliance, but he would never comply, you know? He seems to make a lot of situations for himself where you can't necessarily prove or disprove anything.  I'd need to see this week long presentation's worth of evidence, because I've heard plenty of things, like the same spelling errors Stan is known for showing up in documents he claims were sent to him, and his claims that his alien video could only be reproduced for $50,000, when a paranormal research team managed to do it on $90 budget. Too much controversy for me to believe."

aliens,34vr4o,MrExperience,3,Tue May 5 06:02:38 2015 UTC,"The thing that really makes me believe he's authentic is when he got attacked by the men in the black suv. There were witnesses (one actually chased the car), injuries, and a filed police report. The other thing I think is crazy is the undercover operation to remove the siding from his home. The business and phone number listed on the truck did not exist! The work men also wouldn't let him take away any of the UFO affected siding either. Also, his knee got completely healed! There is no way at all that he could've faked that."

aliens,34spox,Ascurtis,2,Mon May 4 23:26:00 2015 UTC,"If anything ""confirmed"" it, the story would be much bigger than what it is. You have to admit though, it's pretty tough to beat a polygraph based solely on a dream or delusion. I'm sure the guy questions himself every single day of his life, surely his wife does too. Hooking him up to a polygraph makes the whole ordeal pretty intimidating. The sequence of events in his story are unusual, and for someone who wanted to ""fake it"" he would have picked a better narrative that would be easier to believe. I think the guy is genuine, but that's just my gut feeling on this encounter."
aliens,34spox,Ascurtis,3,Wed May 6 09:55:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply that he's making it up to deceive us. I'm saying he believes it happened so completely that he essentially would not be lying if he were to be asked if the event really happened, because to him it did happen.

We wouldn't be allowed into a 'galactic society' unless we become more loving caring and selfless.  I think the ones who are ready for open contact are the ones who are accepting of others.   As a whole though we are too dangerous to be let out into the galaxy.    If there is a galactic society out there, I can just imagine some officials being like.. ""hmm is it time to let the Earthlings into our society?  Well judging by the last 100 years they are making some progress but they are still killing and fighting each other every day.

I know that's not really evidence or anything, but it is interesting to me. Both times were when I wasn't expecting anything, and didn't have an anxiety or fear or anticipation of seeing something. Every other time there's been a lingering anxiety in the back of my mind, and I feel like maybe a lot of people that try this technique also have that lingering fear, whether they're consciously aware of it or not. It's hard to get rid of that fear, and intentionally trying to devoid myself of it is almost impossible.

There's ~8 billion people here, I doubt they'd get all of us. It would be a change, and a drastic one. We will adapt.

Some of us are ready.. the ones who are selfless and caring.. but most of us are not.  also.. if I were a member of a very advanced benevolent civilization, I would do my best to block contact with the people of earth and quarantine them to at least their own solar system. I'd probably fake the data of SETI so that they don't make contact.  Maybe that's why we see no signs of life elsewhere in the universe... maybe contact is aleady being blocked."

He simply says ""I can't talk about it"", or ""they tell us to say that"". Now, he's basically stating that he has top secret meetings in the situation room about UFO's but can't admit to it.   GGG Barack Obama. Wants to let you know aliens exist, but can't completely admit it."
aliens,34rx01,SatanTheBodhisattva,2,Mon May 4 04:53:54 2015 UTC,He's maybe just being sarcastic? He knows that's what people are expecting him to say.

If he says yes, people would freak out and that would have wide-reaching consequences, even if he was just joking. If he says no, he might be proven wrong in the future even if he doesn't have evidence now. People would think he lied. If he says, I don't know, some people would think he is lying and others would question his competence. You are the President and you don't know? WTF. If he says, I can neither confirm or deny that makes him look like he is hiding something and reeks of conspiracy but doesn't have the same effects of #3 and it could be interpreted as I don't know, as well. #4 is the logical response."

aliens,34rx01,codyxpine,2,Wed May 6 07:03:46 2015 UTC,"The simple answer to the ""I can't talk about it"" is that the UFO sightings are often military test craft and that some of the UFO lore was planted and encouraged by the government to cover up this fact. We basically know that this is true but isn't something the president can really talk about since it is classified and part of national security. There could also be some cases that even the government is baffled by and again would mean he can't really tall about it."
aliens,34rx01,LulzMacky,2,Sun May 10 10:16:57 2015 UTC,I agree. I think Obama just has a good natured sense of humor. I don't think he thinks about the fact that people are going to hang on his every word an over analyze everything he says. As he shouldn't. He's amusing himself. Being the president is a bigger job than any of us could imagine and I'm sure he has plenty of stuff to focus on.

aliens,34kak0,ArdRi_,5,Sat May 2 17:20:17 2015 UTC,I feel genuinely bad for your naivety.   You seriously think that if this footage was authentic that it would be able to make its way onto television?   Everything that makes its way onto television has to be viewed for censorship before it goes to air.  If this was indeed genuine then it would be considered a matter of national security. It would never make the air in an uncensored form period.
aliens,34kak0,ghostdate,2,Sat May 2 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's not exactly obvious what happened and there could be so much conjecture over what actually took place that it wouldn't be seen as an issue to any sort of governmental agency. That's of course assuming the government knows/is concerned about such things.  This discussion alone is kind of proving that they don't need to censor everything that goes on tv, because many assume it's a hoax."
aliens,34kak0,orca9999,-2,Sat May 2 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this. Plus, if the government took down everything that did make it on TV, it would only generate more drama because there'd be whistleblowers everywhere."

aliens,34kak0,Dysnomi,7,Sat May 2 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"Some electrical fault in the factory, first one shocks him and he passes out. Second one awakens him with the flash of light. Although to be honest, the second 'flash of light' in the narrative doesn't match the video well, so could just be a car passing, the bit of brightness is not like the electric discharge the first time. So in this case, shocked, passed-out, car driving by wakes him, he craws back inside.   There is no definitive proof of anything here, really, other than the guy got shocked and showed up crawling up and getting sick. Any explanation of things not seen in the footage is pure speculation. As such Occam's razor would say accident is more probable.  This is with the assumption the footage has not been modified, something that can't be overlooked."

For example the universe is not thought to collapse back onto it self anymore. It appears to be speeding up due to ""dark energy"", so it will as it looks expand forever until matter is so far apart and cold it is really just nothing.   This is a property of space it self expanding.   Also dark matter was never a determining factor in the expected collapse, except it would have made it happen sooner.   Dark matter is needed to exist for other factors to work because the math shows most mechanisms of galaxies etc... to not have enough mass/gravity for its behaviour.   You make other questionable suggestions about technology too but I'm not going to bother going into that. I will simply suggest digging deeper if it interests you."

aliens,34htnr,NerevarTheWise,8,Fri May 1 07:26:28 2015 UTC,"People have a tendency to think their mind can handle a lot more than they really can. You consciously think you'd love to talk to an alien, but your dream experiences would suggest that when you think you're having this encounter, you become terrified. Not necessarily because of any malevolence on the part of the alien being, but because it's such an immense and foreign experience that you're not ready for it. I get scared by stuff that I consciously think is stupid all the time. Just last night I had a nightmare about a floating stuffed doll, which now that I'm awake seems really stupid. The more I think about it, the more I realize if I did see a stuffed doll floating around, seemingly of its own accord, I would be terrified, because it's such an unnatural thing to experience. I don't think anybody would handle an encounter with an otherworldly being very well. Many would be terrified, it's just in our nature to fear what we don't know. This actually kind of explains why they don't just approach us about abductions and experimentation, so many people think they'd be okay with aliens walking in and just asking them. Realistically you'd be extremely freaked out and probably wouldn't be able to handle it, so it makes sense that they would do something to us so we don't remember such a terrifying experience."

The simplest being that your a more sensitive person.   As for the possible abduction, have you any unexplained scars marks or lumps that originate from around that time?  Have you ever spoke to your dad and step mom about the occasion?  If you indeed have  repressed memories of an abduction hypnosis may reveal it or possibly astral projection. I've no real experience with either however."

aliens,34dn34,lobob123,2,Thu Apr 30 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"OP, the only way to find out what truly happened is to go to a professional, licensed, hypnotist and recall the memories of what happened that night. You'll be able to tell if you were either sleepwalking or abducted.   I will say, however, that flashes of light are known to happen during abductions and when aliens are appearing or disappearing.

Abduction/Experience events are fragmented jigsaw pieces that require careful exploration and putting back together in the 'bigger picture' of your life experiences so far. You would need to look at your life as a whole, rather than isolating this incident. Other things are more likely to have 'developed' after this, even if it's years after the event. It's unlikely that an abduction/experienced event would be a one-off. Family members are usually very helpful in reflecting if there has been something similar in 'high strangeness' terms with other members of the family. Your lineage is your best resource for accessing answers on this. Good luck with your investigation!"

From on top the plateaus of Mexico, to the mountainside of the Rockies, a taller distance, and a clear view of the area would allow you to see several degrees of the horizon, which is also a curve (latitudinal and longitudinal lines)."

Inhabitable planets would be of interest to any advanced race, period. There's plenty of beings that probably never invented a method of currency to drive people towards greed and warfare, and possibly developed much a much higher level of consciousness (and technology) that did not include bombs.  Our time on an intergalactic scale is laughable so we shouldn't assume we're ""special"" to this Earth that we are destroying day by day. Plenty were here before us because of the incredible conditions, resources, beauty, and abundance of animal life. Any science-oriented race would find this place unique & fascinating. (not to mention us being here)  I'm convinced that this planet continues to be visited daily by hundreds of ET races and has been doing so over a span of millions of years. Individual people have made contact so why wouldn't governments? They even reverse-engineered UFO technology decades ago, can you think of how far they've come by now? Historical events that have not been made public or even recorded? Unreleased patents? You really think they ""have no idea""? Still? What about bio engineering programs and the (possibly) hundreds of psychological studies that have been kept under wraps? The mind is such a powerful thing, they are more than aware of (not just physical) but spiritual beings in our universe (astral plane, telepathical abilities etc.) with all the anomalies & ""gifted"" minds that have been out there over centuries.  In our case, we have grown out of our spiritual selves and into a military-oriented machine supplied by opression of other countries & a robotized workforce. Just look at Buddhism or the Sumerian tablets. Life was much deeper back then. The amount of information and referencing in our history is insane (even in the short period of time since written history has existed on an evolutionary scale). These people are clearly aware of other worlds, beings, and technology & have researched it for years with the highest capacity talent & budgets.   I can't imagine the amount of research material they possess. Hopefully it will one day meet the public eye."

What may have been Cold War secrecy originally (""it's not us but wouldn't it be nice if the Russians thought it WAS?"") could have shifted into a basic economic stability rationale. When the two largest industries in the world are oil and defense, admitting that we're in contact with a civilization with a far superior non-petroleum fuel source, who oh yeah could also disable our best weapons at will, well, that would cause worldwide market chaos, to say the least, even if people themselves took the news calmly."

aliens,3425gw,enlilsumerian,6,Mon Apr 27 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"I like it. Well said and very well put together.  Disclosure in the form of coming out and saying ""We've known about them for 70+ years etc etc"" would immediately send the highly religious groups of people into denial and possible volatile behaviour. Whether it's because they refuse to reconcile that what they have always been taught is wrong or at best, not entirely accurate as far as it's original interpretation, the outcome is more than likely going to be negative.   Knowing this, the Govt's of the world would be able to control this best by telling everyone that the ETs are bad and we are good. Throw up the False Flag to get everyone to be on your side and you can do pretty much whatever you want.

I've always felt that many of the more legit sightings seem to come in waves of similar/same ships being seen for a few weeks/months/years and then stop. This indicates the likelyhood of explorer ships checking out the local fauna, etc.  Our own technology is making discovery more likely the deeper we can look out into the cosmos.   I definitely don't think that we are alone in the universe. I look at our species as being very young technologically, I hold out hope that other intelligence out there has figured out interstellar travel, because that gives our species hope of surviving long term rather than living and dying on this rock hurtling through space.  So, if there are species who have overcome the issues with interstellar travel that we currently see as a great barrier, then it becomes much more likely that they would be explorers. And seeing as we have indications of something unexplained happening in our biosphere it seems quite probable that visitation is a reality."

The societal impact on social issues alone ... is hard to predict.  Financial impact ... hard to predict.  Those in power will seek to do anything to remain in power.  I am hopeful that as society matures as a whole, disclosure becomes more and more plausible to TPTB.  Also do we really need full disclosure, would that not just serve our ego's?  I think most of us on this subreddit already have concluded that it is a real thing, and it is non-human. I would love disclosure, but to me at the deepest level is more of a ""haha I was right this whole time"" ego boost than anything.  Vindication that we don't really need.

Now idk so much how much distortion happens in image stitching when looking the other direction (in this case towards the sky), but as I checked the actual street view of this, there is way too much distance covered before the ship actually changes in size. I noticed the car is travelling to the left of the ship. When you move the image with the car, you notice the stop light it approaches is yellow, and then turns red, meaning that the car stayed in the same spot for a reasonable while before moving on. Now it's typical to hear that UFOs can hover still, yet as you continue down the road, as I was saying with increasing distance, the UFO stays in relative bearing of the car yet we know the car is moving. Therefore that means that the UFO cannot be stationary as we were originally proclaiming. This will take some serious research, as who knows if the UFO was studying the car and in pursuit of it, or by very little chance is image distortion from image stitching messing up our observations of its actual travel path. I'd be more interested to know when these images were taken and see if vocal descriptions of locals can match the time frame. Overall I don't mean to disprove the image, but just bring light debate into it's reasoning of it's appearance and straight reasonability."

Environmental lawsuit of article  Area 51:       In 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the USAF and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Their suit, in which they were represented by George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. Biopsies taken from the complainants were analyzed by Rutgers University biochemists, who found high levels of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and trichloroethylene in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which governs handling of dangerous materials.) They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman Lee H. Hamilton, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl, ""The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit.""

These possible cross-roads continue up where we split the animal kingdom for example eventually into insects, fish, reptiles, mammals etc...

These developments are incredibly well documented for both microprocessors and kevlar. In neither was there a giant leap but slow gradual improvements. I really want to believe but as a scientist that claim was almost laughably absurd.

When I was a teen I dreamt I was a toddler again and laying in my childhood bed (which was situated right up against a window). The moon was unusually bright and I could see it outlining the heavy wooden blinds that covered the window. I had the urge to stand up and poke my fingers through the slats to peek outside into the night. What I saw when I peeked out were three small stationary crafts parked at different distances. I looked at them, and I looked down at the ground one story below me (side of the house) where I saw three small dead but preserved whales presented on the gravel in a row. They were lined up by size, the largest being probably 16 feet long, all facing the same direction. I sensed the crafts were benevolent, but being a nervous little kid afraid of the dark I climbed down from my bed and to run down the hall to my mom's room. I began tugging her arm and she woke up and then as I tried to tell her what was outside I woke up from the dream."
aliens,33orfe,Lexerz,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"This is long.  Everything seems transom but it's all related. I dreamt that my husband and I lived in one of those apartments where the glass goes from the floor to the ceiling and we are very high up so that we can not open any windows. Well one night we are having fun and I run into the living room in the process. I stop in my tracks as I look outside because I can see Uranus and Saturn. They look like they are leaning into each other and very close to the Earth. I can see their colors and everything. I yell for my husband to come look at the planets, forgetting their names. I say, ""You know the planet with the rings and the other one"" and he says, as he can clearly see them too, ""You mean Saturn and Uranus"".   It cuts to the next morning. I'm wearing my trench coat for work and I bend down at my knees to feed the cats. The day is cloudy and it's a bit windy. Out of the corner of my eye I see a flash of lightning, then another and another. The weird thing about it is that the lightning is exactly the same, same length, same point of origin, same pattern, duration etc. I start thinking there's something weird going on (Don't know why Saturn and Uranus didn't tip me off...). I notice that the lightning is more towards the suburbs where my family lives so I go to check on them.   I go to my grandmother's house (who is more like my husband's grandmother than my own except in the dream she is senile though in real life she is sharp and adorable). She has laid out a bunch of towels in the back yard, intending to let them dry and then wash them. In the dream it is just something she prefers doing, like a quirk she has always had. Her best friend lives across the street. The wind is really picking up now and I just want my grandmother to be inside safe and sound.   I ask my grandmother what she needs done and she's like ""Oh nothing, I was just going to wash these. "", pointing to the towels, so I start gathering them quicklyand my grandmother goes inside.   The neighbor lady/best friend comes out of her house and walks over with a huge smile on her face. She asks, ""Does your grandmother want to come over for some pie?"" She speaks the way Audrey Hepburn speaks. I say, no, my grandmother is doing laundry and she needs to be inside and that the lady should go inside as well.   Right about then my grandmother is coming out of the house and the neighbor lady tries to ask her if she wants to go over for pie, I'm trying to usher my grandmother inside and my grandmother is worried that I haven't gotten all the towels. So I assure her I have everything and we are going inside now and say a quick goodbye to the neighbor lady.   I follow my grandmother inside and I turn to shut the door behind us. I notice that the lady is standing there giving me an icy cold stare of pure hate. I shut the door, lock it and tell my grand mother that she is not to unlock this for anyone even the neighbor lady.  I proceed to do laundry and then I finally get to work. At work there is a sort of romantic saga going on between this work study guy and one of the younger Co workers (I love that even in my dreams I'm the motherly responible co worker wth).   This guy drives a red car that looks like one of the Grease Lightning cars, red, top down, shiny. Nothing happens at work really.   I end up going home. My husband is already home safe and sound. He brings the paper home with him and I see on the front page that aliens have invaded the earth and that they have an affinity for red cars from the 50s just like the one the guy had.   And it scared me because I also remembered the neighbor woman, though she did not have a red car that I could see. I told my husband, ""This! This is the car that - has). And the dream ends.   Still, one of the more immersing and more subtley terrifying dreams I've had.  I had another dream where I went up in an alien spaceship and showed me the world ending.  It was very scary.  They were seated along the circumference  of a round space ship. Everything looked the way things look in the movies.  Except it was terrifying."

It's very hard to talk about prehistoric contact with aliens for obvious reasons. But most of the contact evidence we seem to have comes from the last 10 thousand years or less. It's possible we weren't so much created by aliens than stumbled upon and guided towards civilization in the relatively recent past.   Humans evolved and developed intelligence on their own, but only reached complex concepts like architecture, metalworking and such thanks to alien intervention.   On the other hand, it's possible aliens have known about the planet for millions of years, but never took an interest in it.   Life is probably relatively common in the universe, so finding yet another planet with life wouldn't be that noteworthy just because this one happens to have giant lizards.   Dinosaurs were impressive animals, yes. But they also were quite limited, with incredibly small brains for their size, and nothing more than raw instinct to guide them. This probably made them a lousy target for, uh... Uplifting.   Mammals were nothing more than shrews and rats at the time too, so any intelligent species would rule out they becoming the dominant species on Earth, the same way we would rule out Racoons becoming intelligent and starting civilizations of their own.   In the end, they would've had no reason to bother with this planet for another 60 million years."

aliens,33oay9,tollfreecallsonly,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm so torn about this extraterrestrial deal. Let me start off by saying that I am christian. Not your very common Westborough baptist type. I believe the bible is 100% the truth.  That being said, it never mentions a thing about beings within our physical dimension other than us humans, animals, and other organisms. This doesn't mean they don't exist. It just simply means God didn't say.  Silence neither confirms or denies either side.   I have a few theories on this. Do we know everything without a shadow of a doubt what happened in our human history? Absolutely not. Can we place our faith in history books or scientists? Not well enough. The only constant is to be inquisitive and keep looking for answers. The ancient alien theory, by itself, does actually hold more stability than most people would like to admit. SOMETHING happened. If not in the christian God, or any higher power, most of us can agree that spirits exist. Could most of this be the work of something supernatural? Could the aliens be extraterrestrial or a guise set by spirits outside our dimension? Spirits, or whatever you'd like to call them, would most likely have a much more sophisticated knowledge of our universe. If you can believe in aliens, I feel you can have the capacity to believe in the supernatural as well."
aliens,33oay9,Krunchykhaos,4,Fri May 1 01:56:14 2015 UTC,"Generally, the ancient alien theory believes that regular evolution existed on Earth, and the dinosaurs came and went. It was not until about 400,000 years ago that aliens started colonizing parts of Earth and playing a role in the genetic enhancements of early man (not until 100,000 years ago or later), crossbreeding early man (e.g. Homo Erectus) with their own race to create Homo Sapiens. So dinosaurs are inconsequential as the ancient alien story came well after that."
aliens,33oay9,Eurotrashie,2,Fri Apr 24 05:05:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you believe is the story of the entire alien chapter. Some say they were wiped out to make way for an experiment (us). Some say that some survived, evolved and became sentient beings. The expansion on that theory is that these said reptilian beings later would go out into the stars and become known as the Draco Reptilians.   And of course, there's the theory that they just died out due to extinction."

I would really truly love for disclosure to happen, but after following this whole topic for quite a while, and crossing my fingers for disclosure, I've begun to grow a bit cynical about it all.   Anyhow, I've taken a lil time to read through some of the recently declassified docs, and for the rare (like 1 in 500+) people actually interested in reading through lengthy, boring, hit and miss pages of UFO reports, you will find some pretty interesting stuff. All with no conclusions;  http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/us/feat-air-force-ufo-project-blue-book/  Knowing for 100% sure that technologically advanced UFO's exist sucks, tbh. It's an unsolvable problem that tries my mind. Investing energy in search of truths (like that of UFO's) is a vacuum of disappointment that only leaves you with more questions the more you research."

So ether aliens are incredibly stupid and use false equivalence all the time, or they're just pandering to whatever they believe to be our version of reality. If you look at how they treat abductees it's obvious they are doing the latter. Pretending to support Christianity, playing toward sympathy, manipulating reactions out of people, feeding them false dates and promises, and the list unfortunately goes on for what seems like an eternity.  So unless it serves their plans, whatever they maybe (think hybrid integration and control), they will not show themselves unless it benefits them and only them."

It's common knowledge or so I thought that abductees have been given constant dates of impending disasters, alien arrival exc. Then the dates come to pass and nothing happens. I believe 2012 was the last major one given to a lot of abductees.  Christianitiy you can look at several major abductions where the aliens give it a Christian overtone even calling themselves angels and having Jesus appear. The problem with that is historically there is no Jesus Christ. He is an invention of the Romen Empire as part of their new state religion Christianity. I think the Andrason case had this, but I may be mistaken.  Manipulating people's reactions is an easy notice, ever wonder why people even though they're abducted experimented on, lied to, develop sympathy even love for their persecutors? It's put in them.  Thus I wonder if gullibility for lack of a better word is a factor in determining if they want someone to remember. Few people outright called aliens on their crap and the one abductee that i know of that did wound up dead. That was Karla Turner."

The ability to establish contact is in our own hands. It is based off of everyone's opinions/beliefs/attitudes on earth.
