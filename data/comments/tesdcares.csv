tesdcares,3e1uf9,Boomkinn,3,Tue Jul 21 08:44:08 2015 UTC,"It's a nice thought of you to do. And I loved this discussion when I heard it on the pod.  ..Having said that. It was super tiring watching the images flash over my face every split second. I found myself turning it off 2 minutes in, and putting Ep 234 on instead to re-listen to it without the video. But yeah, your heart is in the right place, it's nice that you want to get some friends into the pod, I've tried for a while! :)"
tesdcares,3e1uf9,LuckyBoyfriendTESD,2,Tue Jul 21 10:46:44 2015 UTC,I actually dug the picture placement. Made me chuckle a few times. One time it went to Q's pic and he didn't even say anything he just kinda groaned. Made me laugh.

tesdcares,3dzn10,arkansas80,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:36:02 2015 UTC,I think part of the reason it felt better back then was because you were learning the characters as you went. Except for the guys having less time I don't thing alot has changed.

tesdcares,3dxiae,UnknownCosmonaut,4,Mon Jul 20 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with you GSD: expiration dates are only a suggestion. The companies only choose some random date that will ensure the consumer repurchases their product preemptively, or to avoid lawsuits/recalls.   I'm constantly battling the husband to eat dried pasta that might be couple of moths past due, or cream that has been opened for 8 days or spices that expired. (spices/honey never goes bad imo) It's come to the point that I use with nail polish to scrub those little dates off with numbers I don't agree with.   That being said, 7 years is a little long... even for me, dude. But isn't that kinda cake mix just flour and sugar? you have to add the eggs, and oil and nonsense."

tesdcares,3dxiae,rhad_rhed,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"Also, for anyone who's interested, this is the topic on John Oliver this week.  (expiration dates, not a 100 year old cake)"
tesdcares,3dxiae,LumieLuna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"This was really interesting!  I have been working at the local food bank donation center and I was happy to see what they took, but sad at how much was also tossed. They keep canned goods 1 year out from the expiration date, and unopened boxed goods 30 days after. We also had to toss a lot of things too like donated food that was already opened/half eaten, or for being extremely past the expiration date - like this box of jello from 1978 we found. Git'em, want some jello?"
tesdcares,3dxiae,rhad_rhed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"A 1978 box of jello would fetch a price on eBay, no? Nostalgia and whatnot? I tried to buy a set of gremlins sheets, but they were 80 fuckin dollars. (Boo)   I remember there was a documentary about ""freegans"" aka people who just go around dumpster diving and getting slightly outdated food. That's worthwhile.   I saw something pretty cool in California too-there was a clearance aisle that had stuff that was expiring that day or the next day at a deep deep discount. I was in heaven. The husband was convinced I was going to die & he'd have to haul my dead toxin-bloated body into the Pacific. Spoilers: nothing happened."

tesdcares,3dwzze,LawyersGunsAndMoney,9,Mon Jul 20 13:31:51 2015 UTC,Probably an ever-evolving set of rules so Walt can properly manipulate the competition.

tesdcares,3dwzze,wormfodder,4,Mon Jul 20 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"The guys never said anything about it. This douche keeps claiming he has some inside TESD knowledge but never can back it up with any proof. He's either a crappy troll, Maxwell in hiding, or someone who reads Walt's tweets.  Those threads went out of control more because of moderators removing threads and Maxwell baiting people than anything that happened on the actual show. Every time they've spoken about the sub they seem to understand that sometimes things are going to be said that a TESD member would probably not want to read."
