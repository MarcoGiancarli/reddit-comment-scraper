adultswim,3dzqyf,sskhalil,4,Tue Jul 21 10:19:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Mr. Pickles, but pragmatically, the Seth shows all get excellent ratings from my understanding. As it is with Toonami, everything begins and ends with ratings over at Adult Swim. That's why, for example, Toonami used to be 11:30pm->6am Saturday/Sunday nights and is now 12am->3:30a.m. with reruns of King of the Hill/Family Guy after it. For whatever reason, 4 a.m. reruns of King of the Hill draw in more viewers than anime that didn't air on any other day of the week did. It's just the facts and the numbers.  It really is a shame and it sucks but that's the business unfortunately."

They were serene, they were calm and at 2am, 3am, 4am, whatever, they just made the whole night feel comfortable and quiet while I was watching anime with them.

adultswim,3d25qa,MyNinthRedditAccount,20,Sun Jul 12 22:33:50 2015 UTC,Home Movies  air it forever fuck the ratings
adultswim,3d25qa,kianworld,2,Mon Jul 13 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"I remember wanting to put this into my post, but reading that whenever they put Home Movies into the lineup it always causes ratings to plummet (either because the Fox shows rate so high OR because they never promoted it).  To their credit they have tried to put it back into the lineup at least twice since 2009..."
adultswim,3d25qa,SeverHense,3,Mon Jul 13 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"To be fair, iirc, the ratings weren't completely terrible, but seemed to fluctuate between either decent (~800k) and poor (~500k) each week it aired. Compared to what stuff like King of the Hill gets at that time, it wasn't that low, but compared to, say, Family Guy, it looks pretty weak.  A Bob's Burgers/Home Movies pair-up might do well if it were advertised because the two shows were helmed by many of the same people.   Or even throw it on later at night (like DVR Theater) if there are concerns about whether it will get good ratings in a primetime slot.  Hell,  even 12 Oz. Mouse got almost a million viewers airing at 4:15 AM a few weeks back."

He also wrote his phone number on it. Well she gives me the number and me and a friend call it & holy crap it was actually him. We were on the phone with him for like 2 hours while he told us all about how his ex wife is a racist bitch and all kinds of wacky things about christian science and how tim & eric were assholes.

Pretty sure there was never a gorilla with chainsaw arms though. This show is animated in 3D cgi, not a drawn cartoon. So if your show was 2D animated then it definitely was not Xavier."

Krieger's holographic anime girlfriend, pigley, they even had a guy with a robot body which is straight out of Sealab. Archer never had a Bizarro episode but he did turn into Bob from Bob's Burgers for a minute. Sealab was just less linear and therefore it allowed for more random shit to be thrown in for no reason.

It was really just a theory that the show was this important to them. I hope they don't take 1 hit in 14 years (other than maybe The Boondocks and Robot Chicken) as a sign that other hits are really practically within their reach. I think a more likely recipe for success would be cultivating relationships with talent long term with people like Neely that have solid block appeal and will give them multiple shows, the way they did with guys like Willis and Maiellaro, Reed and Thompson, Tim and freakin' Eric, the PFFR guys, Small, Cordry, and McGruder."

adultswim,3c8kc6,grandmoffcory,3,Mon Jul 6 03:36:30 2015 UTC,The other is just the person who originally called Bloody Mary then she called Candyman and then he called Beetlejuice. I wish I could find the clip of it.

I had a classmate one year ahead of me get a gig at Robot Chicken. He worked for free in Los Angeles for one year for them, after he graduated. He was brought on for 2 years and got paid before moving onto Bojack Horseman and other stuff.    If you want something, you have to do everything. The creator of the Misadventures of Flapjack slept outside of CN in Burbank before he was given an internship to work on Powerpuff Girls."

adultswim,3cbo14,Trill-I-Am,3,Wed Jul 8 03:19:22 2015 UTC,I'm surprised shows still get away with putting dark themed elements on childrens networks.    Thurop Van Orman put everything into Flapjack. He spent two months straight 18-20 hour days making the intro to the show.

adultswim,3by3xc,taxiSC,23,Fri Jul 3 02:54:35 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about the communication between the admins and mods? Do they give you the tools you need to do what you do? That's what this is really about. The whole thing with Victoria was just a tipping point. I'm not a mod, so I can't answer those questions -- but if you do feel ignored or neglected, then I would support going private."
adultswim,3by3xc,taxiSC,19,Fri Jul 3 03:07:42 2015 UTC,A sub of our size doesn't really have answers for those questions because they're just not relevant concerns for us. We've never had one AMA here. But I think we as a subreddit can recognize the underlying trends in admin management that they way they've handled this represent. Whether or not our concern for those trends rises to the level warranting going private is an open question.
adultswim,3by3xc,517634,12,Fri Jul 3 03:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'm always of the opinion that voicing support, but waiting a short while before joining a protest is the most prudent option. It ensures that you don't look a total fool if the protest fizzles, but allows you to still support what you believe in. Of course, this is a slightly cowardly approach if you really believe in the cause.  I, personally, am not that passionate about the issue. I think voicing support and possibly doing something like removing skins to show support is a good short-term option, with an option to go dark if the admins don't respond appropriately. This acknowledges the same thing you just said about not being directly affected by the issue -- after all the whole idea of going private originated as /r/AMA needing time to figure out how to run itself, which doesný apply to us."

adultswim,3bscwv,Chefca,-8,Wed Jul 1 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"the show has become derivative of its former seasons, there's nothing new coming out of the show, the first few seasons had really great characters, but these new seasons are just the same stuff ad nauseum.  MC Pee Pants, The cybernetic ghost of christmas past, billywitchdoctor.com, the mooninites.  lots of really great, quotable episodes, but I haven't heard, or seen a new quote from the newer seasons that was super funny in forever.  I feel like it's the best possible time to do this, the show is becoming just obnoxious with the seasonal name changes, it's going the way of south park with the over the top toilet humor except there's no cultural references to keep people interested.  That's why rick, and morty is doing so well, that show is touching on serious cultural issues, and spotlighting them in a humorous manner.  ATHF doesn't now, nor ever did have that.  I feel like Williams street is cleaning house, this, and metalocalypse, and I feel like they might be setting their sights on venture brothers next since astrobase go has dragged its feet every season, that WS just isn't gonna deal with it any more.  And I feel like that's a real travesty, that the hipster twins' nonsense is going to cost them what might be the best show that's ever been on AS."
adultswim,3bscwv,wayback000,12,Wed Jul 1 22:45:56 2015 UTC,"I think you missed most of the charm of the show. It was a show about nothing from the start, and if anything, its done a fantastic job of staying true to its roots. It was always ridiculous and over the top in a subtle way, i mean it was a crime fighting team made of fast food."
adultswim,3bscwv,ghostm66,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:01:44 2015 UTC,"You might even be right about the quality of the show, but a decline in quality doesn't usually mean cancellation.  See the Simpsons, Adventure Time and countless others.  Or Williams Street really is is a company that cares about the quality of their products at an unusual level, even putting it above their profits if ATHF has been doing well.  But I think Chefca is right, there must be more to this story."
adultswim,3bscwv,microCACTUS,-6,Thu Jul 2 19:05:55 2015 UTC,"the simpsons has remained the exact same show for 30 years, there has been no loss, or gain in quality.  cant speak about adventure time.  but I think loss of quality does lead to cancellation.  I have no idea why you think otherwise."
adultswim,3bscwv,wayback000,3,Thu Jul 2 19:15:12 2015 UTC,"This opinion and analysis have become an integral part of pop culture these days, almost like the dislike for the Phantom Menace. There is certainly controversy, but the idea that the Simpsons have  noticeably dropped in quality is pretty widespread.  The whole process of degeneration of a character is called ""Flanderization"". People who like the new Simpsons can be found, but there is a very vocal part of the watchers who feel like the show isn't what it used to be.  As for the loss in quality-cancellation relation, companies usually have the primary concern of being profitable: with rare exceptions of focused management, if something is generating revenue you just keep doing it, and stop only once it isn't profitable anymore. Not earlier. It makes more sense to run safe and familiar ideas into the ground and make too much of a profitable thing, rather than risking a jump in the dark with a new series.  Murky and stagnant waters are always preferred to weird and uncharted waters in usual business practice.  This is clearly not the best for watchers, but it's the course of action that usually entertainment companies follow.  Tried-and-tested is the norm in business decisions of this kind. Change is scary.  So I think something might have pushed their hands here. Either that or the all important profits that ATHF brought weren't as good as Maiellaro says (""it generates a lot of revenue""), and as everyone thought (ATHF characters have been the face of AdultSwim for a long time).    Or it really was an unusual, bold business decision."
adultswim,3bscwv,microCACTUS,2,Thu Jul 2 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"While I don't think modern day Simpsons is as bad as most people, you are out of your mind if you think the show hasn't gone down in quality over the years. There is no way that the latter seasons are as good as the first 10-ish seasons.  Loss of quality is hardly ever the direct cause of cancellation. It tends to lead to a decline in ratings, and that is the real reason shows get cancelled. This doesn't apply to ATHF though as the show still does well in the ratings."

adultswim,3bscwv,the_onion_night,5,Wed Jul 1 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"That's a shame.  I see no problem with a series being finite, but the issue is we need to know it's being replaced by something of equal or greater value.  Otherwise, it seems pointless to kill a staple of the network without any prospects apart from more syndicated Seth MacFarlane or filler shows that shouldn't last beyond two seasons."

Personally, if they just renewed Eagleheart I would be appeased.  They can fill three hours of complete crap so long as they're producing that one A+ legitimately funny show."
adultswim,3bscwv,Ooobles,11,Thu Jul 2 01:22:34 2015 UTC,Eric Andre is a television classic. Neely's sketch show coming this fall I think absolutely has the potential to be a classic.

So for them to let it go is just a bit odd.”  the network's got like 150 episodes of the show to their name, and will still be bringing in revenue from it without having you on the books. it can allot that money to producing new shows and hoping one of them hits."

""The Cleveland Show,"" the ""Family Guy""/""The Simpsons"" crossover (weird for the latter to collaborate with the former if it's so hated, right?), or any of his pre-""Family Guy "" career weren't really mentioned at all, quite strangely in the case of ""Cleveland"" because it was delayed, bad, and then cancelled. And I think it was a replacement for ""King of the Hill"" or maybe even why it was cancelled, citation needed. Also:   [H]e was an equal-opportunity offender only when it came to people [...] who didn't look or think like him.   Brian Griffin is essentially Seth as a dog."

Family Guy is getting close to running its course, Cleveland left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, and nobody seemed to like A Million Ways To Die In The West. Ted 2's failure is a combination of all these things.  I also think he gets an unfair amount of blame for people's problems with Family Guy. Sure, he created it, produces it, and stars on it, but in reality, he has only written two episodes. Yes, I know he has the power to change a script or tell his writer's that something is too much, but with how busy he is all the time, I don't think he is to blame for all of people's problems with the show.   I can't really hate on the guy when he created American Dad, which has always been the best of his shows and continues to be great."

Seth is a great person that has done a lot of wonderful things.  You can hate his shows and movies all you want but don't hate the person.  That's just ridiculous.    Absolutely just as stupid as the people who hate actors because of a character they played."

adultswim,3bsd3e,phantomcosmonauts,2,Thu Jul 2 16:13:22 2015 UTC,"I loved McFarlane during Family Guy's original run. I'd argue pre-revival Family Guy was the best 3 seasons of animated comedy ever (though i'm cautious to say it because of how great early simpsons is).  However, the revival ruined the show and the characters, Ted was decent at best, didn't bother with his other 2 big movies, and him banging Emilia Clarke when I had a crush on her led me to 'hate' the dude. At least as much as you can hate someone you don't know who isn't necessarily a bad person."

I think that youtube video had like 2,000 views.  I think the creators stated they just want to move on, which is fair. I'd rather have a holy grail of a series that ended in a blaze of glory than one that faded away as it's creative input slowly died.  Maybe they'll do something else! It's a unique show, the storylines are very surreal and abstract, and nonsensical to the point where most people besides me hate it. I LOVE that.  And like JoTheKhan mentioned, we still have some great shows left.  I'm just sad to see that era of flash animation being wiped from the channel (i.e sealab, frisky dingo, etc.)  :("

Heart She Holler is fairly complex, as each season starts over in a new universe. So I wouldn't say you are missing much. And honestly you have to watch it.    It's fairly difficult to find, but you should be able to find it on kickass. Downloading I mean.    The first episode of each season sets the main story usually. But you really should watch the first season. A lot happens in the first episode alone that sets the entire series.    And yes, it has been renewed for a 4th season. However, every season they have aired consecutively daily. So it's usually over in two weeks."

adultswim,3b1dvi,Trill-I-Am,10,Thu Jun 25 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't see the musical yet but this was my favorite season so far. That Celeb episode was awesome, I like when when Trump's head hits the ground cumming. Still like the short online vids best, they seemed to have the best songs by far. Idk I liked it!"
adultswim,3b1dvi,leelee9000,4,Thu Jun 25 06:44:05 2015 UTC,"I only saw the first three episodes but I agree with this at least so far.   The end of the pizza episode, hilarious.   Urkules, brilliant.   Also baby cakes is amazing no matter what he does or says, always makes me laugh."
adultswim,3b1dvi,Andaroodle,8,Thu Jun 25 06:53:15 2015 UTC,"I agree it wasn't amazing but there are good bits I thought. The think tank, getting two weirdos laid, the gummi house Cakes made and the gummi addictions, Frank falling in love with a gummi string or whatever it was, the Trump episode where the girl falls on the doorknob. Brother killing his wife ""who said my wife was a woman."" The episode where everyone on the planet dies.    A lot of situational comedy I was laughing out. Although the premise of the Succubutt episode was crude and funny, I found that episode to be the weakest. I caught bits of the last episode and didn't think it was that great either.    I agree, I think the prior seasons are better. But I still found this season pretty good. IMO"
adultswim,3b1dvi,amp3rsand,3,Thu Jun 25 08:15:20 2015 UTC,"It seems like they've really just dropped the sub-characters and it's been the Smith Bros, Pony and BC show in S3.  As much as I love them, they need the other teachers in the mix too. The Dean still feels like right, he's probably my favorite character in S3, at least whenever he shows up. Pony's dialogue is dull, and they could probably cut her speaking parts out and nobody would even notice, but then again she might've always been like that. I gotta say the worst was probably the Succubutt thing.  The ass was just like a more-chill-but-just-as-annoying Aziz Ansari. Frank's songs in the musical were the only ones that felt like they belonged.  *Also it was Julia Roberts' pube hair."

adultswim,3b1dvi,phantomcosmonauts,2,Sat Jun 27 16:43:38 2015 UTC,I actually enjoyed this season a lot more than others but that finale musical totally left bored.
adultswim,3b1dvi,Mirtastic,2,Fri Jun 26 09:14:39 2015 UTC,"I agree it lacks the more chaotic (though super-tame compared to the Super Deluxe stuff) feel of the previous two seasons for a more traditional tv show pace which doesn't feel quite right. I did however like each episode waaaaay more upon my second viewings, it made me realize how many funny lines and situations there actually was in the season in addition to all the big ones I remembered after finishing the season the first time."
adultswim,3b1dvi,ThumbtackGlove,2,Mon Jun 29 04:23:44 2015 UTC,"Sadly I agree. I can't remember if the season 2 episodes  were half an hour but maybe the extra time requires extra padding. Or maybe there's new writers or they're going after a broader audience.  I loved the craziness and more subtle background jokes in the earlier seasons and especially the original youtube shorts. I've just had the thought that maybe it's just the show maturing a little bit, trying to tell more cohesive stories at the expense of the old insanity. Either way I'll still be watching season 4 for sure."

adultswim,3amnx5,we_are_temporary,10,Sun Jun 21 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think it is. My personal theory is that the success of Rick and Morty has surprised them so much that its shaken things up and has them thinking that, now that a an actual conventional original hit is possible for them, that they need to free up more airtime to try to come up with another one."
adultswim,3amnx5,apocolyptictodd,6,Sun Jun 21 21:53:45 2015 UTC,I fucking hope not. As much as I love R&M weird niche shows like ATHF will always be what I love about AS.

adultswim,3amydl,Trill-I-Am,6,Sun Jun 21 20:24:44 2015 UTC,It will have had 11 seasons and 140 episodes. The average number of episodes for an Adult Swim original is 25. The median's 20.  The average and median number of seasons is 2.
adultswim,3amydl,mikerallus,10,Sun Jun 21 20:32:52 2015 UTC,"To put it in further perspective, ATHF outlasted over 30 separate Adult Swim original shows in its lifetime. It was the lone constant on an ever-changing network."
adultswim,3amydl,kianworld,6,Mon Jun 22 03:08:10 2015 UTC,Looks like Squidbillies is going to be the next constant on the network. Unless they cancel that next year.

adultswim,3amydl,mikerallus,6,Mon Jun 22 04:19:35 2015 UTC,ATHF was many people's first step into the world of Adult Swim and arguably shaped both the channel and the fanbase into what it is today. I think it's just incredibly disloyal of him to cancel it when a) it's still going as strong as ever and b) the creators themselves aren't ready to stop it.

adultswim,3ahwa9,phillip_fryman,2,Sat Jun 20 20:31:42 2015 UTC,might be both. I dunno. I heard Brendon had to pay for the orchestra in one of the show's songs (i think season 4) by himself.

To add more to the ""love em or hate em"" category, there are extremely polarizing programs such as Superjail, 12 oz mouse and Squidbillies. Not to mention all of the live action programs that have popped up from the utterly surreal tim and eric programs which camp early public access tv tropes and techniques to things like Childrens Hospital and The Heart she Holler."

adultswim,393800,kianworld,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:54:07 2015 UTC,I would think it would depend on the ratings. Black Dynamite aired during a night in a slot where most people are going out. Metalocalypse had slowly less numbers per season (typical of any show really).
adultswim,393800,amp3rsand,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"Neely already has pitched a new show to AdultSwim, maybe that means China IL will at least take a break for a while."

To Cartoon Network, 10 11 minute episodes is a miniseries (like Over The Garden Wall). To Adult Swim, 10 11 minute episodes is a season. And they've done 5-6 episode seasons before, so if thats what Brendon wanted, why not let him do it? I guess I don't understand Hollywood that well."

It came out in early 2000, or possibly 2001, and it featured a musical performance from the chieftains as well as, somehow, Freddie Prinze Jr. I honestly have no idea if it was good or not, but I am overcome by the need to see it again. There is a soundtrack that is pretty easy to find, but the specials themselves remain elusive."

They seem to be featuring episodes from every season, too, instead of just selections from the final two seasons. Very exciting.  Sadly, only 5 episodes are featured in the stream loop right now: Speck, Brilliant Number Two, Fire Drill, Flipmode (with test footage from Tommy Wiseau's April Fools appearance spliced in), and Idlewild South, in that order.

I know it uses the phone to show a VR type simulation within a cardboard enclosure, but I never saw anything that might use the phone's camera. Usually the camera is used for AR, but idk if this is what it'll do.   I'm at work on my mobile at the moment. If I remember once I get home, I'll see if I can dig up the article again."

I feel between 3 and 4 or between 8 and 9 would be best for pacing. I want to incorperate it into a rewatch now. It was a suprisingly light episode for season 3.   Morel was so great at the end. Ha blind faith. When ever Morel's voice changes and he gets real honest that slays me though. Morel has such a big heart. I really miss this show. I would have loved to see where season 3 went with Morel's grandfather if it hadn't been cut. This taste of something that was lost is bittersweet.

adultswim,34sq89,amp3rsand,11,Mon May 4 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"they could have American Dad for an hour. But only the most recent season since it was acquired by TBS.    They'd have to seriously consider what would bring in +1 million viewers and move the time slot later. There originals are too adult for the hours of 8 or 9 P.M.    My guess would be an hour of American Dad at 9. Robot Chicken and Aqua Teen at 10, and assorted shows from 11 to 1:30. I'm surprised they haven't struck a deal to air Archer yet. Venture Bros would probably come back as a mainstay in reruns as well.    Or if they could figure out what to put in 8-10pm, they could attempt to fit in 2 hours of Toonami late at night. Especially reruns of super long shonens like DBZ, One Piece, Shippuden, and Bleach.    It would be cool if they could do a half-hour of experimental programming every night; like infomercials, off the air, pilots, and a 15 slot for fishcenter."

adultswim,34sq89,HorseSteroids,7,Wed May 6 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Whether we like to admit it or not, Family Guy reruns pay the bills at AS. If AS lost FG, they'd be screwed on ad revenue. Now add losing Fox-run American Dad, Bob's Burgers, King of the Hill, and the Cleveland Show and they'd be devastated. While we seem to love the original programming provided, they don't garner the ratings of the Fox stuff.    My guess is that in the long run, AS would no longer run for 10 hours a night and produce less and less original programming due to said loss of ad revenue, not to mention not being able to procure the syndication rights to anything more successful than Chozen.    While I'm not the biggest McFarlane fan, his output is a necessary evil for the growth of AS."
adultswim,34sq89,wwwes32,5,Mon May 4 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"It's fortunate for Adult Swim and for us that MacFarlane has insane amounts of money and also seems to feel loyal to Adult Swim for keeping his show alive via repeats and then bringing it back from the dead.

It's a shame we can't get reruns of older style animation like Daria, or even olf Beavis and Butthead or things like Mission Hill. But I think MTV owns BandB and Daria if I am not mistaken, but it would be nice for AS to get back to something other than going the safe route with something they know will get views."
adultswim,34sq89,bb411114,1 point,Thu May 7 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"We would loose a lot of viewers in the begging. However Seth shows and well Bobs burgers. Are basically just gateway drugs for the hardcore stuff that is AS origanl programming. I would love to see a show like: Man seeking Woman on AS. Something Eric Andre that isn't : "" The Eric Andre Show"". I would also like to see  a Moral Oral reboot something that would be possible with a all AS original programming block. Rick and Morty is a obvious choice to fill some fox show holes. The first six months with the loss of Fox shows AS could rerun their library of titles seeing what gathered the most views and comments. Then make new, or reboot old shows.   Their are also other shows that could be good for the network. Ugly Americans was cancelled on Comedy Central some time ago so the rights for at least syndication should be up in the air some where. Then theirs other options Netflix is massively popular, and so is AS. What would be really cool is if some of their stuff got on AS. BoJack Horseman is a great example of a show that's both funny, smart, dark, and depressing the exact thing that AS audience eats up.   Robot chicken would become a pillar of support versus something of a prized pet. https://youtu.be/phd2_Q9ZVVQ Robot Chicken could stand on its own. It already has a working relationship with DC so I could see a whole lot more of that. Maybe some continuing plots. Versus all of the one shot skits that Robot Chicken has become famous for.   It could also be cool to maybe step away from comedy. Like imagine if AS could make a series based off of the movie Cabin in the Woods. Where each episode shows a group of people picking a different item and dealing with the results.   Honestly though if AS lost Fox shows they would be kinda without a identity of their own for a while. They would bounce back though and maybe they wouldnt get the same attention they get now.  Like I don't think the Simpsons would ever mention the oblongs or any of the pre fox focused shows. However AS would grow back into something like it was a net work like no other, for very fucked up people."

adultswim,34fmsg,theredball,3,Fri May 1 06:57:38 2015 UTC,It's one of their highest grossing shows. I think they had a disagreement with Brendon about the final season. My guess is he wanted to end it and wrap it all up and they said no

He's looking for a way to wrap it up, they want to turn it into ATHF/squidbillies level staple.  It makes sense on both sides if you think about it. [AS] is having a hard time coming up with good original programming, they rely on fox reruns to generate their income. If they lose Metalocalypse, that's just one less reason to watch it.  From Brendon's perspective, he's an artist and deadlines/profitability are less important than quality material."
adultswim,34fmsg,WorkThrowaway321go,2,Tue May 5 13:25:51 2015 UTC,"I think it was more that Brendon wanted to go in a different direction as far as pacing. Like a long standing mini series and tie up the show in a few parts. And with Adult Swim now being the home of the 15minute quick bits. I think Brendon's world he has created warrants a bit more time and effort than what Adult Swim is looking to put into it. Which is fine for both parties, since Adult Swim has had more hits than misses with it's creative direction, and Brendon shows he genuinely cares about the lore he has created. So hopefully the split will allow Small to produce the content he and we as fans want."

While many classified it as stoner humor, I always appreciated the subtlety and humorous undertones of the clever quips, background doings and nonstop witty banter. When I think about some of the best times of being a kid, this show comes to mind. Hell, the mutual appreciation for it helped to form bonds with some of my closest friends. Not to mention I can't even begin to explain how many girls I've dated that I forced to sit down and watch it with me who ended up finding it hysterical. Although it has changed some throughout the years, to see it go signifies the ending of a chapter in my life's book. I will sincerely miss it.

During adolescence I began to understand more of the humor. In high school I discovered marijuana and adult swim's brand of alternative, absurdist humor became my go to entertainment.     Now I'm in the last few weeks of my senior year of college and I have watched and rewatched every episode of ATHF. It never gets old for me. I feel like I'm losing something that had always been a part of my life. I'm sad, but eventually that will pass. Mostly I'm grateful that a show like ATHF had the opportunity to live this long and do all the crazy stuff other shows don't get to do. The combination of this show's creativity and Adult Swim's willingness to let it be so creative is what has made it so special.

Without playing the opening, the episode immediately goes to the Moon. The Mooninites have gathered a bunch of their villain friends for one final push towards eliminating the Aqua Teens. However, they do not succeed, and much of their group is eliminated from the meeting. Only the Rabbot, the Mooninites, Mothmonsterman, Ol' Drippy, Happy Time Harry, the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and Major Shake get to South Jersey. They plan to shove ""The Screw of Damnation"" into the Hunger Force's heads. When the Mooninites were asked how they would get it in there, the Mooninites planned (They planned on having the others do it) on giving the Hunger Force a Post-It note saying ""Stay Still."" Later in the episode, they decide to make a cool group name. The brownies suggest ""Click-Click-Click-Click"" and they finally settle on the Rabbot's idea, ""Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday"" because the Ghost repeats it upon hearing it.

Look at Space Ghost Coast To Coast, [as] ended it at the right time, and it's still one of the most beloved and most talk about shows. It's outdated-ness still holds up anyway, so maybe Aqua Teen will be like that as well.  Hell I still hysterically laugh at first few seasons of the ATHF like I was 14 all over again. So if they are actually ending it (or if it's a joke) then let us remember what Aqua Teen was and enjoy what they gave us all these years. 15 years to be on tv is pretty long if you think about it."

The only thing I can say about Aqua Teen Hunger Force is that it is grounded in such a strong pseudo-reality. All these crazy phenomena happen while half the characters play it off as ""are you crazy?"" and the other half are like ""yeah, you are going to get your dicked ripped off. okay. let's do it.""

Made by Brian Cartoons, it was syndicated (mainly to NBC affiliates)  and distributed by ITC Entertainment. The shows were sometimes re-edited into half-hour (including commercials) blocks by local stations.  The series featured the adventures of a diver in an old-fashioned diving suit who talked to the passing fish. The series was filmed in live action with puppet fish; the underwater effect was achieved by shooting through an aquarium.    Image i - Cover from Alpha Video's 2006 DVD release of Diver Dan.

Inversely, I was watching the film ""2012"" the other day and noticed a similar lack of plot, only instead of compelling dialogue and acting, it was just suspense sequences with near-death experience after near-death experience. That movie actually has very little plot at all. I definitely wouldn't hold it in the same esteem as the episodes I mentioned above, but it does go to show you that entertainment does not necessarily have to have the same format all the time.

I guess the fact that Children's Hospital is still up means they negotiated something, but I think the 24/7 VB stream means Netflix probably will drop it.
