Shouldn't you have better things to do once you've made it? Makes me reconsider wanting to make it, if a mountain of cash and a legion of fans aren't enough to take your attention away from the hate your parents and childhood environment passed on to you, even for just a day.  Comics like to use humor to say things they actually feel but would otherwise never get away with. Not all of them, but Anthony certainly is a wolf in sheep's clothing in this respect. When he was on O&A, especially with Patrice there, the assumption from the audience was that it was all just for laughs. And his team covered for him, again and again, sometimes risking guilt by association (just to protect the show from his fallout).  When pushed against a wall, Anthony's personal convictions come spilling out like pus. And now there's no one to protect him from himself.   Anthony is all-in with the racism. Everything he publishes has an anti-black, pro-white spin on it. Everything. I specifically looked for any kind of exceptions, and found not a single, solitary one.  This is why no radicals can be taken seriously.   We don't need a white Spike Lee making things worse for both sides."

For one thing, he would have needed to know that the guy was a subscriber, and he would have needed his real name to cross-reference it with his sub records. And if he already had his real name, there would have been plenty of other ways to doxx him."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,panjshirlion,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:24 2015 UTC,Guy probably had his real name on his Twitter so Ant looked through his subscribers. Honestly it was probably easiest to do it that way.

opieandanthony,3e1r5f,panjshirlion,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true enough but I think he got started on his subscribers and then got the other details through the regular means. That being said, doxxing is the shittiest thing you can do to someone."

Get some help.  Daddy isn't going to love you, he's dead."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,hautebird,8,Tue Jul 21 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Dude already burned all of his 'voice of personal freedom' cred. He is a terrible representative of the gun rights movement based on his anger, emotional instability, and inability to articulate points. He whines about taxes and the government taking his rights, but is the biggest cop apologist around. His best friend has verbalized rights abuses that he committed while on the job and purportedly continued to use his role to solicit favors after retiring. Personal freedom is a term he likes to throw around, but he is nothing more than a big gov Republican, who thinks he's a free-thinking radical because he lives in that bubble of a Long Island mansion."

TACS is threatening my livelihood!"
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,DuckSpeaker_,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"1) people have already showed up to his house. He's already had derranged stalkers (men and women, not just dramatic twitter women)  2) he didn't release the guy's info, just dm'd him so the guy knew he was watching  3) he didn't take away anyone's freedom, he just let the guy know he knew who he was and where he was."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,DeafandMutePenguin,7,Tue Jul 21 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"1) Without knowing what was said I can't make a definitive comment on that either way.  If someone said ""I'll kill you"" or ""I know where you live"" it does change things. If it was ""you bombed at the roast"" he's a piece of shit.  2) Irrelevant. It's not the act so much as it is presenting that as a viable retaliatory option when he has access to personal information of his listeners.   3) I didn't say he did. But that type of behavior to me is emblematic of the type of soft-tyranny and soft-fascism that the Gawker types use."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,hautebird,0,Tue Jul 21 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"I truly don't know why he lives there. He claims to hate everything that defines Long Island, New York. Of course 80% of the fanboys on this board know where he lives, but he is more in danger from Dominic or an ex than he is from any of them, just like I'm more likely to killed by an acquaintance than some random internet troll.  He experiences no benefit from his location, other than it feeds his Stockholm Syndrome and has a good number of white trash skanks. He gets gridlock, no privacy, and the worst laws in the country. He makes references to what a shit piece of geography it is, everything from Mastic to Bretton Woods. I know we are an elite group here, but who other than me laughed at a Bretton Woods at Exit 63 joke?  If the show were his priority, he could do it from his basement in Idaho. If the Manhattan studio were a priority, he could live in northeast Pennsylvania and travel in just as fast. If celeb interviews are the angle, he could get a Los Angeles studio and drive in from Arizona for the amount of time he actually works and would actually be using it. If the skanks were a priority, there is always Florida, Philly, and Ohio."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,Elagens,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:50 2015 UTC,1) So you are making a judgement without knowing all the facts.  See your own #3.  2) If he was threatened then it was a totally viable option and giving the guy a chance to stop is actually pretty reasoned  3) Gawker makes judgements and releases info without care to how either affect people.  Ant did neither.
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,DeafandMutePenguin,3,Tue Jul 21 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Be more obtuse, you can't.  He's not going to let you hang out at the pool with skagged out 4s, so relax.  We have no reason to think he was in any way threatened. If more on that comes to light, sure, I'll reconsider."
opieandanthony,3e1r5f,hautebird,0,Tue Jul 21 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"1) I don't want to hang out at the pool.  Just enjoy a show.  2) ""If more comes to light"" - THE FULL FACTS AREN'T TO LIGHT.  Ant said it was more than personal attacks.  There's several people who saw the tweets saying they included threats.  We do have reason to believe he was threatened because the fans have already crossed the line before (hell this thread routinely talks of ""turning him in to authorities"").  You are making a judgement without all the facts.  That makes you a Gawker-Cunt."

But we have no idea he got it from a subscriber. We have no idea if he got it from Keith (which I highly doubt Keith can at this point anyway).  Most likely, his actual name was found on his twitter, or something connected to his twitter.  You can then just pay Intelius, Peoplesmart, or Anywho, like $10 and get all that information, legally. An ex of mine found out where I lived and my phone number from this. Millions of people use it. It's usually public domain. Hell, you can pay for a strangers divorce papers online (for a fee) to see why they separated. People underestimate how available information is.  Either way, it's a douche move, but I just highly doubt he went into the subscribers database after finding his name, and looked there. It's very easy to do it legally online in a couple minutes.   To reiterate my point to the ground, it was a total asshole move. And I know it's fun every day to go on reddit and see another trainwreck to talk about because our lives are depressing. But I think Anthony did this legally.   Hell, the guy might of had his information online somewhere for free anyway. Who the fuck knows.  PS: He tweeted he got it from public records. Which is the equivalent of using an online company to find the information. As much as I love this Real Housewives drama, I have to believe him."

He will take it out on those who already subscribe because there is no one else to. He's not very good at placing his anger in the right place and most likely views ""the fans"" as a singular entity.   Some people might even like that he's the guy who resents his fans. But if it's something you don't like, I predict it will only get worse"

opieandanthony,3e1npl,JohnTravoltasHair,12,Tue Jul 21 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"Well an ""AMA"" might clear up whether or not he is actually a ""scum fuck.""  If the guy was just busting Anthony's balls about doing a shit job at the roast that wouldn't really make him that much of a piece of shit.  Ant might as well just cross over to Jimmy's ""anybody who posts anything online shouldn't be allowed to be anonymous"" way of thinking."

opieandanthony,3e1npl,JohnTravoltasHair,-12,Tue Jul 21 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"Because I don't think they were in a state of mind, or opinion about Ant, to give an unbiased telling of what happened to begin with. It's safe to assume that since he only did it to that one person, yet this entire subreddit is trashing him, that those comments were exclusively personal.   In any case the idea is stupid, anyway, since the guy was persuaded out of further contact with Ant over the threat of Ant, too, getting personal. Why would he then come here and write a novel for you guys?"
opieandanthony,3e0q33,YouAintGotToLieCraig,117,Tue Jul 21 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"This has made me dislike Ant more than anything he has done. This is the same guy who would rip people apart for a living, made fun of Terry Schiavo, laughed at Tammy Faye when she was withering away from cancer, so many deplorable things he's said, but he can't handle people saying he bombed at a roast? He's such a sensitive fucking hypocrite, I feel embarrassed for ever subscribing to his horrendous podcast."
opieandanthony,3e0q33,RearNakedGrope,44,Tue Jul 21 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"you sum up some really amazing points on why I fucking turned to hate Anthony.   I am really enjoying seeing him go down in flames, to be honest."

opieandanthony,3e0q33,RearNakedGrope,79,Tue Jul 21 10:01:01 2015 UTC,"So he got Keith to get one of his cop buddies to abuse his power and find out someone's personal information,so he can DM him the guys address because he made fun of him for bombing? Lol Whata bitch"

They don't realize it because it's usually just a small bit of info given out per tweet. If you comb through a bunch of tweets, you can find out a lot.  Twitter also has a ""website"" section on its profile so most people will put a site there, even if it's just some small crappy personal site. If they aren't blocking whois data for the site, it's an instant dox (this likely happened to Soder). A lot of people don't know what whois is or don't want to pay extra for it."

opieandanthony,3e0q33,juicypekka,4,Tue Jul 21 09:55:33 2015 UTC,"Morals aside, Twitter is pretty much Anthony's only weakness. He is the perfect organism, the Xenomorph of child molesters."

The lack of awareness was definitely Opie-esque. It's a horrible thing in its own right, but given the context it's truly baffling. I've defended Anthony the past couple months over the quality of the show and most recently his roast set, but this was ""beyond the pale"" as they say."
opieandanthony,3e0q33,fratboy_massacre,69,Tue Jul 21 06:16:07 2015 UTC,"Goddamn, he really is a total cunt. Threatens to doxx someone for criticizing him on Twitter. And then acts like a badass about it. Oh yeah, Ant! You really got him, tough guy! Pathetic, thin-skinned pussy. He'll probably have Keith rough him up. God knows he'd never do it himself.   At this point, all his bullshit about not bombing is just completely pathetic. ""I tripped on my dick going up there, yeah...."" You ate your dick the whole time, you fucking crybaby. Go ahead, ask some more of your professional comedian friends how well you did. Doesn't even have the sense to be embarrassed. I hope he shoots himself soon."
opieandanthony,3e0q33,DuckSpeaker_,58,Tue Jul 21 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"He'll probably have Keith rough him up.   God I'd fucking love for this to happen.  Ant and Keith live in the most pathetically isolated world, a world where fucking twitter comments upset them and where Keith has some kind of real power over other people.  Nothing would make me happier than someone who identifies them-self as Keith ""The Cop"" to confront me in real life.   These two sacks of gravel are seriously deluded enough to think that they have some kind of hard power outside of property that Anthony owns.  Ant jerks himself off over his right to strap a gun to himself in his own house but seems to forget that there are people out there who won't hesitate to take it a step farther. I am not one of those people, and I don't have a hard on for guns or threatening people like Ant or Keith, but I'd have no moral dilemma about laying that fat blowhard out cold if he actually personally sought me out. I'm sure that his Cop connections will go real far here in Michigan.   Are they stupid enough to think no one else in the world is friends with a cop.. I dont get it...   At this point I wish Ant would have gotten a real ass beating last July. He's such an ignorant motherfucker with no sense of what he deserves, what he's entitled to, or what people are capable of doing when threatened.  Have fun spending your remaining 5 or 6 years hiding in your ""complex"" telling yourself that a gun in your briefs makes you invincible. A lot of good it did you when some whore on the street was capable of getting in your face and ruining your life you shit eating coward.  Oh and also you bombed last week by the way.

From a forum post from 2008:   The below two threads contain all the crap but the bottom line is that ""allegedly"" Anthony got so pissed at Doug for his antics or ""turning against the show"" and allowing certain shit on his board that he got his personal information (Full name, address, phone number and the kicker SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER) from a form doug filled out or the copy of his license they got from things he had to fill out when visiting the studio. He then PM'd that information to that cunt frenchy and told her to start posting it. It was posted in paltalk multiple times with over 80 something people in the room.

So someone criticizes you/makes fun of you and you respond not with a comeback, but with the same thing that some other asshole did?  That's incredibly fucked up.

opieandanthony,3e0q33,kgt5003,31,Tue Jul 21 04:27:23 2015 UTC,Yeah but don't worry.. that isn't what he was doing.  Soder gave Ant too much credit there.  That is a joke that Ant has made in the past when describing incredibly white rooms/audiences.  He just reused a joke he has used before and since a black person was there and Soder is funny he thought the joke must be that Ant is calling the black guy a chimp.  In reality it was just a call back to when Ant was on the white supremacist podcast where they were talking about how NASA put a man on the moon with a control room full of white engineers.
opieandanthony,3e0q33,xxmikekxx,16,Tue Jul 21 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Yea that's what I thought too. Just the same shit he always says.  The line was ""this room is very diverse - looks like the 50s space program"".   it followed a ""lots of white people at blacks lives matter rallies"" so it seems it would make sense that it was just his boring point about how the 50s space program were all white that he makes over & over again. I think he'd have to address the 1 black guy first for it to make sense that it was a chimp joke. But would he know joke logistics with how incompetent his set was overall?"
opieandanthony,3e0q33,kgt5003,22,Tue Jul 21 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah if it was actually a joke to call the black guy a chimp he'd have to add on to it ""So I guess you know what that makes you, black guy's name that I can't remember."" or something to that effect.  Every time one of his jokes didn't land he started nervously explaining it as if that would get the laugh so if he was really trying to call the black guy a chimp he definitely would have explained that after it bombed."

opieandanthony,3e1sz9,chris2webby,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:17 2015 UTC,Is our personal info actually at risk if we're subscribed to TACS?   Your title reminds me of the News Tease bit they  used to do back in the XM days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zmSgFJcbUA
opieandanthony,3e1sz9,anonimescu,3,Tue Jul 21 11:45:41 2015 UTC,Some points to make on the technical side of things:   Ant's website has the necessary security certificates. Ant himself is not a programmer and cannot get past what the programmers / DBAs have set up without asking them to join him in committing crimes with subscriber data. Ant's website had to be set up with proper encryption to even achieve the security certificate. The proper encryption of SSN / billing info... etc.   Ant's only recourse for tapping our data would be to collude with a hacker who could get the info anonymously. I really doubt he's going to go through all of this to profit off of our info.  One weirder option he could use is maybe asking one of the database people to pull reports for him. Reports including user information so he can start a... email campaign? So I guess he could get our emails / addresses etc. through that angle if he wanted to try and scare us with our own info??
opieandanthony,3e1sz9,furmp,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:24 2015 UTC,I would say he probably can't get your info. The website and billing are most likely handled third party. Just don't directly interact with him and you'll be fine.

opieandanthony,3e1sz9,Shabotly,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest. We know the man isn't going to go crazy and start releasing the private info of paying customers. There is an understandable fear when you see a guy do something like this but logically it doesn't make sense for him to start fucking over his customers like that. Still it's a scumbag thing to do, even if you're not handling the private info of a lot of people.   Doxxing is like Swatting and all of those other shitty little smarmy Internet things. They're annoying but at least somewhat understandable when a little kid with no understanding of consequences does them but for a middle aged man to threaten that in response to insults is downright pathetic. Although I'm pretty sure it's the fact that Ant is getting on in years and doesn't understand a lot of modern things that allows him to miss that threatening to doxx a person is not some cute little joke but a very serious and very harmful thing, however you came by their info."

Dr. Venter and other researchers say that those traits most commonly used to distinguish one race from another, like skin and eye color, or the width of the nose, are traits controlled by a relatively few number of genes, and thus have been able to change rapidly in response to extreme environmental pressures during the short course of Homo sapiens history."

opieandanthony,3e059t,Colin_Quinn,35,Tue Jul 21 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"Once you've seen this, you can really piece it together in the original video.    He's looking over at Opie to try and get his attention, then looking up at his screen at what he's just typed out, he has his finger on the mouse and then you can hear the mouse click at 0:06 (sending it over to Opie), then he looks over at Opie again but Opie obviously hasn't noticed what he's sent over to his screen, so he sends him a quick IM just to alert Opie which he probably has queued up - as he doesn't just look down at his phone, he scrolls down slightly and then presses it.      Then, he sees that Opie is reading it, look at his eyes at 0:24, he's looking at where you would imagine Opie would be holding his phone in his other hand and then looking away. At this point if you turn it up loud, you can hear some noise (presumably from behind the camera as there is no movement anywhere else) which is Opie putting his phone back down, or back into his pocket.    Then, like OP drew attention to, he fingers his wedding ring just as Opie is saying the joke he's just sent him. As someone who turned up occasionally to a Communication Studies class in college, I can tell you that (outside of the context of being in the presence of your partner) that means you are ""anxious about something that is going to happen soon"" (random source to back it up).    You can also see in the video that it's just the right amount of time for Opie to pick up his phone, read the joke and then put it back down and say it. Also, after the joke, the Stangel doesn't laugh like the others, but he still knows he's on camera, so he puts on a very obviously fake smile which is more of a grimace.    This is what I think is going on, obviously one or both of these Jews have been hired to write jokes. But, I think that Jimmy is not in on it. Hence the weird remodeling of the studio where everyone is facing Opie, except the one guy sitting behind everyone with his screened turned away into the corner of the room, hence the way he's trying to do it all secretly knowing that he's on camera, hence the need for this one to be mostly quiet while he's in studio - as he's busy writing.   I wouldn't be surprised if Opie reads this or is told about it on Twitter and then takes the video down and tries to pretend it never happened like he does with his video fails."
opieandanthony,3e059t,DoubleGuns,17,Tue Jul 21 00:41:20 2015 UTC,I agree completely but Jimmy has to know.  He's sat in a room with Opie for a decade.  He knows how hes almost incapable of telling a joke.  He can also see him reading from his phone.  Jimmy isn't stupid.
opieandanthony,3e059t,Clown_Shoe,3,Tue Jul 21 01:01:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point. Jimmy must know. How enraging it must be for him to sit there and laugh at Opie's jokes that he knows someone else wrote for him."

We are disappointed that the guy who claimed to want to do this amazing show ended up ranting in his basement about black people and politics in an even more idiotic way than regular pundits already do.  And now this roast thing is just the final piece of the puzzle for a lot of people, myself included.  How he's handling this is weird.  But DeRosa and Opie were wrong first, I think."

This part isn't in dispute at all.  He is the one who said that.  He didn't actually post it to the public... he showed it to the person in a private message to let him know that he could release it publicly.  There is nothing illegal about that.  Phone numbers and addresses are not protected private information.  You can find that shit on the internet or in a phone book.  Spike Lee posted an address on Twitter of somebody who he thought was George Zimmerman's family's address along with a message to go and kill him and it turned out to be an unrelated old couple's address and they sued him and could barely make a case.  Spike Lee tweeted that shit out to his over 100,000 followers with a message to go to the house and kill the person and he settled out of court for 10k.

I guess they see them as competition.   They have had dozens of anti reddit posts since (i think it really started with) ""The Fappening"" and have labeled reddit as a misogynistic, racist hate site and have had to have trolled through thousands and thousands of posts to find quotes and posts that fit their narrative. Condé Nast bought reddit in like 2010 and even though reddit has spun off into its own entity I guess Gawker doesnt give a care and have them pegged as marked men. I guess this goes as far as outing Nasts CFO and his private life.   fuck them in the ear."

opieandanthony,3dzdqm,rottenseed,-3,Tue Jul 21 00:17:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's one point, but the fact of the matter is those spergs are funny motherfuckers and make lots of original content simply because there's no way to whore yourself for credit or fame. Just count how many useless ""THAT'S THE BIT!"", sniff, ""greggshells"", bad Chips, etc are in every thread.   I argue if profiles and point systems didn't exist, you'd see a lot less of this stupid bullshit and much more fun stuff to read. And practically every day this website exists demonstrates that fact."
opieandanthony,3dzdqm,KenFrezno,2,Tue Jul 21 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"99% of it is garbage.  Just like every other site with user generated content.  There's no difference between reddit and any other part of the internet.  The subreddits are so diverse,  you get different people in every one.  You even said yourself you use 4chan.  You think you're the only one on reddit that has?  You think you're some sort of ambassador?"
opieandanthony,3dzdqm,rahtin,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"If you can't tell that there's a clear difference in quality and unwritten hack self-censorship active between 4chan and Reddit, then you've never browsed both sites. There's a reason Reddit thinks and uses the jokes 4chan makes it use.  Step 1. Lurk the internet for hot jokes  Step 2. Share it on Reddit to plagiarize content and receive free points and recognition  Step 3. Watch as stolen material gets integrated as your own  Step 4. Start to feel like Reddit is ""producing"" content when in reality it's producing as much content as rats that scavenge over-flowing garbage pins  Step 5. Brain rewards you with dopamine when you laugh with all the usernames you recognize from your favorite subs  This is standard kike shit to make you consume culture instead of creating it."

As far as we can tell, evolution is an utterly wasteful, goal-less, trial-and-error, chips-on-every-number gamble where a ""win"" is...whatever happens. The idea that ""good birth"" can be correctly judged and consciously selected—especially by the kind of fucks who have the power/desire to distort selection—is ""not even wrong,"" as assholes say. There is no ""good,"" unless ""good"" means ""whatever.""  All the unpleasant-looking ""HBD""/Bell Curve stats about IQ, crime, reproduction rates, etc. are as accurate as stats can be. What they mean is that violent black dumbasses and the ant-like Chinee are superior to the ""better"" people they outbreed—or else they wouldn't outbreed them. Q.E.Darwin. What they are works. What the rest of us are kinda doesn't.  Africans happen so much that the most reviled supervillain of fifteen years ago, Bill Gates, is considered a great man now because he's trying to sterilize the entire continent, trying to thwart evolution because it favors people walking around with baskets full of smoked bats on their heads over people like ""us.""  ""How dare—!""  Fuck you. That's why he's doing it, and that's why people love it. Real racism, the kind that piles up corpses. Even in this clip, Anthony's not that kind of fuck.  His take on HBD material is like a smoker pointing to the stats that show smoking prevents Parkinson's. He's a vice-level racist. It's a habit that makes his day feel better. So he justifies it every day. As Stanhope has pointed out, vices are self-punishing. You smoke, you get cancer. You start talking bell curve without knowing your Darwin, without a grounding in natural philosophy and/or a moral principle that clearly separates you from Hitler, without Sanger's press agent or Gates's supervillain money...shit whatever happens."

opieandanthony,3dzcta,Beavis_vs_theFeds,9,Mon Jul 20 19:31:06 2015 UTC,I still enjoy the old stuff a lot. I'm really just more sad than anything while listening. They really pissed away a great radio show in their own ways.   My opinion of Opie has changed a lot as Ant has spiraled out of control. He still annoys me but I feel bad that he had to deal with Ant the last 5 years. I don't blame him at all if he didn't fight for Ant now. Ant's alcoholism and racism had the show in constant danger. It has to be a relief for Opie and Jim to not deal with him on a daily basis anymore.

They even acknowledge that sometimes.   Stuff that's ruined for me are    Ant's impressions. He's driven all them into the ground.  The old race discussions with Patrice. For a long time I believed Ant was really just a class snob with mild racism, and criticized blacks because they were the underclass, not for any real race reasons. Now I realize even in his racism he has no depth. He's just a fucking cliched racist wop.  Being able to dish it out, but not take it.

He took some shit from his fans so now he is changing his story.  All he has to do is show the personal attacks he took (and personal attacks are different from threats...

Shock Jock radio died which is why it doesn't exist anymore.  SiriusXM's stock holder report said so itself.  Sports and Political talk are the big money makers.

opieandanthony,3e0nbd,opieisdumb,0,Tue Jul 21 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"and Why are still mad at Derosa? Now it seems like he was a tad ahead of his time, not siding with Ant. LOL ant turned out to be a piece of shit and IS a racist (monkey sounds over riots) his show is horrible and he has done so many things to show he is a bitch.  Derosa should be exonerated  EDIT: Derosa is still a bitch, I dug deeper on the issue."

Honestly, you act like Burr and others: just say nothing if you greatly appreciate what he's done for you but strongly disagree with how he's conducting himself. Don't vouch for him, but don't trash him either. You act like a man, not like a bitch as Derosa did"
opieandanthony,3e0nbd,SpudsCuckley,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:32 2015 UTC,Same could be said about what Ant did to Opie.

opieandanthony,3e0nbd,opieisdumb,0,Tue Jul 21 04:19:29 2015 UTC,How did this whole hting come about?  Did someone ask Derosa for his opinion on the Ant thing a while back? Did he just blurt out his comments? whats the background.
opieandanthony,3e0nbd,opieisdumb,4,Tue Jul 21 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"He was on Rogan & Rogan was talking about Anthony & then Derosa goes ""yknow...I haven't talked about this publicly..."" & then started trashing Anthony. & it would've been one thing to call him a racist but it really turned into Joe crying about not getting a text back from him"

All he does is agree with everything, no opinions of his own, laugh at everything being said, speak just to hear his voice, adds nothing, turns everything about race and has a stereotypical view where every single white person is racist but he can say whatever he wants because he's black.  However, the worst part of all is he just isn't funny.  He goes multiple appearances without saying 1 funny thing.  I understand he's friends with them off the air and they like him and I'm sure Opie likes him on air because he fills dead air with his nonsense and agrees with Opie's contrarian view on every topic but COME ON.

Really, when's the last time you saw Kindler in ""the media?"" My most recent memory of him on TV is from the early '90s. The standup world coddles him and nurtures his delusion—and the press that covers standup goes to him because he's the same kind of parasite/cop they are—but that's a tiny world.  He is representative of What's Wrong With The Business, but ""Jews run it"" isn't what's wrong. ""It won't cut its tumors off"" is."

opieandanthony,3dwdnc,TriangleDimes,14,Mon Jul 20 10:20:42 2015 UTC,"The correct answer to this accusation is: so?  Let's say they are focusing on Islam - even though Maher and Dawkins reserved a huge chunk of their pasts going after Catholicism and Christianity - what does that mean? Why is it bigoted now? Where was Kindler during Religulous?  At first I thought it was a bit or a weak troll attempt, but reading his responses he sounds serious. He is seeking an authority figure to go after another comedian. This is some next-level hack bullshit."
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,panjshirlion,12,Mon Jul 20 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"It all fits into the classic progressive categorization of punching up and punching down.  Christianity is largely the religion of the West. The West is powerful. Therefor, criticizing Christianity is punching up, which is good.  Islam is the religion of the Middle East. The Middle East is dependent. Therefor, criticizing Islam is punching down, which is bad.  Nevermind that they're both belief systems and, as such, should be completely open to discussion and criticism in a free society. Nope. If a religion is practiced by a marginalized group, then that's part of their identity, and criticism of someone's identity is bigotry."
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,Unc_PaulHarrgis1-5YO,6,Mon Jul 20 02:55:38 2015 UTC,Fuck the middle east being dependent.  They have enough oil money to feed the planet.  They can go fuck themselves.

opieandanthony,3dwdnc,BeerCanThick,9,Mon Jul 20 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"For Kindler, Muslims equal Arab minorities that he can coddle and stick up for and score Good Boy Points. He gets to flaunt how morally superior he is to everybody, and signal that he has the social status and financial capability to not be threatened by Muslims.  The antipathy against Christianity from a Jew is no big surprise, then add in the fact that to his simplistic mind, Christian=White, even though a majority of Christians are not White and there are almost more non-White Christians than Muslims of any race or ethnicity.  Remember when the people Kindler tweeted about talked about Islamic violence with Affleck and he immediately tried to take it to a race issue and an anti-Semitic issue? That is how these lefty dum-dums really think about religion. Islam=Arab (somebody forgot to tell Indonesia) and Christianity=European White. That means you have the green light to shit on Christianity but Islam is inviolable."

I've heard Dipaolo and Norton go as far as to say he's legitimately funny. I understand that burning potential bridges by bashing other comics can fuck up your career, but what could Andy Kindler ever do to them? I'm convinced he keeps dirt on other comics to blackmail them with like Scientology.   The fact that he gets to do that ""State of the Industry"" speech at Just For Laughs every year instead of someone like Colin Quinn is bullshit."

These guys shit on all religions, they just focus on islam cuz (a) it is BY FAR the worst, most violent one, and (b) dumb cunts like Kindler and Affleck are dumb enough to defend it.  All yA gotta do is watch the last Vice episode of this season (it was either the final episode or 2nd to last) it was about Saudi Arabia, and then about ISIS. Watch that and pretend everything's the same. This shit is bizarre fellas. Maher is the only liberal left with some fucking balls it seems"
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,Unc_PaulHarrgis1-5YO,6,Mon Jul 20 16:00:32 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the point that Dawkins makes. Yes, Christianity isn't good BUT Islam is worse.

opieandanthony,3dwdnc,erockarmy1,7,Mon Jul 20 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"He's the worst. Everyone who disagrees with him is a racist or a bigot.   ""Racist"" went from being an actual condemnation of an awful kind of behavior to the well-used bludgeon of the extreme left to smash its enemies.   I don't even think it's ""left-wing"" anymore, it's just this weird spitefulness at how things are. It's weird but it's so rampant that it is frightening."
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,3DXYZ,6,Mon Jul 20 02:56:34 2015 UTC,"Andy Kinder is seriously defending islam? A terrorist death cult. Way to pick your sides Andy. Religion is horse shit, and anyone defending religion is a fucking moron no matter what their ideas of fairness are. Religion is nonsense. Andy Kindler is just dumb."
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,kevin121312,8,Mon Jul 20 07:03:35 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with religion. Muslims are people of color. So in Andy's left wing mind, they must be defended above all else. He says nothing when Atheists go after Christians. He is a phony little worm with a pretty big double standard.  The kooky left for some reason loves to suck Muslim cock even though they disagree with them on just about everything except Israel. They were actually for the guys who tried to kill everyone in Texas over a bunch of cartoons. Progressives would not last 10 seconds in a Muslim country. It is a very weird relationship. And people like Maher are right to point out how dangerous and hypocritical it is for the left to be always defending Islam while they shit on Christianity.   It is also hilarious to see all these American Muslim bitches screaming how progressive they are while running around with a towel over their heads and fasting for some stupid made up holiday. Then defending some Muslim guy who just killed five U.S. soldiers because it appeased some god."
opieandanthony,3dwdnc,GaB91,2,Mon Jul 20 09:58:43 2015 UTC,"While I agree there are progressives who are extremely embarrassing and unreasonable... I am a progressive.

Yeah, I'm sure they'll get right on that.  What a faggot this guy is. The only thing these three have in common is that they detest religion, and rightfully point to Islam as the most violent and dangerous of these religions.  I'm guessing he considers that racist.

opieandanthony,3dwqpw,sanfrancisco69er,18,Mon Jul 20 06:47:21 2015 UTC,The roast as a whole was fuckin great.  I laughed harder during that roast than I have at any TACS or any O&A show from the last couple of years.  It was consistently funny.  Ant is only taking shit because his set was awful and he wouldn't admit it.  If he just admitted that he bombed and then broke down his set and made fun of himself it would have been great.  Instead he went into denial and got shit on for it.
opieandanthony,3dwqpw,kgt5003,7,Mon Jul 20 11:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really liked that one about how Soder was like an ""enigma machine"". Get it? Because Opie and Jim can't communicate.  The line about being the only legal gun owner with an afro was top notch observational humor mixed with a dash of self-depreciation (as any good comic would do). What a hoot!

Ant didn't really ""put on the roast"". The roast was happening way before LoS joined TACS. Anthony just allowed it to be broadcast on his network, which was a no-brainer once LoS joined TACS. The roast itself was planned before they joined TACS, and was organized primarily by Rebecca and Christine. LoS were already thinking of broadcasting it (albeit lower quality) on their own, using the setup they had been using pre-TACS. Anthony didn't get shit for the entire roast anyway.  Pretty much everyone said the roast in general was great. Anthony got shit for refusing to admit that he did poorly."

opieandanthony,3e0tpd,krbin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:39 2015 UTC,Well Ant did DeRosa jokes at the roast even though he wasn't there so if DeRosa responds when Ant isn't there it's fair play.  I doubt he will say anything though.  I don't think he's looking to get dragged back down into that sorta mess again.
opieandanthony,3e0tpd,kgt5003,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't know that. Couldn't stand watching the roast because it looks like it was filmed in somebody's mom's garage. That is kinda shitty."
opieandanthony,3e0tpd,krbin,4,Tue Jul 21 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"His Derosa jokes didn't even make any sense.  They weren't funny... He was making fun of the way Joe looks and said something like ""DeRosa looks like he was made the same way a transgender person has their dick turned into a vagina.. With one of those inverted skin type surgeries.  He also looks like a drawing an autistic kid would do at therapy trying to draw the man his mother is sleeping with.  I don't even know what that means but it's HILARIOUS!""  It was clumsily worded and nonsensical (and he actually said that last part about not even knowing what it means but it's hilarious.. Those are his words; not mine).  Needless to say they fell flat."

O&A would like people to believe they have millions of listeners, but I think level-headed estimates put it at a few hundred thousand. I think that's a fair number for a paid subscription model.  So how many people subscribe to the Anthony Cumia Network? We don't know, but let's throw out a number that seems realistic. 10,000? I think Ant could get 10,000 people subscribing based on his previous fame and his newfound fame with more hardcore right-wing people (and maybe a decent amount of White Supremacists.) That's a fraction of what he had before.  So 10,000 subscribers at just under $8.00 a month? That puts him at $80,000 in revenue per month.  That's $960,000 per year, and that's not including previous savings and whatever the fuck else (most of the network infrastructure seemed to be already in place.)  I don't give a fuck about his finances one way or another but for a former tin-knocker turned racist ornery pedophile, I think he's doing okay. I think he can afford the rent on that place and still be pulling a profit. Let's also remember that he brought on a previously free podcast to join the network, along a controversial and altogether disgraced Canadian provocateur. I don't think he's paying a lot for the talent, although I could be wrong."

Plus, he knows that it's do or die time.  I like ant, but I don't see this show lasting another year unless they do something really different and ant's 'friends' have an intervention.  I realize that his beer-fetching, average joe friends love his racist rants, but they like the free food, beer and use of his pool more.  They should sit him down and get him help to stop drinking and doing what other shit he's doing. Otherwise, they're gonna have to start fetching beers for LOS and hope that Jay Oakerson likes them as much as ant does."

If that's 10% of his listeners, then that means he has about 250 listeners. And half of them don't pay.   Total it up, and you're looking at revenue around $10,000 per year."
opieandanthony,3dveaa,majestik6,4,Mon Jul 20 03:17:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense to use Reddit followers as a barometer for his popularity. That's true for any show, but especially something like TACS. Game of Thrones has 8 million confirmed viewers and the sub has just north of 500k subscribers. Plus, Reddit isn't his demographic. Fuck, Opie is making millions per year on his show and have a look at that sub.   Ant plays more to the Republican side and the Rush Limbaugh sub has 170 subscribers despite being one of the biggest and most profitable shows on AM radio. I'm saying that if very conservative estimates are to be believed, O&A only had a few hundred thousand and he would need only a fraction of that to be making a lot of money from subscribers. I am also saying that even though everyone here mocks him for the race talk, that probably opened him up to the Stormfront demographic and a bigger bracket of retarded truckers."

I am assuming that he has his house paid for, so I could be completely wrong. Even factoring in the ex wife/whore taking a couple million, the pool, the shelby, the theater.....he has made millions.

opieandanthony,3dveaa,NashuaDan,2,Mon Jul 20 11:51:59 2015 UTC,"Let's look at the finance part of this...  Average office space in NYC is in the neighborhood of $50 sq/ft.  Given the pictures posted, it looks like it's at least 5,000 sq ft.  That'd make rent alone $250,000 a year, PLUS utilities, PLUS equipment, PLUS construction (unless that was folded into the lease sq/ft price), PLUS whatever additional staff he'd need, PLUS having to sign a 3-5 year minimum term lease.   So this means one of two things:  1) Anthony has tons of money in the bank even with his reckless lavish lifestyle and still has no problem dumping a couple million dollars into a sinking ship with no real revenue and no one here knows what they're talking about.  2) Anthony's subscriber numbers (and growth trend) are high enough to justify dumping a couple million dollars into a studio, still live his reckless lavish lifestyle and no one here knows what they're talking about."
opieandanthony,3dveaa,poundfoolishhh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"3) It's only 2,000 sq ft, only requires a 1-2 year lease, limited additional equipment and staff given he'd probably move the majority of what he has to the main office, thus a much smaller investment than your estimate. Not quite the risk you mention, and a more likely middle ground between having endless subscribers and being a sinking ship."

opieandanthony,3dveaa,OpiesBreasts,0,Mon Jul 20 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"There is now a dawgshed-esque element of ""point of no return""-hatred towards Anthony here, as evidenced by the upvotes for gsbird's comment, the downvotes for yours, as well as the glee with which this sub pounced on Ant's bombing at the Big Jay roast, and his refusal to acknowledge the bombing.    Even if Anthony manages to claw himself out of the hole he's dug for himself, some people will keep trying to throw him back in it.  And even if things do start to go well (funny) for TACS, there will always be something to complain about, and you can bet it will be, disproportionately.  It's pointless to try to reason with this mentality; some people need to hate Anthony from now on, no matter what he does.  To a portion of O&A's (former) fan base, it's completely immaterial what Anthony does from now on; he's on the ""hate"" list, and he ain't gettin' off it."

Edit: (Update) I was curious about Scorch's current radio job and it looks like his show is streaming right now.  You can also check out his description on that link, which seems to paint a hacky ""I was rescued from a shitty job"" background.  It also looks like he's still doing the Brain Cell Stimulator and a version of WEIRD NEWS!  There's also a phone number for the show on his facebook, 1-855-456-7625, which definitely shouldn't be used for any joking purposes.  In all seriousness he's probably be happy to see a phone line light up for once, though.  TL;DR: Call 1-855-456-7625 and ask for the return of Douche or Dressing®!"

I find Anthony and Norton and even Opie more interesting than most of the famous faggot actors they feel like they have to cater to.

She might as well have said ""nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"".  She's clearly in ""do you know who I am?!?"" territory.

She was a comic who wants to be more than just a comic so she is moving up in the world.  I don't personally find her funny but why does everyone care that she's getting famous?  She never swore off fame or Hollywood.   Norton is the one who trashed apologies and Hollywood and then defended Schumer's apology and ran off to be in her Hollywood movie when he got the chance (although he wound up getting cut).

When the Sopranos was airing all he ever said about it was how Melfi scenes suck, and he said it EVERY single monday after an episode.

opieandanthony,3durko,juicypekka,-6,Sun Jul 19 19:48:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the solution to all this race bullshit: go full-Abrahamic up in this mug. Go back to old school Christianity or better yet, convert to fundie Islam. Once this catches on, we can make a few minor adjustments: start deporting gays, legislate respect for the elders, and rid your home of TV's, PC's and most other modern-day appliances of convenience so that your broads are kept busy at home.  That last part would be the hardest and the most important part, because it keeps your ladies' vulnerable little brains too occupied to be corrupted by the conniving juden and his propaganda machine. Before you know it, your girl will be trying to convert other women: ""duuude, you got your laundry, you got your sweeping and dusting, you've given birth to seven kids - boom, no time for feminism!"" Women really are happy doing simple, menial labor - some even do it as a form of therapy! Not that your lady will need therapy, because her psyche will remain undamaged by threatening displays like ""manspreading"" and ""microaggression,"" because she will never have seen the inside a train or an office. And speaking of giving birth to seven kids: no more need for no fucking immigrants. Problem solved. No race is oppressed, there's no racial conflict, and everyone is happy as a pig in shit. Why? Because if all the broads are forced to cover up and sit at home, men of all races will get along, and agree to be separate but equal.   Each day, I'm beginning to think that Islam really is the way you guys. Then again, in full disclosure, I also forgot to pick up my Seroquel two days ago, and now I'm flying through space and time like a fucking flying squirrel on fire."

The Commodore PET was pretty influential; I never use one because I own a far more superior ThinkPad (running Arch Linux master race). Only listening to the Beatles is more equivalent to using a typewriter and then sending notes via messenger pigeon, right into your mother's gaping asshole.

And that's kind of the gist of it.  Anthony, on the other hand, is getting deeper and deeper. In the past, him dating 17 year olds, being quasi racist was kind of fun. Like an old cute grandfather.  But now, now he is becoming a true unlikeable ghoul. A true racist if there ever was one. A creepy old man dating young girls. A liar in regards to Sam, Bennington, even sayings with Opie. A delusional old fool who wishes it was 1950's oppression. His show is the only thing, by most, the fans here have actually paid out of their pocket for. Most listened to OandA online. And if O and J was on one end of the scale and Anthony Cumia Show is on the other, the tipping point is starting to give way, favoring OandJ.  He was our idol of O and A. Our savior. The one who didn't sell out. Opie isn't funny and Jimmy has become a cuck with Gregg.  But the greater they are, the harder they fall. And Ant is tumbling down his hill at a great pace, and at this point, it's an enjoyable fall to watch."

So everyone gave him full support in his new project and then he shit all over them and slowly showed people how much of a delusional ass he is.  Listen to his greggshells episode now. Ant sounds like an angry ex-girlfriend who's blaming the end of her relationship on the guy she was with because she thinks he didn't baby her enough.

He's an abysmal broadcaster doing a boring, lukewarm program, but that's the point: that's all he's doing. Anthony, meanwhile, continues to try and ride the lightning of taking potshots at Opie/DeRosa because he thinks it will gain him favor in the eyes of the audience. It's literally childish, picking on the unpopular kid because the cheerleaders think it's cool.  Opie definitely acted like a child before; the on-air fights are a great example of that. However, since the brief aftermath of the Walking on Greggshells video, he's just been content to come in and do his job without worrying about the drama that exists outside of the airtime. And with the frequency with which Cumia beats this dead horse, it's not hard for Opie to look like the bigger man by comparison.  Opie still sucks, as he has since the beginning, but at the moment he's just blending into the background while Anthony screams racially charged tangents at center stage, flanked by an ensemble of underage groupies. That's why the heat is off of him for the time being."

We have no way of knowing how he would have reacted if he'd been axed during cakestompgate, knowing that Ant did nothing to save his job.  I agree that Ant is being an obnoxious baby, but you can't give Opie too much credit for taking the high road when he has fewer reasons to be bitter."

O&A was something, O&J is just background audio now to whatever celebrity you like that is doing the interview. I had that experience anyway recently with a Lewis Black interview they did.

opieandanthony,3dttog,WernerNepomuk,25,Sun Jul 19 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"Jimmy is very busy and even though Ant isn't technically a standup comic Jimmy couldn't watch the full 9 minutes without running the risk of accidentally being influenced by the material so he had to shut it down.    On a side note: Patrice was talked about for never writing anything down and that was super impressive.  People always talk about Luis CK being the guy who started the trend of throwing away your entire hour and starting fresh after you film your special.  Seinfeld is talked about as a guy who uses clean material but chooses his words so carefully that he can tell the same jokes more than once and get different laughs each time.  Carlin was always talked about for being super smart and political.  Cosby (pre rape outrage) was always talked about for having amazing microphone technique and timing with his long stories.  Jimmy SOOOOO desperately wants to be talked about with reverence as ""the guy who doesn't even watch any other comics ever."""

Every comic does that now because of Louis.  He might not have started it but he made it necessary now.

opieandanthony,3dxnpb,sldsnak4,4,Mon Jul 20 13:01:57 2015 UTC,That isn't true. He told a young comic that if he wanted to get better he had to stop touring with ralphie and getting high.

Often they are stuffed with a plasted flower of some sort and labeled as a ""Mystic Vase"". They can actually be used as an oil burner by simplying buying the liquid scented oil and instering into the bowl and going thru the same motions as smoking but rather then enhaling you exhale creating a wounderful smelling atmosphere.

This fucking moron nitwit Maureen and her husband might be Opie fans and supporters of Opie Radio which is fine and dandy, i guess. The problem is that King Stupid doesn't get or refuses to acknowledge is that even his 200 or so real fans understand how shallow and narcissistic he is and how easy it is to craft a tweet to him and get a retweet. His ""fans"" are faker than the people spitting insults at him.   All you have to do is say something like ""The show is better than its ever been, if you assholes dont like it than listen to something else.The channel is better than ever, Opie."" Theres a 95% chance youre going to get a response. You know why these two rocket scientists didn't tag Jimmy directly in the tweet? Because they know that Jimmy DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK about them or their stupid baby and would never even look at something so fucking desperate and needy.   As for these two sycophant mutant parents...I have yet to have children so maybe im ignorant as to how the parental mind functions but imagine birthing a child and immediately listening to Opie Radio after.. Not going out into the lobby and talking to your family, not calling friends, family and co-workers, and not enjoying the once in a lifetime moment with your life partner and spouse. Just putting on OpieRadio and hearing some horrible song open the show followed by ""Jimmy and Sherrod Small in studio...that was a little deep Credence recommended by twitter user....You like Credence, Jim?""   Even if the asshole parents did partake in what i would consider ""normal"" behavior and talk to their loved ones and enjoyed the beauty of creation together the fact that they shared their picture with Gregg ""Opie"" Hughes, a radio Jock on SXM is beyond pathetic.   That being said, they got 2 retweets and 9 favorites, which is similar to the numbers Opie puts up on Twitter. This whole thing is just disgraceful and embarrassing."

opieandanthony,3dt4mj,CumiaVsBurr,5,Sun Jul 19 05:02:55 2015 UTC,I thought it was surprisingly good.  Lebron/Hader combo was funny. Movie only cost like 33 million to make and it made 30.5m in the first two days out. This film will be profitable by the end of today and then a total gravy train for the next 3 weeks in theatres. Thats CRAZY success for an R rated comedy these days. Get used to seeing a lot more Amy movies.
opieandanthony,3dt4mj,KnickedUp,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:46:02 2015 UTC,its not profitable yet. They do not include marketing budget in the movie budget. And they spent a ton on that.   edit: there is reason why when film make $200 million at the box office and it was made for $150 million... Its not consider a financial success because they drop $100 million on marketing.
opieandanthony,3dt4mj,Mtfilmguy,11,Sun Jul 19 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"85% on Rotten Tomatoes. You lose, sexists!   This is a film that belongs not to its director but to its star, who, if there is any justice in the world, is about to ascend from cult icon to mass phenomenon."

""If there's any justice in the world that piece of shit will die painfully"".  Amy has said some funny shit, on and off the air, but when she apologized for what was a funny fucking line she lost me. Business decision or no.

opieandanthony,3dt4mj,BoboOrban6,11,Sun Jul 19 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"People are talking about her like she is running for an election, like they want her to have some position in the culture. They did the same thing to Louis CK, they need him to represent something.  People get so defensive about female entertainers. They ask why people are making fun of the way she looks. I dunno, why have they been calling Jimmy a spineless worm for 20 years? Why have people been trashing Colin Quinn's awful legs or saying Kevin Hart is short? Why is nobody allowed to call Amy Schumer a frumpy bucktoothed four? All people do is call Bob Kelley fat.   Can't do it, cause women have it so rough. They'll turn around and say something like ""this is what women in entertainment need to deal with."" Yeah I guess so, cause you don't see Dave Attell stuffing himself into an Ed Hardy shirt so tight we can make out the exact contours of that zone of shame he calls an abdomen, but we need to give golf claps to all these unremarkable pillowcases full of ham that decide to wear their empowering ""take that, male gaze"" dresses."
opieandanthony,3dt4mj,TriangleDimes,4,Sun Jul 19 15:42:31 2015 UTC,You're right.  She should have fucked up her set-for-life money moment a week before the movie came out.

'Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her standup act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: ""And I mean BAD, like in that black way.""'"

opieandanthony,3dt4mj,ucfgavin,8,Sun Jul 19 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, it was okay, probably ""uneven"" is the best way to describe it.  There were a few weird scenes that fell flat, it didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be wacky or serious, etc.  Like CQ was great, but he mostly didn't get to actually be funny.  Lebron definitely did well ""for an athlete"", but not to the point where he deserved the knob-slobbering Opie gave when he talked about it on the show.  It's worth seeing, but yeah, you could wait to rent it."
opieandanthony,3dt4mj,c0rnballa,6,Sun Jul 19 05:53:24 2015 UTC,"it didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be wacky or serious   Every Apatow movie I've seen is like that. They all take the Titanic success model of combining chick flick with guy flick and apply it to comedies. Knocked up was a great example he directed. Funny half the time, then we have to wait out the 2+ hour running time that tries to make us care about whatever sappy dogshit happens with Seth Rogen.  It's all about that cash and crossing over demos."

Not my thing but it has it's audience.   My issue with all of this is that they're doing the same thing that they are basically forcing everyone to love Amy. They're doing their best to make her a new generation feminist icon and they're hyping her up like she's a female Carlin or Pryor. She's nothing like that. She's just the typical woman comic that can only talk about relationships and her vagina. She's fucking boring and the press is doing the same thing that they did to Louis CK's art-house wannabe show. Hyping it up as something brilliant when it's average at best. Now that the media has made her the new face of comedy expect those Emmy nods to pour in next year.  Truth is, and most that are hyping it up won't acknowledge it, but Amy falls back on all of the same women comic cliches as the rest of them. I personally don't have a problem with Amy being successful but I still don't get the hype. Is it the same phenomenon we saw with Lena Dunham where a 3 has the confidence of a 10 and talks about sex a bunch? It's boring and she brings nothing new but she has a gross body, a cabbage patch doll face, and she talks ""without fear"" about her sexuality. She's the perfect formula for tumblrinas in 2015 to idolize and everyone is eating it up."
opieandanthony,3dt4mj,CowsAreCurious,0,Sun Jul 19 16:46:16 2015 UTC,"Apatow directing = pass. His movies are too goddamn long. Comedy should max out at 100 minutes, tops, including end credits. Funny People and This is 40 were longer than Lawrence of Arabia. I've liked a lot of his producer efforts, though."

The guy is simply ignorant, old and he's finished, but he's not a bad guy and he's not a racist.  EDIT: Also, Ants ego is so big he much rather be called a racist than stupid.

Why is this a good thing to then add these people into the formula to make this a great country? Diversity for the sense of just diversity is not a good thing. And when I talk about race and try to be open and honest about it in this day and age, you’re chastised, you’re looked at as the racist."

opieandanthony,3due8s,KenFrezno,4,Sun Jul 19 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"He's not just wrong. It is one of the most idiotic things I've ever read.   The fact is there were quite a few black engineers etc. working for NASA (and it's various subcontractors) putting men on the moon in the late 50's / 60's.   Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell writes:   Take for example, Robert Shurney. A physicist from Tennessee State University, it was Dr. Shurney who designed the tires for the moon buggy used during the Apollo 15 mission in 1972. His ingenious design used wire mesh in the place of rubber to save weight yet still provide the needed flexibility.  Dr. Vance Marchbanks, a heart surgeon and medical specialist for NASA, helped develop ways to monitor astronauts' vital signs during space flight. It was Dr. Marchbanks who was responsible for John Glenn's health during America's first orbital flight.  George Carruthers, an astronautical engineer, built the camera that was carried to the moon on Apollo 16. He also designed and built a combination telescope and camera used on the shuttle missions. Some of the most enduring images from space were made us ing Dr. Carruthers' cameras.  Christine Darden, a mathematician and mechanical engineer, has been with NASA since 1966. Dr. Darden is a recognized leader in the reduction of shock waves from spacecraft wings and nose cones   There was even a black astronaut in the 60's:   In June 1967, Lawrence successfully completed the Air Force Flight Test Pilot Training School at Edwards AFB, California. That same month he was selected by the USAF as an astronaut in the Air Force's Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) program, thus becoming the first black astronaut.  Lawrence was killed on December 8, 1967, in the crash of an F-104 Starfighter at Edwards Air Force Base, California.   Not as many as today, but still. Why were there relatively few black people ""putting men on the moon"" in the 60's? Because of real fucking across-the-board-discrimination.   Stupid example: there are stories how the black engineers working for Grumman (who built the Lunar Module), when visiting Houston, were denied a room in the Grumman team's official hotel. You know, because the hotels were segregated.   The discrimination hurt the Apollo program. Many talented people never got the chance to contribute. The current Administrator of NASA, Charles Bolden (who is black) writes:   For me, it was an uphill battle. Because of my race, no one in my South Carolina congressional delegation would provide an appointment nor nomination to the Academy as was required for admission. I wrote President Lyndon B. Johnson asking for help, and that's when Congressman William Dawson of Illinois provided me the appointment I needed to be accepted.  Since then, I graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, flew more than 100 combat missions over Vietnam, earned a master's degree in systems management, flew on the space shuttle four times, and rose to the rank of major general in the U.S. Marine Corps.   Clearly, these are not people ""that do not pay attention to the laws of this country, do not assimilate to the cultures, do not work and contribute to this nation"". And it is not ""diversity for the sense of just diversity.""   Fucking insane."

opieandanthony,3due8s,mr__hat,2,Mon Jul 20 01:47:19 2015 UTC,You know. The latest NASA intuitive where they roll through the hood and scoop up blacks to meet a quota. They'd love to send a man to Mars but all their time is spent trying to teach Jerome how to do basic math. :(
opieandanthony,3due8s,MaskedUploader,3,Mon Jul 20 04:13:55 2015 UTC,"The Apollo program started in 1963. One year before the Civil Rights act. Yeah, screw those lazy blacks for not getting into the space program while not being allowed to drink from the same water fountains as whites!"
opieandanthony,3due8s,Muted_Post-Horn,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"That's not what Anthony is saying. He's not saying blacks weren't being in the space program because they are lazy. What he says is that society and NASA had a modus operandi that worked, and because they didn't spend time thinking about useless bullshit like diversity. To spend any time on wondering if there's enough dark skinned people or asians present is a waste of time. This is science, not some SJW fairy tale."
opieandanthony,3due8s,KenFrezno,2,Mon Jul 20 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"Right?  It's seemed pretty clear to me that he kept bringing up the space program example to push back against the idea that diversity is the highest of all virtues.  I never read it as 'see how much better things are when blacks aren't there to pollute them' or 'blacks would never be capable of contributing to something that complex or impressive.'  I mean, when he says 'we need to change this by injecting people that do not pay attention to the laws of this country, do not assimilate to the cultures, do not work and contribute to this nation'  obviously that's just a dumb strawman but his overall point that 'diversity for the sense of just diversity is not a good thing' is pretty defensible."
opieandanthony,3due8s,clearfield,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:49:16 2015 UTC,"we need to change this by injecting people that do not pay attention to the laws of this country, do not assimilate to the cultures, do not work and contribute to this nation   Except that this is precisely what is going on in the world right now. Look at affirmative action, or lowering the bar in black schools, where they reach the same credentials as other kids while being expected to preform much worse. It doesn't result in an equal playing field where they have the tools to compete with Asians, they get hired because of quotas, boss realizes they're useless, get fired, rayciss.   This is a waste of both of our times."
opieandanthony,3due8s,KenFrezno,2,Mon Jul 20 13:09:25 2015 UTC,He's wrong because blacks were employed at NASA and NACA in mathematical and engineering positions since the 50s. You can google it or crack a fucking book. Or you can disbelieve what I'm saying and go fuck yourself. It's wide open.
opieandanthony,3due8s,SIMBALLAH,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly, people who were qualified were working in the positions they were qualified well in. To mix this up with affirmative action and forced diversity does not result in better science. Science doesn't have time for your feelings."
opieandanthony,3due8s,KenFrezno,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:44 2015 UTC,He's wrong because the people he thinks are inferior to whites were already working there. He's wrong because the space program was a product of the efforts of a diverse group. The dumb fucking high school dropout is acting like that white control room is the entirety of NASA.   He also acts as if he'd have a place there just because he thinks he's perceived as white both currently and historically. That swarthy cocksucker would have been looked at the same way all Italians were in the early to mid 20th century. Spoiler alert: it's the same way right wing jerkoffs like him look at Mexicans today.
opieandanthony,3due8s,SIMBALLAH,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"The type of diversity Anthony was criticizing in that passage was the type of diversity SJWs go for; The picture where you see the men at the control HQ, you won't see a team like that today because SJW culture will start thinking about who's represented and who's not, when in actuality every sector is working as it's supposed to.   If Indians and Eskimos turn out to be excellent rocket engineers or theoretical mathematicians, by all means, hire them. But don't waste my time with invading science with your insecurities. There's no reason to introduce diversity into science for the sake of diversity."
opieandanthony,3due8s,KenFrezno,2,Mon Jul 20 13:12:26 2015 UTC,Anthony was saying that it was only white men at NASA based solely on the control room photo. He is completely fucking wrong. If you want to divert this into a hiring standards debate go for it. Somebody else can argue with you.
opieandanthony,3due8s,SIMBALLAH,0,Mon Jul 20 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"So it would be wrong to say: ""The mission control room in 1950s was full of white people"", because there were a few blacks present too? You are starting to think the way these social justice warriors think."

It's hard for me to believe that a space program would have been even better with diversity, as advocates of diversity claim. It would have been the same, I think.  In other words, a team that is all white is inherently worse than a team that is a mix of races and ethnicities, all other things being equal. I don't think that's true in general."
opieandanthony,3due8s,Spokker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:37 2015 UTC,Its because segregation existed in the 50s and black people weren't allowed better schooling or jobs. In Anthony's mind its because they were too busy soft shoeing to work for NASA.

Bonus points if they don't have black people there.   Anthony loves pissing off people, so that's what I'd do, but from the safety of a country with low prices and few laws. I'd get zooted, go into full blackface and fuck inappropriately young ladyboys on camera. While recovering in between each fuck session, I'd read aloud ""The International Jew"" and ramble about why America is doomed. Then I'd post it all online and watch the outrage shekels come rolling in.   Next week, I'd outfit a dog in an orange prison jumpsuit and behead it on camera while doing Dicis and screaming Allahu Akbar. Then I'd have my Asian chef cook the dog so I could eat it. I'm basically out of ideas now, but I'm sure I could come up with more if I was Ant."

I guess they're the forbidden fruit, whereas you can literally go buy a nip girl for a couple thousand... which is a pretty fucking good deal, all things considered. Anthony the racist is screwing over Anthony the pervert."

opieandanthony,3dtxz2,juicypekka,5,Sun Jul 19 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"Russian girls are notorious for being dead inside and having terrible attitudes, and Anthony is intimidated by that because he's a smart man. ""Back home I am licensed psychiatrist. In America, I heff to fack Autistic Arab HVAC radio man."" He can't own one of those, and once the green card is in, she'll trade her Anthony for a Vlad or Jamarcus. But in some pedo paradise, Ant can trade a ten-year-old for a block of salt and he won't even have to groom her because she's already in a culture that values obedience, plus she's happy that she can return to her village once her pubes start growing.   But instead, he's buying gifts for little whores on Twitter? His racism is really fucking him over here."

He has said before how much he was freaking out when he got fired realizing that if he did not get something up on his own quickly he would be irrelevent just as quick.    WHile he does not have any kids he did have to shell out $2M to his ex, he is in a high tax bracket in Long Island and that compound has $20-$30k in taxes alone every year.  While I would guess the money he is making from TACS (I am guessing undr $1M/Year) if that dried up I think he would have financial issues within a year based on how he lives."

He's spoken endlessly about investing, seems to know how to go about doing it, and also talked about ""special"" safety deposit boxes.   I get it, you all want him to fail, because of this irrational hatred you have for him. Just like how he's an alcoholic, because you want him to be one.   Anthony will be fine. He'll have a better retirement than you can ever hope for. He may have to get rid of the big house later on, and move into a retirement community, but he'll pay his bills with no problems.

The money he paid to his ex-wife was only a big deal because, well, he had to give it to his ex-wife. ""Seven-figures,"" but I doubt it was substantial enough in the long run to drastically alter his lifestyle.  No kids, no expenses, basically lives like a college student.

opieandanthony,3dtxz2,MSteve1232000,0,Sun Jul 19 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"Oh I absolutely agree. Comedians, too. Norm MacDonald's blown his entire fortune gambling more than once. It's definitely not unheard of.  I think, this is just a theory, Ant's craziness was more under control when he had an actual job he needed to show up to every day, specifically during the '05-'11 era of O&A. Him being a bit of a degenerate with his gambling/young girls/alcoholism was sort of a tongue-in-cheek running gag that was semi-true, but for all the talk of him being a loose cannon, he generally showed up for work, reeled in his eating/drinking habits after his ""scare,"" paid his alimony despite not wanting to. I think all his ""white respectability"" talk comes from him being proud of himself for being a functioning adult for a few years.  In terms of wildly irresponsible spending that could actually bankrupt him, I'd point more towards his several-thousand-dollar a month NYC studio than his partying. Ant is building up a bigger and bigger nut he has to crack every month with all this investing in his ""podcasting network,"" as opposed to gambling/drinking which is just one-off money blowing, even if it happens a lot.  I think he probably built himself a little nest back in '05-'11, that he will proceed to now blow."

opieandanthony,3dtchp,xxmikekxx,6,Mon Jul 20 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"Here is the reasons I can think of  1-it's his talent level. You ever know someone who you only talk about the same topics with? you just can't connect on anything else even if you want to? You just can't think of anything. That is basically Anthony's relationship as a solo host to an audience. I think he doesn't have the ability to come up with other topics. On O&A, he would be hilarious chiming in on topics that others brought up. But he has no one else to bring up anything & he can't think of anything   2-he thinks that because no one else in the media does it, that could be his ticket in. He'll get all the disenfranchised people who are frustrated that no one is being honest about black people. The problem is, even people who do hate black people, why would they need to listen to another guy talk about it? & how can they find out about Anthony behind a pay wall  3-he's a very angry man & hes just blinded & illogical from his ongoing rage spiral. So it doesn't make sense, he's just projecting the shitty things in his life on people who's ancestors were from Africa"

A transparent, predictably awful, time-filler. Now Anthony plays the same tune. Hell, anyone can find a news story about blacks commiting crime and yell about it. Oh wait, is this comedic talent pulling out the gook glasses again? Another video about defense gun use? I never thought I'd call Anthony a hack.   I had really high hopes for Anthony's show, even got a 6 month sub in the beginning. I should have seen this coming."

Worse, I think he believes it's his ticket to relevancy. I remember reading a comment where someone mentioned that Ant thinks he can become some kind of gavin/coulter hybrid that attracts attention by being controversial. He does get more retweets for racist stuff, so he's probably convinced it's the path to take.  And of course the fact that he has PTSD when it comes to anyone taking his money, due to 9 years of paying alimony. Once he entered into a higher tax bracket he started taking out his anger on blacks since they were ""mooching"" off his wealth. Or so his internal narrative says.  There's probably also some daddy issues mixed in there, with his dad being a ""screaming racist"" who liked guns.  Who knows for sure, but it doesn't look like he's going to have a moment of clarity any time soon. He'll continue to stave us off with the occasional ""We're definitely looking to bring the funny. Race stuff is fun, but I'm not going to dwell on it anymore."" tweets."

He knows how transparent and vein Opie is and understands that if he words his compliment the right way Opie is going to jump at the chance to say ""thanks."" Even the people who like Opie play him like a fiddle because he is so, so, so dumb and easy to work. Opie is so attention hungry that his own fans can recognize that he responds to the lowest of the low in order to share almost any compliment he receives.

opieandanthony,3dp8pf,panjshirlion,4,Sat Jul 18 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"""Barbaroi"" was originally applied to anyone who didn't speak Greek (later Latin).

Upper Cumia and lower Cumia are still locations near Messina - far from extinct:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=catP4keLfrw  According to the Italian wikipedia the etymology could very well be Greek.   I am 100% Southern Italian (not Sicilian) - need I remind you people that North Africans are not Moolies nor is our skin dark because of ""invasions"".   We have dark skin and hair because our ancestors came from a rural/agricultural community coupled with a hot climate. If anyone is interested my genetic history is probably made up of Greek, French-Norman (aka Viking), Roman and maybe Jew.   That is mostly speculation we are talking about ancestors from 1000+ years ago. I can trace my family tree back 500 years to an ancestor from Rome no further than that.   P.S my cousins who are all 100% southern Italian have blonde hair and blue eyes + I have a reddish beard and my hair is jet black. Maybe I got more Jew/Greek in me - who knows?

opieandanthony,3dp8pf,panjshirlion,3,Sat Jul 18 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is how populations originally evolved, hence black people along the equator, paler people further from it. But that type of evolution occurs over a much greater time span than recorded human history. If some Norwegians set up shop in a hot climate, they're not going to miraculously become brown (browner than a tan, at least) or black on any historical timescale without interbreeding. 1000 years is a long time, but not nearly long enough for purely Greek or Norman stock to ""evolve"" into something else without intermarriage with other ethnicities.  I'm not trying to shit on you at all. I only think it's funny to call Ant a Berber because he'd obviously hate it. But it is silly to imagine that historical migration and a 300-year Arab-Berber occupation has nothing to do with the ethnic makeup of modern Italy and Sicily.  EDIT: Unless you're referring to the original ""Sikels"" whom the Greeks conquered, whatever they were. I suppose they could have evolved to be darker-skinned, but I can't imagine there's much native Sikel blood left after so many foreign overlays."

If someone here is a photoshop/art wizard I would love seeing the beard hair replaced with Cumia's and I bet its eerie how close they look!  Anthony does definitely look like some kind of Arab. He's barely white (as he has said) and its also possible his father was some kind of arab who just told people he was italian i suppose. that wasn't unusual when I was growing up. I remember some guys named 'Moe' who were 'Italians' but were actually 'Mohammads' and from Lebanon. but who the hell knows the difference - we didn't.

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,Genericscreen,16,Sat Jul 18 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"It kind of seems like he got it all out with his tear-filled reaction 4 months ago. Erock had a great point that day when he said if he had just shown up on Ant's show early on, this/the bitterness would have been avoided. But he was probably being pissed at the time about Anthony blowing up the show  I do think Opie was trying to get the O&A ""brand"" back together in some form before Anthony torpedoed that earlier this year (with the best-ofs). He might have been talking to Greenstein about getting it to work again"
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,airforce20,27,Sat Jul 18 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of when O&A, Opie especially, would take shot after shot at Stern and Stern very rarely acknowledged them. In fact, he only ever acknowledged them on-air a few times. Opie is now doing the same thing to Ant and I'm not sure if that says more about Ant or more about Opie. Ant is now the little dog begging for attention from the bigger dog and the bigger dog is just ignoring him as he should."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,burner989,16,Sat Jul 18 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah although Stern used to freak out a little during the WNEW days. I remember a few years ago Howard tried to start a radio war with some other guy, the guy didn't want trouble, and Howard was almost complimentary saying ""No one argues anymore. You know, Opie and Anthony, they would go after me."" It was so random and wistful considering he normally acts like they're nothing"
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,airforce20,36,Sat Jul 18 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I swear, I've listened to most of the shows (both TACS and O&J) and its kind of one-sided, no? Opie really hasn't taken any real shots at Anthony at all. The harshest he was when talking about how they're not going to go out to Long Island and step over drunk girls, and in the post Ant-trashing him show he implied he has alcohol issues. Otherwise he's actually defended him a bunch, even with the racist shit.  Ant on the other hand has been a bit harsher.  Opie doesn't have the vindictive wit that would let him make fun of Ant in any hurtful way. He kind of seems to not care that much (which I think drives Ant insane, hence the ""i built it"" twitter line and jabs like that).  ETA Also he even still tells fun stories about when they hung out and seems to legit feel nostalgic, while all of the stories Ant tells are with an eye roll and a ""ugh"" feel."

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,sanfrancisco69er,26,Sat Jul 18 19:03:59 2015 UTC,Ant has been ridiculously harsh he got sucked into the reddit hate fest like most of us do and took/still takes shots at the guy who made his career. Classy.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,That70smoke,20,Sun Jul 19 06:14:17 2015 UTC,"he got sucked into the reddit hate fest like most of us do   Unlike the rest of us, he seems to lack perspective and thinks the mindset on Reddit is shared by everyone he encounters in real life. He made a ""black friends"" joke about DeRosa at the roast. How many people outside of Reddit even paid attention to that excuse, let alone remember it a year later? He's just been holed up in his echo-chamber mansion on Long Island for the past year, taking shots at his former business partner, black people and anyone who disagrees with him, completely oblivious to the fact that the rest of the world has moved on from the tiny blip on the radar that was his firing and the subsequent drama."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,olloop,3,Sat Jul 18 18:47:10 2015 UTC,echo-chamber   Gas chamber you mean
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,LyleChipperson1,8,Sat Jul 18 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"From a business context it doesn't make sense for Opie to do anything other than pretend Ant never existed, and that's the only context Opie cares about.  He's making the money he wants now while exerting no effort, and bringing up Ant will only serve to remind people of how much better they liked OnA, while at the same time getting him into pathetic online food fights that will simply serve to embarrass him due to his lack of wit and tendency to argue like a teenage girl on a Myspace page.  He's like if Skynet ran Windows 95; he's self-aware of how dim he is, and doesn't want a continued fight with Ant to shine a light on that fact."

Also when Ant first was fired and guests would come in and ask how Ant was doing Opie would say ""he's doin some show from his basement"" and then Jimmy would go on to explain that Ant actually has a sound studio in his basement with a green screen and shit...  Opie did take some passive aggressive jabs like that but Anthony certainly went over the top."

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,wifflebb,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"When Larry King was in studio and asked what Ant is doing Opie said ""he's doing a show, uhh, from his house.""  And then Jimmy chimed in and said ""He has a whole studio set up and everything"" and then Opie started talking about it being good but I guarantee you he also told other guests he is doing a show from his basement."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,kgt5003,2,Sun Jul 19 03:28:57 2015 UTC,You just gave an example of one time this didn't happen.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,wifflebb,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:29:16 2015 UTC,"No shit.. that wasn't an example of Opie saying Anthony works from his basement that was just one time I know for sure Opie mentioned Anthony's podcast on the show and did so in a way to make it sound like it's not really a professional show until Jimmy explained it.  When Opie did his rebuttal to Ant's ""walking on greggshells"" broadcast Jimmy's complaint to Opie about the way the show has been going is that he felt like Opie doesn't mention Ant's show enough in a positive way.  He then also included himself and said from day one they should have been promoting Anthony's show every day and they really didn't do that.  Most of the time Opie didn't mention Anthony's show at all.  If a guest did ask what Ant was doing he would refer to his show in a way to make it seem like he's doing something that anybody with a microphone could do.  Jimmy would always talk up Ant's situation to make it sound like it's much better than it was (""he's making more money now than he was before"" ""his studio is more impressive than the one we have here"") and Opie would always downplay what Ant was doing by calling it a ""show from his house"" or ""internet show"" or ""show from his basement"" and would only say positive shit after Jimmy stepped in.  You don't have to be very perceptive to understand what Opie was doing when he would say that shit.  I'm really not going to torture myself digging up clips of garbage to prove this point.  It isn't important enough."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,kgt5003,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:28 2015 UTC,Think you might be spending a little too much time thinking about all this.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,wifflebb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:58:46 2015 UTC,I spent two seconds thinking about it after reading a post about it.  Isn't that what discussion boards are?  Somebody posts a question or a comment and then you think about it for two seconds and respond?  I dunno how your memory works but it isn't exactly splitting the atom to recall/interpret things that have been said on a radio show.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,kgt5003,13,Sun Jul 19 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"yeah the human garbage line was pretty bad, but I think it was Opie straight up being pissy-eyed that his former friend/business partner just spent 2 hours trashing him.  And making it immediately one of the free shows on his youtube. Jeez that really seems even harsher in retrospect.  Ant kind of had a ""I'm a liberated WOMAN and PROUD!"" attitude during that entire debacle"
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,johnnymcjonny,3,Sun Jul 19 13:59:47 2015 UTC,Human Garbage was opie's one good shot at athony. Wasn't a bad line at all. He's just a pussy for deleting it.

And I remember Opie telling people about the studio Ant had built. And that he'd been wanting to do his own thing. Etc.   I never heard him say 'he's doing some show from his basement.'

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,stinkskc,-9,Sun Jul 19 03:39:19 2015 UTC,"he called hiim human garbage on twitter after ""not watching"" his tell all show. He made jabs like 50.000 new listeners. He sort of pretended that it was Opie's show all along and Anthony was just a bit player,when it was a partnership.   Ant feels betrayed and probably knows a lot more of what happened behind the scenes than he lets on,probably for reasons of""pending litigation."" There's no way he could be fired that fast from a company where he wasn't technically an employee. I wish he would  have expressed that in his greggshells show instead of bringing up ghost from the past and other immature shit."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,anonimescu,7,Sat Jul 18 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"was it really a partnership? patrice, bill, jim, pretty much everyone acted like Opie was the boss. Sam used to make jokes on Nopie shows about how erock acted like a badass because ""Daddy's gone"""
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,airforce20,17,Sat Jul 18 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Prediction:   Jimmy will briefly bring up the roast & the pounding Ant is getting on Monday because he feels obligated to defend him. If anything, Opie will say it happens to even pros and he heard it wasn't even that bad.  My impression is that he still feels Ant is kinda like family. I believe most people here have read Opie completely wrong."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,mr__hat,9,Sat Jul 18 20:38:41 2015 UTC,They didn't even mention the bombing or the roast on Thursday's show. Why would you think they would talk about it Monday? I'm not sure if you've even noticed but none of the even say his name anymore on the show. He never existed.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,ShadowbannedKeith,10,Sat Jul 18 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Brother Joe (sigh) brought that up when he said Anthony talked about business while Opie thought it was personal (with the irony is that it looks like Opie was running all the business stuff). I think Opie does like Anthony but, to Anthony, Opie was kind of just a way for him to get out of air conditioning. That's probably  why things like the FH Rileys incident made Opie flip the fuck out in a ""wtf bro?"" way"
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,airforce20,15,Sat Jul 18 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"You know, I keep hearing people say Opie won't fire back because he isn't clever enough to do so. How clever do you need to be to trash Cumia at this point. Anthony's life would write Opie's material for him."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,AnudderCast,16,Sat Jul 18 18:41:25 2015 UTC,I think Opie is just smarter when it comes to this. He realizes that he wins by just doing nothing. I think he knew from day 1 that Ant would self destruct with enough time.   I also think Opie feels pity for what Ant has become and is just embarrassed for him.
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,MadDog1981,0,Sat Jul 18 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"""Racist"" and ""Pedophile"" aren't really hard-hitting insults in the O&A world...at least they never used to be."

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,TheWetMuffinV2,16,Sat Jul 18 19:42:32 2015 UTC,"The heat is off Opie. Opie has a successful lame show where he is interviewing A list celebrities here and there.   Ant's following is turning on him at a steady pace.   Opie is above it. Mentioning Ant has absolutely no plus side. Ant is a dying fly in the wind at this point.   First they came for Derosa.  Then they came for Opie.  And at the finale of this saga, they came for their false idol, Anthony Cumia."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,Heifsin85,11,Sat Jul 18 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"All his shots were taken at point blank face to face, while they were still employed together. Opie has done nothing but promote Anthony since his firing any time he's mentioned, and allow others to promote Anthony on his show. Legitimate promotion, not the old gag where he pretends to not know the twitter/website name and fucks it up on purpose."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,wrexecute,2,Sat Jul 18 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Not to reply to myself, but fuck edits, I don't believe in it.. I can actually only think of one standout moment where Opie went after Ant, and it was all over the way Ant was acting like an entitled asshole about a tab at FH Rileys."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,wrexecute,5,Sat Jul 18 19:49:44 2015 UTC,yeah that argument (which I guess some of the paltalk people could see) would be interesting to hear.   either way i think Ant fucked up with that one. it'd be like Opie going on twitter bashing Brother Joe's u2 band or something because they didnt let him backstage
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,johnnymcjonny,10,Sat Jul 18 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think he wants to. His Twitter is all retweeting compliments these days. He wants the show to be positive & light & friendly. That's the true ""new direction"" of the show he is trying for."

opieandanthony,3dr9kg,GypsyDishwasher,10,Sun Jul 19 03:27:27 2015 UTC,I think the hate he's getting is that he just keeps harping on it like a 14yr old girl that got broken up with.  It's just sad and he needs to stop being such douche

Opie does not want a repeat of his crying like a jag-off on air. Anthony is the only person, outside of his mother and maybe his brothers, who can make him fall apart and go full retard and tears.   If there's one constant for Opie, it's that he's a pussy coward. The last time Opie thought he was a man with something to say, Ant reduced him to a blubbering puddle of pissbaby."
opieandanthony,3dr9kg,panjshirlion,-11,Sat Jul 18 20:41:54 2015 UTC,Opie never really took direct shots.   But saying that he fought for anthony and anthony was ready to do his own thing. Spewing bullshit lies to a mostly captive audience. That type of shit is even worse than shots.

opieandanthony,3drv82,WildHog69,49,Sat Jul 18 21:22:12 2015 UTC,There was no incident.  After Ant got fired Burr called him to talk about it twice and Ant didn't answer the phone or return the calls and that was it.  On Ant's show like half a year ago he said he was nervous to call Burr but he was definitely going to return the calls finally but then he pussied out and never called and that was that.  Burr never talked any shit about Ant and Ant never talked any shit about Burr.  Some retard Ant fans and Joe Cumia started giving Burr shit because he didnt go on a national campaign to get Ant his job back.  Apparently Burr was supposed to drop his own career and begin managing Ant's after he was fired.
opieandanthony,3drv82,kgt5003,13,Sat Jul 18 21:47:35 2015 UTC,People on here were legitimately pissed at Burr and it was absolutely ridiculous. Some faggot even said he was just as bad as DeRosa. I wanted to put my fist through my monitor.

opieandanthony,3drv82,Torinn88,4,Sun Jul 19 10:44:15 2015 UTC,"Burr was talking about how when they walk out of the building they all just kinda don't talk to or look at each other because they are walking out of a studio where they just said and did horrible things.  He was making a joke about how they are all ashamed of themselves after the shit they do when they get on the radio and then when they step outside and the sunlight hits them and they reflect upon the fact that they just had a homeless lady crawling around naked on mouse traps to get tickets to a concert or whatever debauchery took place they can't even look at each other.  That is the thing I remember Burr talking about, unless you are remembering a different occasion."

opieandanthony,3drv82,Viking_Lordbeast,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"Ant genuinely likes bill and didn't want people shitting on him like they were DeRosa and anyone else who didn't tweet support, because that's what people were doing.    Ant has made himself look like a huge pussy many other times because he doesn't like conflict.  Bill had no reason to call ant, especially since he's married to a militant black woman.  ""Hey Nia, I'm gonna call ant and show my support because he just called your race animals.  Is that cool?""    Sorry, you're wrong."

Bill Burr calls anthony TWICE after he gets fired for calling black people animals, while Bill is married to a black woman and has argued with ant in the past about race.  OR, ant lied about Bill calling him and didn't call him back because he's 'scared.'    Give me a reason why bill would call ant?"
opieandanthony,3drv82,kevin121312,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:53:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe just to check in on him and find out what happened firsthand, rather than from other people or the press.  ""Hey, I heard about your firing. How are you doing? What the fuck happened?""   That seems like a phone call you'd make if someone that you worked with for years had been fired. And an opportunity to talk with him one on one about the racist shit and call him on it personally (which is probably the thing he's afraid of).  And maybe he hasn't talked about it publicly because he hasn't been able to talk to Anthony personally (and we saw what happened when DeRosa didn't).   Of course, Anthony could be lying just because we don't know any of these people or their actions personally. But I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility for him to call, and it makes more sense than Ant just lying about it for months."

opieandanthony,3dr5vf,TheDarkFezRises,17,Sat Jul 18 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"hate to pile on the guy but DeRosa  Just because I heard him on the show and thought he was pretty great on the show 2011-2012ish and then I heard his stand-up...  I'm not a huge fan of the destruction of DeRosa by people fucking up his amazon ratings, etc. but he really does owe a lot of his career to Opie and Anthony, unlike Burr and CK, Vos and even Norton. He didn't even have a wikipedia page during his first year or so on the show.   also I still think its fucked up he threw Ant under the bus just because it was clear he was always helping DeRosa a little on the show while Opie seemed to not really get the pop culture references and stuff"
opieandanthony,3dr5vf,johnnymcjonny,6,Sat Jul 18 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah opie was never into derosa. Anthony and jimmy were the guys supporting him. But the really sad part is that anthony considered derosa a good friend, i dont think danny ross bff category but someone he would consider a friend outside of the show.  Its been a hard few years for ant, and his attitude after losing danny and derosa of just ignoring it or letting it slide must be really bad for his mind"
opieandanthony,3dr5vf,xactraiserx,6,Sat Jul 18 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"For sure. Ant tells stories of him and Derosa going out and getting bombed.   But who really put everything together for Joe was Billy. He brought him on board with everything Bill did. Had him open for him forever. He opened for Bill at fucking Carnegie Hall.   And Bill's wife is black. I think that might of had something to do with it. I understand it a little bit. Your best friend, your mentor who you see constantly has a black wife. So it might be tough to defend Anthony who is a known racist, but the racism was projected on national media.   I don't think he should of thrown him under the bus like he did. I would have kept my mouth shut and pulled a Burr. Just stayed out of it."

The other day I watched the VideOandA clip where they took apart a terrible comic on an old '80s TV show and it was hilarious. Imagine if he did that to himself, and even got Jimmy, Vos or whoever to take part, they could have played it back on his show and played some of the old audio drops and it would have been hilarious.  But, he has become so insecure and sensitive to any criticism that he refuses to even admit that he bombed, let alone have fun with it. Plus, if he laughed about it, then everyone else would be able to. There wouldn't have to be these forced Twitter responses and phone calls from Luis J. Gomez and Jimmy. They don't want to have to placate this old man, Luis and Soder jump on people in an instant when they bomb on YKWD - but they have to tell Ant that he didn't to appease him. They must hate that.  Even more frustrating is that, after so many years with Jim, he hasn't learned the value of self-deprecation. How many times did Jimmy turn a joke around and get a laugh after bombing by acknowledging that it didn't work? Even callers would get a laugh when they said ""...oh no, I'm panicking - punching out.""   If he just initially admitted that he bombed on his show, then all of the criticism and mockery on here would probably stop. But now, even if he admitted it, it wouldn't matter. We've all seen how phony and overly sensitive he's become, and how the people he's surrounded himself with will tell him anything."

opieandanthony,3doxkz,uhgnk,5,Sat Jul 18 07:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's just bizarre that after hearing 17 1/2 years of jokes and comedy from Anthony the last 2 1/2 years have been a bizarrely zoned in racial commentary and 6.99 pay per view self destruction.   There are thousands of hours of tape featuring Opie and Anthony before the comedians came on and they're unanimously awful.  95% of it is hacky 90s attitide. Despite every second being old and dated Anthony is still funny.  Listen to old episodes and hear how unfunny and corny everything is... but Anthony is still funny. Opie sucked then and sucks now but for 17 years Anthony gave them fucking magic out there.   The right field racist heel turn is so weird and misguided I can't believe it's happening.  He went on a white nationalism show and played stupid. Getting away with that is a once in a lifetime gift. Lucky Anth, right?  8 months later he actually said ""Black people don't think"" and expected to get congratulated by his peers and audience.   Big Jay and L.O.S. have one of the most liberal, pro comedy, pro speech audiences in America, if not  all of comedy. The mutants who have followed around LOS are some free thinking, hard to offend individuals.  Not only is the crowd thirsty for dirty jokes, the panel of roasters is made up of the BLUEST COMEDIANS in NYC. You can literally joke about anything in front of the audience and comedians and theyre going to be cool. Other acts made racial jokes and they weren't looked at like bridge goblins eating Africans alive. They made jokes that came off like jokes...Anthony sounds like your racist father.   The audience no sold Anthonys jokes because they were weird and racist and outdated and he treated the crowd like they were fans of his show and not Big Jay and LOS. These are people who laughed at Soders sister being dead but didn't smile when Anthony was doing his inside baseball racist bullshit. It's fucking telling.   Besides the horrible white power fans he's accumulated over the past year Anthony was in front of a crowd of comedy fans and an audience that would laugh at the worst shit imaginable if it was funny. He bombed."

opieandanthony,3dosbk,RearNakedGrope,11,Sat Jul 18 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"You might be onto something; IMO there is potentially strong evidence that Jordan Sargent either knowingly uses baseless allegations or makes them up himself:    Late last night when I read the article, which was very well documented (via the SMS exchange between the hooker and the gentleman Gawker outed) to support many of the hooker's allegations, I found it VERY curious that there was absolutely no documentation to support the allegation that the man Gawker outed offered to ""trade favors to kill the story.""    Considering that allegation (and that allegation alone) is what provided the editors at Gawker the justification to publish the story, it raises serious concerns about Jordan Sargent.  Might this be another Stephen Glass situation?"

There were a few comments on that story that were basically ""oh yeah, I'm a comedian and I've heard those stories about Louie before"" and they would invariably be responded to by Sargent saying ""can you email me?"" over and over again."

You noticed they acted indignant and refused to post any of the pictures from the hacked phones of female celebs and wrote dozens of stories about how its harassment. Gawker is a lot bigger then that one website they also control that pop feminist site Jezebel and that social justice gaming website Kotaku.

opieandanthony,3dosbk,Holzmann,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:43 2015 UTC,I don't buy that.  And I don't know the answer to this but my gut feeling is if this were say that dummy Todd Palin this would have not been met with any sort of outrage from all sides as this was.  Now in that case they would have played the hypocrisy card because of their views on gay marriage so you see it's MUCH different!!! So I don't believe it's swinging back the other way -- it's just a protected ruling class person who was outed in this case.

The dude is, if not a semi-public figure, an extremely high-profile private one, and what he was doing was probably illegal.  Why is it on Gawker to keep this dude's secret/keep up his facade?  Also, Geithner is in the publishing game, which, in theory, places some kind of emphasis on honesty/integrity/transparency.  I think this is much more on Geithner's sleaziness and lack of discretion than Gawker's.  I'm not for witch-hunting or outing gays, but if you head down Sleazy Avenue and (try to) lay down with the wrong guy/gal, and get caught (up in something) along the way, well, dem's the breaks.  I think trying to crucify Gawker for this is sinking to their level.  Why is reporting that a married dude tried to pay a gay escort for sex more shameful/unethical than a married dude actually trying to pay a gay escort for sex?  I don't understand that.  If you have kids, maybe put your gay escort sexing days behind you (tss).  Why is reporting/commenting on the act worse than the act itself?  Who's worse: that urban teen who stole those girls' lemonade stand money, or someone who calls that piece of shit a ""nigger""?"
opieandanthony,3drj3x,thecrikey,12,Sat Jul 18 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"I think it basically just comes down to the fact that Opie was trying to handle a real issue between them like a normal human being, and Anthony calculates every moment in his life to pander to anonymous people on the internet.  Anthony has stated that he doesn't love anyone. I'm sure that translates into being completely detached from any real feelings about anything. To him....everything is radio. Everything is for the 'show'.   The Greggshells episode was the defining moment of that."

opieandanthony,3drj3x,Eternalforms,0,Sun Jul 19 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"He cares about himself. That's why he's a pissy eyed faggot. He cries when he doesn't get his way. He doesn't care whatsoever about any other people in his life. Sure, he's generous with his stuff when people come over, but that's cause he's extremely wealthy and doesn't think it's ever going to run out. He doesn't think love exists. He treats women like absolute garbage and he has zero empathy with people in the situation he was in before getting EXTREMELY lucky with a mediocre, racist parody song. He's a funny fuck and I'm glad it happened for him, but he doesn't seem to have a conscience and if it wasn't for his success he'd be a crack addict criminal leech now. His father was the only person in his life to be honest with him"
opieandanthony,3drj3x,SAHandre,3,Sun Jul 19 07:13:59 2015 UTC,"You're right about Ant, but lets be honest they're both like that. Can we even count how many times Opie brought personal and work related conflicts to the show because he knew he would have the upper hand on-air? He tried for years to paint the image of him being this tough guy bully that told management what to do, not the other way around. He could do that because he knew 9 times out of 10 his bosses wouldnt come on the air and confront him. Because loudly declaring every day on the radio that you have no respect for your bosses and nicknaming them babysitters is how normal people deal with issues. I wonder how great it must have been for Gary and the others when they heard about how quickly Opie shut his mouth and fell in line after Ant's firing."

It wasnt as bad as everyone says but the room speaks for itself: you could hear a pin drop. I found myself cringing at many ""punchlines"". That locks of douche line: a) he fumbled it. Should have let it go there. B) i dont get it. Its not a pun, doesnt sound like the charity's name, nor a callback or inside joke relating to any previous subject. Im having problems classifying it as a ""joke"". You can definetly call it words strung together to form a sentence i guess.  I dont know if im the only one, but i just cant see Ant going to a quiet room with a pen and notebook for hours on end writing jokes. Its just not his strong suit. Hes best when riffing with the mics on, off the cuff with 2 or 3 others to bounce off of. The ones who did really well (Metzger, Vecchione) are joke writing machines and unless its a big roast with writers like Metzger or Vechiond writing for everyone else those guys are going to be the ones who shine. Guys like Vos and Big Jay who are known not to write anything still manage to excell because they have decades of experience."
opieandanthony,3dsauo,RahnBayngtin,3,Sun Jul 19 00:11:55 2015 UTC,He should have hired someone to write the jokes.
opieandanthony,3dsauo,kgt5003,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:18:29 2015 UTC,"Not only did Ant butcher his ""locks of douche"" joke but earlier in the roast Vecchione had a hilarious joke where he used ""locks of hate"" as his fake charity.  It was a far superior joke built off the same sort of premise so if Ant was actually paying attention instead of still pecking away at his phone (fine-tuning his material) he would have known to drop that joke from his set."
opieandanthony,3dsauo,RahnBayngtin,3,Sun Jul 19 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"I have a new found respect for Vecchione after that roast. Always heard about him and never really heard him besides a YKWD appearance, just thought of him as Dan Soder's less funny roomate but man that guy killed and had a fuck ton of material. Hes a funny fucker"

opieandanthony,3dsauo,axeheadroad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:27:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, still not that funny."

The image of Ari Shaffir and Big Jay shaving their shitty hair so that little cancer kids can sew it together into a wig so that Anthony can wear the wig is hilarious.  It makes fun of Anthony being a hateful old fucker, Big Jay and Ari having terrible hair (prior to both of them cutting their hair down) and Anthony having terrible fake hair."

You can very clearly hear the crowd dying laughing at the guys before Ant and then when Ant is up there on some of the jokes you could hear a pin drop.  Ant is trying to say that the crowd was going nuts for his jokes and they just didn't have a microphone on them properly so that's why you couldn't tell they were laughing at his set.  It's complete bullshit.

Most of the time they gave a polite chuckle.  Even if you want to argue he didn't bomb, his jokes were paint-by-numbers and terrible.  Goes to show there is a difference between being quick-witted and a joke writer."

Then there are other fanboys who deny it and say facts can't be racist. I don't get that argument. But it always reminds me of liberals who didn't want to be called liberals anymore. Their explanation for the change had to do with how leftist policies had evolved, and that progressive was a ""different thing"". Horseshit. They got tired of people saying the word contemptibly, and tried to take away the ability to hurt their little faggy thin-skinned feelings. Similar to what secretaries and stewardesses did, as there's nothing inherently wrong or insulting with either of those words. These are all just cases of crybabies who want reality to change just because it would make them feel better, and changing names is the closest they can get.

While I can agree that the arguments are often valid, or at least worth a fair discussion rather than jumping to intolerance of the intolerant and shutting it down without a second thought, it climbs to a different level when it becomes obsession with the topic. I mean how can you let it bother you so much that you spend half your time thinking about it? Is it really such a massive epidemic that's it's worth that much effort? In my opinion people like that aren't pushing to see a problem solved, they just like screaming about it because it makes them feel better to scream about something that involves people. It makes them feel better about themselves to vilify. That obsession is the tipoff that it's disingenuous and is, in the end, shittiness just for shittiness's sake."

I think that's where a lot of his masked pity comes from in regards to his fanbase that these people will hang onto his every word, even through he's made the exact same point numerous times.   Look how some of his fans are quick to bring uphow it's ""ok"" that he's attracted to young girls because it's in a man's ""biology"" or whatever horse shit, quack hypothesis they try to string together. It's borderline cult like how they justify everything he does. They idolize his firing like it was some grave injustice on society, when probably 95% of society was going ""Who?"".

Gun arsenal, needlessly expensive cars, $50,000 hands of blackjack, massive alcoholism, plenty of mooching hangers on and family, buying a house for $1 million over its worth, heating a pool to 80 degrees F and keeping all the lights on in a giant, ugly house.

opieandanthony,3dn3tr,MeteorBlitzkieg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:38 2015 UTC,"I do tend to think he has a lot of money saved up. I know everyone likes to believe that he's a crazy drunk pissing it away, but I don't know. He doesn't have family or kids. It's not like he's buying private jets or anything. He has a very nice house & a pool he can't shut the fuck up about. But it doesn't seem that excessive. Opie lives a more luxurious life living in a penthouse & raising 2 kids in the upper west side"
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,xxmikekxx,2,Sat Jul 18 04:08:09 2015 UTC,"Opie also still has his 7 figure job, owns his apartment outright which will sell for more than he paid most likely, lives in the city solely because of his job, and will retire to somewhere less expensive.   Opine also comes off as a more sound investor, because he doesn't talk about it. Cumia was always talking about playing the market. Opie seems like the kind of guy with a financial planner, while Anthony comes off as a guy ignoring his financial planner.  Opine is clearly spending less, and not frivolously spending as much as Anthony."

I thought they were playing up on Anthony's race ranting and thought it would be funny to make up a story about how a black woman beat him up.  But no, turns out it was real. He really went out and got into a fight with a woman, got beat up, and then spent the next several days in a Chris Benoitesque hazy frame of mind sending out peculiar messages to random people.  Everyone should have just expected a paid version of Live From The Compound. The guy hasn't worked hard a day in his life. Did you think he was going to start now? At an age when people are getting ready to retire?"

He was a pretty obnoxious racist, and it seemed clear to me that if he was left to his own devices he would do nothing but veer off into extreme ignorance. If anything I was more surprised with the whole O&J situation. I didn't expect Opie to drag it down so far that I'd quit on it. Opie was a lot worse than I realized. It took me awhile before I really got what everyone else was complaining about. He bothered me sometimes with his bullshit but it was never bad enough to turn me off the whole thing until... feb or so. Poor jimmy."

That they would BOTH be so sensitive to every criticism levied at them is astounding. Give the worm credit he can take it a little better than they can. And I'll even give Opie credit -- at least he tried to get professional help. Ant just goes to the bottle.   Do ya fucking think maybe you should try and work out why it is you only go after emotionally wrecked young women? It's not as you claim that you are ""just attracted to them.""  He's completely fucked up and self-deluded. I do actually feel bad for him because he has given thousands of hours of laughs.  But this is his own doing. Opie is everything we've said he is but at the end of the day (sniff) he's just a very dumb person with run of the mill flaws and a few dollars.  Ant becomes less defensible by the day.  You're 60.

opieandanthony,3dn3tr,Produceher,4,Fri Jul 17 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you turned off the episode 10 minutes in, being so above it all.  I thought it was compelling more than anything else.  Opie was putting out some half-truths/vagaries/outright lies to try to stem the hate tide, and Anthony had had it.  I don't blame Anthony for airing his grievances and setting the record straight (or at least his version of it) on his airwaves, given the fact that Opie was telling and perpetuating those porky pies on his airwaves/twitter.  If my partner lied about me/my motives/the situation to try to save face with the fans, and he wouldn't come on my show to clear the air/hash it out/get down to the nitty gritty, and he wouldn't stop lying, either, I'd have blasted him publicly, too.  Opie was just making shit up, left and right, willy nilly, as it suited him.  Fuck that!  Anthony is crashing and burning, and is being overwhelmed by the worst parts of himself, but that doesn't negate the fact that Opie is a shitty, compulsively lying, talentless, borderline retarded coward.  If you want to talk about deserves, Opie deserves much worse than the ""Walking on Greggshells"" episode."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,joomommyhappy,5,Fri Jul 17 20:04:20 2015 UTC,I don't agree. Opie was lying to protect the O&A legacy. No one knew they hated each other. So he pretended to miss Anthony while doing his own show. Show business is full of people pretending to be what they're not. Why wasn't Anthony a liar for not doing the greggshells show before he was fired. Because he was also lying to all of us. To collect a paycheck. Anthony was just as much at afault for their relationship. Anthony was pissed because he was the one on the outside looking in. He lost his gig and was blaming Opie. No. Opie isn't funny or smart. Never was. But he didn't stab his partner in the back just to boost his show. Which is what Anthony did.
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,Produceher,-3,Fri Jul 17 21:46:27 2015 UTC,"""Opie was lying to protect the O&A legacy""?!?!?  I gotta know: does anybody else here believe this horseshit?  But he didn't want to protect the O&A legacy enough to call in or appear on TACS, apparently.  Should we file this ""logic"" in the same folder as ""I fought for Anthony, and yes, I certainly do have clout, Mr. Larry King, sir, but somehow, Anthony hasn't been brought back""?  Opie was obviously only interested in self-preservation, which is fine.  But Opie fucked up by lying about Anthony's motivations/desires, as well as his own actions.  He created this rather elaborate fiction, which is par for his fuckin' course, and Anthony called him out on it.  I don't know why that's bad.  And when called out on it, rather than explain/justify himself, what does Opie do?  He fucking cries!  Anthony wasn't lying when he was working with Opie; he was biting his tongue for the sake of a paycheck.  Big difference.  And like Anthony said on ""Walking on Greggshells"", it's kind of on the guy who still has the gig to be the bigger man.  Anthony coming up small now is overshadowing how small Opie came up in the fallout of the Times Square incident, which was downright microscopic.  Also, why does Opie get a free pass for doing a complete 180 on his stance towards management, and the fact that that was a kind of knife in Anthony's back?  Imagine you think you're partners with a hell raising, take-no-shit rebel, but when the chips are down you find out the guy is really a fucking Smithers-esque bootlick!  You wouldn't feel dicked over?  Of course you would.  But I guess that's ignored for the sake of the Anthony crucifixion."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,joomommyhappy,3,Fri Jul 17 23:07:39 2015 UTC,"Answer me this? How did it hurt Anthony that Opie said that he thought Anthony wanted to do his own show? They hadn't talked. Maybe he really did believe that Anthony wanted to do his own thing. How would he know? And I'm not giving Opie a pass. I canceled my sub. The show sucks ass. But in that battle, Opie took the high road and Ant was a scumbag."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,Produceher,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:11:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't say the ""Anthony wants to do his own thing"" comment hurt Anthony; it just reveals how much Opie was talking out of his ass.  ""I fought for Anthony"" and ""I was trying to protect the brand"" on one hand, and ""Anthony wants to do his own thing"" on the other.  And Opie didn't say he thought Anthony wanted to do his own thing; he stated it as a fact, and presented the ""split the shows"" idea as something that had already been discussed, almost already agreed upon and ready to put into motion, when it hadn't.  Stop and think about how fucking weird that is.    And how the fuck is making up all of that stuff and assuming what someone else's desires are..........desires that just happen to fall in line with what YOU want........""taking the high road""?  But yes, Anthony was just as much to blame for the lack of communication immediately following the Times Square incident/firing, and a lack of communication has been a running character flaw in Anthony.    The difference is, Anthony didn't fill up that communication void with his imagination/wishful thinking, and present it as fact.  Anthony had every right to be upset that Opie did.  But thinking more about it, I do think Anthony should have had that beer with Opie.  Hash it out/say goodbye, in private.  But Anthony clearly didn't want to hash it out; he just wanted to nail Opie to the wall in public, in real-time.  And that is petty pussy shit.  Opie didn't fall for it, because, again, he's got great self-preservation instincts.  He knew he had absolutely no chance of coming off well in a real-time gloves-off debate/hash-out with Anthony.    But don't mistake that for ""the high road"".  Liar McJellyTits has never taken the high road in his life."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,joomommyhappy,2,Sat Jul 18 09:07:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see where we disagree. Have the beer with Opie instead of going off just to create interest in your new show. Lots of stuff happened behind the scenes. Opie didn't break that wall. Ant did. And the fact that none of Opie's lies actually hurt Anthony, proves that Ant was just being petty. Opie never meant Ant any harm. Ant did and was happy that Reddit hated him. Now the tables of turned. He's getting what he deserves."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,Produceher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:41 2015 UTC,"And Opie didn't say he thought Anthony wanted to do his own thing;    Yeah, actually he did. I'm not gonna bother to go back and listen to the first post-Ant show, and I doubt you are either, but that's exactly what he said. Paraphrasing: ""I really think he wants to do his own thing for awhile.""   he stated it as a fact, and presented the ""split the shows"" idea as something that had already been discussed, almost already agreed upon and ready to put into motion, when it hadn't.   No, he certainly did not. He made it pretty clear that the split shows thing was something that had never been beyond his own internal thinking. Of course it was a dumb move, because there was no way of proving he ever really did consider it, and it gave plenty of ammo to for Ant's followers to goad him into attacking Opie for it."

Sorry about that.  But Opie did say that Anthony knew they were near the end (before he got fired), which I believe Anthony also disputes.  Apparently Anthony didn't just know that; he ""fucking knows that!"".  https://youtu.be/WYeUW7jF14g?t=57  Do you believe that?    I don't."

IDK. I only remember him actually saying the ""Ant wants to do his own thing"", with or without ""I think"" that one time, directly after the firing. Every other time I heard it was on here from people bringing up that same byte, ie: the two threads you just linked. It's also worth noting that at the time Opie was speaking on what he thought Ant wanted to do now that he had been fired, not what he thought Ant was looking to do beforehand.  The clip you link though certainly doesn't make Opie come off very well. It's not quite the same situation there, but it doesn't help Opie to speak on behalf of what Ant actually knows, when by this point it had already been made clear that they weren't speaking outside of work."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,BenjaminRCaineIII,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:01:48 2015 UTC,Exactly. The knee jerk dummies who base their perspectives on their emotional state at the time have forgotten that Opie was the one who started shit by lying about Ant's motives.

opieandanthony,3dn3tr,That70smoke,7,Fri Jul 17 19:53:45 2015 UTC,They haven't though. Opie has officially put Anthony on the Pay-No-Mind list. The hostilities are entirely one-sided. Opie hasn't mentioned him since April; and it will probably stay that way until O&J do the Anthony Cumia Tribute show when he croaks.
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,fratboy_massacre,6,Fri Jul 17 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it really hasn't been a slow and steady burn. It's been a conflagration he happily presides over. Like Nero in Rome. Laughing at his fans and supporters as he takes their gladhanding and throws it back in their faces. He really, really has contempt for his audience in a way I've never seen in another performer. He hates them so I think this, while extremely self-destructive (which is his forte--let's face it), is cathartic for him. It will leave him destitute, but it seems to be destined. And yes, it's been absolutely a joy to watch as I hate the fucker. The last of his sycophants are his most naturally Stormfront-y and pathologically co-dependent, so... he'll always have those born losers. He'll probably murder/suicide with some of them in his bunk...compound."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,panjshirlion,4,Fri Jul 17 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, did you ever like Opie and Anthony? I mean, I agree with your current assessment, but your hate is prodigiously intense, even for this sub."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,joomommyhappy,3,Fri Jul 17 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It's sad and disturbing and fascinating.  We are witnessing a man weighing himself down with his horrible habits/trains of thought/obsessions, grinding himself and his legacy, such as it was, into a fine paste.  He's kind of ""brother Joe-ifying"" himself.  I'm a new fan who liked O&A backwards, via YouTube clips.  It's become painfully obvious that the Anthony in those clips is dead.  He fell into a booze-filled/young retarded skank/racist/Fox News pit, and he seems hell-bent on staying in it.  And somewhere in that pit he lost his sense of humor, worst of all the sense of humor about himself and his foibles/felonious tendencies.  It's strange how the comedy talk-radio greats aren't anymore: Stern, Patrice (RIP), Artie Lange, and Anthony.  Ironically, Artie, a junkie who literally tried to kill himself a couple of times, is really the only survivor thus far.  He's the only one who's still hanging with what made him what he was.  Barely, but he's still hanging on.  You could argue that Anthony was always like this, but it was manageable, in the background.  The funny used to come first.  Now, it's not coming at all."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,MeteorBlitzkieg,9,Fri Jul 17 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"Artie, even in his addicted state of mind, knows how to be likable.  Ant thinks he's a rock star when he's just a very lucky person whose luck ran out."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,joomommyhappy,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"No, Anthony was a lot more than that; he was genuinely funny and talented.  A quick wit with a couple of good impressions at the ready and a rather broad general knowledge base, not to mention quite the colorful past, chock full o' interesting stories.  But yeah, Anthony would do well to take a few pages out of Artie's ""likability"" book.    The funny thing about Artie is he plays with race/racial stereotypes all the time.  But he does it in a playful, benign, funny way.  He can admit to and poke fun of his own (very mild/generic/almost tongue-in-cheek) racism, but it doesn't control/dominate him.  He's got tons of black friends and can move in and out of all racial conversations effortlessly.    He got in trouble for some racially-themed tweets, but it was only from people who didn't understand them, or humor in general."
opieandanthony,3dn3tr,johnnyroberts,2,Sat Jul 18 10:41:09 2015 UTC,I still think its a bit. Ant and Gregg sit in the treefort at night and read each others Twitter responders and giggle while Jimmy jerks off in the corner.

opieandanthony,3dn3tr,JuiceBusters,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"It's a funny thing. sometimes 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' gets swung too far.   Having said that, I think Cumia was in the right over the firing (which is just sickening PC garbage) and he's then handled the Opie-Breakup account well. Suprisingly well-spoken, honest, mature.  Otherwise, hes a creepy douchefuck like Opie and Jimmy and I don't really care about his podcast at all. Its not horrible but his talent is a color-commentator, impersonator etc.  Thing is - its taking a long long time for all of them to fail. So long that really there can be no satisfaction for anyone here. At worst OpieTits fades away in mostly very comfortable upper-middle class early retirement after 5 more years at Sirius in some capacity (tho nothing like the big O&A years).   Norton will disappear from radio and TV about a year from now but actually earn enough as a road-warrior road comic doing enough 'Red-Eye' or little appearances now and then. Basically earning enough to maintain a decent NY apartment and not dying of AIDS for 20 more years.  Anthony will have to dramatically slow down his lifestyle YET still keep the 'compound' after the parties stop, the pool stops being heated and he drifts into being an old queen in his later 60s.   No major 'Aha take that faggots!' for any of these 90s douchebags. sorry to say."

Ant on O&A was the damn show - whether he was angry, the professor, mean and shitty, doing impressions, riffing and laughing with Jimmy, carrying Opie etc. he was always ALWAYS entertaining. It's over you fuck. Stop trying to make LOS happen you dinks. The show we once had will never be again.   GET FUCKING OVER IT!"
opieandanthony,3ds2c1,Grandmas_Dick,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:55 2015 UTC,Not to mention the fact that Dave is a bomb factory.

opieandanthony,3ds2c1,Heifsin85,2,Sat Jul 18 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Dave isn't Ant, yet, but Luis is unquestionably funnier than Opie and Big Jay is more than up to being Jim Norton."
opieandanthony,3ds2c1,BeerCanThick,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:42 2015 UTC,Big Jay is hilarious and where he surpasses Jim is that he knows when something is outside of his realm of knowledge and doesn't pretend to be an expert.  You won't hear Big Jay try to break down the Israel/Palestine conflict or delve into the world of theoretical physics or singularity.  He is comfortable being funny without feeling like he also has to impress people with his faux expertise.  Renaissance Man Jimmy is an unfortunate character.

opieandanthony,3dqs8f,wizardnug,3,Sun Jul 19 02:13:57 2015 UTC,Hi Benjamin!
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,WhatMade,7,Sun Jul 19 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"Opie has come to the depressing realization the only clothes he had were patrice, bobo and the anthony jacket. He isn't going to become Stern or anything else. Its over. He's a company man who hopes to renew at a reduced price long enough to retire. He has left zero to anyone's memory or reputation or legendary status or career respect.   That's not a nice place to be after all. Finding out you were mediocre and lucky all along while saying 'Yes, sir' to the bosses you told to go fuck themselves just 3 years ago and reminding them you're getting help for that 'anger disorder' you're sorry about.   Not a nice place to be. It might be better to crash and burn.  He genuinely wants to keep it going with 90s comedians, steer topics into ""first time making cumzies"" for hours at a time, rave about the Stone Temple Pilots, try to cruely humiliate Falcone because Falcone is stuck 10 years behind Opies time which is 1998 yet incredibly Falcone is more self-aware than Opie himself.  That's not a good place to be.   Trying to get the phones lit up by SJWing for 'Caitlyn Jenner' ugh.   That's not a good place to be. Don't feel sorry for him but Opie hasn't won a thing except the lottery :("
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,JuiceBusters,2,Sat Jul 18 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Opie's a very successful ordinary guy, more successful than 99% of people ever. Professionally, and honestly, I think in terms of family as well, even though it's easy to shit on that aspect of his life because of the private schooling and stuff. He has his shit together.  He's just unfortunate enough to have a mic shoved in front of his face every day."
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,MSteve1232000,6,Sat Jul 18 19:59:21 2015 UTC,He won by default. Hard to compete with a man making millions at sirius when you're in your basement selling dick spray
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,ShaneMichaelOfficial,3,Sat Jul 18 16:29:37 2015 UTC,"Plus O&J got the new studio, new sleek and hd video, and say what you want the dude got Lettermans longtime producers. Would you rather have that or a racist, former nypd officer as producer?"
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,maynardsabeast,4,Sat Jul 18 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"The only actual reason Opie won is because his show is still better.  Ant could be in the exact same situation he's in, but if he was putting on a good show he'd at least have won in my eyes.  I only care about the entertainment factor, and O+J is more entertaining.  The guy just can't carry a radio show on his own.  I listened to the whole episode of Bennington from Thursday and Ant could really take some pointers from Ron.  He talks by himself for a good chunk of the show and still keeps it funny and interesting.  If Ant just wants to talk race and radical Islam now, that's fine, but his fan base doesn't want it and it will ruin him beyond repair in the end."
opieandanthony,3dqs8f,DeRosas_livelihood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"Are you guys retarded?  Do you have any idea how many advantages Opie has over Anthony?  He gets to keep the studio.  He gets to keep working for the giant company that can get him any guest he wants.  He gets to keep the audience.  He gets to keep the staff we are all familar with.  He get to have all the comedian guests on any day he wants.  Most of all, he gets to keep Jim Norton as the co-host.  Ant was just sent to his basement, and told to start from scratch.  And his network has improved greatly, with the additions of Legions of Skanks and Gavin mcinnes show.  And once he moves to his studio I expect his show to get good."

opieandanthony,3dqs8f,ShaneMichaelOfficial,2,Sat Jul 18 18:15:10 2015 UTC,"Opie please stop posting here. We aren't going to start liking you just because Anthony seems to have gone off the deep end. He may suck now, but you have been an abysmal twat for many years, and anyone who listened close didn't need Anthony's Greggshells video to point this out.  You were never at Anthony's level. Anthony has been in the process of bringing himself down to yours, and that is why he is being smashed now. Stop making sockpuppet accounts and trying to steer the Anthony trashing into Opie love. Stop trying to make love happen, as for you it never will. SXM torched a great institution, and O&J is just you pissing all over the ashes of said institution. TACS holds no interest for me either, anymore than listening to any of the fucking Beatles solo work. 1/4 of band=1/4 as good. And no, O&J doesn't equal 2/3, as Jim's excellence is as usual stifled by your hole-ness.  To put it in simpler terms, dust off that Spuds Buckley costume, and prepare for your eventual slide back to morning zoo radio, maybe Bearman can use you. Cause you sir, are a goddamn disgrace."
