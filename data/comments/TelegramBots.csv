TelegramBots,3d83jm,sathyabhat,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"You'll need a command for users to opt in to the notifications. Once that is done you'll need to keep checking and processing /getUpdates api route to keep track of which users are opting in. Write the user IDs to a file or a database. Have another script to check the file or db, and send the message.  You can either have the sending script run infinitely and send the messages at specific time, or schedule sending using cron jobs.  To give you an idea, check my script: https://github.com/sathyabhat/themnewsbot which is a WIP reddit news bot"

TelegramBots,3bqsi2,cheanizer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:59:14 2015 UTC,You can't get the image directly. You only get the id of the picture to resend it.
TelegramBots,3bqsi2,schmidtflo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:55:03 2015 UTC,yes. but how to download the image from file_id?

TelegramBots,3bmi7x,Endurans,2,Tue Jun 30 12:30:52 2015 UTC,This is possible but it the Telegram client would have to support (for example) soundcloud integration in order for it to be nice. Otherwise it will just be a link. You can use the @YouTubeSearchBot (disclaimer: its mine) for this purpose. For example: @YouTubeSearchBot youtube sexy and i know it will return that specific song. Or any song that is on youtube.
TelegramBots,3bmi7x,UndefinedB,2,Tue Jun 30 13:31:19 2015 UTC,"There is @GetMusicBot https://telegram.me/GetMusicBot But, as UndefinedB said until it sends links only."

TelegramBots,3blk3v,codesharer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"I had that all set up, assuming it would work. Problem is that apparently when calling getUpdate any messages that are replies between users that aren't the bot don't get received at all. So the only time the reply_to_message returns a message is when the replied to message is a message from the bot. It's a problem, maybe on their end."

TelegramBots,3baqwt,liryna,3,Sat Jun 27 12:14:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's very unnecessary to go through a third party Telegram bot hosted on someones computer to visit Facebook, especially since the bot will see everything you do.   Even though Telegram is a reasonably secure platform, the actual bots themselves offer no guaranteed security.  You can still make it of course, but even making a source available doesn't guarantee no personal details will be harvested by the actual software running the bot or whatever else you want to do with it.  Besides, Facebook has an app on all platforms we have Telegram clients for. So while it's a good programming challenge, it might not be the best bot idea. ;)"
TelegramBots,3baqwt,Laloeka,2,Sat Jun 27 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"Facebook does not guaranteed more security/privacy than a bot.  With a bot you will even win as privacy because Facebook will lost your location tracking. And even all the android/ios/... spy permissions.  I still think that it is interesting idea ! :D  But you make the point, nobody should trust me if I want to propose to host it !"
TelegramBots,3baqwt,Laloeka,2,Sat Jun 27 16:16:11 2015 UTC,"With a bot you will even win as privacy because Facebook will lost your location tracking.   That's not true. While facebook probably won't be able to track your location, you still risk the bot being made by an evil developer who steals your account :P  I'm not saying you are such an evil developer, but I wouldn't want to trust a random bot with access to my account :)"

Bear in mind that this program uses a python library called requests, that you may have to install on your system.

TelegramBots,3b8kf3,lengchye,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, well you see. Github won't actually help you to run that code. Github is more of a web tool for hosting your Git projects. If you're not familiar with Github or aren't sure what Git is, I wouldn't worry too much about that right now. What you want to do is install Python for your system.   If you're on a Unix system (Mac or Linux), you'll probably already have Python installed. If you're on Windows, I recommend you have a look at this page, to learn how to configure and install Python as well as learn the basics on how to use it.  When all that is taken care of, use your python command line or system shell, to navigate to the folder where you have your bot file and you can run it like so:   python my_bot_file_name.py    I'll be sure to update my post so that it's a bit more clear on this part."

TelegramBots,3b8kf3,themegabyte,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:40:30 2015 UTC,"Nothing actually. I'm the one at fault here because I forgot to mention that bit.  ""Requests"" is a python library that allows you to communicate via HTTP requests with the telegram bot server. By default, it doesn't come included with your python distribution so you'll need to install it.  First install pip by following those three steps. Pip is a tool for managing your system's Python packages (like requests).  then, on your shell run (you only need to to this once)    pip install requests   And that's that. your python program should now run without raising any issues! Hope this helped."

TelegramBots,3b79hp,Valdieme,2,Fri Jun 26 19:55:36 2015 UTC,Forgive me if I'm wrong. I think the information you're missing is this   Telegram Bots are special accounts that do not require an additional phone number to set up. These accounts serve as an interface for code running somewhere on your server.    Which means that you need to have a server your bots can access to and run your code from

TelegramBots,3b79hp,Laloeka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"Well, if you just want to fool around with the API a bit the best way to go around doing this is to first create a bot of your own and test code running on your machine. If you already did that much, and would like to have a 24/7 working bot than I suggest you do a little research on how to buy and setup a web server."
TelegramBots,3b79hp,Valdieme,3,Fri Jun 26 20:27:38 2015 UTC,I had a conversation via PM about this; if you want you could easily run a bot on a Raspberry Pi. It's a lot cheaper than renting a VPS. :)

TelegramBots,3b2s35,UndefinedB,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:57 2015 UTC,I noticed that BotFather didn't reply at all if the bot creation was successful. If the name was taken it does respond.

TelegramBots,3b20j2,Laloeka,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:16 2015 UTC,You can only remove the bot ( or any user ) if you added it.
