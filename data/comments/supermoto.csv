supermoto,3dvgw1,happyshlappy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"If you just want power, get the drz. For everything else, get the klx.   I've only ridden a klx with the big bore 350 motor, and it still felt sluggish compared to my DRZ with a full pipe and 3x3. Although having a 6th gear is priceless.   But that's just my 2 cents. Get whatever bike that calls to you the most. You won't be disappointed with either bike. Especially coming from a gs500"
supermoto,3dvgw1,Motocid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"The KLX will probably struggle with your weight. The DRZ isn't impressive power wise, and then you have the old KLX 250 that makes even less.  I wouldn't do it, but it's your call. Ride both bikes, make your decision based on that."
supermoto,3dvgw1,Karlen89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"What version of KLX is it? Is it R or one of the S models?   btw if the bike is stock it's gutless. im riding a 330 big bore KLX250R. With the big bore kit, it's a lot better than stock and I can bring the front up in first and second and hold it to 4th gear, so you can still hoon around on it like any other SM. It's really a quality machine but even with the kit, the power leaves something to be desired. Another note is if you're using a stock size rear rim (10 cm wide) then you'll have issues with the back end sliding out in the wet or when you're leaning a lot."
supermoto,3dvgw1,Vital_Cobra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"Is the SF, what size tire is the rear. And where would I get a big bore kit?"
supermoto,3dvgw1,Vital_Cobra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:39:20 2015 UTC,"If it's SF i'd probably advise against buying it. I like the R because it's tall and I actually like the great enduro suspension on the road. I rode my friend's SF and it was smaller, had stiff suspension and was really gutless. I was struggling to do wheelies in first. Someone your weight coming from a GS500 you'll probably be really disappointed with the stock bike and it's not worth all the effort of the mods required to make it go when you can just buy a DRZ or any other 400+ cc sumo. That said if you just want a cheap commuter and don't want to go hooning it's still okay for the price. Check thumpertalk for info on the kits (here's a link). As for the tyres, I think the SF model comes stock with wider road tyres so you should be fine."
supermoto,3dvgw1,DrZed400,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:22 2015 UTC,Go for the drz. It's a better bike for the money
supermoto,3dvgw1,mx5zeroeight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"I've owned both. The KLX was a lot smaller and lighter, but like everyone says, it has no power. It's slow as fuck. Bought a DRZ because I wanted something bigger, and the power difference is HUGE. Even though the DRZ isn't really a fast bike, it's a huge difference from the KLX. 1/4 throttle on the DRZ is about the same as full throttle on the KLX. I do miss 6th gear though."
supermoto,3dvgw1,eurofra1d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"Go with the drz. There is a huge aftermarket for them, way more parts out there than for the klx. You'll be bored with a 250 in a month or two"

On a track, work on your lines, with good lines come speed, with speed comes lean angles, with angles come knee dragging.

supermoto,3dvaqy,theRealCrazy,3,Sun Jul 19 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"therealcrazy has it right. Just keep working on your line and stepping the speed up, eventually it will happen.

As far as form, one cheek off is enough, get on the balls of your feet and rotate your inside out leg so your heel is touching the heel guard. Anchor yourself w/ your outside leg."

supermoto,3dteru,MrSilverFox,2,Sun Jul 19 07:28:42 2015 UTC,Nice clean WR. Are you on stock suspension?  Edit: good gearing for a small-to-medium sized supermoto track is about 14/46
supermoto,3dteru,agentnico,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. Yeah running the stock stuff, I'm going to take it out for a play in the twisties with a notepad and a screwdriver and test different suspension configurations. I'm going to see if I can get away with keeping this on it for a few track days and races and deciding if investing the coin in upgrading is for me. I'm keen on a steering damper however.   Awesome I'll keep that advice in mind. After a ride the other day I'm going to change it to 14:47 for the first track day and coaching lessons; I'll be on a medium size track (it was more suited to my R6 than my R1) so I might pick up a 46 and 45 to take with me and change if I feel the need."
supermoto,3dteru,agentnico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"you'll find stock WR suspension is severly under-dampened for supermoto track use. best setup will be to just turn the rebound and compression adjusters all the way in, then back out one click.   a supermoto suspension setup is more like road race suspension; slower, firmer dampening.   you can still enjoy the stock WR on track of course, it'll just be a loose and pitching around a lot :)"

supermoto,3dnzgg,SumoSect,2,Fri Jul 17 20:43:13 2015 UTC,"So if you scroll down to the bottom that's how my adventure started.  Decided to take my bike out and a fairly long trip. Went to Yosemite, auberry, sequoia  national forest, and finally took a road anywhere to find where it ends.   After taking a break at a cafe in the mountain I get back on the bike heading down. Now this road down the mountain is just filled with numerous switch backs, twisties, and really bad off camber corners.  What happened: Decided to take it easy rolling down at 30mph. There's a car behind me tailgating very hard. I think in my head no big deal take the next turn wide and pull off. Well dinglefritz  behind me didn't want to do that. Decides to over take me in the corner. OH WAIT THERE'S A CAR IN FRONT OF HIM. So he swerves into me. I lock my rear, then tapped my front brake.   It wasn't enough. Or rather it was too much front brake. Definitely  too much front brake.. I had no where to go but down the side. Thankfully there were small  trees. Bike goes right I go left end over end.  I collect myself, climb painfully back up to the road and survey everything. Took me a good 15 minutes to pull the bike out. Front brake cable was pinched. Major plastic damage. I haven't checked since last night. Limped myself home about 45 minutes away. That was awful to do.    So. I'm alive. Pretty freaked out about the ducking cager.  I was attgatt except  my jacket rolled up (wtf right?) And my back took a little bit of damage.  Lesson learned: Cars are lava."

supermoto,3der0k,volcanonacho,2,Wed Jul 15 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Don't think those are Supermoto tires. They look too skinny. Could be wrong.   Take a look at the Avon distanzias if you want to go on dirt a bit. They're not bad.
supermoto,3der0k,pwndrone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"Do they make them in the right size for your bike? Rear sizing is quite limited to 160/60-17 and 180/55-18.   Anyway, I've sold a set and the guy really likes them. Took it out on a bigger dual sport to Colorado and he said they hooked up well. I do not have any personal experience with them.   They are similar to the Distanzia, but with a bit softer compound, and more tread pattern."
supermoto,3der0k,paulrulez742,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"You could run a softer MT60 RS up front and the MT60 rear, assuming you've got 17's on your bike. The RS is basically a sportbike tire with pseudo-offroad tread."
supermoto,3der0k,agentnico,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:26:49 2015 UTC,Try posting in r/dualsport. Might have better luck over there.
supermoto,3der0k,james_hughes,0,Thu Jul 16 03:04:38 2015 UTC,The MT60 is a grippier tire than the Avon Distanzia and Avon Distanzia SM compound. I've personally not used the MT60 but I've had a couple of friends who have. They had also used the Avon Distanzia SM tires and they said the MT60s were better. Depending on your riding you may want to look into the Avons though. I ran several sets of Distanzia SMs on my KTM when I used to own it and I could nearly scrape peg on the streets and I never felt any loss of traction. For a set of block tread tires they had grip for days on asphalt and were very compliant in dirt/sand. On mud they weren't the greatest but rider skill can make up for that.
supermoto,3dce8c,MajictheImaginative,3,Wed Jul 15 04:19:30 2015 UTC,"For the first service it's pretty important to bring it in, especially on a single cylinder 4-stroke. Also don't let that one guy get you down, I'd just suggest going to areas where bikes meet up or any place with good roads. If you meet someone else who is carving up the twisties, odds are they won't mind someone tagging along.  Also if you want to find some good roads to ride on in your area, Google Earth  (not Google maps) is your friend. Just zoom in enough to see the roads then scroll around looking for anything that resembles a snake having a seizure."

supermoto,3dbqjn,Jedixscum,2,Wed Jul 15 01:05:38 2015 UTC,"I've owned a couple WR450's and one of them did quite a bit of street duty, it's the best way to go if you want a lot of performance without having to do constant maintenence. the motor is incredibly stout for something that's essentially a race power plant with some minor modifications. the downside is it's more raw and uncompromising on the street (read: vibes), a softer seat would be a good idea right away if you go that route. for my sensibilities, it's the best choice for an all around street/track/dirt supermoto."
supermoto,3dbqjn,agentnico,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:25:41 2015 UTC,How bad is maintenance compared to the drz?
supermoto,3dbqjn,agentnico,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"I don't have any hard numbers for you to compare, but fairly frequent oil changes and occasional valve-clearance checks are the best way to keep a WR healthy. they only hold a quart of oil so it's cheap to change, but also means it's more likely to need an oil swap often compared to a DRZ, which holds 2 quarts. honestly I've almost never seen a WR450 need a valve adjustment. great design for something that powerful."
supermoto,3dbqjn,agentnico,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:55 2015 UTC,Awesome I'm pretty positive I'm going to go with the wr. Just have to find out how hard it is to get one street legal and plated in WV or find one already legal.
supermoto,3dbqjn,DaneGlesac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"Good luck, I'd recommend an alum-framed '07 or newer because oil changes are a bit simpler. But the older steel-frame WR450's are just as reliable and fast."
supermoto,3dbqjn,BugJuice_27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:02 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the wr250x or wr450f?
supermoto,3dbqjn,Glockamolee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:06 2015 UTC,Wr450f should have made that more clear haha
supermoto,3dbqjn,timtoronto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:49:42 2015 UTC,"I can tell you you right from the start that the WR450 will be more fun. Bike has a lot more power. Nothing will beat the bulletproof reliability of a dizzer though and If you install the very popular Keihin FCR MX 39mm carb its a whole new bike. Really wakes the bike up. Anyways I'd ask Jake TheGardenSnake. Comment on his YouTube Channel. He rides a Yamaha WR450f. He has had that bike for a while now. He used to have a DRZ. You can watch his videos... He might even have some videos in regards to maintenance and what not. I do remember him putting card board over his radiators during the cold years because it was getting too cold and the bike didn't have a thermostat or something like that...sorry I forgot. It also depends on where you live...I live in Cali and it would be a pain in the rear to get one of those plated. Also note, I have a DRZ myself and its my only source of transportation. I ride it every day. 14k miles and running strong. Valves are still in spec as well. Never once have been adjusted. I also ride the bike really really hard! Canyons, wheelies, off road, stoppies, hooliganism, and such. Personally Id say for first bike get yourself a DRZ. I ride the DRZ comfortably around 75 mph on the freeway with a relatively stock bike. Stock gearing as well."
supermoto,3dbqjn,DrZed400,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:03:24 2015 UTC,Drz will be fine on the highway. I have no idea bout the wr 450. You might just be doing more maintenance on it.

No risk of clogging holes therefore increasing rotor/pad wear.   This is specifically used with the 6 piston caliper. The have another 320 for use in the 4 piston.

Primarily weekend rides? Track riding?   The XR650R and XR650L are very different bikes IMO, if you haven't ridden both to compare, I would highly recommend doing so beforehand.   The DRZ400 seems to be the bike of choice on this sub, and is a bit lighter than most XRs. They are dead reliable, with much longer spans between oil changes/service requirements than the MX-based bikes. The WR/YZ/CRFs are all going to need more maintenance/valves checked more often etc.   The XR650L is still in production, hit up your dealer and compare it to the DRZ400/WR before you make a decision, if at all possible.. If you are coming from a sport bike you may find the XR-L a bit ploddy compared to a DRZ or converted CRF/WR/YZ-F."
supermoto,3cu2o3,roboticbobwhite,2,Fri Jul 10 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"First bike was a Suzuki gs500, I've owned a zx6r, and rode a sv1000 for a long time. Last summer I rode My dad's tw200 and had an absolute blast. It was the first time I've ridden a dirt bike, and I loved it. I figured a super moto would be like combining the fun of the springy suspension with the capabilities of a street bike. That way I can go off road a bit, although the majority of my riding will be the street.   I won't do much freeway, although there may be some. The majority of My riding will be surface streets and canyons with occasional fire trails. I kinda just want a bike I can have fun on without doing triple digits.   I've thought about the drz400sm but I feel like everyone says it's slow and heavy. Ideally I'd want the KTM 690sm but I don't want to pay KTM money (and I've heard bad things about reliability). I'd love a husqavarna 650 Terra but I don't think they make those anymore. And it also seems a bit pricey compared to other bikes.   Thanks for replying and giving me advice! I'd love to hear any more advice you have to give."
supermoto,3cu2o3,roboticbobwhite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:03:21 2015 UTC,"Oil changes on the MX-type bikes are not difficult, as another poster stated. 20 minutes max, and only 5 minutes of it is actual ""work.""   If speed is not your #1 goal (ie 70-75mph is ok with you for a sumo), and you though the TW200 was fun, I would not hesitate to go for a CRF/WR/YZ-F/KTM/KX-F conversion.   I ride a CRF250X personally, but I only weigh 120lbs, so it has plenty of getup and go for me, and I do like the electric start. I really like the look of the DRZ, but at 50-75lbs heavier I'll stick with my CRF. I have gotten pretty good at reshimming the valves, which takes 30-45 minutes to check/reshim.   If you are hesitant to try the DRZ400SM (~300lb/35hp), the XR650L will probably be even more of a disappointment (~350lb/31hp). The XR650R is a beast with mods, but stock is similar to the DRZ at 300lb/35hp. Unless you intend to fly across the desert at 100 mph, it again may not be the best choice. A converted MX will likely be in the 240-270lb range and in my opinion you can definitely feel the difference in weight vs a 300lb bike.  I think it really depends on where you are located, some locales have very slim pickings, some have plenty of supermotos but at a high price, so you may need to be patient. I would not rule out an already converted 250 if you are somewhere that supermotos are not common. You can always resell the 250 when a nice 450+ comes along; supermotos are very ""in"" right now so they seem to have very little depreciation.

supermoto,3cmw8v,Dr_TattyWaffles,3,Thu Jul 9 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"That's a clean bike, and the price is good. I have a 1999 LC4 Supermoto. It has different suspension, bars, clocks and bodywork but the motor and frame are the same.   They are pretty reliable only if maintained right. The oil needs to be replaced every 3,000km, and there is some oil in the frame too. this needs to be filled and bled of air once the oil is changed. Checking and adjusting the tappet clearances really helps the engine too.  There is a clutch bearing that has been known to fail on pre 2003 LC4 engines, some failed very earlier, others never. I replaced mine during an engine rebuild, it was in perfect shape but I changed it as preventative measure! Ask if its been done! But like I said, its speculation as to whether it will go or not.  The bottom end of my engine was on the way out at 26,000km but I think that was due to previous neglect on the oil changes. Many people have has up to 100,000km on LC4's with stock engines.  That bike has the FCR Keihin carburettor, the ultimate upgrade for these bikes! They can cost up to 400 dollars for a second hand one! It improves EVERYTHING. Starting, running, wheelies. I want to get one for mine but I could get one so I just rebuilt the stock Mikuni.  Start the bike cold and listen to the engine, it will sound very rough if you are used to Hondas, but listen for obvious hollow sounds and bad valve chatter.   If you take it for a ride, try to ignore the vibration! It's a very buzzy bike."

supermoto,3clj4d,talkingxbird,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:34 2015 UTC,depends! pretty far back on faster knee down sportbike style corners. if it's a really tight corner[s] i'll sit far forward on the tank mx style with my foot out but on the roads i ride it's sitting back on the seat knee down for everything
supermoto,3clj4d,overlordkitty,2,Fri Jul 17 13:07:27 2015 UTC,"Sit as far up front as you can when cornering to put weight on the forks, this is why they stick their leg out too. For everyday riding, just sit on the middle/frontish, it's not like you're an MX racer  Besides that...don't duck foot your pegs, , and thigh squeeze your bike like you're lovers"
supermoto,3clj4d,PenguinScotty,0,Wed Jul 8 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"You can still ride the KLX in a similar fashion to how you rode the 636.    The main advantages of the more Supermoto/MX style of riding is that it allows for faster transitions between corners, which is very rarely needed on the street.  The other thing is that you tend to turn SM/MX bikes with the throttle a lot (Supermoto, the backing in aspect actually swings the bike around, aligning you for the corner exit, whereas in MX you control your turning with the throttle)  As overlordkitty said, due to the length of the forks, your front end will feel vastly different to your 636 and will take some getting used to.  The other thing is that the bike will move around more underneath you (Softer and higher suspension, weight further up, etc.).  So yeah, don't worry about changing your riding style up.  Leaning with the bike is still right, just be aware of the differences between the two bikes in regards to feel."
supermoto,3cisbp,vanillagueriller,2,Wed Jul 8 06:09:05 2015 UTC,"I love KTMs but have always felt that they didn't hold enough oil for street use. I had a 625 SMC which had oil in the downtube but it was nothing like what you have there. Wow, what a bike."
supermoto,3cisbp,TMC_61,2,Wed Jul 8 11:10:06 2015 UTC,Does it hold less than the .75qt my CRF does on the engine side?
supermoto,3cisbp,pj2d2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"My bike runs 1.25 litres (1.32us quarts or 0.33 gallons) which I think is pretty alright. I guess oil is pretty expensive in Australia, but I pay bout $36 for a gallon of 10w50 fully synthetic and I get about 3 complete bleeds and refills out of that + a little squirt bottle for other uses on the bike."
supermoto,3cisbp,pj2d2,0,Wed Jul 8 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"I was actually buying a gallon of the cheaper non synth Shell Rotella (in the US) for around $10 I think it was. Since capacity was so low, I was changing it like every other week when I was riding it every day. Engine side only oil changes on the CRF are less than a ten minute job."
supermoto,3cisbp,pj2d2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:26:48 2015 UTC,"How do you mean when you say engine side only? KTM oil changes are just a plug on the top of the clutch cover, and 2 bleed ones undernearth, and you just remove all 3 and flow a bit of oil through till you see amber rather than black come out the bottom. Filters and oil screens can take a bit longer, but I can probably knock over an oil change in about as much time as my funnel can seep oil into the engine."
supermoto,3cisbp,pj2d2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:15 2015 UTC,"CRF has separate oil for engine and tranny; first time I encountered this myself on a bike. The plus side is the tranny stays clean for a while, and you can run different oil - which Honda actually specs out. I want to say their engine side spec has moly in it, which isn't good for clutches as far as I know."
supermoto,3cisbp,pj2d2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"That is pretty cool. I believe there was something like that with KTM's and the difference between an exc and an exc-r was a seperating thing in the engine. I'm guessing you have a 250 or a 450 supermoto, and if so, do you have any pics? I was about 15 mins away from buying a crf450 for my first supermoto but it would need converting to road legal and I just thought fuck it in the end."

I don't have any recent pics, but that's pretty much what it looks like minus the stickers, and has a Leo Vince can on it. Oh, and dirtier too.   It's a 450X, so it already had the lights on it. Previous owner put turn signals on it, so I lucked out there. It's actually almost impossible to make these road legal in Florida, but if another state deems it road legal, and issues a title for it, Florida will accept it. I drove 6 hours and bought it from a guy in Mississippi. I had to do the SM conversion myself, but it's the second one I've done so that wasn't a big deal."
supermoto,3cisbp,hangerbaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"That looks really fucking nice, must be so much fun to ride. The states have some pretty crazy titling laws on dirt bikes. As far as I know in Australia, you can pretty much get any dirt bike road registered as long as it has headlight, indicators, plate, chain guard and kickstand and approved tires, I have mates who ride road registered cr500 2 stroke engines in crf250 frames and ride those bikes through the city, 0 problems getting that registered. 450x sounds about right, think it was a 450r that I was looking at and would have been a drama to get it to a road legal status and would have had to buy a wiring harness and everything. What rear tyre are you running there? I have a 160/60 on the kato and that is gorgeous but its got about 2.5mm clearance either side of the swingarm (picture)"
supermoto,3cisbp,garo8703,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, each state is different. I've heard you can plate lawn mowers and quads in some states, but other states it's impossible. If I didn't score this bike or a WR450, I was considering a KTM/Berg/Husky since they're easy to tag here in the states. The Honda has been great though.  I have a 150 on the rear 4.25"" rim because I didn't want to hassle with dishing wheel and running spacers. I'm pretty sure you can fit a 5"" rim and a 160, but I'm not fast enough to notice the difference anyway.   Honestly, I'm not riding the motard that much lately. Kind of saddens me since it was a blast when I first got it, but we really don't have many good roads around here (Florida is flat with a lot of straight roads). I used to ride through town to work, but my work moved and it's easier to jump on the highway with my Tiger 800. Not sure what I would get next. Thinking something naked like a Street Triple or FZ-09. Also considered a Honda grom. Rode one in Thailand recently, and it was so much damn fun!"
supermoto,3cisbp,RyanTally,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"2013 KTM 500's have 1.5L.. there are engine cover mods that add oil capacity.  Being a wet clutch, in our case, engine oil is shared with the clutch. Depending on your clutch  setups, for example a rekluse, they recommend trying;   What oil do you recommend? Let's start with oils we do not recommend. Any oil formulated for automotive use is not recommended and in general, should not be used in motorcycle applications. This includes conventional and synthetic oils formulated for automotive use. Modern automotive oils do not contain the anti-wear additives necessary for proper lubrication in a motorcycle engine and may contain high quantities of friction modifiers that can cause excessive clutch slip. That said, in most cases the oil you use should work fine in all Rekluse clutches However, some riders may find they experience clutch squeal, clutch chatter or have problems with clutch slip. If you experience these problems, we recommend trying Shell Rotella T, a heavy-duty, conventional diesel engine oil.   At Rekluse, we have found Shell Rotella T (15W-40) provides excellent clutch performance and often eliminates customer complaints of clutch problems. Why do we recommend conventional diesel engine oil over synthetic? In general, we have found conventional oils perform slightly better at reducing clutch noise vs synthetic oils. However, many Rekluse customers get excellent performance with synthetic oils. The bottom line: If your current oil is working fine, keep using it. If you're hearing some clutch noise or your clutch feels soft or slips, give the Shell Rotella T a try.   Personally I use 15-50 bellray due to price points and write offs I can get for a drum Shrug"
supermoto,3cisbp,RyanTally,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"A big supermoto is the dream I think. I find the 450 to be pretty tiny, both in regards to actual height and displacement compared to myself, and would love to have a bigger bike like a 625 or a 690. I'm 6""9 and 330lb with gear on. My cousin recent had a stroke kit and complete tune of his 625 lc4 up to 92.5hp and my god I would kill to have that sort of power, especially in a supermoto bike. Unfortunately I am restricted to bout 600 and under (Australia) till about Feb2016. Was originally October of this year, but I ended up losing my licence for 3 months  which was the reason for this build, to kill time, and my wallet apparently. No regrets though"

supermoto,3c22cs,vanillagueriller,3,Sat Jul 4 01:12:55 2015 UTC,"The swingarm off of an 05 EXC and an 05 SMR are exactly the same. The 450SMR came with a 5"" rear wheel and a 160 tire fits no problem at all, but you will get some tire rub and chain slap(some are a little wider/different shape than others). This is no big deal and to be expected, just run a skinny non o-ring chain. There is absolutely no need at all to file anything!!. The wheel is a bitch to remove and re-install the first few times until you get the technique down.   You can safely even run the rear wheel with the axle blocks flipped to the short side for a shorter wheelbase, at least with a 160/50.   Stop filing stuff and take your time."
supermoto,3c22cs,BickNlinko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:14:38 2015 UTC,Some people just let the chain chew up the tire. As long as it doesn't hit the rim there is no harm is shaving the tire 1/8 an inch.

supermoto,3bykwg,Swiss_Army_Penis,2,Fri Jul 3 09:35:49 2015 UTC,I may pick one up for my wr450 now that you say that. I freak out at long lights watching my temp gauge on my trail tech just skyrocket.
supermoto,3bykwg,Towelie62,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:58:43 2015 UTC,I would. I got this kit and it seems like it moves a lot of air. I don't have a temp gauge on my bike and the overflow tube runs under the bike so I never even noticed it overheating till it was too late :( and it only took about 5 minutes on a really hot day. Toasted the entire engine.
supermoto,3bykwg,Swiss_Army_Penis,2,Fri Jul 3 17:40:06 2015 UTC,I feel like I could just wire a couple old PC case fans to the headlight power cord and save $120 bucks.
supermoto,3bykwg,Towelie62,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:20:08 2015 UTC,You probably could. I couldn't though as my wr426 doesn't put out enough power for add-ons like that. I'd definitely go that route if you can though. Like put em on a switch or something.
supermoto,3bykwg,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:55:21 2015 UTC,I have been debating doing this too. My bike has an upgraded radiator in both shrouds as opposed to the original single sided shroud so I dint think I need a terribly powerful fan.

supermoto,3bwedi,Isoletta,3,Thu Jul 2 23:18:08 2015 UTC,What mods did you do to get the 70hp? I've got the regular 640sm and couldn't come anywhere near that.
supermoto,3bwedi,ratatooie,3,Thu Jul 2 19:43:24 2015 UTC,"Tbh I don't have any proof on it having 70hp, it comes with 65hp on the engine from the factory.  I have owned another 660 with minor mod's (powerblade and slip-on) and that one made close to 60hp on the wheel, this one has the complete Akrapovic titanium system, the camshaft of the 660 rally(longer opening time) and then the pretty standard airfilter-box and sas-removal mod's.  And with this one being well faster than my previous 60 wheel-hp 660 i don't think it's far off for this to have a good 70hp on the engine :)  But it would be nice to get it on the dyno some day, the ""powerband"" is so much different with this setup than my old one, this one has power all the way to the limiter, i haven't ridden a lc4 like that before this one."
supermoto,3bwedi,Edukait,2,Thu Jul 2 20:16:04 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thanks for letting us know.  Have you tried a SMC690 by any chance?

That is due to our ridiculous taxes on vehicles.  A new 690 SMC is around $23.000 -.-  I picked up my 660 in sweden for ~$4000, then i had to pay ~$3400 for the license-plate.........."

supermoto,3bwedi,ratatooie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"I thought it took more than that for 70 hp to the ground. I want to say at lc4 with the basic mods, jetting, airbox etc will do about 57 or so.  Will a system and cam add 13hp? I would guess it would need head work and also more compression to hit 70."
supermoto,3bwedi,Edukait,2,Fri Jul 3 04:34:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah agreed. From my research, it would be seriously difficult (read: expensive) to get the magical 70hp and even then the 660 is an aging bike with some of the ponies more than likely escaping through the years.   I have done all the usual mods to the 640 barring an FCR carb or engine work and I'd be shocked if I ever saw anything over mid 50hp (although I have a new engine to put in so who knows)."
supermoto,3bwedi,Irish-king,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:44:10 2015 UTC,"Well if you are talking 70whp then i can assure you that it hasn't got that much power :D  My guess would be 62-64whp.   As i wrote earlier i don't think a good 70hp on the engine is in any way unrealistic, even with some of them escaping with the bikes age.  it comes with 65 from the factory.."

I run them on my drz400 at 24psi front and 26psi rear and they stick like glue and wear evenly on the street. Though they have rolled over on the edges slightly. 40psi rear would be like riding on a rock and slide all over the place.

Maybe my tire mechanic is full of shit about the rear's pressure, I haven't even checked it since a new one was put on a couple weeks ago. What size rims have you got? I've got 17 front and rear and the rear is 160/60, it's friggin huge.  edit: My complaint about the street disadvantage comes from when I rear-ended a lady who slammed on her brakes at a yellow because the rear broke loose. I just think they're terrible when it comes to emergency braking, and I've tested that theory many times."

(they do a medium compound on these tyres too but the 160/60 should also be a supersoft.)  still seems over inflated for the 660 they are not thattt heavy. Also an overinflated tyre would lose traction easier under heavy breaking due to a smaller contact patch.   I personally loved them, the only tyre I could pop the clutch for wheelies in the rain and wet without the rear spinning up."

So far though, I can tell I like them a lot better than the Contiforce SMs I had on there - and it's not like I disliked those. One of the main reasons I went with the Pirellis is because I needed a 150 rear, and there weren't a whole lot of decent options, especially in dual/multi compound."
supermoto,3blrlf,Karburize,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"Bitchin tires. More than plenty of grip even at higher pressures. Dead neutral handling on sportsbikes which makes for very nice turn in on flickable supermotos. Great hard braking stability and feel awesome doing stoppies even towards the end of their life. Great feed back deep in a lean (although not as good as their higher tier tires), and stability on hard corner exits. You can smoke em and they push and slide very predictably.  It might be indicative of pirellis, but they dont ever really feel horrible at the end of their life. Reasonably priced for what you get."

The need for a 125 in the USA is really not there since you can get a suzuki hayabusa when you are 16 if you want. It sux that you cant get the 125s but instead you can ride any bike you want a LOT earlier...

Starts easily every day - considering it is my only means of transport for my daily 10km ride to work which involves a few traffic lights, a bit of 100km/h motorway, and a lot of filtering/lane splitting."

All the power mods you have done to the DRZ will be a drop in the ocean to the power of the ktm. With increased power comes maintenance costs. Oil more regular changing. Owning a 04 450exc and 450sx, its worth every cent of oil changes. The exc has about 150hrs with no engine work done at all."
supermoto,3bfsrp,nutidizen,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:09:13 2015 UTC,I just want something a little more fun to be honest. Kind of sick of the DRZ and just want the change. Also craving a 6th gear due to sitting at 6000+rpms on the motorway every day and then struggling to keep up with sport bikes on the straights quite badly.
supermoto,3bfsrp,nutidizen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"Your DRZ was basically identical to mine so I sympathise with the desire for 6th gear and the lack of power feeling etc. The Keihin FCR will keep you happy for a bit, but you aren't really going to get a fire breathing monster unless you do engine work (and even then...). That's just the nature of that bike.   That said, I'd stick with it if you want to commute or any form of reliability.  The 525 isn't unreliable per say, more that it isn't anywhere near as reliable or maintenance light as the DRZ. Performance is night and day better than the DRZ, but then that's obvious and you will pay for it in wrenching fees or the like.   My mate had an SMR 525 which was the balls and absolutely incredible to ride but the engine was out the frame twice in 4 months for work (and otherwise so often that we became really good at getting it out and back in). Oil changes were like every 500 miles.   Basically I'm saying you would be mad to commute on it. Especially with that mileage you are looking at a full rebuild off the bat assuming it hasn't been done already (not cheap).   Why not get the newer 690 SMC? That gives you everything you want. Even the older 640s are great fun!"

Oil changes were like every 500 miles.    Although both the 525SMR/SX and the 525EXC have the RFS engines, they are different. The EXC is much less high strung and requires less maintenance. Also the 2004 and 2005 SMR and SX bikes had titanium valves with bronze valve guides, which was a problem after about 50 or so hours(the valves would eat the guides and then the head). The EXC also has a different head, crank, cam, runs less compression etc.   OP, get the 525EXC(if it's in good shape and has been maintained properly). It's an awesome bike and will be way more fun than your DRZ."

supermoto,3bc18x,Towelie62,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:14:58 2015 UTC,Was my first event actually and I was pretty surprised by how many of us there were. There was probably 25 of us if not more at one point. EDIT - Hell we had 7 wr450's alone.
supermoto,3bc18x,TightestOfButtholess,2,Mon Jun 29 11:24:17 2015 UTC,Damn. I'll have to get my DRZ up there sometime and ride with everyone. Sounds like a blast
supermoto,3bc18x,c0ldwolf31,2,Tue Jun 30 02:59:58 2015 UTC,Nice! What tires are those?
supermoto,3bc18x,TightestOfButtholess,2,Sat Jun 27 22:30:10 2015 UTC,Bridgestone battlax bt045 on the rear and stock front tire
supermoto,3bc18x,erode,2,Sun Jun 28 01:31:52 2015 UTC,Really nice bike! Might grab a Yamaha when I upgrade from my Suzuki. What mirrors do you have there?
supermoto,3bcfnk,HeroinHorse,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:09:48 2015 UTC,They're never complete
supermoto,3bbvsa,ImnoArsonist,6,Sat Jun 27 19:08:59 2015 UTC,It would be so fun to have a skill set like these guys. Unbelievable how fast they are.
supermoto,3bbvsa,ApexIsGangster,2,Sat Jun 27 19:26:03 2015 UTC,That was some incredible riding.
supermoto,3baeiv,Jedixscum,3,Sat Jun 27 08:43:59 2015 UTC,So I went throught this. Let me tell you what I did. After research and calling and this and that my bike which had a title that stated it was not able to be registered off road only. Are you ready for this..... I just went to the DMV and said I needed plates they just did it. This is after I was told on the phone no they wouldn't. Hell the VIN wouldn't even go through so they just kinda made it work.  If they dont go to a different one sometimes they just dont give a hot damn it doesnt bother them either way. I am located in Nashville also. Worst case do the SD method
supermoto,3baeiv,cannon85,2,Wed Jul 1 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"http://www.supermotojunkie.com/showthread.php?t=144432  On the first page their are instructions on how to get a plate through South Dakota on any bike over 200cc.  Follow the directions exactly how they are laid out and you can have a plate in a month.    Yes it works, I run a SD plate on my YZ450, and two people I know personally who just got plates on their 2T YZ250's.  You can either run the SD plate or you can transfer the title and plate to WV, it is your choice. Every year SD will send you a tag renewal bill, mine was $26 and they send you a new sticker for your plate.  I have had mine for 2 years now.    The reason you can run the SD plate is, unlike other methods , SD takes your current address information and puts it on the new title and registration.  So whatever your address is now is what will be on the SD tag, title, and registration.  It does not fall under the same rules as an out of state plate."
supermoto,3baeiv,Ridethepig101,2,Sat Jun 27 12:33:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info man. I appreciate it! The only other thing I would need would be street rims/tires and a street legal kit right?
supermoto,3baeiv,Ridethepig101,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"For the SD method, you just have to say it has all that stuff.  My friend got his YZ250 street legal and it is his MX bike.  No lights, no horn, nothing."

supermoto,3b7ow3,Throwaway016232,13,Fri Jun 26 17:12:08 2015 UTC,You're comparing apples to door hinges
supermoto,3b7ow3,eurofra1d,2,Fri Jun 26 18:50:15 2015 UTC,Ha! It's true. But what if that door hinge is half the price?
supermoto,3b7ow3,RXrenesis8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"The DR is a bit high. Probably worth 2k if its immaculate. The WR seems high to me, but I haven't priced them recently.  The DR will need suspension work if you want to hit single-track or any jumps over a couple feet with it."
supermoto,3b7ow3,BudDePo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the heads up. I really don't want to have a bike that's going to be in the shop a lot, since the riding season here is 5 months. I'm only making sure I give all my options a fair shot, despite the fact that I'm 95% set on the WR haha, thanks!"
supermoto,3b7ow3,scuba7183,3,Sat Jun 27 14:40:22 2015 UTC,"Only you can make the decision between the two.  But as far as value goes.  The DR is worth about half of what they are asking.  It's not basically brand new, it's 14 years old."
supermoto,3b7ow3,BudDePo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:46:36 2015 UTC,Those DRs hold on to their value at an annoying rate. I'm trying to buy one for DS/ adv riding in Colorado and 3500 with some farkles would be a decent price
supermoto,3b7ow3,Dougasaurus_Rex,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it depends on the area.  Regardless, its still not worth that price IMO, you'd be better off looking for a more reasonable priced bike for that age."
supermoto,3b7ow3,AGuyWithABrokenPC,3,Sat Jun 27 01:55:47 2015 UTC,Do you want a pickup truck or a sports car?
supermoto,3b7ow3,AGuyWithABrokenPC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:36:40 2015 UTC,Sports car for sure... DR does look quick clunky.
supermoto,3b5rl6,Karlen89,2,Fri Jun 26 04:56:55 2015 UTC,"Aw you totally had it!   Also I think your definition of a ""little"" bit of air would break my DR650 in half."

supermoto,3b5672,bug20k1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way when I first started going off road.  I think it's more fun to start on the street and then discover the freedom of the dirt, as opposed to dirt riders that then buy sport bikes.  I like the increase in challenge, and the lack of cars/laws."
supermoto,3b5672,durandal59,2,Fri Jun 26 08:12:59 2015 UTC,I kinda view street riding like dirt - except now the obstacles move and have a tendency to actively try to kill you.   Sort of like the ultimate game of frogger.
supermoto,3b5672,SumoSect,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:17:25 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Lol.  What mirrors are those by the way? Do you like them?
supermoto,3b5672,SumoSect,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:22:46 2015 UTC,"I think they're the stock ones, they're good when you're at a stop. Other than that they vibrate so damn much.  I can see better out the mirrors on my harley."

supermoto,3aw8s2,Glockamolee,3,Wed Jun 24 00:58:53 2015 UTC,"I do my own, but I struggle every time.  I recommend getting some Motion Pro motorcycle-specific tire irons.  If you use large car ones you will pinch flat your tubes.  Don't bother with a wheel stand, just set some wood down on the ground and work with the rim on that.  Since you are just replacing the tube, you don't need to take off the whole tire, which will make things way easier.  I have 2 4x4's that I set the rim on so I don't damage the brake rotor.  I use baby powder on the tube, and simple green on the tire bead to lubricate it.  Without good lubrication on the bead you will probably damage the tire some trying to put it on.  Other than that, be patient (again, I've done it a few times and still struggle through the process), watch youtube vids, and take small bites when moving the tire on and off the rim.  Forgot to add: I use a Harbor Freight Bead Breaker to get it started.  You will need to do something to get the tire unseated off of the bead.  After the bead is broken, then you can start using the tire irons.  Good luck!"
supermoto,3aw8s2,Yawn_Rape,2,Wed Jun 24 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, hunt around for SMALL TIME motorbike wheel people in your local area, or maybe call a car tyre place. I found a roadside shop that did a full new tube and fitting and balancing for $40 and I cannot go wrong. Went back a 2nd time when I was down to the threads and they gave me an almost brand new pirelli angel gt front with about 90% tread, then fitted it and balanced the wheel for 50 fucking bucks. I was in disbelief. Threw $100 into their new fundraiser to open a new shop about 200km away, you really find a gem every now and again, and in this case I was more than happy to invest."

supermoto,3aw8s2,CharlesFrancisX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:21:59 2015 UTC,"The real trick is to break the bead easily. It can be done with just spoons and a block but it's a pain and takes quite a bit of time/effort. With a bit of trial and error, you'll get it. You can patch your tubes with plain ole bicycle tube patches.    FYI: you will probably mark up your wheels pretty badly."

I put the wheel back on but as I push the bike around slowly it is squeaky.  Like the speedo is rubbing?  I torqued the axle to 23 lbs but the wheel wasn't very free to spin.  So I backed the axle nut up a bit...  is this normal?

Eventually it would only start after putting it in first and letting go of the clutch while rolling it backwards.  It seemed to find its place and start every now and then, but eventually stopped all together.  I pulled the starter thinking I needed to look at replacing it and found it was FILLED with metal dust on the magnets. (Or magnetized brushes or whatever.)  I cleaned it out real well and put it back together and have not had an issue with it starting since.  If it's an older bike, take the starter out and check for this dust.  (After you've exhausted all the easy options of course.)"

supermoto,3avotu,eurofra1d,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no spinning at all. It works 95% of the time. I think it's a loose starter switch/kill switch, ive already had a mirror vibrate loose on that side, maybe the handle bar is a bit loose and vibrates too much. But I'll check this weekend. Seems like a simple issue to fix.   Ill post the answer when I find it here for other people to see."
supermoto,3avotu,eurofra1d,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"Your problem is most likely either the clutch interlock (not as likely but possible) or the kill switch assembly (a lot more likely, my money's on this).

supermoto,3arn7k,ragemonkey1998,8,Mon Jun 22 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"Dude, I was in the same boat. Look up the weights, the 500 EXC is 260lbs, and the 690 is 300lbs. I'm sure you can handle the extra 40lbs. The deciding factor for me was the oil change intervals with 500 miles the EXC and 2,000 miles for the 690 R. So I got a 690 and I haven't looked back.

supermoto,3arn7k,Jeff505,3,Tue Jun 23 02:09:23 2015 UTC,500exc is a dirt bike and will be much much much better offroad. Really depends on how often you want to be in the dirt. If you're not in the dirt every weekend and aren't doing sumo track days get the 690. A much better road bike and longer maintenance intervals.

Would say being tall is a bit of an advantage to being short, as we can generally throw the bikes around a little more, and kickstarting and flatfooting over the bike is no problem at all. Would love to see a photo of you on the bike if you have one, I don't really have one except for a quick bounce wheelie I did here, but would be cool to see another big rider and your relation to the bike"

Cost me $770 and they re-did my bearings in my rear shock an swing arm included in that. I live in Australia though, so not sure if they would have MPE or a similar equivalent whereever you are, but I would highly recommend getting it done. When I first bought the bike, it had a suspension set up for a tiny little 65kg | 140lb guy and I could already see he had kept the exhaust in the same place with the big rear tyre and had cracked the muffled with the side of the wheel during a bottom out. Went for a ride when I got home and it handled like a fat little jetski, so booked a suspension change the very next day and haven't looked back since. Also run enhanced suspension on both my wr450's and I can certainly say that makes a huge difference."

The 690 feel every bit as powerful and light as a 700cc dirtbike should.  The question is can you live without the better frame/subframe for attaching luggage to.  That is where the 690 is better than the 500cc, for travel.   For just riding trails and not camping off the bike, I'd go 500cc.

If the goal is to have something you can do dirt on as well, how crazy is the dirt you ride?  I know if it was going to be my main bike, I would get the 690 hands down.  I ride the 500 a bit on the street, but shy away from long rides, or where I know I have to drone on the highway long periods.  If it's over an hour away, I'll throw it on a hitch carrier and go.  A 690R I would just ride.  The 690 also has ABS when you're on the street, which is a good thing.  I've seen plenty of people taking them on tough routes, though admittedly, a 500 is going to be more fun on some single track.  That all said, I do love my 500.  I would like both.  It would be interesting to have a 690 for a few weeks and spend some time riding it on my regular trails, and seeing which one I liked more."
supermoto,3arn7k,HoneyBadgerRy,2,Tue Jun 23 01:58:28 2015 UTC,I decided on a 690 over the 500 because of the more road worthiness.  I heard the 500 gets blown around on the highways pretty bad.  Really happy with my 690.

supermoto,3ar7bo,Soulshott,2,Mon Jun 22 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"In my experience (and I'm in my 60's) you won't be happy with ""second best"". At first you will, of course, but you'll eventually look on it as money wasted as the value decreases over time. If you're sure you can handle payments and can get a low interest rate, that might be your best long-term choice - but only you can make that decision.  I looked for months for a good used supermoto, then started looking for a new DRZ-SM and couldn't find one after I let the first one I found get away from me while I was making up my mind. When the next one hit the dealer I snatched it up, and two years later it's still one of my favorite bikes of all I've owned. The thing about the DRZ is that there are so many aftermarket items for it; I scored a ready-made ""hop-up kit"" from a guy who was putting his back stock to sell. I got an FCR carb, ""E"" cams and an MRD/SSW exhaust system in like-new condition for little more than just the carb would have cost new. Those parts plus a 3x3 airbox mod and a few bucks spent getting a pro carb tuner to dial it in using a dyno changed the whole nature of it for the better, and I had no complaints beforehand.  I'm sure there are better SMs out there, but for cost, reliability and ease of upgrades the old DRZ is hard to beat, and they hold their value well."

I did some more broad searches of places like a few states over (california) and ive already found at least 3 DR-Z's around my price range that would be super awesome. Just have to convince the wife into ""traveling that far for just a dirtbike"" haha ill turn it into a trip with her and the daughter :P  In the end ill probably pony up and get a great DR-Z, cant beat the reliability and fucntionality of them. sure they could be a little bit lighter but who cares! its a DR-Z! thanks for the input, i really appreciate it :) Keep the shiny side up!

supermoto,3aprq2,kushmonger,0,Tue Jun 23 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"Displacement of a piston engine is the measurement of how much fluid an engine displaces with all cylinders at bottom dead center--this is at 1 atmosphere or pressure.  With forced induction, you're forcing more fluid into the engine than it could possibly displace at 1 atmosphere, thus you increase t he amount of fluid it displaces.  I don't see what the difficult part of that is to understand...it's also the reason why most racing leagues give a multiplier to forced induction cars for displacement rules (i.e. turbo car calculates at 1.4* standard displacement for league racing)"
supermoto,3aprq2,The__RIAA,2,Tue Jun 23 15:28:59 2015 UTC,I understand forced induction. The displacement of a cylinder is measured as follows: displacement = pi/4 x bored squared x stroke x number of cylinders    Where in that equation do you see pressure?
supermoto,3aprq2,vanillagueriller,0,Tue Jun 23 17:55:15 2015 UTC,it's implied as a fluid pump...unless you're telling me a naturally aspired engine can contain more fluid than one under boost with the same dimensions. The displacement of a motor is meaningless without taking the intake into account.

supermoto,3aprq2,BathtubSnorkeler,2,Tue Jun 23 14:40:20 2015 UTC,"Reliability is about the same, I would say as the 250. I have two at the moment, an 05 and an 07 both set up for enduro with bar risers and long range tanks. Both are very reliable bikes, although I would say with confidence that the 05 is leagues ahead of the 07 which is bit surprising, just in reliability, acceleration and general responsiveness. Bought both at about 3000kms/1800miles and they are both about another 3000kms on top of that now, and all I have done is oil filters and oil change and cleaned the air filter and plugs and things after it dissapeared into a lake. Pretty happy with both bikes, although they are very slow for any open tracks or road use. Both bikes are starting to scream in 5th gear at 80km/50mi per hour, which is quite slow. my 450 exc has no trouble getting to 120km/75mi per hour and sitting there in 6th. Bought both bikes road registered as well, with fender eliminators and the whole roa set up, which is how they come in Aus"

These bikes have a tendency to eat right through the chain slider on the swingarm, and into the arm itself. Get a 14 tooth counter sprocket to space the chain off the slider, and then do whatever you want with the rear. Personally I find 14/50 to be perfect. For 14/50 I used a 114 link chain, adjust up or down a few links depending on what you choose for your rear. Also be careful keep the chain precisely in adjustment.

supermoto,3ansjs,-mr-tibbs-,5,Mon Jun 22 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"Generally sumos aren't built for those highway speeds. But IMO you should just pick what bike you like best and play with the gearing. I run 15/39 on my drz and cruise pretty comfortably at 70-75, but you can go farther with the sprockets (Drz is only 5 speed which doesn't help). Just understand that you will be losing a significant amount of bottom end (aka wheelie power) from doing this.   www.gearingcommander.com is an excellent resource"
supermoto,3ansjs,Motocid,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"Was just about to ask about how you found that power. I run 15/45 on my 450exc sumo and I find even that is a little lacking. I ended up chucking the original dirt bike 50 tooth on the rear and had no troubles at all and enjoyed it a lot more. Found that as a 6 speed, I was cruising at 95km/60mi per hour in 5th and 115km/72mi per hour in 6th which was not a very comfortable set up considering an average Australian highway speed of 100km/63mi per hour. The 50 was maybe slighter under, so when I bought new sprockets recently, just settled on a 15/47 ratio."

supermoto,3ansjs,eurofra1d,2,Mon Jun 22 12:34:09 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify a few things. These are dirtbikes with street wheels. The aerodynamics, seating position and the whole bike in general are not made to run at highway speeds. Almost all sumo's can run at highway speeds but they lack the power and seating position to make it comfortable. My Sumo experience is with a DRZ400. In stock form, it'll do 85 but it'll take a bit to get there. And you really don't have much throttle left for passing. With a pipe and FCR carb, 85 is much quicker to get to but again, not much left to pass (compared to a 600cc sport bike). You can't downshift at that speed, it'll redline. DRZ only has 5 gears. Stock gearing gives the best top speed vs RPM's. Changing the gearing just messes with your city riding. Top speed suffers regardless of what you do. Short story: These are dirtbikes. If you need to do 85, the DRZ can do it but there isn't much left. Top speed is 90."

FZ is cheap new but there aren't many used ones. Also heard something about ABS being required in EU 2016. Anyway, your thoughts? Also FZ is better for a highway while you can take the supermoto offroad. Not sure how often I would go on a highway.."
supermoto,3ageyt,jawknee21,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:35:55 2015 UTC,i really felt like I learned on my supermoto. the fz09 is fun but its heavy and way more powerful than my sm. still takes getting used to but the sm has actually usable power. it feels like its way faster than it is and the weight makes a big difference. and if you're still learning the supermoto is WAY cheaper to drop or crash. I bumped something (car) with my sliders on my fz09. Didnt even drop the bike and i had to replace the bolts in my sliders. its over 100lbs heavier than a heavy supermoto (DRZ) and the fz09 isnt that heavy to begin with. the fz07 is a little more manageable but its only like 15 lbs lighter than the 09...

(Beringer Importer) The MC might have a tad to small of a hydraulic ratio, it might be the 12mm, but the guy I bought it from didn't know. I would personally like the 13mm more if that is the case. I am still using whatever pads I got with them. I have done a Brembo 4 piston caliper on Braking rotors with a Beringer MC before on a Honda 450R. I feel that when you use a braking system designed as a package it is better than piecing stuff together. Just keep your eyes peeled for used Beringer packages on SMJ."

supermoto,39znb0,thumpin,4,Tue Jun 16 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"I had an 04 625SMC, which is the supermoto version of the SXC. The difference is the swing arm(wider on the SMC), suspension(same forks and shocks just sprung different) and the brakes(SMC has a bigger 4 piston Brembo caliper, bigger master and larger rotor), and the FCR carb(pretty sure the SXC has the Mikuni BST).   I loved my 625 and would absolutely buy another one. Mine had around 16k onn it when I sold it and the only issue I had with it was the head cracked because the PO ran it without enough coolant and overheated it. The oil changes are a bit of a bitch also. You can hop it up with very little money if the bike has the FCR carb (JD ket kit, airbox mod and remove the pea shooter from the can).  With that said that guys price looklooks a bit high, even with the low mileage and inclusion of the dirt wheels. I would ask him what size the rear wheel is and what brake setup is on the bike. The SMC came with a 5"" rear wheel which I don't know if that will fit on the SXC swing arm.  Google the 2004 625SMC and look at the brakes , the caliper should be gold and quite a but bigger than the silver dirt bike version."
supermoto,39znb0,BickNlinko,2,Tue Jun 16 05:31:36 2015 UTC,"Just to back OP up here, and might even be a good idea to include this in an edit /u/BickNlinko , This is the 2004 SMC front caliper, in stark comparison to This, being the sxc front caliper and I believe the caliper that is used on all the exc models as well. From the looks of things, the seller is running the smaller brembo sxc caliper rather than the larger ktm supermoto one. That being said, I have ridden with both supermoto and stock calipers on a 320mm disc and this really shouldn't make a significant difference unless you are racing track."

Butttttt I can put in my 2 cents I have had 2 drzs and my current husky 610. They are both some of the most reliable supermotos you can get.  The ktms and Aprilias are all going to  have stricter maintenance but going to have a lot of power and a really fun bikes. Buy it and break it then fix it and learn a thing or two.
supermoto,39znb0,ratatooie,3,Tue Jun 16 02:58:37 2015 UTC,"Also it's not fuel injected, which sucks especially because it's a KTM.    None of the older LC4s were fuel injected. Why would it being a KTM mean having a carb sucks?   The guy says it has a jet kit which means he's tinkered around with the carbs, not something I'm a big fan of in terms of reliability, but that's just me.   I'm not sure if you are joking, but why would re jetting the carb affect reliability? It's a great, cheap, easy way to get the bike to run properly for your altitude and set up (such as if you open up the airbox or get aftermarket pipes) A lot of bikes come not particularly well set up from the factory due to (among other things) emissions regulations too."

Plus its tiled.  The text is pretty clean, the javascript on it is great, with all of the transitioning photos. the SM wheel customiser looks great, the app itself. but everything else minus the produc description pictures looks terrible. the quanity box is just a white box with a 1 in it. i had no idea what it was at first. the whole flow underneath the applet is bad :/   Also the links within the menu's on the left side look weird imo with the dotted line below them. They could have gone with something more clean. Overall its a pretty decent looking website with nice picture transition and a wheel builder is very crisp and loads rather quick compared to what i was expecting for it. Overall i rate it a  generous 6/10  Im a beginner webdesigner so this was just my take on it ha"

supermoto,39t0hb,Emberblade2,2,Sun Jun 14 18:35:20 2015 UTC,"That is going to be some kind of monster on the streets.  What sprockets are you running?  Get the jet kit from mikuni, that way you can at least change them out and try different sizes until it works  perfectly for you.  Normally jetting is pretty straightforward, and the kit has instructions.  Im not sure how the big bore kit would affect that honestly.    As far as the airbox, I would keep it stock, unless you're really set on pods for the look.  I went pods on my xr, and it was difficult to get the jets just right.  I switched to a high flow uni filter and put a few small holes in the side cover to help it breathe while still keeping things clean.  Try over at thumpertalk if you have more involved questions, this sub isnt that big yet."

I will get back to you on that after I go count. haha I bought this thing in pieces from a guy on CL and it was just bolts and parts in boxes. Got the tech manual and been doing some powder coating, painting, and assembly to get it to where it is now. The airbox seems to be the way to go from what I gather."
supermoto,39t0hb,Mild_humor,2,Sun Jun 14 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"Well you've been doing a great job, it looks like jewelry!  Most people opt for the 15 tooth (+1 over the stock 14) front with a 46 rear, especially if you're doing highway riding.  A stock xr is pretty unstable at 75+, so keep that in mind.  I always have to lean over the front forks when I get on the highway or else it gets horribly shaky.  If you're keeping the stock forks, consider a scotts steering damper to compensate for the speed wobble.  If you do more wheelies than highway riding, you wont need to worry about it, and a damper is an accessory you wont need.  Also know that the adjustments on the bottom of the forks work miracles to stiffen up the suspension.   These are fantastic bikes, I've had 3 of them so far, and they're the easiest motorcycles in the world.  Keep the valves and chain adjusted right and it will thump until the sun explodes."
supermoto,39t0hb,noeatnosleep,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:57:03 2015 UTC,"Awesome feedback and thanks! So, I have yet to consider an upgraded fork setup but he forks have been rebuilt and new ATF fluid has been installed to MAX stiffness specs per factory specs in the manual by a close hydraulic buddy of mine. I am hoping the forks will be okay for now. As far as highway speeds, I will do generally LESS driving 75 plus and more of back road winding and the like. I honestly think from my memory I have a 14/46 setup currently but not sure   offhand."
supermoto,39t0hb,Jeff505,2,Sun Jun 14 23:10:50 2015 UTC,"If the forks were rebuilt, then keep them.  A lot of people swap them for late model crf forks, but I personally think theres nothing wrong with the stock forks rebuilt and torqued up.  If they're revalved, they'll do the job just fine.  If not, it's just something to do in the future."

I'd advise buying used if it's your first bike, you can always upgrade later without losing a lot of money.  Fortunately dirt bike parts are cheap and widely available.

Not sure if you ride already but if you buy new and lay it down you'll beat yourself up over it. Plus modifications and whatnot and your bike will depreciate rapidly when new. Just save the cash buying used and spend it on mods! You may end up having a newfound dream bike later, and then you'll know it's the one, and buy new being more experienced and with more knowledge on exactly what you want.

I love my bike and it's perfect for me in this stage of riding (first time rider/city commuter still learning the basics and still on my L plates) but if you know how to ride a motorcycle or have plans to pop wheelies given the chance, this bike just isn't the bike. After all my mods, and I have a lot, it still only produces around 23hp max.. something to think about. And if you plan on converting it to supermoto, that's around $900 for the wheels plus the Stage 1 FMF or Yoshi/EJK upgrade which is an easy $1000.  Upgrades are a must if you want to get anything out of this bike, stock it's really quite underwhelming.

supermoto,39gqq1,vanillagueriller,2,Fri Jun 12 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"Might be worth checking out TORPEDO7 wheels. They are Australian I do believe, however they give you a red anodized hub, black rims and silver spokes, which isn't far off what you are looking for. The set I linked too also have a cush drive so it will be  smooth ride and you will save your gearbox a bit. Also with the currency conversion, should only be about $650usd. Might be worth atleast having a look at. Also its a great idea to paint everything black. Just bought an almost entirely black graphics kit for my KTM supermoto, as well as coasting a few little engine pieces with high heat matte black as well. Looks really really nice, especially with the full black riding gear.  http://www.torpedo7.com.au/products/T7WHSNNSC/title/torpedo7-supermoto-cnc-wheel-set-cush-drive"

In regards to the licence, I am actually ashamed that I somehow managed to lose it in my shitty commuter car, rather than the bike. I have had a lot of close calls with cops though on the bike, especially 2 occasions of accidentally passing cops at 160km/h(100mph) in a 100km/h(65mph) zone. Somehow neither time they even pursued me or chased me or anything. I even pulled over to accept the long dick of the law, but nothing ever happened so I guess I got off lucky."

Completely different story, I ripped down the highway doing a bit over 150 and just as you said, I passed a cop and they just did not follow (maybe due to speed?).

I have only owned this bike as far as four strokes go.   Just a note ...I'd obviously make sure you can register it before buying it. Mine had the title converted for street use in Vermont.

I remember reading an ama about burglars and they recommend getting a real or fake cc camera. Pros will not touch it if there is a chance of a camera being on them. Also apparently only new criminals lift it into a van due to it being an easy way of getting caught. So chain it to a solid steel post and cover it and you should be fine.

supermoto,390cg6,Marbro_za,3,Mon Jun 8 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm going to bet it's a clutch issue.  Gearbox issues usually manifest in the lower gears, especially 2nd gear for who knows what reason.  When my clutch slipped on my bike, it was usually on the highways with a lot of wind resistance. At a certain point there is not enough clutch friction to overcome the wind pushing on you and it'll start slipping. Might just have to tighten it, worst case scenario, spend a few bucks on an oil change and new friction plates."

supermoto,390cg6,Vital_Cobra,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"the reason is because there's a lot more force on the lower gears than the higher gears. somone in the industry told me that on a car, first gear is designed to withstand 30 mins of constant max rpm before failing."
supermoto,390cg6,legendarydave,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:49 2015 UTC,Best way to find out if the clutch is toast is just go up a gear higher than you'd usually use and go WOT.  If the revs climb and the speed doesn't follow it's on it's way out.  Can it cruise at 4-5k RPMs in every other gear without issue?
supermoto,38x8e9,AlterJosh,4,Sun Jun 7 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Buying brand new is a waste of money, it depreciates very quickly. It does, however, save you from the issues of poor maintenance or broken stuff on used bikes. Plus, you will drop your bike. Dropping new bikes feels shitty. I suggest buying a new bike to someone who is sure they are going to own it long enough to put a LOT of miles/hours on it and keep it maintained. youtube and google can teach you the basics. owners manual / shop manual can get you the specifics for your bike you need to grow and do more complex work. You don't just need to KNOW how to do maintenance, you need the tools, time, and work space as well."

One is a mile away from me but doesn't allow people to test ride bikes before you buy. The other is about three hours away and does. Should I just bite the bullet and buy from the one close to me?"
supermoto,38x8e9,broken_cogwheel,2,Sun Jun 7 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"Go test ride bikes at the far one, buy that bike at the close one...  Most dealerships do not allow test rides for obvious (but annoying) reasons. New riders are a big liability. Mostly BMW/duc/(HD?) dealerships do test rides but not generic dealerships from most of my experience. Unless they have a bunch of test bikes lying around.  If you buy a motorcycle at the far dealership, you can still take it to the close dealership to get work done as long as they are capable. If you buy a ducati, other dealerships may not do the work on them.  If you buy a japanese bike (buy a japanese bike. seriously.) then basically anyone will work on it."

supermoto,38x8e9,buttrapinpirate,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Latching on to what you said here, I came from a bit of a mix on OP's experience, so to instill some confidence in you OP here's my experience with mechanically oriented maintenance growing up:  When I was in high school if anything had to be done on my car, my dad would never let me work on my car or my quad / dirt bike (don't fuck with my tools, don't get oil spots on the garage floor, etc) and I didn't really learn anything. As I went to college and didn't have the budget to just send shit to the dealership (money I made now had to go to real expenses like rent). I was thrown into the fire of having to fix my car and bike. A few YouTube videos, forums, and some lightly informed friends to reassure me changed all of that. I now fix everything myself minus the things I don't have tools for, like pulling the whole engine out.  So point being, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and do some maintenance, especially sumos because they're very simple to fix. It doesn't seem that way at first, but assuming you can read my post and understand me, you can fix it. Sorry for the novel, I just want you to have some confidence that you can do it. I'm very happy that I can now, and I didn't know jack shit before the Internet helped. There are tons of resources.  My only warning is to make sure that you have all of the tools to complete your task before you start! :)"

I've tried all sorts of different combinations of thread sealers, tape, and different washers. To no avail.   Brought it indoors last night and laid her down to see what's going on. Figured I would use blue loctite and let it setup. Taking a look at it, and the case is cracked. A bit of JB weld and 24 hours later and she's back outside and full of oil.

supermoto,38fr1e,Misplaced_Suspicion,3,Wed Jun 3 23:06:43 2015 UTC,Style and breathability. Usually you end up working hard on a supermoto. Either riding hard or pulling it out of some awful mud hole. The open helmet breaths better while still providing full face protection.
supermoto,38fr1e,SuMoto,2,Wed Jun 3 23:06:58 2015 UTC,Street helmets fog out when you are working hard on the bike. Need more airflow.  Adventure and dirtbike helmets like to blow off your head due to the visor at high speed though.

Mileage sucks and premix gets irritating though so bring a mixing bottle (http://www.mx1canada.com/maxima-quick-2-mix-bottle.html) and a litre of Motorex 2T oil.   Change your gearbox oil lots and keep an eye for water getting into it.  Pull fully sick 4th gear wheelies.

It was already plated when I bought it but not exactly street legal (still isn't fully but idc about horn and few other things). I changed out the tip in the exhaust to a more open, less restricted one, did the sumo swap, installed a trail tech vapor, installed a baja key ignition in place of the stock ignition. I had to install a new rear brake switch since the old one wasn't working. I also installed new factory effex shroud/tank/air filter graphics because I'm an aesthetics guy and the previous one's didn't fit right. Also put some mirrors on the underhand side of the handlebars and switched to a shorty clutch lever. That's everything I can think of off the top of my head except for my clutch cable that broke in my driveway this morning so I will have a motionpro clutch cable on Tuesday haha. EDIT - When I bought the bike the owner had a shock for a 220 pound rider I think he said. I only weigh like 180 so I might switch it back to stock."

Are the maintenance intervals as ridiculous as the newer models are? Like oil changes every 24 hours or something like that? I've always wanted to do one up like that but the crazy maintenance intervals have scared me away from using it as something more than a weekend warrior. You planning on taking it to the track?

As far as maintenance goes I enjoy working on my bike, and the oil changes are quick so I do them about once every 400-800 miles. I use Rotella T 15w-40 which is like $12 a gallon so it's all pretty cheap. As far as track riding goes I might go on some group event days or something.

supermoto,383beq,RogerShakenbak,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:02:49 2015 UTC,I did get to ride it for a 2 days and the only thing i noticed is if i started it in 1st with clutch in it would hop forward a bit but only did that a few times.
supermoto,383beq,RogerShakenbak,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:18:19 2015 UTC,"Is the clutch hydraulic?  Edit: Sorry. I looked at the photo more closely. It appears you have a Magura hydraulic clutch lever. It could need to be bled. This could affect the travel of the clutch and cause it to not actuate all the way.   The bike should lurch forward slightly when you kick it into 1st but it should not move. This is exaggerated when the bike is cold. The mechanics may or may not be right about it needing new clutch plates (fouled from wrong oil?). Even if it did turn out to need a clutch, I would have it done somewhere else and deprive them of the money if it turned out they were scamming you."

supermoto,383beq,SuMoto,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:24:11 2015 UTC,Those bikes are notorious for spending a lot of time in the shop/garage. Something probably cratered in the clutch case and isn't allowing the clutch to be pulled or it's the hydraulic clutch master or slave cylinders.
supermoto,383beq,RyanTally,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"Clutch master or slave cylinders? Seems a little drastic, could it just not be the plates?"

A good Ducati owner will keep meticulous records of maintenance, or have a shop with the records.  If this guy doesn't know when he last did belts or valves (those are the two big ones), then I wouldn't touch it.  Are you shopping for a supermoto?  If so, I can't recommend getting a hyper.  The best part about riding a sumo is not caring about what happens to it (obviously to an extent, I ride mine hard but treat it well).  Insurance is incredibly expensive for a Ducati, and yes you will need to keep up with the maintenance.  6 grand will get you a sick sumo, or a higher mileage Ducati, and the two will be good at entirely different things."

I'd change those tires though, see if you can get the BT-090s.  I had the dirt tires as well, they were heavy and made the bike handle like crap.

If it's 39 or 41mm, with a bit of work it'll work nicely on a DRZ400. You will have to take a lot of the extra junk off to make it fit nicely on a DRZ and change all the jets and needle, then machine an intake ring. I bought a second hand carb for my DRZ, I managed to make it work with a little bit of effort.  I wouldn't pay more than $100 for that carb. Unless you can find out exactly what bike it came off of and what it is, you've got a paperweight."

supermoto,37mbxn,ratatooie,2,Thu May 28 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"I believe that's a Keihin FCR non MX carb. It will have a serial number just above the lip of the float bowl. The first few numbers should tell you whether it's a 39 or 41. It's unlikely to be a 37 if it's off a KTM 450. Older but still good!   If the intake has screws on to allow it to be taken off, you are laughing and can fit it to a load of bikes to up the performance.   Frankmx on eBay has everything you could possibly want in terms of cleaning it up and rebuilding it or fitting it to a different bike. Hell, I'd be interested in it if it wasn't in the states!"
supermoto,37mbxn,SuMoto,1 point,Thu May 28 21:39:28 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look like the air filter side is solid and isn't bolted on. It's still usable on a DRZ, you just need to make an adapter."
supermoto,37mbxn,Jeff505,1 point,Fri May 29 04:40:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely a keihin fcr carb, with some sort of air routing attachment on the airbox side, I think it's some sort of snake oil thing that touts to ""improve throttle response"". The carb itself is great. What bike did it come off of? Might help narrow town the model.  edit: It's a ""PowerNow"" carb plate - it's used to increase air pressure at the bottom of bore, which will 'suck' more mixture out of the emulsion tube, making it seem as though you have more power. You don't you just have that sensation, because you don't have to turn the throttle as far."
supermoto,37mbxn,ChumBucket1,1 point,Thu May 28 18:19:25 2015 UTC,It has some custom stuff on the bottom like a milled out piece and a longer know. I'm not sure what bike it came off. It was left behind when someone moved from my a house my brother bought and he gave it to me. I think the guy had a ktm 450  http://imgur.com/V84dPTU
supermoto,37mbxn,BickNlinko,2,Thu May 28 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"Its a Keihn FCR, milled out portion is custom accelerator pump cover. never seen one that big though. Has an adjustable fuel screw also. You need to Mic the diameter of the engine side and see what mm it is."
supermoto,37mbxn,Jeff505,2,Thu May 28 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"That milled piece is an original R&D Power Pump with an adjustable leak jet. They're pretty cool, but not all that useful if your bike already runs well."
supermoto,37mbxn,Jeff505,1 point,Thu May 28 22:33:11 2015 UTC,"Very cool, wonder what that does. I bet if you email keihin they'd tell you what model the carb is at least."

supermoto,37mbxn,radsupermoto,1 point,Thu May 28 18:33:30 2015 UTC,In its current condition more like $100.   Too much unknown about its operating condition.   Edit: also does not seem to have the removable intake bell which severely limits its value.

But to elaborate, even with wide gears and a more highway centric sprocket selection you aren't getting sustained highway speeds out of a 250. Atleast without sacrificing everything you bought it for. Be honest with yourself. Is this going to be a total hoonsicle? Or a commuter with the occasional curb hopping, wheelie romp, off road jaunt? If it's the first than a 250 sounds awesome. The second? 450 all the way. You won't miss a thing."

I have an 02 WR250F that started as an offroad only enduro bike and has slowly been transforming into my budget sumo. She's pretty quick up to 40 or so but gets pretty buzzy past 50.

I think they stopped putting adjustable Marzocchi front forks on them after 2008/2009 ish, not sure.

supermoto,37if3v,RogerShakenbak,1 point,Thu May 28 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"Very rare is the road where the foot out technique is beneficial other than intersections or parking lots.  Unless you're on a tight track designed for supermoto or karts and are backing it in, foot out will only slow you down.  Here's a visual aid (since we're into that sort of thing).When the lead rider starts riding foot out, he's way slower than when he is riding Superbike style and knee out. If your roads are tighter and twistier than Deals Gap then good on ya!"

Did you want a more street oriented tire or a more dirt oriented tire?  30 mph in dirt? It's a street tire in dirt... You could do 55 mph on gravel road, but 30 mph on a dirt trail seems like a decent clip for a street tire. Well if you go balls to the wall, expect to pay the price and tear your equipment up. Not sure how a bulge in the sidewall caused by neglect is the tires fault."

I'm assuming that might get less if your racing on them, but I don't find them squishy in the corner or anything.   http://www.pirelli.com/tire/us/en/motorcycle/sheet/scorpion_mt_90_a-t.html?url=%3Fsubtype%3Doff-road  what kinda bike are you riding?"

supermoto,37hwfl,SuMoto,1 point,Fri May 29 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"You try the cheapo brands. Shinko's are cheap as dirt but do have their limitations. I've personnally ran Shinko 700's, lots of folks run shinko 244's. They are more dirt oriented and will send you on a low-side if you push them on corners. That being said, sliding around corners can be fun with enough practice. They give a satisfyingly deep howl when you mash the rear brake or burn them up a bit. I wouldn't recommend these for hard cornering, more trail oriented tires with some road manners. I currently run Avon's and after 12,000km, the back tire is pretty bald in the middle. The front has another 5 or 6k km before I'll re-tire it. I hate the nervous front end on gravel."

Not the most fun bike to ride on the freeway, that's for sure.  It's a monster. I can easily power wheelie in 3rd and 4th with a tug.

supermoto,378xcr,dochattan,3,Tue May 26 01:07:35 2015 UTC,Well.. a sumo is basically a dirt bike with road tires so to go and then put dirt tires on it is more or less doing a complete 360.
supermoto,378xcr,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Tue May 26 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, i gotcha now. Its more...putting it back to its original state to enjoy it in its natural habitat before converting it back to normal for driving to work :) without having to buy a typically imo much less fun dual sport that is on average not the best in either street or dirt where as the sumo is great on both. with correct tires. in my opinion that is"
supermoto,378xcr,Swiss_Army_Penis,2,Tue May 26 01:18:02 2015 UTC,Most Sumos are dirtbikes or based off a dirtbike so with dirt wheels and tires they'd be almost or exactly the same as a dirtbike. They're typically a little heavier than mx bikes but not too much so unless you were trying to compete I think it'd be fine.  Or you could do what I did and use a true mx bike as a Sumo ;) it works pretty well on a track
supermoto,378xcr,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Mon May 25 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah makes sence :P but the main reason im going with a sumo is for the DD capabilities.. and the fun of them, im not a cruizer or sport bike type.

supermoto,378xcr,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Mon May 25 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Yup sumos are definitely the most fun around town, and I've ridden all types of bikes. If you're just starting out and want a good ""all purpose sumo"" I'd say go with a wr250. They're not super heavy and thus do tracks and stuff a little better than say a drz400. The only downside is they've only got so much power, but the nimblness makes up for it in my opinion. Of course if you're in an area that allows it I'd try for a plated wr450 or something if you're planning in taking it offroad a lot. Just be prepared for the crazy power they've got."
supermoto,378xcr,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Tue May 26 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply and info! Im definately going to be getting my sumo plated. thats square one :) Im more looking towards the future when i can find some time to spare on weekends or something taking it out to the track and having some fun in the dirt. the ""all purpose sumo"" is exactly what i was looking for, something that is better for commuting than a dual sport. and something that could potentially be better for jumps etc on the track in the dirt. and once i found sumo's i fell in love.  Edit: I was originally leaning towards a drz because of the color etc. but ive heard that the wr250/450x has a bit more smooth power and is a bit lighter. that seems better for what im looking for :) At least with the blue(color of the wr) and all my orange/red gear ill definately be noticed!!"
supermoto,378su2,HeroinHorse,5,Mon May 25 20:28:08 2015 UTC,"Well I'll give an answer, but I'll preface with this: I do not own a bike, nor do I do wheelies. With that being said, a wheelie is dependent on balance point and forward momentum. Let's say you wanna do a wheelie and hold it at 30mph. You start your wheelie, get to 30 by going through your gears, and find your balance point you like. You'll then need to keep it on that point with the throttle. You won't just be hammering it, you'll need to be on and off  it. As well as partially on it. I'd assume you're just full throttle once the wheel is off the ground. My two cents, good luck with you."
supermoto,378su2,Nephthysxx,1 point,Mon May 25 20:58:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! And I do just go full throttle but I do give some and eventually have to shift. I must not be at the exact balance point

This DTX and Derbi DRD are more downtuned for street use as in they are less powerful and less stressed out in comparison and so are more made for street use. stuff like that DTX you can ride for longer distances no problem, just avoid highways."
supermoto,371n0h,MARKWEBBER,1 point,Sun May 24 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"So what is it about the race engines that can't handle the highway? If you can ride the piss out on them on the track for a few hours and then take them home and tear em down and do it again the next day why the hell cant you do it on the street? I've seen street legal exc 300's and cr500's, do the owners have to rebuild the engines after every ride?"
supermoto,371n0h,4SWAG20YOU,1 point,Sun May 24 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Well 2 stroke race engines dont really like to sit at the same rpm for longer times, they're made for rapid acceleration and constant gear changing, if you sit at a lower rpm for a while it dirtys up the spark plug and stops running, also since the engine is lubricated with oil mixed in the gas it needs constent revving or change of speed to stay lubricated. also most 2 stroke race engines need alot of regular maintenace if theyre ridden hard, like if you race you're supposed to change your piston every 24 hours of racing or if you're riding light trails and not in high rpm much you should change it every 60 or so hours."

supermoto,36zew4,Supremis,2,Sat May 23 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but these bikes are better setup for a street tracker conversion rather than a sumo.    Without high $ and serious weight reduction, you will have a hard time vetting the performance you want for a sumo setup... Either way, most people who make these as trackers use 17 inch wheels, so you will probably find all the conversion info you need if you do research on it."
supermoto,36zew4,socruisemebabe,2,Sat May 23 14:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'd see if any bike came with 17 inch wheels that share that model of fork. If not, talon hubs are universal and you'd just need to source spacers or have a machine shop create some, not impossible. That or a fork swap might be an option for you. Lots of ways for sure, just varying amounts of money."

supermoto,36xxgq,supernaculum,1 point,Sat May 23 04:29:51 2015 UTC,"Buying used is a risk no matter which way you look at it. Buying a heavily modded bike is extra risky, but if they are mods you want, then go for it.   Honestly with the DRZ, there's a few things that typically get overlooked. Steering stem and swing arm bearings need to be greased every few years or they rust out. Also the front sprocket needs high strength thread locker. If it comes loose, then you're already in trouble."
supermoto,36xxgq,roger_podakter,1 point,Sat May 23 03:37:21 2015 UTC,"I figure the engine mods are a bit of added risk- I'm not especially hard on my bikes though... not really even into wheelies that much even...  Call me a square... just like riding :D - I felt like the DR250 i have is a really solid bike- i just don't like how it feels on the road, the SV is much more planted. It seems like the DRZ400SM (or maybe any SM) would be a good hybrid of the ""high up, upright, nimble"" characteristics of the DR but with some of the low end fun and highway riding abilities of the SV  I've read varying reports that the DRZ won't work on the Highway- I'm not against dropping a few teeth in the back though to tone it down a bit."
supermoto,36xxgq,RyanTally,1 point,Sat May 23 03:50:28 2015 UTC,"Yea. I rode the DRZ on the highway no problem.  Honestly, when I say a modded bike is risky to buy, its mostly because if you wanna turn around and sell, it will take a while.  Do some homework, find out who did the motor work. If it was from a shop, look up their reviews and go talk to them personally about the bike. If they just did the build last winter, they should remember it."

I'd spring for a baja designs kit, I've only read bad things about the tusk, my wr450 has the baja and it works very well.

supermoto,36vhry,TREEholic,3,Fri May 22 14:37:28 2015 UTC,Thanks dude! Would there be any downside to adjusting/changing the suspension? I'm mainly going to use it for street riding but there are some trails around my area I'd like to hit which are a bit bumpy.
supermoto,36vhry,buttrapinpirate,2,Fri May 22 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"There's a potential for it being a downside in that you have less travel, however, someone at your height would probably counteract that by lowering your CG and standing on the pegs. Also, how much do you weigh? Since you might not weigh as much as someone a little taller, you may not be able to fully utilize the full travel, and therefore the differences minimal between you and someone whose weight requires the full stroke of the shock.  Back to your original question though, I find a DRZ tall at 5'11"" with long legs (34"" inseam). But I've ridden a 450 when I was much shorter, and in sand and technical trails. So it's definitely not impossible. You will certainly get good quickly when having to make up for not being able to easily stomp a foot down to prevent yourself from falling. I'm not saying you'll fall all the time, but it might be a slightly steeper learning curve.  The last thing I can ask is; have you ridden a dirt bike before, or are you coming from street bikes, or no bike experience? Regardless, the DRZ is a fun bike, but before you dive into it, just sit up on one in a dealership, or someone who's willing to entertain your inquiry locally, and balance it off the kickstand and get a feel for it. And then if possible give it a test ride. Just sitting on it will get you an idea of what you can handle. Then figure out how much a lowering kit and seat will drop the ride height for you, and then find a bike at that seat height, with a similar width, and that might get you a sense for what a lowered DRZ will feel like at say, a stop light.  Good luck! Hopefully the DRZ will work out for you, it's an awesome bike"
supermoto,36vhry,buttrapinpirate,2,Fri May 22 15:11:10 2015 UTC,Wow thanks that makes a lot of sense! I weigh 132lbs. Only experience I have is road bikes and I'll definitely take your advice and check it out at a dealer. Thanks again!
supermoto,36vhry,Motocid,2,Fri May 22 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Yeah at 130 pounds you probably won't need a ton of stroke on the suspension so that is going to help you a lot
supermoto,36vhry,Goblet_Grechen,2,Fri May 22 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"Check out the seat by Seat Concepts. Dramatically lowers seat height without having to adjust suspension, plus it's waaay more comfortable than stock. There's a good comparison on TT.  Just so you've got an idea, I'm 5'9"" with 29 inseam and I can just hardly flat-foot it if I'm standing straight up, using stock seat."

After you've got the triple mounts installed start from the bar ends and work in.  Install the plastics last.  You'll need to bend them just a little but shouldn't be anything too extreme.

I have replaced dirtbike clutches, and removed/installed for inspection on street bikes and it is very straight forward. 500 seems a bit steep compared to a wimpy dirtbike clutch which is more like 80$ or something but without looking, it doesn't surprise me on not only a bigger/newer bike but a KTM. 18k doesn't sound like a scary amount of miles. If the bike runs fine, replace the clutch and go another 18 on it!  B"

If you are a dirt-biker at heart, I think you want to go more towards the street legal enduro (e.g. KTM 500 EXC).  I ride my KTM 450 EXC on the street AND I race it off-road: https://flic.kr/p/t7NTJ8  The EXC has some street downsides, but JEBUS it is fun.  Small tank, high maintenance compared to DRZ and most street bikes.  Expensive parts.  The maintenance to me isn't a big deal - my 450 is a 2008 and the valves have never needed adjusting - I change the oil every few months, and keep a clean air filter on it.  Seat sucks for long distance rides - but is awesome for the short ones.  Upsides: Top-of-the-class performance.  Wheelies anytime, awesome clutch and brakes.  Handles great.  You can race it off-road (it really is a motocross bike with lights).  I also have a KTM 990 Supermoto, but for all out fun, I'll take the 450."

Parts are hard to come by and a lot more cost compared to things like Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha.  DRZ are decent bikes as well. But if you're looking to do any racing or aggressive riding you'll have a hard time keeping up.  The reason I have a yz250 and a crf450 is because of the parts and reliability. I can source whole engines off ebay and rebuild them for very little money. With a Husky you typically have to order parts that have to come new from Europe. There is no real used market for Husky parts I've found yet, maybe someone with Husky experience here can chime in on this?"

I'm not super concerned with going fast but who doesn't like to open it up, and is it easy to pull a good wheelie on? Plus I wouldn't have to buy wheels + tires, and maintenance is better.

Decided on the Pilot Power 2CT's. The back tire is back ordered, so I haven't got the set yet, but rumor is that they are a great tire for the road and pretty mediocre offroad."

Can you describe the sound more?  My other thought is dead battery or that it is earthing to the frame from a loose connection, making the battery not get any power from the stator.

supermoto,36bsby,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Mon May 18 16:56:47 2015 UTC,Appears to be the avon distanzia
supermoto,36bsby,Rubbinmysloth,1 point,Tue May 19 01:30:51 2015 UTC,I don't own a pair but I know someone who does. His chain rubs a little and marks up the side of the tread. Doesn't really look like it damages it though. The distanzias are like 70% road/ 30% trail.
supermoto,36bsby,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Tue May 19 03:02:51 2015 UTC,According to revzilla its actually a 90 10
supermoto,36bsby,vanillagueriller,1 point,Tue May 19 03:15:15 2015 UTC,The chain sits a few mm from the tyre. I can't really tell if it rubs or not however the other side constantly rubs on the inside of the swingarm - you can see the mark on the tyre in the photo. They are avon distanzia's. 90/10 or 80/20 some claim. Definitely not a dual sport tyre. They handle pretty good on dirt and gravel but will slide fairly easily if you snap the throttle on the looser stuff. Zero to very little grip on grass. Haven't tried mud but useless from what I've heard. On the road they feel very sticky and confidence inspiring. Even in the rain they feel good. I bought them so that I could hit dirt roads occasionally but I feel like I could do the same with a 100% road tyre (as I have seen many do here and on youtube). My next pair will be a true road tyre because I feel there will be less vibration but that's not to say I'm not happy with the distanzia's.
supermoto,36bsby,vanillagueriller,1 point,Tue May 19 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting, tires seem pretty good. I currently have a 140/70 Michelin Street radial rear and 120/70 Pirelli Angel GT front. Really happy with the Pirelli's, and ideally I would like to get a new set front and back and have the same tire, as I find the street radial really soft and spongey even at high pressure, which is good for grip, however not for the life of them. I have the same sort of situation with traction. Road and dirt roads are okay. Find I have my leg out on dirt corner just because the thing steers like a boat on the gravel, and grass is like lowside roulette. Had a few instances of 2 wheel slides but im tall enough to flat foot and stand over my little 450 so that kind of saved me. Wet grass is another story again, bit of fun for rolling burnouts but I really dont trust it. Have also spent 3 hours enduro riding through trails with the supermoto, just to muck around a bit. Found that mud is really quite awful if you have to work through it, but as far as hitting some at upright position with a bit of momentum, no substantial difference to a set of dual sports or even small mud tires. Nasty to try and get through it though, just ends up spinning and needing a good push. Thanks for the info, thinking I should probably keep to 140 or 150 for tyres, 160 might be overkill"

supermoto,3610dp,Soulshott,1 point,Sat May 16 09:40:10 2015 UTC,"For what its worth man, and just my opinion so take this with a grain of salt.  Buy a used dirt bike you like.  Its a LOT more rewarding to build something.  Changing wheels and tires is super easy, and if not too terrible even if you're not mechanically inclined.  A few bolts and you're good to go.  I picked up my 2008 250SXF for 2300 last year, and went through it all during the winter (New England baby!).  It came out really nice and was a learning experience for me.  Its also easier to buy something used, pay it off/save up for it, learn how to ride it, and then add the other pieces rather than all up front.  For what its worth."

supermoto,3610dp,ender_wiggum,1 point,Sat May 23 22:37:21 2015 UTC,The yz450f makes a good supermoto. Either that or sell the yz get a 500 exc and toss wheels on it. Either make great motards. Keep your dirt wheels and you have the best of both worlds.   I know the boat your in my wife supports my habit and lately I'm hating debt so my zx14r is going by by and my yz450f is getting converted to the street. But I'm keeping my dirt set up.   The fuel injected bikes make an easy conversion so I'd vote moto your current yz. Nothing more entertaining than a full blown mx bike on supermoto rubber ask anyone who's done it.

supermoto,35wxl6,Vital_Cobra,9,Thu May 14 10:09:51 2015 UTC,"It's actually a honda XL 600 (or possibly a mix between XL and XR parts). One of the key giveaways on this bike is the little lid on the frame between the tank and the triple clamps. That's actually a dipstick because that part of the frame is used as an oil tank. You'll notice the rest of the engine looks identical to the bike I linked, except for the carb (there's actually two on a stock bike), so I don't know what he's done there. He probably had to change it in order to fit the airbox somewhere else."

supermoto,35wxl6,balrog558,1 point,Thu May 14 14:43:00 2015 UTC,Yes it does but mostly because of riding position. You can get up on the tank as easily as on the stock bike. You're forced to sit back a few inches and reach forward a bit more.

Shouldn't be that much of a surprise since a lot of the parts are interchangeable. I use the xr header pipes on my xl. On second look you're probably right because the carb looks like the xr one.
supermoto,35wxl6,bunBpimpC,2,Thu May 14 14:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those are definitely XL headers. But the frame looks identical to an XR to me. Like you said, more than likely a mix."

supermoto,35wi0u,rctaylors,2,Thu May 14 02:24:07 2015 UTC,"As an owner of an XRR I can only dream of doing this one day, as it is my primary vehicle.  The key for me is the USD forks. They look too silly with 17's, supermoto fender, and the regular forks.  The newer model plastics really help too.  Was it hard to fit different plastics?"
supermoto,35wi0u,phorensic,3,Thu May 14 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"The front shrouds bolt right into the aluminum tank, the bottom has little brackets that mount to the standard radiator shroud mounts. The tail is cut off short, and a new tail is bolted and glued to the old tail, hidden under the seat. The CRF plastics really change the look.  The USD forks are so unbelievably better than the standards. The old forks feel like bendy straws."
supermoto,35wi0u,phorensic,2,Thu May 14 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"Oh you have a CRF tank too.  I can't do that, I love my 4.6 gallon too much, I commute 80-100 miles per day.  I know what you are talking about on the forks.  When I was trying to balance my dirt wheels at 80 mph for commuting I still had wheel locks inside the rims which gave me this horrible vibration above 50 mph.  I could literally watch the forks flex a significant amount back and forth just from the vibration!  As an armchair engineer I understand things have to flex a little bit, and it's actually what makes steel frame bikes like KTM's perform a little better (and be more comfortable), but this seemed kind of ridiculous.  The stock forks are not a large enough diameter, IMO, even though valved properly they work really well.  It's that larger diameter of USD forks that makes the 17's look better as well."
supermoto,35wi0u,BathtubSnorkeler,1 point,Thu May 14 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yea the tank definitely changes routes of choice, its a 1.7ish gallons, I like to plan for fuel ~60-70 miles to be safe.  The big forks look great! much more sportbike front end vs spindly little chopper front end."

supermoto,35qgl7,from_dust,5,Tue May 12 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the 09 530 EXC.  If it doesn't have a cooling fan, add one.  The KTM powerparts fan is very good.  I have an 08 450 EXC.  I race if off-road and ride it to work.  Great bike."

supermoto,35qgl7,ender_wiggum,2,Tue May 12 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"If it is clean, then yes. I dont ever believe people when say 30 hours. You can tell by the wear spot below the seat where your legs rub. Inspect the bike, check compression, any receipts for maintenance? Does the work himself? If he does it himself, look at his house, yard mowed? Does the dude keep his shit tight and clean or not? If so, ya I think it is a good deal. Used bikes are a gamble, but KTM makes a solid bike, unless he just flat out abused it, then you probably got a good deal, is he original owner? Bring 5k cash and wave it around. Never know, shit start at 4,5k see what you can do."
supermoto,35qgl7,SuMoto,1 point,Tue May 12 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"A little high, IMHO.  $4500 to $5000 if in really good shape.  If he has all the stock parts (especially the stock seat), towards the upper end.  Believe it or not, some of those soft seats are worse over long rides: the foam heats up, gets even softer, and you end up riding on the frame.  The headlight upgrade is truly needed for night-riding... the stock lamp is awful.  Make sure it it is nice and bright.  Make sure that engine is in good shape...  I bet you can talk him down to the right territory."
supermoto,35qgl7,SumoSect,3,Tue May 12 20:32:54 2015 UTC,I would steer clear of the Aprilia SXV's unless you are a seasoned rider and really like to fix bikes. They are rocket-ship on two wheels but love the shop. Not for beginners.

Older photo: http://i.imgur.com/HBzQjGR.jpg  More mods: http://imgur.com/1q7WXKq  Warp 9s front/rear anywhere between 899-1200 depending on color options.  So far I have about 14k miles on it. Maintenance  is very simple  like any dirtbike. Oil, 500 miles or 10 hours. Valves are every 1000miles or 100 hours. Personally after the 3rd valve check we do it every 4k. Haven't  had them move yet.    Currently. using belrays  15-50 Esther oil. K/n oil filter. About 20$ to change oil. Airfilter as needed.  Sprockets are 15 front 44 rear.  Over 120 mph is possible.  Highly recommend getting a stabilizer.  It makes world's of difference.   Personally, an out of the box ktm will out preform any of the ""equivalent"" sumo's.. wr450, drz, etc. However it is a race bike. It isn't designed for the road like a road bike.  Regarding sprockets, and chain - They're replaced at the end of chain life. Running a DID Erv3 chain.  Apologies for the rambling. I'm coming off some intense medications  from surgery.

I used to have sport bikes as my daily ride.. but I dont expect that level of use with this bike as I have my truck and wifes car that will take the majority of the commuting.    Is there any other ""converting"" a dirt ready EXC will need for (mostly) street riding?"
supermoto,35qgl7,trebor89,1 point,Tue May 12 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"Nessecary? None that come to mind. Riding at night? Invest in better bulbs or.. illegaly  ride with a baja designs led.  Upgrade your horn if you want.. otherwise I would suggest quality tires. Running with battleax 003Rs  at the moment.   I'm assuming the blinkers, front/rear are operational. I would suggest a mirror you can move around.. I'm partial to the ram mount/ ""double take"" mirror.  http://www.doubletakemirror.com/"
supermoto,35qgl7,fake_tea,1 point,Tue May 12 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary for a supermoto. KTM are basically race bikes. The WR will be better, and Suzuki's offerings are even better for low maintenance. I have a DR650, which is more traditional dual sport and less suko, but the oil change interval is like 8000 miles iirc. Basically, avoid KTM unless you're a really awesome rider doing very technical riding, or just don't mind that.  Consider how expensive maintenance will be unless you do it yourself. An hour's labor for valve clearance every 1000 miles? No need to have a KTM for a first sumo."
supermoto,35qgl7,dirtysanchez2626,2,Wed May 13 01:55:42 2015 UTC,"I have a sumo dr and its been a sweet bike. I think the oil interval is 3k miles but that's still awesome, I do it every 2k or so since it's easy and Rotella is cheap.  It ain't no ktm but I can keep up with everybody I've come across on it, cruise 80 for extended periods, and still handle some tame off roading if i come across a decent looking trail."
supermoto,35qgl7,SumoSect,1 point,Wed May 13 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Shit, yeah, I'm thinking of my 1100.  My DR is obviously the same maintenance interval as yours.  They are fun bikes; unless I'm riding over 90 minutes or carrying people or luggage, I grab the DR every time.  I should probably sumo it, but I keep telling myself I'm going to ride off road."
supermoto,35qgl7,hangerbaby,2,Wed May 13 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"I bought mine with both sets. If I could do it over I would have gotten a newer stock one and just run ds tires, but the sm tires are fun. I have a woods bike so if I really want to offroad I take that, it's a lot more fun offroad, the dr is kind of porky and soft and has no clearance."
supermoto,35qgl7,erode,2,Wed May 13 04:19:23 2015 UTC,Few questions for you (sorry OP not relevant to you but get a KTM): 1. How big is that tank and how many miles you getting. 2. what steering stabilizer do you use

supermoto,35qgl7,RyanTally,1 point,Wed May 13 00:25:37 2015 UTC,Yes its generally a good idea to take at least the rear sprocket down a bit
supermoto,35qgl7,roger_podakter,2,Wed May 13 02:45:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that once upon a time, KTM earned its rep for being high maintenance. I've owned an RFS, and i currently ride an lc4. The RFS was ""higher"" maintenance, but even that wasn't bad. My valves were always in spec and an oil change takes 15 minutes. The LC4 is super low maintenance. Even if it was double the wrench time, the orange bikes are lighter and faster with premium stock components. Ride one. I dare you not to buy one."
supermoto,35qgl7,RyanTally,4,Wed May 13 19:00:10 2015 UTC,WRs are tight but expensive.  KTM requires a lot of maintenance but oh so tight.  Then there are DRZs.  Which /u/Ryantally showed us girls ride.....  choose wisely.
supermoto,35qgl7,roger_podakter,2,Wed May 13 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy... How is the cage life treating you? Roger is right about the KTM, I know since I own one as my dirt beast, it is a two stroke and it does require a shit ton of maintenance, but worth it. Just remember the rule ""it is more fun to ride a slow bike fast, then to die on a fast bike because you do not know what the fuck you are doing. I kid, but truly the DRZ, even though hated by some (Roger) , is a great bike. I just did air box mod and jetting and the bike really came to life. Not 450exc life, but strong, fast and reliable. After all of this has been said, I would buy the KTM.   To do a solid convert your looking at about $1,500 IMO, some guys will tell you less. If you are new to this, which I am also, I would suggest getting the KTM and buying a set of warp 9's and then ride it. Do other mods once you figure out what you like and dont like. After that, Mod the brakes and suspension. Good luck!   Also what state are you in? My buddy is selling his Husky."

Good advice though with parts specific to this bike; I'll do some more research.  Haha KTM are pretty common, and there is definitely a reason for it, I'm just looking for something a little different.

supermoto,35ruud,Sterling44,2,Thu May 14 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. I'd love for people to get more interested in this bike.  I've been browsing /r/supermoto for inspiration on how to turn this beast into a proper street machine. I'm currently running 100% stock and on dual sport tires (think 90% dirt/10% street) not approved for speeds higher than 55mph. I have the power boost plugged in and the bike is fun as hell on the street. Only thing holding me back is the tread on the tire during turns. The seat height is high but 17"" wheels will help that a little. Gearing is dirt tuned but I have no problem topping out at 75mph quickly. I wouldn't ride too long on the highway because of how light the bike is. Not the most confidence inspiring with crosswind blowing you all around.  I don't have a key or immobilizer. It has a steering lock. And I use a heavy motorcycle lock if I'm parking it anywhere that isn't my garage. BMW sold this bike with a three year warranty and as a dual sport. Maintenance has been every 10-15 hours I do an oil change. Every third oil change I do a valve check. Not once have I had to adjust my valves and the oil looks like it could go twice as long. I'm just following the maintenance to spec.  It has a small fuel tank. I get about 80 miles between fill ups."

It has been a GREAT first road bike, but I have learned from it what I do and don't want on the next one. I would definitely rather go with a WR450 or even 250 and convert it. I'm way more comfortable on dirtbikes and that is essentially what those two are."
supermoto,35q9ew,cklly2013,2,Tue May 12 17:19:23 2015 UTC,I ended up letting mine sit and not riding. It killed batteries all the time it left me stranded on several occasions. Still the most fun bike I have owned but I wish I went with the wr250 or a Klx. Though I am thinking about getting another bike.
supermoto,35q9ew,cklly2013,2,Tue May 12 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"A 440 big bore kit will really open it up along with a 41mm flat slide carb. I actually prefer the carb over FI. With a straight through exhaust, you get to hear the amazing sounds of the DRZ. It pops and bangs so much when you let off the throttle. You don't get no pops or bangs with FI unless it's programed in. The DR-Z has the biggest modding community as well. I bought mine brand new. Yes it could've been cheaper but it has a lot of character."

supermoto,35q9ew,WildxYak,1 point,Tue May 12 22:23:50 2015 UTC,Not really that much more money. $400 for big bore kit $500 for the carb $450 for the exhaust

Just keep your eyes open.   These bike have such a following, if you want it faster, you can make it faster. If you want it lighter, you can make it lighter.

A few things to look out for is the bikes tend to run hot so make sure the bike has a radiator fan installed, around 110 hours is the mark where you need a top end rebuild( KTM has the worst stock pistons). The bikes tend to be jetted a bit rich stock so getting a JD jetting kit or rejecting it yourself is good(ads some noticeable power). The exhaust is too big and has to be cut open and de smoged. The stock battery is shit and won't hold much charge. Check for marks on where the kick starter meets the foot peg. The cam chain tensioner should be replaced with a dirt Trix can chain tensioner or your bike will develop a bad knock. That's all I can think of ATM. The bike hits 100 kms in 4th gear so they'll beat any other 4smoker sumo."

supermoto,3567sg,StevoMann,1 point,Thu May 7 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"2nd gear clutch it up,  it's going to take a shit load of practice and takes awhile to actually get comfortable holding the wheelie.  It will be scary as shit at first but you will get used to it just like anything else.  Also remember the balance point is just past the point where you feel comfortable in a wheelie.  But when u  get to the balance point it feels wonderful. Little braps are all u need up there."
supermoto,3567sg,Glockamolee,0,Thu May 7 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thats very damn reassuring. Found that comfort height a few times, but usually just back the throttle to 0 and let the bike pull down really quickly, not very nice. I will have to practice a bit, so I might head down to a parking lot tomorrow afternoon. Only thing is that I have about 100ft of pavement before I have to turn around, so maybe that is a bad idea. Any suggestions about distances. I would prefer to keep speeds slow while I'm leaning, but I do also have access to about 1.5miles of abandoned fire road out near a freeway that I used to do top speed tests. Really sage advice, it means a lot to get a personal response."

supermoto,3567sg,huzzaboot,1 point,Thu May 7 14:58:09 2015 UTC,Start really slow and get used to hovering your rear brake. I learned wheelies doing power wheelies. Once I was able to keep it up I taught myself how to do clutch up wheelies . once you get the hang of doing clutch ups and holding it then you can learn how to shift gears that's when it becomes real fun. Just be careful and remember the rear brake is your friend.
supermoto,3567sg,Theredcrayola,1 point,Thu May 7 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"I'd get some knobbies and practice on the dirt.  I grew up on motocross bikes, and can wheelie just about anything.  For the record, I hardly ever clutch my 450 EXC up... the thing has so much power you don't need it.  Get on the dirt, and practice in first gear (start with the clutch).  You WILL loop it.  Don't worry, just keep the wheelie slow, and if you go over just drop your feet down and jump back on the bike.  You might fall, but you'll be fine in first.  Ultimately, you have to loop it a few times to know where the 'end' is.  Soon it'll be second nature."
supermoto,3567sg,roger_podakter,1 point,Thu May 7 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"Start small, build the good habits early.  Get used to bringing the front wheel down with the rear brake instead of cutting the throttle. I built this habit late, and 12 o'clocked it in the process.  You may also want to look into a tailbone guard for your practice sessions.   It'll take time, but you'll find that each wheelie you do goes a little higher and lasts a little longer. Eventually, you'll find that the front tire is coming down because you want it to, and not on its own."

Previous thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/supermoto/comments/34apzt/so_close_to_my_supermoto_wr450_pics_when_done/  Waiting on oil seals for the bearings, but everything looks good. Wheel is balanced, brake meshes well, spins nicely, spacers are snug, pinch bolts grab, the Outer Diameter of the spacers sits nicely on the inside of the bearings, does not spin with the wheel. SO ready to start riding!  Going to get rid of those ugly front blinkers and put some flush mounts on there sometime in the coming weeks. End of season will add a YZ exhaust.  Question: should I re install the fork guards? They do rub, so I would have to file them down, but I kind of like the look with no fork guards, could I do no guards for the street only? If so where should I route that brake/speedo cable?   Question 2: any way to clean that clear gas tank? It is particularly yellow..."
supermoto,3533f3,RyanTally,3,Wed May 6 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"You are in for a lot of work by not running your fork guards. Shave them and move on. Buy a new gas tank if color bothers you, or paint it. The plastic is not savable at this point.    Also, good job man! This is a beast!"
supermoto,3533f3,roboticbobwhite,3,Wed May 6 19:15:01 2015 UTC,"Oy, PLEASE do not paint plastic mx tanks. It will flake off from the fumes being released by the gas in the tank and look absolutely terrible in short order.   Buy a new tank if it bothers you that much and sell the stained one on eBay or craigslist. Plenty of others will be willing to buy the old tank so that you can recoup some of that money.  A grinder with a flap disc made quick work of trimming my fork guards, although most any large sander would work."

It scraped off quite easily if you rubbed against it (keep in mind this was mostly a street bike) so I would be hesitant to use it on a strictly offroad/woods bike, but plastidip isn't difficult to touch up when it gets damaged.   That being said, I personally would not be willing to sacrifice a $200 IMS or Clarke tank to try it again (no matter how stained), but would like to try dipping another old/cheapo tank at some point in the future.

On my 625 I had a small four piston Brembo caliper with a 13mm Brembo master, which also worked really well. My old 450SMR had that same 13mm Brembo master with the 6 piston Beringer caliper, which I also liked a lot. All of those setups had 320mm rotors.   If you're not into spending a ton of cash try a 320mm rotor with a caliper relocating bracket and some street pads. That way even if you want to upgrade to a better caliper you can still use your 320mm rotor."

I'm biased toward the Husky - Mine is over 8k miles clocked without any overhaul and runs like a champ. Oil changes every 400-500 miles, which get pricey. Roughly $45 per change/month for me. I'm thinking the 07s were carbed though, so long as they have it set up right it's a pretty solid bike. DRZ plebs can stuff it - Husky master race FTW.  Don't let the maintenance scare you away, I've only re-shimmed valves once, and it wasn't even that necessary, it was just to learn how. Checked valves a couple days ago - still in spec after 5k miles of pretty hard riding."
supermoto,350ifk,NRCSLC,1 point,Wed May 6 18:44:44 2015 UTC,"Those are 3 very different beasts. The husky is a bit of a maintance whore, so only get that one if you got some mechanic skills. The DRZ and 625 are a bit more street worthy and you can rack up some miles on those. I ride sumos on the highway and don't mind it, not going to be the most comfy bike to ride on the interstate, but I have put the DRZ to the test. I ran the bike for 3 straight months commuting with 14/45 gearing, never pushed it over 60mph with that gearing. I eventually went with 15/42 sprockets and that worked well at 70/75mph. I did a leak down test after racking 12,000 highway miles and yielded results of 3%, which is great, so yes, the DRZ is fine for highway. I changed the oil every 1000 miles however. All that being said, I have never rode a 625, but I have heard great things, and assume it to be a more road worthy bike. So pick which ever one you like best. I would avoid the husky tho, I had a 2009 510smr and found it to be a tad bit too aggressive for street crusing, it's really a race bike with tags."

The maintenance on the Husky isnt a huge deal for me, but I already own two vehicles that require a lot of maintenance, not looking for a third, so not looking into that one anymore. Also if something does happen to the Husky, parts may be a bit harder to get for it (and pricier? i dont know)."

I've ridden mine 400 miles on the highway in a single day (not recommended without an aftermarket seat!) at 70-85 mph indicated, and have frequently raced up to 95-98 indicated. They will run all day every day on the highway with stock gearing, and going up a tooth in the front and down a tooth (or two) in the back will make things even better.  They are also reliable as hell, run like a clock, and you can change the oil/filter in 20 minutes or less, which is really all the maintenance you will have to do in between the ultra-wide valve adjustment intervals. There are a ton of great aftermarket parts available and lots of spares available on eBay.  It's a no-brainer. DRZ 400SM all the way."

supermoto,34ri6o,RyanTally,2,Mon May 4 07:11:38 2015 UTC,"No, aluminum doesn't rust. It does corrode but when it does it doesn't flake off like rust so the outside layer of corrosion will actually protect the rest of the aluminum and just make it dull gray looking. Look at aluminum dirtbike frames for an example, they don't get rusty but start to look like shit still."

supermoto,34s7u4,griffWWK,5,Mon May 4 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Man that's just such a big question. TL;DR: find a bike you think you want on craigslist and ask us what we think of it, google it, and test-ride it.   Craigslist is good if you're not too picky about the bike and just looking for a quality deal. Go to owner-motorcycles and set your price range. When I was looking for mine I searched ""plated, supermoto, street legal, dual sport, sm"".   Have you done any research into the bike you want? It's pretty important. The way I do it is I find a bike I think I really like on craigslist and then google that bike looking for user reviews and forum posts. Reading those will usually tell you what you need to know about the weak areas, common issues, and what it does right.  Google the specs. Consider parts availability (mostly based on manufacturer), common problems, weight, torque, hp, appearance, and how easy it is to work on. Try to do all your own mechanical work, a bike is way simpler than a car. Top speed doesn't mean anything unless it's below 70mph because it's your first bike. I don't mean for your safety, I just think your power-weight ratio is more important and you're not going to know any better. Don't buy an adventure bike, you want a supermoto.  When you go to see the bike in person, bring an experienced buddy to test ride and inspect it. Check the condition of the chain and sprocket and tires. Anything that's broken or needs to be replaced probably costs at least $50-100 dollars so use those to drive the price down. There's probably way better tutorials on the internet about inspecting bikes before a purchase so go find one of those.  You're probably going to drop it so don't buy anything too expensive and pretty."
supermoto,34s7u4,Misplaced_Suspicion,1 point,Mon May 4 06:36:47 2015 UTC,Do you think this is priced well? I went to look at the bike but it needs a battery and regular maintenance stuff done. I was trying not to spend more than 2k
supermoto,34s7u4,Peace_Brother,1 point,Mon May 4 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"You forgot to post a link. $2000 is a good price to pay. I've had five bikes and I haven't paid more than $3000 for any of them. You can always talk down on Craigslist.  There's two kinds of bike that don't have a battery. One is the one that the previous owner drained all the fluids out of to set up in storage, that's the one you want because you just need $2-300 in fluids and parts and whatnot and you'll be on the road. The other kind has been sitting for awhile and that one's way more work for you. You have to drain the fluids yourself and buy a battery and even when you do those basic things the bike probably won't start."

A new pipe and a power commander brings up it's bottom end a fair bit from stock and it's maintenance intervals are huge. Something like 3000 miles per oil change and check valves for the first time at 26000.   5th and 6th are overdrive which helps keep up highway speeds without your revs being totally tapped out.  Sadly they're rather expensive since they haven't been selling the X trim WR250 in US/Canada for a few years.  A WR450X from the factory with the same maintenance as the 250 would take over the market. WHERE IS IT YAMAHA?! GIVE IT TO MEEEEEE!!"

She's big, heavy and old school low tech and looks. I'd stay away from the husky, they are notoriously hard to get parts for. Have you looked into buying a DRZ-400S or E (depending on your state's plating laws) and converting it to supermoto?  I've seen a guy ride a WR250X, seems like a solid bike but mostly underpowered. All the reviews say it's very similar in almost all categories to the DRZ400SM.  Convert a WR450 is another option. Again depending on if your state allows you to plate it for the street.  Older KTM's can be found sumo-ed for reasonable prices (sometimes). A Sumo 640 would be a blast."

I dont see any negatives for you if you don't mind kicking it.  Kick starting is a lot easier than most people think.  The trick is scrubbing off a little compression before giving it a full kick.

The WR250X and the DRZ will behave very similar, and I think the WR250's actually have more bottom end. (Nearest comparison I have is my yz250, which does power wheelies in 1st and 2nd without too much trouble).  You may want to look at a dirt conversion, as a WR450 is pretty awesome.

The bike is an absolute beast!   It takes 2-3 kicks to start dead cold and 1 once it has warmed up.   As some others have commented it comes down to using the proper procedure by pushing the kick down softly until you find top dead centre (lever is at it's stiffest) then using the decomp lever to push the lever slightly passed that point. Let the lever come back to the top so you have a full stroke and it will fire up with ease.  The gearboxs are a 5 speed and I don't find myself searching for another gear as I have with all of my other/previous bikes (XR250R, XR400R & Ninja 300). With a 45 tooth sprocket it will cruise comfortably at 120km/h in fourth, 5th I have stretched to 180. You definitely won't regret going with the XRR!  Edit: gearing"

supermoto,349vuz,wagigkpn,1 point,Fri May 1 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"What should you expect? (XR650R owner for 2 years) Wheelies. Throttle only wheelies up to third gear, sometimes 4th if you are good. Clutch up wheelies in all 5 gears. My brother bought his XR650r from a guy because he was afraid of losing his license cause he could not force himself to not wheelie all the time. He isn't lying.   I'm 6'7'' and i am tip toed at stop lights. Love it.   I run Rotella T6 motor oil (buy it on amazon!). I go way over 1k miles per change.   The stock bars are set up in your lap, I got an XRs only tripple clamp with 3"" risers and some Rox pivoting bar clamps to get the handle bars up and out of the cockpit. Best decision ever. I had to buy new cables cause the stock ones wouldnt reach (motionpro- $40 per cable).   Max speed is depending on sprocket choice. I think i am -3 in the rear and i max out at 80-85 mph but dont like going over 70-75. (Non SM wheels).   Kick start is a breeze and no starter/battery problems to leave you stranded.   It needs to keep moving. Dont run without a thermostat as it will 'wash out' the radiators effectivness as it will pump water through them too quickly. If you live in a hot area I strongly advise you to upgrade your stator (rickystator) and wire in a fan. either that or be prepared to lane split to keep moving and prevent boil over.   The XR is the Pinnacle of dual sports (originally dirt only so you have to convert, check state laws regarding if this is allowed). It weighs less than 300 lbs wet. has oil squirts on all 5 gears so long slabs on the road in a single gear is no problem. It has so much power you wont know what to do with it all. It's the last dirt bike that Honda made that was not strung out. The CRF's might be comparable or better in power but they are not designed to run forever like the xr650r. It runs like my old xr200 ran. And lastly, I didnt believe this to be true, the XR650R and XR650L are COMPLETELY different bikes. I have owned both and there is zero commonality. I never really trusted my 6'7'' 300lb frame on the L. The R still scares me and im more worried about it braking me than the other way around."

supermoto,346yag,snoopy3875,6,Tue Apr 28 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Get a badass sumo of any kind, then buy a shit 2 stroke to beat the shit out of offroad."
supermoto,346yag,N4suhr,2,Tue Apr 28 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"The trouble with the DRZ rim swap is that the front brake disc on the SM is considerably larger than the S, meaning:    The SM isn't great offroad due to (other than the street tires obviously) the increased likelihood of wanging the front disc and damaging it, as it doesn't have as much clearance over rocks etc. as the S, which has a smaller front disc.  An adaptor bracket is going to be needed to accommodate the different sized disc if going SM to S - i.e. it's not a straight swap. (I've only done a sumo conversion on my EXC so I may be talking bollocks on 2. - hopefully someone can confirm).  Suspension should be looked at too. Offroad and road are very different set ups and this can make a world of difference.   One other cheap option is to get SM style tyres (as opposed to whole new rims) and swap them out with the S tyres. You won't have strict SM wheels, but it leads to less (or perhaps I should say a different type of) faffing. There are quite a few half and half tyres you may want to consider too, but these tend to be jacks of all trades and master of none in my (limited) experience."
supermoto,346yag,ratatooie,2,Tue Apr 28 22:20:29 2015 UTC,"if i had a nickel... why would you put 17's on an enduro and dirt wheels on a sm?  it's like asking what a good car is for offroading and time attack races in a parking lot.  if anything, you'd want a supermoto that you have a spare DIRT ONLY wheelset for, and swap appropriately. shitty suspension in the dirt kind of sucks, but shitty suspension in the twisties is fucking terrifying... btw drz-s' don't even have inverted forks, just the old style wiggly little babies"
supermoto,346yag,tifuandlostmydrone,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:20:21 2015 UTC,"The compromise is really dirt rubber on street wheels (17"" knobbies) or street rubber on dirt wheels (slicks on whatever size dirt wheels). Once you have both sets of wheels and tires, you're only compromise is really the front disk size. The larger SM rotor on dirt wheels is a little grabby for the dirt and can potentially hit some rocks. So what? How much does a stock DRZ-SM rotor cost on ebay or amazon? Like $35. Boohoo. Get a spare and pack it around if you're afraid."

It also does not mention if it has been converted for street, so I would assume it hasn't yet. In some states I know it is easy to get a street title (like AZ), but a few states do not even allow conversions (WI if I remember correctly).   Consider the cost of a SM conversion kit plus the time/money for making this bike street legal (and upgrading the exhaust which your ad doesn't mention has been done); you are looking at a 12 year old bike that will have nearly $4-5K into it. I did see a couple of already converted/factory sumo bikes on the Spokane cl for around that price, but they were considerably newer bikes.  Swapping the wheels over isn't ""hard"" but is a pain if you plan on doing it every weekend or so. I ended up buying a cheap dirtbike for the occasions I wanted to ride trails for about what I sold the dirt wheels from my converted sumo for.   Best of luck."

I feel like $5K for an 08 is a bit pricey (weren't those around $6 new?) and if you have 2-4 weeks to keep shopping (or expand your search to neighboring areas) you could do better.   The WR250X is a factory street sumo, and I'm not sure if it is possible to just swap a set of offroad wheels onto that bike, although I'm sure someone else would know.

It took me 2-3 hours to install my sumo wheels the first time, and somewhat less time subsequently once I learned the right technique. I know some people who say they can swap their setups in 20 minutes, but I was just never that quick.   If you are on a tight budget or just lack the space for another bike, nothing stopping you from swapping them whenever you want, but I personally found that my time was better spent doing other things.

supermoto,33vjxh,BickNlinko,2,Sun Apr 26 12:06:15 2015 UTC,Minis are fucking dangerous. I've seen more dudes wreck themselves on minis than I have on big bikes. So many broken collar bones. ...
supermoto,33vjxh,SemperFiGuy,2,Sun Apr 26 08:03:26 2015 UTC,Some of the worst crashes i've seen are from mini's.  There was a lady at this event that had broken her femur racing a mini.
supermoto,33vjxh,BickNlinko,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:08:28 2015 UTC,Why is this? Is it because there's less respect for the machine and more inclination to do stupid shit?
supermoto,33vjxh,SemperFiGuy,2,Sun Apr 26 16:03:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you feel invincible because you're riding a child's bike...and then you crash and fuck yourself up. I've seen my buddies absolutely wreck themselves on minis in the dirt and on the asphalt...broken collar bones, some dude broke his leg one time. Gnarly."
supermoto,33sc0f,Ronix523,3,Sat Apr 25 03:42:02 2015 UTC,"2007 Drz400sm with 5000 miles. Paid $3,000 for her! The only problem with it, is that the taillight and license plate light won't light up unless the rear brake is applied. If you guys know anything about it let me know!"
supermoto,33sc0f,Towelie62,3,Sat Apr 25 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"Easy Fix. The taillight and license plate light are currently hardwired into the same wire that the rear brake switch is on. You need to take the wires from the tail light and license plate light and tap them into the circuit elsewhere where there is constant power, and not just power when the brake is applied. For instance the headlight is a good example because the taillight and license plate light will only be on when the headlight is on, and won't drain the battery when the bike is off."
supermoto,33sc0f,huzzaboot,2,Sat Apr 25 14:19:06 2015 UTC,It sounds like this bike got wired up by someone who thought they knew what they were doing.

supermoto,33lcf4,Foxeh-,7,Thu Apr 23 13:36:15 2015 UTC,Coming from the dirt this is my first supermoto. I have raced motocross for many years now and finally decided to get myself a street legal bike to play around on. I already have a shopping list of mods and parts I will be buying over the next few months so I will most likely post another picture later of when its finally done.  I can give a list of what I plan to do if anyone is interested or would like to give there opinion on it.  And for anyone else interested this is my dirtscoot
supermoto,33lcf4,pwnedbygary,4,Thu Apr 23 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"I already have a shopping list of mods and parts I will be buying    if you have any questions about the mods for this bike, feel free to ask me. I had one and did almost everything you can do to it, myself."

supermoto,33lcf4,jeski,5,Thu Apr 23 14:12:14 2015 UTC,So here is a general list in the order I plan to do to it over the next few months.  -Edge tail light(smoked) ~ ordered  -Edge 601 turn signals(smoked) ~ ordered  -Zeta quick turn throttle ~ ordered  -Renthal Kevlar Half waffle ~ ordered  -Zeta rubber killers ~ ordered  -Powermadd Mirrors ~ ordered  -Zeta Handgaurds(with turn signals) ~ ordered  -Acerbis Supermoto Fender ~ ordered  -3x3 mod  -fcr39 carb kit(from TT)  -Yoshimura RS-2 Carbon Exhaust  -K&N air filter  The 4 mods above I will do all at once.   I want to make this look and feel as much like a dirtbike as possible reason behind the new lights etc.  I later plan to get new rims (warp 9?) and graphics kit. I would like to go with a more red/black theme to this bike. I am a honda fan so I love my red :P
supermoto,33lcf4,Populoner,2,Thu Apr 23 14:24:01 2015 UTC,We have similar tastes! The RS-2 is an awesome addition to the drz.  http://i.imgur.com/XaoSoAK.jpg
supermoto,33lcf4,RyanTally,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:35:34 2015 UTC,Yes! I love the carbon look and the sound of the Yoshi. I cant wait to order it and put it on. The stock drz exhaust sounds so lame lol
supermoto,33lcf4,RyanTally,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah I'm trying to get away from the stock colors too, but as far as I've gotten is just swapping out that front fender with a black one, that Acerbis supermoto one. That edge tail light looks sweet too, proabably going to be my next buy, until I can collect some funds for the more expensive stuff, the stock light setup is just goofy"
supermoto,33lcf4,RyanTally,2,Thu Apr 23 14:39:43 2015 UTC,Yea I bought the look changing parts first since they were cheaper than the performance parts. Plus I think it will be good to get use to the bike and ride it stock since this is my first street legal bike. Then I will get the performance parts.  I honestly dont mind the front number plate/light to much. If I was to get something different I would most likely go with the cyclops headlight.
supermoto,33lcf4,Motocid,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:50:55 2015 UTC,Zeta Handgaurds(with turn signals)   Where did you order these from?
supermoto,33lcf4,fastonaslowbike,1 point,Thu Apr 23 14:57:54 2015 UTC,Found a video of a modded drz400 and it was built by this company soloracer  Costs an extra $37 for the lights.  They have kits for all the mods they did. There is also other sites that sell these zeta handguards with the turn signals.
supermoto,33lcf4,crenstro,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for link, they make it easy, little pricey but seamless packages."
supermoto,33lcf4,anarchist27,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:09:14 2015 UTC,I compared there prices around and some of there kits are actually cheaper if you add up everything in each kit to elsewhere separately.
supermoto,33lcf4,anarchist27,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:23:52 2015 UTC,True.
supermoto,33lcf4,crenstro,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:35:09 2015 UTC,"How long do you plan to wait before getting the exhaust/carb/3x3? I know that's a >$1000 purchase right there so you might be waiting out on it, but I would recommend getting the jet kit and doing the 3x3 asap. It's fairly cheap and makes a HUGE difference in power and sound, even when you're running stock exhaust. Then when you finally do get the new exhaust and fcr, you don't need to worry about changing the jetting on the old carb"
supermoto,33lcf4,crenstro,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:40:55 2015 UTC,It will most likely be by like mid May is when i plan to buy the full exhaust/fcr/3x3. I really am considering doing the 3x3 + jetting now. I will see in the next few days here.
supermoto,33lcf4,radsupermoto,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:06:04 2015 UTC,Make sure you get the full exhaust and not just the pipe

supermoto,33lcf4,RyanTally,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:04:22 2015 UTC,"If you do go for the MRD pipe, you can specify a 10 inch shorty silencer instead of 12. Looks badass."

Oh and check out the MRD Z-Pro before committing to the Yosh... I've had both the Yosh and MRD Z-Pro (formerly MRD/SSW), and the MRD sounds better and allows for more power output with extra mods when you're ready to do them... Just sayin.  And why new rims?? The stock excels are stronger and way more expensive than Warp 9's.... If you want to do any kind of wheel upgrade then get marchesini's."
supermoto,33lcf4,moto4life611,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry yes ment the fcr39 wrote that wrong. This one from thumper talk  I see this argument alot about the mrd/ssw pipe vs yoshi. Some say yoshi while others (alot) say mrd/ssw. Coming from my motocross background I guess I have a biased on the yoshi and just love the carbon fiber. But a post farther down someone said you can get the mrd/ssw with a shorter pipe? If so I would buy that over the yoshi in a heart beat. I hate how far out the exhaust sticks from the rear end, it looks ugly lol.  I still have no idea what I want to do with rims, I just am not a fan of the gold."
supermoto,33lcf4,RyanTally,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:27:44 2015 UTC,"yeah you can get a short version. check out their website, MRD Racing, the owner dave is a cool guy and all the pipes are made by hand.  Powdercoat those rims before you buy a set."
supermoto,33lcf4,moto4life611,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:47:17 2015 UTC,"I dont see anywhere on the site about getting a shorter version of the exhaust? Would I have to email him about that?  Also what type of heat shields is there for the mrd/ssw pipe? It does not seem to come with one but I could get the tabs to use the stock one. Exhaust wrap might give it a cool look as well, but I have never used the wrap before on any bike.  Also I guess I never thought about sending my rims off to be powdercoated. I am in Maryland so I will need to look around for pricing."

supermoto,33k434,Ronix523,6,Thu Apr 23 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"So a week ago I posted a pic showing a bike I was promised was mine. The guy seemed excited to sell it to me, however two days before we were gonna meet he sent me a text saying ""sorry some family things came up and I can't meet this weekend"". I told him it was fine and we could meet up whenever he's available. I then gave him a few days to do his thing, and then earlier this week I txted him a few times and tried calling him. He never responded to my txts or calls and now he has taken the bike off craigslist. My guess is he sold it from under me.... I'm pretty upset since I was so excited to be one of you guys :("

After the fact I heard they are actually really good bikes. Im looking for something that has enough power to wheelie and ride like a hooligan, while being able to keep up with sport bikes at the same time."
supermoto,33k434,Vital_Cobra,2,Thu Apr 23 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, having come from a DRZ400 with Big bore, full exhaust, flat slide pumper carb and hotcams stage 2, I can say it IS down on power by a decent bit, but the fuel injection and the smoothness and reliability of the startups make it SO worth the little less power. The WR is about 20 or so pounds lighter which does make a difference. I feel like down low, the torque is definitely a lot less, but the top end power is really similar to the DRZ. It also has 6 gears and is a LOT or seems to be a lot more tame and highway minded in supermoto form. Itll cruise at 75 all day if you have the stock 13/42T sprockets. I plan on doing +3T in the rear eventually because while it CAN wheelie, you have to work at it more than the DRZ which would power wheelie in 1st, 2nd and 3rd (only with the big bore and all the mods, stock DRZ's are pigs... and those mods total well over $1500) so far ive done: AIS Delete, EXUP removal, Flapper removal and removed a bunch of useless stuff from the WR and put on an edge2 fender eliminator/tail light, K&N filter, as well as an FMF slip on (powerbomb header, and FMF tuner are in the mail) It has plenty of pep for hooning around, and wheelies easy enough in 1st without clutch and 2nd with a slight blip. Im not gonna dissuade you from the DRZ which is an AMAZING bike, but I think honestly the WR with its FI, FULLY adjustable suspension (the DRZ's sorely lacks in this dept) and newer technology, it really makes up for the power difference. Also, there are big bore kits for the WR which bring it up to 280-290 and while they are hard to get perfectly tuned, they still make north of 35HP or so which is amazing. You'd need a turbo kit from MPfab to get it over 43HP."
supermoto,33k434,pwnedbygary,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:38:35 2015 UTC,"im guessing its still not easy to pop a mono on the WR250X right?. my brother has a KLX250S sumo bored all the way out to 330 with new carb jets and, bigger header and WR450 exhaust pipe. When I try and pop monos on that I notice you need to be in the high revs and you have to work it with your body and the suspension otherwise you wont go anywhere. by comparison I commute on a shitty old XL600RMG and although you can only pop monos in first gear it takes no effort and you can start at 3k rpm."
supermoto,33k434,Towelie62,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:39:05 2015 UTC,"Its all in the gearing on these. Shorter gears, i.e. 13/45T will pop easily because they rev up to the high end of the powerband easier when clutching. The DRZ is no monster, but it will power wheelie easier when fully modded. Clutch ups are safer and more controllable though, imo."

Get to know what your like and don't like about it and work from there.  Obviously it's different from an R1 so don't try and compare them too much. These bikes are made for the twisty roads, not drag races.   As to your question, the full akro system (as opposed to just the back box), aftermarket air filter and axel sliders are the only things that come to mind unless you want to mess with the engine with uprated cams etc?

supermoto,33guus,E-Step,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"I had a motard for about a year, similar to the 690, was immense fun on road. I didn't do much, if any, off road. So, my answer is a guess, but if you have sports tyres, it's going to slide a lot and the rims are going to be rather prone to buckling if you do big jumps and hit rocks and stones at speed. This is due to the fact that they are wider than dirt rims. They also won't ride over technical obstacles, as well as dirt wheels, because of them being 17's. Don't be scared of the dirt though, be gentle, ride it like a dirt bike and you'll be fine. :) I'm jealous..."
supermoto,33guus,crayons610,2,Wed Apr 22 16:17:33 2015 UTC,It's also worth mentioning that the larger disk on the front on the SMC isn't ideal for offroading and will easily get bent due to the lack of clearance of rocks etc.

My ktm 500 exc is actually recommend by akrapovic to use the stock headers because they are all ready titanium. As for air filters they are still going to plug into the same 2 inch inlet. So stock filter will be fine. As for the muffler get it tuned for the air fuel mixture. I also recommend a license plate eliminator they look for clean from behind:)"
supermoto,33guus,stiple,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"How do you like your 500 ? What's in like on the highway ? Rideable, dangerous or just manageable ? I'm looking into getting one. Weekday city commuting as a sumo and then a 100km run up to the trails on knobbies on the weekend. That sound doable ? Thanks."
supermoto,33guus,stiple,2,Wed Apr 22 17:10:26 2015 UTC,I like it a lot. They dont lie about high maintenance though. I spend the same amount on oil as I do gas... On the highway it's good up to 75 mph then it gets dangerous. Mine is an enduro though with Pirelli scorpion trails on it since I do mostly street use. can't afford sumo set up yet. You can do a 1 day trip like that. Just be ready and energized because the 100km commute will drain you with off road tires. To be honest it shines on a local commute. Most fun I ever had. Anything more than 20 miles gets annoying. 1 day runs are possible though. Hope I helped you out:) feel free to ask me more questions.

Probably the best of both worlds.   If you have a problem with it... THEN do a mod.  If you just want to spend money, grab some nice levers, like an RSC clutch lever, or something like that.

supermoto,33deaq,huzzaboot,8,Tue Apr 21 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well, i'd imagine the Sumo could be carrying a lot more corner speed but lets be honest, its not going to hold a candle to the acceleration of a superbike. Perhaps thats why the track is different for each."
supermoto,33deaq,from_dust,4,Tue Apr 21 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"The acceleration is comparable up to about 60~70mph, but then the wind is going to start catching up with the sumo."

supermoto,33deaq,jman4220,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"Hate to sound like a nob, but I understand the idea of backing it in. I can haul ass and when I get to a corner, I slam back break get into a slid, down shift and accelerate. It looks like what these guys are doing. So, my question is are these guys power sliding or backing it in? Or are they the same thing?"
supermoto,33deaq,killmekillmekillmeki,3,Tue Apr 21 21:27:08 2015 UTC,"Powersliding is having the back tire break free by opening up the throttle, which would happen during the exit of a turn.  ""Backing it in"" is downshifting and letting the clutch out fast to force the tire to break free, allowing you to swing the back tire out and take a faster line through the corner. That happens during entry into the turn.  Note: you could ""back it in"" and then turn that into a powerslide. Once the tire breaks free, it's relatively easy to keep it that way."

It was a ton of fun, but super sketchy cornering. With the wet noodle you have for front forks I would really recommend doing springs and revalving if not going to an inverted fork.

supermoto,32x0xa,BroncoFreestyle,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:22:50 2015 UTC,I considered a few ktms but I really want fuel injection and I don't think any bikes are as light weight as the new wr. I've herd people say that unless you're racing you can go 1000 miles between oil changes. Considering how cheap/easy a wr is to rebuild I don't know why I'm really so worried
supermoto,32zlmi,byebye247,4,Sat Apr 18 01:41:23 2015 UTC,DRZ or WR250X would be great.

supermoto,32zlmi,jman4220,1 point,Sat Apr 18 08:16:44 2015 UTC,I've never ridden a drz but I've heard theyre both pretty equal on the highway since the wr is a 6 speed. I'd say it starts getting revvy around 75 on my wr.

supermoto,32zlmi,CharlesFrancisX,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"The wr450 will need more maintenance than a drz400. The DRZ would be cheaper than a wr450, but I would still go with a wr250x if I had the choice. The DRZ is not much faster than the wr250x if that was your concern."

supermoto,32zlmi,stolenmoto,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:55:23 2015 UTC,Pah wr450 have fairly low maintenance. Sure the factory says you need check the valves every 1000miles but most people don't adjust them till they are well past 5k

supermoto,32zlmi,stolenmoto,2,Sat Apr 18 12:48:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe because you're comparing a 400 to a 250?  Even at that comparison the 250 isn't far off.  If you want to over pay for a generic outdated bike though, that's on you brah."

supermoto,3305ff,reppinthe509,3,Sat Apr 18 05:21:59 2015 UTC,The most important question is what are you using it for? If I was doing lots of long range avd rides I would go wr250x but if you are just hooning around town you have plenty of options
supermoto,3305ff,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:56:00 2015 UTC,"Probably both. I never got too adventurous on my drz but I did do some fun stuff.  I know they're not maintenance heavy, but the maintenance is costly. Like you need KTM specific oil and filter so it ends up being a $120 oil change instead of a typical $20-30 oil change  Edit: I just realized you didn't post the second part."
supermoto,3305ff,SenorTylerDurden,4,Sat Apr 18 07:10:32 2015 UTC,"Damn, get a wr450. Parts are cheap,rebuilds are cheap, sure you need to change the oil every 5 to 700 miles but it takes least than 30 minutes to do."
supermoto,3305ff,Lov-struk-repair-man,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:38:44 2015 UTC,Does it really need an oil change after only 700 miles?
supermoto,3305ff,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:36:19 2015 UTC,I would say so it only has a 1l  capacity. If I was super motivated I would send my oil of to get tested and check
supermoto,3305ff,Kief_Chief,5,Mon Apr 20 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"That oil change price is exaggerated. Motorex is the ""recommended"" brand of oil (~$70 for 5 quarts). Realistically you are using 1.5 - 2 qts per change so that's around $35. If your bike has a single filter, you're looking at ~$10. Double that if your bike has 2 filters. So anywhere from $40 - $50 dollars per oil change. Not cheap but not quite what you've stated. Also, if you use different oil your cost per change will be substantially less."
supermoto,3305ff,SumoSect,2,Sat Apr 18 12:58:22 2015 UTC,Ktm 500 rider here. 15-50 belray. 1.5 liters about 12$. K/n oil filter $6.99. Every 500 or 10-15 hours. It's not terribly expensive. Any heavy duty applications I switch to 10w-60motorex

supermoto,3305ff,Glockamolee,2,Sat Apr 18 06:27:02 2015 UTC,"Drz is more powerful but the wr is lighter so they end up being pretty similar. The myths about ktms being maintenance heavy doesn't really apply anymore, as far as I can tell it was only a problem 10-15 years ago. Don't let anyone scare you out of getting the bike you want because of things they've heard from a friend of a friend, of a friend."
supermoto,3305ff,SweetChilliPhilly,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:58:33 2015 UTC,I have a ktm after 500 miles you can tell it needs an oil change. It's a 2014 exc 500.
supermoto,3305ff,ratatooie,3,Sat Apr 18 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"Thats for that model maybe. Ktm 690 enduros oil change interval is about 5,000 which is about the same as a drz400."
supermoto,3305ff,SweetChilliPhilly,1 point,Sat Apr 18 07:16:13 2015 UTC,Do you really go 5k miles between oil changes on your DRZ? I'm wary of going anything over 2k and usually do 1.5k changes.
supermoto,3305ff,SweetChilliPhilly,2,Sat Apr 18 07:25:42 2015 UTC,"I meant kilometers by the way. And personally, I just change mine every 3 months because I don't ride it anywhere near enough.

You need to change the oil basically every 30 hours and clean the air filter pretty much every week. I only use mine for off road. Apart from that you dont need Ktm specific oil, motorex is a large sponsor of ktm bikes so its always recommended  you use motorex. But i hate motorex the oil is overpriced and too light. I find motul works best. Honestly it will demolish any other dirt/sumo bike out there."

I went looked the crf over and refused his trade offer and just offered him cash. Its an 07 CRF450R. Someone has thrown a lot of money at this bike in the past. It was sitting for 3 years in his garage with the old fuel in it...ughh. We tried to get it started at his place but it was pissing fuel out the overflow(needle and seat).

supermoto,32umcg,shotdoubleshot,4,Thu Apr 16 21:07:29 2015 UTC,How did you come to the conclusion that you want a kx?  Most straight up motocross bikes don't have great gear ratios for street use.  Trail and enduro bikes have better ratios like the WR450F and DRZ400.  They also have lights to begin with so they're easier to register them for the street.  It will be more work to set up a motocross bike with lights.  KTM 450/525/530/500 EXC have a 6 speed tranny.
supermoto,32umcg,prawnzz,3,Thu Apr 16 22:42:49 2015 UTC,Good advice here ^  MX bikes aren't really the best option unless you want pretty much exclusively track use.

supermoto,32spty,kioshimaru,7,Thu Apr 16 12:19:34 2015 UTC,If you live in Europe you should get a KTM or husky or one of the other many awesome bikes. And not a slow DRZ...  It's like the KLR of supermotos. It does everything ok but nothing great.  Not saying DRZs are bad but you have a lot of good choices in Europe.
supermoto,32spty,hyperduc,2,Thu Apr 16 13:25:15 2015 UTC,The drz is certainly fast enough to get yourself in a lot of trouble.  The main reason drz's are great is because they are built like a tank. They require only the most minimal maintenance. Parts are cheap and plentiful.

supermoto,32spty,slotard,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"To get to the same level (or close) you'd need wheels/tires, brakes (4pot front), suspension. Luckily my WR450 is already set up with those on it."
supermoto,32spty,ratatooie,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"Hm interesting choice!  I own both (well I own the 640, which is the predecessor of the 690) and have ridden the 690 recently. I love both and would be happy with either if I had to choose.   The DRZ is slower and feels a bit more bulky and hesitant (but easier to flick, which is a strange dichotomy). But, it's still such fun. You only really feel it getting breathless at around the 70-80 mark before it climbs to its just shy of a ton max speed. That said, you don't really ride these kinds of bikes at those speeds anyway. It's also a modder's paradise with a huge amount of aftermarket support.   The 640 is similarly brilliant, a tad heavier feeling, more immediate and faster and gets there quicker. Tops out for me at 117 (which was fast enough!). Similarly there is a decent amount of aftermarket stuff, but not near as much. Akros are a must. The 640 for me has been a much bigger pain in the arse to set up properly. The LC4 engine sounds like a bag of bolts but this is normal. The DRZ is arguably more reliable and less demanding on maintenance.  Both bikes would benefit from a 6th gear and FI, and this is where the 690 comes in. It has both and is so so good for it. It is in a different league from the other two (and will be my next bike as soon as I scrape the pennies together!) It is quicker, lighter and more poised than its predecessor. The only thing to watch is 1st and 2nd gear at low speeds - the fueling is very jerky and you have to feather the clutch a lot more than the other two, but this could have been ironed out (the 690 I rode was an '09)."

supermoto,32q2rj,SantiagoGT,2,Wed Apr 15 20:18:36 2015 UTC,$4k??!! What is in this conversion? A whole new bike? I thought a supermoto was just diferent wheels and suspension. I would want to know if there are any tricks to stiffen up a stock suspension without buying a new one or what's the cheapest way to do it. I have a xr650l with wheels and pipe but I still have way too much dive in my forks. Is there a cheap way to stiffen them?
supermoto,32q2rj,kickinit1,2,Wed Apr 15 22:38:03 2015 UTC,Get stiffer springs for your forks.

supermoto,32q2rj,BickNlinko,2,Wed Apr 15 23:18:59 2015 UTC,"Heres what you want for a supermoto race bike, and most of it can be had used in good shape for a good price. Be advised that at least in my area you can buy a properly set up race bike for 4k or less. You need big brakes (caliper, master, rotor) 16.5"" front wheel 17x5"" rear wheel (you cannot reuse the spokes from your dirt wheels, just buy a used set of wheels), slipper clutch, suspension set up for supermoto and your weight and ability level, slicks. What you want in addition to that stuff is sliders for your wheels, a catch can for your carb and radiator,  aluminum hand guards and some saftey wired parts.  Where do you live? I may be able to help you find parts or a bike, Im a fairly active supermoto racer and people are always selling shit."

supermoto,32oe77,bunBpimpC,2,Wed Apr 15 12:25:15 2015 UTC,"Pros: not a drz  Cons: you won't have any sweet comebacks for people ragging on your DRZ.  Looks solid, price seems reasonable."

It depends on your intended riding but yes, this would most likely be way better than a DRZ.  And I don't know about DRZ prices there but they are so inflated here I feel sorry for buyers."
supermoto,32oe77,hyperduc,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  You can get a DRZ in MN for probably a good 1000 less than this, maybe even a bit more.  I did however test ride a new DRZ and found it pretty gutless, hence why I'm looking at this.  It does come with the dirt wheels, and MN you can plate pretty easily.  No problems with it being carb'd over the newer fuel injected WRs?"
supermoto,32oe77,hyperduc,2,Wed Apr 15 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"For 1k more I would buy the WR.  Yes, the DRZ is gutless but reliable.  It's been around in the same shape for a while now.  Sounds like you should go for it.  Go see him in person (not over the phone) and make him an offer with cash in hand.  Up until now he has probably just heard from a bunch of douches calling him over the phone and offering a lowball offer they still don't even have.  You should ride it and see if it's better than the DRZ in your seat of the pants opinion.   The dirt wheels are a nice bonus. I like the factory ODO. The WR is going to take a little more maintenance than the DRZ but nothing like 'race' bikes. Anyone can change out plastics but it looks clean from here.  Not abused off road first.   Well, fuel injection is almost always going to be superior... but the carb is not going to cause problems.  Does your gas have tons of ethanol too?  Drain the carb if it sits for more than a few weeks and it will start like new every time.  That's what I do at the end of a day riding.  Out here in CA since the temp is fairly stable I find newer single cylinder motorcycle carbs on a high end bike (like the FCR MX, etc) is very very close to as good.  Once you get it dialed in, there shouldn't be any throttle lag or hesitation.  And it is simpler and more reliable.  No fuel pumps or filters to deal with.  Some advantages to EFI is no choke when cold or on start up and it pretty much takes care of tuning, and the mileage is better.  You will need to move to a much newer year to get it though, so it will cost a lot more.  For street I prefer EFI but for single cylinder dirt I think carbs are adequate.  This is a little of both..."

supermoto,32m1h5,somaganjika,2,Wed Apr 15 00:31:41 2015 UTC,YES! I'm rejoicing. It is awesome that you got it back.  Contact any lawyers your family or friends have ties to.  Take extensive pictures of the bike.  Have the damage estimated by a few dealerships (higher estimate).  Keep receipts. Keep track of your time put into all this.  Keep track of mileage put into this. Your friend charged you $300 to pick up the bike with his truck? Get an affidavit from him.  It's probably better if you don't even touch the bike until professionals look at it.  It will take like a year before you go to court.  Do you have to take time from work to meet with the lawyer?

However the amount of money you'll spend on the raw material and the amount of r and d time probably won't be worth it compared to buying one, or even buying a whole used big brake setup for that bike. Every non SMR KTM big brake setup from 2004 to current(I think, double check but at least up to 2012) will fit on your bike. That's one of the nice things about KTM. Im pretty sure that even the big caliper from the 625/640 will fit, as they use the same 48mm forks with the same bottoms. I just borrowed the caliper and master of my buddies 2012 450 sx-f for my 04 250sx because I was having brake problems"

Also talked to the brosef and hes very much in agreement about raw materials and labor costs. Estimated it around $150 anyway  Thanks for the advice

supermoto,32msfy,Quantis_Ottawa,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"It's alright if you like boat anchors.  Seriously though, mine has plenty of grunt and it's good for cruising and riding around the city as a commuter but if you like to ride it hard on the tarmac or off-road like I do you'll find it lacking compared to high-capacity enduro bikes like the 525exc, which you can rev the shit out and throw around of but have a maintenance cost. However, for a daily rider it's perfect - low maintenance, parts are extensive and cheap to come by, lots of torque, and really easy to ride.  At low speeds it's definitely top heavy - it's the first bike I've actually dropped on the street because I underestimated the centre of gravity on it.  I also managed to ride it into a dam, and it came out fine after a few oil changes, which I suppose is a good point if you like to leave the tracks and ride straight through the bush like I have a habit of doing.  Good Points:   Practically invincible Low maintenance Cheap and easy to get parts lots of torque and low end grunt easy to ride   Bad Points:   It's heavy High centre of gravity = more chance of dropping it Limited off-roading ability Not really suitable for those who ride hard Needs aftermarket parts to get the best out of it"

supermoto,32i761,buttrapinpirate,2,Tue Apr 14 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"would be looking more around mid 4000's for the bike, although that is a bit biased as I have only ever brought private and never dealer, but I would still say low 5k is maybe a little high for a 12,000km bike considering it is not a high mileage engine. In terms of highway stretches, you should have no problem with 15-20 miles at those speeds. the SM and SMR series have fair good gearing and ability to do those speeds, coming from riding even just a 450SMR, which could change into 2nd at 50mph if I really pushed it. It's a shame that SM's dont really like highway speeds with the engine strain and the wind buffering and all the rest, but you should be okay. 8k miles per year sounds like a fair amount (average 150 per week) but once again it is an SM rather than a conversion and might be a little better at dealing with this."
supermoto,32i761,vanillagueriller,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:04:54 2015 UTC,Good info... And yeah the bike is rare for sure in San Diego so I can see the price being what it is. Its actually 4500 plus tax and whatnot. Around 4900. Would having a lower tooth sprocket in the rear benefit me by running at lower RPM's at higher speed?
supermoto,32i761,Pondez,2,Tue Apr 14 23:21:31 2015 UTC,Is the cam chain been replaced or atleast checked? The 610 sm is quite know to break the cam chain somewhere around 10 000 km. I had it replaced around 12 000 km on my bike.

supermoto,32i761,Marbro_za,2,Tue Apr 14 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"cant help on the price, but  i bought mine (06) about mid jan? and been using it as a daily since. I do about 110km a day, to and from. With some long stretches and some twisties, I do tend to go towards the twisties more because my fatass (160kg's) limits the bike to about 145km, She still has rev's spare, but alas she just cant use em  The seats hard, the bike vibrates, fuel consumption could be better and the dash will break on you.   If you are willing to live with those things, Go for it, From my side, i wouldnt trade my baby for the world.  Also, dont expect cheap running costs. Timing chain needs to be replaced more regularly than the other bikes and parts are a little more expensive i think"

I think I'm okay with the costs of this bike, I know I'm not going to be owning an old XR650 or something, but I'll have a lot more fun, and I'm willing to pay for that.

supermoto,32g4x3,TrinkenDerKoolAid,7,Mon Apr 13 15:02:01 2015 UTC,Put an hour meter on it and change the oil at how many hours you normally would at the track.
supermoto,32g4x3,BickNlinko,2,Mon Apr 13 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"Watch the valves, change the oil regularly and you should be good. After you get a sense of how much the valves like to move, you can go to a less aggressive inspection interval."
supermoto,32g4x3,huzzaboot,2,Mon Apr 13 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"If it really takes half a liter, that isn't much.  My EXC takes 1.5 liters.

supermoto,32g4x3,SeanyeWest,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:28:30 2015 UTC,How is ss an improvement over titanium?
supermoto,32g4x3,eurofra1d,2,Wed Apr 15 18:51:13 2015 UTC,Titanium while lighter is a softer metal and as a valve it stretches more quickly than an stainless steel valve does which leads to frequent service intervals and shim adjustments.  So this cuts down on service requirements and improves longevity. technically there is a performance hit but from my research the impact is negligible.

supermoto,321y9g,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:12:27 2015 UTC,If you don't mind saying. How much did it cost to convert the bike to a sm? I have a 09 kx that I'm thinking of converting
supermoto,321y9g,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:24:36 2015 UTC,"You can do it pretty minimally for around $1500, but I wanted suspension, an HID headlight, and a few other upgrades over a simple conversion.  This was where I initially started looking at components. However, I determined that I could put a kit together, with better components, for around the same money. Utilizing the stock hubs for my SM wheels allowed me to keep the stock speedo, which is able to be calibrated for any wheel/tire size."
supermoto,321y9g,SenorTylerDurden,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:53:49 2015 UTC,Any reason you went wuth yamaha hubs specifically? Is this strictly a supermoto out do you occasionally convert it back to dirt?
supermoto,321y9g,RyanTally,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:02:32 2015 UTC,"I wanted to utilize the stock speedo, and don't really plan on converting it back to dirt. It's valved and sprung for the street, so it would likely be too stiff for full dirt duty."

I have yet to ride the Ducati but it is the cats ass from what I've seen. Since both are 0km bikes, I would go Aprilia. Sure that particular model isn't around any more but 3000 euro will go a long way towards maintenance and accessories. My buddies bike only required a new map sensor in the 16000km the bike has it(other than oil changes etc). Btw that sensor can be found under a gm part number to save time and expense."

If you're average size it's comfortable enough on long rides, but the Hyperstrada seat makes it even better. Wind blast is a little annoying, but there's also a windscreen for it. The front suspension is a bit weak on the non-SP version, but beyond that I love it."

From your own links, the first is £516.31 and second is £594.08, both more or less in line with my prices new if we add on some ££ for shipping.   Second hand you can definitely get the full system for 500. The way that I know, is that that is what I did.  Your confusion is probably due to £ vs $ prices and conversion."
supermoto,31vui5,STFUDora,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:49:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem at all buddy. Truly, just can't figure out where your getting your prices from. The euro conversion makes since. No hard feelings. Just trying to clarify. In USD. A single slip on is 500 dollars. For a true dual its closer to 1k. In USD. That's all I was saying. My links show that. I don't know the conversion rate."

I recently bought a ktm 660 smc and will be riding it as soon as I legally can (age...). It does is a big difference. It has a lot more power and it is brute force. except from that I'm perfectly capable of riding it. I have to get used to the sumo riding type though cause I've always ridden supersports bikes.  the reason I mention what I'm capable of riding is because your riding is self though and I had a lot of lessons and a bit of experience. I think you will be able to handle the 610 if you take it easy at the beginning. Get used to the power! (I'm still getting used to it).

supermoto,31n7nh,asianrednek,5,Mon Apr 6 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"There are a few other aspects that needs considering for backing in, but to answer your primary question regarding the clutch, definitely do NOT dump it.  When approaching a corner, pull in the clutch, downshift to the gear you want at the exit, and modulate the rear-wheel speed with the clutch.  Letting the clutch out too fast will result in the wheel starting to ""hop"".  Solution, pull in the clutch a bit. Essentially, what you want is a rear-wheel that is spinning slower than the front, but not hopping or locking up, since that would cause a high-side eventually.  As i said, however, it's more a combination and by-product of speed than anything else.    In regards to your Slipper Clutch question, Check out this Wiki.  Generally, it acts like an automatic clutch in a way.  Set-up properly, you can just let out your clutch and it'll do the rest in regards to regulating the rear-wheel speed (No locking up or hopping if set up right).  Easy mode :P  Depending on where you live, there might be some SuperMoto schools around, which would be worth checking out.  If not, you can practice backing it in in a big open space, set up a turn after a long straight and keep doing the same run over and over, pushing the braking point further and further and practicing your clutch control and body position.  It's always easier when you have somebody watching that knows how to do it, though, so i'd definitely recommend a school.  Hope that helps.  Stay safe and have fun!"

supermoto,31n7nh,Rumbledog,2,Mon Apr 6 17:27:13 2015 UTC,"just want to stress the point made above..... it's more a combination and by-product of speed than anything else...... Doing it slowly on the street will cause you issues, high side and broken collar bone or wrist. Go to a track or big open car park with lots of run off room. Trying to do it in tight areas will make it harder and not as fluid."
supermoto,31n7nh,bug20k1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"Does this put excessive wear on the clutch as opposed to just braking down to a desired entry speed and accelerating out?   Alternatively, why should I use this method of slipping the clutch through the corner?"
supermoto,31n7nh,PenguinScotty,2,Fri Apr 10 06:02:20 2015 UTC,"Theoretically it puts more wear on the clutch, but there are a few things to consider in that regard.  First, it's a wet clutch, so wear is much less of an issue than with a regular dry clutch.  Still more wear, though. Second, If you were, theoretically, to brake as you would in road racing, then yes, it would make more sense to do ""one at a time"" and slowing yourself down gradually.  That said, it's not really possible in a supermoto sense, since the corners tend to be MUCH tighter than on a regular track, meaning much harder braking and accelerating, and much less ""flowy"" corners, if that makes sense.  You could ride supermoto as if on a road track, but you'll be much much slower. Think of supermoto like a go-kart vs a car, perhaps.  Don't slip it THROUGH the corner, but INTO the corner.  The reason for slipping the clutch into the corner is simply because you are approaching a very tight turn at a high rate of speed, which you will scrub off very quickly due to the great braking of a Supermoto, so you go down the gears very quickly.  Too quickly for the engine to keep up, so to keep from locking up the rear wheel and possibly highsiding, you slip the clutch.  Once you hit the Apex, though, you should be off the brakes and off the clutch and starting your acceleration.  Sorry, hope that makes some sense, it's a bit late."
supermoto,31n7nh,bug20k1,2,Fri Apr 10 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"no, that's a great explanation. My canyon riding isn't quite that aggressive to do this, but I'll try to practice it a little bit. I'll especially give it a try if I ever get to a track. Thank you!"
supermoto,31n7nh,jumph4x,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:56:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely slipping.   My personal technique is banging down 3 gears (at high speeds, 4 may be necessary) and slowly easing the clutch out while also feathering rear brake and counter steering/transitioning weight.  Before you start slipping the clutch, load the front with moderate/aggressive braking.   I ride a 2011 KTM 990 SMR."
supermoto,31n7nh,Marbro_za,3,Tue Apr 7 17:24:28 2015 UTC,4 gears??? that seems like a really big jump
supermoto,31n7nh,jumph4x,2,Thu Apr 9 10:17:31 2015 UTC,"4 gears??? that seems like a really big jump   It is. The mechanics are easy to visualize. The rear wheel needs to be just barely moving. As long as it keeps slipping very slowly, it will offtrack smoothly out and step back in smoothly as well. If it is locked statically, it will swing out aggressively and once you let go off brakes, it will jump back in-line aggressively.   Now you have a highside.   That and a large mis-match in gear velocities allows you a longer clutchslip opportunity time. Meaning with a small delta between gears, you only have a small amount of time between the rear wheel speed up and matches the speed of the drivetrain. The more gears you skip, the more careful your clutch moderation has to be, but also the longer you can make the rear wheel do the right dance.   Here is a video of me applying these tips. Nothing glorious, but you can see where I only skipped 2 gears it barely steps out at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCyntDNUYcM  Since the video is shot on a technical course, I only had opportunity to bang down 3 gears (think ~50mph corner entrance speed). On highway, if I want to show off, I tend to go closer to 60mph and bang down 4."

For me, it was a faulty kickstand sensor. I know that sounds stupid, but when I would ride quickly, the bumps in the road would mess with the sensor causing the bike to think the stand was down and shut itself off. Whenever I would pull over, the bike would start right back up.  I know a lot of supermoto guys disable or remove their stand sensor, so this might not even be a possible problem for you. If not, I hope whatever it is has a simple fix. Good luck."

If the revs are high and it's cutting out then probably not enough fuel is getting to the engine. Bigger main jet or switch out the needle or move it up a notch. Also doesn't hurt to give the carb a good service! Also check your fuel lines from the tank (I can't remember if the 660 is gravity or vacuum fed). Filter in the tank might be clogged too. Check it.  Air. Clean/replace filter.   Doesn't sound like an ignition or electrical issue, but it never hurts to check/replace the spark plug."
supermoto,31ghds,slotard,2,Sat Apr 4 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"The fuel problem is unlikely to be jetting, that's something you can tell right away.

supermoto,319677,EnduroRacer,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:10:41 2015 UTC,Ktm 690 if u want to hold those speeds . Conversion is put the 17 wheels on and a caliper relocation bracket if u go larger rotor. may need aftermarket speedo if wheels aren't compatible. A dr650 supermoto conversion would be a budget alternative. I have one (set up for dirt). its way better on the highway than my drz400

supermoto,3146jd,Tombosa,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:48:38 2015 UTC,Looks sill with those tiny little cans. Google the Husky SM 450RR and SM 530RR. They came with dual cans from the factory.
supermoto,3146jd,BickNlinko,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"2009 owner here. I've seen that pic before and always assumed it was a custom job. Aftermarket exhausts are really hard to find for these bikes. I know leo vince made a full titanium system(big $). And I'm pretty sure arrow made a slip on kit that was a dealer option. You can convert  it to a single though. Saves weight and less to worry about in a crash. Looks better too imo. If you get a stock midpipe from a te510, any aftermarket te510 slip on will bolt up. Midpipe bolts up to the smr no problem. Plus it gets rid of the cat. I plan on putting an fmf q4 on mine."

supermoto,312q7x,asphalt86,4,Wed Apr 1 16:38:44 2015 UTC,Depends on your mechanical skills I guess.  Could quickly turn into a money pit if the whole engine is shot.  Personally I'd factor in a new engine and maybe other parts since the bike has been abused most likely.
supermoto,312q7x,hisinfernalmajesty,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:28:50 2015 UTC,"And also parts can be quite difficult to find or expensive for Huskies. And it could just be the angle of the picture, but I don't see any front turn signals, and I definitely don't see any mirrors  You should bring a compression tester and then you can determine if the top end is shot.   If it isn't then it could very well be an easy fix, or a very difficult one. Next simple check you could do is run a screwdriver from the sparkplug wire to just a couple millimeters away from the engine case and see if you're getting spark. If you're getting spark, and you have compression, then it's likely an air/fuel issue.  All that being said, that is a pretty sweet price for a plated 450 in California, even with the engine issues. If compression is good offer him $1400, but I personally would probably pay up to about $1500."
supermoto,312q7x,MEGA__MAX,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:56:07 2015 UTC,"Isn't it hard to get a compression reading with the compression releases on most dirt bikes? But I agree, $1500 would be my happy price if I was buying."

supermoto,312q7x,snoopy3875,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:24:58 2015 UTC,Where I live that would probably be a $5000-$6000 bike if it ran.  We don't have a whole lot of huskys in northern CO but similar KTMs go for around the price I stated if they are in top shape.

supermoto,30xxte,kevan0317,3,Tue Mar 31 16:39:56 2015 UTC,"Couple of things:   Harder will be more jarring but take bigger hits   This is wrong. Harder compression damping will not let you take bigger hits. Harder compression damping makes the bike more responsive in transitions and makes the turn in sharper, at the cost of instability.    Each click makes a surprising amount of change on this system so go slow and make small adjustments.    Most stock suspensions don't actually offer that much adjustment range. Thats why for track, people switch to Ohlins that have more range and are much more precise. The reason why they limit the range is because they don't want the ""idiots"" cranking compression or rebound up and making the bike unstable. That doesn't mean that the adjustments are not worth while though.   Even before setting all the suspension stuff, the number one thing you should do if you want to mess with the suspension is get correct springs for your weight. If you are lightweight, stock springs should be fine, if you are heavier you need stiffer springs. Race tech website has a good calculator for both street and track. Having the correct rate will give you more confidence in the bike.   As for damping settings, for the front, put a zip tie around one of the lower fork legs that is tight but loose enough that it easily slides up and down. Slide it up high and go for the most aggressive ride you can. Then look at the position of the zip tie. Ideally,  you want it to end up around the midrange of the fork travel. If its too high, you compression is to hard, and if its too low, its too soft.   For rebound, set it in the middle or slightly soft of middle, and only soften it if you feel the front end walking over bumpy roads as you are leaned over.   For the shock, you really don't need to mess with rebound or compression from the center settings. Those really only matter if you are throttling hard out of the corner. Middle settings offer a good compromise between stability and responsiveness.   Overall, having the correct spring rate (and correct preload) on both ends  is key as it will prevent the rear from sagging out of sync with the front while you are taking a corner. The damping is really used for the stability of the bikes over bumps."
supermoto,30xxte,8kcab,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I will try to work this into the write-up and correct the compression damping bit.

supermoto,30xxte,8kcab,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Re: Zip ties  Coming from mountain bikes. While setting up suspension, ideally you want the travel indicator (zip tie) to reach full travel on a hard, vigorous ride. Otherwise, you are wasting travel.

Only down fall I can even fathom is maybe the weight. Other than that it:   makes substantial power for most riders great aftermarket support cheap to maintain factory street legal plenty of power producing mods damn near bulletproof/foolproof outstanding reliability low fuel consumption   I'm sure there is more that I'm missing. The pros out weigh the cons by far.  Unless a DRZ is directly liable for some freak occurance in your life, I can't see why you bash it so much. I'm sure many others couldn't agree with me more."
supermoto,30qgud,roger_podakter,-10,Mon Mar 30 11:34:22 2015 UTC,Don't be upset with me because you paid twice what a bike is worth just to be part of the club.  You live and learn bro.  Buy a KTM next time like a man and you won't be projecting your anger at others anymore.

supermoto,307vnh,BickNlinko,3,Wed Mar 25 04:19:27 2015 UTC,"I was going to say, those look exactly like the ones Sean Butterman made for his Husky. They're one-off and probably pretty valuable. Where did you get them? I know some people that would pay a lot of money for those around where I live."
supermoto,307vnh,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive that they're the same, just that they look very similar.   Someone on SMJ found them on Craigslist in Albuquerque, but they wouldn't fit his bike. He linked me, I emailed the guy, and convinced him to ship those (paid his asking + shipping, although he paid for them to be trued first because I wanted to make sure they were straight). That reminds me, I offered him a finder's fee and I ought to give that to him...  I didn't pay that much for them, less than a new set of DNA or Warp9. They aren't in perfect shape but they're pretty good.   The seller didn't seem to know what they were, he wasn't even sure they were tubeless. I think they're fairly old, they had slicks on them that were... 5? years old (don't quite remember, may have been older than that).   If I could get a set of Marchesinis for them I'd go for that, but I bought them intending on using them. Not sure whether I should use them as street or track wheels (the Excel rims on Talon hubs I have are 3.5f/4.25r, great shape, black, but they use tubes)."
supermoto,307vnh,BickNlinko,2,Wed Mar 25 05:56:51 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine that anyone else has machined up an identical set of wheels to Butterman's one off home made set. Maybe Butterman made them special order for someone.   Is the front 16.5"" or 17""? Also, having 5 year old slicks is not uncommon, I was racing on a 10 year old Maxxis at one point. Were the slicks slick or rain slicks? If the front is 16.5"" you can't use it on the street as you wont be able to find a suitable street tire for it.  No one is going to trade a set of $2500 Marchesinis for those rims, but they are definitely worth some cash.   I'll ask Butterman if he ever made a second set and sold them. He's from Albequerque NM."
supermoto,307vnh,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"They're 17s, but I had the guy get rid of the slicks before shipping them to me (to save on shipping). They were full slicks. I don't trust old tires, I had a crash that they may have contributed to that resulted in a nasty concussion and badly broken wrist.   I didn't figure I'd be able to trade them for Marchesinis, although I didn't think those were quite that expensive. I think these will be my street wheels, tubeless makes flat repairs much easier and cush drive is nice for the tranny.   I can't imagine this is the same set as the article, the ones in the article are different colors. He probably had a reasonable batch produced. I would be interested in hearing how many were made."
supermoto,307vnh,ashington,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"They are definitely not the ones off his race bike, as those are black and your's are both 17"". Being both 17"" maybe they were a set he whipped up for rains (which is why I asked about the slicks earlier ). I'm not sure how many him and his dad whipped up, but I can't imagine it was that many. I'll probably see him at round 1 of AMA Supermoto on the 4th.  Cush drive is definitely the way to go."
supermoto,307vnh,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:32:56 2015 UTC,"Mine appear to have hubs for Yamaha, as the bolt patterns are all the same as my stock stuff as far as I can tell. I don't imagine they're the same as the Husky pictured. Didn't know he was on 16.5s but I suppose that's not a big surprise.   I don't know about these rims but in many cases setup is a very significant cost at a machine shop, so making 10 sets is nowhere near double the cost of making 5."

For me it's much faster and more stable (this is on a fast road course). Haven't been on a slower cart type track yet, but I'd imagine foot out would be better for slower tighter turns like that.

If you are going foot down, it doesn't matter if the arse goes bye bye, just roll with it and slide. Plus you don't see dirt bikes go knee down."

You gonna tell these guys your fucked if you get the ass end loose and knee down is slow??  A SM is not a dirtbike, its not a sportbike. It's the greatest type of motorcycle ever created and it doesn't really matter how you ride it because it will make you smile unlike any other bike!

supermoto,2zzgfk,huzzaboot,3,Mon Mar 23 05:40:57 2015 UTC,But isn't that how it's supposed to work? At least for DRZ it is. All the things that will enable/disable starting are connected in series in DRZ circuit so all the contacts need to be closed for starting relay to activate.  http://www.thumpertalk.com/topic/597249-2008-drz-sm-wiring-diagram/
supermoto,2zzgfk,all1en,3,Mon Mar 23 08:16:53 2015 UTC,"You are correct. However, on a not-a-drz, the kill switch is in parallel to the ignition wire. Pushing the button shorts out the spark plug, preventing spark.   I'm not saying it's impossible to use this kill switch, but it requires some pretty invasive wiring."
supermoto,2zzgfk,all1en,2,Mon Mar 23 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Ok. But you could just add a relay that is controlled with this kill switch. It makes it just a little bit more complicated and if you use this switch it would still act like a 'safety circuit' because the relay would be activated in normal state. Idk, never done a dirt bike conversion."
supermoto,2zzgfk,awittygamertag,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"True, it just adds a lot more complexity/effort. Not impossible, just super annoying.  And particularly considering it's a kill switch, I'd prefer it be as simple/robust as possible."

If it's locked up, then you're going to need to pull the motor and really see what's going on by removing the side crank case covers/cylinder etc.   What I would do: If it was free dollars, Take everything apart. Chances are that you've got quite the project in front of you.   What NOT to do. Buy anything that converts it to a supermoto/tires/plastic/ANYTHING AESTHETIC until you have a bike that runs. I've helped a lot of people rebuild older bikes, and for some reason they always want to pretty it up before making sure it'll run."
supermoto,2zyw6n,ChrisPD06,2,Mon Mar 23 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"Little late to this thread, but I'm pretty sure that is a DR350(maybe 250?)  It'll make a great supermoto if you can get it running. This is my '96 DR 350 with 17"" GS 500 wheels:  Notice how the front wheel is backwards? Needed to put the disc on the other side. Works fine though. The speedo drive needed to be adapted to fit(hence it hanging off), and it actually reads over due to the ratio.  They weren't too much work to fit, I had to:  - Fabricate extension brackets for the brake calipers  - Get different bearings for the rear (the front fitted straight on the spindle)  - Turn spacers on a lathe (this was probably the most complicated part)  I took the old GS500 bearings and the DRs spindle to a bearing shop and they gave me the correct ones to fit the rim onto the spindle. It also needs a crush tube between the bearings, but that doesn't have to be perfect.  There were either 5 or 6 spacers, I can't remember(I can check if needed?), 2 at the front, and at the rear one either side of the caliper bracket, and one or two(not sure) on the cush hub/drive side.  If you need any more info you can PM me and I'll have a look.  That's only any good if you get it running! They're actually really easy to work on IMO, and there's loads of info available online. Hope that wall of text helps"

I've got a 690 SMC with a slip on and the evo 2 filter kit(no cam) and it is an animal compared to my buddies 690 sm that's mapped with slipons. Get yourself over to Supermotojunkie.com and post in the ktm section. This is full exhaust ( is on ebay now but since you had a 660 I assume your not in the states.   Get a tune ECU cable and read up on the mapping. I've got a 690sm map you can use if you need it. Every 690 needs to be mapped before they run right.   If you're on the hunt for more power after the exhaust I'd suggest throwing on the EVO 2 kit. (the duke one fits the SMC one will not) You can use the cam however you sacrifice a lot of mid range for about 4hp on top. I chose not to use it and sold the cam and I'm happy with that decision.   Definatly go -1 on the counter shaft sprocket. They're geared pretty high. And get yourself a Manual Cam chain tensioner(the KTM ones are known to fail).  If you haven't done it already replace the rocker arms and check the valve clearance. The rollers had bad metallurgy and go bad and will eat a top end if your not careful. KTM has since updated the part but still don't know if its 100% fixed. The part numbers are 75036061144 and 75036060144. While your in there pull out all the Secondary Air system, block it off and turn it off with Tune ECU.  Its going to be hard to get the 690 up to 660 power. The 660 is lighter and has a stronger but way less refined motor. You can get it close though once you get everything set up. Good luck! If you have any questions shoot me a message. I had a 625SMC and now  a 690 SMC!"

supermoto,2zluuq,rctaylors,3,Sat Mar 21 16:55:07 2015 UTC,RHC 187's are a perfect set of cams for a bored and stroked DRZ. You need more duration and overlap than the stock cams or even hotcams can provide due to the increase in swept cylinder volume.  Something like the Web 539/540 would also work but they have more lift than necessary. How many stroker motors have you built?

Tire pressure: 24 front and back is a good starting point Gas: 87, anything more and you're literally burning money, octane only increases the ignition temperature required to prevent knocking in high compression or turbo'd engines. back protector: This one riding tips: It'll be easier to tell you in person, but basically you'll want weight over the front, so don't sit too far back. Don't worry about getting your foot off until you feel you're scraping your toes or it feels more natural to do so.  You don't have to move your ass around as much on a sumo as you do a sportbike. Think dirtbike.   Some other things: We provide free water, but I usually bring a cliff bar or something similar to keep me going energy wise.  and the most important thing is to RELAX! don't try and be the fastest guy out there, just have fun riding at a comfortable level. There is a variety of levels of speed in the B group so there is always someone to putt around with."

See you out there in a few weeks!"
supermoto,2zixud,AllHailScience,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:16:29 2015 UTC,"For all street 23/25psi front/rear, check it again after the tires are warmed up if you're really worried.  Some people prefer to run it lower, like 21/22, but I think it starts to feel a little mushy then. Test it out and see what you like, that's what track days are for! For gas, you might as well put 93 in it if you're going to wail on it at the track.  If you can find a place that sells it without ethanol that is ideal and they usually have 97+ octane fuels, but I don't feel a difference because I'm already running super rich right now on my ktm.  Did you rejet for the yoshi pipe or do the 3x3 airbox mod? That's a drz thing right? Gear is always good, but I think the spine protector isn't necessary for a small street only course.  Do you have proper padded pants, jacket (that zips into the pants), boots, gloves?  You should be able to lay the bike down and slide for a bit if needed.  I started wearing an atlas neck brace too this season and really like it.  I hear leatt makes the best one, but I went the cheapo route.  I also safety wired my oil drain plug in place after a friend of mine had his back out and james bond oil slick his ass mid corner.  Takes 5 minutes and puts that worry out of my head.

My friend got crossed up in a muddy rut, hit the the tree and was thrown about 30 feet down an embankment resulting in a broken femur.  He was wearing full MX gear, and with myself and another rider there it still took EMS 2.5 hours to get him to an ambulance.

supermoto,2zcko9,HyperTraveler,5,Tue Mar 17 21:09:45 2015 UTC,"To me the deciding factor was the two-way capability.   On the Spot, you have a couple of levels of help available, but you hit a button, and hope that someone heard it.  Even if it's you just snapped your chain on a remote highway in New Mexico, you still don't know if/when anyone gets the message, or how long you'll be waiting.  With the InReach, your buddy, family member, emergency dispatch, can say, hey, got the message, give you an ETA, etc.  I imagine in some settings, you could even ask for some medical advice if necessary while waiting for paramedics.  To me, the whole knowing thing made it worth a little more."
supermoto,2zcko9,The__RIAA,1 point,Tue Mar 17 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  I was checking out their site.  Seems pretty cool.  I'm curious what subscription plan you use and how often you ride where it's important to have.  Most of my rides are with other people or road rides near civilization but I'd like to do a Trans-Labrador and also a Prudhoe Bay, AK trip in the near future that will probably be solo trips.    Thanks for the info so far!"
supermoto,2zcko9,HyperTraveler,2,Tue Mar 17 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"I do the cheapest of the plans that also gives me the option of putting the account on pause.  I figured that it's rare for me to hit the trails when it gets hot here.  I also don't need the continuous tracking, but if I was heading to Deadhorse solo, I'd just subscribe to a plan that gives me free unlimited tracking.  Mainly because if you're unconscious, you can't really call for help, but if you don't check in, or someone noticed that you haven't moved for a long time, they can page you, or call for help.  Hopefully before you get eaten by a bear.  I think for us solo riders, it's probably the cheapest insurance going.  I'd give some thought to contacts as well.  Make sure you have some people you can contact for non-emergency issues as well, that at least have enough basic idea of how to help you, whether it's finding a shop, forum member, whoever can maybe help you out."

I personally went with a larger aftermarket skid plate in carbon fiber to protect the important parts when I go down. That combined with the CFC case covers give me a little piece of mind.

supermoto,2z547i,slotard,3,Sun Mar 15 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"They do on paper.  But random issues come up a lot more often.  I have a 690smc (which is similar but not the same, of course).  Roughly speaking, I've had about the same amount of issues/costs on this bike in 10K miles as I've had on sportbikes that I ran to about 50K miles.  Other SMC owners I know personally report roughly same amount of problems.  In other words, if you're used to Japanese sportbikes, SMCs don't cut it.  If you're used to dirtbikes and doing your oil changes and engine rebuilds, SMCs are going to be a great relief.    This is why I would not use the bike as a commuter.  50km adds up very quickly."

supermoto,2z547i,SenorTylerDurden,2,Sun Mar 15 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"For some reason I thought the 690 was pretty much a whole new engine vs earlier LC4. I know they changed the side that the sprocket is on.   I had a 2004 625SMC for a year, and put 13000 miles on it. In that time I had a couple problems. The switch for the headlight melted, and had to be replaced. The base gasket started leaking, too.   I wouldn't buy another one for putting that many miles on it. I've heard the 660 is somewhat higher strung than the 625 was, too. I've been told the 690 is somewhat lower maintenance.   Coming from a CBR125, I'd look hard at a WR250X. They require extremely little maintenance, and should be fine for that sort of mileage."

supermoto,2z0qsz,Dweller,9,Sat Mar 14 14:20:10 2015 UTC,If you're doing 17s get a full street tire. Handling and braking will drastically improve over 21/18 combo. Drastically is also an understatement.

supermoto,2z0qsz,Ridethepig101,3,Sat Mar 14 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"I have 2 sets for my 450.  I have to run 2 chains because of my gearing ratio's being 14/45 on my 17's and 14/50 on my dirt wheels.  On my 17"" wheels I have a 320mm braking rotor, so I have a relocation bracket for my brake caliper that has to come off.  I used to run the same gear ratio's but I don't like having to abuse my clutch so much in tight woods with 14/45."
supermoto,2z0qsz,Dlichterman,3,Sat Mar 14 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"You'll want to do the oversize front rotor on your dirt wheels to make the swaps easier....and also improve the braking.  I run Pilot Powers on my SM wheels and full knobbies on my dirt set.  As for sprockets - 44(stock) on the dirt wheels, 41(stock for SM AFAIK) on my SM wheels. I do have to increase the chain slack but I can use the same chain for both."

supermoto,2ytl62,Mike709,2,Thu Mar 12 20:17:17 2015 UTC,Make it tubeless for like $50 and you won't ever worry about pinching tubes again.  You'll also trim some weight from the wheels.
supermoto,2ytl62,nemisis714,2,Thu Mar 12 20:59:12 2015 UTC,Try replacing a fifty tire by yourself. Hardest tire change ever. Use lots of soapy water an if you have a floor heater let the tire sit in front of it for a while to soften it up a bit. Grab a friend an extra pair of hands and feet help a lot. A decent pair of tire spoons is also recommended.
supermoto,2ytl62,Theredcrayola,2,Thu Mar 12 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"You can find some pretty helpful videos on YouTube. Basically, remove the wheel from the bike, remove valve core from tube, break the bead, lube up the tire/rim with some soapy water/Windex/This shit which is totally awesome, spoon off one side of the tire, remove tube, yank other side of the tire off, repeat the process in reverse to re-install. Remember to use lube, and remember to keep the opposite side of the tire you're spooning in the drop center of the rim. Make sure you align the light part of the tire(as marked with a red or yellow dot by the bead) with the valve stem. Also, after you get the tube in the tire, re-install the valve core and put a couple of PSI in the tube to keep you from getting a pinch flat. Once both sides of the tire are on the rim, pump that bitch up to like 60PSI to seat the bead.   A couple of things you'll need, in which to make the job way way way easier. A bead breaker, at least three decent tire spoons/irons, lube, valve core remover(I just use the valve stem caps with the removers on the top), pump or compressor and a second set of hands for spooning on that last little bit of tire. Remember to take little ""bites"" when you're getting close to having the tire all the way on there.   I've probably changed 50 tires on my supermoto bikes and not once needed to balance them, just line the dot up with the valve stem."

supermoto,2ysc7y,Deathwagon,2,Thu Mar 12 16:01:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that when air gets warm it expands. I want to say it is between 4 and 6 psi depending on ambient temps, but either way you are way over pressure.  Sport bike tires are designed to be run at 30 psi on a sport bike that weighs 400+ lbs, on a supermoto that weighs half that you cannot deform the tire enough to get a good contact patch, which will make your tires want to break free due to lower friction.  I personally run 18 psi cold which puts me at 24 psi hot, and most guys who ride track or even just spirited mountain riders will agree.  For commuting I run 22 psi cold because I want my tires to last longer."
supermoto,2ysc7y,ApexIsGangster,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"22 cold???? thats basically flat though, isnt it?  how big is this contact patch supposed to be?"
supermoto,2ysc7y,BickNlinko,2,Thu Mar 12 20:23:58 2015 UTC,I run right about 18-20 on my DRZ.  You'd be surprised how well you can ride with less air.  Try it out when you have time.  Air down to like 15 and take a trip to the grocery store or something.  Then air it up until you like the way it rides.  I'm WAY more comfortable riding with a low PSI like 15 than I am with 30.

supermoto,2yp9de,roger_podakter,1 point,Wed Mar 11 20:31:39 2015 UTC,I'd love to know what you sold it for?  Because the trend in the sumo market (that I've noticed in my area) is people trying to sell their bikes at double market value for no reason at all.  I don't think sumo owners understand the process of vehicle depreciation...
supermoto,2yp9de,roger_podakter,2,Wed Mar 11 20:21:30 2015 UTC,"I'm from Canada and yes the market can be ridiculous. But if you're on the selling side it's a benefit, if you think it's too high buy brand new.   The kid that bought it actually got lucky, I was just sick and tired of people just wanting to test ride a sumo so I gave him a smoking deal, even gave him an extra $100 off if he promised to take a picture on the bike while holding a DQ blizzard (long story)  I won't say the final price because the truth is, the price is whatever you're willing to pay for it. Capitalism Baby!!"
supermoto,2yp9de,BickNlinko,2,Wed Mar 11 20:38:55 2015 UTC,"It's fucking stupid and infuriating to be honest.  People legit think because they did work to the bike that I should pay for it.  If you do work to your car, it decreases the value.  If you don't use OEM parts, it decreases the value.  Why do supermoto  sellers feel they are exempt from this?  I'm about to just buy brand new because it's cheaper than some dickhead who thinks his 2002 drz400 with 10k miles is still worth 6 grand."
supermoto,2yp9de,roger_podakter,4,Wed Mar 11 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that the DRZ prices are pretty absurd, but for converted bikes I understand the mark up.   To properly convert a motocross bike to a supermoto bike takes a lot of money, however the conversion parts hold a lot of value even after the fact(except suspension upgrades). A set of new Excel wheels is over $1,000 plus tires, a good brake setup is over $1,000, a slipper clutch is ~$800 and suspension work is ~$500. You can get all that stuff used and put it on your bike, but its still going to cost you over two grand. If you're in California, that also isn't taking street legal converted bikes into consideration, as people will mark up their plated OHV bike a bunch, which I agree is a little bit absurd, but its a major pain in the ass/impossibility to plate a dirt bike these days."
supermoto,2yp9de,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yea I get that.  Honestly the ones I see for sale the most are stock and if they even have upgrades they're shit parts.  There's a few legit bikes and they're going for 8k or so and it makes sense.  But a stock 02 klx 250 with a bunch of miles for 4k?  It's insane.  But again I'm probably going to just end up buying new, even though I don't really want to."
supermoto,2yp9de,roger_podakter,2,Wed Mar 11 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"But a stock 02 klx 250 with a bunch of miles for 4k? It's insane   I totally agree. I'm not sure where these people are getting their numbers for stock, from the factory street legal bikes like the wr250 and DRZ400. They do hold their value well, but not that well."
supermoto,2yp9de,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"This is a good example of what I'm used to seeing.  This one isn't even that bad honestly.

supermoto,2yp9de,gobsthemesong,2,Thu Mar 12 13:25:00 2015 UTC,"That bike would go for $5,000 all day here in SoCal because it's been plated. Also, it's craigslist, so if you list your bike for the actual value, everyone asshole on the planet is going to call you up and say ""I'll give you $1000 below what you've listed the bike for"", which would be like $1500. Call him up and ask him what people have been offering him, and tell him you'll give him $2800, he'll probably take it.   Also, you don't want an 04-05 450 SX or SMR unless they did the necessary head work. They had bronze valve guides and titanium valves and the two metals are incompatible. So after about 50 or so hours on the motor the valves wear the valve guides and fuck up the valve seats/head. It costs about $300 to send the head out to have the valve guides replaced."
supermoto,2yp9de,qneville,2,Thu Mar 12 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"It's true that aftermarket parts de-value cars. But in the sumo world there are only a handful of mods you would actually do. If you buy the desired aftermarket parts your bike is more desirable.   For example. If the owner put aftermarket no-name shocks, lowered it and put a rack on it for touring it's going to devalue it.  But if the owner paid $2500 for a full FMF exhaust system with controller you'd be willing to pay more for that sumo compared to a stock sumo because that's actually a desired mod  Long story short. There a few mods that most sumo riders want. If you do it right people are willing to value your bike higher than stock.   But DIY mods almost always bring the value down. Like air box mods, or exup eliminator, plastic cutting, plasti dip and etc"

Instead you decide you're a cheap, lazy as, so you toss it in your truck, spend $15 of gas getting out someplace secluded, and you toss it along the trail. Congrats!

Loose grip on the bars (but not too loose!) and grip the tank with your knees if it need to.  Go gentle on the front brake and don't lock up in mud as you will just slide and lose control.   Don't go faster than you are comfortable with, it's not a race. Speed will come later.   I get that it's a sumo, but you can't be expecting grade A traction with those tires in wet mud."

Any suggestions for tires? I've owned Q2's, BT016's, S20's, and PR2's for my CBR but I'm not sure how any of them will be on this thing.  It sounds like the previous owner kept this thing pretty well maintained up to 13,500 km. It even came with fresh fluids and filters. I know there's a valve check around 20,000 km, and other than oil changes every 1500 km, is there anything else I should look out for regularly?  The only aftermarket parts seem to be the Yoshi RS3 Comp slip on, full Yoshi pipe, Yoshi CDI. I've ordered T-Rex axle sliders, Galfer stainless lines (because the front brake is unexpectedly sucky).

supermoto,2xypmj,NOFF44,5,Wed Mar 4 23:54:07 2015 UTC,Ktm lc4 aka 640. Or 620 for the older ones or 625  which is a bit lighter/ better carb than 640. Similar maintenance to Drz but more power and could be easier to find in Europe. They do have like 40kw but some came restricted to 25kw from the factory.

supermoto,2xypmj,Teeeeeemu,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"If you got the money go for the 625 and not 640. They're both the same cc(625iirc), it's just a model number. 625pros:   lighter (headlight, gas tank 9l vs 11l)  and better carb (flat-side with accelerator pump, all the race bikes have them, makes for a greater throttle response)   Might be something else minor but no cons really"
supermoto,2xypmj,Teeeeeemu,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:23:27 2015 UTC,"hmm thnx, how about the kw? because it's not easy to find a 35kw version of the 640, how about the 625?"
supermoto,2xypmj,Teeeeeemu,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:43:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yea I forgot about that... The bikes were made when the ""little a""  or nowadays A2 license only allowed for 25kw. So it's probably 25kw or the max (40kw?) Nevermind what I said... 640 is easier.   Restricting to 35kw should be possible but it's expensive. 1st dyno unrestricted, then restrict, then dyno again. Then with the papers you go to where you get your cars yearly inspections(idk what it's in english) At least in Finland it would cost like 300e  There's 2 looks for the 640: older (03-05) with a single exhaust   And newer (05-07) with dual exhaust and different rear plastics and headlight. Old is cheaper if you get an aftermarket exhaust"
supermoto,2xypmj,KofOaks,1 point,Fri Mar 6 09:58:01 2015 UTC,the problem is that I can't legally do it. I have to ship the bike through germany and england and back to be able to change the papers and I'm not willing to do that so I'll have to find a 35kw..

supermoto,2xypmj,ender_wiggum,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"According to the manual, initial check is about 600 miles or 1 month.    Check fuel lines for cracks Spark plugs, clean, regap Check valve clearance, adjust Check breather ventilation hoses for cracks and stuff Check engine idle speed (FI system) blah blah plenty more    After that, most serious checkups are just checking the valves every 3,000 miles or 6 months. It strikes a good balance between power and reliability. Better than DR-Z in performance/weight/style/off-road capabilities but it's more expensive, slightly less reliable, and requires conversion to SM/street legal.   You can read up more from the 2012+ repair manual here."

With basic tools and youtube and some time and patience to learn you can do it all. Definitely a sumo choice if you can find one or convert one and are willing to keep it in shape yourself.

I've never heard horror stories about either.   Also, buying a new DR650 seems like a waste of money, as they haven't changed that bike in like 25 years, plus throwing a bunch of money for USD forks and a shock upgrade seem like a waste of money, as the DR650 is a more budget minded motorcycle.

supermoto,2xms6m,henerydods,2,Mon Mar 2 10:41:58 2015 UTC,Get something for in between your front tire and the bolts which hold the front fender on. It will keep your suspension from compressing so much and have a more solid hold. You don't want your suspension under such pressure for long trips like that. Even a 2x4 cut to length and wedged in there works great. Also your rear suspension doesn't really need to be compressed when you already have a strap over the swing arm. I understand the being extra careful with your baby though. Have fun in the sunny weather man!

supermoto,2xhz20,xmojoe,2,Sat Feb 28 21:39:24 2015 UTC,"What's the maintenance schedule on that like? Those things are beastly, but I imagine a bit of a pit princess."
supermoto,2xhz20,probably_dead,2,Sat Feb 28 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Well performance has a price. They are race bikes after all. Oil changes for me depend on a few factors.. I change it after intensive riding, 250 miles, or 8~10 hrs. Which ever comes first  Factory recommends 500 miles or 10 hours. Personally I feel that the more you change the oil the better. After all what's a 25$ oil change on an expensive machine.  Valves, 1hr breakin. 1k miles then I do every 4k. Depending on movemenht.  Frictions, every 2k.  Brake/clutch fluids as needed.. every month or so.    Brake rotors, sprockets, as needed."
supermoto,2xhz20,somuchmoresnow,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"/u/xmojoe is pretty much spot on, but the oil could last a whole lot longer than 250miles.  Watch MotoNomad because 1) It's an awesome movie, and 2) They ride 2 '13 500EXCs 7000km from the KTM factory to Jordan with only two oil changes and a tire swap.  They make a point to show that the bikes are functioning 100% with only minimal service, they never even got to clean the air filters, and those bikes saw some serious abuse.  My 450 and a buddies' 350 are two of the easiest bikes I've ever worked on, though.  Not only are they relatively light and easy to move around, but everything was designed and laid-out to be serviced as quickly as possible.  I have yet to really find anything that super frustrating to work on.  A valve adjustment is quicker than an oil-change on some bikes.  I do worry that there's a smaller margin for delayed maintenance compared to an engine with double the oil capacity, but I change it every 500-750 miles of easy riding and the oil is always still relatively clean when I drain it."

supermoto,2xfvlf,LayinPipee,2,Sat Feb 28 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"The 650r doesn't record mileage. No odometer. That said, I agree that $4k is high, but might be worth $3500 assuming it kicks over easy and rides cherry."

supermoto,2xfvlf,fake_tea,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:35:42 2015 UTC,"The xr650r is one of the best bikes available period. 7 consecutive baja 1000 wins is about as accomplished as a bike could be in my opinion. I would trust the xrr over the ktm in almost any situation, although the ktm is a great bike.  Also I don't know if I'd want to be kickstarting a big thumper 10 times a day or your right leg would be twice the size as your left lol.  Sticker is most definitely a joke.

It is kick only, not sure if that's a problem for you.   You can't get 50/50 tires for 17s. Besides, if you're swapping tires the wheels have to come off anyway... I'd much rather have two sets of wheels."
supermoto,2xfvlf,slotard,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:21:46 2015 UTC,I think Avon Distanzia are about the closest to 50/50 tyres. Dunlop Mutant and Maxxis Goldspeed have a lot of tread pattern but are more a 'supermoto wet' in my experience.

I'm running part-worn/raced Pirelli SuperCorsa's now, which are a super soft compound that you would think would last 2 miles on the road but they've been going for about 2,500 miles now and the rear is just starting to show signs of getting low."

I thought maybe it was only designed for smooth riding, but I have taken both phones on the holder through bit of bush and bit of enduro riding on my Motard, and it still works a treat. It's really quite deceptive, because it does look like a very cheap and nasty product, however for $7 I thought why not give it a try, and I have never looked back.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Universal-Motorcycle-Bike-Bicycle-Handlebar-Mount-Holder-for-CellPhone-i-Phone-H-/141438067873?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_15&hash=item20ee5da4a1"

supermoto,2xdewv,Maskingtapeman,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"Idk, mine is at about 8k with no issues.  Checked the valves once, and they didn't need to be adjusted.  I've crashed it quite a bit, ridden it at 75-80mph for 4 hours straight with just gas station stops.  I would check the oil and the coolant, if they're clean, it's probably fine.  I have a buddy going on 30k on the stock piston and rings... DRZ's are are pretty much bullet proof if you regularly change the oil (every 800-1000 miles for me, others go 3k+).  Not the fastest, or the lightest, but ridiculously easy to maintain and a ton of fun."

There are a number of folks with over 80k on theirs without anything beyond regular maintenance. You can find them on advrider.   That bike is already high mileage, I don't think someone who would buy a 26k bike would have a problem buying a 40k bike assuming it's been taken care of.   Ride it, keep up with maintenance, sell it when you're done. All the other bikes you've mentioned are either worse to ride or much less durable and require more maintenance."

supermoto,2wo3k5,nickipoo,6,Sat Feb 21 17:12:13 2015 UTC,"I own an '05 300EXC dual purpose, in the process of tarding it now. I've owned several 2 stroke and 4 stroke sportsbikes, and several 4 stroke motards and dual purpose bikes, and 2 stroke dirtbikes and racebikes. I've seen a lot of threads like this, and invariably, every man and his dog pops in to comment on them whether or not they actually have experience with them.  Usually you'll get:  a) Person who's read about 2 strokes on the internet (ie comments from other people on threads like this)  b) Person who's ridden 2 stroke dirtbikes  c) Person who's tried a 2 stroke streetbike and had a bad experience because they got a lemon or were just too used to 4 strokes  d) Person who last rode a 2 stroke back in the (or built in the) 70s or 80s  Now for some misconceptions:   It's not good for a 2 stroke to run at constant high RPM   Look at outboard motors on boats. Look at planes that use 2 stroke engines. Or even better, just look at the little 50cc mopeds used in their hundreds of thousands all over the world every day. You don't have to go far in any reasonably sized city, anywhere, to see a 50cc 2 stroke humming down the street at 60kph. Besides, this point is irrelevant anyway, since any reasonably-geared 2 stroke shouldn't be in its powerband cruising down the open road at 100kph - most likely it will be sitting just below it, and you would tap down a gear (on a 6 speed) for overtaking purposes.   They foul plugs   Any modern 2 stroke enduro bike will lug around on trails all day using the bottom few RPM in its range and is unlikely to foul anything. Plug fouling hasn't been a genuine issue in 2 stroke road bikes since before the mid 1980s, and modern 2 stroke enduros are more or less the same. I can attest to spending a lot of time cruising on the open road, not hooning, and not fouling plugs. If you do foul a plug on the road then you need to think about your premix ratio and jetting   Maintenance is more than a 4 stroke   Directly comparing my '05 450exc to my '05 300exc: No. No, the 2 stroke isn't more maintenance. And yes, the maintenance you do is a lot cheaper, and easier. 450: 10 hours, oil and filter. 300: 10 hours, oil. 450: 20 hours, valve clearances. 300: 20 hours, oil. There are many stories of both the RFS 4 strokes and the 300 2 strokes going 300+ hours on a top end, bottom ends being more or less invincible. So that's more an issue of doing what  you feel like.  So yeah. If you're commuting on the highway for extended periods, probably not a great choice because of vibration and the hassle of premix. But will it do it? Yes. As easily as any tuned 4 stroke tard will. As easily as a DRZ-SM? No.  I have ridden all my 2 stroke bikes both ""normally"" and ""WFO"", in town, in the countryside, hills, track, you name it. As I have always had issues keeping my front wheel down anywhere, I'm maybe not the best qualified person to comment on normal riding? I can tell you that it can definitely be done, and that you can definitely commute on them without riding like an asshole. Between the 450 and the 300, I'd say the 300 only goads you into riding like a twat slightly more than the 450.  I think your main consideration should be pre-mix, as really, if you're looking at any true ""dirtbike to streetbike"" conversion, pre-mixing the fuel is the most major distinction between a 2 and 4 stroke. Look at one of these for that http://primemotorcycleaccessories.com/shop/oil-mixing-bottle.  Anyway good luck and happy to answer any questions. Don't listen to anyone who hasn't actually done it themselves or closely known someone who has, as there's a huge amount of speculation out there from the inexperienced."

supermoto,2wo3k5,she_did_what,1 point,Sun Feb 22 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"... How on earth have you had such luck with not fouling plugs?!?.. I've had experience with rm/kx125's and a bunch of 2t 125 gokarts and honestly every single time a beginner rides any of them and manages to go a minute or two without giving it some stick the engine conks to a halt with spooge/fouled plugs.  Ive had far more thorough experience with carbs than most and have built up a fairly extensive set of spare jets for a variety of carbs over the years attempting to tweak things, I've played with premix and am aware that people often have counterintuitive problems confusing that mixing less oil in makes it run richer and colder, and sometimes you want more oil for it to be leaner and hotter to burn the oil.  All said and done: the only thing that seems to keep them going is making sure every minute or two they get a decent blast of throttle to clear things out - low throttle cruising for distances I'll believe when I see it, given that with the karts we go as far as using atmospheric sensors & charts and test to the nearest jets and needle settings, but still can't have something 'cruise'... We can get good throttle response & power at low revs, and often use dyno's to tune, but it'll all be for naught if you let it get gummed up by not revving it (under load).  I'd believe that some bigger 2t engines might be able to tolerate things a bit bitter, and maybe it's a small race-2t engine problem... But honestly, whilst I don't think I'm the most experienced and may well be less than you, I'm having a very hard time believing you won't have a problem with fouled plugs riding most 2t dirtbikes crising at low revs on the road."
supermoto,2wo3k5,NotNotLitotes,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:28:07 2015 UTC,"Yo, second sentence answers it. I think I meant to specify in my response, but I forgot.  I've never had any problem with fouling plugs with my enduro 2Ts or road-bike based 2Ts. My old CR125, yup no way could you cruise around on that thing without fouling a plug. 125 mx engines are a totally different beast to enduro 2Ts, even smaller cc.  I think this is where a lot of the confusion comes in to riding road 2 strokes, because lots of people only experience the MX side of dirtbike engines. It sounds like you definitely have more experience ripping things apart than me though, no doubt about that.  One of the brilliant things about enduro/road 2Ts though is their ability to lug at low revs all day, either doing technical enduro stuff or putting around town. Definitely ride a big bore 2T if you get the chance. They're like a 4 stroke on the bottom but still have a nice hit."

He daily's his CR's as well as taking them to full size GP tracks and races sport bikes.  The larger displacement 2 strokes have wider ratio transmissions and don't rev as high as some of the smaller CC or track oriented 2 strokes and as long as you don't mind mixing oil, and kicking one of those beasts to start it I say go for it.  Another plus is that engine maintenance and rebuilds are cheap, even though I know several CR500's that have 500+ hours on their motors without needing to be rebuilt."

I just went to look at the husky and apparently they have some issue with oil spraying into the airbox, the kit is about $300 so that's a downer. It was a fun test ride though, definitely a wheelie machine. What kind of maintenance is required on MX bikes? I'm coming from a WR250X which is pretty simple."
supermoto,2wkkpz,overlordkitty,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:23:37 2015 UTC,500mi oil changes. Nothing like the wr250x which is similar to a DRZ (2-4k). Lots of valve checks. Huskies are particularly high maintenance bikes
supermoto,2wkkpz,ride365,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:38:34 2015 UTC,60 hours is a lot for a motocross bike I wouldn't be surprised if the manual doesn't suggest replacing the piston at that point - and street riding will require more maintenance more often.  Husky engine slightly less so.

Powder coating requires the calipers to be completely stripped bare. And all holes and threads need to be plugged. But it withstands heat and wear better.

They used to dominate the Baja 1000 back in the day before the KX500 two strokes took over. Scott Summers rode them in the woods to many east coast enduro championships! They are VERY versitile bikes! The 650L has electric start and IIRC about 30 lbs over an XR600 (aircooled dirtbike). The 600/650L will accept most XR600 hop up parts. A jet kit and exhaust is great and will wake these motors up, if you need any more get a Stage 1 cam and big bore kit ($150 for cam, $100 for piston set, $60 for reboring) and you will have a great bike that will destroy any DRZ400 on the street and get you more tickets than you could ever want!

He is just a hair faster at the top of 4th thru 5th everytime.  The sound is louder on his while riding because they shoot up in the air instead of behind you. He has the stainless ones,  It is still way lighter then stock even as stainless.  The only downside for the duals is when he has bottomed out and dented the y pipe which runs under the skid plate, So if you want to jump the bike I would stick with a single pipe.  The duals look and sound great with solid performance to match."

I've seen it suggested that the pipes get in the way of the sump plug.  How loud would you say they were? Over the 100db mark?  Can you get a bash plate under them?  Have you dropped the bike and what precautions would you take to make sure the pipes were ok if you did?

supermoto,2wfjca,mrgreen1114,2,Thu Feb 19 23:50:27 2015 UTC,"You have to pull the duals off to do the oil changes, Kind of a pain but really not that bad.  Also you will have to lose your passenger pegs but you can make some brackets to make them work, If you need instructions i'll have my buddy get more details on this. Also you will need the Yoshimura gangster lean kickstand because the stock one will not work with them.  If you buy new its included in the kit.  We've talked about protecting them somehow but it just doesn't seem plausible because it's the lowest part of the bike and we would just be losing clearance to try and protect it.  They are pretty loud, they are a lot louder with the inserts taken out. It's the distinct Yoshimura 4 stroke sound.  Yep he dropped it twice, Once on a dirt road turning around just fell over dented the pipe.... and again in a wheelie, scratched it up pretty good.... I've laid mine down twice as well and pipe still looks perfect hidden under my replaced plastic fender ;) His still look good from a distance but it's got some rash."

supermoto,2wekiw,peen_was,2,Thu Feb 19 06:12:43 2015 UTC,"I have an '08 KTM 450 EXC-R  I""m honestly not sure anymore what the -R means, but here's my take:  I bought the bike 5 months ago, it came with some DNA sumo rims as well as the original dirt rims.  The sumo sprocket and tires were done, so I put the dirt rims on there. I haven't had enough money to replace the sprocket/tires, so I can only comment on the dirt performance. The previous owner did street almost exclusively on the sumo rims, so I'm guessing it was good.  With the dirt rims/tires - the bike absolutely destroys anything I put it on. It's definitely much better than I am. On the street with this setup, it does fairly well. Around 50 I start to get a rhythmic vibration. It's pretty unpleasant and I don't like going distances above this speed. Around 80, I get the speed wobbles. Otherwise, it handles the roads really well, and I haven't had issues.  The big downside to a KTM is frequent maintenance. Oil changes ever 1k miles, valve check every 1.5k (I think) and the like.  Oh, and power wheelies for dayyssss"
supermoto,2wekiw,rudolfs001,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"TLDR; 07 model KTM450exc, bought converted to SM and have added mods. Very fast and very powerful, although hydralic clutch is a set back, could be an expensive conversion.  Yes I have converted. Bought the bike in NOV14. Bike is an 07 Model, which I have put about 4000km since then, without commuting, just riding after work every afternoon and all weekends. Bought with low milage and great condition for 4k, spent about another 1500 on mods and fixing little things so far (800 on very hard suspension because im a very large build). Did a new rear tyre which im loving, and new sprocket which really helps. I have enduro tyres as well, but still to go and use them, and havent really been trail riding, mainly road, however a lot of offroading too because motard. The motard tyres actually handle exceptionally well offroad, much better than I expected, so I am sort of able to use them as offroad tyres. I prefer open trails rather than logs and roots and turns and things, mainly because tyres but also because of the size of me, but they do handle pretty good offroad haha, I have taken them through about 700km of dirt roads and trails, and they eat gravel, but feel a little bit touchy. Also the bike wants to go down in sand, and doesnt wanna go forward in mud, but thats to be expected I guess. I'm not sure I would recommend KTM because there are a few issues (hydralic clutch, bigger front motard disc), although they are extremely responsive and powerful bikes. I also have 2 dirt bound WR450's, and the difference in power is phenomenal, especially as the KTM has been slightly geared up and will happy cruise at 60mph in 5th or about 72-75 in 6th without really pushing the engine at all. All in all, I would maybe do it, although you have a bit of money to spend on oversized disc and relocation bracket which you will probably need, as well as wheels if you are converting from dirt and not buying already converted. Also would like to re-iterate that hydraulic clutch is a different experience from a cable-clutch, and I don't much like it. In terms of handling and response, the bike is exceptional. Corners are actually fun, opposed to a car, and also a great opportunity to overtake cars, and the bike is just a rocket, so this is a real plus haha. Hope any of this helps, feel free to PM me to know more or whatever, any questions welcome  VG"

There are a few exceptions - some BMW spoked wheels run the spokes to the outside of the rim so they don't need tubes, and Alpina makes some that seal with O rings (I think KTM used those for a while).

The parts fiche shows pretty much everything as the same. Buy a FS450, put the Adler clutch in it, do the suspension(which you would normally do anyway,especially because the new 4CS forks suck), slap on a 16.5 and a 17 and a big brake kit and you're good to go.  The MSRP for an MX FC450 is $9,049 (I think) and the MSRP for an FS450 is $11,192.28 (from what I could find in Euros and $12,174 from what I could find in Pounds on a British dealer page). You can just about convert an MX bike to a supermoto for around $2100 and you could definitely do it for $3125 and end up with a much better set up bike."

When he was at a 2 day dual sport, a dealer owner we know came over and asked him what the problem was, (bike was on the ground with cover off), Turns out, he had the washer in the back of the clutch basket in the wrong way.

Plus the offroad capability."
supermoto,2vgnka,mb_mark,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:17:28 2015 UTC,"I would start to answer this by asking if you've ridden a SM, yet?  I made the move 2 years ago and have since sold my sport bike to get another SM.  I currently have a 2 stroke and a 4 stroke SM.  I was always concerned while riding my RC51 about a rock, dropping it, scuffs, etc.  With the SM, not only are they super easy to ride, but as some have already said, they're totally a blast.  I started out on a XR600 dual sport and just put slicks on the stock rims (21""/18"").  Kinda fun but gearing was tough and I felt like I was really high in the air while riding.  Once I could afford the wide 17"" rims wrapped with good rubber my whole view changed.  I could now corner effortlessly, wheelies and stoppies felt natural, and I never passed any curb, ramp, trail, etc that felt off limits.  True, you could probably do 75% of the same riding with a dual sport with slicks, but once the bike is dropped with 17"" and you spend a few bucks to get the suspension updated, there's no question how much fun a SM can be!  This is 2 weeks ago at an asphalt track: http://imgur.com/Ko7jdB0   I'm riding a CR500 in full SM trim, I have SOOO much more fun riding this than I did riding my RC51.  On the RC I could go faster but was in ""serious"" mode the whole time.  Granted, I dont have the same top speed on the CR500, but I'm fast in the corners and I'm smiling the ENTIRE time.

supermoto,2venj3,EnduroRacer,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:59:02 2015 UTC,How does one even learn to slide their back tire out like that
supermoto,2venj3,Huck_n_Hope,2,Tue Feb 10 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"It's called 'backing it in' when they go into corners with it. It is done by ripping into the corner and setting up like a car does for a drift. Steer out of the corner, just before the brake point you dump down 2 or sometimes three gears into usually first or second, using the clutch and the front brake you control your braking and the rear wheel.   The idea is the rear wheel is still rotating, albeit slower, and the slide is controlled by pulling in the clutch a little more (feathering) to gain more traction and letting it out more (engaging the engine in the lower gear and engine braking) to get more slide.   As far as learning I have heard grass or dirt is nice for the first day of jitters but nothing like pavement. Don't look for wet or snafu either.  The inconsistency of the surface and ability to slide on it will make it hell to learn."
supermoto,2venj3,EnduroRacer,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:44:53 2015 UTC,So essentially all the acceleration is done upon entering the curve after that it's feathering the clutch In lower gear to control your back tire speed/rotation. Right?
supermoto,2venj3,Huck_n_Hope,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at least in the shots you were looking at. That's the only way short of locking it up to drift on the way into a corner.  It is good for getting the bike turned as much as possible to exit the hairpin with less turn to negotiate when you're accelerating out.   Also, guys can power slide out of corners. I've seen most often on street bike type racing but it does happen fairly often in supermoto as well.  It's supposed to allow a harder acceleration while still keeping the bike in the track in a tight exit. Lots of videos you can google. Really impressive stuff.   EDIT:  The acceleration is done before entering the curve not upon entering. If you look at some other videos you can see the set up better. Watch the suspension to see what the bike is doing. Longer forks means the weight is on the rear tire and the bike is probably accelerating. Compressed forks mean braking. Not sure how experienced you are."

supermoto,2vdrb5,crenstro,3,Tue Feb 10 08:44:49 2015 UTC,"If your suspension is soft, you just have to trust your front tire and grab a handful of brake while you scoot up and lean over the bars."

supermoto,2vdrb5,Maskingtapeman,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:23:05 2015 UTC,"2nd gear at about 20-25mph pull the clutch in, bring the rpm's up, and let the clutch out real fast, don't dump it, but a very quick release."
supermoto,2vdrb5,MARKWEBBER,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"You need to give it a lot of throttle and LEAN BACK. Leaning back lowers the blance point. Don't worry about the back break for now, there is enough engine breaking by cutting the throttle to bring the front tire back down."
supermoto,2vdrb5,Xan_the_man,7,Tue Feb 10 04:48:57 2015 UTC,Don't worry about the back break for now   That goes against everything anyone has said about wheelies! The lean back is good advice though.

My mechanic, a husky specialist, just can't find parts, but that may just be because it has to be 09 or 2010 smr parts only. So maybe this would have better luck with sourcing anything.   That price does seem high, i planned to sell my 2010 with 3000 miles for 6 something when i actually get it all back together, but maybe the market you're in they can ask that much, but around me that price would be a no go.

supermoto,2vb0l2,ImnoArsonist,2,Mon Feb 9 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"Some touring bikes have 18's, but 19's and 21's are mostly going to be offroad or dualsport, I will agree."
supermoto,2vb0l2,noeatnosleep,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:28:02 2015 UTC,This is pretty much the right answer. Everyone goes to 17s because tires like Q3s or Michelin powers or whatever other sport tires come in 17 inch diameters.
supermoto,2vb0l2,noeatnosleep,4,Mon Feb 9 20:07:47 2015 UTC,That's not enough information. 17 tires of what type? Slicks? Dualsports? How wide? What type of bike?
supermoto,2vb0l2,slotard,2,Mon Feb 9 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"it was meant to be a blanket question, but your question just gave me an answer"
supermoto,2vb0l2,noeatnosleep,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:06:52 2015 UTC,"The main reason that 17"" tires are preferred for supermoto is that it's the most common size for performance oriented street tires. 16.5"" used to be popular for race tires, I'm not sure if anyone makes them anymore though.   Smaller diameter tires provide quicker handling but less stability. Wider tires provide more grip but slightly slow handling. Manufacturers discovered that 17"" is a good size for sportbike wheels, and because sportbikes use 17"" wheels that's the size tires are made for. If they had chosen 18"", that would work well too.   You can get reasonable tires in 21/18, but the wheels are narrow so you end up with bias ply rather than radials. You can't find soft compounds in those sizes."
supermoto,2vb0l2,BickNlinko,3,Mon Feb 9 18:16:08 2015 UTC,I'm so dumb. I thought I was in /r/dualsport when I answered originally. Lol.
supermoto,2vb0l2,slotard,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"16.5"" used to be popular for race tires, I'm not sure if anyone makes them anymore though.    Most guys run 16.5"" front wheels on their race bikes, as you get a taller profile tire and the bike turns in a bit quicker. All the major slick manufacturers make a 16.5"" tire for supermoto. No one runs a 16.5"" wheel on the street because you can't find any street legal rubber to fit it.   Michelin is now making a 16"" front supermoto slick, but I haven't seen anyone run them yet."
supermoto,2vb0l2,BickNlinko,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that club racers (on sportbikes rather than 'tards) had pretty much entirely moved away from 16.5"" due to tire selection, I didn't realize that supermoto was different."

supermoto,2v8ayp,slotard,4,Sun Feb 8 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"In 2008 I bought a 2004 KTM 625SMC, had it for a year and rode it a lot before it got stolen. It later turned out the DMV had fucked up paperwork, and two bikes were registered under the same VIN... mine probably didn't have that VIN on the frame.   I've been riding streetbikes ever since, mostly naked twins. My current bike is an SV1000 set up pretty well (GSXR forks, ZX10 shock, Monster seat on custom TIG'd aluminum subframe, full M4, no STVs, dyno tuned, etc).   Well, I'm now making reasonably good money so I decided to pick up another supermoto.   This one is a 2003 WR450F, Excel rims on Talon hubs anodized black, Brembo radial master, Braking caliper and rotor, FMF header to stock can, billet top triple, suspension supposedly redone for supermoto.   It needs a little carb work, I'll check the valves and change the fluids too, but it isn't too easy to find plated dirtbikes in CA. I'll probably put a Shorai battery in there too.

supermoto,2v4h2t,Mr_Braaap,4,Sat Feb 7 23:25:17 2015 UTC,"Could someone explain why SMs lean away from the turn, and sport bikes lean into it?"
supermoto,2v4h2t,bdpakaknox,5,Sun Feb 8 03:00:51 2015 UTC,"The way i heard it explained is that leaning the bike, like in SM, allows for faster transitions between slower back to back corners.  Leaning with the bike reduces the lean angle of the bike itself, generally, and lowers your CG more, allowing for higher corner speeds.  Mind you, that's what i've gathered, so it could be wrong, but it sort of makes sense."
supermoto,2v4h2t,PenguinScotty,4,Sun Feb 8 07:28:28 2015 UTC,"That's about right, plus in slower corners you are on top if the bike weighting the outside peg , sort of pushing the bike down and into the asphalt, like you're on a dirt bike hitting a berm or fast flat track type corner."
supermoto,2v4h2t,BickNlinko,2,Sun Feb 8 09:47:35 2015 UTC,"I had the same question, but your answer only makes sense for sport bikes. I get that you lean into the turn and lower your center of gravity. What the question was and still is for me is why SM's like in this gif lean out of the turn, essentially trying to sit straight up instead of down and into the turn (kissing the mirror)."
supermoto,2v4h2t,civilitarygaming,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"In case of Supermoto, your weight stays higher, but centralized, so for example, you have a right hander, immediately followed by a left hander on a go-kart track.  Essentially you are only moving the bike from right to left, instead the bike AND your body, allowing for a faster transition."
supermoto,2v4h2t,PenguinScotty,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:51:30 2015 UTC,So it has more to do with a faster transition? For example if you are in a long sweeper you would still want to lean into the turn instead of against it (since you don't have to switch for another upcoming turn)?
supermoto,2v4h2t,civilitarygaming,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:43:47 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's how it was explained to me.   Fast turns with less rapid changes of direction tend to favor you leaning off the bike. Slower corners with rapid changes of direction tend to be easier with a more upright stance.   All said and done, though, you still see quite a few SM riders soing knee down even on the slower stuff.  For me, leaning the bike and leg out js more natural to me on a SM because it's how i ride the dirtbikes as well."
supermoto,2v4h2t,PenguinScotty,4,Mon Feb 9 07:55:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on what style SM riding you do. If you do leg out, you need to balance everything, so leaning the bike away is what you do. Knee out RR style, is as sports bike do."

The lean angle is 100% rider preference, we have guys that are equally fast riding knee out or foot out.   Some of the weird looking super moto riding techniques are due to ground clearance issues with the pegs and the high center of gravity dirt bikes have over road bikes."

Front tire may as well have been a ski, rear spun with anything more than the slightest throttle.   I tried to see what would happen when I grabbed brake, and ass end came out sideways and I shot my feet out to catch myself as it decided to slide the other way,  but I kept it upright. Soo I looked pretty damn goofy. Rest of the way I barely crawled off idle in second, any reason to brake would have definitely caused me to go down. Turning was as upright as possible, took corners at a crawl with no leaning.   11/10 will not try again on pavement and street tire."

On occasion you'll see them for closer to $3000, but that isn't too common. I'm aware that this is higher than some states, but it's no longer possible to plate dirtbikes in CA that aren't factory street legal.   Compared to starting at $3000 for a beater, this doesn't look too horribly overpriced to me, but if they were $1500 like in some states it would be a different story."
supermoto,2uxn2z,HoneyBadgerRy,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"I would still do the conversion yourself on a $3000 bike over buying this.

You can do better."

supermoto,2uxn2z,tifuandlostmydrone,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:37:30 2015 UTC,"You can send the title to SD and have them title it as MC, then you can plate it in 99% of the country. Not sure if you can in Cali.  For the price though, you could get a fairly new Wr(4/2)50r."
supermoto,2uxn2z,rctaylors,2,Fri Feb 6 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"This really depends on how sharp the DMV lady is when you try to register it. Most of the time OHV vehicle VIN numbers are flagged in the system, so they will just deny you. I even know a guy who bought a plated WR450 with a current registration and when he went to transfer the reg into his name the lady revoked it, so he basically lost the $1000 he over payed for the bike because it is now no longer plated. Keep in mind you can't even register a red sticker dirt bike as a green sticker dirt bike as it shows up in their system, so trying to pass a red/green sticker OHV bike as a street legal bike is very difficult and you generally need to ""know someone"" at the DMV.   CA is now a big bitch about OHV registrations and plating shit thats not supposed to be legal."
supermoto,2uxn2z,tifuandlostmydrone,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:33:38 2015 UTC,"A few people have had luck with bringing in bikes that aren't supposed to be plated from out of state and claiming that they have 7500+mi on them, but a fair number have been denied as well."
supermoto,2uxn2z,ImnoArsonist,2,Fri Feb 6 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"This is a nicely set up bike. I think the price is a little high, but there is definitely room to move. USD forks are fantastic - they really sharpen the bike up. I think any tastefully modded and well-maintained XR650R will hold resale value based on reliability and racing heritage. (no personal bias here at all...)"
supermoto,2uxn2z,tifuandlostmydrone,2,Fri Feb 6 06:37:58 2015 UTC,I have room to move on the price if I don't include some of TW extras but it is more than fair considering the market value of these bikes in CA.
supermoto,2uxn2z,ImnoArsonist,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:39:00 2015 UTC,Does being in CA explain the mostly stock exhaust? Is that a requirement?  Setup nearly the same as mine!

supermoto,2unrqf,SDP40610,11,Tue Feb 3 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"The DR-Z400SM Suzuki is a good choice for a first supermoto. They're pretty much bulletproof and low maintenance compared to other SM's, and are less expensive new or used. It's pretty much been the same bike for 10-12 years so there's plenty of aftermarket stuff for it, and you can get a decent performance boost by simply opening up the airbox with a holesaw, buying an aftermarket exhaust (optional) and re-jetting the carb. The downside is that they are heavier than, say, a KTM, and they have less horsepower. That said, unless you're racing or riding on freeways they have more than enough power to get you in trouble if you ride over your head.  Of course, there are better bikes out there, but they are more expensive and usually require much more maintenance and more frequent engine rebuilds - everthing is a trade-off. You just have to decide which course you want to take. I bought a DRZ because I lived in an apartment with no place to work on the bike, and I needed something that required minimal maintenance. I've since moved into a townhouse with a garage, and if I were to buy one now I'd be looking at the 701 Husqvarna (which is a rebranded 690 KTM).  I would caution against buying a converted dirt bike as a first purchase, because states are beginning to crack down on licensing. North Carolina, for example, just started refusing to renew registration on some bikes in that class, and other states have preceded them. I wouldn't want you to get stuck with a bike you can't use, get familiar with the laws and trends in the law before you commit to a project like that.  I hope some or all of this helps you decide. Above all, get yourself a supermoto, don't get yourself in trouble with it but pick your times and places and have a blast! I'm 62 and when I swing my leg over my SM I feel like I'm 20 again. It's absolutely all I can do to not ride like a complete hooligan."
supermoto,2unrqf,capn_gaston,5,Tue Feb 3 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, this is going to a bit long but bear with me.  Start small.  If you have no street experience, find yourself a KLX250f, CRF230L, WR250X or a DRZ400.  They don't have crazy power but they are excellent introductory bikes that won't set you back too far (between 3 and 5,000$ depending on mods in my area) and are generally bullet proof with easy maintenance schedules. Out of that list, I would personally go with the WR if you can find one. Also they hold their resale value well, so as long as it isn't too abused you can usually resell for what you paid.  There is also the 250cc range that is not as beginner friendly like a KTM250 XC-f but good luck finding a used one.   If you are bound and determined to get a 450cc or larger, KTM, Husaberg, and Husqvarna are your only options as far as factory street legal.  None of them are cheap (KTM EXC 450 is around $11,000), and they are hard to find used. Also the maintenance is a little more intensive, it isn't outrageous like a lot of people on this sub would would lead you to believe but it is more frequent than one of the previous bikes I mentioned.    The final option is to get a bike and convert it to Supermoto, this method can be pricey depending on what wheels/tires and the other farkles you need to make a bike street legal in your state.  Getting a MX bike street legal isn't difficult but it can be discouraging if you are new to the SM scene and just want to ride. Also depending on the bike, the maintenance will again be a little more rigorous but still not insane.    Gear:  Gear is important and you should not skimp on gear.   You will need boots, pants, jacket, gloves and a helmet.  Boots:  I suggest at least over your ankle motorcycle specific either dirt or street boots.  Pants: leather is preferred but there are a few brands that make non-leather MC specific pants that offer protection.  Jacket: leather offers the best protection, but no one except elitist assholes will fault you for wearing textile.  Gloves: Leather Full gauntlet road race gloves offer the best protection but gloves are up to your own preference.   Helmet: There is a big debate about how much a helmet costs vs. it's protective ability, so you can choose what helmet you want so long as you get one and wear it.  My only suggestion is at least get a full face helmet.  You picked the cheapest type of motorcycling to get into, but initial cost of everything can get expensive and is all dependent and what you get."

supermoto,2uptiv,CharlesFrancisX,3,Wed Feb 4 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"First off, I generally stay away from plastidip unless it's temporary. The stuff looks good but starts to fall apart.(for example I wanted to paint a piece with chalkboard paint, I dipped it first so it was removable, I liked it, so I removed the dip and did it straight on the plastic)  Also if you fuck up, keep coating and let it dry. Half the time the error will get coated and look fine, but if it doesn't let it dry and it's going to be nice and removable. Pain in the ass but less messy.   EDIT: Also don't rush, short, thin coats. Wait 15 min between coats too"
supermoto,2uptiv,watsyurface,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:31:22 2015 UTC,Thanks. The plasti dip will be temp. I will be getting white plastics in the summer.
supermoto,2uptiv,notoriouz,3,Thu Feb 5 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"You can fix that very easily.  Get some thinner and rub it on, it will turn the dip back into a liquid, after you do that, just respray.  It looks like you put too much on during each coat, which causes runs and that shitty looking texture you ended up with.  Make sure your first coat is just a light brushing, it's not supposed to look covered (or even close) for the first coat, or the second coat for that matter.  If done correctly, it will start to look good after you're 3rd coat. Make sure to do at least 4 coats, but I'd recommend 5.  Also, make sure your spraying motion is steady and the correct distance away, otherwise runs will be inevitable and it will come out looking rough every time.  http://i.imgur.com/ft0U4TQ.jpg  It's only flat black, but you get the idea. If done properly, you will get a very nice smooth finish, the only ""rough"" spots on my wheels are where the previous owner bashed the rims off the curb, which was my reason for plasti-dipping, it really helps hide the imperfections caused by curb rash.  All of my wheels got messed up when I put winter tires on the rims, it only cost me $20 to fix all 4 and took about 2 hours. Be patient, pay attention, and it will work out fine.  Make sure the surface you're spraying is spotless, no dirt or grime at all, it makes things much easier. The cleaning took the most time, but the end result is worth it. I haven't had any flaking, peeling, or blemishes of any kind from normal driving and wear and tear. It looks just as good as the day I sprayed it on. It can be cleaned without worry of peeling off, I use pressure washers on it as well and it doesn't affect it in the least.  If you need any other advice, input, anything, send me a message and I'll do my best to try and help you out."
supermoto,2uptiv,notoriouz,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"ok, thanks. I bought more plasti dip to give it another go.  but some pieces don't look so bad, they are a bit rough tho. like this one. The bumps are more noticeable in the picture than in person.

Suzuki knows how to make a reliable bike."
supermoto,2u7slm,witoldc,2,Fri Jan 30 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I've got a 990 Supermoto and have yet to have a problem, but my mileage is low.  My KTM 450 EXC is pretty tough, though.  I've ridden the wheels off that.  I grew up on the Japanese stuff, and you're right, they make excellent stuff.  Always have.  It just has never been a priority for them to build amazing dual-sport bikes (XR650R's excluded).  Sorry to hear about the 690... What sort of problems have you had, if I might ask?  Engine-related?"
supermoto,2u7slm,ender_wiggum,3,Fri Jan 30 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Man, I have only 10K-ish miles on it, and I've had more problems with it than sportbikes with 50K miles.  Rocker arm, leaking fork fluid (I don't stunt), and most recently some random part that even the dealer couldn't figure out and they spent 2 months and talking to KTM HQ to figure it out.  Very expensive.  (I will have to track down my receipts as to the last issue.)  It's a fun bike to ride, but I don't trust it at all.  I know it's just a matter of time before it leaves me stranded somewhere.  From what I understand, bigger KTM offerings like 990 have a lot fewer problems."

supermoto,2u3pkj,ratatooie,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:10:28 2015 UTC,"It's heavy. It rides more like a ""normal"" motorcycle than a supermoto."
supermoto,2u3pkj,overlordkitty,2,Fri Jan 30 02:03:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's only 7kg heavier than the DRZ stock. The extra horses more than make for it. It feels slightly taller and the front likes to turn in at lower speeds but that's about it.   The power is night and day better. It feels much more nimble due to the tank not being between your knees.  It's definitely a road going sumo, but then it doesn't pretend to be a dedicated track bike. Try jumping onto a Hornet or Bandit after the 690."
supermoto,2u3pkj,overlordkitty,0,Fri Jan 30 10:50:53 2015 UTC,"Why do people bring up the weight like it's the only thing that matters? The whole bike is BIGGER. Even the fairings are huge.

supermoto,2u3pkj,testguyaccount,0,Sun Feb 1 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"It's a tank. Heavier and bigger and turns worse than an XR650 probably. Feels more like a sport bike with supermoto styling.

supermoto,2u3pkj,overlordkitty,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:31:22 2015 UTC,You are full of it.  I just looked up the specs.  Your converted DRZ400S actually has a LARGER wheelbase than the KTM 690 SM.  1485mm vs 1480mm but it's larger.  You've clearly never ridden one and have no idea what you are talking about.  The weight difference is negligible and comes down to how much fuel is in each tank.

Edit: you could've just looked at my submission history http://m.imgur.com/kY9PdB7 Oh, and not that you would understand this, but my DRZ corners much better than any bike I've ever had except my old converted crf.

supermoto,2u3pkj,overlordkitty,1 point,Thu Feb 5 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you are living in a dream world. You can easily look up a picture of both bikes sitting next to each other and see how much bigger the KTM is.  Fact of the matter is, the 690 is made for long enduro riding, like...in the desert. Or the highway if someone is sadistic. Trust me, I did ride it hard in the twisties. But any real dirt bike would beat a 690 easily and that's really all I'm saying.  By the way...there's a lot more that determines your bike's agility (like forks), but a DRZ400SM: 1460mm / SMC690: 1480mm / My bike: 1475mm"

supermoto,2u0kjd,FistMyBellyButton,7,Wed Jan 28 22:45:27 2015 UTC,"If I read ""needs an oil change"" in an add I would assume the person selling probably doesn't do regular maintenance on the bike and I would be worried about it. Just do the oil change then you car put ""oil just changed"" it looks a lot better. Also if I buyer checks and the shits black it might not be good."
supermoto,2u0kjd,fake_tea,-1,Thu Jan 29 03:44:09 2015 UTC,"I want to give the buyer as many options as possible. I can get everything done by the best guys in Dallas, but I see no point in spending all that money if the buyer prefers to do it himself and get the bike for that much cheaper."
supermoto,2u0kjd,megustaPRO,1 point,Thu Jan 29 06:05:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would lower the price. Yes you can find cheap ebay radiators, but I would really prefer OEM. Which is expensive. Also an oil change is not that hard to do... look up videos on it and tutorials. All you need is sockets, an oil filter, and the new oil.   For that price I could pick up a mint DRZ with aftermarket accessories on it. Not trying to be a dick, that price is just too high."
supermoto,2u0kjd,megustaPRO,1 point,Thu Jan 29 15:39:32 2015 UTC,How much do you think it is worth?
supermoto,2u0kjd,megustaPRO,0,Thu Jan 29 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Based on owning a Euro bike, I would estimate it at $3900-$4100. Always sell high though, and settle on a fair/firm price."
supermoto,2u0kjd,paulrulez742,1 point,Thu Jan 29 16:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is what I was thinking. Selling it for 4k or 4.5k from 5k looks better than 4.5k firm."
supermoto,2u0kjd,American-American,0,Thu Jan 29 16:23:39 2015 UTC,Start at $4500 and don't let it drop down past $4200.
supermoto,2u0kjd,paulrulez742,5,Thu Jan 29 16:31:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds high, but I don't know the market for that machine. Sounds even higher after reading ""all it needs is a new radiator"". Those aren't cheap from standard metric machines. ~$400 for the OEM one on my DRZ, and I can't imagine Aprilia is going to be any cheaper than that..."
supermoto,2u0kjd,Ski1215,3,Wed Jan 28 23:13:15 2015 UTC,"Definitely high, methinks. New, this thing retailed for ~$8500. It has definitely depreciated more than $3500 in ~8 years. That, plus the things wrong with it, leads me to think it is high. BUT, the market for supermotos in Dallas is pretty good, and people will snap things up even if they are a little high.  I'd leave it where it is, and accept whatever someone throws at you above $4000. You never know, some people will pay what you ask."
supermoto,2u0kjd,Ski1215,0,Wed Jan 28 23:17:53 2015 UTC,The market here is insane. I haven't seen a wr250 for sale in a while. Drzs are rare on CL.
supermoto,2u0kjd,theRealCrazy,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:57:56 2015 UTC,"Wow $400 for a radiator. I am looking at OEM from a place and it is $70 a side, so $140 - 200 to replace both."
supermoto,2u0kjd,namesaredumb,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"From a ""place"", or from an authorized Aprilia dealer at suggested retail? Vastly different things.   I've always subscribed to ""if it was really that cheap and easy, why didn't the seller do it""."
supermoto,2u0kjd,spac3boy,2,Thu Jan 29 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Fix whatever is wrong with it and you'll have a much easier time. A high asking price plus expecting people to fix stuff on it as soon as they get home isn't going to sell it. If the market is as you say it is, a running bike in great shape means that most likely you'll have different offers so you can hold out for asking price and not haggle too much."
supermoto,2u0kjd,BickNlinko,0,Thu Jan 29 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is I am 18 I so if I tell people I did it my self it doesn't look the best to buyers and there are 2 shops that work on Aprils in Dallas. One has an insane wait time and the other charges $100 an hour. I would much rather give people the option to do it themselves and work on the sell price.  Also I think one of the hoses might be the problem, but this way it is worst case scenario."
supermoto,2u0kjd,BickNlinko,4,Thu Jan 29 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"Age has nothing to do with selling your bike. Besides if you know what your doing just change the oil. Order the radiator online and install it. Don't make any mention of it other than ""Fresh oil change, bike is ready to ride"" What you've replaced is of no concern to the buyer as long as you aren't hiding crash damage (which it doesn't look like you are).   Once the stuff is fixed your CL ad becomes much more appealing. My point is that any smart buyer is going to leverage damaged parts and needed work against you, which means you get less money in your pocket."
supermoto,2u0kjd,bootleggedfirework,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"I know what you said is the most practical thing to do, but every time I think of fixing it I think of all the shit that could go wrong and I put it off."

Also, Skid plates do great, they make aluminum, plastic, or carbon fiber. Aluminum is heaviest, the plastic is cheapest, CF is probably expensive.  There isn't really too much more you can do to protect the engine itself though. Maybe some radiator braces, keep them nice and straight upon a horizontal meeting with some pavement."

supermoto,2toelq,Ridethepig101,1 point,Mon Jan 26 10:49:50 2015 UTC,A lower seat and getting the suspension set for your weight will do wonders. I've never heard a good story of someone putting lowering links on a tard and keeping it like that.
supermoto,2toelq,Ridethepig101,1 point,Mon Jan 26 11:56:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about how to get the suspension set for my weight. Is that something a general mechanic could do? Or is it simple for me to do myself? I'm not sure what the correct suspension would look like for my weight at 125-130.
supermoto,2toelq,Ridethepig101,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:09:14 2015 UTC,A mechanic should be able to setup your suspension for you.  You are in the top of the range that stock suspension is capable of.

supermoto,2tgsln,Risky_Bizness,2,Sat Jan 24 17:42:19 2015 UTC,I used to live in the SF area and almost every Supermoto is ridiculously priced. If you want a good DRZ you'll be paying at least $4000. KTMs were all priced at at least 5k and that was usually for the ones with 20k+ on the odometer.

supermoto,2tfee6,sidewinderduck,2,Fri Jan 23 18:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's not a great deal, and not a bad deal.  Kind of middle of the road.  Wheels are Warp9 and cost around 1k plus the tires.  Front brake caliper seems stock as does the disc, which isn't really a good thing.  Back brake uses the Warp9 brake disc, interestingly enough.  Looking at it a bit more, i'd probably not pay that price.  You can pick up a 2015 EXC-F 350 for under 10k, new.  For around town, it wouldn't be bad, but it's going to be rather bad on the freeway.  The conversion to Supermoto, a semi-decent one, doesn't take long.  I run both dirt and SM on my 450 EXC and the swap takes me elss than 30 minutes, and i'm a lazy POS sometimes.  All it really is, is change the sprocket, swap the wheels, slap the spacer for the front brake on, align everything and you're done.  That's the basic setup, so you can totally do it in a parking structure.   To make it easier for you, and so you can get a general idea, check out Motostrano.  The kit i linked is super basic, but all you need to convert a street legal dirtbike.  If you go back and check out the other kits, you can spend more money and get more fancy, but it's not required.  I run Warp9 wheels and they're decent.  The rotors were VERY rough when new, but once broken in, they are alright.  Highly recommend getting Sintered brake pads or similar.  It'll help a lot with stopping distance compared to organic, especially with the stock brake caliper.  Hope that helps, cheers!"

supermoto,2tfee6,fake_tea,1 point,Fri Jan 23 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"To start with, I know jack about supermotos. I'm looking for something smaller than my current bike for commuting a short distance in a city and for goofing off around town. Ideally, I could take it to smaller/more technical tracks as well.  So I was considering buying a 500 EXC new and SMing it. However, I came across this new 350 EXC that the dealer(?) already converted. I don't know what parts are on it, but does seem reasonable? Anything I should watch out for? I live in the city, so my garage is a large parking space in a parking structure. Doing the actual conversion myself would either be difficult short of just having a shop do it for me, which I'm willing to do also."
supermoto,2tfee6,HyperTraveler,2,Fri Jan 23 18:32:32 2015 UTC,That bike looks great but if it's a strictly street ridden bike I would go for the 500. 350s are an awesome mix of light weight and power but I feel that's kind of wasted in a street application where a few pounds won't make a huge difference. Epic woods bike though I'd love to own one.
supermoto,2tfee6,fake_tea,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:38:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, makes sense to me. Do you have any recommendations on communities where I could dig into how to go about converting a 500?

supermoto,2tfee6,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"Some people will say that the 500 turns slower in the dirt, but that is more the reciprocating mass in the engine rather than the weight.  I haven't ridden the 350, so can't comment, but the 500 is amazing.  It handles like it's telepathically controlled, and the motor is a beast.  If I had SM wheels on it, I would get in so much trouble.  Maybe this summer."
supermoto,2tfee6,Dirt_Bike_Zero,1 point,Fri Jan 23 21:20:39 2015 UTC,As hyper said the bigger factor is reciprocating mass but my brother had a 525 woods bike that was absolutely awesome.

supermoto,2tfee6,Fokkusuhaundo1911,1 point,Fri Jan 23 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"That bike doesn't look ""converted"", they threw a set of inexpensive Warp9 wheels on a stock bike, plus they want to charge you $750 for the original wheels. MSRP for a 2015 350EXC-F is $9,999, so they're basically listing last years model for $200 over MSRP. Plus we don't know what size rear wheel is on there...you'll be bummed if it's like a 4.25"" . If all you want is a stock EXC with 17""'s, buy a leftover 2013 or 2014 for a decent discount and get some used wheels for it. That way you'll have the dirt wheels and the street wheels, plus you can get an over sized rotor for the 17's(which is the very least thing you should do to the brakes for supermoto use).  Plus I agree with /u/fake_tea , get the 500 for street use."

supermoto,2t66gg,SantiagoGT,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:20:02 2015 UTC,I want to get a Sumo but they are not available in my country (except for the extremely expensive KTM) how easy is it to convert a dirtbike? can I use cast rims? I know a guy that works in a junkyard and he gets a lot of dead motorcycles  I want to join the ranks...
supermoto,2t66gg,SantiagoGT,2,Thu Jan 22 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"Well, whatever dirtbike it is. It has to be a 4 stroke. Don't sumo a 2 stroke. You'd be rebuilding it at every oil change. So, pick a 4 stroke dirtbike. Google aftermarket parts to make it street legal for your country ( headlight, blinkers, taillight, etc. ) Now supermotos are obviously known for the 17 inch wheels. So, this is where it gets expensive. A set of excel wheels is around 1200$ - 1600$ (USD). Check ebay for the wheels. Also, you'll need a big brake kit for it. Meaning the front brake rotor needs to be able to slow you down from street/crusing speeds, so Google a big brake kit for your dirtbike of choosing. I'm not sure if I missed anything or not. If anyone else can think of anything by all means add to it."
supermoto,2t66gg,ImnoArsonist,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:33:11 2015 UTC,cool! I thought it was something far more easier... I was trying to avoid getting the wheels since they are probably the same price I paid for the dirtbike... and basically buying the dirtbike plus the kit would raise the price really high
supermoto,2t6z70,Troniar24,6,Wed Jan 21 18:08:56 2015 UTC,yall should stop recommending the 690 SMC if you havent ridden it. it's not like a DRZ really. it's way bigger

supermoto,2t6z70,jman4220,3,Wed Jan 21 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"WR450/690 are fuel injected, and thus are more powerful. Also, way easier to tune to match a performance exhaust or air filter. Plus the 450 is a lighter bike I think."
supermoto,2t6z70,IzoAzlion,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:20:39 2015 UTC,A WR450F is almost 50 pounds lighter than a DRZ400SM. My mostly stock WR dynos about 15 hp higher to the wheel than a stock DRZ400SM.

Other than that, it's 2006 so it should have the FCR 41 carb and doesn't have the clutch bearing of doom. Haggle the price down, get it and prepare to do some sick ass wheelies"
supermoto,2t2jh1,Irish-king,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say the bike is worth about $3-3.5K depending on your area/market and the condition of the bike. There are no real issues that I can think of with the bike(I had a 2004 625SMC). Like /u/Irish-king mentioned, the oil changes are a bit of a pain in the ass, but aside from that, the motor is pretty stout(as long as it was properly maintained and not over heated or run without oil or anything like that). Also, I checked my valves every other oil change(about every 5K), only once were they out of spec...they're tappet type valves so they're super easy to check and adjust. There are a few cheap mods that can be done to the bike to really wake it up, so see what the guy did to it."

supermoto,2t2jh1,BickNlinko,1 point,Tue Jan 20 20:06:55 2015 UTC,"The popular mods are to open up the top of the airbox and remove the snorkel(super easy), remove the throttle stop(probably already done) re-jet the carb and change the throttle needle using the JD Jet Kit JDK007(pretty easy if you follow the instructions included with the kit), remove the pea-shooters from the exhaust(a bit more difficult but very doable at home, here are some instructions). I also removed the SAS(secondary air system) from my 625. Here are the instructions and part numbers you need to remove the SAS plus a bunch of other tips and tricks.   I really liked my 625, the only reason I sold it was because I had another street bike so  it never got ridden, and I needed money for a new supermoto race bike. In fact, another redditor bought it. I hope he's happy with it."
supermoto,2t2jh1,BickNlinko,2,Tue Jan 20 20:45:53 2015 UTC,"So I ended up buying it! Thanks for the mod list. He said he already removed the throttle stop, he also gave me the tools (drill bit) to do the exhaust mod. What is the SAS mod about and I assume I can re-jet the carb on my own?"
supermoto,2t2jh1,BickNlinko,1 point,Wed Jan 21 02:59:38 2015 UTC,"Nice! Happy new bike day!   The SAS mod just removes the secondary air system. It doesn't add any performance, but it does clean the motor up a bit and helps stop the popping under decel issues. Here is some more SAS info. If your bike still has the carbon canister and shit you should rip all that crap off. The SupermotoJunkie forum post I linked to previously has all that info.   The LC4 motor was pretty popular, so you'll be able to find all sorts of tips and info.   You can re-jet the carb on your own no problem. Get the JD Jet kit JDK007 and follow the instructions that come with it. You don't need to remove the carb, just drain it, loosen it and turn it towards the left side of the bike. You will need to remove the tank to change the needle though, but thats only three bolts."

supermoto,2t0qog,CharlesFrancisX,2,Tue Jan 20 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Why would you want to trade that exhaust for the big heavy stocker? That thing was probably like $300-$400, the full system(if it has it) was probably closer to $600. Keep it and hide the scrapes with a trock homemade exhaust slider(some small radiator hose from the auto parts store and a big hose clamp). If it's too loud, try repacking it. I use the Fly Racing repacking blankets(you'll need two) , not the bag of loose shit."
supermoto,2t0qog,BickNlinko,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"I repacked mine a few weeks ago and it's still loud as hell compared to the stock exhaust. Thankfully I don't ride for any amount of time that it really gets to me but the constant drone could totally get annoying.   Also, it seems OP is from California which means you have to have a stock exhaust to pass inspection (emissions and sound) and also they're much less lenient your exhaust being extra loud when you're out and about even after inspection."
supermoto,2t0qog,awittygamertag,2,Tue Jan 20 22:26:31 2015 UTC,"Also, it seems OP is from California which means you have to have a stock exhaust to pass inspection (emissions and sound) and also they're much less lenient your exhaust being extra loud when you're out and about even after inspection.    There is no inspection for bikes in CA for anything(unless you're trying to register an out of state vehicle, in which case they look for the 50 state emissions sticker at the DMV, or unless you're registering a salvage title or a home made bike).   Also , you'll never get pulled over for just having a loud exhaust, unless you live in some weird very rural area where the cops have nothing better to do. With that said it is technically illegal to modify just about anything on any of your vehicles, unless the parts are C.A.R.B certified(most are not), however neither myself nor anyone I know have had their balls busted for having a reasonable aftermarket exhaust on their bike.   You really have to get caught doing something else and then they try to tack on every possible offense to beef up the fine, and even then most cops don't give a shit as long as you're not running straight pipes."
supermoto,2t0qog,BickNlinko,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:35:07 2015 UTC,I was not aware of the first one. I'll keep that in mind. I just assumed it was the same for in-state registration too.
supermoto,2t0qog,awittygamertag,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"Even for out of state bikes they don't test the emissions or anything, they just make sure that you've got that emissions sticker from the factory on there somewhere. There is no SMOG check for bikes, at all, no matter what. For salvage bike and home made bike inspections done by the CHP they can use a dB meter for your exhaust, but I've  never heard of them doing it. Like I said, your bike's exhaust would have to be pretty over the top loud for them to give a shit."

supermoto,2sub19,Marbro_za,7,Sun Jan 18 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"Cool, to me, means safe and respectful.    Safe means practicing your stunts wearing full gear, starting at slow speed.  The bike is more stable at higher speed, but the consequences for a mistake are catastrophic.  Learn to do wheelies in first gear with proper rear brake control.   Then, you will be ready to do impressive wheelies at any speed.  Respectful means that there are good places to do wheelies and bad ones.  Doing wheelies in front of houses and in traffic makes you an asshole, not cool.  The cool guy doesnt need an audience to make himself feel good.  Riding respnsibly requires a lot of self denial.  People that realize this point are cool to me, and the ones I personally choose to ride with."

supermoto,2sub19,bscb,3,Sun Jan 18 18:00:28 2015 UTC,Lean back and keep your arms straight. Feel like you about to loop? Probably not. It helps to get a buddy to practice with you who can tell you how far you really are from balance point.  COVER THE REAR BRAKE
supermoto,2sub19,bscb,1 point,Sun Jan 18 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"Been told to keep the foot on the rear brake at all times. Do i have to yank on the bars?  Which is better, Clutch up or power?"
supermoto,2sub19,H8Blood,2,Sun Jan 18 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"In first gear, not really. In second on my bike, maybe a tug. You have to get a feel for it. I feel like you have enough power to boot to not have any trouble in 1 and 2.   Power wheelies wear out the clutch (a little) less than clutch wheelies. But, that is if you're doing the clutch-ups correctly. Learning clutch up wheelies may be harder on the clutch, but this method brings the front up less abruptly. Power wheelies, especially in first, are easier to execute, but are harder to maintain because of how fast they come up. Personal preference!  edit- forgot to mention, clutch up wheelies can be done from a slower speed and make higher gear wheelies possible. Second gear power wheelies may come up two or three inches while clutch up second gear wheelies can be brought to balance point.   Practice makes perfect, but be geared up and do this on a closed course."
