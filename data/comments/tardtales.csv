A few weeks into the school year we our nice old Teacher ( we'll call her mrs. T ) announced to the class that wed be going to the computer lab to start a little project  Mason had been completely normal up to that point  We walked to the computer lab and mrs. T assigned us all seats and helped us boot up the computers  The students opened up the web browser and got onto some game that teaches young children how to use the keyboard properly  Everything was going smoothy, until i started hearing groans coming from mason ( who was just one seat away from me )  ""Whats wrong mason "" i asked curiously  ""MAI SPACEY CEY IS BORKEN !!"" Translation: ""my space key is broken""  My elementary school had rather old stuff, so a few broken keys on a keyboard was normal  ""Oh"" i responded, being in first grade i had no idea what to do  ""FUAJJJGKELQLMDMFMKA ""  mason let out a vicious roar and picked up the keyboard and smashed it against the desk with the strength of 1000 stampeding bulls  Some of the children screamed and cowered under the desks in fear, they had never seen such acts of violence  I cowered under my desk too because the fucker was raging right next to me  Mrs. T quickly ran over to mason and screamed ""MASON WHAT ARE YOU DOING !! IM GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE YOUR COLOR TO ORANGE""!   The school has a conduct chart where if a child misbehaves they get their color moved down. It starts at green>yellow>orange>red>purple. The worse they behave the farther it goes   The color change angered Mason even more, he picked up his backpack hurled it at mrs. t , hitting the poor old lady hard  Mrs. T stomped over to the phone and called who i assumed to to be some wranglers, who where quickly on the scene  The wranglers grabbed mason and gave him a penny (for some reason that calmed him down)  ""gIMME MOAR PENNY GIMME MOAR PENNY""  Wtf.BRRES  Mrs. T quickly gathered me and the other spooked children and took us to another classroom where we where safe from Masons rage  As we sat in the classroom we waited in silence  mason was dragged down the hall by wranglers, screaming in tard language"

tardtales,33l91m,Noctuaaa,6,Tue Apr 28 00:24:01 2015 UTC,"I have this one guy who I support. I'll call him ""Een."" Een is a twenty-eight-year-old man who has an autism spectrum disorder, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (basically, the two hemispheres of his brain don't make connections to each other very well), ADHD, and some other issues. He's a prime example of how learned behaviors/lack of being taught responsibility has created a fucking monster.  Een super talkative and likes to socialize in general. He does not have the ability to always filter what he says, I'll give him that. Usually poor ability to filter what he wants to say leads to unintentionally racist or generally insensitive remarks. This guy is super independent, has the ability to walk/talk/hold a job/eat by himself/whatever. He does have a history of violent behavior (he apparently beat the shit out of a staff at the agency he used to get services from. All the staff was doing was trying to help him clean his room). Een, by some divine prank, saved a kid from drowning at a public pool once (although all he really did was move the kid from the water to the side of the pool while staring at him awkwardly; didn't even do CPR or anything like that), and somehow his dumbfuck mother seems to think that him doing that makes him exempt from ever being called out on socially acceptable behavior.   It is my job to support my clients on their way to being the most independent that they can possibly be. Realistically, Een is able to keep his room tidy/respect the personal space of others. I hold my clients to very specific standards based on their personal abilities, so I hold Een to a pretty high standard because, as a professional, I know that Een has the potential for the closest possible ""normal"" life out of all of the people at our group home. If his room is messy and looks like shit, I expect him to clean it. If I say ""hey, your room isn't looking very good, can you please clean it and then you can go do -desired activity-?,"" I expect it to be done. When Een goes back to clean it and it isn't done well, he instantly calls his mother and makes up a bullshit story about how I yelled at him/I'm constantly singling him out/how I got in his face. When he's doing something that I am not happy with, like him giving me hugs without my permission, I tell him to stop and he flips his shit. Does the same thing; calls his mom, makes up a story. His mother expects us to coddle him and do what he pleases because ""he has a disability.""  ??????????????  How does this make any sense?"
tardtales,33l91m,Noctuaaa,4,Tue Apr 28 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"Or fucking Finkelstein. He has a plethora of socially questionable habits that, although I know it's probably for naught, I have desperately trying to correct for his own sake.  Never EVER does Finkelstein say ""please"" or ""thank you"" for anything. I could be for anything from care he requests (or ""demands,"" I should rather say) to purchasing something at a store. I've gotten to the point that I ignore him until he asks me to please do something, and I always say ""THANK YOU"" after I've done something for him. It never fails to piss him off and I always hear him cursing under his breath.  He STARES. Always. Always fucking stares. He stares at me while I'm doing things at the house. He stares at people when we're out in public. When I point it out to him or ask him to stop, he feels the need to swear at me.  Finkelstein also thinks that he can wear whatever he wants out in public? Like, technically, he does, but he really should be conscious of his appearance when he's going out to church/going out to eat. Yesterday, another staff member was helping Finkelstein get dressed for church. Staff suggested that he wear some nice pants and a nice shirt to church. I could hear Finkelstein swearing from across the house: ""I don't want to wear fucking slacks, you motherfucker! I'm going to wear my goddamn comfy pants to motherfucking church!"" My poor staff was so irritated with him that he just put Finkelstein's sweatpants on, no underwear (per Finkelstein's demand), a pair of slippers, and a t-shirt with that said something along the lines of ""I like my sex like I like my coffee: hot and on the table."" Finkelstein came out and started waiting for his bus at the front of the house, and I told him that wearing something like that to church is not acceptable. I said that people already look at him like a different person because he's in a wheelchair and that going to church with his dick hanging out just makes him and every other wheelchair-bound person look bad. Finkelstein said, ""Well, I've gone to church other times like this. Why should I give a damn?"" I asked him if he would like to be remembered as the ""guy in the wheelchair with his cock hanging out at church"" or the ""nice-looking gentleman that likes going to church.""  Goddamn, man."

tardtales,32kov7,Smeagol3000,2,Thu Apr 16 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"How many hours a week do you work? Even if you only work 40 hours (which I doubt) means you make a little over 10 bucks an hour. Noctuaaa, you're a goddam saint; only someone who loves what they do could go through all that for so little compensation.  P.S. What kind of certification do you have to have?"
tardtales,32kov7,Tonnot98,3,Sat Apr 18 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"Full-time is 36 hours per week here. On average, I end up working between 40 and 50 hours per week since I end up filling in so often. I get paid very little. I'd rather get paid poorly for a job that I love than getting paid well for one I hate. I did study to be a teacher, but people with developmental disabilities are so heavily tied into the school for their early years that they lose a lot off the support that they require once they're above school-age (age 21 is the cutoff). I can take a lot of solace in the fact that I can give people the high-quality care and consistency they need as adults.  In my state, you must have a high school diploma or its equivalent, be CPR-certified, and complete a course to become an Official Medication Aide (this just lets us legally pass medications as delegated through a licensed nurse). We need to keep the CPR/OMA certs up-to-date. You may also be required to complete Person-Centered Thinking training, crisis prevention/intervention training, and behavior management training. You might need more training, you might need less. It really depends on the agency and the people you're supporting, though. There aren't really any national standards in place for direct support professionals yet."
