If you move onto (1,0), you move right on the horizontal line but your vertical position doesn't change. If you drew a line perpendicular (90 degrees) at every (x,0), you would get a lined piece of paper looking like this  | | | | | | | | | |  If you then moved back to the origin and did the same with all (0,y), you would end up with a grid.

I can see Kerry's problem.  What about all those Air Force fighter pilots we grew up around? All those Aces from WWII and Korea strutted like they had all the medals, and deserved them, too. Now that I think of it, I think that strut was more an artifact of flying than heroics. I think they were all drunk on youth and speed and g-forces.

MilitaryStories,3d9hc7,speakertobankers,5,Thu Jul 16 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"Medals?  Ha!    On my new set of Class A's (I'd built a stick-man effigy and dressed it in my old Class A's, soaked it in gasoline, and gave it a proper Viking-burial-at-land [where else would you bury a paratrooper?] when I ETS'd) that the California National Guard issued to me just prior to my third and final ETS, I had to google what my ribbons meant, and what order to arrange them in.  It's a pretty decent fruit salad.  Not bad for an E-5 with three service stripes and four combat/deployment/whatever-the-fuck-they-are.  Of medals/ribbons, I know about the ones I don't have.  Purple Heart.  Good Conduct Medal.  Should have two.  Anything higher than an Army Commendation Medal.  Supposedly I was put in for one with ""V-Device"", but it got lost and nobody, including me, cared.  Especially not the people responsible for seeing that those thing saw some follow-through.    My AAM (Army Achievement Medal) that I was awarded by my PL way back when I was a dumbass PFC, is my most cherished award.  I felt I'd earned that one.  I think I actually moved it to the top of my fruit salad for the Battalion Ball that was the last time I will ever wear that funny green suit."
MilitaryStories,3d9hc7,Bobafetta8007,10,Wed Jul 15 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"that was the last time I will ever wear that funny green suit.   I dunno. There's a shadow-box in your head, whether you want it there or not. Your children will want all of your ribbons, all of your medals. Might as well face that.  I loved my Good Conduct Medal. It only goes to enlisted. I earned mine before I went to OCS. So upon graduation, I was a newly-minted 90-Day-Wonder with - count 'em - TWO ribbons on my chest, NDSM and GCD.   That was important because there were all of these ""senior"" ROTC and Academy lieutenants walking around like college alone made them into warriors, confronted by these guys who had TWO ribbons and never even finished college! The rotcy guys hated that, but the real satisfaction was in the undisguised fury of the ring tappers. This was an outrage! I mean, two months ago their Academy decorations would have stretched from one pectoral to another, and now one measly ribbon! They simply could. not. STAND it! Very satisfying in a mean, petty, stupid trivial sort of way.  So yeah, I'm proud of my GCD. Not sure why I got it. I'm pretty sure it was for not having the guts to do anything of which the Army disapproved, which is, when you think of it, kind of a cheese-dick reason to get a medal. Let my ribbon testify, the Army had me thoroughly cowed. I had no guts whatsoever. I earned that medal.  And I think I used it in a manner appropriate to it's meaning - cheese-dicking rotcy and ring-tapping lieutenants.   But forget the medals, Grinder. Pass on that CIB, the parachute wings and the combat engineer badge. You did dangerous things and you blew things up, just for fun and spite. Can't do better'n that. Every boy's dream, no?"
MilitaryStories,3cvw48,calladus,23,Sat Jul 11 05:26:16 2015 UTC,"Command Post guy here. I used to work in a STRAT CP. (SAC got renamed US STRATCOM a while back, but it's still the same gig)  Great description of walking into the command post. I just wanted to chime in on a few things.    As I waited, I couldn't help but notice that there was a camera in a corner near the ceiling. I was being watched.   Yup. We got cameras in the entrapment area, stairwells, hallways.. just about everywhere so we can see who is lurking around outside the console and who is knocking on our door. It also gave us a nice ""heads up"" when the brass was coming down so we could straighten up.    This is all very nervous-making as no one is speaking to me while they had my identification. I presume they're calling Job Control, my NCOIC, and maybe the Pope himself to check my bonafides.   Nah, just bouncing your name off an Entry Control Roster and checking to make sure the thing you are there to fix is actually broken. If something was fishy they'd call back to your squadron to find out what you were doing there. No biggie. No need to involve the Pope...   I don't know what this place looked like when it was operating. Whenever I arrived, there was a curtain across the stage. I assume there was some sort of James Bond display of electronics and status boards updated by drones with grease pencils and head sets, all behind that curtain.   Yup, that's the CAT (Crisis Action Team) room. It's where the generals and colonels get together and monitor progress on important stuff. When the curtain gets pulled back we can throw data displays up on the wall. It's usually kept closed when not in use.    a red light in a cage above the door. I never saw the light lit up.   The red light goes on when we are decoding EAMs from STRATCOM. It basically lets everyone know we're busy so we don't have time to open doors, answer questions,  or any of the other stuff. It's a big ""leave us alone, we're busy"" light to keep officers the hell away from us for a bit. It is also a ""if you dont have a TS clearance, get the hell away from the console"" light.    And there was a RED PHONE   Sorry to burst your bubble. The red phone doesn't go to the president. It's the Secondary Crash net, which rings up Tower, Base Ops, Fire Dept, and SFS. It's used to relay information when an aircraft calls in with an Inflight Emergency....  If you want to talk to the president you gotta use the tan phone. :)   The tables had red ""TOP SECRET"" cover sheets strewn about over the top of papers    Its just classified checklists and instructions underneath. Nothing super cool or fun. I've said plenty of times before, most TS is boring shit anyway.   the Command Post - had become... noisy.    Yup, that means they were receiving message traffic from STRAT. At least 4 different systems start alarming with beeps, buzzers, rings, and audio cues. Happens more than a dozen times a shift. Drives the CP controllers batty as hell. Throws us into super-scurry mode as we flip on the red light and start the decode process.   and then he un-holstered his M9 and held it in a firing stance, but pointed at the ground.   Very wrong on the MSgt's part. The Senior Controller on duty has a 9mm, but it's only to be used in an emergency (read- the CP is being overrun by a threat here to steal TS material). It should never be unholstered unless it is needed to defend lives and/or material.   EAMs would come through at all hours at pretty random intervals. I've had to throw plenty of people out of the CP with a quickness. Never once had to use a firearm to do it. Most people understand when you simply tell them to get the fuck out because TS material is about to come out of the box. I've even thrown the Vice Wing Commander off the console (he had the security clearance, but he was annoying and in our way. We threw him back into the CAT)   ""Would you really have shot me if I refused to leave yesterday?""   From a STRAT CP guy my answer is simple. Shoot to protect nuclear related secrets. Yes. Shoot a comm guy who isn't moving as fast as I want him too? No. Not ever.   Besides, at our base the COMM guys were practically family. They spent almost as much time in the console area as we did (shit was always breaking and needing repair)   Thanks for all you do, and for keeping the CP up and running. Couldn't do our job without you. And sorry for some dipshit pulling a gun. That's completely inexcusable."
MilitaryStories,3cvw48,All_Secure,5,Sat Jul 11 18:03:54 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if it was a different time?  This was back in '91/'92?

Which makes the people in my workcenter assholes for not warning me of the possibility."
MilitaryStories,3cvw48,All_Secure,11,Sat Jul 11 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pre 1991 the USSR was still a thing. Cold war was still on. Imminent nuclear war was a constant threat. If memory serves, back in those days we kept a nuclear laden bomber in the air at all times ""just in case"" the soviets decided to launch something at us. So yeah, there would have been an extra ""pucker factor"" at the time, I'm sure.   Still, pulling a gun on a Comm guy simply because an EAM came over the system is ridiculous. I have no doubt it happened, and happened to other people in your shop, but I think that the MSgt in question was just a trigger happy blowhard. The only reason to shoot would be to protect nuclear secrets. You weren't even in the console area. You were nowhere near codes.   ""Leave your shit, get out."" should have been enough. If you were stubborn you would be physically removed using an appropriate amount of force. Pulling the M9 was over the top.   And yeah, you should have been pre-briefed. These days we give a briefing to visitors who enter informing them about the red light and the possibility that they may be asked to leave immediately without notice."

Plus our equipment was always breaking, HHQ was always up our ass to fix things out of our control. We dealt with a lot of TS crap that we couldn't tell our own wives about. And the nuclear shit was only part of our job. We also had to do the usual flight-following of aircraft and sending OPREPs and SITREPs to MAJCOM and STRAT.

The glass at the window was bullet proof. ID's were transferred in a steel drawer. The doors (which he correctly noted had no handles on the inside) were electromagnetically sealed. You would need a tank to bust through them. a regular battering ram wont do the job.   If Kadena had barrel sized holes it's probably exactly what he thought they were, so that they could shoot into the entrapment area to terminate a threat.   These days we just trap them in an inescapable box and call SFS, who will in turn enter the entrapment area with M-4's drawn, put the intruder on the floor, cuff him, and drag him off to a dark room in OSI for interrogation.

You could dial up any other CP or shop that had a similar phone. They got replacled by STEs and OMNIs. The tan phone had a funky name to it. KIV or some shit. It was auto-keyed for TS and had several HHQ agencies on speed dial. STRAT was one. NMCC (National Military Command Center: read President/CJCS) was another.

MilitaryStories,3c7xq8,moving0target,22,Sun Jul 5 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"So, my stories aren't spectacularly interesting when it comes to confirmed kills and heavy contact and all of the war-porn that people expect.  I've had some experience with WIA's.  I've shot at people.  I killed one guy, maybe two.  Maybe more.  Guy isn't a fair term.  They were Taliban.  They were soldiers.  I don't have to like them, but I can't speak about them without giving them the respect they deserve.  How to talk about it?  How do I feel about it?  When I think about the one that I know for sure, not a confirmed kill but I know in my guts that I killed him.  How to tell that story?  Usually I don't.  I talk about my time in the Army, deployed and garrison, freely if it's relevant to the conversation.    I've had people ask me if I've killed anybody.  Usually I change the subject.    I've had people ask me that in a way that made the question seem to hope for an enthusiastic affirmative.  I clam up or get sort of angry at that.  I've had people ask me in a way that was natural to the conversation.  I was first to put rounds out, with my MK19.  I was in the lead gun-truck.  We were taking RPG-7's and small arms fire.  I actually had one RPG barely miss my turret as I was trying to get a fix on the situation.  I saw a small puff of dust on the hillside opposite the valley we were in.  In my mind, it was from another gunner marking targets with fire.  This happened very quickly, as contact had just started.  I turned my turret and put the muzzle of my Mark about high enough to engage at ~400m.  I put a burst out, two or three rounds so that I could adjust after they impacted.  They were right on.  I put out another 3-5 round burst, and another before the gun jammed.  Long story short, during the AAR (After Action Review) it turned out that I was the first gunner to engage.  That meant that that puff of dust on the hillside could only have been back blast from a Talib firing and RPG.  All of my rounds were on target.  We didn't have the  AAR until a day or two or three later when we were back at the FOB.  That was when I learned that I'd killed a man.  Part of me felt good, but the rest of me got really, really heavy.  I didn't sleep well.  I had weird dreams.  I sat on the stoop of my quarters smoking and wondering who he was, if he had a family, what his brothers-in-arms would tell his mother and father.  What they found of him?  he had to've been blown to hell.  I still think about him, weekly at least.  I feel a sadness about it, but no remorse.  Maybe remorse in the sense that I wish that situation had never happened.  It makes me sad, sometimes.  Sometimes I laugh about it, because I'm pretty sure he almost nailed me with that RPG.  He would have been a lot better off if he'd been a better shot than me.  Sorry, got a little sidetracked, but I think at least sidetracked in the vein of the OP."

MilitaryStories,3c56zm,RantNRave31,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm just some guy writing on the internet. We are legion.   I daily find myself questioning whether I am worthy to lead the young men and women that report to me.   I wasn't worthy. I was just ready. I'm pretty sure I didn't inspire those mortarmen in Attention to Orders to leave safety and put their lives in peril. They had just finished H&I fires. Most of them were outside of the mortar revetments heading for doss. Then all that incoming drove them to seek cover.  Here's the deal. These are all twenty-something young men. Mortarmen. They were already off their guns, but it felt like someone had chased them away from their tubes - the ultimate insult for indirect-fire machismo. They were hot to go. Tiny Tim could have warbled ""Fire Mission!"" and they would've come running, because y'know, Fuck this ""take cover"" shit! Let's go KILL someone!  You lead because you're the designated leader. They follow your orders because that's what they've trained to do. And believe me, if there's a fight, that's what they want to do. They can't do their jobs unless you do yours. Be ready to do your job, because they will more or less insist that you do it. They are willing to hurt you to get you up and moving. Worthiness has little to do with it.  And yet, I said that leading those people was ""an honor worth your life."" So it is. Believe that too. It's just not the kind of honor you seem to be thinking of. There's a gang of people who eagerly want to murder someone running towards you, and they expect you to help them do that. Woo! They won't take ""no"" for an answer.  Don't get me wrong. There are leaders who are worthy and inspiring. I met more than a few. Wrote about one of them - called him Hotspur. There is some commentary on that submission about the difference between natural leaders and those of us who were out in front only because we needed to outrun the crazy people behind us.   reflect service that was truly sacrifice.   Yeah, the sacrifice-service train is not optional either. I know people who had prepared all their lives for that sweet moment - dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - sought it out, and it never came. Same train visited your Grandpa more than a few times in the OP, no? He rode it out. That's about all you can do.  Don't undersell yourself, OP. You're Grandpa should've gotten a silver belt buckle for that ride. These things run in the blood. You'll do fine. You may not survive it, but you'll do fine."
MilitaryStories,3c4f3x,calladus,20,Sat Jul 4 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the mysterious TSgt was a classified courier of some sort.   I was a 1C3X1 and had a TS clearance. I also had to get trained and certified as a classified courier because I had to take codebooks and COMSEC crypto to different locations. Basically you go through the training and get issued a card that is kept in your wallet along with military ID. Also had to haul around the ""oh so inconspicuous"" briefcase in which classified material is usually carried.   Anytime we had to courier classified material off base we usually wore civvies and tried to look as 'un-military' as possible. Especially if going through an airport or anyplace like that. Hawaiian shirts were pretty decent for that.   The only downside was that these days the 'inconspicuous' brief case has a big laminated paper slapped on the outside declaring the contents to be matters of national security and protected from search.   If a cop pulls you over while driving and asks what is in the case, or if airport security wants to pop it open and take a look, you show them the courier card and very politely explain that they will be prosecuted if they open it.   ""I'm not at liberty to say"" and/or ""I can't discuss that"" are preprogrammed responses to ""Whats in the case"" ""what are you carrying"" or ""what do you do for a living?""  The last question isn't classified, but its easier to go with ""I cant talk about that"" than explaining what your actual job is, and this is only a tiny part of it.  Most TS stuff is disappointingly boring anyway."

MilitaryStories,3c4f3x,tremblane,13,Sun Jul 5 06:27:23 2015 UTC,"This was told to me by a co-worker whose sister is (was?) in the US Navy doing that type of work. The story went that she was going through a TSA checkpoint and for whatever reason there were a couple of Navy security types escorting her at least as far as the checkpoint. The TSA agent tried to get touchy with the briefcase, at which point the Navy brute squad had the agent on the ground on his face, guns drawn."
MilitaryStories,3c4f3x,All_Secure,8,Sun Jul 5 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"I think that story is a slight exaggeration. Security escort isn't unheard of, but usually couriers try to keep a low profile. While I do believe there are TSA stupid enough to grab at a case, I'll even go on a limb and say security would physically stop them...  I have a hard time believing guns would be drawn on the TSA agent.   Again, stuff like that makes a scene. Two, you don't shoot someone in the face just for touching a case. Three, you don't shoot someone in the face even if they open the case. Four, you dont shoot someone in the face even if they read your document or play with whatever cool gizmo is being transported.   There's a process for dealing with those sort of things. A very boring and unimpressive process which I won't talk about, but it doesnt involve shoving a gun in anyone's face or utilizing a brute squad to muscle past security."

The only time I've flown with classified material it was a mil-mil flight, so I didn't have to interact with civvy airways.   If the courier is smart they'll just tell the TSA that they want to speak with a federal LE. Most airports have some kind of Fed hanging around. Show the courier card & military ID to the Fed. Odds are you will get an escort through security and onto the jet."

Every day he received a TS message from someplace to be delivered to a certain work center.  Every day, TSgt Duffy would arrive from that work center to pick up the message.    The procedure was the same every day.  Check the list of approved recipients, check TSgt Duffy's ID against the list.  My friend, SSgt Bag became friendly with TSgt Duffy, and they talked briefly about various things every day he showed up.  Then one day, TSgt Duffy showed up, and SSgt Bag gave him the message without verifying the list or the ID.  Twenty minutes later, TSgt Duffy brought the message back to the secure message center, and told them he had made a mistake.  Since he was outprocessing, he was no longer on the list of approved recipients.  He had picked up the message out of habit, and was returning it, unread.  Because SSgt Bag had not checked the list against TSgt Duffy's ID that day, he was demoted to SRA, lost his security clearance, and no longer qualified for reenlistment.  He spent his last 2 years in the Air Force basically doing KP and weeds and seeds - or whatever grunt work his commander gave him.  I have no idea what happened to TSgt Duffy - if anything."
MilitaryStories,3c4f3x,All_Secure,5,Mon Jul 6 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"Ouch. That's pretty rough.   When I was the SORTS guy I had to pass/receive classified info from units all the time. It was the same POC's from each unit, so you got very familiar with faces and names.   After initially checking them out in JPAS to verify their clearance (they shouldn't have been given this job unless they had at least a SECRET anyway, but we double check to make sure their commander isn't smoking crack) we prettymuch knew who they were and what they could and couldn't have as far as information goes. Changes in clearance are rare.  I didn't get ""read out"" of everything until literally the last hour and last day on base. I signed all the nondisclosure stuff and the other paperwork relieving me of my clearance level, then went into the restroom to change out of my ABUs and into civvys. Got in my car and was on the road as a private civilian directly afterward.   Had to return to that area a few months later for unrelated matters. I dropped by the old CP to say hi to everyone. It was the exact same as I left it. Classified junk open and all over the place. Messages coming through.  Nobody was ducking and diving to cover stuff up when I came through. I knew everyone. Everyone knew me. No point in covering up documents that I had seen a zillion times before, or closing up OPLANS that we all had memorized.  SSgt Bag got a raw deal IMHO.

Back in the mid-90's, a certain midwestern University Hospital was revamping its parking rules. Basically, the close spots were going to be for patients and the staff would have to park about a block away. So one day, Dr. So-n-So comes storming into the Parking and Transportation office DEMANDING to see the boss.   ""No, you know what, I see him through the glass, I'm not waiting."".   You didn't just storm in to see Dave. Ever. Not that it would have changed the outcome. But I digress.  Dr. So-N-So proceeded to pontificate for several minutes regarding his importance. About how he not only saved lives, but he was going to deduct his ""additional commute time"" from his workday, which would cost the University X amount of dollars, and oh by the way, ""WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN SOMEBODY DIES BECAUSE I'M NOT THERE!!!!""  The good Doctor was actually kind of a big deal, so Dave picked up the phone, called the President Of The Hospital and explained the situation. ""Yes, I see. OK. You have a nice day too"".  ""Mr. Hospital President says you're replaceable. You can give your resignation letter to your department head.""  Watching that Dr. walk out with a look of utter bitch slapped defeat was one of the best 10 seconds of my life."

I was in the hole trying to take off some siezed up bolts and was hunched over trying not to gag on the smell.  My sergeant was on top monitoring gas because our unit had a policy that only Staff Sergeants and above could monitor gas for a confined space entry.  Well I feel water on the top of my back followed by two quick thuds.    A turd and a bloody tampon and some toilet paper.  The rage and hate was indescribable; the whole world had just conspired to throw a turd and bloody ass tampon at me, and I am still stuck in this stank ass pit covered in blood and shit and piss!

I was sitting passenger side in the Jeep, we were on a two-lane blacktop. The driver suddenly says ""Watch this..."" and swerved to the right where an old fellow was trudging along with a wooden yoke across his shoulders with two ceramic jars balanced on the ends. Just walking along minding his own business when the asshole driver ran the Jeep into one of the jars which instantly broke causing the opposite jar to fall and bust wide open (rice).

It tooks weeks of pleading with them to knock it off and more weeks to convince them that I wasn't flipping out because it would be counter-productive. I wasn't demanding that somebody hand me a liver because I'm not a surgeon. I wasn't demanding a higher spot on the transplant list because my number was my number and I'm not really into assasinating the folk above me or threatening them to withdraw from the program.  To tell you the truth, I'm only worried about one single thing. The anti-rejection meds will render my immune system dead. I will suddenly be susceptible to every disease that every filthy 6-year old is sneezing at me.  I would rather spend 10+ years of slow healing than a lifetime of anti-rejection meds.  My number is very low on the list. This infuriates my ex-wives but they're slowly understanding that the lower I am on that list, the healthier my doctors believe that I am. And, nothing is going to change that unless I start dying. I'd rather not do that even if it does advance me to the top of the list.

I think some Somalian cootie got in your liver and bided its time until the alcohol softened things up. If I can write about some fat, soft lawyer's adventures in the VA Psych ward 15 years after he mustered out, and still call it a military story, you can write about this. That's my vote - I think OP has earned the right to tell us what happens after Somalia.   I see that some other readers are chiming in with stories. I think life after military service is relevant to the subreddit. I am not open to the suggestion that all of OP's troubles are due to mere alcohol. Don't think so.  Secondly, how the fuck do you get not one, but two ex-wives to go to bat for you? I suspect the Fyseek Tech has more uses than funny stories. I sit in awe.  Ten years, huh? Oooof.

MilitaryStories,38uwqq,a_junebug,16,Sun Jun 7 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"Fine :>(  If nobody's going to ask questions, I'll just answer the crap that nooooobody asked.  I'll start with the cause. Alcohol. Now I won't claim that I was never a heavy drinker. I certainly had my days, weeks, and months but, for the most part, a couple of drinks made an evening. The problem is that apparently 26 years of a couple of drinks a night, every night can cause cirrhosis just as easily as 10 years of heavy drinking. Because alcohol was the cause, a few things are important. The one that concerns me most is that alcohol induced liver failure is one of the slowest to heal. And that's if it heals. In my case, it has started healing but very very slowly. And, the part that is healing, while it's important in function, it does nothing for the cosmetic side of things (more on that i  a minute). The other thing is that the transplant board requires that I enroll in alcohol rehabilitation. In my particular case, I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since the diagnosis (that's a small lie that I'll clear up in a another minute). Doesn't matter to the rehab team or board. They need documentation showing that I have enrolled in alcohol rehab.   Cosmetics: sure, it's vain to think and worry about it but damn. For one, there's skin yellowing. I don't have that and wouldn't really be able to tell anyway being colorblind. I only know that I don't have it because my most-recent ex-wife is my transplant buddy. She takes me to the transplant team meetings, helps with appointment scheduling, has medical power of attorney to pull the plug and otherwise make medical decisions on my behalf. I'm glad that she was willing to participate. However, she can't be financial power of attorney. Just because we share a last name, most people we meet assume we're married. Sometimes we corre t them. Others it isn't worth the trouble. However, her company knows that we aren't married anymore and being that she's my financial planner and stock broker, there is a conflict of interest with her being the financial POA. That has been delegated to my daughter. The daughter isn't medical POA because nobody knows if she'd be able to make the decision to pull the pkug but we joke that the ex-wife wouldn't hesitate to do it over a hangnail.  I suppose that none of that has anything to do with cosmetics except the not-yellowing for the skin or eyes.  However, what does make a difference is the abdominal swelling. When it first started, I would go to the hospital every 45 days to get drained (paracentesis). That rapidly became once a month because it's pretty damned uncomfortable to have all that fluid. Plus, I can't eat without throwing up when there is no space available for food. Over time, this has caused me to lose all body fat and quite a bit of mussle mass. Once a month became every three weeks because the hospital was starting to get alarming amounts of fluid off me.  At its peak, they were getting 11 liters off me. That's 22 pounds of fluid that I carry around everywhere I go. And, it's all concentrated in my abdomen. Crouching to get something off the bottom shelf becomes an exercise in frantically searching for something to help me pull myself back up. Bending at the waist is far easier and nearly guaranteed to result in a continuous fart until I stand back up."
MilitaryStories,38uwqq,GoodLeftUndone,14,Sun Jun 7 03:50:13 2015 UTC,"Paracentesis: So, I'm up to once a week drains. Evidently, drawing 11 liters off of me is fairly dangerous as it affects kidney function. That and my blood pressure drops to about 60. That's the top number. Nobody seems to give a damn about the bottom number. But 60 is kinda fucking low. Like tunnel-vision, ear-ringing, white-skin low. They won't let me leave the hospital until it's above 90. Still pretty low but good enough for them. I bring a lunchbox full of snacks these days. I'm usually starving after they get the fluid off because there's suddenly all this space where food is supposed to go.  I bring bribes for the nurses and especially my tech who oversees the procedure.  This started as just for the tech because she fucking hurts me. Not with any of the equipment but cleaning me during prep. She would scrub my skin so hard that I felt like crying. I brought her cookies one day and told her, ""If you can find a way to NOT hurt me during prep, the cookies are yours."" I should also mention that my regular tech is a big girl. And, I mean big big. Maybe 300 pounds and 5 foot 5. Big girl. Likes her sweets. No more painful preps.  I also started bringing the nurses treats. Let me tell you, those treats pay off in spades. I get amazing service. I usually don't have to wait in the waiting room for an escort to the procedure area. The receptionist just calls, tells them I've arrived, and tells me to go on back to my regular room. The nurses meet me with hot blankets fresh from the oven and I hand over brownies or cookies or whatever goodies I made for them the night before. I steal a rolling table when I come in because my tech has a habit of stealing mine for her sterile field and all her supplies.  I once had to take the table from an occupied room. The lady was sound asleep and had enough tubes hooked up to her that she was clearly not going to be needing the table. My te h scolded me and told me, ""That woman is dying!""  ""Well, she doesn't need the table then, does she?""  Here's the routine once I get situated. The tech removes my blankets so that I can truly appreciate the fact that they keep the hospital at temperatures that would make a meat freezer proud. Then, she scrubs my side with alcohol and some ice-cold liquid in a wand. Drapes me in blue surgical sponges and a big-assed sterile sheet with an opening over the procedure area. Then she gathers the lidocaine and fills the syringe with it and calls the cutter.  I rated a surgeon the first time. And an operating room! By the third time, I was down to a physician's assistant and a few times a student.  They come in, put on the surgical gown, get gloved up by my tech, and then they hurt me real bad.  The lidocaine is like a branding iron and it lasts for about 15 seconds. It sucks.  To top it off, when the PA did the procedure the first two times, she missed the skin. Went way too deep and injected the lido where it wouldn't do anything. Then comes the scalpel. Were you aware that a scalpel is fairly unpleasant when it goes through your skin? Myself, I'm well-aware because I've felt it a few times.  The first time, I winced real bad and she stopped to give the lido another couple of seconds to work. Then I winced again and she stopped again. I finally burst with ""Don't stop! Just cut it!""  See, cutting only takes 1 second. The lidocaine takes 15 seconds. I have been discussing the experiment of just going without the lidocaine and just taking the scalpel raw. She suggested that she would one day, as a surprise, inject the lido one place and then cut me in a different place so that I would be able to make an accurate comparison. I instantly regretted telling her about my idea. And, I hope that she follows through one day. If they hurt the same, I'll take 1 second of agony over 15 seconds any day.  At any rate, I trained her on how to do the injection by going in at an angle so that she had more space to work in inside the skin layer where all those pesky nerves are. I told her that if she doesn't see me clenching my teeth and every muscle in my body and holding my breath, odds are that she's missed. She coaches me to breath during the shot. And, I call her filthy names through my clenched teeth.  We make a good team like that.  Once the incision has been made, they take a giant needle and drive it into the new hole and through the abdominal muscles. Then  they pull the giant needle back out leaving behind a catheter tube sticking out of my side. That's it. The surgeon or PA or student does just about 18 seconds of work and leaves. For this, my insurance pays them $700.  The PA usually sticks around for a while because, just like here, I tell stories and we chit chat. I've had other patients fro  across the hall yell, ""and then what happened!? Why did the story stop there!?"" And my nurse, tech, or PA has had to call back, ""Give him a second. He's getting an injection.""  Like I was saying, the cutter leaves and the tech hooks one end of the catheter to a tube and connects the tube to a bottle with a fairly high vacuum pressure. This sucks 1.1 liters out of me and then she switches bottles to another empty. Being drained once a week means that I only fill up 5 or 6. As soon as I pass number 5, I have to get an IV of albumin. It's a protein so that my kidneys don't freak out. Interestingly enough, albumin is also the white stuff that you see all gloopy-like on cooked lobster.  When I've got no more fluid to be drained, usually indicated my severe discomfort as the vacuum bottle attempts to draw my intestines though the catheter and the ultrasound machine no longer showing puddles, they effectively punch me in the gut as they pull the catheter out ""so I don't feel it."" I put an end to that little trick in a hurry. ""I'm the guy suggesting a raw scalpel! Stop punching me in the gut or the treat parade ends."" They stopped punching me in the gut.  What have I missed? I know it's a wall of text but I'm pretty sure I could continue for another hour of text but maybe not tonight. It's getting late and I finally have my sleep schedule where I want it.  I should also mention that I'm using a new tablet to type all of this. I have a bad habit of missing the keys on the bottom row and hitting the spacebar instead. I turned off autocorrect because it was coming up with bizarre substitutions. So, if you see a word that doesn't make a lick of sense. Look at the next word and the bottom row of keys on your keyboard. Odds are that one of those letters inserted between the two nonsense words will make a single word that fits a little better."
MilitaryStories,38uwqq,stillhousebrewco,13,Sun Jun 7 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"What the fuck does 22 pounds of fluid look like? Before: before  After: after  Alcohol rehab: After explaining to the transplant team that I hadn't had a drink since 9 Sep, they explained that nobody cared. The only thing that mattered to the transplant team is that I've been alcohol free for 6 months and the only thing that the transplant board cared about was paperwork showing that I had enrolled in an alcohol rehabilitation program. They suggested a place around the corner and after avoiding it for months, I finally made an appointment. I was interviewed and given a cup to fill with piss. Everything seemed to be going smoothly. Then, I got the phone call.  The rehab place wants me to enter 6 weeks of inpatient rehab. That means going to their hospital and not leaving for 6 weeks. Fuck my bills, my yard, my dog. Stunned by this, I demanded to know why.  Urinalysis showed signs of alcohol in my system. Remember how I said that there was a little lie around me not touching a drop? I had used wine to make chicken marsala the night before. And, I found out a few things. For one, alcohol only cooks out after a good long boil i  the food and for two, when it cooks off, it goes into the air where the cook is breathing it in.  I also found out some other things. The test they used is called an ETG. I forget what it stands for but what's important is how it reacts. It is pretty clearly the false-positive test. It will flag cooking wine, mouthwash, rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and anything else containing alcohol. All it takes is for me to smell it and the etg test will pick it up. I had do e all of the false-positive things. I used cooking wine. I stuck around while it simmered. I use mouthwash before bed. I use hand sanitizer every time i walk into the hospital procedure area. And they douse me i  rubbing alcohol when they prep me for the procedure.  It turns out that there is also a blood test they can use to filter out all the false positives. It has the additional benefit of being able to detect three weeks in the past instead of the three days that the etg works.  I asked for the blood test to refute the urine test. Rehab place refused and said that I was being argumentative and contrary and that I needed to enter their 6 week inpatient program. I asked for a second opinion. They said that everybody is going to say the same thing and the transplant team was behind them i  the 6 week program.  I ended up having to get quite testy with my transplant coordinator for about an hour of demanding the blood test. She kept trying to tell me that I was making a big deal over everything. I kept trying to tell her that my bills aren't going to pay themselves, my yard wasn't going to mow itself and, my dog wasn't going to feed herself and let herself out i  the yard to shit. And, all that stuff costs real money when you're unable to work because you can't focus for more than a few minutes. I finally suggested that if it it wasn't as inconvenient and unnecessary as I was making it out to be, she should check into the 6 week program herself with me. We could be rehab buddies and she would probably get continuing education credit out of the deal as opposed to me getting nothing but trouble.  I got the blood test.  And, low and behold! Everybody stopped looking at me like I was a filthy liar. I have that fucking test result framed, by the way. i gave a copy of it to everybody I met for the next few weeks. Doctors, nurses, x-ray techs, receptionists, strangers.  ""HERE! I'M FUCKING CLEAN!""  Transplant board didn't care. They still need the paperwork saying I have enrolled.

Sometimes the gods give you a little push on that emotional path.  Mine came as I was filling sandbags on a hot, sunny day, trying to make a home for me and some of my guys in the dunes at Quang Tri. A light helicoper had been flying around the base perimeter.  No big deal. Lots of choppers, UH1B's flying naked without side doors and open, see-through bays. But this one made an ugly noise and kind of lurched in the sky about 1500 feet up. It twisted in the air, and out of the bay came this guy.  He was just hanging in the air some distance from the chopper, which oriented itself and rotored in to a hard, but not deadly landing in a rice paddy nearby. He just hung there, didn't seem like he was falling at all.  I kept waiting for the movie-ending. He opens his parachute. He spreads the wings under his arms and parasails. I was watching - he seemed to be falling so slowly. We were both coming to an unacceptable conclusion.  I was arguing with him. C'mon man. Stop that. You're falling faster. DO something! What? What should he do? I dunno. C'mon man! FLY! This can't happen just right here out in the open. Where's the dramatic tension? Where's the climactic music?  Nothing. Hollywood had been lying to me all those years.  He bounced. Came back up in the air with all the parts twisted and arms and legs doing things that are not possible. One bounce, then down.  Little pause, before the sounds of yells and engines starting up. Just silence. All I could think was People bounce?  Yes, they do. Just like that. Gone.  Good story, OP. Just like that. No warning. Some guy. Just gone."
MilitaryStories,37t6rr,AnathemaMaranatha,15,Sat May 30 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"It is weird the thoughts you have at these times.  ""People bounce?"".  If it wasn't so tragic, it would be the perfect dark comedy.  Everyone was trying to help.  He wasn't dead yet, but I knew it was hopeless.  He was crushed across the guts.  I'm not a doctor, but it just wasn't a survivable injury.  I would have helped, but sometimes the best thing you can do is stay out of the way.  Too many cooks spoil the broth.  So I watched the combat medic.  Very capable guy.  At first he ran, when he got close his sense of urgency vanished.  Going through the motions.  I could tell he was just going to make the guy comfortable as he could.  ""well, I'm going to be here a while, I might as well be comfortable too."""
MilitaryStories,37t6rr,Dittybopper,10,Sat May 30 19:16:12 2015 UTC,"Whoa up now... a leutnant filling sandbags... There's an animal I never laid eyes on.   I happened to witness a guy bounce once though, at a dropzone while skydiving in Kansas. The sound is what really affected me, which is just about impossible to describe but a solid crunching thud-thump it was, loud and kind of moist sounding. I'll never forget that sound. Bill had exited the Cessna at 9,500ft with three other jumpers, one of them my wife so I was observing the jump with binoculars. He did some air work with the other jumpers before a normal break off around 2000ft, at which point he should have deployed his main parachute like everyone else, He didn't.   He kept falling at something like 120+ MPH, my horror growing steadily as he got larger, now watching with eyes only. No main, no reserve. I knew his reserve had an automatic deployment device on it if he failed to open by 1500ft. Bill had been one of our problem students, never seemed to quite get into the swing of parachuting. Some had advised him to quit, others wouldn't jump with him. He had run into trouble a couple of months prior due to having an extremely low opening. This jump was like deja vu all over again.  Because of that low opening Bill had just completed a two-month jump prohibition given by the DZ owner (hoping he would just not show up again), he had been instructed to install an automatic opening device (AOD), an in-helmut low altitude warning beeper and to attend mandatory retraining before jumping at the DZ again.   This was that first jump after the probation period. He wasn't falling slow now, he was plummeting and tumbling, a streak practically. Then he impacted and that god awful sound followed. He did bounce, just once, but all I saw was a limb flop in an arc above the tall grass.  I wrote in my logbook that I thought he had committed suicide and that the low opening jump previous had also been an attempt, but he chickened out. He was an engineer and probably knew that it was fairly simple to defeat the AOD, one method being to press a finger over the hole on the unit that aided it in measuring altitude."

I was game. Besides, I had no one to command to do it for me. I filled a bunch of sandbags.  The guy who bounced was on the other side of the concertina wire from me. I don't remember the noise. I said it was quiet, but it really wasn't - helicopter noise, engine noise, all that firebase stuff. It's just that there was no new noise for a few seconds after he hit. Then a bunch of yelling and engines firing up. I just watched. No way I could reach him.  I have been pushed from the back of a C130 twice. I did not like it. I do not wish to ever do it again. If I decide to commit suicide, I will do it like an honest man and use a gun applied to some part that doesn't linger in agony before it checks out.

Also people were angry at him for being thoughtless and bringing all sorts of media crap down on the DZ. Its a business and his action didn't help, plus traumatizing people.

I am not allowed out of the house without one. I usually catch it before it amends other people's errors. Not this time. Sorry.  When I was a kid, suicide was presented as an honorable option of last resort - the gun left on the table with one bullet in it, the hara-kiri death of a samurai, kill as many indians as you can but save one bullet for yourself, and so on. People would understand, would admire your courage even, and move on.  God, that is such bullshit. It is almost impossible to kill yourself without wounding or even killing others.

The reasoning being that if there was a fire the regular foam would damage the aircraft since it was designed for civilian planes, but the prop wash would change the PH or something to match military specs.  The sent me to the flight line to go find it.    I stopped where the f-16's were parked since it was the first shop on the road and asked them first.  One of them suppressed a giggle as he informed me that f-16's don't have props and so they didn't have any.  I asked him what planes on base had props and where they washed them and he said he didn't know.    I was a CE troop, I had no reason to know what planes were what, or that prop was short for propeller.  This guy worked on the flight line and said he didn't know.  I got suspicious.  This was before smartphones, but after regular cell phones.  I called my buddy back home and he looked on the internet and told me what it was.  I took my GOV back to the dorms for video game time after I got the joke.

For some, every day is Memorial Day, and I think if that's the case, you should get to take the actual Memorial Day off.  Which is what I'm gonna do. After I finish the OP. Maybe not. All that gloom and boom on TV... Somebody has to remember the irreverent, funny stuff. Honestly, you'd think the military was full of marble-faced, heroic, dedicated, handsome, tragic paragons who never did anything but stand like Soviet-style ""Hero of the People"" statues.  Never met anyone who looked like he was bronzed-alive on the top of Mount Suribachi and shipped off to Washington. FNGs now... Well, that's an entirely different matter.  I'm glad to hear they still use the term ""FNG."" Our infantry FNGs were a hazard to everyone. Wasn't that they were dumb. Some of them were geniuses.   Grenades. Nobody gets to carry them on a regular basis until comes a time when you're expected to actually use them. If you look at those little packages of toy soldiers they used to sell on the back of comic books, there is always a picture of the grenade thrower, arms outstretched, ready to throw, no doubt he has the pin in his teeth.  Grenades were so romanticized in those black and white movies! Grenades just seemed like such a brutal and manly way to seal the deal! I remember as a boy throwing pinecone grenades in the woods when we played war. Very satisfying, except for the part where they don't blow up and fail utterly to obviate the inevitable argument, ""Got you! Did not, you missed! How can I miss with a grenade? It didn't go off!""...and so on.   So when you finally get to carry real grenades... my God. The weight of them feels sensual and deadly. It's almost impossible not to fiddle with them. Which is where the trouble arises.  FNGs quickly discover that those damned pins are gunna pull out your teeth, rather than the other way around. Then they worry that maybe they won't be able to pull the pin at all in some desperate emergency. Then the genius comes into play. A large percentage come up with the idea - that no one in the history of grenades has ever though of before - that if you just bend the pin inward a little, it'll be much easier to pull it. Maybe even with your teeth! Wow.  Grenade Soup Nazi inspections were a regular thing. Daily almost. Pins bent in? Ah, no grenades for YOU, Mr. FNG! Come back two years!  Maybe not that long. But when no one is calling you ""FNG"" any more."

Yeah, when I was a kid I used to play soldier just like every other 5 year old. When I joined the Air Force at 18 I still had ideas of all the 'cool toys' I'd get to use eventually. I wanted to shoot an M-16 (covered that in basic) and drive a cool military vehicle (Humvees were terribly disappointing when I got the chance. Nothing like the awesome shit GI Joe had back in the day. Ford F-150s and Gators were the norm during deployments.)  Anyway, I never got to fire an M-60 or any of the small machine guns. I never got to drive a deuce. I never got to fire a 20mm gun from a C-130.   Naturally I got older and wiser and figured out that none of those things had to do with my job. No biggie. I grew up and got over it.   The one that still gets me tho.... I really would have liked to toss a grenade at some time in my life.   Not at anyone.   Not in combat.  But pulling the pin and tossing the grenade and hunkering down and feeling the earth-shaking BOOM   Yeah, that's something I wish I had been able to do at least once in good fun.

MilitaryStories,3734eq,LeonJones,8,Sun May 24 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"The day in Basic where we played with qualified with grenades was so much fun; Thanks for reminding me of it.  At the time, it was stressful, because Basic, but, looking back, it was pretty much everything that you summed up.  We learned the different nomenclatures and uses of grenades.  We spent all day in the field, culminating in two events; the grenade assault course, and, the live fire range.  The live fire range is exactly what it sounds like; where each of us threw a live grenade.  That was pretty cool, but not as satisfying as the assault course.    The GAC was everything that a little boy's fantasy was made up of.  Our two man sections, armed with rifles (firing blanks, no less) and grenade bodies (fashioned after the M67 grenade, I believe, it's been 20 years now, with blasting caps to give a BANG and some smoke), charged an enemy encampment.  We threw grenade bodies at jeeps (real old timey jeeps, not even HMMWV's) and bunkers, and even had to lob a grenade inside one of the bunkers, in order to qualify.  Yeah, looking back, that may have been even more fun than the night infiltration course, though, at the time, I loved the NIC.    Never had a need to carry a grenade again, though.  Oh, well."

MilitaryStories,3734eq,Dittybopper,3,Tue Jun 2 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"Um, no. Not exactly. But bending the pins inward makes it easier to yank the pin out.   As I said, the impulse to fiddle with a grenade is universal and almost overwhelming. FNGs want to know exactly how much effort it takes to get that pin out of there, so why not test it? Pull the pin out, hold the spoon down, put the pin back in. Spread the cotter pins out again. This kind of fiddling around is dangerous of itself - FNGs drop things a lot.   But even if the FNG doesn't blow himself up, there are consequences from fooling around. That kind of fiddling degrades the rigidity of the pin - next time it will pull out much easier. Whatever pulls on it.  Grunts would have grenades everywhere - both web gear and rucksack straps had places you could hang them. But web gear and rucksacks get thrown around a lot, and in the woods there are lots of things - broken branches, stumps of small, woody bushes and trees, broken roots - to snag the ring on a grenade pin. Shit happens. Here's a worst-case scenario, if you're interested.  It just didn't make sense to let new guys have grenades. As I said, we mostly dropped them in tunnels and bunkers. They were thrown in combat from time to time - there were some places an M-79 just couldn't reach. But you had to know what you were doing. Bamboo was everywhere, and bamboo acted like a vertical trampoline to pitched grendades. Bounced them right back at you.  The Grenade Soup Nazi knows best. No grenade for newbie.

Enemy at the top of the hill firing down on the American GI's trying to ascend. Someone got the bright idea to throw a grenade uphill at the machine gun nest.   ...and it hit the ground in front of their nest and then rolled right back down to the guy who had thrown it. Apparently WWII grenades had a 10 second fuse. Plenty of time to come back to haunt you.
MilitaryStories,3734eq,xixoxixa,2,Fri Jun 5 04:28:22 2015 UTC,"WWII grenades had 5 second fuses, more or less. That's a long time in grenade years.   We had the same problem even with experienced grenadiers. Bamboo played havoc with tossed grenades. Somebody yelled ""GRENADE!,"" everybody hit the deck, us, the VC and NVA, civilians, passing strangers, your mamma, my mamma - everyone.  You never knew where that damned thing went."

It was the standard issue anti-personnel grenade used during World War II and in later conflicts, including the Vietnam War. Replacing the failed Mk I of 1917, it was standardized in 1920, and redesignated the Mk 2 in 1945.  The Mk.2 was replaced by the M26-series (M26/M61/M57) and later M33 series (M33/M67). It was phased out gradually in service beginning with the Korean War. Due to the tremendous quantity manufactured during World War 2, it was in limited standard issue with the US Army and US Marine Corps throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The U.S. Navy was one of the last users when it was discontinued in the 1970s.

MilitaryStories,3734eq,vcheck,14,Tue Jun 2 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"Good post /u/All_Secure. The only NUG trick I got played on me was the ""bucket of line bearing grease."" A NUG in our outfit (USASA) was a New Guy, there was no such thing as Line Bearing Grease as a line bearing is what you get when you use a direction finder to obtain a bearing on a radio transmitter. I fell for it though, and it was an old tradition on Torii Station Okinawa, and one well thought out to keep a NUG hopping from one place to another within the operations building.  My room supervisor called me up and requested I go down to the SIT shop, the DF room, and bring him a can of Line Bearing Grease. I go there, of course everyone is in on the joke. They allow as having just used the last of their bearing grease so I should go over to the maintenance shack and ask, then bring them some also. At maintenance they profess to not have any but are expecting a shipment soon and in order for my shop to get any I will have to have a lengthy form filled out, they hand me the form. Said form was a two-page mimeographed affair and I could tell that some of the questions were over my head, I trot back to the Intercept room. The room sup is ready for me when I attempt to hand him the form ""You'll have to fill it out I don't have time, if you have any questions go ask the platoon sgt (Trick Chief)."" Off I go, present myself to the Trick Chief etc. etc. He takes the form and goes red in the face...  ""Send your room supervisor in here right damned now!""   The room sup gets a mild dressing down for wasting time, I'm sent back to my position to work. Giggles are heard throughout the remainder of the shift. I'm a dumbass.   Another was BFO grease, NUGs got sent for it following the same route as I did. A Beat Frequency Oscillator is a little knob on our radio receivers, once you tune in a Morse signal you turn it one way or the other to raise or lower the pitch of the signal for optimum hearing - it doesn't have a bit of grease in it anywhere. There were other NUG jokes but I can't remember them right now.   Grenades. Trained on them in Basic, never had to throw one in anger. I did have a whole case of them at one point in VN, learned to dislike having them around, too easy to blow yourself up with. That lesson came one time while traveling in a jeep and for a lark throwing them over the top of it and watching them explode in the rice paddies, one landed on top of the paddy berm and the shrapnel shredded the jeep top - no more fun.   We also had thermite grenades which were to be used on our classified equipment should we be in danger of being overran. Well about midway in my tour I was packing  in preparation for another move and came to the damned termite's and suddenly took an interest in them ""How DO these things work really..."" You know, in case I ever had to use one, be good to know...  I took one and headed near the edge of the fire base, once there I pulled the pin intending to throw it safely away. Instead I had a John Wayne moment and simply let the handle fly before tossing it; the instant the handle flew the top of the damn thing began spewing smoke and flame and getting hotter by the split second. I panicked and tossed it high and slightly behind me, into an ammo storage trench full of small arms and 81mm mortar rounds. Fortunately it landed on and stopped on the slope and not next to any munitions. It did burn white hot and produce ungodly amounts of billowing white smoke. This did not go unnoticed and soon enough drew a crowd and a bellowing 2Lt delivering a well justified ass chewing to yours truly.   Wishing you guys a laid back Memorial Day."

Man, that's a lot cooler and more efficient than what we had. For our emergency destruction we had a fire ax and a sledge hammer.   Every once and a while we had hard drives that would need to be destroyed. We usually waited until we had a whole box. Then our COMM guy would wipe them using special software. Then they got taken to the CS and had big magnets ran all over them. Finally they'd bring them back to the CP where we'd take them out and smash them to tiny bits with the fire ax and sledge hammer.   Used to piss off the JA Captain. (His window overlooked our 'destruction area') I guess he was trying to meet with people and he'd hear us hooting and hollering and smashing shit down below. (Yeah, we got all crazy when they let us go outside to do stuff. We were usually trapped on the console all day..)   Actually... its probably good they didn't give us thermite grenades. We most certainly would have used them for nefarious deeds...."

Said devices were typically not grenades, although there were those too, but plates of thermite material with a friction igniter. At a fixed base there were twice yearly drills so everyone knew their job if it came to destroying gear and documents.  We'd all report to our assigned stations with axe, hammer or burn bags in hand and eye the damned racks of equipment with intent. There were no ""hard drives"" anywhere as they  were not in common use at the time."

Couldn't take the feeling of being a stranger in my own home anymore.    Yes. You can't go back. Everything that is right in front of you is actually behind you... WAY behind you. Not for you. Not any more...   My real home was somewhere else, somewhere far away. Somewhere far up in the mountains of Afghanistan.

It would feel strange, the people beside you would seem weird, amateur, untrustworthy.  So where should you go? Took me a loooong time to catch on to this. You're already there.

It's a fascinating book for a lot of reasons, but reading your story makes me think of one thing in particular.  Marlantes talks about how abrupt his homecoming from Vietnam was. This was partially due to technology -- the ""freedom bird"" was a lot quicker than a steam liner. But also the Vietnam replacement policy -- in which you served a year in country and then rotated out -- was tremendously destructive. You had to leave your friends behind and wonder about their fate, feeling guilty that you were home.  Marlantes wrote about the need for an odyssey: a return home, not just physically but spiritually. In WWII that happened because the men deployed as units and returned as units. They served for the duration of the war. When it was over, they had months together on a ship or in occupation duty to process the things that had happened and come to terms with their survival. And when they finally returned, they were welcomed home by a generation of men who had fought their own war and made their own homecoming."

We were there to accomplish a mission of which fighting was only a small part, and indeed if we did our jobs would become even less of a focus. We did our job and did it well, and violence dropped down to almost nothing by the end. Then it was somebody else's turn and we were gone and they took over and went about undoing all our good work, all the blood and sweat and grief that went into improving that shithole valley was undone. They did such a bad job that they were relieved after 3 months having lost 15 men and letting the conflict erupt all over again. Still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but that story holds true for the entire war. We'd have won years ago if we could just STAY until the job is done.   Coupled with that is the disparity of fighting to rear-echelon type duty. There are only 40,000 Infantrymen in the half a million strong US Army. Total. Even fewer in the Marines. So coming back the only people really understanding what you went through were others who had been in the suck, and our experience was not at all the norm.

The reason I put it in quotes is because it was vastly different than the true blood Army KP you described.   For us it was actually a sought-after job. For starters, we didn't have to wash anything by hand. We just hung out inside this little room where the other trainees would drop their trays. We'd dump whatever food was on the plate into a trash can (Breakfast we really didn't get to eat much of anything. TI's were on your ass immediately screaming ""Take a picture of your biscuit and GO!!"", lunch you got to shove food into your gullet as quickly as possible in about a 2 minute span, chug the juice, and move. Dinner the TI's tended to loom around being spooky, but generally let you eat that one meal in totality)  Anyway, we'd dump whatever food was on the plate in the trash, then separate the plates and glasses into separate plastic holders and run them through this enormous dishwasher. The machine did all the work. When they popped out the other side we stacked em up and ran em back to the kitchen.   Usually was about an hour of easy labor. Everyone else would eat while we did KP. Afterward the cooks would usually let us sit and eat after everyone else (including the TI's) had departed. It was well worth the effort just to eat a meal in peace.   We also got to raid all the ""decorational food"" items. If you were a guest visiting our DFAC you would likely be impressed by the cereal dispensers full of Fruit Loops, and the delicious looking pie that was proudly displayed in the carousel, the bags of chips stocked on the wall. ""Wow, they really feed these guys well around here"" you would think.  And you would be wrong.   Because all that shit that I just described was ""Only for decoration"" according to our TI. Touch the pie... touch the chips... even THINK about touching the breakfast cereal, and he would ""fucking kill you and blame it on the weather"".   In any event, when we pulled KP we had free reign to eat whatever we wanted and take our time doing it. Pure heaven in BMT. Almost got into a fist fight with one of my squad mates over the privilege."
MilitaryStories,359wvo,All_Secure,6,Sat May 23 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine KP as a coveted duty. I do like the idea of the mission including the directive create food ""only for decoration.""   I wonder if they have special exercises at cook school training new cooks in how to protect the ""display only"" food from hungry KPs. I wonder what uniforms the ""Aggressors"" (OpFor) wore? I mean, hungry Marines would be terrifying, no?"
MilitaryStories,359wvo,All_Secure,6,Sat May 23 17:21:07 2015 UTC,LOL. I have no idea. The 'decorational food' was simply a directive from our training instructor. We had one kid loose his mind one day and try to get a bowl of cereal for breakfast. (Dumb...dumb..dumb..)  The TI's came screaming over from the snake pit and surrounded him. He evaporated into a puddle of sobs as the TI hats enveloped him. Poor bastard never even got milk into the bowl....  Although it would be funny to see some Ninja cooks out defending a plate of cookies from a squad of Marines. I'm sure the cook's obituary would be heartfelt...

I had been in the woods so long I could tell 1967 Turkey Loaf C-rations from 1968 - 1967 was better. We were headed back to the battery and starving. Begged some food off a Battery Mess Sergeant along the way. We asked him for C-rations because we couldn't imagine anything else, and he told us he was fresh out. Aw.  He dog-eyed us a little, then said ""Wait a minute."" He came back with coffee, sugar, milk, Wonder Bread, ham, yellow mustard and processed cheese, and commenced to fix us sandwiches. Ambrosia! My God, 47 years later and my mouth is still watering. Bliss!  Here's the rest of the story. Mess Sergeants can have my dry socks just for asking.  As for your civilian-contractors, I believe you reinforce the point I was making in the OP. One set of guys have a contract and a salary. KPs had a uniform and a mission. Makes all the difference, no? Thanks for your service right back atchya. From the bottom of my heart palate.   Since there aren't so many war stories about food, I got another one. Cuisine, a cautionary tale about peppers and Marines."

This one, though, at least to me seems un-revised and un-polished.  Just a thought about a recollection.  That's how I take it anyways.  You know what?  As soon as I saw KP I thought ""fuckin' pots&pans.""  As hot and humid and claustrophic and noisy as p&p was, I liked it for the same reasons.  We just scrubbed stuff and tried to keep up and mostly got left alone.  The icing on the cake, for us at least, was literally cake.  I can barely remember the trays of food and platters of sweets that us trainees weren't allowed to touch, and how we'd wolf down whatever looked good before it went into the trash, hands wrinkled and dripping clawing bits of extra chow to stuff into our faces without being caught.    I also remember later, in Iraq before the contractors took everything over, the pride that our cooks had when our mess tent finally went up for the battalion.  It may not have been great, but they worked their asses off to give us the best that they could with what they had, and we were grateful.  I mean, we still bitched about it because The Army, but we were still grateful and they did their best.  Funny that I finally read this today.  I was thinking earlier, at work, about why the civilian world pisses me off sometimes.  Soldiers, with the exception of the shitbags, seem to care more.  There seems to be a larger sense of community.  There seems to be less of the ""not my job"" attitude.  Maybe I'm looking through rose colored glasses.  Maybe not.  I remember smoking with the Cooks in our Battalion AO, in garrison, and finding out what their schedules were.  We had nothing but respect because their job just seemed tough.

The thing that always drove me nuts in my last unit, was all the new soldiers we would get always had the same mentality. ""We are just commo! We don't do shit!"", or ""We ain't support the fight! We do a lame job! I should of went Blah blah or blah blah"". Drove me nuts. I'd get new guys, try and train them, and always run into the same thing. ""This isn't what I thought it would be!"", ""We ain't doing nothing important! If it goes down, who cares! If it breaks, who cares!"". And at some point I'd always have to take them to the dunes, (Fort bliss.. no wood line. :( ) and break it down for them. They would always think when they first met me I was nuts, and too hooah, and too serious. Well, once we went to the dunes, spoke some words, they would get the picture.  ¬†  We might be doing something that seems to make no difference, and might not seem important, but if that network goes down, that radio goes down, then guess what. Them guys getting shot at? Them guys who have a man down, and need to call in a bird? Them guys who might just have a blown tire and need a tow, and guess how they are going to contact someone to do that? Radio, email, chat, some form of communication that goes through our systems, and if they are down, they may just die.   ¬†  I might not be in the front lines fighting, but would I drop everything to do it if asked? Damn right I would. But I got a skill set, and a job that still is important and will still save lives and get the mission complete, and I'm going to do my best. I thank you for all you did, but I especially appreciate that you notice that us in the back are doing something to. That we are doing our best to help you and help you complete your mission. Seems modern day Army, that gets lost on the young soldiers. They forget we got an important job. They don't see the difference it makes.   ¬†  Sorry, i rambled quite a bit there. This post, out of a lot that I have read, really struck a cord, in a good way. Enough to make me comment for once, haha. Also, where I was KP was hell. We went to the field constantly, and for months at a time, and we had to do KP out there. I got lucky. I was ""mission essential personal"", so didn't have to do KP due to my job was deemed to important for them to be running around the desert to find me. Though, when I first got to that unit, and went to that first field exercise, I sure did my share of KP and it sucked. 110 degrees outside, and inside that tent with no AC and hot steamy water... it felt like hell. Especially when good ol' CSM got a stick in his ass, and demanded everyone to be in full gear no matter what or who they were or what they were doing. (That only lasted two days though... If i remember right, I think we had 30 some people fall out due to the heat, and have to be sent to medics or some to the rear). Anyway, i'm still rambling. Loved the post! Thank you for your service, and thank you for realizing we guys in the rear may not be right next to you fighting the fight, but we are in the rear fighting the fight in our own way, and making sure your all good to go!"

Thank you. No comment needed. Speaks for itself.  As for commo... I was an artillery Forward Observer. When other guys were reaching for their rifles, I was reaching for my PRC-25. My weapon was my radio. The rest of my weapon depended on at least one other radio, and a battery tied together by wiremen.   We were out in the middle of nowhere alone because the Army trusted the skills of the Signal Corps not to leave us voiceless and stranded and under attack. The Army was mighty confident in those wiring skills. We were pretty far out there.  I know it's different inside the berm. I know most of military work seems nothing like the movies. If it helps, Heaven has no gratitude like a boonie-rat FO with new boots and dry socks and a radio that works and a clear field of fire. Gratitude enough to carry 47 years down the timeline.

Seems the Army just forgot about them.  They slogged their way to the nearest fire base out of food and around O'dark thirty.  Enlisted mens' mess was closed.  Obviously nasty grunts straight out of the jungle couldn't eat in in officers' mess.  This really pissed off their Kit Carson scout.  His GI's were hungry.  He had to act.  I don't know what kitchen he snuck into.  He reappeared a few minutes later with enough canned goods to, well, feed an army.    When dad was a kid, he always hated canned asparagus.  He was forced to eat it every dinner (as was I later on).  None of the cans the Kit Carson scout were marked so it was pretty much luck of the draw.    Dad wielded his P38 against the enemy can and bested it with style and panache.  Canned asparagus.  He ate it like it was the best steak ever served.  I still hate the crap, but I never been starving, either.  break  I do a lot of menial jobs at work.  I've discovered that it provides a certain amount of freedom.  A couple of managers almost never give me direction as long as they see me busy.  I know what needs to get done, and I do it.  Seems like a no brainer.  ""moving0target is busting his ass.

Ain't never been hungry enough to make asparagus taste good. That's just unnatural.  I'm sorry the Officers' Mess was so dickish. I'm guessing that particular mess hall was under the aegis of some Supply WO-4 who imagined himself a Maitre d'. Now a real Mess Sergeant... well!  Back in 1969 we were picked up in the woods late evening and flown back to Phuc Vinh or Phuc Binh or something like that - anyway a large base that imagined it was due for a major attack. Our grunts were designated as the ""reaction force.""  They dumped us in a field right out in the open just behind the wire, designated a piss-tube and a ammo-box squat over half of a 55 gallon drum and told us to sit tight - sleep in your boots, keep your gear on.   We really didn't mind. We could make our own overhead cover, didn't have to deploy trip flares and claymores, no ambushes, could talk as loud as we wanted and smoke all night. Most guys just zee'ed out stretched out on the ground. As it got darker, people started breaking out heat-tabs and stove-cans, C-rations and LRRPs.  Then a convoy of 3/4 ton trucks approached with those little slit lights on. An E-7 emerged and saluted our captain. Dinner for the reaction force, compliments of Colonel No-idea-who-he-was. The trucks debarked a squad of mess people who proceeded to set up a chow line.   Turns out that the Mess Sergeant ran the - so help me - Senior Officers' Mess. He had seen us sitting in the field and asked if anyone planned to feed us. Why no. Those guys were boonie rats. They had their own food and water. Which was true.  The SO Mess Sergeant contacted his Colonel and asked if the senior officers could dine with the junior officers for one night. The Colonel allowed as to how the brass might be able to rough it for one night.  Excellent meal. Real coffee. Real milk. Real food. We all dined in the dark, scraped our nice plates into the designated trash bin. My only reservation was that the mess personnel had no light discipline. Every time they lit up the chow line with flashlights, we all ducked. Been in the woods too long.  Many thanks were given. The SO Mess Sergeant apologized that they would not be able to come back at breakfast. No one cared. We were well-fed, fat and sassy, inside the wire for once and it looked like it wasn't going to rain. Can't do better'n that. Gonna be an attack? We're ready to go.   As for the Mess Sergeant? I dunno. I like to picture the first brass-hat who complained that his steak was overdone. A SO Mess Sergeant would never say anything impertinent to an officer, but the look the complainer would get - a look that would wither oak leaves. Imagine."

I believe that general just decided I was just too tiny a target for his giant general boots to stomp. He'd have to get a bunch of lower-ranking people involved and explain to all of them just why whatever insubordinate thing I was doing - something like telling him eggs come from chickens, or to take his shiny stars off my sniper-haunted LZ - was an insult to his dignity.

When ""Chickenhawk"" was published 1983 I was about a year away from earning my striped bathrobe and happy-face slippers outfit from the Psych Ward at the VA. I was pretty bunkered up. Didn't read Vietnam stuff, didn't watch the movies, didn't follow the news. That stuff didn't matter any more. It was over - it had to be over - I couldn't think about it because I had so many other very important things that I had to consider important because we all agreed they were very important - career, family, debt, yuppieness. Vietnam wasn't important, and I needed to stop feeling like it was, and I was pretty sure I had stopped until one morning I tried to eat a loaded gun.  So I missed that book. And all the books. I still don't read about it. I dunno. Makes me mad. I expect the things I write make other Vietnam vets mad. Doesn't make any sense, but there it is. It was a madding crowd of a war.

I don't remember if I've told about his funeral. He started smoking when he was 11. Many years later, (when I was a kid and he was retired, he got pneumonia and couldn't smoke. 20 years later, lung cancer got him anyway. Kinda ironic considering his career.   He had a funeral with full military honors. All was well as we sat in an open pavilion at the cemetery. His minister said a few of the typical things you'd expect to hear. Then a parade of folks got up to talk about how he'd touched their lives in some ways.   Taps was played (on a boom box...Army budget cuts I guess), 21 gun salute was fired  (you only get to keep three of the casings. The rest have to be accounted for...Army budget cuts I guess), and the folded flag was presented to grandma.   After everything was said and done, Uncle  (the eldest son) led the blood male relatives to grandpa's final repose , and we read the stone saying in part, ""An old soldier gone home to rest. WWII, Korea, Vietnam."" We stood around the open grave  (politely telling the cemetery employees where they could shove their backhoe when they tried to chase us off) and had a good, manly cry.  Afterward, Uncle declared ""ties off"" and off to a big dinner we went.   The draftee side of the family?   We're scattered around the world. Someone dies, and they're generally cremated. A few months later, when we can all get together, we have a huge party with expensive booze and insanely expensive food.   Guess it's just different family tradition."

He said the scuttlebutt was what I said earlier - all Vietnamese hated the ROKs. But their AO was peaceful.

MilitaryStories,32dqq8,bloodchit,7,Wed Apr 15 09:16:22 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, Jorge Semprun's 'Literature or Life' was also written fifty years onward of his two-year Buchenwald internment (but from the prisoners' side).   Here's an outstanding interview with him about purging personal trauma through writing (which he, like Primo Levi, believed that 'filtered truth' was the only way to make historical trauma palatable/scalable to the masses). I think its intuitive -- in the aftermath of man-made trauma, grief demands silence and honor first (ok, well, with the famous exception of Picasso's Guernica, which was mind-bogglingly created a couple months after the 1937 event).  Here's Semprun's take on writing as a living witness:   Literature has played a dual and contradictory role in my life. The act of writing appeases one‚Äôs memories and eases the act of forgetting. When I write, I make my memories tangible, and in this way I can get rid of them. On the other hand, writing is but a ploy to convulse memory back into life. And the more I write, the more my memories return to inhabit me.   I love this sub and its contributors for way too many reasons to explain, but most compelling is my need for testimony and truth in the aftermath of 20th/21st century man-made traumas.   Loss and trauma is deeply personal, but putting it into an expressive language (film, fiction, poetry, art, etc.) makes it universal and collective, sets a baseline for survivors, and ensures an enduring legacy. The stories here are full of heroism, pride, tragedy and humor, but there's never boast or brag. Just another day's duty. I find that exemplary."
MilitaryStories,32dqq8,Dittybopper,5,Wed Apr 15 09:56:15 2015 UTC,"That's spot on. I dunno. It's not about putting things down on paper so you can forget them in your head. It's more about wrangling memories - round 'em up, put 'em in a pen, count 'em, brand 'em, sort 'em out. Better than letting them run all free-range around your head, pouncing on you from nearby bushes.   After two years of reddit, those memories - the war memories - are better behaved. Oh, you again. Yes, I still remember you. What are you doing out here? You belong in this pen here. I'm gonna put you there, and I'll tend to you when I have another cup of coffee under my ever-expanding belt. Memory seems less rowdy, more civilized and polite than it used to be.   but there's never boast or brag.   ""What never? No, never! What never? Well... hardly ever!""

MilitaryStories,32dqq8,bloodchit,6,Wed Apr 15 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"Well I think he is you u/AM... I remember that story and your ""perfect"" vietnamese. gotcha.  I began writing my war memories around 1993 or 4, like you said they were always sniping at me from the bushes, intruding, being assholes and very interruptive. They were also very disorganized, a rabble of random thoughts, scenes and deja vu flashbacks. For years after my one-year tour I attempted to ""get over it,"" live a ""normal"" life - was not happening, something had to lance the boil. Writing about it did just that, it felt good to put it down, to purge it. I thought the act of doing that was the end of it, at first anyways.   Not so, one memory purged lead to another hopping around with its hand raised ""Me me me, hey, remember me! I would and dutifully make the effort to put the next one in context and put it down to paper. Something happens automatically when you do that, you begin to make sense of your experiences, a kind of sense anyway, not factual sense, more an emotional sense, a sense you can use. It is like you reached inside and lifted the little dears (those jumbled senseless scenes and walking nightmares) up into the light and stroked them, calmed them, extracted a kernel of insight then laid them out and covered them. On to the next...  It builds and feeds upon itself though, the more you scribble, nothing ever becomes tidy, settled, truly known. In the end, and after 20 years of this I am (likely) at the end of my need to write, I'm not really any closer to closure than when I began. But I am, I am closer, but to what I don't really understand. I do feel better about it all, the writing has been cathartic in many ways. Actual healing has occurred.  I do encourage the process to anyone feeling that need to write."

MilitaryStories,321r54,Dittybopper,13,Fri Apr 10 16:22:35 2015 UTC,Dogs man.  That hit me right in the gut.  Every single deployment I have been on there have been those mangy flea ridden dogs.  They make the worst places in the world bearable.  I bet the wild dog adoption is such a universal thing that if you were to find Caesars Commentaries early drafts there was probably a chapter on how to find and keep wild dogs.
MilitaryStories,321r54,Dittybopper,13,Fri Apr 10 00:49:18 2015 UTC,"Happiest dogs I ever met were dogs that had a job and knew how to do it. Sheep dogs are in freakin' heaven. Pet dogs are mostly unhappy. They deal with unpredictable human family dynamics where they always seem to be underfoot and peripheral. If there is a clear, doggy-doable task - hunt, scout, guard, herd, attack - then they can locate themselves and their status in the monkey pack. They have a base for social interaction.  And there are so many things they can do for us and our packs. We are all nose-blind, deaf monkey boys and girls to them - we have gaps that they can fill and draw status from.   Once they have some defined status that makes dog-sense to them, they blossom. I think that's why they like humans so much. Even the lowest pack outcast, defeated loner can find something important to do for humans. We are pathetic, and we need someone to smell and hear for us, because we travel in packs too.   We do. We just forget. The military is nothing but various packs. Dogs can't help but see it. We puzzle them when we forget. But we don't really ever forget. The people you fought with are still and always your people. All of them. Dogs too.  We think we should forget, move on, let it go. The pack never lets go. Who we are, what we are, is defined by our status and function in our pack. Dogs know that. We do too, but we talk ourselves out of it. Bullshit. The pack never lets go."

MilitaryStories,321r54,Dittybopper,9,Fri Apr 10 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, there you are. Thought you might've grabbed a flintlock and gone to ground. That plan keeps sounding better and better as time rolls by.  I know for a fact that the military doesn't understand troop dynamics. For one thing, Spec5s are always alphas. And the El Tee hardly ever is.  But you know the social anthropologists just get it all wrong too. They act like the Social Alpha male is the god-king or something. A functioning pack has a whole series of other alphas.   I think all those scientists are sex-crazed - they stay focused on who gets to mate most. Anyone who had been a part of a pack knows that ain't even most of what's going on. Hell, in human packs, females are noticeably absent, yet pack behavior continues. No wonder the dumb scientists can't make head nor tail of bonobos - they keep writing them off as some kind of chimpanzee hippie communalists. Pfaw. We should bring back the draft just for anthropologists. Dumbasses.  Glad you enjoyed the OP. It was a fun write."
MilitaryStories,321r54,Dittybopper,7,Fri Apr 10 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"One question: Did you understand all the dynamics while in-country or figure it out after, let it seep in over time?

Seems to me you've been cognating on it for quite a while.  I (we) worked with the 9th ID too, down in the delta when I first arrived, spent like a month with them and the ARVN."
MilitaryStories,321r54,snimrass,8,Fri Apr 10 19:47:17 2015 UTC,"Huh. Good question. I dunno.  I had worked with dogs before I got to the cav troop, but they were K-9 Corps - either scout dogs or guard dogs. They were trained not to bond with anyone but their controller. They would work with us - walk point or something - but they never actually joined our unit.  I think I was well aware that Army rank and the actual rank in a military unit didn't always match. Usually the Social Alpha was the First Sergeant. Sometimes the Commanding Officer was in charge, but mostly what I saw was captains giving orders to the Top, and the top giving orders the the platoon sergeants, and then there was a meeting where they informed the lieutenants what was going on. I was always a quasi-outsider - the artillery guy - so I had a lot of time to watch.  The cav troop I was with had been stripped of senior NCOs by jungle ague. We had one other LT. Wolf and Rhett were both E-5s. So there was social niche for Princess, I guess. She was very proprietary about the troop.  I was in her track, and god knows we weren't busy all the time, so I watched her. She wasn't playful or friendly - the most she'd do is sit down beside you. When she finally greeted me, I swear I could hear what she was saying. Very smart dog.  So I watched her. So did a lot of people. She was very attentive to our moods. She'd go lie down beside (but not touching) people who were hurting or feeling bad. I saw that.  Other than that, she would alert us when she detected something - not the kind of alert that military dogs are trained to do. She'd just stop, then turn her head to look for Rhett. Everyone respected her nose and ears. Nobody blew her off.  But yeah, I had no training in anthropology. It's hard to separate what I remember from what I learned in the meantime. I can, I think, see what she was doing back then both from the time I was with her and from 47 years down the timeline. I mixed 'em together some, because I wanted to give her the best story I could, as best I could understand the story she made.  She was a friend. I was writing like she was looking over my shoulder. I expect she'd give me a few dope-snips for overwriting. I hope she'd like it.    Seems to me you've been cognating on it for quite a while.   I wrote this one out for reddit about two years ago. Got a ton of gold and karma. People seemed to think it was a sad, sad story about a nice doggy who died. I wanted to do it right this time. This story doesn't make me sad. She did really well. Proud to have known her.  The peripheral mystery of this whole saga is what the hell was the 9th ID's cavalry scout battalion doing 500 miles north of the Division? How did that come to be? I'd love to hear that story from any perspective."

Apparently they were all over the place in I Corps.  I was with them from mid-July to early September 1968. The only map relevant to our operations is called Hai Lang. At the city (?) of Hai Lang on Highway 1, a road cuts NE (looks like ""602""). That was the road to Utah Beach, aka Wunder Beach - I had forgotten that name. You can't see our Battalion HQ, because it's off the map on the South China Sea. Doesn't matter. I never saw Utah Beach either. Closest I came was when we camped outside the wire, while the CO visited his M48s.   We did thunder runs up and down that road 602, from the South China Sea to Highway 1. Our primary AO at the time was dune country northwest of that road.   They don't seem to have that map. But that striped road cutting across 602, called 555 near as I can see, is a northern extension of the Rue sans Joie that goes all the way down to Hue. Actually that whole village/rice paddy built up area south of the dunes is the Rue. It was a neighborhood more than an actual street.  Anyway, we patrolled an area more or less like that to the NW, just off the map. Weird to see the old maps. I remember running fast on the west side of the dunes, popping WP rounds 600 meters up on a four-digit grid just to get a flash-to-bang estimate of our position.   See those green patches along the coast? A kind of feathery conifer forest grew on 100 meter high dunes just off the shore. Those were fishing villages up in the pines. Freakin' gorgeous, shady, constant sea breeze to break the heat. That's where the NVA were dropping off their wounded and maintaining a medical cadre to treat them. Like recuperating in Bali Hai - friendly village girls, nice weather. We spent some time looking for a ""hospital"" there. More about that in the ""Wolf"" link in the OP.  Thanks for the flashback. 3rd of the 5th. Good to know. I was in the 4th of the 7th cav down where you were. Gotta get me a cowboy hat.  Thanks, man.

They sent us charging all over the place inside and outside of our AO - cover a flank here, be a blocking force there, screen this territory while the guys who own it go somewhere else. This was the only cavalry outfit I was in (and I was in lots of them) that actually functioned like cavalry from the old days. We did a lot of hard driving, even a charge or two.   Nobody owned us, inspected us, harassed us.

I was a specialists alpha male - you know hunter, scout, digger - and I have that authority.   Specialist alphas are pack members who take charge under certain circumstances. It's not just a dog thing - I remember times when a whole platoon was willingly taking orders from a natural-born point man. I don't think Princess understood my speciality, but she gave me that rank anyway.  The social alpha males in that pack were Wolf and Rhett. She'd look for one of them when she detected discord in the pack. She settled for me one time.  She was camping out by one of the tracks. We found out later that one of the guys in that track had just received a ""Dear John"" letter.  She couldn't see Wolf or Rhett. If dogs can do an exasperated look, she gave me one as I stood around like nothing was wrong. I can hear her in my head. Can't you SMELL that? Do you even scent? The males in this box are unhappy/angry/sad/disturbed. What the hell is the MATTER with you monkey alphas? Go get Rhett!  I went and got Wolf.

There are thousands of vets dealing with the same story or a similar story who are trying to live their lives among people who don't have any means of getting a clue about what they've seen and done. People they love. People who love them. People who seem convinced that ""all of that stuff"" is over and done with.  Someone will be out there tonight reading while the family sleeps. Someone who was alone with a memory that is utterly alien to his current life - incomprehensible, inconceivable, impossible - yet a memory that will not fade. If anything, it is becoming more clear and insistent.  You've lit a candle in the dark, OP. You don't have to solve it. You can, if you're strong enough, share it - let those vets know that there in the dark while loved ones sleep, they are not alone. Not crazy. That happened. Others out there understand.

The old regulars 'round here (Anathema and Ditty to name the most prolific and historical two who have the remembered) are something that I can soak in and understand, and while I can commiserate, I can also cut them out from my give-a-fuck and be distant.   /u/ColdSteelRain had the saddest story about about the PL Red-Six.  Ouch.  Maybe being removed from it helps to laugh instead of identify.  I tried hard to fail identifying with our submitters who were balls deep in South-east Asia.    I learned, at a point, to call it all nothing worth a shit, but it caught up with me on a day that I didn't expect.  Go figure that those fucking cunts could be humans, and I might feel something for them, right?  As far as the pieces you policed, fuck that and I wouldn't ever want too have to do that.  I've been on a BDA, but it only rewarded us with un-recognizable shit, without bodies or pieces, and I can't sa I'm disappointed.     One of the funniest stories was from one of my Boy's in '03 in Iraq.  They shot the dude a lot, and then buried him on the side of the road, and then had to un-bury him, and they put him in the back of an LMTV with garbage, and had to turn his body in to the people that dealt with that sort of thing.    Some of the moments that I remember, with the fondness of what I'd imagine parents feel for their child, are at the same time the most violent and the most compassionate.   How does that make sense?

One of the first things that occur when we find ourselves in a war is the shutting down of ""normal"" feelings, we develop a psychological shell, a hardness, that aids us in dealing with all the weird and that becomes your new normal. Happened to me, and it happened to you and your buddies. Yeah, it is kinda fucked up but that is just how we humans cope.

But when you're in a stressful situation, like picking up after a suicide bomber, you tend to cling to any plan that makes sense. For some reason, fingerprints made sense to us.   I reckon we all know that feeling. And any decision or course of action is better than no decision at all.  Kids though, kids are always what get me. Doing boat people stuff, I never wanted to hold the babies. I let my offsider do that, while I searched the mothers. Don't know why I was so opposed to it, guess it's a way of staying disconnected.

He was a bean-pole of a white boy.  His wife was a, ahem larger african-american female, who was a little bit demanding.  Oh, Billy.  Poor sunnuvabitch.  The few ""family"" events we had were basically all of the single soldiers getting shithoused and avoiding all others.  These were events that were held off post, though.  We'd just get fucked up out of ice chests in POV trunks, and usually married bastards would join us if they could escape.  Billy and Josh were at Lewis at the same time, same unit, and independently ended up in the same Platoon at the same time.  The world of the Combat Engineer is small.  I've met one former 1st LT who knew my last PL in a completely different State, of the cuff.  Anyways...Billy was still at Lewis, and for whatever reason was getting married to this huge black 'lady'.  The best part was that Josh was there, and told us all about how her dad tried to talk Bill out of marrying his daughter before the wedding, because he felt bad for him.  He tried to talk him out of it before he walked his daughter to the altar.  She was mean, and a yeller and beat-a-man-downer.  We all just collectively ignored her while she was around.  Obviously he couldn't, though.  He was just so beat down.  The army destroyed my faith in the institution of marriage.    Sgt Softie reminds me of Billy."

I remember at Reception, we were sitting down outside, after shots, and having an orientation class.  I swear, Right IN FRONT of me, a bird dropped a load on the dude in front of me.  purple with a white streak dripping down his back.  OMG, he didn't even feel it.

I can imagine the stress they must deal with watching the ""ate up"" new recruits trying to get in formation.  I bet it was to get them good and riled up before a cycle so they can be ""committed"" to the job.  Like letting a Pit Bull look at a tire for a few days before you turn him loose on it... er, I mean let him play with it.  I wonder.  You could send a Reserve Drill Sergeant there first so he'd be good and HOT by the time he got to his cycle.  oh those poor <bleepards> when he gets his paws on them.  ROTF.

MilitaryStories,30eu13,Reconsct,4,Fri Mar 27 02:13:39 2015 UTC,5 minutes? I think ours was something closer to an hour and a half. All while getting our TA-50s. I remember having to hold my TA-50 bag (found out later it was simply our laundry bag) straight out while the drills were calling out equipment. After each call we had to put it in the bag and go back to holding arms out straight. That's the most Drill Sergeants I've ever seen in one place in my life. A sea of round brown.

Of course you Grunts would be bitchin' about RCP.  I was talking to an E-6 outside of the transient tents in Sharana once. He said, ""No offense, but I fucking hate following you guys.""  I told him that if he was ever following us we would be happy to pull over and let him pass, and that we even had a wrecker for when he found the first IED.  No offense, but I never understood why you guys were in such a hurry to get blown up.  We offered to go out of our way to clear route for some of our Infantry who were rolling in up-armored's, and they said ""No.""  They made it home okay, thankfully, but WTF?  We never stopped because it was dark, was there a particular reason for that?  Also, your RCP guys sound like a bunch of fucking assholes if they were raiding a COP for supplies.  We always made a point of raiding the FOB chow hall for goodies to bring when we were going to COP's, especially if we had a trailer.  We tried to live out of our Vic's if we were at a tiny place.  Just good manners.  Anyway, good story.  Fuck broken metatarsals!"
MilitaryStories,30d0m2,SoThereIwas-NoShit,3,Fri Mar 27 01:48:28 2015 UTC,"The reason we'd get pissed off is because we clear our own routes all the time, and know where the danger spots are. So we'd check those and be able to generally floor it everywhere else and make it to a place in 1/4 the time. Yeah, RCP was assholes for us. It was made up of all the support pukes, cooks etc. from our support company. They were just super dicked up. They were good to have in some areas like the valley we got fucked up in, but on routes like Iowa they were generally worthless.  Also I have NO IDEA why they wanted to stop after dark, RCP at least can keep clearing with the Husky/Buffalo combo. I think it was to spite me, because that seemed to be how everything else worked out on this mission."

The ones I've known do not act like that normally.  Tough to describe, but ... like they only bring out the fire when they have to.  Zen or something maybe.  One sort of tone where you could question him. And the other... the command voice... was used only to save your life or keep you from getting hurt.  kinda weird but kinda kewl.

Of course, the gift shop being open, their entire stock of nicotine was gone in minutes by the time we were done with it. I smoked half a pack in the hour and a half it took the bus to arrive. That was a mistake I'd find out later on. A 2 hour ride to Lawton arriving at the 95th AG where we'd be spending the next week being drilled, inoculated and uniformed.

Everything in the Play is true.  All of the little bullshit minutae, and goddamn I'd forgot so much.  All of the events and retarded little moments and the characters, the only words that are fake or made-up are the fact that maybe it wasn't one night, but an amalgamation of more than one.

MilitaryStories,305iv1,technak,68,Tue Mar 24 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"Formatted for paragraphs and spelling.  Totally wish i new this sub existed sooner cause boy do i have stories. A super quick background i was a navy fmf corpsman. At the time of this i was either e2 or e3. I was deployed for operation unified protector. After libya we went on to go do international coalition type exercises. One of them ended up being in spain. Mind you this was mid august, everything about this fiblx sucked. Our tents had to be set up in a cow field. I shit you not. Pun intended. It was everywhere.   Anyways. This was a balls out field op. Eeeeverything was deploying on land and then being reboarded. LCAC and i belive LCUs. Lcac are those bad ass hovercraft that are massive and look like they have a huge ballon underneath them and huge fans on the back to move them around. Real bad ass. But cant carry as much of a load as the LCUs. Those are thr pontoon looking boats that get real close to the beach and drop their front gate. They can carry a a massive payload of personal and tanks and what not.   So now that we have a background. here i am early morning with my shock trauma platoon layed out on the gorgeous spanish beach awaiting extraction. Straight ahead you see an LCU start lining up with the beach head and a tank slowly rolling up in reverse. So its butt was facing the front of the LCU. As the LCU pulled up it lowered its front bridge into the water and a sailor walked out and meassured the depth. Im pretty sure he relayed something along the lines of this isnt fucking right lol. So here we are on the beach. The tank crew decides to run in with their rifles above their heads and get on the LCU. Only the driver of the tank was in it. So i shit you not. These guys go sprint into the water. Tall guys, i knew them. And poof they all disappear beneath the water. Cant make this stuff up. So they actually have to wade back to the beach. If that doesnt tell you hey maybe we're a little to far out then you're probably an idiot like the O3 that told them to drive the tank in anyway.   So the tank grumbles to life and he proceeds to slam it into reverse and head into the water. Going going bam. Fucking black smoke billowing out of its ass underwater coming up. No longer moving. Only the turret is above the water at an awkward beach slant facing the rest of us. At first im confused as we all are. We're laughing even. Apparently the LCU landed on one of those sand bars and right after its bridge was a straight drop off. The tank whilst in reverse nailed the back of that sandwall so hard that apparently its back exhaust ruptured somewhere and started flooding the tank.   All the electronic systems failed. Now you start seeing the tank crew frantically jumping in the water. The driver was stuck inside. Drowning. It clicked. We bugged out and got ready for anything. The driver said that the hatch got undone literally on his last second above and last breath. They pulled him. All is well. Dead tank in water.   So now that the serious part is over. Here is all the funny shit that happened because of it. My cmdr, asked the guys of that crew to hold his equipment on top of it during extraction back to ship. After all what safer placer to haul some gear then the top of a tank hahaha. His shit sank in the ocran along with a bunch of sleeping bags and tents we watched wade off into the ocean. The O3 that told the tank to go. Is literally sweating fucking bullets. When i tell you i watched him smoke a new cigarette every two minutes im not kidding you. Cherry was almost as big as tje cigarette itself.   And then it happens. And osprey comes flying over out heads not giving a fuuu... and lays smack dab on the beach. Out comes walking the O6 colonol and e9 sgt major and clamly walk down to the beach amd up to this O3 beachmaster. Sorry just remembered his tittle. Im pretty sure it was something along the lines of be ready to feel the wrath of the green and blue weenie seaman beachmaster. His face was pale white afterwards.   Tide later came in and all that was left of it was the tip. It took a bulldozer, a 7 ton, and a wrecker to pull out the 70 tons plus water. Shitty part was that LCU was also our ride so we got stuck having to sprint down beach a mile away in full gear and equipment at the end and had about ten minutes to catcg an LCAC that was about to leave and didn't know we were coming. Most hardcore run of my entire life. The end. Sorry, didn't think it would be this long."

The LCU is not a pontoon vessel. The one you are probably thinking of is the HSV/TSV. It's nothing big or important, I just wanted to clarify the vessels you were referring to.  What I am curious about is where was the crew? What was the bridge team doing that they didn't know about a sandbar?"

MilitaryStories,304rld,iaalaughlin,3,Wed Mar 25 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"WOW.  a couple hundred tons!!!!  drool!!!!!  maybe we should start making their Ammonium Nitrate.  Most plants in the US put an inhibitor to slow the burn to a fizz.  The ICI plant in Calgary doesn't, they make it for the ICI explosives division.  I got to go there.  Interesting.  They pump the mixture to the top of a HUGE silo and squirt it out of shower heads with little rotating blades on them.  By the time it gets to the bottom it's dry pellets and can carried by belt to the storage area.  insurgents!!! that pisses me off.    whack tards, butt holes, nut cases... most of em not even from Afghanistan I bet.

But, I know for a fact that is the reason why the Bagram demo range is so green.  You could see the difference between when we arrived and when we left.    Although, we also had to dispose of powdered aluminium so there might be some long term health effects to crops planted in that area in the future...  I will tell you though, there is not really much of a point for the inhibitor - if you know what you are doing.    I've seen the creation of the prills also.  It is pretty interesting, especially when you consider that you will get a much better bang out of it with a bit of work.  Same thing with Tannerite.

I'm young again today. This is the kind of story I heard as I grew up in a military family. WWII was the real war. It is a freakin' honor for us to host your great grandpa's story.  I have heard about guys who knew they weren't going to make it. Seems eerie. I've seen a lot of things in my war, but never that.  Anyone else? I know a lot of guys who wrote a ""dead-hand"" letter and left it with a friend. Never anyone who collected on it. Can't imagine.

There's a whole plot device in Red Badge of Courage about one of the young man's companions who talked a brave show delivering up his death letters just before a battle he survived. And what an embarrassing, rueful ordeal it was for him to ask for them back.  I'm guessing this sort of premonition and last testament - verbal or written - occurs all the time when military men have the time to make them, i.e. waiting off the coast of Saipan, the night before the Battle of Chancellorsville, the morning before flying off to Ploesti.   Seems a natural, supernatural thing - those who have too much time on their hands will stare into the darkness, and many of them will feel the darkness staring back. Of necessity, given the nature of war, some of them will be right.  I think my war experience is more the exception than the rule. We were sort of in play all the time, a constant anticipation of combat at any given moment. I can't remember many long, safe hours to ponder my fate.

MilitaryStories,2zy14z,Dittybopper,5,Sun Mar 22 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"Agree. I worked for an airline then, was driving into work when I heard a radio report of the first plane hitting. I got to work and everyone was crowded into the break room watching TV. I already knew there was no chance in hell that that 737 could have accidentally crashed into a world Trade tower, but I couldn't account for the why of it, then we watched as the second plane hit.   Screams, gasps, total shock in that room and I realized with a jolt ""We're going to war!"". It got very quiet, everyone knew there were flight crews on those aircraft, there is a brotherhood among airline workers. When a plane goes down all the other airline companies send condolences, make donations, provide good and services to the affected airline and show solidarity.   Later that morning word was passed that every civilian aircraft in the country was grounded so we went into emergency mode getting what few planes we could back to home base, dealing the massive passenger mess and locking down our buildings. I was asked by my manager to form a guard detail (unarmed) and to secure the building we were in. I went around asking for ex military personnel, gathered a few and found a few others whom I thought I could trust. We got some radios from operations and locked things down and made arrangements for two hour shifts. Spent the rest of the day on that duty, at five o'clock we all went home except for those still working to sort out the PAX mess plus we had two aircraft at JFK and several other cities, stuck until they could fly again.  It was when walking out into the parking lot when I heard it, the silence. No planes or con trails in the sky, none on the runways, none to be heard. Dead silence in a place I where was so used to the constant sound of jet engines, the September sky a deep blue, the perfect fall day with the sun heading toward the horizon. I drove over the the passenger terminals, empty except for the police, I was stopped, questioned, then asked to leave. I drove the 45 minutes into town, went to have a beer at a local place. Okay, I had more than one... It had been a surreal day."

He was in this village in northern Mexico looking for people who had met Pancho Villa, and he kept getting to referred to this very old man who lived on the edge of town. After some difficulty, he finally located the gentleman living in a semi-nice adobe, well tended.  After the amenities, the researcher asked the old man if he had ever met Pancho Villa.  ‚ÄúDid I meet Pancho Villa? I knew of him. He was very famous. I was younger and poorer back in 1922. I was using my only mule to gather wood to sell to feed my family. I was coming up a road, when suddenly a rider on a fiery horse appeared coming the other way. My poor mule was so frightened, she panicked, and dumped wood all across the road.  ‚ÄúThe horse was startled and bucked throwing its rider. The man fell hard, but he got up quickly, and I could see that it was none other than Pancho Villa himself! He was very angry, and he pulled two long pistols from his belt and pointed them at me.  ‚Äú‚ÄòCrazy peasant!‚Äô he yelled. ‚ÄòYou and your little shit mule were blocking the road! On your knees. You have thrown Pancho Villa into the dirt, and for that you will eat donkey biscuits!‚Äô  ‚ÄúWhat could I do?‚Äù asked the old man. ‚ÄúI knelt down and ate the donkey biscuits. It was horrible. My groan of disgust was too much for my mule. She was already scared, and she bolted past Pancho Villa knocking him down again.  ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt taking any chances. I leaped to my feet and grabbed on the pistols he had dropped. I leveled it at him! I was no one who deserved to be treated with such contempt! I said to him, ‚ÄòNow you will eat donkey biscuits!‚Äô  ‚ÄúWhat could he do? He ate slowly as he watched the barrel of his own gun pointed at him. Then I let him get up, catch his horse and ride off. He galloped down the road yelling threats to come back and kill me. But he himself was killed only shortly later.‚Äù  The researcher said the old man was almost sad as he sat there sipping tea. Then he looked at the researcher and said the words he would never forget, ‚ÄúSo Se√±or, when you ask me if I knew Pancho Villa... Did I know him? Se√±or, we had lunch together.""

I am certain that there are people out there who have done things similar to a PT test in the bomb suit to get their heart rates up, but one of the major issues is that the bomb suit really isn't flexible enough to do situps in it.  When I joined, we did a whole bunch of exercising and running around in MOPP 4 (pushups, situps, jumping jacks, leg lifts, squats, etc) and then did the same thing in a bomb suit, then got tested on making the requested amount of change out of a bunch of money tossed on the floor (tests dexterity in the bomb suit and your thinking), putting nuts/bolts together, picking up one 'landmine' at a time and putting it into a container without stepping over any of them (timed), and putting a HMMWV tire into a HMMWV (I think that they were just lazy on that one).

MilitaryStories,2ztkin,windowpuncher,5,Tue Mar 24 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you reminded me of a basic story.  Yeah, basic, I know.  Anyways, last FTX, Fort Sill, mid August.  Prime time for the animals.  Welcome to tent city, a ~4ish acre slab of land with concrete pads, sometimes with metal tent frames, and a shitload of sand burrs.  Now, some of these frames still had tents on them for whatever reason, with sandbags on the sides as usual.  Snakes, scorpions, spiders, and anything else creepy love these tents.  At night, snakes everywhere.  One evening, about 10pm, some guy in my tent finds a snake outside.  With his superior PV2 knowledge, he determines it's a garder snake, so everyone in the 20 person tent excluding me and 2 or 3 other guys goes over to play with the snake.  About an hour later, DS comes over to tell everyone lights out.  He steps into the tent, and before he even speaks a word, his eyes grow huge and he flips out, quickly readying the shovel he was carrying from nowhere, and chopping the snake's head off in one clean slice.  Turns out, DS as usual, was right.  That wasn't a garder snake at all, that was a motherfucking water moccasin.  Even with its head swiftly removed, the snake still didn't give up.  It was biting the spade DS was holding as DS was calling all the other DS' over.  Apparently, one of the other DS' was terrified of snakes.  This was very obvious, and the first DS took clear advantage of it.  He chased the second DS down for half an hour, brandishing the still somehow conscious snake head clinched on the shove.  Then we got yelled at, went to sleep, and got woken up every 20 mintes by propane canons for the rest of the FTX.  Besides a guy chasing a diamondback during land nav, but that's a different story."

There is an art to it, making a livable and comfortable fighting position, digging a useable foxhole. One becomes quite good at it with practice, heck, there is a subtle art to properly filling a sandbag even, the basic building block of a bunker. 2/3rds full of dirt, no more, tied high on the neck so the bag slumps into place just so. You can tell an amatuer built a position just by their too full sandbags. Less is more.  Thanks for your story."

I too gypsied around a war. It's weird - like you walk into a play already happening, you get to be on stage for Act I, scene 4, Act II Scenes 3 and 5, then some guy comes up tells you that you have to move on to another play at the next theater over.   You never find out what was going on. You never get to see the ending. You never know why those guys were pissed, why they were determined to do that inadvisable thing, how it all turned out...  What's funny is how that random shit stays with you. I still wake up in the middle of the night asking questions, What happened to those guys? Why were they way out there in the first place? Why was that guy wearing a pale tan cowboy hat?  Unsolved mysteries. I'm sure I was one too - some guy just passing through long enough to blow something up. You too, OP: ""Who WAS that guy, anyway? He kept wandering around looking at things like he'd just landed on the Moon. Then he just left again.""  ""I dunno. Plumber, I guess. He gave us a bill of materials and blew this pop stand.

Lol.  When I first got in at 17, in the 80's, My first Platoon Sargent, ""buck"" Burgess filled me in.  He was an admirable man, a Korean and Vietnam Veteran; A tanker allowed to wear the KEWL boots, a veteran of both the Big Red 1 and the 7th Cav.    He picked me out from day one, the first time we did cyclic inventory.  A gentle bad ass with one crazy sense of humor.  I remember getting the inventory detail for our squad and holding up every tool he named.  I even got internal, gripping, wrench, set, 1 ea.  10 minutes into the Inventory and he had me up front, center, and in charge under his guidance.  I was 17.  Did I say funny?    Imagine if you will, the effect of the following on 17 year old boy:  I was going into the latrine,  SFC Burgess was exiting said latrine with his paper.  He looked me dead in the eye with a twinkle and says ""Boy, that was a long turd, it had three rest notches in it.""  And keeps on walking.  I guess you had to be there, but I laughed for 20 years from that one."

I was in the 7th Cavalry, Alpha Five/Seven. We were in Indian Country out by the little Parrot's Beak. When we were inside the wire, the Division Band would come out and play ""Garry Owen"" for us, Custer's old travelin' music.   Props and a shout out to your Buck Sergeant, wherever he may be. You gotta have a sense of humor in the Cav, or it just gets depressing.   three rest notches in it.   Oh my. Didn't think you got those until you hit 65. They're only retrospectively funny.

The real Army designation is the M84 or XM84 depending on its date of manufacture. But lets just say that you're drunk, and got some numbers wrong. People onpost dont have access to grenades, training or otherwise outside of duty hours. Its not something that people get access to at the drop of a hat either. Few weeks before a training event(they prefer 6 weeks, but exceptions can be made), some guy has to put in the requisition for the grenades. Day of the training event, some poor bastard(and it has to be a specific poor bastard, he has to have certain liscensing and classess attended. He also needs to be on the Ammo Supply Point's memo to draw ammo) has to get up real early and drive to the Ammo Supply Point and pick that shit up. Then they drive it ot the range being worked on, then drive the residue back to the ASP and have it inventoried. The packaging it came in and the spoons and rings have to be accounted for so that they know that the grenades have been used, and not pocketed for a fun friday night or sold on the black market.   These rules get fuzzy deployed, but are freaking ironclad CONUS. No way did someone just happen to have a spare flashbang and decided to fuck around with it.  No way that a CSM can just waltz up into an active crime scene if there is a hostage situation.   So lets transition to the SEALs for a moment... Rangers believe they are hot shit, SEALs KNOW they are hot shit, so do you think they are clamoring to be like the other guy. Its like West Coast and East Coast levels of hatred and one-upping each other for bragging rights with anything and everything for Rangers ad SEALs.

In Michael Herr's book ""Dispatches"" about VN he once overheard the following while on a fire support base ""It's true!

MilitaryStories,2z7tp7,Dittybopper,6,Mon Mar 16 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"The fact that no matter where you are, you can get sports scores is hilarious. I didn't put it in here because I didn't remember it until I wrote this, but when we were walking towards that ambush we got traffic over the company net from the COP giving us the scores for the college football games back home.   IEDs were used almost exclusively to gum up the works, either to initiate a complex ambush (which the one in front no doubt would have been if we'd made it a little further before the ambush) or to simply delay us. After a heavy rain they'd go dig in as many as they could into the soft roads since the thermals couldn't tell the difference. We didn't have the fancy RCP tools that can see through the ground, only stuff that could detect the electrical signal on a good day. They didn't even work that well, once Chris took one and flailed it around above his head and it was going off. The common tactic was to wait for us to pass then go back in and hook them up and try to hit us on the way out as you see here. Even if they didn't blow us up, we'd be stuck and they'd have more time to set up an ambush, or just generally be dicks about it.  When all you want to do is go home, it's hard to fight complacency. We succumbed to it a bit at the very end here, but we'd also just cleared that area not an hour or two prior, so the risk was really low."
MilitaryStories,2z7tp7,Dittybopper,5,Tue Mar 17 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting, and thanks for the IED info. VC practiced the same sort of tactics, blow the first vehicle, blow the last, then cut the convoy in parts and defeat in detail. If they could of course, but there was one hell of a lot of US firepower to deal with and chopper and arty support coming sooner rather than later.   How good were the tali setting up ambushes? The VC were past masters of that game. Not, mind you, that I was ever in one, I was with the infantry but not part of them. Support role."

The Russian Invasion was halted in my valley and they never made it further. These are the same people who held off a massively outnumbering and better equipped force for a decade. It's these same people and their sons that we were fighting.  They'd wire up the pressure plates behind you, and usually a command wire or two, have an IED in front that you either hit or catch (They sprang their ambush a little early, probably because the three of us were in a great position to be cut off and killed). They'd pour it on as long as they could, they'd have the typical response times for arty and CAS down to the second and would pull back just before they could get there. Only way to ensure you killed them was to use WP to fence them in, since you can't run through it. Keep em fenced in and rain HE on them until fast movers get there and finish the job. Oftentimes they wouldn't blow the first OR the last vehicle, but one in the middle. The roads are so narrow there you can't maneuver around without going off a cliff, so you basically just cut a convoy in half.   That said, there were some times where they were actually retarded, I think sometimes they forgot they were fighting Americans and we fight differently from Russians."

Somewhere in here I posted about the kids we rolled up who'd emplaced an IED for us.  The general consensus was that we wished we could strap the fuckers to our lead mine-roller.

MilitaryStories,2yzbjb,spacetimetravel,17,Sat Mar 14 02:32:04 2015 UTC,"You asked about encounters with pilots, and this sort of qualifies. It is an excerpt from a long story about my toe.  While in garrison, to keep us sharp, we used a giant dome with a laser equipped Stinger model to practice tracking aircraft back home. It was like a giant version of the old Nintendo game ""Duck Hunt."" A plane would be projected, and you had to kill it before it made it off screen. Out in the desert, we spent hours doing aircraft recognition, but we couldn't practice tracking aircraft. So somehow, someone arranged for the USAF to do flybys of our positions so we could practice tracking them with the missiles and Vulcans. Sound like a good idea to you? Yeah, lets point heat seeking missiles and 20mm Guns of Death at our own aircraft. Excellent.  So a week or so after that is over, miraculously with no accidents, we are bored again. Until the air war started, there wasn't shit to do but train, play poker, have scorpion fights, and whack it. So we were REALLY bored. We see some planes flying by in the distance. So we got the missile out and pinged it with the IFF. The IFF is the ""Identification Friend or Foe."" We can tell if an aircraft is friendly or not. The aircraft can also tell they are being pinged and tracked.  We thought it was funny as hell to see a plane or helicopter serenely flying along, then suddenly start doing a bunch of evasive maneuvers. The other squads started doing it. So daily we would place bets on how severely a pilot would bank, climb and dive to avoid getting shot down. Yes, an entire battery of air defense was fucking with Army and Air Force pilots. Maybe that is why A 5/62 got deactivated shortly after Desert Storm. Anyway, at some point we had a battery formation, and we all get yelled at, but since they didn't know for sure who had been doing it, they couldn't punish anyone. We were told the USAF had been given orders to avoid our AO after that though. Back to the damn boredom."

It was a saturday night in Kandahar and I should have been in my rack as Sunday was our day off.  Instead, I was working late, again.  Yes, in the rear with the gear and at that time, I had never been out, beyond the wire.  I was first flight after the advance party and we were relieving the Combat Engineers attached to the 101 and the 82nd were yet to arrive.  I got bumped up flight because of my civilian experience in the chemical industry;  A Chemical Process Technician and because my specialty is water in both liquid and gaseous forms.  It had been a normal day in Kandahar, too hot and too dusty, and I had been working on a leak over by joint task force 11.  A dusty excuse for a road runs between JTC 11 and the SOF compound  and my 4"" water main crosses the road there.  Some fool engineer had put a joint in the middle of the road.  Not only was the join under the road, is was a friggin 45 degree turn.  With the joint under the road and the vehicle traffic passing over, movement had enlarged a leak in a poorly fitted 45 degree elbow about two feet below grade.  Someone had mixed English water pipe with metric fittings.    The week before, I had watched as two combat engineers showed me the ""field expedient"" method of mating a 4"" American Standard PVC pipe into a Metric Standard PVC fitting.  I had first watched them swab the inside of the black metric pipe with PVC cleaner and then watched in horror as these young men took turns, with a knife,  scraping plastic from the inside of the fitting to increase the diameter of the hole.  I swear to you, it took an hour to get a rough oval snapped hole.  I almost lost it there as I calculated how many of these hasty repairs would have to be redone.    The unit before me was going home and not interested in a permanent repair nor did they have parts as no one knew what to order;  None had civilian experience.  They had attempted to repair the leak by pouring concrete around the elbow as a brilliant solution for a hasty fix that leaked.  ""Fuck those mother fuckers"" I had thought when I finally uncovered a solid block of concrete 3 feet in diameter and encasing about 4 feet of the 4"" main, centered on the ell I needed to repair.  ""What the hell were those boys thinking"" I had asked myself, knowing they had one thing on their mind;  getting the hell out of Afghanistan.  The ditch witch was not going to handle this. So, I had to checkout a beat up SEE from the motor pool, nursed it to the job site, dug my hole, and then replaced the ell.  I had then back filled the hole and was in the process of packing it down with the bucket on my SEE.  It was 0 dark 30 and I was minding my own business, thinking about my rack, when suddenly I was surrounded by three very large Caucasian males in local dress that had suddenly appeared from the darkness.  They proceeded to interrogate me as if I were an enemy spy.  I was informed they were U.S. Navy SEALS and I became a bit excited... And a bit nervous. They then vaguely informed me that I, or some previous culprit, had cut a vital link between JTF11 and the SEAL section of the SOF compound.  Someone had cut the fiber optic cable linking the SEALS through JTC11 and then to home.  I had tried to evade the responsibility and had asked them WHEN and they had evaded me by being vague about exactly when they had noticed said loss.  Sure I was tired, sure they had no proof, sure the cable was not ""in scope"",  but they were SEALS, they needed me, and I had a ditch witch.  I don't bargain and I don't deal, so I simply said yes.  I do not use my position for personal gain and have pride.  It took a while before I got my ditch witch saddled and back to the job site.  In the darkness, it looked like a long way between JTC11 and the SOF compound.  I remember thinking with dread about how long the job might take.  I had barely gotten started when an army appeared out of the darkness, two elements;  one from SOF and another from the direction of JTC 11.  Before I knew it, the most unmilitary appearing army I had ever seen had me in a pincer movement.  They had tools, lights, shovels, and cable; everything necessary and now they had me and my ditch witch.  As my ditch witch attacked the sandy rocky soil this small army commenced a flanking maneuver.  Setting up lights, clearing rocks, and laying cable behind me.  Attacking the job.  They kept encouraging me that whole long night, working beside me, assisting me, and showing me by action who they really were.  They did not leave me alone and in the dark to toil.  The work went by so quickly, that I forgot I was tired, forgot I was working, and I even started to have fun.  You cannot imagine how impressive these men were when attacking the task of laying cable and filling a trench.  I watched them from the sale of my trusty steed as she rocked back an forth.  We were finished before I knew it.  They thanked me and I made my way back to the Engineers compound by the FET , all the while feeling like I had been part of something if only for a little while.  I reported in to the CQ and notified him that SPEC 4 Snelson would handle things for me as I needed some rack time.  I don't remember getting to my rack and must have slept the sleep of the dead.  I was woken entirely too early by someone telling me that some men where at the gate asking for the water boy and that ""this"" could not wait for my beauty sleep.  I vaguely remember getting up, dressing, and being led to the gate by a guard and finding two of the men I met the night before.  It was Sunday, so my fellow Engineers were around me, all looking slack jawed at two SEALS in our compound and wondering just what the hell would they want the water boy for.  I was tired and approached with dread at the thought of more work.  One of the men had a large black trash bag that looked like a body bag, bulging with something heavy.  I remember them thanking me for the assist in front of everyone and handing me the large bag as reward.  Sure it was nothing.  To me though, I was better than a medal and was being presented to me, by a SEAL, and in front of my brothers.  I can't even remember them leaving, because when I opened the bag, I was momentarily stunned by the most beautiful site I had seen since stateside.  For, in the bag I held in my hands, were 50 frozen hamburger patties.    I almost freaked at the sight of this bounty.  The windows of heaven had just opened up and bestowed on me the gift meat.  Meat!!!!  When all around me is MRE, T-RAT, or pogie bait.  When everywhere is sand, dirt, and misery.  I remember my head swelling slightly as my chest expanded.  I remember being aware of the desire and longing in my audiences eyes.  Saliva had dripped from their open mouths and down their jowls when they saw what was in MY bag.  All eyes were on me and the treasure I held in my hands.   The anticipation was evident in their eyes and I could not let them down.  Like the pope administering the sacrament, I began to issue these patties as if they were holy and each a gift from the gods to the poor benighted souls around me.  It is so much better when you are rewarded than when you have to ask.  It felt good to share the story and the reward with my brothers.  I did keep two for myself."

That being said, the issue with SF stories, is that most of the good ones are still classified. Even some stuff from Vietnam, though they're more likely to have stories that are now unclassified than the rest of us. There's only one actual mission I was on that had SF involvement that I can talk about, and one incidental encounter a friend had. All the times we hit targets with them or were on QRF for them are still classified.   None of us want to be the guy that outs a Quiet Professional.   Regarding your SOF desires, if there's one thing I would advise you, it would be to join a line (Infantry) unit first. Earn your stripes there, then drop a packet for selection. 99% of the initial accessions for the 18X option fail out, or get selected but don't get to the Q-course because they have no experience. Go to a line unit, be a superstud, get some stripes, a combat deployment (hopefully) under your belt then drop your packet. You'll be better for it and know how the regular Army works too."

I'm going to second ColdSteelRain's advice - don't go straight for SF.  Enlist as an 11B (Infantryman) and earn your E5 there, then go to SOPC and the Q course.  Spend extra time on land nav before you go, and get many many hours under your ruck.  Best of luck, hopefully you'll be back with some stories of your own in a few years."

MilitaryStories,2ysvmg,RantNRave31,5,Thu Mar 12 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes quiet calm is all you got, all you get, all anyone gets. You can‚Äôt knife-hand steel. If some Dishka had started ventilating that Chinook with 12.7 mm holes, OP, you would have been in exactly the same boat as Mr. OGA.  I went to law school late in life. I was there with mostly people who had just graduated from college. It was an interesting transition to see. The first three years of college, you‚Äôre broadening your horizons, learning more and more about more and more. The last year of college, you specialize - you begin learning more and more about less and less - and law school is just a continuation of that descent into minutia. The trouble is that young people don‚Äôt notice the transition. I graduated from law school with 200 or so youngsters who were convinced that anyone who had studied hard, like them, for seven years would necessarily know the same things they knew and think the same way they were thinking. Everything they didn‚Äôt know couldn‚Äôt be that important, otherwise there would‚Äôve been a class on it.  Not a sensible mindset, I think, however much one may admire someone who has mastered the intricacies of the law.   The first knife-biter I ever met set me back on my heels. He was a Marine Gunnery sergeant. He had low-crawled across the DMZ, dispatched unsuspecting NVA sentries with a KA-BAR, done a bunch of other sneaky-pete things that he could tell you about, but then he‚Äôll have to kill you. I first saw him fighting with sunlight, bare-chested and balanced, pivoting and slashing. He was kind of a legend in I Corps.  He died in Dong Ha, a couple of weeks later. Artillery round from across the DMZ. No warning. He never knew what hit him.   Seemed like a waste, like an unworthy death for such a man. But then I thought Shrapnel. I dodge shrapnel. We take the same risks. He was unlucky. Could be ME next! So there it was.  And there you were OP. On the same helicopter. At that point you both were equally heroic. I‚Äôll give you ten to one that Mr. OGA knew that. You deserved that nod, just as much as he did.  I understand that the martial arts - all of the martial arts including weapon use - are both a skill set and a way of thinking that benefit a man, especially a soldier. I also understand that for certain risky missions, the marginal advantage these skills give a soldier can be critical. I honor those who master such things.   But I don‚Äôt revere them. There is a point of diminishing returns in the obsessive study of martial arts - or any art - a point where one begins to learn more and more about less and less, a point where the study itself becomes an affectation, mere posturing. I don‚Äôt admire that. I don‚Äôt admire the sense of sneering superiority that sometimes accompanies those acquired skills.  Bill Hickok was shot in the back by a crying, panicky boy. Medals of Honor go to Special Forces people and cooks, too. The Shrapnel God hovers over us all, not equally, and not only those of us who master all the arts of warfare. All. If you put on the uniform, when the enemy comes, he‚Äôs coming for you. Wherever you are, whatever job you do. All.  Good post, OP. Well writ. Got me thinkin‚Äô."

Your story is quite coherent, I tracked it right along and it popped old memories several times. With time we tend to forget how damned miserable it actually was, the heat and sweat, those cracked and sore hands, the grime and dust or being soaked to the bone and chilled for days on end. Your story was evocative of all of that and I enjoyed it.  My first cigarette ever was smoked soon after a black SFC accidentally fired a 45 round just to the right of my face, the round spalling concrete shards into my neck and head. He had been cleaning his pistol about 30 foot away, I hadn't paid much attention to him, there were a lot of us on the roof of the Fishnet Factory building that afternoon. The fool finished cleaning the weapon then loaded a mag and chambered a round, BLAM! After the round smashed into to low wall I had ""hit the dirt"" in a flash, sprawled on the concrete roof crabbing away from the impact my mind screaming WTF! I had no idea where the fire was coming from. The next thing I know the SFC is in my face apologizing which caused me to be in his face screaming bloody murder.   When things settled down, the two of us separated, and the embarrassed sergeant gone, incident over except that I was still shaking and agitated. I sat back down and the thing that caught my eye was on of those four-cig packs of Marlboro's from a C-ration meal. Without really thinking I opened it and extracted a cigarette and lit it. Cig's then rapidly became my pacifiers, I was nearing the end of my year in-country and a mental basket case.   That day I joined the ranks of smokers. Before that I had swore I'd never smoke, hated being around smokers actually because my mom was a constant smoker and when I was growing up the house always stank of stale smoke and her over full ashtrays were everywhere. Disgusting habit."

Sounds like the sort of time when a cigarette is pretty appropriate.  One of our Grunts' First Shirt's shot one of his Joe's in Kuwait, pre-invasion.  Same thing.  Cleaning his weapon, was a retard, shot one of his guys and got himself relieved.  The guy he shot was okay, but he missed out on the fun.  Seems like the more rank, the more dangerous the sidearm.  At one point our entire Platoon smoked.  Even guys who had never smoked before, were dead set against it, started bumming.  Even the LT.  Trip out.  God, I smoked two, sometimes three packs a day, maybe more.  Smokes and war, though, they fit together perfectly.  I quit saturday before last."

MilitaryStories,2yahej,ColdSteelRain,9,Sun Mar 8 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Outstanding. Well writ, and in present tense. Dang.  I too was surprised that you were allowed to use WP rounds, OP. For those who don't know, White Phosphorous is a lovely smoke round - thick smoke. It marks its impact with a precision that can be easily seen by tac air. I didn't even know they had a 60mm round.  I would use a battery one (six tubes) of WP for snipers. I figured I could either put smoke (not WP) on us, or smoke on the sniper. A nice thick cloud of smoke is just what I need around a sniper - makes it easier to medivac our people, get out of his range or sneak up on him. If, as a purely collateral event, he died a horrible, agonizing death... eh, you shouldn't snipe, man. That's what happens if you do.  Good story, OP - as good as I've seen on this subreddit, and that's saying something."
MilitaryStories,2yahej,AnathemaMaranatha,4,Sun Mar 8 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"That's very high praise, I'm flattered.  We used WP all the time. Often times when taking IDF we'd blanket all the possible escape routes with WP so nothing could move through it, and then tell the fast movers to look for targets marked with smoke. Boom.   Nowadays 60s have everything except Red Phos. On a mission we'd have HE and WP in our bags, with a can or two of regular and IR Illum rounds strapped in the fuel can slot on the backs of the trucks, and a few more cans of HE and WP on trucks as well, and usually easy of the Bravos would carry an HE round or two. Rounds in bags had safeties already pulled, last thing you want to do during a TIC is forget and have your round lawn dart. Rounds in cases on trucks still had safety pins, because if the truck goes up, you don't want the rounds detonating.   We even got to a point towards the end where if the bad guys holed up in a compound, we'd ground burst an illum round right in the center and catch it on fire. We were psychotic motherfuckers."

When you talked about yells of pain after your impacts, I could hear my boys in my head hootin' and hollerin'. The only thing better is a big-ass secondary explosion.   Can't imagine dealing with WP mortar rounds. Fucking scary stuff. I carried two WP grenades, one on my ruck strap, one on the ruck. Goddamned things scared me to death, just having them around.  I used WP for marking rounds - 600 meters up on a four digit grid, take an azimuth and measure flash-to-bang one mississippi, two mississippi... Never used them for smoke except to mark for tac air and snipers.   Snipers piss me off. Pissed all of us off. I was watching the History Channel thing on that ace sniper in Fallujah; it was confusing. Don't like being sniped at. It's really personal. People take it badly. Now that snipers are our current heroes, I find I have to keep my mouth shut. I want to chat about how you solve that particular problem.   Not welcome in the current milieu.

Alright assholes, I can play that game too.   As far as I'm concerned, I did the most humane thing possible and make sure they died, not living on while being horribly maimed and crippled like they too often did to us.   If I've been drug across the world because you assholes can't get your shit together and be civilized, I'm bring some motherfuckin' pain with me. Better believe it. Get your shit together assholes, so I don't have to come visit a second time. Best way to handle that stuff in my humble opinion.   It's one thing to shoot at me, another to fuck with my boys.

I'm not really sure why this is, we were never directly told this way of waking each other and it's not a policy that I'm aware of, nor was it discussed within my hearing.

Thank God I got my coffee first. Jesus. Fuckin' engineers. What're you doing? You just wake up one morning and decide to explode your brain on the internet? I believe a courtesy ""Fire in the hole!"" is customary.  Just to get even, I'm gonna read your future, OP. I don't need a crystal ball, just memory. Since you got yer essay on, I've been sitting here counting the people and things in my life. Here are the things that matter: none. Here are the people in the last 46 years that I'd die for: two. Here are the people that I'd risk everything for, including my life: maybe six, some of whom I don't even speak to anymore. Here are the people I'd want beside me when the shit goes down: again, maybe six, some of 'em dead.  Then when you hit 46 years down the timeline, the stats explode. So many things and people I can't count them. Lots of things matter that don't matter squat anymore. People I hardly knew. My people.   I once was trying to tell something about Vietnam to a pretty, intelligent, well-read and educated lady who had a snappish quality and a peacenik bent. I was just rambling on, and she was getting more and more pissed. She was SO pretty, I didn't notice her fuming until she piped up, ""You keep calling them your 'people!' You sound like you OWNed them! Do you mean you were in command of them? Were they somehow less than you because they weren't officers? They were your fellow soldiers!""  She went on like that, but I lost the thread of it. I was gobstopped. As smart and educated as she was (pretty, too - that was important), she had gotten EVERYthing I was saying bass-ackward. There was NO way she could understand what I was saying. None. All those things that I thought made people smart - education, reading, study - were worthless when it came to some things, important things.  I lost track of her Jeremiad about democracy and human worth. I'm sure she was passionate and literate about it - but I could not hear her either. She kept talking about human worth in a way - it seemed obvious to me - that nothing to do with human worth.   It didn't matter. I had just come to FULL STOP - just like this morning. I was overwhelmed for the first time - but not the last time - that I was alone here. I never answered her, never saw her again. Might as well answer her here:  ""My people. My god, lady. I didn't own them. They owned me.""   Still do. Heads-up!, OP."
MilitaryStories,2x6ygs,Shpadoinkles,9,Thu Feb 26 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"""My people. My god, lady. I didn't own them. They owned me.""    God how true this is.  I have a pen, a nicer than Skillcraft pen mind you, but just a pen purchased from the PX that PV2 Shinkle and PFC Diamond purchased for me with their own money and of their own accord as I was PCSing from Korea in 2001.  (fuck, 14 years already!!??)  That pen means more to me than any PCS plaque, award or flag I've ever owned.  There wasn't a ceremony, or a big deal.  They came up to me and said thank you for all you've taught us.  I still tear up thinking about it because I'd written negative counseling statements on both and an Article 15 on one.  That squad of 6 misfits in the platoon of 20ish misfits still have a place in my heart.   Finkle, such a good b-ball player, so much potential but definitely needed a strong guiding hand.  Towne, not the brightest guy but thorough and dependable.  Shinkle, she had some daddy issues that presented several times but when I left she was strong, independent and had stood up for herself several times which was new to her. Diamond, the only Joe to ever make me take my rank off.  We spent our time behind the Con-Ex in the motor pool, he had his shot and after it was all said and done I still had respect for him and he grew up a bit. He lost and that was the end of it.  Esser, this dude was brilliant.  Too smart for the Army, too smart for lower enlisted at least and not patient enough to go OCS.  None of those are on my ""risk it all"" short list, but they're still mine and I theirs."

Met a talented and artistic woman who was adamant that beauty should be made. She had something lovely to do. I could help. So began the most honest 20 years of work I ever did.   You words mean much to me right now.   I hear. I lucked out about 30 years ago. Got ""voluntarily"" committed to the VA Psych Ward. Group therapy with all those fucked up guys let me know that if I was crazy, I wasn't alone.  Read about it here and here and here, if you're of a mind to.   The other thing that happened was discovering the community in this subreddit and /r/Military about two years ago. I had a ton of stuff I needed to sort out. This place let me write for an audience that you can't get anywhere else.   Civilians just don't get it - I'd tell some story that I thought was funny, and people would want to comfort me. Or were horrified. Not here. Make yourself at home. This is home. You can explain what's bothering you without having to explain everything. Nice people. Brothers and sisters who have ears that can hear what you're saying.  Like my old group therapy without any actual threat of personal injury. I'd say it's a step up."

Today a vet dressed me down.  He said my sarcasm... Was veiled anger?  Then I read the original post... With comments and then look at myself.    I'm am no longer around people I can admire and respect. Look up to. A dessert of lack of character.  thanks again
MilitaryStories,2x6ygs,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Fri Feb 27 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Today a vet dressed me down. He said my sarcasm... Was veiled anger?   Could be just that, no? I did that - tried to disguise what I had to say with humor, tried to make things that seemed important to me seem like an amusing thing of no real consequence. That is what happens when you are unsure of your audience, unsure of whether you really belong among such people.  Know this: Everything you have to say here - no matter how carefully you disguise it - arises from something you need to say. You don't remember things that don't matter. And the things you can't forget... those are the things that matter.  However you say these important things, there is someone here who can hear what you really meant to say. People will not always be kind. Sometimes they will ask you to cut the bullshit and say what you mean. Sometimes they will forget how hard it is to say things straight up after so many years alone among those who cannot understand.  But someone will hear you. More than one, many more.   Say what you need to say as best you can. If you don't know what that is... then say that. You are among comrades here, and you have finally decided to speak. That's huge. There are hundreds reading in silence who need to hear you and know that they are not alone. No matter what you say, no matter how badly you mangle what you truly want to say, there are silent warriors out there to whom you will be the person - at last! - who can be admired and respected.  Stay with us brother. Write when the spirit moves you. You're in rough company. People will not always be gentle. But you will be heard. You are not alone."

It takes time, we're here so you can bounce things off of, we can provide insight because we're all in the process. None of us will ever complete the process of accepting the losses we've known. It is simply not possible. But we can learn to live with it all, that is quite possible and doable. I can tell you're not broken, I totally understand the feeling of loss you spoke of. Me too. As /u/AM said we are all comrades, this is a place you can be yourself and voice your feelings, that anger. We have, several of us, been doing the process for a long damned time and have mostly come to terms with matters. That means we have wisdom to impart and are most willing to do so. Avail yourself of that if you feel you need it."
MilitaryStories,2x6ygs,RantNRave31,4,Fri Feb 27 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"Why do I feel this way?  Part 1  I am not like you guys.  Maybe I'm just having a midlife crisis.  But... The whole feelings thing sort of got to me.  That and a friend of mine dressed me down for sarcasm. Veiled anger.  What?  Me?  Noooooo, I'm funny.  Right?  Then came the above comments.  Engineer, explosion, fire in the hole.  A bit painful as I read somethings that fit me loosely and others that fit me exactly.  The two men above linked interesting reading.  Why do I relate?  The comments strike me hard!  These men are heros.  I feel my tail wag.  I am a dog.  I am an Engineer.  The water boy, SGT Bobby ""pigpen"" Bouche' from Louisiana.  I feel insignificant and unworthy when I compare myself to you, my heros.  But,  I have had PTSD since childhood.  I was a beaten dog from the get go.  My real father an alcoholic loser.  I learned to NEVER look him in the eye.  When I look down, it is not because I lie.   My earliest memory is that of being knocked from my high chair because I wouldn't eat his fried fish.  I had nightmares of a babbling giant tormenting me till my teens.  The giant broke in and raped my mom once.  I hid in the closet.  Powerless.    At 5, a young teenage baby sitter who was probably too ugly to catch a boy her age messed with me.  Little girls get molested, little boys get educated. Right?  Blah blah blah.  Every one has a sob story that defines them.  It is how you CHOOSE that separates you from others.  Until I was 8  I accidently passed this disease on to others my age before my step dad taught me it was wrong.  God forgive me. God bless him.  My Navy step father, the boy scouts, and the army gave me some character and a little spine.  They taught me that disciple should not be personal.  And showed me.  Showed me.  That is why I ask questions.  Once I found out drills were like my dad?  Like my Uncle the drill Sargent.  Like The Vietnam vets I met as a kid.  The stories and the attention.  I wanted it all.  Even negative attention of pushups was better than none.  Especially when it isn't personal.  I loved them.  I worship them.  One vet I met as a child lived in a pop up.  From park to park.  Told me stories everyday till my mom yanked me.  I envied him.  I wanted to be him.  I didn't know he suffered.  He was SAFE.  HE would NEVER.  Mom was over protective.  But, I was still the boy hiding in the library, Reading Robert Heinlein, Larry Niven, and Jerry Pournel.  David Drake.  I was a boy that had stars in my eyes.  I read and dreamed about heros.  Early childhood trauma.  I learned to think under stress at an early age.  I imitated Examples of character I never had, some good and some bad.  Just followed.  E-5 for 10 years.  I couldn't keep my mouth shut.  But I scored in 98.5th percentile on my ASVAB.  Yeah.  Smarter than all those ""pretty boys"".  Too good to let go.  But I was always broken a bit on the inside.  I did hit 40 out of 40 seven out of fifteen years in the Guard.  It was an honor when an combat troop would make the mistake of betting me on the range.  Me an ""Betsy"" my A-2 ""musket.""  We rarely miss.  ""What?  The plumber kicked your ass?""  Now, I am an Engineer.  I can build anything, anywhere, anytime and you can't stop me.  There is not a trade I do not know.  Jack of all trades but master of none.  I even write the software.  I am proud.  A BSM for excellence... Not valor, while in Afghanistan.  I built more shitters than you can imagine in places most people only read about.  I know more about solids, liquids, and gasses especially water than most people.  I know how to obtain it, store it, distill it, soften it, freeze it, move it and yes, sometimes,  Shower in it.  I WAS Appreciated.  I even got an AAM from some great SOF guys that had never had a hot shower in a FOB.  I put a 500 gal tank on the roof we built them, gravity fed to a water heater I was SO proud of.  Excellence.  Not Valor. They HAD a 5 gal water can, sprayed black to absorb heat.  A port a potie with a fish pump to rinse.  Till SGT pigpen got there.  Proud.  They wouldn't let us go back for 19 days, finding excuses and work to keep us busy.  We cooked them a shrimp stew.  Louisiana style.  They had the first real food I had seen in ages.  They loved us.  Proud.  One green beret let me fire his sniper rifle.  I got a chubbie and wagged my tail.  They were impressive and with a character I can only admire.  I have never felt safer and I can see Pakistan from here.  And they were as rough looking as me.  Get-r-done. They called me ""water boy"" and I just wagged my tail.  My heros.  You CANNOT understand.  Top secret mission to ""if we tell you we gotta kill you"" on a blacked out Chinook.  OGA's water pipes frozen.  Leader recon.  Another shitter KIA from the cold.  I felt like a big kid back then, playing Q for James Bond.  Living a movie surrounded by my heros.  I have funny stories that are not, when I tell them now.  I remember everything.  I remember everyone.  After reading some things and learning.  Why do I feel this way?"
MilitaryStories,2x6ygs,RantNRave31,3,Sun Mar 1 01:22:10 2015 UTC,"Why do I feel this way?  I have never fired a shot in anger or combat.  I have however, been held at gun point and even shot at once.   In Afghanistan rounds fell in my A.O.  You guys do know it comes down right?  Angle too steep for a sniper.  It was a pucker moment though.  Turtle up.  I have woken up hugging the floor in fear.  Mortar?  Mine? RPG!  Guy in a sister unit lost a leg in mine clearing.  Once, in the field, I went to urinate and I almost stepped on a mine.  Another pucker moment let me tell you.  Every time they clear an anti-tank mine I have another pucker moment.  Once, I even got to see half a HUMVEE fly.  From 1200 meters away when I went out with EOD.  I watched my first mushroom cloud from the ruins of a old Russian base.  Once, a convoy I was in got split in half.  The other half got attacked.  Pucker.  A stranger I met at chow died a month after I met him.   He was a good kid.  I don't remember his name.  I remember his face.  Another boy that used my showers died.  Head shot.  Accident.  it was nothing like you guys.  But I'm not civilian any more. Infantry get angry...plumbers shouldn't.  Right?  Feelings.  Why in every story I write do portray myself as that boy I remember?  The big kid.  But he has a foul mouth like I do now?  HE was not angry.  He was living his dream.  I have seen death.  Even before Afghanistan.  A parents suicide, a wreck, so many funerals.  In Afghanistan  I saw a pile of bodies. A  Gunshot wound.  Some fingers blown off.  I saw puddles of congealed bodily fluids where the 101 cleaned house.  I saw a Pashtu arm, no Pashtu.  Everywhere I went, I saw flies, these horrible flies on everything, on bodies, fluids, and feces.  They would get on me, on my food.  In my nose.  My mouth.  Faughhhh.  There was a plain dotted with hundreds of human ""cow patties"" where I could hear the flies buzz. Not one piece of toilet paper in sight.  What do they wipe with?  I now know why the primates middle finger is longer.  Why that finger is an insult and the left middle finger the deadliest of insult.  Why they taught us in formal dining to not touch food with the left.  That is custom everywhere.  Ecoli kills.  I rode through a refugee camp, 200,000 kids.  I sure didn't see any of that crap on the commercials.  No red cross no churches...no camera crews.  Where the fuck were the relief organizations?  Just kids starving and living in some blown up buildings.  An ocean of poor little kids parting like a wave in front of our 5-ton.  We did Mardi Gras... I could hear in my memory ""throw me something mister."". I threw everything.  MRE candy, my poggie bait.  A whole bag of jolly ranchers, one at a time.  A story of its own.  Then one day nothing bothered me.  I didn't feel a thing.  I slept so much better.  I'd rather die than lose sleep or worry.  Being scared is exhausting.  It reminded me of the hump halfway through basic.  I threw up, dried my eyes, and drove on.  A guy got shot in the head.  I heard and faked empathy.  I didn't know him.  Whew.  I feel nothing.  That is a good thing, right?  I remember before.  I remember after.  I sat down in a dust storm at a pick nick table under a dining fly.  Back before Khandahar had a PX or Dining Hall.  When it was the wild wild west about 6 months after H hour.  The 101 ready to go home and the 82 were taking over.  Panther 6 sounded so kewl.  I was Crunching gritty dirty food and not even a complaint.  A big nasty jihad fly lands and does reconnaissance on my t-rat.  He calls in for support.  When they arrive, rubbing their greedy little hands, I record number and arms.  And I just watched and ate around them and whatever mission the were on.  I finally got pissed because they wouldn't leave.  I gave them plenty of time.  They wouldn't LEAVE, Not even if you flicked them.  They just get back up, limp over to my food, and stare at me.  I think I lost it.  They would rather die than fly in this heat.  So I KILLED HIM,  and ate his ass, thinking ""FUCK YOU"".  I didn't care anymore where he had been or what he had on his feet.  Fuck him and his little maggot friends.  ""seven flies with one blow."" It was a fucking massacre.  They didn't stand a chance after I ate the leader.  The grunts nearby scoot away and ignore my crackup and kept eating their flies.  I had these two intimate friends:  Compassion and Empathy.  I was practically born with them.  They went with me to kindergarten thru high school.  They even graduated with me.  They joined the Guard when I did.  They ETS'd with me.  We missed it so much we had to all reup.  They went to Afghanistan with me.  They didn't make it back.  I don't know how or why I lost them or even exactly where.  Sometime before the fly incident.  I remember I used to cry for strangers.  Compassion went MIA.  I remember I used to feel for strangers.  Empathy went MIA.  Now I only feel for those I know.  I really do not want to know anyone else too closely, as they too, will leave or die.  That part of the above comments struck me again and again.  It hurt.  The handful.  The few.  I thought I was fine.  At least I could sleep.  I bragged I could sleep through anything.  Even artillery fire.  I wanted to die... Just not for nothing.  Feelings.   Anger for no reason.  No one to blame.  Nowhere to point it.  Ignorance seems to be the blame.  No standard of excellence and development.  Civilian leaders use you and fail to reward.  You have to ask for raises?  Not their fault.  Ignorance.  In the past, PTSD was normal.  The lions, tigers, and bears got the dumb ones.  Every survivor had some form of PTSD.  Now, I and those like me, are the aberration.  When you boot them they take it personal.  I have to say please in a respectful tone when asking them to perform tasks they are paid for.  ""will you please do your job?"" I wait for the tantrum to end.  ""why me?"" They cry as if it were personal.  They drop paper and get mad when I make them pick it up.  The process is slower than I like, I have seen better.  Boot, don't Piss.  A man calls and asks ""it says 'click next' to continue.  What should I do?"" And I freak out on the inside.  It recently escaped before I could stop it.  No damage but feelings.  I hear the comment ""do not teach me, tell me what to do."" And I want to strike the individual and then realize he doesn't know any better.  All I see about me are... Training deficiencies.  BOLOs.  NOGOs.  I see a civilian ride my coworker into the ground.  He relapses.  IED, Iraq.  He snaps and loses his shit.  The civilian didn't know any better.  Ignorance.  Some inconsiderate person leaves a cart and I watch the wind carry it into another vehicle.  The person saw and ignored.  I want to shout ""put that shit up.""  I don't want to scare them.  Me.  Ha ha.  The book worm.  I can't believe this.  I just can't handle the way they look at me.  Ma'am?  You don't know what a switch is?  Do you remember Andy Griffith?  Yes... The switch board operator.  Now please look for any switching equipment like a modem, router, or access point.  Why does this bother me?  Because if any of these people were involved I something dangerous they would get someone killed?  Sloppy?  They panic over things than mean nothing and ignore things they should not.  I envy them their ignorance.  This anger that has been escaping in sarcasm and rages that scare people I would never hurt is isolating me.  People that I would fucking DIE for.  I'm not a that!  Never.  It is eating me up an now you boys have done gone and made me cry.  For three days.  I'm starting to feel something again but I don't like it.  Yall had it rough.  No appreciation.  No thank you.  No Kevlar.  No bullet proof vest's.  All those young boys paying the price and  Then you came home to civilians and a news media gone mad. And all I'm having is a mid life crisis."

No shit, go and seek it, get it, start the road back, its that or continue in anger, numbness, depression and hopelessness which would totally suck the big one. I can't possibly deal with all that is going on with you, I can tell you that I have seen it before, tried to help others suffering as you are. I couldn't do a hell of a lot for the simple reason its not what I do, not what I'm trained to do, I'm a layman here and I can readily tell I'm out of my depth with you and the extent of your present, well, emanate crash (you sound like you're damned close). Get help at the VA, they know, they deal with what is happening to you on a regular basis and since the Vietnam era are far far better at it.  I want you to overcome, to live what life is left for you in a better place, a better ""head-space."" Life is short, you're about 5/10ths done age wise, perhaps a bit further. Still time to make a renewed beginning, still time to experience the wonder that is living on this often screwed up planet (the planets fine [kinda], its the people). Experience the highs and the lows after learning some stuff at the VA. What you need is understanding in how to deal with those ups and especially the downs. That, I guarantee you, is possible if you receive the training and coping skills. Without them though, you're fucked.  Find that VA facility, get the help you so desperately need ASAP. To delay is to prolong and that is a shit life choice.   It took me eight years to finally ""feel something"" after returning from the war. At my mothers funeral it was, me shoving dirt into her grave (I didn't have to do that, I wanted to do it) - after a few shovel fulls I broke down in a heap, tears, feelings - it was fucking wonderful to know I had that in me still, to discover I could feel again. I'm better now, its taken 45 years. Don't do that to yourself, there was no real help for me back then, there most definitely is for you. And you DESERVE, earned, every damned bit of it.

MilitaryStories,2x6ygs,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Mon Mar 2 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Okay then.  I‚Äôm going to tell you a story. Not mine. Just something I saw that might help you.  When I found myself in the VA Psych ward - my god, it was almost thirty years ago - they bunked me in a room with four other guys. I was told that four of us would be watching out for the fifth man. Ted was a mess. He was so fuzzed out by the meds they were bombing him with, he couldn‚Äôt find the latrine, couldn‚Äôt remember which bed was his, had no idea where he was. He had been like that for a couple of weeks, they said, as the staff kept trying different cocktails of drugs to see what might work.  Ted was an engineer in civilian life. I guess he had just slowly come apart - his mind seemed to fragment, no ability to concentrate, kept interrupting himself with new things, old things, stuff he remembered. Wasn‚Äôt crazy stuff - well, some of it was - but mostly things that were on his mind, some important, some that needed tending to, some that just sort of popped up out the past. He lost his ability to bring order to those thoughts. By the time he hit the ward, he was scattered from here to there, seemed like no one was at the controls.  Psychiatric medicine covers a lot of things that really don‚Äôt have too much to do with each other. On the ward, we divided ourselves into the psychotics and depressives. I was a depressive. We were bottomed out, but functional. We had a long slog ahead of us - AA for most of us, anti-depressants that didn‚Äôt work very well, group therapy, learn coping skills, learn how to live with depression.  The staff seemed to have a whole other idea about the psychotics. They treated paranoia and schizophrenia like a chemical event. Get the right chemical formula and voila! The brain turns itself right side up, and the command personality resumes control of all the wayward and noisy parts. I don‚Äôt want to downplay what these guys were going through - it looked terrifying, like the world had stopped making any sense somehow, gone rogue and random. They were panicked and ashamed of their panic. From where I sat, they had good reason to panic.  Ted kept having lucid moments where he looked around and tried to make sense of his surroundings. When he could assemble enough of himself, he was horrified. He had a family, a job, responsibilities. Then the fuzz of drugs would descend and he was the mush-mouthed invalid we all had to tend to.  As a week or so passed, Ted started waking up more and more, mostly in the afternoon. He could vaguely remember who we were, where he was. The periods of lucidity got longer and longer. He got visitors - a woman who looked like her life had collapsed around her, SO happy to see him back, so sad to see him fall back into the drug haze.  Time passed, maybe three weeks. Ted was dressed in civvies, a nice outfit - he looked like a professional guy, an engineer. He was sort of puzzled by all the men around him who seemed to know him well, who were very happy for him. His wife showed up, looking worried and happy. Two twenty-something boys, too. Ted‚Äôs family looked at us like... well, like we were friendly, possibly crazy people. She was in a hurry to get Ted out of there.  As far as I know, he went back to his life. He didn‚Äôt return while I was at the hospital as an out-patient for two years doing group therapy and some staff treatment.  I‚Äôm not a doctor. I just saw this one thing happen, and I mention it here because I know you‚Äôre about to encounter one person after another who will be professionally cautious and tell you how long treatment might take, how it may not be successful. I saw Ted - a success as far as I could tell. Thirty years ago. So it‚Äôs possible. They‚Äôve been working on those meds for three decades now. I bet they have something that will help you. It‚Äôs a good risk.  As for whether you‚Äôre worthy of all this attention - yes, yes you are. Ted helped me. I was in the lowest place I have ever been. It helped me to tend to Ted. All of us in the ward went back to a military place when ‚Äúno man left behind‚Äù had a meaning and was our mission. We all felt weak and stupid and like hammered dogshit. We were all failures, pathetic. But we could do that - help Ted, help each other.   Help you too. You helped others. They don‚Äôt really give a BSM to E-5s for nothing. It‚Äôs your turn on the gurney, that‚Äôs all. Let them do their jobs. Let them help.  Keep us posted."

I was in the same old mental shit-hole. I dunno. It just got better. Became a nice shit-hole. Hardly shitty at all.  All the stuff that dropped me in my tracks is still here. I just didn't die. I turned and looked it square in the eye, let it knock the stuffings out of me. And when it finished, I was surprised to find I wasn't dead yet. So I asked it all, ""You done? What now?""  And all that shit said, ""Fuck if I know. Yeah, I'm pretty much done.""  So I moved on. I just kind of drifted - like Odysseus clinging to a shred of his wrecked ship - and I washed up somewhere, and people showed up and something happened.  I won't go into details because what happened to me won't be the same thing that'll happen to you if you decide to stick around. But whatever happens to you will probably be better. You can only roll around in your own shit so long. You get bored. Then things get better.  It's possible. That's all I got. Wish someone had told me. Would've been good to know."

Still it was the army so a battered sensibility was built in for me also. I worked with lots of highly intelligent frat types doing inside work until I got to VN then I learned what armies and soldiering were really about and where my responsibility lay in all that.

A million little stresses chip away at the excess life before service add on to you and that shared experience, the harshness and brotherhood give you an appreciation of comraderie that tells you it's value and makes you hold it for the ones worth it. It can make you seem cold to people who don't know... but to those who do know? It's a bond."

I don't understand pieces of lingo but I try very hard to find a frame of reference within my own life to relate or try to understand. I have never nor will ever walk a single step in any of your boots. With that said, this post and it's comments have resounded loud and clear deep within my soul. I had a two hour festival of tears with my husband as support after reading these incredibly raw and real sharing of emotions, fears and the support for getting help.   I have left an almost twenty year long career as a RN. Have worked in the most specialized areas of nursing from the first day I laced my duty shoes. The more training I took the more specialized I became. Until every moment of every day was immediate life or immediate death and I lost me. I lost everything I was and wasn't. I became a shell with no soul. I can relate to your feelings. To your feelings of isolation. To so much. No one outside of the team I worked with understands me. (Husband and son being the exceptions) Because they have never walked in my shoes.   This is the only thing I will ever post here. Please know there are civilians who want to know the things you have gone through. We want to understand. We want to make the country and society you come home to as one that you feel no isolation in.   Please know there are civilians who come here to ride the coat tails of the support you are all so amazing at giving to each other.  Thank you for this thread. It is beautiful. Thank you to each of you for you. This world is a better place for having you in it. Please don't mind that I read in silence yet absolutely benefit from all of your strengths. I do understand having demons and anger. The looping scenes repeated in my head, smells, sights, waking up screaming...just that my memories have a different source. I feel validated today for the first time in a long time. Saner than I have in a long time. Most importantly I feel compassion for myself. Something I have been denying myself.   A million thanks. I will continue to read in silence."

Said my need to express is scaring people during this thing.  Making them worry.  Then I freaked out on the an AD comment.  She's right.    The appropriate place is not in front of the public.  I even re read mail to AM and it was scattered, incoherent babbling.  God, why did I nee you guys and right freaking after finding some guys that saw my crack up, guys that didn't even care I was just an engineer, you guys are freakin cool.  I freaks them. And there is another thing to beat me up with.   a freak, I am a glutton for punishment.  Apparently no body has ever kicked my ass like ME.  This morning I'm depressed where before was more level.  Raghhhh.  Yester day I wanted to the joker thing.  But when I crackup its not normal.  One of my heros.  Dude named John Ringo.  Wrote a series with David Weber.  The last book was ""we few"" and for me, a tear jerker.  There was a character in a scene.  A joker.  The guy that, when stressed, cracks jokes.  Everyone around him knew he was bat shit crazy.  But he was there.  No matter how scared he did his job.  He didn't get much of a part.  There were shiney characters that deserved much more than he.  He just helped rescue the protagonists old lady.  Never in front of the heros, always just behind, or amongst.  Never really out front.  I identified with him  I'm that guy.  Not much of a part, just a bit.  Get stressed and the bad jokes start flying.  When you boys smack me, I'd turn into the child, talking only through this exagerated body language to ensure you lions wont eat me and ensure you think I'm harm Less.  Lack of personal standards.  I imitate them.  A also wanted attention so badly I would do this slpstick thing and make a fool to entertain you.  I remember. I was in Bahgram, some idiot general needed his English washer and dryer adapted for metric.  Can you believe this? 19 days in bagram waiting on parts for some spoiled brass.  I needed like  1/2"" to 10mm adapter.  Sgt. Pigpen was TDdY to Baghram because some General needed to get his American Standard washer and dryer hooked up to that Metric crap.    (yes I went there.  I dare you to argue.  I'll beat you with discreet math, machine learning, and pattern recognition... till you bleed).   Metric is for sheep.  Base 2 rules.  üòÅ  I mean, I was down in Khandahar.  Regardless, the is set in Bagrahm.    While awaiting an English metric adapter, the old ""1/2"" by 10 mm bushing, I received a most urgent order from command.  I cannot give you the exact details as they were top secret.   As usual this need to know crap is getting on my nerves.    I ask ""WHERE are you sending me?""  For the thousandth time this deployment I here this sarcastic comeback ""if we tell you, we gotta kill you"" followed by ""Just get your shit and get ON the flight line.""  I am dumbfounded.  After a very long pause, I asked ""What flight?"".  He responded ""It doesn't say, it says they are coming to get you?""  I remember thinking ""WHO?"" But after a small hesitation, I reached down and grabbed my shit.  The orders specified no tools as this was a leader recon.  I had bare minimum, ruck, and cold weather gear and sleeping bag.  I remember waiting and wait III Ng go for what seemed like hours.  Flight were incoming and outbound.  Blech.  And no one came for me.  I figured they forgot.  Who the fuck is coming get me?  Holy shit.  A blacked Chinook lands that has got to be coolest thing I have ever seen."".  Obviously it was not for me.  I gazed at this beauty of a Chinook.  The sun was behind a big ass mountain and it got COLD.  WTF?  Grizzy Adams and Gentle Ben got out.  What the fuck is this?  It's getting dark, I pull my field jacket tighter, and watch two of the biggest SOF guys I have ever seen marching with purpose, lock stepped, straight for the building I am in back of.  I remember thinking I like their style.  Purpose.  Fucking Grizzy Adams looks at me and angled towards me, like a fucking shark or barracuda cutting something from the heard.  They came straight up to me and fucking stopped.  I'm in awe.  A giant of a man, I'm calling gentle Ben cause I don't want my ass kicked and look at this? It's mother fucking Grizzly Adams. Fucking full beard and shit. He looks me dead in the eye and he asks ""You PigPen?""  No rank?  I'm unsure, I respond ""Yes Sir.""  He says get on the bird?  And gentle ben takes me over, sets me down, locks my gear down, an gone.  They do the ground crew thing.  By my self.  On a blacked out Chinook.  With grizzly Adams and gentle Ben... Until OGA shows.  He had the look.  Yeah you know the one.  Tricked out M16 with infra red, laser, rails, scope.  I compared his lady to Betsy after he sat down accross from me.  Betsy came out second to this sharp A4 that probably radar an lidar for all I know.  I looked at him.  He stared.  I smiled. He just stared.  Fuck him, OGA don't know me very well.  I go into childlike mode.  Curiosity, looking at everthing and ensuring his sharp ass sees.  Yeah.  Make myself look idiotic.  Make OGA laugh.  He was tough.  I mean tough.  Worst audience of one I ever had.  Be the man huh?  Hmm.  So now I'm in full childlike curiosty mode even to the point of exagerating postures and slumps and such.  Damn, not even a fucking grin.  Nothing.  Blank wall.  Hmmmm.  Tough audience.  I go puppy dog on him.  So, if any of you have ever been scared?  Pulling out at dusk is scary.  That's when a mother fucking hadji is waiting with an RPG for sgt pigpen and his top secret mission.  If I'm going to die, I want to see it coming.  Fuck it.  Am at the bubble widow, portraying little kid for OGA and he's blank.  Nothing.  Now I'm scared a little and the joker comes out bad.  Cackling mad hatter laughs.  Talking to myself ensuring I communicate effectively with my body language, I'm all up in the bubble.  Did you know they test fire that great big ass gun everytime they leave?  Me either.  So there I am in full joker mode, exagerating everything like male drama queen... And that damn gunner fucking test fires a goddamn battling gun right in my ear. While but hole.puckers, I leap into air, spinning around I midair so I can present face to OGA.   the dragons breath shooting away from the side of my ride. still concious enough of my audience to perform.  As I land I am checking out OGA, my only audience.  He smiled at me.  He had to stop that fucking gufaw he almost let out.  He locked it down quickly, put back on his wall, and stared through me and into the distance.  I made him smile.  I can't help it.  It's what I do.  He fucking knew he needed it.  I wagged my tail for him without saying a word.  I wasn't scared of him.  He was capable.  Even grungy like me.  They dropped OGA off in middle of nowhere.  He left strapping his sniper rifle on a departed into the night.  As he walked away, he gave a nod and I never saw him again.  Impressive he was.  That one smile I got from him was worth a lot.  Sure I had to wag.  But how do you show him you care?  Make fool of yourself. This behavior learned in childhood gives a man problems.  I have to lay low till they get me locked down or ill freak people out.  I doubt that many people can handle me.  Anyway.  I will implement a process to restrain myself till some sane person like Mrs Mandy says its ok."
MilitaryStories,2wwx38,Dittybopper,3,Thu Mar 5 13:02:23 2015 UTC,"Morning Rave (got another name I can use? Make something up.)  Tired, depressed, got your babble box on. Okay, you have been putting out some effort lately, that has to take a toll, hence, you're wore out for the time being. Normal. Depression sucks, the only way I have found to deal effectively with it is to be absolutely sure to take care of myself by eating well, getting my sleep and telling myself ""This too, will pass."" And it will, hang tight. Eat well today, eat at least one full meal, otherwise eat when you're hungry,  keep some nutrition in you and keep hydrated (very important). Take a nap today, hell take two or three if it helps. Just find a place to dose for a few minutes - you're in recovery mode today, get past this, build some reserve for coming interaction with the monolith that is the VA.   tl:dr: Get through this ONE day, take care of number one. Do yourself that one service.  I think everything in Europe can be taken apart with a 10mm box-end wrench. I used to own VW Jetta's and a 10 mil was about all you needed to take stuff apart on it. Your Bagram story was interesting, when you are able perhaps you can flesh it out and post it to /r/MilitaryStories. I believe the readership would be interested.  This habit of yours of attempting to turn folks into ""hero's"" or surrogate dad's needs examining. Take that up with the head doc's. Just a layman's opinion mind you.

MilitaryStories,2wwx38,RantNRave31,2,Thu Mar 5 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"""getting my blab on"" is so appropriate.  LMAO I had fun writing this last night.  Fun.  I reread your comment during another brief moment of clarity while eating.  ""A moment of clarity?  How long will it last?"" You ask yourself.  ""I do not not know"" I reply.    ""Pick a new name"" you said earlier DittyBopper, in the above comment.  I want a new name now.  ""Huh?"" You might think.  I add a random thought from earlier ""Jesus Christ!  My very fucking name is a sick cry!"", as the humorous epiphany that hit me while REREADING your words pops back to light.  I explain needlessly that ""The more iterations I do, The more I get it.""  Rant ""smack WTF?""  I interject before I can even finish a thought.  ""DittyBopper, WTF have you DONE to me?  Some Jedi mind trick you learn from master Yoda, AM?"" I think to myself.  Now that I know you and AM have mastered the dark side; I recognize that I am but a student and have stumbled into a whole temple full of jedi masters and such.   I apologize with ""excuse the poor star wars analogy/joke.""  I describe my feelings right now as ""a drunk stumbles into church with a duck under his arm""  thinking he's in a bar and jokes will be appropriate.  I now have strange thoughts as follows:   Are curse words best used in double quotes?  Is it less offensive? Can I USE double quotes?  Is it possible to have fun with a double quote?  Would I make more sense using double quotes?  And... Might it be fun?  How many ways are there to use a double quote?  I realize that I have not used the double quote for years except in string declaration.  The programmer in me deprecated them as useless garbage; as the use of the double quote in a string requires a backslash to implement in between the enclosing double quotes.   I think ""run on"" and suddenly cringe at my own grammar.  Could repeated attempts and effort towards correct grammar, training, help a person think more correctly?  Could I infer  correct speaking would follow?  Then might people ""under stand the words that are coming out of my mouth?  Can the attempt?  The ""try"", the effort, reduce racing thoughts?  This is interesting and somehow seems familiar.  Did I know or read this before?  End Rant* ""And now back to the regularly scheduled program."" - unknown  Weird.  Earlier this evening, you effectively ""put me to bed"" in a most pleasant mood. Instead of ignoring orders or advice this time I was clear enough that  I caught it.  It called me down.  Not worrying and  Rest sounded good to me.  Rest.  ""who of you by worrying can add one minute to your life"" dude said. üòâ. You, DittyBopper, hit the nail on the HEAD.  I was and still am, caught in that.  I'm not embarrassed for a change.  I, am writing this while freshly showered and having finished eating a Renegade 12oz Sirloin with this parmesan crusted toping sort of oozing over the sides.  Medium well.  I know.  I now write this offline, as  ""This can wait till morning"" is a thought I have not had in ages.  Interesting.   Your advice?  ""Meal...Rest.""    Rest and Relaxation is exactly where I wish to be DittyBopper.  Till my amended DD-214 comes in, I suddenly realize I can make it.  Not scared.  Freaking out.  Calm sometimes and for short periods, I now wish a new name.  SGT pigpen is too much the ""self fulfilling prophecy"" now that I can actually understand what you meant.  I surely should not pick now right?  I mean, after VA when I trust my judgement more?  Some sort of name for where I want to be that is peaceful but funny, friendly and a bit proud for WHEN they get me my mojo back.  Cocky like I was.  Too smart for my own good.  Something with ""mother fucking TEETH."" And a touch of crazy.  But a service and support guy. Damn. Rant.  The guys at the plant used to call me ""turbo"" as my radio handle.  I used to joke ""surely not from working fast."". It was because back then I was devouring ""Turbo Pascal"" in between latent heat of condensation and vaporization classes,  they kind of mocked me for always finishing first.  Good class.  I can teach refrigeration too.  Manufactured KLEA 134a back then.  And... Also, for talking waaaay to fast at constant velocity, of course.  I bet you guessed that.  Crack pot Einstein or the architect are both Too grandiose.  Crazy8?  8 ball.  Hmmm.  Some chick I hung out with nicked me with ""weird Harold"" from fat Albert.  But again.  Self deprecating.  But I liked it. They were cute.  My brothers from another mother called me ""vanilla Gump."". That was funny.  Mom... M momma says ""Ice Ice baby"" üòâ  they get me.  It was appropriate then.  A small part is reminded of the daddy thing, and thinks ""sick puppy"" would be appropriate.  I don't want to be that!  Ass kissers, grovelers, and fans disgust me.  I WAS looking for a surrogate dad.   Sick!!!!!  Aww Jesus.  I miss my Dad too.  You busted me down and now I agree.  ""Sick"".  It would absolutely freak me out if someone puppy dogged me.  ""Gross!"" I think out loud.   I have to admit that to counsel.  Another damn rant.  Sorry.  How did you not run screaming in fear?  Have I really done that?  The honest answer is... Yes. And  It makes my skin crawl.  I will attempt to slip no farther and instead, move forward.  I choose to wait for advice, clarity, and inspiration.  I'll end with the following attemt at humor:  Damn dude. Just WTF were your ASVAB scores?  I've only met a few guys that I had access to 201 for , that whooped me.  Suddenly, I am nervous.  It would be so horrible to wake up from this and realize I am in room with a bunch of literal ""smart asses"" where my scores were only average or below average.  Even worse, the thought of waking up and recognizing people.  I have warning bells going off in my head for a WEEK.  The kind I have been ignoring for ... Two years since I really snapped.  I end with the thought, ""Oh shit."" And in the best Elvis impression I have, I say ""Thank you, Thank you very much.""  Next step, MOVE!"

We don't do it until the test fire is complete in case a weapon has a malfunction necessitating returning to the COP where we'd just have to clear them.   Did you cat's actually have to get out and clear into barrels?  'Cause that's what I'm inferring from the way you put it.  Jesus-fuck-it-all of you did.  Apparently I was lucky.   The temperature inside the truck steadily climbs as most of them no longer have working A/C, the ones that do are nearly guaranteed to get blown up.   I laughed at your misery.  Sorry.  All of ours (gun-trucks anyway, and I was never in anything else) had DUKES, so they were deadlined if the AC didn't work.  Damn, dude.  I know I said it before, and I guess it's the shared experience, but I'm right there with you.  I can feel the tension on those steep sided roads, the boredom of interrogation, the ""nobody is out.  Goddammit.  When are we getting hit?""  Being hungry.  You remind me of those little things I've momentarily misplaced, like the chevron in an ACOG and the bit of tape damping its brightness.  I like the style of your telling of this story."
MilitaryStories,2wwx38,SoThereIwas-NoShit,8,Tue Feb 24 03:40:48 2015 UTC,"We didn't use clearing barrels, just didn't walk around with one in the chamber inside the wire. Became the policy after some REMFs from the Support Company killed themselves and their buddies by not clearing their damn weapons before cleaning them.  We had DUKES as well, but this was years later, so they could function without AC by that time. It became a jinx to ride in a brand new truck or truck with AC.....or with our FO Warren in it, who you'll note is in my truck on this mission. If a truck was to be hit, it'd be one of those. Warren had a streak going by the end of the deployment, a perfect 13/13 trucks destroyed that he rode in, not all with him in it but he as least rode out there in it."

MilitaryStories,2wwx38,Shpadoinkles,7,Tue Feb 24 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"It was pretty nasty. One guy had a round chambered and hit it with a cleaning rod, went off, through the wall of his B-hut and killed his lieutenant who was walking by outside, had another guy shoot himself in the face, etc.   Just people being fucking stupid with weapons. During the fighting season we'd still walk around with hot weapons, but during the winter we decided to play nice since we were getting increasing brass attention due to our area being batshit insane."

Some boys are going to Rambo even in the rear with the gear and us engineers.  They just ""have"" to have a round in the chamber.  To much of boy to clear his weapon.  He enters the px.  Leans his weapon against the wall as he gazes longingly at some item not seen since stateside.  Yeah.  Weapon falls over in the px.  AD accidental discharge is the scariest sound on the planet.

And yes, the DS pointedly said he doesn't give a shit if you live 400 yards off post (like Pvt Shitbird).  Do not drive a POV, full stop.  Here comes our suave, sophisticated handsome young recruit.  Shiny civvy clothes after months of Basic and AIT.  The first Brown Round to see him is flabbergasted.  Young Soldier has made it all of 30 yards from the parking lot before running into him.  The DS can't believe his eyes.  Watch him yell back into the Orderly Room for assistance, SURELY this young soldier hasn't been able to fuck up THIS quickly.  Rest assured readers!  The rest of the B co 143rd cadre were more then happy to render professional assistance in assuring the initial Drill that, ""HOLY SHIT, he really did fuck up that quickly!""  The DS feeding frenzy that erupted was amazing.  Front back go's, mountain climbers, push-ups, ""Get over here Private!"" ""What the fuck, I wasn't done with you, get back over here!  Don't listen to him, I'm the Drill Sergeant talking to you.""  UP! DOWN!  Roll left!  Roll right!  GO!  The entire barracks, all three floors watched, peeking from the edge of the window lest we be caught watching and be asked to participate.  We all finished our prep and quietly exfil'd via the back and side doors.  Sprinting around and hopefully out of sight.  Blood was in the air and woe unto you who did not avoid.

The big joke was to find some oblivious mark and fill his rucksack with rocks, add a couple of five or twenty pounds of weight to the thirty-five pound minimum.  Rucks got weighed after the march/run, because a smart man will have his weight above standard and ditch it at the first opportunity so that he's light as an angel with nothing but a sleeping bag making his burden look big.  At some point somebody took the dumping rocks into rucks to the next level, and found a huge fifteen or twenty pound mini-boulder.  It was obvious to the guy rucking it that he was much heavier, and that rock ended up being a godamned Platoon Rock that we took everywhere, and actually became an unofficial inventory item.  It became a point of pride to hump the Platoon Rock, until somebody finally got pissed off and chucked it into the woodline or wherever.  It definitely had a few jumps under its belt, though.

Your family wanted to hear from you, but sometimes frankly you didn't want to hear from them. No honey, I don't care about your bad day at work because frankly, today we got blown the fuck up and I have a concussion.

I think one of our Companies was up that way, out of there.  Now I'm trying to think of names of places, but I fucking brain dumped when I got out.  We only got out of our AO a couple of times, so the rest of the country could be on the other side of the world and it'd make just as much sense.  Christ, I'm trying to think of the name of the FOB.

Good lead in with this first part, looking forward to your next posts. I imagine life on a COP to be pretty analogous to a Fire Support Base in VN. Generally the arty guys were on FSB's alone with a company of infantry. The infantry ran ops out of the bases, would deploy by foot or chopper and run sweeps under the cover of the artillery, 81's, 40-duce and 105mm guns.   Letters were the main line of commo to the home front, some people had access to MARS stations which were SSB shortwave networks that could connect to the US. I never did manage to call home via that network, but I did phone home from Malaysia when I was on R&R. Dad was in-country, up in I Corps, me down in III and IV Corps, he visited once, flew down space available and spent like two days with me."

MilitaryStories,2wdszo,All_Secure,22,Sun Feb 22 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Good story, OP. It's funny, what interested me was the credentials-check between your GrandDad and the DI. If it had been some suit on his way to an air-conditioned office who tweaked the young boot about ""playing soldier,"" you know the DI's reaction would've been different.   My guess is that the DI would have treated the driver's conduct with professionalism and a dismissive, polite contempt. If the driver pushed it, he'd be lucky if the DI restrained himself to a dose of Kipling: Making mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep, is CHEAPER, than those uniforms. And they're starvation cheap.   I'm of an age and disposition that I look like an old hippie. We live and work in a town surrounded by military bases - lots of people training. I hear enough young soldiers and airmen practicing getting their war-face on. It's an ancient ritual, and really does no harm. Can be funny. Sometimes it will make an old man smile.  But when it is funny, I try to have a credential somewhere they can see it, and the civilians won't notice. I wear a 1st Cav pin on my hat, when I'm wearing a hat, or like your GrandDad, I will mention Vietnam in passing.   You witnessed a thing as old as the military, OP. A kid training on the Fields of Mars, complains to his primus pilus that some lame old geezer made fun of his wooden sword. You gotta give the DI some ammunition to train 'em up: ""That old geezer was a centurion at Zama with Scipio Africanus, pup. He can say anything he wants about your sword.""  And so it goes. Your turn soon enough, OP.   ~  Edit Thanks for the gold. Should be more gold thrown around this subreddit. I know it means nothing, but it's also a guide. I'm grateful for anyone else's footprint when I'm navigating a minefield of comments - I ain't proud.  Even so, I think we can do without the obligatory ""Edit Thanks for the gold,"" and I would've refrained except that upon returning to this post I noticed I had promoted OP's Grandpa to his Dad, mostly because I can't believe how long it's been since My Own Private Zama.

The country is beautiful in places, the people warm but I have difficulty even hearing the language spoken, it gives me the heeby jeebys.

I sat myself down yesterday, turned on the classical music mix on my iPod, and re-read parts one through five. My god. Soul crushing detail about a trip into futility - half Kafka, half Conrad's riverboat sailing upstream into the Heart of Darkness. There was a lot of Beethoven in the background, but not ""Ode to Joy.""  Road clearing? Are you kidding me? A fucking convoy? You CAN'T ""clear"" a road! Didn't we learn that on Highway 9 out to Khe Sanh? I was yelling a lot, trying to get you some helicopters.  And on to part six. Contact! Wasn't expecting that.   Confusion in simplicity. Everyone trying to prioritize and cut through to the one job they had, even if it was several jobs...Cut everything down to the simplicity of necessity.   The secret to performing under fire is to have something to DO. Things would go BANG!, and I'd be reaching for my radio, map and compass. I always had a plan, because once, when I had no immediate task to do other than not get killed, I hovered in the door of a bunker feeling like a malingering coward. Feeling like that once was plenty. Parts one through five reminded me of that - how you keep monitoring yourself, planning a next move if things go south, remembering your training.   It always seems that the joy of these situations is always left out. Maybe because it's impossible to describe. [emphasis added] I've never felt so alive, so fully in control of nothing and everything at once. I've never felt so godamned good. Maybe it's having that one task, that one purpose in life, possibly for the rest of your life, but nothing matters except doing that one thing as well as you can. I don't know.   True straight through to the heart of the matter. There is a purity of purpose, a coalescing of everything you are... A door opens in front of you. This is the last thing you will do in your life. Make it count. Do it right. Be beautiful. Blow it up. Make it hurt. Let 'em know you were here.  This is eerily good writing. Plus, just as I was reading the quoted part, the music shifted to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. How'd you do dat? Some psyops godling was reading along with me.  Grinder, I believe this is the best thing you've written yet. Your only enemy now is an editor. Keep it raw, however you can. Bring the bodies out here. I've got plenty of land - nobody will find them. And besides, editors... who would even look?  Good stuff. Thanks man. That couldn't have been an easy write."

Not rotary wing aircraft, anyway.  Remember, Orgun-e was 7500' above sea level.  Tillman was probably 8 or 9000.  Weather was a huge factor, too.  When I got back from mid-tour leave flights were getting grounded over to Boris/Bermel, and when I finally did get on a CH-47, even it flew through passes rather than over them.  So there's that.  And no, you can't clear a road.  Like I said somewhere in some post here, it was a Sisyphean task.  There was too much country and not enough of us, but the ground was how we got around, mostly.   Contact! Wasn't expecting that.   We were all of us praying for it, sorta in a sick way, because we wanted some fucking payback.  I don't like violence, because I know how much I can like it, but (and you know this better than me I'm sure) at a certain point there isn't a thing in the world you want more than to make widows and orphans and grieving parents.   A door opens in front of you. This is the last thing you will do in your life. Make it count. Do it right. Be beautiful. Blow it up. Make it hurt. Let 'em know you were here.   That's what I meant to say.   Har har har.  I like the way you put it.  Can you be my ghost-writer?  I fucking love Apocalypse Now.  The part about it that cracks me up is everybody thinks it's a War movie, but it isn't.  I've always seen it as a movie about madness and insanity, with Vietnam as the backdrop.

After that day I made sure to take a closer look at the rank insignias   Off topic, but I knew a Col like that when I was deployed to Balad. I got kidnapped for chow A LOT. Where I worked, we didn't have time and too many people to sit and eat so it was always ""get it and go"". Not a big deal, as we also had an MWR drive filled with music and movies, so that was nice. However, if this Col spotted me, or anyone else under his command that he knew, you were told to ""sit and eat"". He was a really awesome leader and went out of his way to try and help his troops."

Step off the sidewalk to fix a bloused pant leg that came undone. As soon as I do, who other than the battalion Sergeant Major to walk by and ask why the fuck I'm in the grass.  First week at first duty station, take a shortcut from the sidewalk through a mostly-gravel area to get to our shoppette. Apparently there were a few blades of grass in that gravel lot that warranted the ass chewing I got from a Sergeant First Class who happened to be walking by.  And finally, Fort Bragg.

There were always signs saying, DO NOT WALK ON GRASS.  BY ORDER OF CSM, staked into the pathetic excuse for grass that those units were trying to grow in the dead North Carolina sand.

One day, I got curious and asked out E-6 instructor why we never got to play with the Marines. He said, word for word, ""Marines have their own sandbox, they dont play well with the other kids."" - Me and the other 13 in the class (including the Navy) started laughing so hard, it attracted the NCOIC (E-7) who was walking buy.

MilitaryStories,2w2g9f,Dittybopper,14,Mon Feb 16 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"While in the service (army) my interactions with other services was rather limited with one exception, at Operations we had guys from all branches. Well, except coasties, I think, I couldn't distinguish a coastie from a navy if my life depended upon it.  Once, while on a tear down in the vil, Yomitan, Okinawa, one evening I had an encounter with a very drunk Marine wherein I was threatened to have my eyes removed in a most horrible fashion, however his buddies dragged him off before the deed was done. So no fun that evening. If, on the other hand, you were looking for a fight all you had to do is head down to the village the Marines hung out in and you were positively guaranteed one. We had been warned by our command to avoid that village.  At Operations on Torii Station where I worked, and across the hall from we army Morse interceptors were three intercept rooms (bays) staffed with navy and Marine Morse Intercept Operators. In contrast to us those guys were laid back beyond all reason, in our eyes. We army types were kept busy as bee's with meeting our intercept targets who were on the air quite a bit; whereas the fellow manning those navy and marine bays were seen to mostly read paperback novels while sitting their positions, leaned back in their chairs, headsets around their necks and reading zombie like. If my Room Supervisor had caught me reading a novel while sitting position I would have been skinned. Every now and again one of them, a navy or marine, would leisurely position his headsets for copying, tune his receivers and copy some ""Duck"" (a very loud and clear Morse signal) for a few minutes then pick up his book and go dormant again. We never copied ducks, all our shit was weak signaled and buried in other shortwave signals, we had to mine that shit out of the airwaves. We envied them their relaxed pace, ducky signals, and infrequent intercept schedules (skeds). They almost never interacted with us, they were there, as were we, but the two were apart, most especially the Marines who held themselves aloof. I worked a year and a half across the hall from those guys and might have exchanged two words with them. Oil on water.  And this apartness held back at the barracks too, all the intercept types were housed in this single three story building on base, the navy and marines had their own areas within the barracks. It brought a smile and a self satisfied ""fuck that shit"" grin to my face to see the marines playing Marine each week out in front of the barracks, they always had a Saturday inspection, full junk on the bunk style, we army types on Torii Station had about one a year just to ensure that we hadn't (yet) traded our combat issue for booze I guess. The marines also held formation before marching down to Ops each day, they could be seen regularly doing PT and running in formation, we never did that shit.   So, the Marines had it easy pleasy at Ops but played Marine to the hilt otherwise while we army worked our tails of at Ops and could slack off otherwise.   Good story OP, thanks for bringing it."

Having been both Active (one of those 82nd Assholes) and National Guard later, I became a very confused individual.  The All American part of me felt like I was slumming it, and looked upon other NG with an AA combat patch as undeserving posers riding the coattails of America's Guard of Honor.  Then, though, the National Guard part of me looked at the 509th PIR guys we worked for and thought, ""Jesus, what a bunch of cocky dipshits!""  I can only imagine how bad it was for our ""former"" Marines, who would always let you know that yes, they had once been Marines, and in the Corps they didn't do things this way.  Getting saluted for a sham-shield!  Awesome!  They get so damned stuck up about rank, not that the Army doesn't, but I've always found the difference between Army and Marines hilarious.

I'm thinking super-Gunny here, but I'll leave it to the Marines to set me straight. No fucks to give, though - right?  Fifteen years ago we tried to get the neighbors together to do something about the local population of feral cats. About half the crowd was nodding at our proposed, humane idea of dealing with wild cats, and half the crowd decided that we were inhuman monsters who did not wove the poooooor kitties. Did we not have internet? Did we not know how wonderful ALL kitties are? ALL KITTIES!! No talking! Everyone who disagrees must be punished! Exiled! JAILED!! KITTIES!!!!   We got out of there before they could crochet a couple of nooses. Everyone who might have agreed with us ducked and covered. No one ever raised the subject again.  So bless the Master Gunnery Sergeant. Like all true Marines, he went straight at the fanatic army of gibbering, slavering, drooling kitty-zombies. Semper Fi, Gunny. I didn't have the nerve.   ""Confirmed kills."" Yeah, I think the term you're looking for is ""step-ons."" Bet he did just that, too."
MilitaryStories,2vny37,AnathemaMaranatha,9,Thu Feb 12 22:55:51 2015 UTC,"Ya know, I'm a big cat lover. I actually spent a night in jail for beating the shit out of a guy who kicked a cat. That said, I've shot feral cats, allowed my own tom cats to be shot when causing problems, and would have little issue with rounding up and euthanizing or sterilizing feral cats. They are detrimental to local wildlife, cause property damage, are threats to domestic animals, and generally cause enough problems that domestic animals become a target of those trying to eliminate the feral cat problem.   That doesn't mean I condone acts of violence for the sake of violence. Euthanize them humanely, if you have to shoot them make sure it's a kill, and make sure your own pets are fixed and not part of the problem. It sounds like master guns was just a piece of shit who like killing animals for fun. That's not inside the head of a Marine, it's inside the head of a fucked up asshole.

I feel sorry for cats who are let loose to roam the neighborhood by irresponsible, self-righteous owners who believe that cats should be free and everyone should just suck up the spray and cat-fights.   You might be right about the Master Gunnery Sergeant. Then again, maybe he was doing cats instead of the animals that really deserved it - the owners. Y'know, you stay in the boonies long enough, you get so bush-happy that the idea that you can't run over people like that sounds right, but you just can't remember why. So cats.

MilitaryStories,2vny37,yeah_yup_yeah,3,Mon Feb 16 02:56:37 2015 UTC,"I was only an NCO for about 6 months. Never served as one. This is my observation of both the Army and Marines.  When I was in, eventual promotion up through E-6 was pretty much guaranteed, if there was a slot for you and if you didn't fuck up when someone was watching. There was a war going on, so lots of slots.   At E7 things got trickier. Even so, steady, good performance, with no bad marks guaranteed promotion. The Army, at least, was short of E7s, so again, plenty of slots.  After E7, NCO promotion was highly political. Good work and steady reliable service were marginal issues. There was much backslapping and ass kissing going on for those who wanted the promotion. There was a lot of backstabbing involved too. The system seemed to favor ruthless, ambitious asshats who were not above kissing few butts and stabbing a few backs.   Not all of them. Some good guys made it through even to the SM ranks. But there was a high percentage of people you wouldn't trust in a pinch.  My observation was that the rest of the good guys just opted out of the game at E7 and waited out their twenty. Didn't want to be that guy.   Same for officers. When I was in, O5 to O6 was brutal. O6 to O7 was a knifefight. After that, it was Borgias all the way up."

As a Noncommissioned Officer, I realize that I am a member of a time honored corps, which is known as ‚ÄúThe Backbone of the Army.‚Äù I am proud of the Corps of Noncommissioned Officers, and will at all times conduct myself so as to bring credit upon the Corps, the military service, and my country; regardless of the situation in which I find myself.

My two basic responsibilities will always be uppermost in my mind: The accomplishment of my mission and the welfare of my Soldiers. I will strive to remain technically and tactically proficient. I am aware of my role as a Noncommissioned Officer, I will fulfill my responsibilities inherent in that role. All Soldiers are entitled to outstanding leadership; I will provide that leadership. I know my Soldiers, and I will always place their needs above my own. I will communicate consistently with my Soldiers, and never leave them uninformed. I will be fair and impartial when recommending both rewards and punishment.  Officers of my unit will have maximum time to accomplish their duties; they will not have to accomplish mine. I will earn their respect and confidence as well as that of my Soldiers. I will be loyal to those with whom I serve; seniors, peers, and subordinates alike.

MilitaryStories,2vcqoa,seewolfmdk,6,Tue Feb 10 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"Civics and Basic Training. Bringing back a tradition of the Campus Martius after 2000 years of Basic Training without context - only a demand for unquestioned allegiance to the Emperor, the Prophet, the Christ, the Pope, the King, the Constitution.   Two hundred thirty-nine years ago this side of the Atlantic we learned the value of a citizen soldier, forgotten worldwide since the Swiss demonstrated that value so well they were paid to become the exact opposite thing - mercenaries. It's a fine idea that seems to appear at unexpected moments in unexpected places. Finland. Germany. Good for you. Some of us on this side of the ocean are taking notes."
MilitaryStories,2vcqoa,cbrdude,6,Tue Feb 10 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"I think the moment wasn't that unexpected. After World War II there was a need to form a military that was ""different"" than the Wehrmacht. The plan was to have soldiers who didn't just executed orders. They were expected to think about the orders they executed. Are they legit? Are they opposing democratic values of the Republic?  In modern armies these abilities are common because of the better general education. But it was bit change back then."

It only has one line of dialogue... but delivered emotively, so true-to-life, so effectively, with such a consummate actor's understanding of the context and situational milieu that Stanislavski and I were almost-involuntarily moved to laughter. LOL. Bravo.   ""Oooow!"" I hear that. Way back in the bad old days, our light infantry company was paired up with a company from the 11th ACR. We swapped platoons - they got platoon of dismountable infantry, and we got... We got a platoon of great, honking, clanging noisy machines. We were a silent company. It was NOT a good match.  The M113s had the same .50 cal mount from your video, and I was sitting right behind it - that view is what triggered this story-bomb. M113s were troop carriers that were not allowed to actually carry troops because mines - also because the entire lower deck of the M113 was made of metal ammo boxes, kept there as mine enhancers, I guess.  Anyway, we had to ride on top as the ACR people crashed through the jungle. Our track commander had a belt around the turret. He had hooked a sensible number of frags and smoke grenades on it, but also a suspicious amount of insect spray.  So about five or six of us were hanging on to each track as they lurched and banged their way through the jungle. Our first clue was when a five-foot bamboo viper hit the upper deck - stunned, thank God. The track commander pulled a snake-stick out of his turret and tossed it into the jungle. Then he stopped and yelled at the grunts who had bailed off the top of the track. They reluctantly re-mounted.   Not long afterward we were moving through bamboo, hit a hole, lurched around and thrashed the bamboo all over the top of the track. Everyone hung on for dear life, and then everyone had to run away. Fire ants. All of them.  I was, like all the airmobile infantry, on the blessed ground pulling off everything I owned and shaking ants out of it. The track commander stopped his track and began to spray everything - himself included - with DDT or whatever, and at the same time cursing the pussy light infantry that dismounted off his stupid, smelly, noisy deathtrap without orders just because of a few ants.  Words were exchanged. For the rest of the week, the ACR people ignored us, and we ignored them.   I broke up with tracks that day. Thanks for reminding me why, OP.

That was an armored cav troop from the 9th ID. We went red-lights-and-siren everywhere we went. No choice in the matter - big noisy, clanking, roaring M113s and M48 tanks. Everyone in the fishing villes could hear us coming miles away - time enough to hide all the wounded NVA and other contraband. We hardly ever surprised anyone - which made for peaceful patrolling.   Peaceful for us, anyway. I can imagine life in the villes: Pack it up! Here they come! Get all the wounded in the tunnels! Stow those med kits under the fishing boats! What? They went right past us? <sigh> Okay, get the wounded out of the tunnels and tell the docs to go back to work. What do you MEAN they're coming back? Fuck those guys! Don't they EVER just settle down?

This was taken at our base camp at Utah Beach - surf and sand and within bullet range of the famous Rue sans Joie.

Hatch is open on the M113. .50 cal turret is up behind me, M-60s mounted up on the top deck behind me on the left and on the right. The one on the left was mine. We were the command track, so I guess they figured it didn't matter much if one M-60 sat idle while I fiddled with the artillery on the radio. I got to shoot it when I wasn't busy.

MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,SoThereIwas-NoShit,15,Sun Feb 1 23:16:56 2015 UTC,"Level down.  There was a part of Dark called ""The Firmament"" where I let my mind drift away from light and noise and the confused sensory input of war, and drift down into darkness. There was a lot of shit going on there. I remember feeling bigger, deeper the next day, as if I had explored the basement of where I was living, that I understood better the depth of where I was, how I was living in one corner of one room of a vast mansion.  OP, you spent years being being tossed and bouncing around like a racketball in an invisible court - unexpected corners, ricochets, turns, skids and stops. You were there, the wall, the floor was there, there was an interaction and you became entangled with the places you struck, the places that struck you, like quantum particles.   Now it's time to revisit those spaces that are still entangled with a piece of you. Occupy them. They are part of you. Go to the bottom of it, get a view, figure out how to re-touch and claim everything that touched you.  Level up.  You can't touch bottom. You need to go deep enough that you finally realize that it goes on forever, that you hang in space over a microcosm of you that recedes like stacked turtles, all the way down. Then back up. Back up into the noise and weather and sand and impacts and explosions and skies full of of lethal light. Not bouncing any more. Touch every place that touched you. Make it yours. That is who you are now.  I didn't do that. I let the people around me - people I loved and trusted - convince me that the things I had seen and done, things that had seen me and done to me, were too alien. They couldn't be a part of my new, respectable, predictable life. Forget them. Leave them behind.  Can't. Those things are forever part of you. You cannot live, and not live those things. Down to silence, up to chaos and war, out to the high silence of the desert sky, it's all you. I tried to sever myself from those things - it was my duty to move onto a new, lucrative, credentialed life where none of those things were welcome or understood. Damn near killed me.  Level off.  Writing helps. You're writing now - and so am I, decades late. You're  instincts are good. Writing helps you own it.   Remember it all - it won't ever forget you - it will come and get you if you pretend to forget. Live it all, from silence so deep that you can hear the pulse in your ear, to noise so loud and light so bright that it seems a wonder it didn't shred you on the spot. Turns out it did just that, not enough to kill you, but enough to change you forever. You can't go back. You can't be what you were.   Who would want that? You are deeper, taller, brighter, darker, weaker, stronger, more alive, nearer death, more true, more sure than you could have ever been staying at home and doing the expected thing. You are alarming to people around you. They will ask you to tone it down. Fuck that. Tone it UP. Woo!"

MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,snimrass,7,Mon Feb 2 01:10:11 2015 UTC,"Nope. Can't take the silence. The ringing in my ears bugs me.   I'll take the stillness and peace that you get when humans aren't around so much. Silence lets my brain roam around too much.  After spending a while on the ship, you get used to the sounds of it - the white noise of ventilation and exhausts and engines, mixed in with all the noise of people living and working in such close confines. Changes in machinery noise tell you what is going on - boat davits, engines revving up, ventilation cutting out, main broadcast cutting in. All mean something. Normally mean that I have to wake up, too.  And then I get home. And try to sleep in the quiet. And I just can't. It's worse trying to get used to all the sounds of nature again - bats can sound downright freaky when you're half asleep in the middle of the night. And then all the random rustling sounds. Sleep's hard with that shit going on. And then people noise. Goddamn. People don't realist how goddamn loud they are with the cars revving and doors slamming and all the yelling.  I need the peace and stillness of being on my own, preferably outside, with the wind blowing (and if I have my way I can hear the ocean too). But you can still keep your silence. That isn't for me."
MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,bloodchit,4,Mon Feb 2 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"That's a good distinction to make -- silence vs. stillness. Agreed. I love stillness, when everything closes down, like on a hot summer day under cool, moist shade. Silence is too abstract, too big."

Just brilliant.  Instantly reminded me of ""Reconciliation""  by Walt Whitman (which by the way is featured wondrously as text in Ralph Vaughan Williams' ""Donna Nobis Pacem""), when he writes,  ""That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world;"""
MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,tomyrisweeps,5,Mon Feb 2 17:55:18 2015 UTC,"I can completely relate, though mine was more finding stillness  I didn't find mine until I found myself on an acupuncture table unable to move at all without having the needles tweek in a very uncomfortable way.  I couldn't move and had to learn to deal with it.  That expanded into the martial arts practice where we stand still in position for over twenty  minutes.  it was excruciating at first, but now I crave the stillness, and the silence of that type of meditation."
MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,Dittybopper,4,Mon Feb 2 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"Powerful story, loved it. For me I have to have my ""alone time"" each day, it is usually in the morning if I can arrange it. If I don't get it I'm a cranky SOB, off my center. When I was married with a young child I'd get up two hours before the wife and child, just drink coffee and stare off into space, nothing really on my mind, my quiet time with myself. Then, of course, came the hustle of the day, getting it all done. Put the mask back on, smile, wade into the incoming shit. I wish I could give more than one upvote for this one Grinder.  /u/AM said the truth too, good riff there /u/AM."
MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,bloodchit,3,Mon Feb 9 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's odd. I never even knew silence actually existed until I took a trip out west.   Midday. I was alone, sunning myself astride a large trailer that had been converted into a residence on the property where I was visiting, dropped deep into a Utah canyon. As I was glazing the landscape, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. Cocked my head to clear the sensation -- nothing happened. Cocked my head again. Nothing. It wasn't until a few seconds later that an iron bell around a horse's neck clanged, and I realized I'd just heard absolute silence, literally the absence of noise. Not a single breeze, a rustle of leaves, a passing car, a voice, footsteps, ambient air traffic -- nothing.   That was the day I realized that venerable silence is actually a vacuum, disorienting and interminable. There was no comfort in pure silence.  That said, I live in a boisterous neighborhood in a big city in a chatty country and I'd rather sacrifice my underwear than my nightly earplugs. I prefer silence that I can control!"
MilitaryStories,2ugfw0,illuzion25,2,Fri Feb 6 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"While I cannot pretend to know what brought you to this space and this realization, this one really resonates with me.  I think a big part of it is just having peace and quiet and not having to grind your teeth and not having to worry. To be able to be blank and full of the world at the same time. It can be very meditative if you let it. But that first noise though, man, I know what you're saying. The mailbox. A key in the door. The neighbor slams their door. It's kind of like being slapped unexpectedly.  Best quiet places I've ever found. There's a place called Steep Ravine just north of San Francisco. It's not silent, but it's quiet. Very few people know about it and you can camp and just listen to the ocean and whatever other odd sounds that people don't usually notice. If you're willing to hump it there are some great spots in Yosemite. Just out in the middle of a field under the stars, listening, looking with your natural night vision. As I'm sure you're aware, there are some really secluded spots around Tahoe. My favorite, however, was I was supposed to go camping with some friends in Idaho. I was supposed to meet them there. I got lost and ended up in Montana. Dark, cold and alone and away from what seemed like everyone and everything. I could never find it again in a million years. A small creek, tall grass and more stars than I've ever seen at one time.  I feel you on this one man. Good shit. Time for me to turn this music off and go get secluded. Thank you."

He started walking onto a Russian boat, in the company of Russians, during the Cold War, and got hemmed up by Military Intelligence-type people?

Who better to test soldiers than soldiers?  Who better to game against than the best players in the world?  When the restrictions were mostly removed from our actions (within reason) we were ""deadly"" opponents.  The worst thing about being BlueFor was that you knew OpFor had the same training, but more freedom.  As BlueFor there was a script to follow, with a little room for improv.  As OpFor it was all improv, as long as it stayed within the bounds of the script.    We all joke about the combat arms guys being stupid, har har, but it is a thinking mans game.  Constantly reading everything, eyes up, head on a swivel.  Is that guy acting different because he walks weird, or is he walking weird because he's acting different?  On a completely unrelated note, I've shown this to a couple of people today.  They weren't impressed.  I thought it was pretty cool.  Posted it to /r/oddlysatisfying.

You have to understand the amount of training you guys did is utterly alien to my own military experience. They just ran us through a series of rote drills - shoot your gun, march, get ambushed, survive and escape. They were processing all of us like draftees - two-year window. Train 'em, ship 'em, let 'em fight, ship 'em back, muster 'em out.  I don't envy all the training you went through. Sounds arduous. But I remember being thrown in the deep end of the pool with only minimal training. That wasn't much fun either.  I was only being bummed that in the last 50 years, everyone who was native to the land and on our side was a crook or a sycophant. We kept looking for Founding Fathers, Democracy Lovers and Patriots. They were all on the other side. Every time.  There are, I guess, some things that have to be home grown. How long is it gonna take before that lesson sinks in?"

We'd throw a handful of nails into the cast when we poured them.  That gave a nice metal signature for mine detector operators to get a hit on, if they were buried.  The ones in the story would be concrete copies of M15's.  Fun fact, odd numbered mines are Anti-Tank (AT), and even numbered ones are Anti-Personnel (AP), in the US inventory.

MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,ColdSteelRain,12,Thu Jan 22 06:16:58 2015 UTC,"I would tell you it's not your fault. You tell yourself the same thing. Bring in a panel of be-medaled combat-seasoned soldiers from the Pentagon, and they would all tell you it's not your fault.  Doesn't matter. No matter how many times you are absolved, you're still drowning in fault. It doesn't go away either. I spent decades acquitted, exonerated, exculpated, blameless and guilty as sin.   I tried to tough it out. That didn't work. I came up with something, way late in the game.   Maybe we can short-circuit your ordeal. Do me a favor - read Dark. The Gunny has something to tell you."

It's taken that long to really digest.  Thank you. It helps. Maybe it will help me short-circuit things after all. Guess we'll find out."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Sun Jan 25 06:27:03 2015 UTC,"Good. ""Dark"" is the story of how things turned around for me. I'm not going to say it was all bad before, and all good afterward. Didn't even recognize that moment at the Small-Wall as a turning point until I wrote ""Dark"". I thought I was writing about glowing bugs in the jungle.  But that was it. I remembered the Gunny there at the wall. I had slathered that memory with my guilt and emo-drama queen imagination about how I could've-should've-would've saved him. By the time I rescued my memory of him from the sad-kabuki costume I had dressed him in, he was pissed. At me. Again. Not because I didn't save him - hey, a Marine knows those are the breaks - but because I was still that panicked kid El Tee floundering in the deep end way over his head. He trained me better'n that.  He was right, too. Again. So I sucked it up, and remembered him right. We're friends now. In my head, he is the Gunny I remember. He wants me to shut up about him, and get him a beer. I will fail at those two things too. He knew that. He's kind of an asshole.  I don't know where your LT is now, or if he is anywhere at all - you don't either. The only LT you have to deal with is the one who lives on in your head. Izzat him? The guy you described in the OP? Seems like a good LT, cared about his men, died taking care of them. Bad luck.  Ask him about it. You were one of his guys. Does he want you to feel like you do? I'm guessing he's in your head fuming trying to figure out a way to get in front of you and straighten you up. No troop as unhappy and sad as you are has any chance of scaring him up a beer. Dude, you're the host of his party. Remember him right. You want to make it right? Be good company. Figure out a way to get him a beer.   Then tell me. I get gigged every day at about 1730. Gettin' old."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Sun Jan 25 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"Hey Brother, I like to pass this along when things like this come up.  It took me a long time to figure this out, and I didn't figure it out.  It kind of came out organically from a group session at the VetCenter, for OIF/OEF vets.  Once we had this epiphany, the whole mood changed.    The topic was Survivors Guilt, or just Guilt for not being there when something bad happened.  I'm just throwing this out there, because I've found that a change of perspective doesn't change what happened, but for me it changes what I think about it in the here&now.  We got on the subject, and my doppleganger was in the group.  The details were a little different, but the outcome was the same.  Dude was supposed to be in the turret, FRAGO, his buddy took his spot.  Dude got shot, lived, but you know...That was supposed to be me!  The counselor brought up all of the tired saws, and I'm sitting there thinking, and he keeps talking about how if it was anybody else, you wouldn't fault them, would you?  Of course not.  Anybody who's been in combat knows that fucking everything is random and out of control, for the most part.  All of a sudden it clicked.  Mass punishment.  Why'd your Joe get a DUI?  From day one we're held accountable for actions outside of our control.  That's how it works for us.  Then when something bad happens, even though we've done everything we can to mitigate, if it falls even remotely under our sphere of influence, we're programmed to take responsibility for it, and we do, and it sit in the soul and nips and gnaws.  All of those what ifs and I could have's keep on.  I don't know if I've explained that very well.  I hope so.  I've found that a minor change of perspective and an understanding of why, has made a huge difference.  That and time.  Anyhoo...I'll get off my soapbox.  I don't want to call it a good story, because I don't like it, but it's well written.  I looked at the first paragraph a couple of times and thought, not reading that today.  Thank you, though."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,AnathemaMaranatha,4,Sun Jan 25 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, wow that makes sense. Makes a lot of sense. Will have to digest that one for a bit. Thank you.   Agreed, not a good story. Not fun to tell. Took a few glasses of scotch."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,SoThereIwas-NoShit,2,Sun Jan 25 06:25:38 2015 UTC,"Huh. Hadn't thought about it this way. Responsibility.  Okay, maybe I was in different place mentally. I have two stories that deal with Surviviors' Guilt. One is ""Dark"", where I felt bad that the man who had been responsible for me, died because I wasn't there. More about that in the other comments, but I wasn't there, I didn't kill him, I never killed any friendlies with my artillery, something I am still grateful for. I felt guilty that I wasn't there to keep him from being killed.  In The Third of July I dealt with the death a guy who I was responsible for - a guy directly under my command, and at the time, literally directly under me. I was responsible for his safety, and that frog-eyed Shrapnel God stuck his elbow in my eye as he reached right past me and took the life of my Recon Sergeant. I feel some sadness for that, but I don't detect mass quantities of guilt. Anger, yes. Still am pretty angry about that.   Sergeant Clark and I were close by proximity and shared responsibility for each other and a grudging mutual respect. Not sure we were ever friends. Pretty sure I don't want to meet up with him in the Sweet-by-and-by - maybe just to wave and apologize for taking so long to catch up with him.   I'll be later than I should be, because if I am wrong about everything, and it turns out some facsimile of me endures in exalted spiritual form after death, Heaven can wait, and Hell will have to. I'm gonna go find that frog-eyed sonofabitch godling and do what evil I can to him. I got God-shit all over me. He was rude, and contemptuous, and I think he winked at me as he put his elbow in my face. We need to talk.  Nobody else feel like that? I think I'm doing this Survivor Guilt thing wrong."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,AnathemaMaranatha,4,Sun Jan 25 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Angry?  Yeah, sure.  Plenty, but I don't want to go after gods.  I was lucky, and I don't have any stories about friends getting killed.  I was friends with people who lost friends, and I knew a couple of those who were killed, but that's beside the point.  I'm angry at the motherfuckers who sent us there in the first place.  I watched Iraq fall apart around us, and after we left it just got worse.  Afghanistan just felt like ""what the fuck are we even doing here?""  I mean, what were we doing?  It didn't make any sense in either place, it was comedy of the absurd, in both really.  But it cost lives.  I wish we lived in a society that held the decision makers accountable.  I'd love to see trials of all of the politicians who backed both theaters.  I'd love to see them have to answer, collectively, for our deaths and the damage caused to honest people trying to just live their lives.  I think the politicians involved should have to stand trial, at the conclusion of a war, and either be found just, or be publicly hanged on the Mall.  That'll never happen, so I have to just hope that they can't sleep at night and are haunted by their decisions.  I know they aren't though.  They don't care, we're just numbers to them.  If there's any justice in the here-after, they'll be met by us, kind of like fucking with an Officer by spacing out so he has to salute each and every one of you as you pass.  I just don't care anymore.  My give-a-shit tank is empty."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,SoThereIwas-NoShit,3,Mon Jan 26 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Ah. That. In my war, we were sent by foolish people, steeped in American invincibility, sick with a Manichean view of the world, unable and unwilling to see subtlety, unable and unwilling to see the difference between pride and arrogance. It was all of us, at the start - me included. We proudly sacrificed, stacked the bodies like cordwood expecting to display them sadly and proudly at the inevitable victory parade.  To their credit, my leaders suffered remorse and confusion when it all came crumbling around them. They truly represented most of us. When we failed, they failed. I am angry at them, but they seem humiliated enough. All I want now is a piece of the Death God.  In the last 50 years America has suffered the theft of its salaries, infrastructure, education, factories, jobs and national wealth by class of managers who imagine themselves as industrialists and nation-builders. What they have built is a new nobility of wealth - an untouchable, privileged class who feel entitled to rule because money. They are arrogant beyond belief, stupid, weak people who imagine themselves truly gifted and rewarded by God and Destiny to lead the nation.  Your war started well, but was sidetraced by stupidity, unjustified pride and unrepentant greed fostered by leaders who admire that as an American virtue. They bought the all-volunteer military, and they felt privileged to use it wrongly, to break it tending to their empire-building fantasies. They are not strong enough to retain power, not self-examining enough to know that, not wise enough to do anything about it.   They will be swept aside and devoured by a tyrant, sooner or later. You are the other 1%. You and your comrades have a moral authority that may enable you to take the nation back from these bumbling, foolish pampered clowns. Yes, you should hate them. They treated you badly, and they don't give a shit. What happened was your fault. You failed the plutocratic idiocracy.    be publicly hanged on the Mall.   I like your methods. Good luck with that. I only want to punch out Death. I think my odds of winning are better. But - finally! - you have a stand-up fight ahead of you, if you want it. Your choice - go to ground, or go to war at home. I'm old. I honestly don't know what I'd choose. Your turn. Sorry."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Mon Jan 26 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Your war started well...   Are you fucking kidding me?  Am I insane?  Iraq never made any sense.  None.  I remember the whole year and some change before we did them.  I think first it was portrayed as 'Saddam has ties to 'terrorist organizations', and then right before we left it was 'WMD!', and then we found out we were 'Liberating the Iraqi people', because aren't we nice?   It was all just propaganda, on the heels of September Eleventh, talking points and heaps of bullshit.   Shovels full, just bullshit.  I didn't buy it when we went there, or even before...  I think the only way is un-seating the Party.  I don't think our system works for anybody but the ones in power.  Republican?  Democrat?  Same thing, policy-wise.  I think we have to get them both out, but how?   Sometimes I think I just want to leave this country."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,treborr,3,Tue Jan 27 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"Your war started well...   Are you fucking kidding me? Am I insane?    Sorry. I wasn't clear. The Oil Wars started with Kuwait (which paid for itself) and a punitive expedition to Afghanistan, which went surprisingly well - almost sealed the deal - until the White House switched the mission to nation-building and ordered a draw-down to prep for the invasion of Iraq.  By March of 2003, no doggy at the White House and the Pentagon was safe - they were in full Pooch-screw Mode, and at the same time assembling a hoard of corporate looters (all dear friends) to bundle up all the anticipated boodle and bring it home. George Bush's Triumph through the streets of Washington would eclipse even Titus' in gold idols and barrels of oil. That comb-sucking toady would gleefully announce to the crowds that Order had been restored to the oil supply and the whole Middle East in only six months. Pappy Bush was avenged! A new era begins now! No longer would the glory-hogging military men get all the credit. It was the Triumph of the Chickenhawk Bidnessmen! We were right all along! Fuck the French!  They couldn't wait. It would be great. It would make up for squandering of the credibility and honor of the United States of America to support the bald-faced lies they had to use to belligerently sell their war to the public at home and governments abroad.   What happened after that couldn't happen. Probably really didn't happen - stay tuned for the latest from Fox News - it's not fair, it's not balanced, it's not news. What I'm saying here is that there are insane people out there, but not you. Sorry. They seem happier."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,treborr,6,Tue Jan 27 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you got some help.   We all f-up. Sometimes, the results are tragic. You will never forget, but you can make this a life lesson.   WAS there anything that you realistically could have done better? Put yourself in time and context. Evaluate your actions as if they were those of a subordinate. Were they negligent? Or were they a prioritization of attention?   It seems like a lot of factors coincided--and you were only one of them. If the radio had been working, would the Lt. have been in the same position? If the vehicle had been one foot to either side, what would have happened?  Not playing the ""What-if"" game is a hard, hard challenge. If the Lt. could talk to you about the incident, what do you think he would say? From what you have described, he would smile, shrug his shoulders, and say something like, ""Shit happens."" And then ask what you would realistically do differently if the same situation happened in the future.  Honor him by learning and sharing your learning."

These things are buried months ahead of time, the only way you'll know it's there is to find the wire, and they're masters at concealing them. There were a dozen other people going over the same area. Still hard to accept that there was nothing I could have done better. Might not have even mattered, could still have bought it a million other ways.   Still hard to reconcile though, we're trained to act. To do something, anything. Not used to being powerless. Very hard to accept that there is nothing you can do."
MilitaryStories,2t9i7w,bloodchit,5,Thu Jan 22 13:59:38 2015 UTC,"Very hard to accept that there is nothing you can do.   Definitely. But now, you must use judo (or rope-a-dope) against the anguish. Most of us cannot fight it head-on. We must help it expend its energy.   Within us is that nagging doubt about what we COULD have done. It is there and will probably always be there. A defense is to accept the attack, but come up with a counter-strategy that deflects its power. I think the Lt. is your best bet.  Let him help you. Imagine he was in the bar that night, and you were apologizing to him. What would he say to you? Pay attention to his eyes as he tells you. What would he say to you? If you tell him you think you owe his wife/kids an apology, I'd bet he would say that there was NOTHING to apologize for.   If you need more help, look within yourself. What would you do if the situation were reversed. What would you tell the Lt. (and sincerely mean)?  You will NEVER forget. At the strangest times, something will remind you. Acknowledge that the doubt and guilt are there, but trust that the Lt. or you will help you keep things in perspective.   Hang in there, brother."

Too soon to tell.   ...maybe show her how sad and angry he was so she‚Äôd think better of it and not get mixed up with a loser like him.   CHECK FIRE!  I've been working on mending things with a wonderful, sweetsweet woman.  She finally told me some things, recently, that I don't even remember saying to her (blacked-out drunk) when I first got back from Afgh.  When she told me what I said to her, back then, I wanted to curl up and disappear.  I couldn't express how sorry I was, and obviously there wasn't any way to take it back.  Explanations were given, but even just thinking about what she told me I said makes me feel so...Remorseful?  I don't know what to call it.  I guess remorse is probably the best word available.  She also told me she knew, but it broke her heart, too.  Things went quietly spiraling from there until she split.  She couldn't do it anymore, and she left.  Good for her, stupid me.  I can't respect a person who can't respect herself, and that was the beginning of a wake-up call.  I guess it doesn't matter, now.  She's back, and that's a good thing.  I've never met a woman that I like as much as I like her.  I mean, I love her, but all you have to do is look at the entirety of your extended family, and you'll find someone you love but don't like.

It's a major part of why I'm now able to share these stories.   Really? Wow, tell that one, if you don't mind the rest of us hearing the salacious details. I had to wrestle with myself telling this one - I kept wanting to fill in details that I didn't have. Nope. Not my story.  Didn't happen to me. The OP is more of a portrait than a story. All I really saw was a big man standing very still and attentive as a woman walked confidently toward him. That's the picture.  My only interface with Jarhead was when Laurel finally got me to say something in group therapy. I said I had been at Quang Tri, working with Marines and ARVNs. That got me a searching, sympathetic look from Jarhead. I was a wreck, in blue pajamas and a striped bathrobe, happy-face plastic slippers. The day Jarhead left was my fourth day in - I had just taken my first dose of anti-depressants.  I remember saying ""Ranch girl"" to myself when I saw her walking up. She was coming at him the way I would've come at a skittish horse - I recognized the walk. You can't get so easy with a horse that you forget that he's 800 pounds of bone and muscle, hooves and teeth, and he can rip the skin off your face without even working up a sweat. You can't be afraid of that either - the horse will know.  I've unstuck a horse who was tangled up in wire, dragging a piece of it around behind him that was both hurting him and scaring him. I gave him a little song and dance to calm him down, spoke like a horse, and cut the wire off him. He was so surprised to find that wire gone, he kind of focused on me after that - maybe I could do something else amazing!  I dunno. You make stuff up, and I was in a crazy, unhappy, flatline state. Sometimes that makes you see things that aren't there. Sometimes, you see things that you wouldn't normally see - real things.   It's one or the other. To me, Jarhead was watching Ranch Girl the same way that horse watched me. Even without knowing what the poodle meant, it seemed to me that she had untangled him in some way that astonished him. Maybe so. Maybe I was nuts and telling myself crazy stories.  When I finally got the poop on the poodle, it all clicked in my head. She worked him like a stuck horse, baffled him, distracted him, brought him up out of his own misery. Seemed right. Maybe not. It's a fun story that way.  So yeah, I'd really like to hear the story of your poodling. I want to know how much of the OP I made up, and how much - just maybe - really happened."
MilitaryStories,2t96fi,tomyrisweeps,11,Thu Jan 22 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Not a terribly interesting story, but I'll tell it here nonetheless, hope you'll forgive the story bomb.   When I first came back, I was a wreck. Drinking extremely heavily, a bottle of whiskey every other night. My life started exploding. Got into a destructive relationship that when it inevitably torpedoed made things even worse. If I wasn't at work, I was drunk. I don't think there was a single piece of furniture in my apartment aside from my TV and my bed that wasn't smashed to shit.   Tried to do the group thing but that interfered with my drinking so I stopped. Should have been committed to in-patient therapy, but had nobody looking out for me enough to make that call, and wasn't capable of making it myself. Met my Ranch Girl at work, she raised and trained horses when she was young, so has that in common too. We knew each other casually before then, but hadn't really taken much of an interest in each other. We started talking more, about everything.   Turns out, she's in an abusive relationship, I helped her find the strength to end it. Shortly thereafter, we got together. She treated me like you would any wounded animal who is hurt and scared, and I certainly didn't help things by constantly lashing out. When she stayed, that got my attention, gave me a reason to start fighting and stop wallowing in pity and misery.   She never left, no matter how much I lashed out or thrashed, just redirected me onto something different until I calmed down. I stopped drinking. For the first time in a year, my mind was clear. I finally started facing my demons, and my scars began to heal. They're not all better, never will be I suspect, but they've healed a ton and are continuing to heal.   We're still together, we still fight about things, I still have issues, but overall we're pretty happy. We helped each other out of the wire that we were dragging."

I'm stunned she could wean you off drinking. Almost everyone in the Psych Ward or outpatient was in AA, Jarhead included. You were lucky. Do it long enough, alcohol becomes a separate and totally equal problem independent of the reasons you were drinking in the first place.   Thanks for the feedback.

Well sort of, its a long story and I'm much better at reading than I am at writing.  Basically the short version is I was an alcoholic before I went to war, and I was an alcoholic when I came home too.  I was a mostly harmless happy go lucky drunk before the war, and a total piece of shit drunk after.  It took a few years, but after one particularly shitty period of my life I realized that the happiest years in the last ten were the ones I spent in the sand. Sober.  I guess I'll just sit back, and let the writers write."

Many of the stories are powerful, but this one is simply... there has to be a word more powerful than powerful or awe inspiring. Put it here. It's not just because of the writing, but the way it demonstrates how important that moment of realization was for you that you can recognize it (or perhaps search for it) in other people.  Anathema, you've become a figure for a lot of people. I won't say the four letter word beginning with 'h', because quite frankly, I suspect it's got all the wrong connotations behind it for you and other residents of this sub.

I'm not sure what one can take from the OP. It's not true. I probably got a lot of the facts wrong, or somebody else did. What is non-fiction is that at that time in my life, I saw a portrait of a woman walking toward a waiting man, and in my head it came out to mean the OP. That's the way I remember it, that's the way this story happened to me.  I've had one other experience like this, where something improbable waltzed into my brain while it was flatlined and played out - see ""Charlie and the Kid"" in The Third of July. That didn't happen the way I described it either, but that's what happened. I've been calling them ""Arjuna Moments,"" when the curtain of the world is drawn back and the joker gods show you more than you can handle, so much it sets your hair on fire.  Huh.

Got to be a happy ending for people every so often. Well, maybe not so much a happy ending as a comfortable way point (because we all know happily ever after is a load of shit, and good old Cinderella would have ended up finding out all the reasons her prince wasn't quite so charming in the end). I'm glad he got his ranch girl, and I'm glad he got poodled. Sort of reminded me of the check out chick - all the different ways people can get pulled out of the mire in their head. Got to be a few other ways too. They all seem to involve other people though. Guess that's the key to it. Can't lock yourself away forever.

I was at a very low point. I just noticed it, threw it in my mental in-box for later, and went on through some deep shit.   As time went by, I kept moving stuff from my in-box, but always left that inside - something pending. Every time I unburied it, I'd look, snurk ""Huh. Poodled. Ha"" and leave in the ""pending"" file.   Sometimes the angels lay something away for you. Slowly, slowly, you are slain by the spirit...

I wrote a book of stories once, called A Beginner's Guide to Adultery, about clever people in love trying to figure out what was happening to them. I stole the last lines from the public domain.    I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was:  man is but an ass, if he go about to expound this dream.  Methought I was - and, methought I had, - but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had.  The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.

There were a lot of people in the CP looking at me sorta slack-jawed and goggle-eyed.   Seen that look a few times.  It usually had to do with throwing munitions.  They were safe, but the Grunts didn't know that.  I think the best ""goggle-eyes"" I ever got were after we busted into a compound, the goddamned Grunts wouldn't let me blow the gate and they spent five minutes breaking my small bolt-cutters beating on the lock, and as we rounded the gate one of the ICDC's (precursor to Iraqi Army) accidentally fired off a round.  It skipped off the concrete and hit another ICDC in the hand.  I heard BANG and dropped to a knee as I brought my weapon up, only to see the embarrassed demeanor of the shooter and his buddy holding his shot-hand by the wrist and looking confused.  It was obvious that nothing was happening, this in the space of no time at all, and as I was standing up I looked behind me for my Boy.  All I saw was the top of a K-Pot and a couple of eyeballs peering at me from around the corner of the wall.  I think he was worse goggle-eyed than the kid who'd caught bullet fragments in the hand.  edit.    I have to add this stuff on re-reading.  Re-re, I've been called a window licker, and I'll take it as a compliment.  The Grunts was in-charge, we were along for the ride.  We tried climbing the wall, but body-armor made climbing the wall too heavy.  They had all of the nasty broken glass formed into the top of the wall, but ceramic plates and GI make a body not really care.  The sad part was that we couldn't get high enough to get over the wall.  We tried boosting, but that didn't work.  Nobody could get up high enough to get over the stupid thing.  I think I just kept saying, 'I can blow the gate.', and kept getting shrugged off.  After the Climbing Of The Waal failed enough, and I'd shown that my little pair of bolt-cutters couldn't cut the lock, they asked to borrow them.  Leave it to the Infantry to just beat hell out of a padlock with a pair of bolt cutters.  That's a reality, and a metaphor.  They broke the bolt cutters, but they broke the lock too.  Of course, we could've had it open on a ten second fuse and a charge, but they got it open, and I didn't get to blow a gate.  And then Haj shot his buddy, sort of, and we had a Team come out of nowhere behind us and say, ""Dudes!  We almost Lit you up!""  Bangalored.    You knock them out of the park, my friend.

Oh y'know. That was my nisei Captain in the OP. We didn't know each other very well. He seemed to think an artillery Forward Observer was like a personal valet. True, he was the officer in charge of fire support, but I wasn't attached to him at the hip. He eventually learned to let me go a little. For instance, it was Cav policy that company commanders come into an LZ on the second gaggle. I convinced him to let me go in on the first slick of the first gaggle. I needed to be on the ground.  I feel obligated to mention that you don't learn how to read shrapnel in a class. I learned OJT. I never heard shrapnel on a tin roof, but I know what it sounds like frisbeeing down through the trees, and what it sounds like going up through the trees. With a 105mm battery, that's about 200-250 meters in the first case, increasing in intensity with proximity, and 100-150 meters, or less, in the second case, depending on intensity.   perishable skill.

MilitaryStories,2t3vdk,djabelek,3,Wed Jan 21 21:18:21 2015 UTC,How's the book coming along?
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,ColdSteelRain,18,Tue Jan 20 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"Rereading this I realize two things I failed to emphasize as much as I should have. I was totally tripping balls while we were firing, and with the huge amount of dust blowing around and the fire coming out of the tube, I swear to god I was thinking I was being attacked by a goddamn dragon, with shit exploding on the mountain in the background. LOTS of shit.  The second thing is just how fast we're firing. Technically we went a bit over time, about 1 min and 12 seconds for this Mad Minute, but that's 65 rounds EACH from two guns. That is an INSANE firing speed. By this point though, we'd fired several thousand combat rounds and could do this in our sleep."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,SoThereIwas-NoShit,15,Tue Jan 20 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"I can tell you /u/AnathemaMarantha loves indirect, and his panties get all soggy when you combine indirect and secondaries!    ""Happy New Year!  Motherfuckers!""  Awesome story!  You sound like you weren't in way back when they were prescribing Mefloquine as an anti-malarial.  Apparently they stopped because it was supposedly inducing suicides.  We'd take it once a week, and for whatever reason that day was monday.  We called them Mefloquine Mondays.  Didn't really have any effect that was noticeable, until you went to sleep, and then it was a night of far-out hallucinations.  I mean the most insane technicolor, bizzaro world, all-night (or as long as you got to sleep) dreams.  Continuous from beginning to waking.  I fucking loved it.  As far as the Ambien, never took it in Afghanistan, but a lot of our guys did.  I wanted Adderall, but couldn't get my hands on it.  No hook-ups stateside.    We had the E-6 from our Detection & Interrogation element take the Buffalo for a drive around around the FOB in the middle of the night, O-e, in only his PT shirt.  He put it into a ditch and rolled it.  The story goes that he came limping back into the Company area, stark naked with his PT shirt wrapped around his foot, which had been gashed open.  I saw the cab of the Buff the next morning, and it looked like somebody'd been knifed to death in there.  Fuckin' blood everywhere, complete with bloody foot and hand prints.  He lost his rocker, whic wasn't really fair.  Anyway, love the story.  Love the unexpected outcome, too.  Fuck yeah!  I'm about to start working on the JRTC one you reminded me of."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,SoThereIwas-NoShit,6,Tue Jan 20 03:11:28 2015 UTC,"Excellent, I look forward to reading it.   I was still in when they did Mefloquine, though they moved to Doxycycline as the preferred pill, which you took once a day. Took it for a few weeks and then it made me sick, so I got moved to Mefloquine. Only had one Mefloquine Monday, and had the worst nightmares ever, and told the Doc I'd personally shoot his ass if he made me take it again.  Talking of doing shit wearing non-regulation clothing reminds me of another story that I'm writing down to tell at some point, which also shows just how much people love us Chucks after we save everyone's collective asses.  Also, in our company moto video after the Deployment (Which I may or may not post here publicly) there was a quote from one of the PLs on that night right after the Mad Minute, it actually closes the video out, with him jumping on the net and screaming ""HAPPY NEW YEAR COLD STEEL WHHOOOOOOOO. CUR-TWOS OUT!"" (His name being Curtis). Pretty good stuff."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,SoThereIwas-NoShit,3,Tue Jan 20 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"It was Doxy when I was in Afghanistan.  We had Mef for malaria, and Doxy, I'm guessing a really high dosage, when we were in Saudi (just before Iraq 2).  The Doxy there was for if we got slimed.  I remember being in tent city in Ar Ar, prior to the invasion, and the Battalion Surgeon came around for whatever reason.  Maybe he was asking if we were taking our Mef, I don't know, but he found out we were taking the Doxy too, and the look on his face completely changed.  ""You aren't supposed to be taking that!  Who told you to take that?""  ""Uh...the Medic, Sir?  Why aren't we supposed to be taking it?""  ""You'll be fine.  Just don't take it anymore.""  ""Roger, Sir.  Why aren't we supposed to take it, though?""  ""It's only for biological weapons.  Stop taking it, all of you.  That's a direct order.""  And then he left.  Later I looked it up on Merck Manual or whatever, and it was what was responsible for me blacking out and almost passing out when we were fortifying our tent against an incoming sandstorm.  Side effects including sensitivity to sunlight.  I never touched it again until we had the Fever burn through us in Baghdad, and then I took a pill of Doxy a day for about a week.  Shitting my guts out and shivering in my sack inside of a hundred-and-twenty degree room.  I figured if anything was going to work, the anti-bioweapon shit would.  We took turns watching the guys who had it, when we were over it, or before we were bad into it, and they'd just lay there moaning and sweating and shivering, and zombie their way to the shit can, with an escort of course, and crawl back into their fart-sack and look like they were going to die, while we pushed water on them or they got IV's.  I came down with it late, and I think I was only out of it for a day or two, sick as fuck for a few days or a week, but I think the Doxy kept me from looking like I was gonna fucking die.  I'd be interested in seeing that video.  I've got two from Afghanistan, on Route Jeep.  Day iteration, shot by the truck behind mine.  Night iteration, a few kilometers down the road."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,oberon,3,Tue Jan 20 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"Ask and you shall receive.   It's worth noting that the firefight that starts just before the 7 min mark is the closest I've ever been dying, and the only time I was absolutely convinced I was dead. The ridgeline they're shooting at goes down to the left as a spur, and I'm at the base of it with two other guys due to a series of miscommunications, and the Taliban is just up the spur and along the ridge from us, within about 200m and laying down really heavy fire trying to cut us off and capture us. You can see some of our 60mm rounds impacting along the ridge trying to walk them in close enough. I was messed up pretty good, but we all managed to come out mostly okay. That'll be a story for another day though.  Also at about 19:56, you can see the terrain I was talking about in our previous thread in my last story. This is just a bit north of the COP, so the road isn't completely terrible there, but you can see the drop offs.  I always hated fighting at Night. Was really cool, but very disorienting."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,snimrass,2,Tue Jan 20 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"And now I'm sporting a chubby.  Don't like it one bit, but there's nothing I'd rather see than effective fire.  In that Night Iteration I linked, most or all of the outbound tracers are from my Gunner with the M2 and 240, and the SAW and M4 and 203 is from me.  The inbound tracers, from the stupid fuck we had a fix on, well...it was about 4-500m.  You can see the burning goodness on the right side of the screen where one of the MK-19 gunners killed a big pile of something.  We were in a twisty-turny road with draws, and a nice kil-zone, so it was tough to get more than one truck to engage, and our Husky was disabled, so a road tampon."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,Dittybopper,3,Tue Jan 20 05:32:27 2015 UTC,"We got pretty brutally effective with the 60mm. There's one of our massive Willy Pete clouds on the ridgeline at one point in that video that we used to box in people who shot at us, and hold them in place until the fast movers could drop on them, that's assuming we couldn't kill them ourselves.  You can see how quick on the gun we were in one of the night bits, where we're laying down the hatred with both tubes. That was actually the mad minute I was talking about, so I was tripping massive balls through the whole thing. Imagine being the guys on the receiving end when those started punching through the roof of that school....  That long firefight I was talking about in the middle of the vid, after a few minutes they were too close to keep using the 60, and the terrain was just awful for it, so we were engaging with rifles at that point. That was close. Way too close."

I enjoyed your story, it sparked some memories of a long ago July 4th I experienced in Vietnam. We Americans won't be denied our explosive orgasim on Independance Day. Glad yours resulted in stopping an attack.  Thank you, anticipating your coming ""dump"" on this forum, enjoying your remembrances."

These stories are all several years old, to the point where even some people who were there have forgotten them. I have realized now that I need to tell these stories, get them out there, before they are forgotten. Not out of any desire for my own glory (though I do have my fair share of stories about myself) but because I owe it to these guys. I served with the best men I've ever known, and they and their deeds should never be forgotten.  I'll be telling at least one more story this week, though it will be less funny, it's kind of amusing in hindsight. After that, I will most likely take a short break to prepare myself and get in the right state of mind, as there's at least two to four stories I need to tell, that are not at all funny, one of which I've mentioned in this comment thread. They will most likely be told without prose, and as brutally matter of fact as I can make them, since using flowery writing on such serious matters makes them more trivial which they most certainly are not.  If anything, it is you fine readers who deserve MY thanks, not the other way around. These stories would have happened with or without a future audience to read them, but you all provide an outlet and let me share my memories while I'm still young enough to recall them. Even though some of the men in these stories are no longer with us, they'll live on as long as these stories are told and retold, maybe not in name, but in deed."

We know how it is, we have been there.   Mad Minute. We had those in vietnam too, usually at or near dusk each day while in the field, the bush. The form was to clean your weapon then test it during the Mad Minute and then not mess with it unless you needed it during the night for real. This way you would have every assurance possible it would function as expected. I have seen the jungle ""move back,"" get chopped down and receding away during a mad minute, trees falling and underbrush flying apart. Awesome firepower from ""mere"" small arms. You would then tuck in (no pills) with your weapon snug in your grasp."
MilitaryStories,2t08bo,SmithersNH,4,Tue Jan 20 05:49:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely. These are the stories that when they come up in group conversation among other people who were there, result in conversation tapering off and a long silence holding sway. They're not fun to talk about, but they need to be said and recorded. If anyone can relate, it'll be you guys.

Spectacular imagery.   ""Mad minute,"" huh? An armored cavalry unit I was with used to do what was called a ""Thunder Run"" down a road through civilian-occupied villes. We usually just ran the road, but after we'd been sniped and and mined enough, we'd do a night run. I was told that any villager who didn't know enough not to be out roadside at night, wasn't a local guy and probably was up to no good.  I suppose. We ran the road firing everything we had. After we did that, we felt better. I believe that was the point. Because guns. We had some. We wanted to shoot them. A lot. On full auto. Because.  No hearts and minds were won. I bet they remember us, though. Still.  Crazy funny story. I don't recall ever letting our 11C's loose like that. Shame. Sounds fun."

The idea being that you had a minute to hit a 12"" round target at 300 yard with a bolt action rifle (10 rounds feed with stripper clips) a minimum of 15 times, the average being around 30 hits and the record being 38."

Dude!  Keep that stuff in!  Were you guys at Shugart-Gordon, or one of the little Villes?  I thought I was about out of stories, and you just reminded me about how me and a couple of other guys almost shut down JRTC by getting captured and going missing, involuntarily impersonated a General Officer, and puked all over one of our less-than-loved E-6's while he was sleeping.  New blood!  Keep 'em coming!"
MilitaryStories,2svbcx,SoThereIwas-NoShit,12,Sun Jan 18 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"I wanted to leave that stuff in, but figured it was already getting rather long, and I tend to be fairly prosy with my writing. I can leave it in for future stories if it is desired.  We were at one of the little pretend COPs, Sword I think? Was about a half-hour drive from the main gate on to Polk. The actual school building in the story was in one of the MOUT sites on JRTC, I want to say Sangan maybe?  Regarding the state of mind, just things like previous to this 5 day op, my section had been tasked to a week long air assault op, so by the time this all ended, we hadn't changed clothes or showered for almost two weeks. Also, it was the end of May when this went down, so massive dehydration. I recall sucking up an IV bag in about 10 minutes when they were voluntarily sticking people at ENDEX.  Earlier in this rotation, we manned a patrol base that got notionally overrun, I was the only non-casualty from our section. My buddy Brian ""bled out"" while I was carrying him, so we hammed it up with me screaming and asking God why. The Squad Leader in the above story had a ""broken spine"" as his injury, and another line Squad Leader who is the source of many stories had a ""concussion"" and pretended to grab a rock and brain him to death with it, telling him ""Shhh buddy, it's okay, no more tears. Only dreams now.""   Freaked the guys manning the notional aid station out something awful.   Regarding other incidents of my klepto-mania coming in handy, eventually I'd be the one to take our broken shit to the rear to get fixed, because we fired so many rounds overseas that we'd go through 2-3 60mm tubes a month (No, seriously, this is not an exaggeration). So when one firing pin melted or mushroomed, I'd hop on a bird to the BN FOB or to Bagram and either badger the maintenance folks until they fixed it, or if they took too long I'd steal the parts and fix it myself, if not just steal a new tube.  We also MIGHT have had 2-3 full sets of BII somehow just....appear gradually over the course of deployment, but I know nothing about that.  Regarding the Bayonet, we were issued them for a BN level Change of Command ceremony, which oddly enough is literally the only time in my 6 years in the Army that I was ever issued one. I signed out two, one for me and one for my SSG, we did our little dog and pony show, took both bayonets back to the Supply Sergeant who returned the Hand Receipt and I walked back to my squad. We get a good count that all bayonets are accounted for, the box they're in is locked and we SP back to the Armory. Close of business comes around, I throw my ruck in the bed of my truck, drive home, grab my ruck out of my truck and a bayonet falls out. To this day I honestly have no clue how it got there.  I'd love to hear your shut down of JRTC story, your other stories are hilarious. Feel free to story bomb this thread."

Regarding my time at JRTC, that was in '02, so it was all still Cold War training against conventional forces.  Where were you at in Afghanistan?  I was mostly out of Orgun-E, but we were in Sharana for a month or so, made it as far north as Gardiz, as far south&west as Warrior, and as far east as Margah, right on the border."
MilitaryStories,2svbcx,SoThereIwas-NoShit,5,Sun Jan 18 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Oh, I am DEFINITELY an asshole. Just ask any of my guys. Then again, they were assholes too.  Regarding Afghanistan, I was in RC-East from 11-12, specifically Laghman/Nuristan provinces way up in the Hindu Kush, we were the next major terrain feature west of the Pech River Valley, and a major flow route for weapons and fighters from Pakistan. Pretty hairy area, but if it wasn't for all the fire and death, would be a really pretty place to visit. Also visited Bagram and JBad a few times each, oh and Phoenix for a grand total of 15 minutes when my shithook touched down to drop off a CSM who diverted the flight to there just for himself.   I'll try to post one of the two stories mentioned at the end either today or tomorrow, and then more as my school work allows. Not sure how many of them are fit for telling in this format, but I guess we'll see.

MilitaryStories,2svbcx,admiralranga,3,Mon Jan 19 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"In the summer, it was over 100 degrees every single day. When we rotated in, it was during the 100 Days of Wind, can't remember the Pasto word for it. Constant wind and dust everywhere. Winter was brutally cold, coldest I've ever been.   Buddy of mine literally posted this pic to FB while we've been talking, so I ninja'd it. It was one of the small valleys offshooting from mine; the northern bend of the Pech is pretty much right behind the far ridgeline, maybe a bit further. http://imgur.com/hdF9iNl  It'd go from arid rocks and shrubs on the mountains, with cedars at the top of the high ones, to no-shit Vietnam style rice paddies and pot/opium fields down by the river, with a humidity change of 0 to 100% to match. I'd actually go on patrol by the river with an Ace of Hearts in my helmet band, chinstrap unbuckled and a cigarette in my mouth, with one headphone in and Creedence or The Doors playing on my iPod. Good times.  I always loved the sky, seeing the milky way so clearly, occasionally seeing the glare of afterburners from the fast-movers flying CAS. Many an overwatch when I couldn't sleep after my shift I'd just lay back and look at the sky.  Always wanted to steal a horse, never got the chance.

My dismounts there were pretty limited, and I remember the terrain more than the weather.  We should have had pack mules and mountain horses instead of vics and roads and IED's.  Anyhoo...I'll shut up now."

Besides reddit and rereading Starship Troopers on my kindle, I have nothing else going on.   We actually had a major terrain feature in our AO referred to as Afghan Stonehenge, so yeah, rock stacking motherfuckers. Don't ever play volleyball with an Afghan though either, those dudes had volleyball courts that were literally just two poles stuck into solid rock and a net. They'd still dive to make a save. Fuck that.   I really wish I had pictures of the terrain north of the COP in Nuristan. Super narrow road leading past an old bridge built by the Russians to a lovely little hellhole known as Doab. We only ever went that way about 3 times, and in the very beginning and I happened to be on one of those trips. The villagers hadn't actually seen Americans, and thought we were Russian.   Those roads were so narrow, you'd have sheer cliff face on your left going North, and a sheer drop of no shit, 500m down to a rushing river on the right. We'd actually scrape some of the armor plating off our MRAPs because even grinding against the cliff the tires would still be only an inch or two away from the edge. Roads were super shitty too, lots of holes and rocks, so it made the ride really REALLY bouncy. Had to hold the straps of our turret gunners so they didn't fly out. Ugh. Talk about white knuckling for an entire trip.

I'd like to hear about that.  The term ""King of Scrounge"" is, I think, several centuries into the public domain. Supply used to be a less paperworky occupation. I knew several - heard of more dating back to WWI.   In fact, I knew the Godfather of Scrounge. Dude boosted five five-ton trucks from the Marines. I'd tell the story, but y'know he wasn't much older'n I am, so he might still be out there. He was a W-4, didn't look like Cthulhu's S-4, but he was, so that just made him scarier.

MilitaryStories,2sfkt6,SoThereIwas-NoShit,14,Wed Jan 14 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious.  I had a fake set of two whole chevrons for a while in Basic or AIT, can't remember which.  It was almost as much of a pain in the ass as getting two real chevrons three years later.  Your story brought to mind a couple of two events.  The first is pre-Iraq, probably '02, at my duty station in North Carolina.  For whatever reason our Company Commander was there, and it was a relaxed environment.  Us lowlife enlisted scum were just smoking and joking, and got into the whole, ""stuff we smuggled or stole, uhh...I mean acquired, and squirreled away in Basic.""  We were talking about moon pies, fatty cakes, dip, etc.  I think I was sharing my method of getting coffee.  Mix milk and coffee while the drills weren't looking so it looked like chocolate milk.  That and stealing anything we could get our greedy little fingers on during KP.  This CO, by far my least favorite, was also a Pointer.  West Point graduate.  He kind of stopped us, and the look on his face changed.  ""You guys stole stuff?  That you weren't supposed to have?""  ""Well, shit, yeah, Sir.  How else were we supposed to get it?""  ""But you weren't supposed to have it.""  ""Ain't illegal if you don't get caught, Sir.""  I think it kind of blew his mind a little.  Even the other Officers in our Company thought he was a naieve ass, though, so maybe it was just him.  Second one, kind of a continuation of the first.  R2C2 Course in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  Late 2008.  Pre-deployment Talon robot training waste of time and money.  We never used our Talon once, but the course was a gentleman's course and who wants to turn down TDY?    We were in four man crews, I was with three other cats from my National Guard Company.  The culmination of our course, aside from written tests, was a ""route clearance"" where we were in a humvee with imaginary support.  It was a closed course out in the woods, with a road that we would drive along and look for and interrogate ""IED's"" as we found them.  Identify munitions, call up 9-Line UXO Reports, etc.  A Practical Exercise in Army lingo.    Well, a day or so beforehand, one of the guys in my group went into the instructors office to talk to one of the Cadre.  When he came back out he told us that he'd seen a map of our course, with all of the ""IED's"" clearly marked.  We came up with an off-the-cuff plan, and some bullshit questions.  Our group went in to talk to the instructor in the office, meanwhile I had my 2008 flip phone open and on camera-mode and on silent.  As the others blocked and distracted, I got multiple pictures of our future objectives.  Some may call it ""cheating"", I call it being resourceful and taking advantage of an opportunity.  Our group did the best, and the Cadre told us we were one of the best groups they'd ever had in the Practicals.  We actually made sure to miss on or two of the easier ones, and find the hard ones.  We were laughing all the way to the bank, and trying to keep straight faces as we bullshat our way through ""indicators"" with an instructor watching over our shoulders.  EDIT    I forgot about the maxim.  If you ain't cheatin', you ain't tryin'."

I goof off for half a day writing this up, then I spend the rest of the day wonderin' what happened. Sharing takes a lot of time.  We finally got the major attack on LZ Ellen later. It was like our intelligence people knew which way they were coming. The NVA infantry and sappers got blown to pieces. Never even broke the wire.  It's a pretty good guess that /u/Dittybopper's radio-intercept got a heads-up on their timing, but the actual plan of attack? Probably not on the radio. I wonder if my sapper gave it up. If so, he killed a lot of his buds.   So he gets rehabilitated and re-educated and gets a job - and six years later NVA tanks roll into Saigon. Was he there waving a flag? Don't think anyone was going to let him ride on the skids of those helicopters evacuating the US Embassy. Pretty sure the NVA would want to talk to him, if they knew he was alive.  I'm guessing he went to ground somewhere. I wonder if anyone ratted him out? I'm glad he didn't take us all out in a blaze of glory. I wonder if he was?"

I think I learned those same 10 words, probably got by with three or four, so you outrank me in speaking Ice Pick in the Ear, my favorite description of their language.

I kept trying to say ""Be cool"" in Vietnamese. Google translates that as y√™n l·∫∑ng. That wasn't what I was saying. I was saying the phrase Vietnamese officers shouted when they wanted the troops to calm down.   So there I was singing soprano like an opera diva on the edge of the stage as Siegfried battles Fafnir. It's possible I was squeaking ""Shut up, shut up, shut up, shutupshutup!"" I'm sure that helped. Wasn't my finest hour.  The testicles came back, but I'm not sure they've forgiven me to this day."

I remember Iraqis actually shitting and pissing themselves and crying when we zip-tied and bagged them.  They thought we were carting them off for execution.  Then we fed and watered 'em, took them to the slit trench when they needed it.  Some may have got rougher treatment, but if they followed the rules they got treated pretty well and nobody fucked with them."
MilitaryStories,2sbxng,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Wed Jan 14 05:16:20 2015 UTC,"A lexicon. Might be worthwhile for the military to compile a list of the most-used native language phrases from Vietnam and all the oil wars, and start compiling Baedekers for Ukraine, Korea, and the South China Sea. True Ambassadors of Freedom know how to say ""Spread your legs!"" in all the languages of the world.  Bangalore torpedo my stories, Grinder. You got the chops and a license. Essayons.    Must be weird to get prisonered by us.   Y'know, in Vietnam, guys who were patrolling villages and towns probably would be able to match your lexicon word for word.   When I was patrolling the dunes outside of Quang Tri, treatment and interrogation of civilians and prisoners were handled by local forces, ARVN and Ruff-Puffs. We were just the goon squad.   Where we were in III Corps, we weren't playing street cop. The NVA were a professional army, Russian trained. We didn't take that many prisoners - they made a point of carrying everything from the battlefield, wounded, dead and gear, in that order.   We would rate how bad we hurt them by what they left behind. Ammo and rocket tripods - not much. Base plate of an 82mm mortar - made you blink. Mortar tubes - made you ƒëi ƒëi mau, huh? Bodies - fucked you UP! Wounded - Wow. Holy shit. What're we supposed to do with these guys? See if there's a medivac free, will ya?  Was weird. The whole dynamic changed. We went into our ""wounded guy"" routine - medics to the front, call for medivac, give him a cigarette, anyone got a coke? Our routine for unlucky soldiers just spilled over onto wounded prisoners. I'm sure it was confusing for them.  I don't recall us ever capturing someone who wasn't wounded. Not sure what treatment we would've have given an unwounded prisoner. My bet is on coke and cigarettes. It's not hard to figure out why di√™n c√†i dao was for all participants the most recognized and used word during the Vietnam War."

MilitaryStories,2sbxng,djabelek,4,Sat Jan 17 10:00:08 2015 UTC,"I think I wrote elsewhere in the Comments about how hard it is to extract a story from all the strands of reality. You gotta make edges in the whole story where there are no edges, snip things that have too much of a story of their own, that will blow out a 10K , or even a 40K , character limit.  The other thing that happens is, that once I extract and write up an incident like this, what I wrote displaces the memory in my head. That ain‚Äôt right. Those other guys deserve to be named and explained.  I‚Äôve spent most of my morning chores reconstructing this little scenario in my head. Here‚Äôs what I got:  The Platoon leader was Kingfisher Two-Six, who has his own story in my head.. He knew I didn‚Äôt speak perfect Vietnamese. He was joking; I had complained about being mistaken for a translator to most of the senior staff of our company.  Second grunt was a tall, thin Black Man, who went by the name ‚ÄúBo‚Äô.‚Äù He was from some rough neighborhood in the states (Bed-Sty?), and was a very cheerful guy, for all that he was a very solid , reliable soldier. He liked to talk. He had been grinning and chatting up the sapper before I got there. I‚Äôm not sure what effect a tall, grinning, cheerful Black soldier, speaking run-on, incomprehensible English and holding an M-16 pointed at his head had on sapper/officer. Might have been reassuring. Might have been terrifying. Anyway, Bo‚Äô was back into the tanglefoot a step or two.  Cigarette grunt... I think he was one of the ones who came back in a few days after 2nd Platoon got knocked down like nine-pins. By the time of this story, he was a squad leader. Small guy, about my size. Hispanic, about my height (so not freakishly tall to sapper guy), really thick mustache. He was called.... Can‚Äôt remember. Some town in West Texas or southern New Mexico. Your field-name was whatever you wrote on your helmet. ‚ÄúDel Rio,‚Äù or something like that. Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúDel-Rio.‚Äù  Del Rio was a quiet guy, probably a Spec4. Maybe not. We couldn‚Äôt get anyone in the field promoted, no matter what slot they were filling. All the NCO stripes were gobbled up in the rear areas. Very calm and steady, reliable. He was standing close in, in the tangle of wires where the sappers had cut our tanglefoot. He had his M-16 on the sapper, too. He wasn‚Äôt talking.  The sapper was shirtless, with shorts and tennis-shoe boots. He had no sapper bag; I‚Äôm guessing he tossed all his gear and explosives to the guys who left him here. He was deepest in the wire - the dead sapper was right on the edge of the tanglefoot. Sapper/officer‚Äôs feet were completely wrapped in barbed wire, kind of torn up by that. Dried blood and mud everywhere. He was wheezing, hurting and disoriented. When he finally figured out I was trying to speak Vietnamese to him, he looked like a drowning man who had just been tossed a rope.  Del Rio grabbed Sapper/officer‚Äôs hand like he had done that 100 times before. He wasn‚Äôt panicked. He wasn‚Äôt even excited. All in a day‚Äôs work. He held it until Bo‚Äô secured a grenade pin, leaned over and pushed it in.  That was it. No awards ceremonies. No repercussions either, though I guess there was an intense discussion about why it‚Äôs wrong to move a wounded guy, unless it‚Äôs an enemy wounded, then you just have to. Never got any feedback on how that came out. The disturbing part of that was that the correct military solution - thoroughly search the wounded enemy soldier - would have probably killed everyone involved. Waiting for the medics was a mercy - to everyone - but a wrong solution.  But that was later. At the time, everyone thought the whole incident was hilarious. Del Rio got some ribbing. In fairness, it had been a busy night. Some S-2 guys had already helicoptered into the firebase and brought an interpreter with them. After the medics had snipped the wire off our sapper, they put him on a stretcher. I heard later he went off with the S-2 people.  Last I saw Del Rio was when I flew off back to ""the real world"" on the last log ship of the day. He seemed fine. Gettin' short. I hope he's at the VFW now, swappin' lies and livin' it up. He bought some karma with that fast thinking. I hope he spends it all before he checks out."

Send Uncle Oscar! He's a stitch, and he's smart to boot. He can speak for us, make friends and maybe spy a little. He'll make us popular with Big King!

MilitaryStories,2s7mn5,Dittybopper,9,Tue Jan 13 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"Six on, six off sucks. Stokers in our navy keep to a three watch system (four on, eight off), which gives you a bit more freedom in the day. There's some other crazy options though - 7/5 splits, a three watch system with four watches, so you never get into a rhythm ... You can see any we stick to something simple and reliable if possible."

MilitaryStories,2s7mn5,Sweetdreams6t9,4,Sat Jan 17 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"The refresher-type bullshit is what always pissed me off the most.  I was always on a weird shift (midnight - 10am, midnight-noon, etc.) and that was never taken into account when scheduling mandatory meetings.  My friends on the same shift as I had constant problems actually getting to sleep, and a solid night's rest was genuine cause for celebration.  We got so desperate for decent sleep that most of us developed serious sleeping pill / liquor habits.  I am honestly surprised that nobody killed themselves on accident by taking too many downers.  This also fed into mood disorders, up to and including suicidal ideation, in many soldiers including myself.  But fuck us in the ass, the cadre can't be arsed to schedule briefings at a time in their workday that doesn't interfere with my sleep schedule.  It'll be at 3:30pm because that's when it's convenient for them.  What really took the cake, though, was when I was in Iraq.  My platoon was detached from our main element, so I only saw our commander and 1SG once during the entire deployment.  It was during a visit they made, special just for us, and everyone who showed up (I think there were five of them, including the chaplain who was a condescending prick that everyone hated) and every one of them felt the need to give a long speech telling us how much they cared about us and were concerned for our well being.  This briefing was conducted from 10:30 am to 1:30 pm on the flight line, under the midday sun, about five hundred meters from our hangar which was relatively cool at all times and had seating sufficient for everyone.  The chow hall's hours were from 11am to 1pm.  Yes, our command forced us to stand in the sun and miss chow while they circle jerked each other about how much they cared about us."

MilitaryStories,2s7mn5,evoblade,10,Wed Feb 11 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"Ain't that the truth of it, though?  That's a lot of story, right there, and I think cuts to the truth of the military.  I can honestly say there were a couple of guys I've known who I wouldn't have minded getting smoked, but at the same time I and everybody else would have gone to any lengths to help them if they needed it.  Kind of a weird dichotomy, eh?   The civilian world is so full of options and hand-holds and cubby-holes that most people don't understand survival, in its most basic form.  Somebody, or somebody's, who have your back and are willing to give up all of their own safety because you're one of theirs or vice-versa.  Makes a body feel tiny and god-like at the same time.  I had a math teacher in High School, probably ninth or tenth grade, who'd been Navy.  He was on the fire response team, whatever the Navy calls it I don't know.  He told us about fire on a ship, they'd had one and a few Sailors died.  I can't imagine how bad a fire on a ship would be, let alone a sub."

Amal is a human rights lawyer, who worked on the Enron case, was an advisor to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected for a three person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award.‚Äù Right?   Sounds about right.   What is it about celebrities that completely dwarf real people and their accomplishments?   I kinda think that for the most part, people who become 'celebrities' are the people who really need other people to look at them, notice them, pay attention to them, obsess over them.  People who become celebrities might do some important work, but that's secondary.  Not that that's a bad thing, but that's how I see it.  That's what comes across, to me anyway, when they're interviewed.  People who actually do things can be the same way, but I think the percentage is much lower.  In my personal experience I've found that the louder about achievements, the poorer the quality.  Craftspersons, whatever their craft may be, tend to let their work speak for them.  I guess I got off topic there.   I mentally practiced looking dignified for my big close up.   That got a laugh out of me.  Also, just as an aside, my comment to /u/AnathemaMarantha on his most recent story reminded me of this.  I can never hear the name Mila Kunis without giggling.

I can understand why she might want sometime to get to know her as she is first, then tell them all about who she used to be. Or maybe it's just a fling, and neither has any intention of it being a deep or lasting relationship.  I still think honesty is the best policy.

The better advice would be to be honest and not date anyone that would reject based on gender change. Why put either party through that.

They're making their physical body match how they are in their mind. It's a big deal for them, and for some bringing up their previous life in the wrong gender can be pretty painful. Not exactly first date conversation fodder.  Yes, I get it, a sex change is a big part of someone's life, and I understand that you personally are probably horribly put out by the idea that someone you are dating could have been the same gender as you.

Those are issues that you are more concerned with.   Maybe, just maybe, someone else would be more concerned with other issues than you such as bedding a former male. Maybe, the guy really wants biological kids one day. That's not a crazy idea. A post-op person can not produce eggs.

MilitaryStories,2s2gzx,Ireadunderwater,99,Sun Jan 11 16:17:06 2015 UTC,"Tote the weary load. Sure boss. But don‚Äôt pile on your personal bullshit.  In James Michener‚Äôs book Caravans, he describes the relationship between camels and camel-drivers. I became familiar with camels and camel trains when my family was stationed in Turkey. They are very smart animals - don‚Äôt be fooled by the dumb, woeful expression. They know what‚Äôs up, and they can calculate their malice down to the scruple.  Case in point: Anyone who has experience with working camels knows that their living souls are in hell on earth. Or at least, they‚Äôd like you to think so. The groaning noises they make as they stand up or kneel back down are long, low and echo the torment of souls in agony. Michener says they make these sad, tormented vocalizations under all circumstances - whether their load is normal, or light, or overweight. Even so, they keep track.  Camels are phlegmatic in motion, deep in meditation, no indication on the road that they are carrying more than their fair share. They make the usual groans as they kneel down to be unloaded at the end of the day. But woe betide the camel-driver who is not fully as aware as his camel is that the load was overweight.   The more experienced camel-drivers know that once a camel who has been overloaded is unencumbered and on his feet, he‚Äôs coming after the person responsible. If you are the responsible person, it‚Äôs best to throw him your coat, or anything else that smells like you. Because the camel is determined to fuck up something that smells like you - he‚Äôs been thinking about it all day. Best to let him stomp and bite and spit on and maybe shit on your coat than the alternative, no?  Evidently, once the camel has stomped the offending camel-driver‚Äôs stink, it‚Äôs all good. Back to work.  So there it is. TSgt DickSuck should‚Äôve tossed you his coat. If you‚Äôre gonna fuck with the grunts, you have to anticipate a camel response. If not... oh y‚Äôknow, payback is a bitch."

Scaring the children - let me tell you, I understand that. Izmir is a seaport in a deep indent in the Anatolian Peninsula made by the meeting of the Meander River and the Aegean Sea. The closest place to cross that inlet for camel trains traveling north or south along the west coast of Anatolia was right along Izmir bay. They were not allowed to use the shoreline road - they were restricted to the second road inland that ran along the bay, and could only travel that road between midnight and about 0400.  That same road passed under the balcony of the bedroom I shared with my brother. We would be awakened by the soft pad of camel feet on the cobblestones, and rush to the balcony in hopes of hearing dreadful news from the camel drivers in Arabic about the scrotum of the Prophet and the prick of Allah, and how those sacred things might be used to torment an ungrateful camel. This was dangerous talk, even in secular Turkey, frightening and exciting at the same time to barely teen boys. We craned our necks and pricked up our ears to pick up the pronunciation and proper emphasis of these delicious blasphemies so vile that they could only be whispered in the dark morning of the city.  Occasionally, the trains would have to pause, and camels would kneel down without the permission of the drivers. There would be a loud exhalation of groans and brays, mixed with the whispered orders and blasphemous threats of the camel drivers. It was a marvelous and ancient sound, as old as the sound of ifrits and djinn herding infidels and unbelievers through the gate of Hell - on a hell-night when senior demons were abed and not to be disturbed.  Ah. Good times."

MilitaryStories,2s2gzx,__PROMETHEUS__,6,Fri Jan 16 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I think the trick to telling a successful story is to write it like you‚Äôre telling a bedtime story to an eight year old and a six year old. Eight year people are logical, but still kids. Six year olds are still in that dream-state where everything is an adventure:  I approached the mysterious white box. It made a kind of humming noise. I carefully pulled on the door - there was some kind of resistance, and then it came open easily! Light! Light streamed from behind the door! How could that BE? I almost shut the door, but I had to look! I peeked into a world - so bright! - and I saw treasure! Carrots! They were golden and mysteriously cold! I snatched some and slammed the door shut! Here they are now! You can FEEL how COLD they are!  This elicits a sneer from the eight year old and a delighted squeal from the six year old. All the best stories do that, especially the ones on /r/MilitaryStories. We are all eight and six still, somewhere in our heads. We just forgot.  Thank everyone, especially the mods, for not yelling at me for wandering off-topic. Not really. This is a military subreddit, but it‚Äôs about stories, too. My camel stories were fun to tell."
MilitaryStories,2s2gzx,AnathemaMaranatha,2,Fri Jan 16 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"I lived in Morocco when I was about six years old and they still drive camels, and sheep, and cows.  Once a week a herd of livestock (sheep, goats, cattle) would come down our street, right in front of our house, and when you heard them coming you knew to get out of the way.  We were about a quarter mile from a clementine orchard, and in the spring when all those trees were in bloom the breeze would pass through there and then hit our house and the smell was positively intoxicating.  And then the livestock would come through, and the clementine blossom smell would mix with the reek of animal shit and the combination of the two is just about the perfect summary of Morocco: unearthly sweetness and beauty mixed right in with the dirty realities of life."

MilitaryStories,2s0swp,EEPowerStudent,10,Sun Jan 11 05:45:55 2015 UTC,"Hawg Notes are so interesting. My Dad was involved in tweaking the Bear. Every once in a while, the AF would move the ""Fail Safe"" line a little closer to Russia, then run an air wing of SAC out to the new Fail Safe just to see what lit up on the Soviet side. Of course spy planes and covert listening sites (like yours) in Iran and Turkey would be monitoring the ether.  They'd send up enough planes to be a serious threat, but not enough (they guessed) to look like an all-out attack. Probably not, anyway. The Russians always responded. No choice, I suppose. That air wing could do a lot of damage, maybe enough to make the flight of all the other air wings a cakewalk. Couldn't take that chance. Can you imagine how infuriating that must've been to the Soviets? No choice. Light up the defense systems. Apoplexy comes to mind. I bet they were mad enough to kill somebody - lots of somebodies.   We had some idea what was going on from Dad's comings and goings. Plus he subscribed to all of those Air Force and Air Power glossy magazines which were run by people to whom OPSEC meant that any info the enemy must necessarily know already was fair game.   What I think nobody in the general public, including Congresspeople, understood is that this sort of thing went on all the time. Our guys weren't sneaking around, they were engaging in naked provocation, designed to scare Soviet generals with our technical capabilities, and infuriate the military units which responded. These were dangerous and volatile incidents. The Russians didn't shoot down Gary Powers and his U-2 because he was scooping up secretsecret information - his route had been crisscrossed and mapped a hundred times before. They shot him down because he pissed them off. They jerry-rigged that rocket in their spare time.  There was a movie in the '50s, The Bedford Incident, that summed up what the worst possible outcome of these games of chicken could be. There were a lot of fingers on the nuclear trigger, not just the President's. The US was very aggressively poking, provoking and yes, intimidating the Russians. And the Chinese too.  I dunno. It worked, I guess. So there's that.  Thanks DB. Always illuminating to get a peek backstage at the Big Show."

I guess. /u/Dittybopper's story-bomb about flying in the bay of a CH-47 Chinook while little sunlit holes appeared through the deck and bulkheads brought me up short. Never happened to me, but I knew there was a reason I hated riding in Chinooks.   1st time shame on you, second time...    Shame on them for the second time, too. I was just so much parachuted cargo tossed out of C-123 or 130.   But it was the third time they were gonna toss me out, that would've been the real shame. The ARVN Airborne Task Force, all decked out in nifty jungle camo and red berets were going to parachute to the rescue of Khe Sanh at the height of the siege. The dropzone was outside of the wire - we were gonna hit the NVA from the rear as soon as we policed up all our guys and gear. Because photo op. Heroic ARVN ATF rescues US Marines!  They canceled that drop. We landed by C-123 on the Khe Sanh landing strip, much to the disappointment of the North Vietnamese Army. See Killer Joe."

Now that I've read it again something clicked about seeing those red bereted AB Viet's once, but before I go on: Did they wear the ARVN Ranger patch? You can see it on my breast pocket in this photo, The 199th was involved in joint ops with the 5th Rangers when I first arrived in country."
MilitaryStories,2rtss7,Dittybopper,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"God, that whole trip was surreal. I was cherry-new in-country. Saw them for a little while, then they disappeared from I Corps. They were a Task Force - diverse units cobbled together. I think I heard some talk of ""rangers."" Might have seen some different colored berets.  Here's what I remember. Red berets. Twisty deep-bush camo pattern, kinda like the one our LRRPs wore, but different colors. Nobody else - not even the Marines - were wearing anything but OD then in early 1968. They had patches, for sure, but I just don't remember of what.  They came up from the south. Our MACV people said they were like coups-are-us down in Saigon. They were spiffy and very clean for commando types. They seemed to jump out of airplanes okay, but I am a lousy judge of that. I was busy being terrified.  Joe seemed to think they fought okay, but he didn't like to talk about it. I got the impression that he felt like if they had anyplace to run to, they would've broke and run from the NVA. The NVA up north might've been tougher customers than they were used to tackling - not like Buddhist monks and political bodyguards at all.  That's probably unfair. It was an hallucinogenic experience for me. I am an unreliable witness. Joe too.  Could have been the same guys the 199th worked with. They showed up, got their picture took and went back south. My ARVNs treated them like they were from a different country, political soldiers from Saigon."
MilitaryStories,2rtss7,AnathemaMaranatha,2,Wed Jan 14 19:10:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, I think I too ran into them on an operation north northwest of Saigon. We were told they were the Palace Guards, what you say about their uniforms is spot on for the one's I saw.   A freshly painted, it gleamed, Viet marked Chinook showed up one morning, landed on the pad and out came these guys who looked like they were going to form up for a parade. Red berets, that same camo you ID'd (Tiger Stripe pattern, and yes our LRRP's wore it too), the whole nine yards plus these bright yellow kerchief's worn as ascots kinda, tucked into their shirt fronts. Every boot spit shined to the nines, not a speck of anything on their uniforms, gear or new M16 rifles.   In come a couple more Chinook's delivering more of the same. Eventually there was a large group of them on the pad. GI's were getting off on these guys, remarks about them making the rounds. They milled around until early afternoon making chow and drinking tea, then headed into the jungle in single file. Nice show, good production values, eye candy for sure.  A bit after mid afternoon they're back, looking a little worse for wear and putting out a nervous vibe. Apparently a shot had been fired while they were out in the bush. In come the choppers to pick them up, gone. Never saw them again but never forgot them either.  Those were not the Rangers I spoke of, those guys were grunts, did okay but it was rumored they had a tendency drop their rifles and exit left when the shit came down. The grunts told me you had to watch'em. But then that might have been the usual GI bull, who knows. They did acquit themselves well during Tet, the 5th ARVN Rangers."

We were in a huge convoy on the way up near Tay Ninh to join up with elements of the 25th Infantry Division and eventually on out near the Cambodian border in the Parrot's Beak/Elephant Ear area. For some reason the convoy stopped and that turned into a very long wait. I had been the passenger on that trip, riding shotgun, literally, my M-79 chamber with a flechette round that I kept pointing to the right front as we traveled. That area behind me is an ARVN compound, for some reason I remember not trusting it and had sit with the weapon pointed their way for some time before saying screw it and got on the radio (my arm is resting on it) and attempted to find out what the delay was. This guy in my unit took the snap, I think I was thinking ""you dufus fuck..."" at about the time the shutter flicked.  The only idea I had was to get this shit over with.

He asked us just what the fuck we were doing the night before, and we explained that we were drunk, and maybe a wrestling match started, followed by escalation to shooting each other with airsoft guns, to ambushing other soldiers with airsoft guns, to the fire extinguisher becoming involved.  Of course we didn't implicate anyone who he hadn't already named.  It was one of those military incidents and punishments that are met with a perverse sort of pride, both by the ones handing out the punishment, and the ones being punished.  Also, he was looking out for us by perscribing corrective action and putting it in writing.  Once we'd signed it we became immune to an Article 15, if the Top or CO decided they wanted to push the issue regardless of his recommendation.  That PSG was a field soldier all the way, no Garatrooper in him."

I misunderstood. I think I was thrown off by /u/all_secure's story about someone getting flushed out of the Air Force for not having a spotless record, even though he had made himself into a good airman. That kind of thinking - that people who never get into trouble must be better airmen, soldiers, Marines or sailors - is not only wrong, it's stupid. Harmful to the military.  Props to your PSG."

While military life is empirically more structured and strict than civilian life, if you didn't have people that have fun, get in trouble, do something dumb, ignore what you've been told, you would also never have people like Einstein, Tesla, Musk, Gates or Jobs. The best leaders and the best ideas come from people that, every once in a while, ignore what they're supposed to do and just do what needs to be done.

That's what happened with us, but we were a completely different unit so I assume they may have been reasons. (One guy showed up a few minutes late two or three times, we were there for PT an hour or two early the next couple of days.)  But nonetheless, you're a good NCO it sounds like.

Long story short, this piece of equipment isn't quite broke enough to warrant the type of money required to actually fix it.

One of the instructors was an officer in the Swedish Navy, and late on one of the last evenings we're lounging around enjoying the sunset when on of these comes creeping into natural harbor of the krag we're tied up to, lowering its ramp onto the rocks. Blank stares as a crewman steps ashore, motions to us and asks ""Want to go for a ride?"".

One of his childhood buddies was one of very few Irish Jews, grew up in Belfast (or thereabouts) in fact.   Well, back in the day there were, more so than now, roving bands of young hoodlums lurking around the streets after dark, looking for members of the opposing faith to bash around a bit. My dad's buddy finds himself one evening unlucky and cornered by one of these gangs, association unknown.   ""Are ye a Catholic or a Protestant?"" the leader of the group asked him, and be glad that you're not being forced to hear my poor Ulster impression.  ""Neither, I'm Jewish! I'm a Jew!"" my dad's friend replied, sure that this would constitute one of the few times in history that anybody has gotten out of a beating with those words, or so he thought.

MilitaryStories,2rl4td,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Wed Jan 7 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"Author's Note  Bad form to comment on your own post, but I've been thinkin':   Strangely enough, the Battalion CO seemed to back off a little after that, didn‚Äôt fly out to see what we were up to. Don‚Äôt know why. Probably just as well.    I wrote that. That's what happened. Why did that happen?  Y'know, it's possible that the Colonel wasn't a pro-active, gung-ho, hands-on commander like the idiot /u/All_Secure described here. If so, why would he let up on us after we put tracers in front of his C&C helicopter? Didn't seem like the kind of guy who would wuss out and bunker-up the first time he saw a tracer.  I'm thinking he was running out of command time. I'm thinking now he was out jonesin' for that damned Silver Star. That's why he was all up in our shit.   If you're a Battalion Commander whose career needs a Silver Star, you need some bang. The Personnel Flunky can't make things up out of whole cloth - S-1 needed something to work with. I'm guessing the Colonel was getting a little antsy as his tour of command approached its end - afraid that he would never have an encounter with the enemy that could be jacked up by his S-1 into a citation that would support a Silver Star.  We did that for him. I'll be damned. All he had to do was fire his pistol out of the C&C, alarming the pilots (who were probably already alarmed) and frightening the door gunners into engaging whatever piece of ground the Colonel pointed at. In command, under fire, rallying the boys and shootin' his pistol - with witnesses right there. That should've done the trick. No need to go out and pester the maneuver units any more.  Never thought of that connection 'til now. Huh. If true, that scenario promotes our Battalion Commander into the biggest command puke I ever encountered. What a fucktard.  But if that's true, it also means our plan WORKED!!! BWA-HAHAHAHAHAHA-AH!!! They said we were BUSH-HAPPY! They said we were CRAZY! Who's CRAZY NOW, BITCHES?  I'm gonna post this now.

The first couple weeks go by quietly and everyone is still feeling him out.  We're stuck at a COB formation in the parking lot waiting on the staff call to get out so we can get our safety brief and go about our weekend of stabbings and DUIs.  We'd been standing in the NC evening sun long enough to start getting grumpy.  Top (6'+ dark skinned Georgia dude) comes out and says, ""Damn, it's plantation hot in this mug!""  Shocked laughter all around. Suddenly it was all ok.  He rushed us through the briefs and released us for the weekend.  After that, he was ours and we were his."
MilitaryStories,2rl4td,SoThereIwas-NoShit,8,Wed Jan 7 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"The First Sergeant in this story was a quiet man. Never saw him yell at anyone. He just kept moving within the company, always showing up just where he was needed. He spent most of his time with the NCOs, walking with them, talking, checking the soldiers out. He seem to know everything - who needed new boots, who had a broken bipod on his M-60, who hadn't gotten a letter from home lately, who had a medical issue that needed looking at, who was having trouble fitting in.  He was a constant presence, a steadying influence. He made the machine work. He had an E-7 Supply sergeant back at HQ who was the King of Scrounge.  Most of the other First Sergeants for our infantry companies spent all their time in the rear area. Our Top was primus pilus material. Caesar would've valued him above his generals.  It is a measure of just how bad our C&C problem was that he was willing to go along with the idea of scaring the Colonel away."

MilitaryStories,2rl4td,djabelek,6,Thu Jan 8 06:40:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. The Major who asked about my Mom. Might as well bring all the bush-happy stories up the timeline and park 'em here. This one was a story-bomb brought about by the sorely-missed /u/roman_fyseek's story telling how he was held captive in a boring place because of his computer skills:   Too valuable to risk - powerpoint guy. If I understand the jargon (and I'm not sure I do), you were being held hostage by your mad skilz. Hollywood made a movie about that - Mr. Roberts. Good movie.   This is something that happens all the time. In Vietnam, for instance, all the fresh-from-the-Academy ring-tappers were sucked into the upper echelons - general's aides, Division G-3. Not a good thing. Yeah, these guys are going to end up at desks in the Pentagon by the time they've done their twenty, but hey... If they don't find out what it's all about, how're they gonna know what it's all about?  Good for you. Good for your First Sergeant. You were lucky. He was a good NCO. I had a similar encounter, so long ago your momma wasn't born yet.  I got sent into the boonies of Vietnam in 1968, specifically the A Shau valley, shortly after I got in country. I had pissed off my battalion commander, and I guess this was supposed to be punishment. Instead it was a relief. I quickly lost all my military bearing - got bush-happy. Stayed bush-happy for about a year - which was hard enough, because there was some sort of unwritten rule that after six months in the woods, you were entitled to a job inside the wire. I declined a couple of offers. I didn't trust myself around brass-hats.  Yet, it was weird the few times I went back to battalion in Quang Tri. I was used to the idea of being harassed and hollered at and chased around by senior officers, but things changed. All the butterbars returning from the woods were treated gently by senior officers, especially those who had combat experience. Same went for senior NCOs. They took care of us, saw to our needs. Spoke softly. I couldn't make head nor tails of it. But it was nice.  After a year I took a little leave back stateside, and then joined the 1st Air Cav. I arrived at Division Artillery, a 1st LT with a year in-country. They felt obligated to find me a safe place inside the wire. It took me a while to pick up on that. As it was, I had no idea what they were up to.  What happened was that they had nothing for me to do. I hung around Div Arty - the Personnel Daddy heard that I had done air-observer, so they ran me over to Intelligence. S-2 had all the air observers they needed, though they tried to make room for me. I did a couple of battery registrations, but mostly I had nothing to do.   And, there was this captain... He kept showing up where I was, talking to people I had just been talking to. Finally, he cornered me one evening in the Officer's Club (yeah, they had one of those).   ""Hi Lieutenant. I'm Captain Soandso. Looks like you're mine now.""  What? Who is this guy?  ""I'm the Commanding Officr of Headquarters Company, Div Arty. And you are my new Executive Officer, and supply officer, and morale officer and officer-in-charge-of-making-sure-everyone-is-doing-something-at-all-times.""  I'm not a very imposing guy. Evidently, I didn't look as bush-happy as I was. This is not something you would say to a bush-happy soldier. I came up with a bunch of solutions to the Captain issue, none of which got me out of Leavenworth in under twenty years.  So I just stared at him, and the Captain said, ""Report to my office in the morning."" I said, ""Nope. Gotta see the S-3. I'll let you know how it goes.""  The S-3 was the Operations Officer, a major who was third in command of Div Arty. I spent a bad night. I was desperate by the time I got into the S-3's office in the morning. I pled my case: ""Somewhere out there you've got a 2nd LT Forward Observer who is miserable, and has all the skills Captain Soandso is looking for. He's been a supply officer. He'd make an excellent morale officer. He'd be a good Executive Officer.  ""I've been in-country for a year. I don't remember how to do any of that stuff. Here's what I know how to do: shoot artillery. Bring the 2nd LT back here. Send me out there. We'll both do better.""  The S-3 looked at me for a long time. First thing he said was, ""Does you mother know you're doing this?""  Oh God. I'm 21. I look about 17. Please don't do this to me. I'm gonna end up in jail. ""She wouldn't be surprised, Sir. Please. I need to get out of here.""  I wish I had a mental picture of the S-3 in my head. I wish I could tell you more about him. He studied me for a long time. Gave me a look like my old Battalion Executive Officer up in Quang Tri, also a major, had given me when I came back from A Shau. I remember that much.  Next thing I know, I was on a helicopter out to Alpha Company, 5th Bn, 7th Cavalry. I was met by their Forward Observer, a 2nd LT who was giddy with excitement to see me. He briefed me as quickly as he could, gave me his maps and radio, and scampered onto the next log ship to go be a supply officer someplace they had an O Club.  I felt like I had come home. Salute to Div Arty S-3, wherever he is, if he's still with us. Even if he's not. Mead for you, Sir. Thank you from 45 years down the timeline. You were a good officer. You did the right thing.  tl;dr A good senior officer or NCO knows what needs to be done, even if it's inconvenient.   The other story that deals with bush-happiness, is not about being bush-happy. It's about the opposite of bush-happy, call it ""bunker-happy."" Killer Joe. I think just the link will do; this one seems to not need any editing that can't be done in situ. It's about polar opposite solutions to the same problem."

I never got a chance to circular file the draft notice. It was yanked from my hands, and every draftee in the barracks got together to compose a suitable response to my draft board.  They sent it, too. I never got to read it. I might have a warrant out for me somewhere. /u/Dittybopper did the sane thing."

Mail was kinda chasing us north.  I didn't have a lady or anything, but damned if I wasn't looking forward to a letter from my Mom or my Sister or any-fucking-body.  We'd had mail-call once or twice or three times, and guys were getting letters from wives and girlfriends and parents.  Our platoon was standing around our Platoon Sergeant and he was just calling names as he read them, and you could feel the electricity in the air.  I said to myself and to one of my buddies, ""I ain't gettin' shit.""    Guy's would read their letters out loud, after they'd sat down and read them once or twice, to their friends.  Later, when we'd settled down in Al Dora, we'd pester Doc about his letters from his girlfriend, and sometimes he'd read them to us, and we'd echo the lovier parts in high falsetto voices and make fun of him because he was lucky.    Back to Diwaniyah, though.  ""Corporal NoShit.""  With a shit-eating grin on his face, waving a white envelope above his head.  We called him a buddah.  He always had an unreadable smile on his face, even if you thought he was about to strangle you.  I remember him lighting me up with that goddamned smile on his face.  He was a good and fair Platoon Daddy, but a mystery, and the size of dude that you know will just break you if you even try.  I got slapped on the back as I went for my letter, and he started laughing.  I looked at the return address and it was the fucking Fort Bragg Credit Union.  ""Are you fucking serious?""  The rest of the Platoon was waiting to see who it was from.  ""Fuckin' bank statement!""    They all started laughing, while our PSG was calling other names with other letters held out, and while I threw it in the burn-pit, unopened, we were all laughing.   ""FCU?  Fuuck youu!""  That was my first piece of mail in Iraq."
MilitaryStories,2rgb6l,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Tue Jan 6 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"Bummer.  I usually expected to get nada during mail call, wherever I was.

Re-writing ""Letters from Peggy"" put me in a melancholy mood. Nice.   Then the medic and him start chanting ""It don't mean nothin', not a thang""   That was a real thing, y'know. The movie people didn't make that up.   Don' mean nuthin' was punctuation for the end of some bad thing. English is great - in any other language, piling on the negatives just intensifies the negativity. Non, je ne regrette rien, the motto and song of the French Foreign Legion, means literally ""No, I don't regret nothing."" Sounds confusing in English, no?  That's because English is mathematical about negatives - if it's in the mood. ""It don't mean nothing"" can mean ""It means something."" Or if you're feeling French, ""It really, really means nothing, please stop talking about it!""  The ambiguity was useful. ""Don' mean nuthin'"" meant ""that guy just got killed for no reason"" and ""His death must mean something, but I don't know what the fuck that is.""  So give your swimmer her due. If her Dear John really didn't mean anything to you, you wouldn't have written about it. You wouldn't even remember it. She gets full props for being a hippie shithead, who had a streak of unhippielike cruelty. She's a confused girl. She elicits a confused epithet.  ""Don' mean nuthin"" is exactly right. If nothing else, it means this: you dodged a bullet there.  Happy Ending. I feel better."
MilitaryStories,2rgb6l,djabelek,10,Tue Jan 6 00:34:29 2015 UTC,"Re-writing ""Letters from Peggy"" put me in a melancholy mood.   I bet. Reading it has the same effect. I really liked it, but I needed to post some happyness to counteract it. LOL   If her Dear John really didn't mean anything to you, you wouldn't have written about it. You wouldn't even remember it.   Nah. I won't say it didn't mean anything at all to me, simply that it wasn't some crazy heartbreaking scene that she probably imagined it would be. I read the thing, laughed. Got a little pissed off at the whole 'college kids' idiocy and the very idea that she'd stop writing simply because they wanted to protest a war.  I didn't dwell on it. Just put it in the trash and moved on. Hadn't thought about that letter in over a decade until I read your Peggy post. Something about that just brought it up to the fore front of my mind. Thanks for that :D   being a hippie shithead, who had a streak of unhippielike cruelty.   Eh, she was a 19 year old girl who was off in college hanging around with a bunch of hoity-toity college pukes who had their heads up their asses. Probably vegans too...  She was, and likely is, still a nice girl. I don't think she meant to be cruel, I think she just got caught up in the drama. It wasn't that long ago, but people seem to forget that in '02-'04 there were a shit ton of protests about the war in Iraq. College kids everywhere were caught up in it, imagining themselves as neo-hippies and Iraq as the new Vietnam. These were the same kids I had seen in high school a year before walking around in bellbottom jeans and sandals. Tye-Dye shirts. Beads around their neck while they listen to Janis Joplin on their MP3 players.  And then they'd rant about how original they all were....  It was like the '60s vomitted and somehow spawned these re-runs into existence in 2003.   Anyway, yeah, the letter was crappy, but I don't define Sally by that one particular moment. She wasn't cruel. Just had a stupid moment. We both grew up. She grew out of the hippie phase. We each got our own lives."

The well preserved remains were found reposing in metal cylinders which are thought to have been used for storage and transport of fossil fuels some 1800 years ago. The remains show clear evidence of ritual mutilation prior to internment. ""It is our opinion that these findings quite well support other evidences of pagan practices at the dig."" Said Professor Drilling MacSluice. ""For instance we have unearthed as yet uncounted tens of thousands of what were termed 'beer cans' during the Nuclear Era.""

The Jungle Warfare School in Panama closed down a year or two before I got to Fort Bragg, but I knew some guys who'd been.  Apparently, while on patrols, troops of monkeys would ambush them from the trees by slinging monkey-shit.  Apparently, the guy's who knew what was what carried extra sections of cleaning rod with them.  They'd remove their BFA and drop a section of rod down the barrel, and the blank round would turn a M4 Carbine into a weird sort of modern-day arrow-thing-shooting muzzle loader.

It was all in the telling, his personality, and in print it wouldn't come off very well. Basically a pet monkey became offended after our man threw him upside a wall and wouldn't let it steal his Zippo. The next thing he see's is a whole troop of monkeys advancing and chittering at him, with intent. The monkey had ran into the jungle and whistled up his extended troop to come and revenge the insult. The monkeys laid siege to the camp, no GI could move around and they had no intention of leaving until Windle was given over to their tender mercy. So the GI's were ordered to assault through them and retake the base, much monkey business ensued and the camp was eventually retaken. But the monkeys would not forget their offender, kept lookouts in the trees around the base, and everytime he was spotted by them they began to gather as they made a huge racket. Eventually the base had to be moved because of the monkey threat. I've always wondered what citations and medals they received from the VC."

MilitaryStories,2rcace,stillline,3,Mon Jan 5 17:49:51 2015 UTC,Yeah but whats the point of stressing you out? Explain like i'm five please.
MilitaryStories,2rcace,Dittybopper,17,Mon Jan 5 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"So that you learn how to deal with the stress and continue operating.  Some people can't deal with stress, or they deal with it by basically 'shutting down' and curling up into a ball and crying.   In the military, you dont have that option. No matter what your 'job' in the military is, there is always the possibility that you'll be in some sort of combat role, or at least a highly stressful situation. You need to learn how to clear your head, understand what is going on, and work on dealing with the problem. You can't suddenly start freaking out or dissolve into a ball of tears.   Now, since nobody really knows how they'll operate under the worst of conditions, basic training does it's best to 'simulate' a highly stressful situation from the moment you get off the bus, and keep that stress on you until you graduate.   That's why you see TI's constantly yelling and screaming at trainees. Is that the most effective way to communicate? No. If they wanted a trainee to pick up their bags and form a line they could very easily say ""Hello everyone, my name is Sergeant Friendly. I need ya'll to get your stuff and make a nice line over here and we'll start your processing...""  But they don't do that. Instead they start shouting from the get-go. ""ALL RIGHT YOU SHIT-BIRDS! Get your crap and get in line!!!"" They make trainees rush to do everything. ""Move! Move! Move!"" Even when their really isn't a need to rush.   They give tedious assignments (like, say, folding underwear into perfect 4 inch squares with all the elastic perfectly straight)  They assign silly responsibilities (like carrying a portfolio with you everywhere you go, being part of the kitchen crew, being part of the laundry crew, cleaning the barracks etc)   They give trainees impossible tasks (like controlling the weather, determining the outcome of events they have no control over whatsoever)  They overwhelm you in every possible way, mentally and physically. And then they spend time yelling, constantly wanting things faster, finding issue with everything (Dust that doesn't exist. Lint that you have to name)  All the while the trainees also have academic things that they have to complete. Memory work (which they can be quizzed on at total random by any TI at any time) and the monotony of paperwork and indoctrination that comes with joining the service.   All of these things come together to keep you stressed out. You begin to feel the effects of stress in your body. Some trainees literally don't shit for weeks. Others lose weight. Others gain wait. Some get very high strung and tweek out. Some get flustered and can't think. Others get irritable. Others dont have any apparent change.   Whatever your response is to stress is, you'll meet it in BMT. You learn to cope, because if you dont cope you'll get recycled until you do. Eventually, however, being completely stressed the fuck out becomes your new normal.   You learn to focus. Do what you gotta do. Getting screamed at by a TI is no longer a shock to the system. It's just another day.   Hopefully by the end of your BMT experience, your coping mechanism has become second nature, so if you're ever out in the field and suddenly mortars start exploding all around you, small arms fire shoots up your vehicle, and your buddy starts screaming for a medic, your body knows not to panic.   Get into a defensive posture, get your buddy some medical aid, identify the enemy and put some fire on them. Yes, your heart rate will still rise. Yes, you will likely still have a major adrenaline dump. Yes, the world around you will still be chaotic.  But you are different. You learned to manage chaos. You know what it is like to be in an impossible situation. You lived in that constant state for months.  So now that you're in the midst of actual stress, you can do your job. You have the tools to get yourself out of a bad situation. You can still think and plan and prioritize. You don't suddenly go blank and start stammering and pissing your pants. You fall back on your training.  That's about the best explanation for it I can give."

Being Airborne, we usually really only had the equipment we could physically carry, at least when we were BlueFor, and we were always with the Infantry on big exercises, so we were pretty Gruntish.  Nothing got the Grunts going like a Body Breach, though.

It was kind of like ""Lord of the Flies: Lite"", and he was Piggy.  It's funny, because thinking back on it, if a Drill would have handed any one of us a pistol and told us to kill him, we probably would have.  The duffel bag was so there wouldn't be any marks.

I tried for a while with Lipshitz, taught him (again) how to break his M-14 down, clean it etc. Encouraged him at the obstacle course. But he was just too weak and only had half of himself in the game. His last day was during our Fire and Movement training, our only live fire exercise in basic. As one of the acting NCO's I ran the course first then was detailed to help by following close behind other trainee's completing the course, my job was to keep them in line abreast. I would walk a few yards behind an assigned individual and keep an eye on the advancing trainee's. One of them was Lipshitz. He was confused as usual, not clear on the concept and at one point lagging behind his group, for safety you are supposed to keep abreast as you progress up the hill using cover and concealment while firing your weapon - squad assault training. I had gotten him unfucked maybe twice already, I admit I was shouting and cussing at him, frustrated that he was such a Sad Sack. About 3/4's up the hill he just stopped and turned around, his M-14 pointing directly at me. I don't think he was even aware of it, he didn't do it out of malice, just had that lost look on his face. I began stepping to the side as I advanced toward him, The ALL STOP signal was blown by a DI. I'm praying for L not to pull the trigger and I was talking steadily at him, calmly now, I wanted that rifle. Before I took a few steps a DI quietly walked up to Lipshitz from his side and snatched the weapon out of his hands and cleared it. The DI then literally drug him off the course by the shirt collar. L sat in the bleachers the rest of the day until the exercise finished. We never saw him again, I don't have a clue what happened to him."

Gunnery Sergeant is a quantum state of NCO - a kind of super-competence that manifests as soon as the second rocker attaches, and leaves when the third rocker appears. It is, near as I can tell, a Marine-only event. I don't think even the Marines understand how it happens.  This is an excerpt from one of my stories, set in the A Shau valley in Vietnam, 1968. First a booze miracle, then a medical one. I studied the saints. I don't believe in miracles - except the ones I saw. I totally believe your Gunny solved your problem, OP.   Plus, I got dysentery the first day. At 5 PM it started raining. Everyone hunkered down. The Americans gathered in a circle and the Gunny reached into the Tardis ruck that all gunny sergeants are issued upon promotion and produced a bottle of Courvoisier Cognac. He put a little in a canteen cup, and passed it around like consecrated wine. We all got a sip. I was cold and dysenteried and I didn‚Äôt really drink, but I remember that sacred cognac glowing slowly down my throat like the war gods‚Äô mercy to a muddy, be-leeched POG. This became a nightly ritual.  (I tried Courvoisier once after I got out of the service. It‚Äôs just as I thought. I don‚Äôt like Courvoisier. It needs leeches and rain, and it should be served in a canteen cup.)  The Army E7 had given up on me in disgust. Maybe the Gunny too. I don‚Äôt know. I think Lieutenant H asked the Gunny to give me a hand. All I know is that after a cold, wet night with three trips to the woods, Gunny had two pills from his magic ruck for me when morning came. He told me to chew them. To this day I don‚Äôt know what that was, but that was the end of dysentery. I didn‚Äôt shit for seven days."

Oh you just slapped that in there to prevent another boring Major discussion.... admit it :P  I know the type. We had them in the Army Security Agency. Our officers were basically paper pushers, filling a slot in our Table of Organization. They did not sport flight suits, they did not know shit about what we actually did in Operations. Ops, of course, was where all the really squirrely top secret codeword stuff happened and it was an enlisted world. With few exceptions and to their credit our officers let well enough alone which was the surest way for them to receive a sterling ""atta-boy"" on their reviews.   We once received a fresh CO into our fifty-man detachment in vietnam, fresh from a tour as an infantry company commander. Gung ho like a mofo, wanted a strac unit, made some disastrous (to us) changes AND stuck his nose into OPs.

MilitaryStories,2r87g3,Dittybopper,3,Sun Jan 4 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"hehe.. ""tin ear,"" oh well, you're fucked at the root then because they, the agency, looked for people with a musical ear for their Morse types. My mistake was passing the Morse Code test during that first week of basic when all the other testing happened. If I had been clever I would have purposely failed it. I did spectacularly fail the language test though.  At AIT for Morse Intercept Operator you had to achieve 18 GPM to pass, I did, but not as rapidly as others. While on Okinawa at Torii Station I got into the swing of things after working the Mission for over a year and was moved into Chicom Diplomatic interception. Those Chicom diplo ops sent on average at 35-45 GPM and some used Bugs to send. At that speed you would be still typing a minute after the code stopped. I could keep up with them until a bug (a type of Morse key) sender came into the game, just could never copy a bug, mainly due to a bug being so arrhythmic and very non music like. Choppy sounding fuckers, and that threw me off big time. Some of my contemporaries did well with that.  Your basic VC Morse op was very slow and plodding, which was at the opposite end of the scale and difficult to copy in its own right (to my ear) because it was so slow. Plus their equipment was generally crude and the transmitter sound god awful, talking squeaks and squeals. So copying with one finger was normal. Clunk... clunk... clunk... open eyes... continue."
MilitaryStories,2r87g3,EEPowerStudent,2,Sun Jan 4 01:26:15 2015 UTC,40-45! nuts.  The fastest I ever copied was 28 cuts in tech school.  We needed 20's to complete the course (which is a good story for me to tell in its own right) and we did the cuts to make the 20's seem slower.  After tech school I mostly copied targets in the 12 range. Your right its not that hard.

As for your flight surgeon... I dunno. There is a pilot-worship cult in all the services, but the Navy and Air Force have it worst. These gallant young men (now women, too) are putting their lives on the line flying those big shiny machines up to shoot down Migs and Messerschmitts and Zeros in man-to-man air duels. Or maybe they're flying off to Ploesti, unescorted, on a mission where they know half of them won't make it back. They deserve a drink. They deserve to get alla girls. Because courage and death, that's why.  Not so much any more, no? But still the admiration persists. ""Live in fame or go down in flame..."" Yeah, no. Do your job. Don't whine when you fuck up. Take your medicine.  (I just read the lyrics to ""Off We Go into the Wild Blue Yonder."" Holy shit. Mirror pose much? I think I finally understand the volleyball scenes in Top Gun.)  I was confronted with a reverse situation once - no privileged treatment to be had for the lowly grunts.  I was (technically) a platoon leader of about an 11 man mortar platoon in Vietnam, 1969. We occasionally had to pull perimeter duty when the CO didn't want to set up the 60mm mortar. Not a big deal. Platoon sergeant supervised setting up our share of the perimeter - put out trip flares and claymores, wire the clackers, and assign two hour watches.   Second watch went to a new guy (FNG) who had, I guess, spent too much time back in the rear area. We were a less sophisticated crowd than he was used to. The upshot is that when his time on watch ended, he handed half a joint to his relief and went to bed. Word of this got around my tiny platoon. Stoned on watch gets really personal in the woods, and all the sleepers who had relied on this guy took it pretty personally. They were pissed. Aaaaand someone was so pissed, he told me all about it.  It was 1969, with Woodstock and all that, but the drug thing had still not seeped down into the towns and suburbs of America. I had no experience with marijuana, but I knew that once you got addicted and started mainlining it, you would be required to live in an alley and pee on your pants a lot. I had upgraded my database in Vietnam - MJ seemed like a kind of sleazy form of beer. We didn't allow beer in the field either.  My problem was that the Army had not updated its database. In the UCMJ of the time pot=hash=heroin=opium=cocaine. So if I bust the kid, he's off to Leavenworth, spit spot. I mean, if he were of any known use to anyone with rank, or if he had rank of his own plus some skill, leniency, understanding and mercy would have rained down from Division HQ - drug education and treatment and a clean record when he was done. But the kid was just a dumbass grunt - no one to plead his case except maybe a Reserve 1st LT who had no Flight Surgeons or other friends in high places. He was toast.  I was toast, too, if I didn't do something about this. Couldn't ignore it. I finally decided I would bust the kid for being drunk on guard duty, and tell him if he said anything other than ""guilty, I would change the charge to drug use. The trouble is, I couldn't rely on this idiot to NOT get all butthurt and whiny and mouth off to some JAG guy, ""I WASN'T drunk! It was JUST a JOINT!"" Which would put me in a bad place.  This is why the war gods gift young lieutenants with old sergeants. I was worrying my ass off about this until the next morning when my ancient Platoon Sergeant brought the stoner over to where I was. He looked awful. ""Sir, Private Toke needs to go on sick call. He fell down. Doesn't need a medivac. He can go out on the logslick, right Private?"" Yep, the Private nodded. That's what happened. He fell onto the leafy floor of the jungle and got all banged up. Evidently a blanket was involved.  Okay then. Just ignore it. Maybe he'd come back. Maybe he'd talk someone to giving him light duty in a place where sobriety wasn't a critical issue. I kind of hoped he'd come back. We were a lot like a street gang in some ways. Once everyone got a shot at you, you belonged.   He did come back. Was a good soldier - one of the ones who got an ARCOM instead of the BSM he deserved. Grunts don't get special treatment, even when they do. So it ever was.  Edit I see I have story-bombed the shit out of OP. I dunno. I think this is relevant to the original post, so I'll just leave it here unless OP has an objection. Let me know. I can delete.  More Edit I have a poor opinion of the elitism of jet pilots. I admit it. I'm probably wrong, and happy to be talked out of it. But I wanted to be sure that no helicopter pilots think they are included as objects-of-rant. While chopper pilots have many of the affectations of people who fly fast-movers, they are in-the-fight. Huge targets, gutsy and amazing flying, fire support, medivacs, gunships - balls to the wall. Amazing. Honorary grunts, as far as I'm concerned. That all goes double for LOH pilots - crazy-ass motherfuckers. Props."

I don't even care if it's relevant to the conversation. I always enjoy your stuff. Tell me a story about a ham sandwich. I'm all ears. LOL   He fell down...   Bwhahaha. Wall-to-wall counseling is the shit. Doesn't happen very often. Isn't needed very often. But it works when nothing else does. We had a few 'blanket parties' in basic for fuckup trainees who would get us all in trouble. My only 'active duty' wall-to-wall story involved a first sergeant. One of my troops got in trouble, so he had to don his Class A's and we headed up to the Shirt's office. There was a small lobby sorta thing. The Shirt's office was on the far left wall, the Squadron OIC's office was on the opposite wall.  The Shirt's door was closed, so me and my troop had a seat on the couch in the room between offices. We saw the OIC come out, cross the room, and he thought it would be OK to walk into the shirt's office without knocking.   He throws the door open. We all get a pretty good glance inside.   The shirt is in front of his desk. A chair (which I'm sure the Airman had once been sitting in) had been knocked to the floor. Shirt was standing up. He had the airman in a standing rear-naked choke. The airman was squirming around, but not making much progress of escape.   The shirt is surprised when the door opens, but he doesn't let up the choke for even a second. He sees the OIC and very calmly says ""Please shut the door, sir. This is an enlisted matter...""  The OIC slammed the door shut, red faced and embarrassed like he'd accidentally caught someone fucking or something. He stood outside the door for a few seconds wondering if he should do something or not.  He decided to go back into his own office and shut the door.   My troop was pissing his pants, seeing as how we were the Shirt's next appointment.   I told him to relax. I wasn't going to let the shirt put a hand on him. As it turned out, I recognized the Airman in the office. He had made our events log plenty of times. SFS had to respond to his base residence quite often due to domestic disputes. The piece of shit was a wife-beater.   Usually I don't condone violence, but on that particular occasion I hoped the Shirt had choked him the fuck out"

As I progressed through your story the thought came ""bet this fuckers a major..."" I believe the reason that particular rank breaks the way it does, in the army anyway, is that achieving the rank of major means you have made the army your career and are committed. committed to rise further or fail. There is a lot of dog-eat-dog competition between you and your contemporaries for advancing higher. With each rise in rank that pressure increases tremendously.

In any event, his home unit, unit commander, wing commander, as well as TACC were all aware of his actions.

When I was doing my navy officer training, we'd have to line up on the parade ground each day for colours. It was boring as anything. But there were a pair of sea eagles that lived and hunted near the base, and some mornings they'd come swinging around over the beach near the CO's house and just glide over the trees. I loved watching them float up there, so at ease with it all. Made me stop caring about bullshit and idiots, and how annoyed I was to be standing there. Seeing those birds could improve my whole day."
MilitaryStories,2qvyef,snimrass,7,Wed Dec 31 12:11:17 2014 UTC,"Raptors.  I have kind of a spiritual affinity for them.  My father told me stories about flying sailplanes when he was younger.  He had an admiration for anything that could soar, and was an amateur naturalist of sorts.  As a young boy we'd be out hiking or canoeing, and he'd always stop to point out the hawks or tell me to ""shhh...."" and just watch the osprey hunting.  His favorite were vultures, though.  Just watching them ride the thermals seemingly effortlessly.  I remember the look on his face when he watched them.  He'd had a red-tail hawk that he raised when he was young.  He said one day it just didn't come back.  The last time we took him for a ""walk"" in his wheelchair, it was fall, there was a big bare sycamore and it was full of vultures settling to roost.  I mean tens of vultures, which was kind of out of the ordinary there.  He was pretty close to death and feeble, but he lit up when he saw them.  There was a burst of life in him for a little while, and we stopped and he just watched them settling in for the night.  In Afghanistan, a couple of times, there was a hawk just circling and hunting, and cruising next to our convoy, and as dumb as it sounds I relaxed.  To me that bird was an omen.  A guardian spirit more than a bird.  Nothing ever happened those couple of times.  Of course, there were plenty of times when there wasn't a hawk, and nothing happened.   Seeing those birds could improve my whole day.   Does mine, too.  Happy New Year."
MilitaryStories,2qvyef,Dittybopper,8,Sun Jan 4 04:17:56 2015 UTC,"white puff of a bottle of foot-power exploding in my ruck...   hehe... Imagine yourself in freefall hurtling toward the earth at 120 miles per hour or so and enjoying it - Thats ""terminal"" velocity for normal human mass in a flat and stable belly to earth position. Or perhaps you're diving at 220 mph if you are in a head down attitude, legs together, toes pointed back and arms ridgely at your side with  your hands cupped which allows presenting them to the terrific wind and and the slightest twitch will alter your ""track"" or direction left or right instantaneously. Skydiving is the fastest non motorized sport on earth.   Ground objects, cars, buildings, lakes, are slowly becoming larger so eventually you check your altimeter and it indicates you are fast approaching 2000 AGL which means it is time to end the skydive and save your life, you are about 3-5 seconds from impact. You reach back and pull the pilot chute out of its stow on the bottom right side of the rig and manually deploy it into the rushing air to begin the parachute deployment sequence. That is the same as pulling rip cord, You then relax into a flat, belly to earth freefall as you listen for all this ""stuff"" to tinkle and flap behind your back. In about a second you glance over your right shoulder to check on the parachutes deployment and see a HUGE VOLUME of SMOKE following you, it seems to be coming out of your deployment bag. Its on fire! It scares the living hell out of you, for a split second, welcome to heart attack city, fear, confusion...  Then your head clears and you realise you've been had by one of the oldest tricks in the skydivers joke bag  - someone, some good buddy on the DZ, prior to your jump, has secretly opened your Main pack tray and dumped a whole can of baby powder all over everything inside before closing it and concealing any sign of tampering. By now your parafoil, your canopy, is open and safety checked (its still streaming ""smoke""). You spend the rest of the way to the ground planning revenge!  The lowest exit I ever did was at 1200 feet. I was jumpmaster on a load of three students, the aircraft an old Cessna 170. We were still climbing to student altitude for students jumps, 2800 AGL when the engine coughed, made a mechanical KLUNG just once, quite loudly, and black oil spattered the windshield as the propeller came to a complete stop. Suddenly we became a high-drag sail plane and sinking rapidly in the air. Rusty, our pilot, calmly shouts me ""Get'em OUT, jump'em NOW!"" as he leans over to open the door while kicking the plane into the proper slip attitude for jumping. In other words he has instructed me to switch to Inflight Emergency Jump Procedure and get the students out of the aircraft as fast as I can. Without going into what was involved in that I got them out the door as fast as I could. Finished with that task I then asked Rusty if he wanted to try jumping with me, to hold onto my rig, he declined (smart fucker) At which point I swan dived out the door head first and immediately deployed my chute. Rusty landed the plane on a dirt road, the students landed all over the place but were fine.   You released a whole dufflebag of stories of of my time skydiving Grinder. Thanks for your paratrooper story, I could read them all day."
MilitaryStories,2qvyef,Dittybopper,3,Wed Dec 31 23:50:43 2014 UTC,"Well, I don't know if you ever read it, but this is my best jump story.    Likewise.  Your skydiving stories are pretty interesting.  I always wanted to skydive, until I'd been in the Airborne for a little while.  I think I'd trust the judgement of a pilot wit ""Rusty"" for a handle.  1200' was my highest jump, and I swear the Air Force dropped us at six-hundred, once.  Everybody on that pass said there was no way it was eight-hundred feet.  We all swore up and down it was six.  It was just over way too fast."
MilitaryStories,2qvyef,nagilfarswake,4,Sun Jan 4 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"And that was an excellent jump story... I remember it.  Rusty owned the drop zone my wife and I jumped at and was an excellent pilot and accomplished jumper with over 2000+ skydives. At the time of the aircraft emergency I had about 300 jumps but had earn Jumpmaster and Instructor status. I did so in order to jump free of charge which cut down considerably on personal parachuting fees. He and I, both being Georgia boys, were pretty tight friends.   Being on board that 170 when the engine blew was a heart stopper, but did not end badly, considering. Rusty's skill in landing the aircraft that day was special. We had to attach it to a pickup to tow it back to the dropzone. I helped him rebuild that engine. The crankshaft broke sending a piston through the engine block.  Rusty is now a commercial pilot and in my view his company and those passengers he flies are in most excellent hands. I would place my life on his knowledge and innate flying skill anytime. He totally saved our lives again one morning when we were taking off with a load of students. We had just lifted off the runway but were only like 30 feet airborne over a treeline when we encountered two A-10 at treetop level coming at us fast at from our 3 o'clock; at the same moment we experienced a bird strike on the windshield, splat!. Without Rusty's lighting fast evasion maneuver we would have died. He immediately dove the Cessna to the ground, leveling at about 5 feet. The A-10 pilots demonstrated skill too as the lead one banked immediately behind us and the other hopped up over us in the wink of an eye, perfect! I witnessed their actions with my balls in my mouth as I was nealed immediately behind Rusty and facing toward our 3 o'clock when it happened. A lot of fine flying happened in the span of about a half second. With zero help from me..."

I can imagine gunners being totally skeezed out, Are you motherfuckers seeing this?.  I was up in RC East, out of Orgun-e, in '09.  RCP3.  You didn't by any chance ever have a Top or Sergeant Major by the name of Pavlick, did you?  I'd love to read this turn'n'burn written out as a series."
MilitaryStories,2qspv9,Dittybopper,6,Wed Dec 31 03:42:04 2014 UTC,"Negative. But that does remind me of a funny story regarding my gunner earlier in this mission.  Like I said, this was in the wee hours of the morning. I think it was shortly after it had gotten dark when this happened.   We were getting all sorts of reports of ICOM chatter regarding our patrol, with talks of RPG and Recoiless Rifle attacks. We were in the middle of a valley, and at one point we were at the edge of a steep ass  mountain side. All of a sudden I hear a bunch of loud bangs on top of my truck. It sound to me like rocks, but my gunner immediately starts screaming ""FUCK FUCK FUCK, they're shooting at us"". Me and my commander were certain it was rocks falling off the mountain, which my gunner shortly found out when he found rocks falling into his turret.  This was our first real ""oh shit"" moment as a platoon, but still to this day I give him shit for freaking out so much. But I honestly don't blame him. We were all on edge for a few days after that mission. Imagine driving through a valley that hadn't seen ISAF forces in over 6 months and hearing about the enemy planning on ambushing you. It was a tense few weeks."
MilitaryStories,2qspv9,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Wed Dec 31 04:03:39 2014 UTC,"Ha I have a few stories like that.  Once after entering a FOB while TC'ing a truck I started to relax,  I didn't know that the gunner was getting a jump start on policing up his area.  He leaned down to grab something and the hatch covering the turret when not in use fell shut behind him.  Fuck me if it didn't sound exactly like the crump of a motor being fired.  Another time once again after letting my guard down entering a fob some smart ass zoomie going fast buzzed us in a f15.  Ill never forget the ripping sound that jet made.  I though I was going to die, as did everyone in my truck.   Funny how that shit works, times I was in danger and should have been scared I was oddly emotionless and just did my job...nerves get fried eventually I guess."
MilitaryStories,2qs475,SoThereIwas-NoShit,9,Tue Dec 30 03:53:05 2014 UTC,"Good one! Karma is a bitch.  On my fourth static line (civilian DZ) I had a most interesting interaction with my chute. We trainee's trained on and jumped ""pig rigs,"" meaning military gear, 28' round, belly wart style reserve.   On that jump I exited the Cessna 182 and immediately went ass over tea kettle, completely broke my arch and tumbled onto my back while the chute began to deploy, between my legs. I watched the whole deployment sequence as all that junk coming out of the pack tray flowed upwards between my legs. I didn't have time to think about what was happening but I remember being flooded with dread. And then I was flipped upright with a speed and force you wouldn't believe and found myself under a perfect chute.  My instructor admitted to enjoying the display I presented, said he had laughed his tail off watching. He failed me on my exit but gave me a pass on my chute handling."
MilitaryStories,2qs475,Dittybopper,2,Tue Dec 30 16:35:16 2014 UTC,"Gahhh!  That sounds awful.    There's a jump scene in A Bridge Too Far, haven't watched it in a long time, but I know that scene.  Shit practically makes me want to start climbing the walls trying to get out.  It was an actual jump by some Airborne unit.    It really trips me out that I don't remember ever seeing anything on my exits.  I know I kept my eyes open, and after jumping was just a dreaded thing, to where I was getting paired with Cherries because I was trusted, I remember keeping my eyes open.  Never once do I remember seeing anything, though.  Not my reserve or my ruck.  I remember looking up after I felt my risers above my head, and watching my 'chute getting drum-tight.  Weird.  I don't even remember one jump, where according to The Gook we were fighting each other the whole way down and stealing air and trying to slip away.  He's told me about it, and I still don't believe him.   My instructor admitted to enjoying the display I presented, said he had laughed his tail off watching. He failed me on my exit but gave me a pass on my chute handling.   Tisk tisk tisk.  ""A weak exit is the number one cause of injuries, Airborne.""  Says the guy with way less jumps.

Just another roll of the lead dice, Sergeant Major. Somebody's got to win every once in a while. Couldn't happen to a better man.  I attended when my own father passed after 34 years in service. I sent him on with the Spartans' message to those they served: Go stranger, tell the Spartans that here we fell and lie in obedience to their dread command.

I have no idea what he flew before he was our Vice, nor where/how he grew up. He might have just been a socially awkward nerd who got wings and didn't know how to interact with people afterward"

It was the rainy season so he was out assessing bridges to see which ones were safe for what.  (He got a warm bed and three squares while dad was starving in the boonies, but I've told that story.)  He was assessing a bridge guarded by Marines.  (Forgive me if I get details wrong.  He's been gone a while so this is not exactly a fresh story, though the heart of it holds true.)  A really nasty storm was (yes, I like parenthetical phrases) blowing in.  Looking at the bridge in question and the swelling current, he (told you so) suggested that the officer in command of the Marine detachment pull his men off the bridge so they didn't die when it washed out.  ""MARINES NEVER LEAVE THEIR POST!"" the officer regurgitated.  Every single Marine guarding that bridge drowned when it washed out in the middle of the night.  Side note: I picked up a utility cover at a gun show when I was a kid.  First time I wore it to grandpa's house, he promptly stripped me of it and we went to Ft. Bragg to get a proper cover.  You know, the spiffy one that looks like a regular cap but folds down to cover your ears.  I guess Marines don't get cold ears.  All the respect in the world to the USMC.

Our joke, when I was active duty, was that they'd send a whole Platoon to inventory a shovel, and send two Joes to pull a freight-train.  Iraq, '03.  I was tasked with going out to BFE to oversee and build a shoot-house for training purposes.  Several low-boy's loaded with lumber came with us.  The lumber, as garbage and shit quality as it was, had obviously been loaded with forklifts.    I bet you can't guess what we didn't have.  Forklifts.  I was talking to the drivers of the 916's or whatever, and here I think is the difference between the Corps and the Army.  I was fed up, said ""Fuck It!  Let's go bowling.""  We put tow straps around these huge banded together bundles of lumber, hooked them to the tow pintle of our humvee, and tried to drag them off.  We started spinning in 4-low, so I told my driver to go back to 2-high, with a running start.  We got that lumber off, just broken and all sorts of fucked up, and the semi drivers were laughing their asses off, as we jerked the ass end of the humvee off the ground.  It was glorious.  Enough lumber survived to build the shoot-house."

They did the same sort of communications intercept as we did but specialized in Chicom Marine targets. They were different, an example is them having full field inspections each Saturday morning and running field exercises periodically. In other words maintaining their Grunt edge.

Glad you enjoyed the story. I figured most people could care less about Air Force stuff. We don't have cool stories about fire missions and recon ops. I didn't know if this one would even hold an audience.  Yeah, we do the science fictiony stuff (when our equipment isn't completely crapping out on us we do pretty well). But it's kind of.. I dunno how to explain. Strange sometime I guess. I'm not sure how to put it.   After my shift was over and I went home (the first night of Odyssey Dawn) I walked into my house, gave my wife a kiss, pet the dog. She asked me how my day was. I just said ""fine"". She asked me what I did that day.   After a short pause I said ""Well... I helped to completely destroy a foreign power's military capabilities, possibly deposed a dictator, and helped shape the future of a civil war that I know nothing about...""  She rolled her eyes at me and laughed. She thought I was joking...  ""Oh, and we had pizza.""  At that she just gave me a kiss and went into the kitchen to cook dinner. I sat on the couch and took off my combat boots and had a cigarette.  I don't know what she thought I did all day at work, but she didn't believe the 'science fictiony' stuff even when I told her.   And its strange balancing things out between work and home. When you deploy and actually go somewhere you sort of get into a deployed mindset and stay that way until you get home, and then have to re-adjust.  It's a lot weirder when you wake up, walk into the CP, spend 12 hours blowing up a small country, and then in a flash you're back home on your couch watching America's Got Talent, pretending to care if Bo gets put through to the next round or not. Then the next morning it's back to tracking strikes again.   No complaints. It isnt a bad way to go by any means. I'd rather be home for dinner any night. It does make you feel out of place every once in a while though.  Anyway, I'm ranting. I'll stop.  Glad you enjoyed it man."

Kinda looses a little bit of excitement when the story is basically ""So, we sent our aircraft to schwack stuff, and then we sat back and watched, talked on the radio, ate lunch and went home.""  When I read the ones about the mud and the leeches there's always that Wow. You were there, man aspect to it. Its gritty and dirty and so very different from home.

Well, that is why everyone else calls you guys the ""chair force"". But hey, the Navy really isn't much better.   When my kid said he wanted to join the army I told him he was gonna be cold or sweating to death, marching for miles with a heavy pack, eating MREs and getting shot at.

I always just thought of officers as a necessity to doing the job, didn't think of them as any sort of gods, nor as people to mess with, we were all in it together. Until, of course, they proved otherwise at which point, just like I'd do anyone, I fucked with them to the degree possible.

MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,evoblade,4,Thu Dec 25 16:34:15 2014 UTC,Majors are just insecure. It is widely accepted that O4 is the most insecure of they officer ranks (note that officer trainees are not so much insecure as scared shitless).
MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,snimrass,3,Fri Dec 26 12:23:52 2014 UTC,"As an officer (when I was in), I don't understand this. Once you make O4 you are set. You can retire as long as you do not commit any crimes that result in a dishonorable discharge before 20 years. I guess people are super worried about their ""careers"" and making flag rank. Plus as on 04 (in the Navy), you are still technically a Junior Officer, so you don't have as many responsibilities, typically."
MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,evoblade,2,Thu Feb 12 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I'm an officer too.I was mostly being silly, but there is some truth behind it I reckon. O3 is when you are pretty comfortable in knowing your job and how to do it. You can get to o4 if you don't fuck up too hard. At O4 is where you realise you're a little fish in a big pool. Promotion is much more competitive.   I'd disagree about O4 in the navy not having real responsibility - it's certainly not that way for us.  So, I was mostly being silly, but I still reckon there's something to it. Particularly with some of the O4s and former O4s (now civilian) that I've dealt with recently."
MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,TheBackfiringVirus,2,Thu Feb 12 19:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well, many O4 have real responsiblity, I didn't mean it like that.

Most officers are outstanding people, usually very well versed in how to use tact and politeness.   Unfortunately the snarky ones who complain about everything are also the ones most likely to slap an A1C with an 'insubordination' charge.   I've danced close to that edge a few times, but no, I've never directly told an officer to ""fuck her own asshole"". Simply not worth it."
MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,Meihem76,5,Tue Dec 23 23:41:25 2014 UTC,Ah so I understand. I'm just happy in my job we can tell people to fuck off within a certain degree. I feel for you!
MilitaryStories,2q7l2n,RIAuction,2,Wed Dec 24 08:25:06 2014 UTC,Agreed. But it helps to remind our wonderful brethren in the Officer Corps from time to time that they may run the show but they'll be facing the prospect of running it alone without the support and cooperation of their enlisted.

I've met a lot more good officers than bad, it just so happens that the bad ones make better stories.   I have seen plenty of officers lose their shit and go completely overboard, and chew out an airman who didn't deserve it. Usually the only thing that happens to the officer is that some other officer will quietly whisper to them ""You were kind of a dick back there.""  If an enlisted member tells an officer to fuck off, even if it was deserved, the enlisted member will usually face a written reprimand, extra duty days, the loss of leave, etc... At the very least a world class ass chewing.   Again, simply not worth it"

I got a strong whiff of diesel fuel and cough drops when those two slid past my eyeballs.   I have two favorite words; ""Kandahar"" and ""Mercurochrome."" Kandahar because if you intone it at the right speed sounds like a scimitar being drawn, it used to be my most favorite word until all the shit went down in the middle east and the resulting too common useage ruined it for me. Mercurochrome just rolls nicely off the tongue to my mind, I like the sound of it. Most of you young'uns don't have a flip'n clue what it is so I'll tell you. It was the Iodine of its day, a topical antiseptic. Every mom had an ample supply of it in the medicine cabinet, a big brown bottle of it with the skull and crossbones on the label. Mommies little Jack fall down and scrape his knee, Jane get a boo boo? Not a fucking problem. Supermom whipped out the Mercurochrome bottle and a Q-tip and swabbed that scrape with ample application. It stung like the be'jeez and was usually a case of the cure being worse than the problem. As an added bonus it was full of mercury. Next weeks class will be on Mom's favorite of favorite's; Cod Liver Oil. Which is probably right up there with (I'm gonna say this one more time then forget I ever heard it...) ""Syrian whisky"" in flavor. shiver...  But then you guys didn't have the option of swilling cheap as dirt ""Ba Moui Ba"" beer did you?

Constantly getting smoked, screamed at, led to cliffs and kicked off of them and then getting smoked for being wrong.  Once I figured out what was going on, and had proved myself to my Squad and my Platoon, I tried to take Cherries under my wing.    My introduction to my Company and Battallion was a Specialist who just looked tired, taking me through all of my in-processing, and introducing me to my Squad Leader, who was a nice guy.  My Squad leader brought me to meet our Platoon Sergeant, who I think just smoked me because I was new, and took an immediate disliking to me.  Then to the First Sergeant, and then the Sergeant Major.  The only thing I could do right was stand at my most terrified Parade Rest and get told how it was, and get ripped up one side and down the other for some infraction or other, and do push-ups, when they told me to."

It was a matter of some concern for the loadmaster - until someone ponied up, they used to joke about how much they could get for a rosy cheeked white boy down in the Izmir souq. Not enough to bother, I guess. I think one of the other options was to throw me out in the first squall in the flight path.   So that seems to be a thing with them - gettin' paid.

He was pretty tiny, and about nineteen or twenty at the time.  Maybe a buck-thirty?  He could barely work the bolt on a 240, and couldn't at all on the M2 or Mark 19.  He wanted to be in the turret so bad, but obviously that wasn't happening.  The ANA gave him those long eyes and coy smiles, and were really friendly towards him.

In a ways its my baseline, unlike most I know how far down I've been and how far I've came back.

I remember literally thinking of myself as a 'Monster masquerading as a person.'  That girl at the front gate, that I wrote about, and other things, ate away at me for a long time.  It was like everything re-set after Afghanistan.  I thought I'd be good, because I'd been through it before.  I was so wrong.  I started spiralling hard a month or two after getting back from that, to the point that I felt I was going insane and in such a dark place that I was either just going to shoot myself in the head.  I figured I'd do it in the back yard when my girlfriend was away, and call 911 first, so she wouldn't have to see the leftovers.  That was when I got serious about going to the VetCenter.  It couldn't hurt, right?  It couldn't make things any worse.  It helped so much.    This place, writing some of this stuff, has really helped to regain a perspective that I was missing.  Those things will never go away, but understanding why and how has helped.  Writing it seems to cleanse, somehow.  I don't know how or why, and I don't really care, because it works.  I appreciate everybody who reads my stories, but there's another component to telling them to those of you who understand on the deepest level.  I don't want people to be able to truly understand these things, but the ones who do, it's a sort of confession or exhalation.  As I move farther and farther away from it, It gets better.  I know it'll always be there, waiting to sneak up on me, like that panic attack and almost complete breakdown last spring, but at least I know if I can't fight it, I can keep on humping until the weather gets better.

MilitaryStories,2pxr23,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Sun Dec 21 23:51:35 2014 UTC,"Writing it seems to cleanse, somehow.   Writing has done that for me also and is the reason I continue. I was reluctant to post this story fearing it would be misunderstood. Which I am sure it is by a lot who've read it. But then I have reaped a wonderful reward in our having this discussion and I am very glad of that. ""Monster, meet Grinder, he's got your fucking number asshole.""  One morning, when all of it was pressing me hard, instead of heading out of the house I waited for my wife to depart for work. I then took out the parts and assembled this little 380 Sig Sauer I owned. I normally kept it disassembled just so I wouldn't use it on myself in some broken moment. I put it together in a sort of daze, kind of on automatic, I felt flat, had no real feelings, just me and the task at hand.   I got it together, worked the slide a few times, snapped it, then loaded it. I thought of where to put the shot, temple, the forehead, in the mouth, up through the tung into the brain? Somehow it was a difficult decision, I put it to my temple and tried to figure the right angle, it wasn't possible to truly know so I tried it in my mouth, then under the jaw. The mouth method seemed best, but it was very uncomfortable and ruff on my teeth too.   Eventually it ended up lying on the bed and me just sitting there, shit flowing through my numb brain. I don't remember thinking on anything of any import, I just didn't want to move, I had no energy, couldn't seem to summon enough will to do anything but sit. Several times I lifted the pistol, went through the ""position tests"" hoping to discover the surefire angle. But I remained indecisive. Many hours later I was still sitting on my ass, to this day I remember nothing of what was on my mind. I just remember feeling as if I were being crushed under a tremendous weight.   Eventually I put the popgun away, I decided to go have beer instead. Counter productive, I know, but you have to be alive to enjoy it.   So yeah, I understand. Writing it helps, having someone who had been there helps too. Suiside is a shity way to express yourself anyway."

But now I remember another, bright day in March, one of those dry Colorado winter days of bitter cold and bright sunshine throwing sharp, dark shadows behind the cliffs and mountains and the dormant foliage. I malingered until I was home alone that morning. I had a gun, too.   One morning, when all of it was pressing me hard, instead of heading out of the house I waited for my wife to depart for work.

That's exactly what happened. I didn't have to assemble the pistol. I remember being astonished that I couldn't kill myself. Ashamed. You killed all those people, and you can't kill yourself? Coward. Then I went numb, I remember coming out of it in the Psych ward of the VA hospital. Coward. First word I said to myself. I wished I was still numb.  Am I the only one here who actually killed some kids? Didn't want to, but that didn't stop me either. They all look like kids now, even me.   Well fuck. I gotta go reread some of my stories now. First day of Winter. This must be lance-a-boil day.  Last night, we had a Solstice party. My two daughters were there, one with fiance in tow. They're fine, healthy, beautiful. I would have shot both of them with the same bullet that went though my head. More murdered children.   You stopped, man. Took me longer, but I stopped too. Everything we have, everything we are, all the beauty we see, all the beauty we make is undeserved and we are unworthy of it. But still it flows upon us and through us, a blessing that, for some reason, only you and I and few select others can see. I do not envy those who receive these things as their just desserts, something owed to them for being upright or righteous or I can't imagine what. Not me. Not us.   Glad I was there last night to see that, to see those two people I refused to kill. Glad to see you here today, DB. That's all I got."

She was a 9/10 on the Army Scale, and a 7 or so on the Civilian Scale.  Battalion Staff wanted to go check out an area that was really active before we got there.  It was winter, or early spring, so there wasn't anything going on.  She was in our truck, Three-Six's truck, and I was on the gun.  She was sitting in the RTO/AG's spot, just below me on the turret.  Her head was about waist level to me, and about eighteen inches away.  You can understand what I was thinking. Just even having a female voice, and you could smell her shampoo and whatever else.

Apple was in the HHT of the Cav squadron that was on my base in Bosnia.  She was probably an IRL 5, but a deployment 7 or 8.  Short, brunette, and, in BDU's, a bit square.  TBH, I liked her hair up in a bun, more than I liked it down.  I don't remember how we started talking, but I'm guessing that it was when I was at work - I was a mailman, and everybody at my camp eventually came through my door to see me.  In a small camp, we were bound to run into each other again, and, we did, and, younger, fitter, /u/brokenarrow had his ""A"" game, and we started hanging out.  I don't even remember how or where we started hanging out outside of my work, but, eventually, the conversation turned to sex.  PFC Apple had a boyfriend at another camp, and was jonesing for attention.  They were in the same troop, but, for whatever reason, his platoon had ended up at a different base camp, and she had needs.    Young me was tempted, but, one night, Apple told me that she had herpes, and all bets were off the table at that point.    Give credit to Apple for being up front about it, and, who knows, maybe she was just telling me that to put me off, but, I don't think so.    We kept talking.  We shared, ahem, grooming tips.  We shared bedroom stories.  We went to dinner together.  She hung out with us on my bunk in our GP Medium on movie night.  We were BFF's for a few months.  One night, apparently, I was passed out in my bag, my hand on my nuts, and she came by.    One night, she knocks on the tent door, and I'm half passed out in my sleeping bag, alone in the tent, for once.  I think that everybody else was at dinner, or thereabouts.  I met her at the door, and, it was that moment.  Nobody else was around, and, Apple made ""those"" eyes, and I looked down at her (she was incredibly short, even in boots), and, the boyfriend thing at the other camp thing ran through my mind, and the herpes thing ran through my mind, and, I couldn't do it.    I friendzoned myself.    It was never quite the same after that.  Apple eventually hitched a ride over to her boyfriend's base camp, where she put to good use many of the tips that I had given her (at least, that's what she told me, afterwards), and, eventually, she and I got into a fight because...  I'm not even sure why, but I remember that I felt like the victim, somehow, so, I probably started it.  While I know that I did the right thing, by not being a field boyfriend and picking up the herps, the story still sticks in my head for some reason.    Thanks for the reminder, OP."

MilitaryStories,2pt7f3,All_Secure,16,Fri Dec 19 18:47:19 2014 UTC,"Works both ways, OP. Sometimes the people who are poorly dressed got reason to violate the red line. I‚Äôm gonna story-bomb a little:  In Vietnam 1968, Highway 1 was just about the only paved road in I Corps - the area between Danang and the DMZ. It was some general‚Äôs pride and joy, that little bit of civilization and unbumped ride.   The pavement was guarded, too, not so much from the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese, but from the Americans. No fuckin‚Äô tracks allowed. Not armor, not cavalry, not Engineers, no kiddin‚Äô, no shit. Very clean and nicely dressed MPs were stationed every few miles to make sure that didn‚Äôt happen. I think their orders included the phrase ‚Äúall necessary force.‚Äù  I was with an armored cavalry troop. We were on the wrong side of Highway 1 when another troop in our battalion motored into some deep shit. We could hear all the ruckus on the Battalion freq. We were told to move to assist, max speed.   You can see where this is going. Compared to the MPs, with their shiny helmets, shiny boots, starched uniforms and clean web gear, we looked like so many gang-bangers.. There was going to be a clash of cultures worthy of Ferguson. But with a happier ending.   We needed to go about a mile up Highway 1 and cut right to come up on A troop‚Äôs flank. It was the fastest way. We ran into the MPs about a half -mile in - two jeeps with M-60 mounts and an angry staff sergeant standing in the middle of the road with his arms folded.   My CO, a 1st LT (not sure he was even wearing insignia), stood up on his M113 and ordered the E-6 out of the way. ‚ÄúThis is a flash priority move [ongoing combat]! Get off the road.‚Äù The second track in line aggravated the issue by pulling off to the side of the road, degrading the barrow ditch, and - just coincidentally, I‚Äôm sure - putting himself into an effective firing solution for the MP jeeps.   I have to say, the MP gunners on the M-60s did not twitch. Neither did the M-60 gunners on the tracks, nor the two .50 cal gunners in our M113 turrets. Some of them were grinning. The MP Sergeant did not move.  It‚Äôs an interesting experience to be muzzle-sighted by American soldiers. I‚Äôm happy and proud to report that they looked like they meant business. Don‚Äôt know what we looked like to them, but I‚Äôm guessing there was some pucker. Didn‚Äôt show. Good for them. They acquitted themselves well. I write these things with mixed feelings, even now - I can still feel the shot-group lined up on my forehead.   But they needed to move. I was listening to the radio as all this was going down. Much boom and bang. We needed to scoot. I yelled as much at the CO, hoping maybe it would hurry things along. Not so much.  Our CO jumped down from his track. First thing he said to the MP Sergeant was, surprisingly, ‚ÄúGot a paper and pencil?‚Äù   Y‚Äôknow, now that I‚Äôm writing this, I think that defused everything. The Sergeant uncrossed his arms and fumbled for paper and pen. Our CO scribbled something, and handed the paper back to the MP Sergeant. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my name and our unit. That‚Äôs classified information. Report me to your superiors. Now clear the road or I‚Äôm going to have to run you over.‚Äù  The CO hopped back up on his track. The MP Sergeant moved to one side and had his men stand down. They looked disappointed. So did our guys. Crazy.   Not a real story - no ending. We arrived at A Troop‚Äôs party too late to join in the festivities. The hors d‚Äôoeuvres had all bugged out, died or were hors de combat by the time we showed up. Aw. No US casualties. Yay. Didn‚Äôt have to feel bad about not crunching the MPs.  They must have started re-paving Highway 1 the next day. It was all smooth and pretty the next time I traveled down it. In a jeep.  I apologize again OP. But if you‚Äôre gonna tell stories about blue-on-blue violence, these memories just pop up. Thanks for you story. What is it with majors, anyway?"

To grease a pair of headsets you awaited your opportunity by keeping surreptitious eye on your intended victim and when the moment came rub carbon paper on the sets. When the victim next put his headsets on he would sport large black circles immediately in front of his ears. No one would tell him of his new clown look, he had to find out for himself which usually meant him rubbing the area with his hand and discovering the ""Mark of the Fish."" You'd been ""fished"" in the sense of falling for one of the oldest known practical jokes at ops. To manage to grease a supervisors headsets was to become a God among mortals at ops, your stuff didn't stink and you had proven it beyond any doubt.  One always checked for carbon paper marking upon picking up any headsets, it was automatic to do so.  Good story OP, thanks!"

MilitaryStories,2pniz4,Dittybopper,4,Fri Dec 19 02:57:47 2014 UTC,"This route clearing reminds me of Camus's novel The Myth of Sisyphus. In other words it sounds absurd, never ending and doomed to those involved being ambushed at will. Reading your stories the thought too is rising in me that the Taliban were onto an effective strategy in keeping an army's resources besieged on the roads, the exact known place you can harass and harry them. This trudging up and down the roads constantly sounds like ducks in a shooting gallery.  Helicopters damn it, climb aboard and fly over all those IED's, go kick some IED planter ass. Use that SIGINT, those gunships and artillery to keep them off balance. Take the initiative and not allow them to call the shots on where and when the fight happens. Abandon those FOB's and COP's which require so much support and road clearing. A FSB can be built in a morning, operations begin soon after if not during. As an armchair general I demand it. I also realize I wasn't there and that I am probably missing the point, and info on the ground situation.

MilitaryStories,2pniz4,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Thu Dec 18 21:09:34 2014 UTC,"This is true. Who decided that OP and his men should go naked into death? For what reason?  Camus wrote that the correct response to necessary absurdity - the task of Sisyphus - is not suicide, but revolt. Soldiers assigned an absurd, impossible, deadly and unsupported task cannot, in honor, revolt. So the suicides proceed at an accelerating pace.   I've just erased three angry responses to the OP. There is a blood debt owed to the elite units who undertook these idiot tasks better suited militia and police, assigned to them by arrogant political hacks, chickenhawks and profiteering corporations.   In 1972 or so, my younger brother went to his father and told him it was time he served. My father - who retired after 34 years in the Army, then the Army Air Corps, then the Air Force, as a bird Colonel - told his youngest son, ""They're not going to let you win this one. Give it a bye.""  Can you imagine what it took for a man with that history to say that to his son? I bet you can. We're back there again. Not because of fumbling politicians who didn't know any better, but at the behest of people who promised that the oil wars would NOT be another Vietnam, that it would be a cakewalk, that there would be honor for the soldiers and a more-than-tidy profit for their corporate buddies. This from an administration run by a malingerer and loaded with chickenhawks and corporate buttboys.   See what I mean? I can't write about this without breaking posting rules. Apologies to the OP and the mods. Delete this if you have to. I think it needs to be said.  And enough with the despair and suicides. You are not suffering from PTSD. You were betrayed. Take a Sisyphian satisfaction in your service if you can, but remember the second half of Camus' advice."

As much as we knew we were looked down upon by the Active Duty guys, when they saw our unit patches at the big bases, we also knew that the ones we worked for were grateful.    For what reason?  Our RCP never had a strike to our six.  Not one.  Sometimes we found them.  Sometimes we soaked them up.  Sometimes we missed old ones that weren't operational.  But we never had a strike behind our element.  Grunts in up-armored Humvees who would have been smeared all over their truck, ANA and ABP (Afghan Border Police) piled into the beds of pick-up trucks, Local Natioanal truck drivers just trying to make a living doing an honest job, none of them ever got hit when they were following us.  As far as the big picture, well...It was stupid and made no sense.  I'm okay with having done our job, even if it was pointless on the grand scale.

If you can muster it, you will have achieved a mature, adult, profound and generous peace of mind that is beyond my comprehension and abilities, even at my advanced age. It may be that the volunteer soldiers and Marines of modern wars tolerate meaningless and mindless neglect, too often inflicting a mortal cost, better than the volentold grunts and grunt-like people I served with. So be it. Sounds like a positive development.   Sorry I got so angry and butthurt all over your OP.

We Get Blown Up, So You Don't Have To."", was kind of a floating joke among us.  Most of those fuckers couldn't even read, but they weren't stupid.  They knew how to hit us, and we knew that they knew.  Things like mine rollers came down the pipe-line, and soon enough they'd just off set the pressure plate from the charge, so that when the roller hit the two hacksaw blades they'd initiate the charge under the truck itself.  Cents and a little ingenuity to defeat money.  That roller of mine that got blowed up cost $600,000 dollars an hour for the four hours I had it.   Take the initiative and not allow them to call the shots on where and when the fight happens.   That was exactly what wasn't happening, and you could feel it.  Everybody was so frustrated and pent-up.  You heard about those guys that went rouge and killed ""civilians"", I'm sure.  My guess is that they got so sick of ROE that they said fuck it, and went and hit those motherfuckers.  Thanks for reading."

Excuse me while I have a fucking aneurysm, I've go taxpayer dollars spinning in my eyeballs. I haven't had a close look at one but I doubt there's $5000 worth of bulk obtained materials and fabrication to one.   Sounds to me as if the mine roller was an outsource item, perhaps something supplied by contractor such as KBR or Haliburton. Is that true? If so then what other equipment was handled that way? I wonder too what the vig was once it was junk, bet there was some outrageous cost for returning damaged goods. This sounds like insanity and  I may sound calm but I'm far from it."

No, it wasn't rented, it only lasted four hours.  I remember one of the contractors showing me the invoice for it.  The thing was articulated, hydraulics and whatnot, but didn't run off of our truck other than electrically.  No PTO, just a control box in the TC seat.  The company was R4.  The blown up ones just went back to be canabalized, like some of our trucks.  We all lived, except for Sergeant Adams, and it was the equipment that kept us that way.  It was stupid and it was a waste, but the one thing that all of the shitbirds who had us there did was to throw money at it, and that money got us good equipment, and that equipment worked most of the time.  The policy didn't, at all, but that's a moot point.    Welcome to Nation Building and COIN.    ""See those fuckers on the ridgeline, in civilian clothes, with PK's and Ak's?  They're friendlies.""  ""How do you know they're friendlies?""  ""'Cause we can see them, and they aren't shooting at us.""  I know this joke has been told, at some point, but that was what it was."

MilitaryStories,2pfm60,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Tue Dec 16 03:51:39 2014 UTC,"I felt really bad. It was just expected and normal, for us. You didn't have to say anything, because everybody just knew. Why wouldn't they know?   Because officer. A commission makes your brain go AWOL. Things that are as real as death become part of an abstract puzzle that you have to solve - figure it out, make it work. You have to disassociate from all that grunt rumble and bang, just to do your job. But that kind of thinking also makes you forget that you're actually present and in the game - the piece of the puzzle that is you is actually in play along with all the other pieces.  I was always doing math and on the radio to the battery - pacecount, land navigation, marking rounds, available guns, fire missions. I can't remember all the times I was pushed around, moved aside, told ""Sir, we need you to move back now,"" or just pushed down into cover by exasperated squad leaders and platoon sergeants. I even got run over once.   One of the idiot duties of senior NCOs is the care and feeding of a Six, not to mention random other officers who wander into the battlefield. I'm not sure it's a duty - god knows, there are plenty of officers to go around. But it is a courtesy. As soon as I noticed that I had been moved, I was embarrassed, then grateful.  Can't imagine what an AF officer would be thinking about in a situation like that, but I will guarantee that he didn't consider that there might be danger to himself, because, y'know, he wasn't really there - not officially.   So I imagine he was, like me, embarrassed to be caught out thinking like a goddamned officer, and was (eventually) grateful that the same NCO god that looks out for fools, drunkards and the United States of America, was looking out for him, too. If he wasn't grateful, he shoulda been. I am. Thanks for taking the time, Sergeant. Deeply appreciated.  No reason in the wide world for you to feel bad, OP."

It was a bombed out plantation house surrounded by jungle, some of which was growing in the building. Naturally the TOC jocks got the part that still had a roof. My partner and I made out by stretching two of those useless ponchos overhead. That is also the place where the landmines were discovered the next morning. Otherwise, like your grandfather, we lived in the bush. Typically we'd set up in a clearing or field but sometimes a blown out spot in the jungle. Armed camping I called it. Many years later my wife and I were once preparing for a hiking/camping trip in the Wind River range in Wyoming. We had just bought new backpacks and i was showing her how to pack her ruck.

Start from the beginning: Okay, it's war. The comic books and video games don't seem to cover how important shitting is, how nobody seems to deal with the details of that predictable daily body function, how improvisation is the mother of torn T-shirts. War is hell on earth. Plus it stinks.  Got it. We are far from heaven.   And we suffer here on Earth. Again the movies and comics and video games never get this right. Grit, heat, bumpy roads, savage slug-buggery. We struggle through pain. Struggle to get where? The Eye in Heaven knoweth all. A place is prepared for OP.  Yea, strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:14) But school yourself to the will of Heaven, and heaven ye shall find.   Tell it, Brother OP:   I see the palms lining a drive and the eucalyptus in rows and the way they have that fragrance in the dry heat of summer. There were apple orchards in neat rows, and pomegranate trees, and grape vines, and other fruit that I have written down somewhere. I think in all, we worked out eight different fruit varieties growing in abundance. This place was untouched.    Yea, the scent of heaven is lovely, and the fruits of the Lord are sweet and healing to those who suffer and struggle and find the Way.  And behold, in our Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. (John 14:2). So what if you have to clean up a little leftover shit? It's a just metaphor, damn it! For all the sins of mankind going back to Adam, don't you get that? Quitcherbitchin'. Just clean it up and you'll be fine.   And then.... we're back to shit. What is this, a Buddhist parable? Reincarnation back into the place we started? Jeez, OP, then you just HAD to mention the bisected 55 gallon drum of jet fuel or kerosine or gasoline mixed in with the primal goo of all mankind! Jesus, Mary and Joseph, in Vietnam everything smelled like burning shitcans! Little plumes of black smoke everywhere! Now I've got that stank in my nose!

While the day sucked due to workload and non-functioning equipment, the night really began to suck because the temperature took a nose dive as soon as the sun set.

Sounds like your infantry were in tip top shape here Grinder, the spear tip honed and stropped to a satiny bright ""Follow Me"" killing edge. Not yet dulled with use, fresh meat, so no excuses for them not improving their lot by their own hand. They were simply not up to it, lack of imagination I guess. Plus, I know too that they are all fear crazed from their extreme regimentation.   Guys like Rad are invaluable, that is how our unit ended up with two Jeeps not listed in our TO&E (Table of Organization & Equipment) along with extra generators and various other amenities. Out in the field I was constantly begging, borrowing or outright stealing materials to improve my teammates and I's existence. Little shit mostly, stuff to reinforce our fighting/sleeping bunker or something to keep us drier or put between us and the ground. We lived pretty primitively for the most part, not far, say about a dimes thickness, above the infantry. The artillery sites were a prime source if you could sneak off with something, but don't get caught. Most of the time they'd gladly give you their excess but it was always a dilemma whether to ask or just take.   Nice raid on the AF there buddy, shows initiative, and smarts. The command wonks weren't interested in commandeering my teams shit but I have witnessed that happening. Ah, tent cities, the field equivalent to transit barracks, waiting, bored, often either too hot or too cold. Sucked.  Liking your story bro.  PS: Spooning. Dad and I were on a deer hunting trip in north Georgia once, camp was about three-quarters up Springer mountain. Wasn't much to it, basically a campfire with sleeping bags lain out on the ground. It had been pretty nice weather for mid November, but the second night we had a storm blow in, the thermometer dropped, the wind began blowing through the laurel pretty strong and gusting much higher. So strong we had to extinguish the fire to keep from burning the forest down. It was dark as midnight, no heat, no light, we decided to bed down. My bag was like an icebox, it was one of those cotton things from Sears, cheap, shitty, dad had one just like it. I laid there and shivered, my teeth sounded like they were powered and on automatic they chattered so. Finally I worked up the nerve to tell dad I was freezing. He admitted he was too and suggested we get into the same bag and put his, a bit larger, on top of us. We did, spooning the only option, it got a bit warmer for us. We survived the night but neither of us got anything like enough sleep. The next morning at dawn we braved the below freezing temp and wind, dressed and got the hell off the mountain. spooning can save your life."

It provides insight and fleshes out what it is really like on deployment.   If you are around the infantry you soon develop appreciation for your own situation and respect for the 11B's. By far they had it the roughest, always, and were just worn down with responsibility, used unmercifully. Their life was one of constant duty, endless patrols, sweeps and guard duty, digging in (and out), maintaining weapons, trudging out on ambushes, manning listening posts - fighting!. Scrub brush, jungle, swamp and river delta always in 100+ heat and humidity, or rain during the monsoon. Little opportunity to bathe, few breaks of any sort. If they managed more than three hours of sleep a day it was a remarkable event in their lives in the field. Just as you say they lived like dogs for the most part. Perhaps they were just too damned tired to spend energy improving their lot when they had the luxury of being in one spot for any length of time."

Didn't know it was supposed to be a factory field stripped MRE.  They had ""sandwich"" things in them, which was pretty cool.  The motivating factor behind eating the First Strikes was that they were new.  That's it.  The sandwiches were pretty okay, and they had caffeinated gum in them, or maybe the caffeine gum came from somewhere else.  Drivers and Gunners were usually on a mix of Rip-It's, caffeine gum, and whatever those fucked up GNC energy pills were called.  Not Stackers, maybe Stackers, I don't know.  Whatever they were, four of those motherfuckers washed down with Rip-It after Rip-It would keep you up and alert on the hours and hours of slow route clearance.  Hydroxycut!  Lots of Hydroxycut.  First Strikes.  I don't know.  They were like a shitty MRE that you'd never had yet, but more convenient.  No bag of stew to fuck with and try to eat in a truck rocking like a boat.   This is a terrible description of a First Strike.  Some smart sonnuvabitch figured out how to sell new MRE's on a gubmint contract, and got rich doing it.  Honestly, they were worse than MRE's, and after the newness wore off, nobody would touch them because they were just horrible and disgusting.  MRE's really aren't a bad deal.

That's for real the way it works. That's what salted American soldiers sound like, how they deal. There's still a lot of ""Yes Sir"" and ""No Sir"", but y'know, if you're a platoon sergeant and an experienced E5 digs his heels in and won't obey orders, you don't start yelling about court martial. You go see what he's on about. Because that's what you trained that E5 to do, and you know he's not just throwin' shit on your stripes for no reason.   That's the way I saw seasoned American infantry work. The tactical situation was a big puzzle - it was everyone's job to solve it. It wasn't a parade field - rank doesn't just mean you get to march in front. Rank means that it's your job to get the right answer, and use all of the tools at hand, including - especially including - your junior NCOs.  People imagine toy soldiers let by some puppet-master martinet, and echelons of NCOs shouting senseless orders that must be obeyed without question.

Perfect.  I never had a pointer. I did have a horse who was more or less on constant alert. It was his opinion that checking out whatever had got his eyes bulging and his ears up and rigid was my job. Mostly - oh, pretty much all the time - it was a false alarm.   Which was okay. It was annoying when he'd go all strained and goggle-eyed at the only yucca in the corral. I'd yell at him to cut it out, but he never did. He'd just roll one eye back at me, I swear, boss, somethin's there! Just go look! We won't KNOW fer sure until you go look! I went to look. He was so grateful, plus I owed him. He wasn't wrong all the time. I would've missed a golden eagle mantling a cottontail, and few other things that made the bother all worthwhile.  Anyway, I knew plenty of people in the Army who were asshole or idiot enough to kick a dog on hard point. I don't remember any of 'em in the field. I'm guessing they didn't last long if they were dumb enough to leave the wire. I bet that's still the case.  A good infantry company is like intelligent quicksilver flowing downhill. It breaks into curious, prying pseudopods. You can block some of it, but a droplet will get behind you, then the part in front of you will rivulet out and around, and join up with the droplet and suddenly re-integrate into one larger unit big enough to fuck you up. And when you turn your attention to that threat, here comes the other pseudopod that you had pinned down. Then the whole thing flows together, and you've got an infantry company way up into your shit.  Martinets like little rectangles - some with infantry X's, some with cavalry /'s, some with a too-drunk-to-stand E - with little flags on top, one for company, two for battalion, etc. They bump the little rectangles together at military school and go ""pew-pew"" under their breaths. The rectangles never talk back. They just follow orders until an unlucky roll of the dice removes them from the map, all neat and tidy.   I loved being an E-5 with a team.

I wasn't that alert when I was in the field - I was on the radio a lot doing math, listening to my rounds. More than once, I was startled away from my maps and compass and radio by a hand on my shoulder pushing me down to a less exposed posture. I'd turn and see a squad leader at the other end that arm, not even looking at me, staring into the the jungle, making flicking gestures with his other hand that sent grunts snaking out through the bush, gonna go look on the other side of the yucca.   now I'm gonna keep Bird-Dog in the back of my head, ya bastard.

I have a buddy who served as one of the targeters for the B-52 strikes inside VN, we've often discussed how he arrived at assigning his targets. Mostly it was radio intercepts, DFing and photo recon with some eye's on reporting thrown in by units such as the Long Range Recon Patrols, the LRRPs. Want to know how you ended up eating MREs? Those were developed during the VN war as LRRP rations and those eventually replaced the old C-rations.  I'm still trying to figure out what it was y'all were doing over there. Remember my remark ""...that's a leadership issue."" It was and I stick with that, but I didn't take it high enough, the lack of leadership was originating in the White House first of all and the Pentagon second, with the State Department being the State Department and confusing both. A theater commander and his staff can't issue effective ground policies if they aren't receiving direction from the bosses. ""What the fuck is it we're supposed to do here?""

MilitaryStories,2om5cy,Talo998,4,Tue Dec 9 02:18:17 2014 UTC,"The BDA after the B-1 strike, what was found?   We found a little scrap of t-shirt.  We found left behind stashed water bottles, some still full, and pissed in them and put them back.  Bomb strikes had happened up there, but we could barely even figure out where they'd hit.  The country there was hard, even going up and looking over an area that we'd saturated with fifties and mark-19's and 203's and SAW's and M4's, and looking at the terrain, you wouldn't think anything had happened if you hadn't seen it happen.  Supposedly air assets had killed some people, but Muslims make body&parts and wounded recovery a priority.  Have to respect that.  We were looking for blood stains and trails, but we didn't find anything, other than that piece of a shirt.  Supposedly the bomber was killing them, though.    I think the only bodies that ever got left behind were when they got killed in or inside the wire, and I wasn't there for those.  That was the second (and last to my knowledge) time an element from our Company had been involved when a B1 had been on station.   I'm still trying to figure out what it was y'all were doing over there. Remember my remark ""...that's a leadership issue.""

In other words it was all a muddle and you guys received it loud and clear, and acted on it, just as it was sent. FUBAR may apply here.   Maybe I was used to it.  The best example I can think of was Iraq, August or so of '03.  Remember Muqtada al Sadr?  Our Third Bn was just outside of Sadr City.  About that time he'd put out a statement, maybe a Fatwa, I don't know, about killing any American or Coalition soldiers who came into ""his"" area.  Rumors started coming down about our Brigade going in a clearing out the whole fucking area.  Maybe they were rumors, but they seemed like the true ones, not the bullshit ones.  I think Sadr was behind the Mahdi Army that became a huge problem later, but maybe I'm mixing that up.  Anyways, we were excited about it.  We were ready to go in and fuck them up.  It was supposed to be a Battalion for the main effort, one in reserve, and one acting as the cordon around Sadr City.  It may have been enough of not-a-rumor that we actually started prepping for it.  I think I remember us getting ready, but maybe that's just how I remember it.  What came down, though, was that it took a Presidential order to take down a religious or political leader, and that it had been denied at the highest level.  That was really the tell, to me.  We were already fighting with our hands tied, and here was a sonnuvabitch, with a huge following, who'd publicly declared that his followers were supposed to kill us, and we weren't going to take him and his people down.    Yeah.  That's as true as I remember it.  You read that right.   Bet your balls were tingling as you went through that entrance armed with a pea shooter.   Fuckers didn't have body armor, and a pistol was faster on the swing.  Ten feet max distance?  Other than the fact that I hated that piece of shit, it was a better choice, and I actually had a sidearm in Afgh.  It was my go-to the couple of times we got into huts and buildings.  Hoo-boy!

The flash and pressure wave generated by the grenade explosion would cause the C-4 in the mine to ignite. The payload in a claymore are several hundred approximately 30 caliber steel balls. Quite a bit larger than BBs. What I don't quite understand is how the pin on the grenade was pulled, those things are pretty hard to pull, some force had to be used such as jerking the container (ruck) up off the ground which in effect created a large Bouncing Betty type mine, perfect for killing and wounding a lot of Joe's. Just a strange accident all the way round. I think the fates were in full cry during this one.

They've never aged, or perhaps it is us who metaphorically stopped aging. I tried to put them to rest, age them and quiet them, to tell myself they are truly dead now and their sounds, and the fury, long lost.

Well, that's what I thought, too. There was a big argument among the blues. Some people were pretty sure that a claymore couldn't be set off that way.    The payload in a claymore are several hundred approximately 30 caliber steel balls. Quite a bit larger than BBs.   I've seen a claymore broken apart - ""BBs"" is too small. They looked like rows of those little steel ballbearings I use in my wrist-rocket slingshot to kill skunks and squirrels - but never feral cats, because cats are wovely and sweet and purring and cat people go batshit crazy if you do that. I always thought of them as BBs, but yeah, they're actually pretty big. Could be .30 cal.   What I don't quite understand is how the pin on the grenade was pulled, those things are pretty hard to pull...   That part we figured out. After his first firefight, every grunt became aware of how hard it is to pull a frag pin - can't do it with your teeth, like in the comic books. They all came up with the same solution - bend the pin tines inward. Frag inspection was regular thing. But it was one of those ideas that everyone got, and then didn't think anyone had ever had before, so why not? Why, indeed?   some force had to be used such as jerking the container (ruck) up off the ground   Yep. Wasn't the dropping of heavies that did it. Someone tossed his ruck on a bush or something, then decided it need to be heaved over there. Got fragged by a crunched bush, we reckoned.   I think the fates were in full cry during this one.    Oh god, yes. I've got a little list of fates I need to talk to. They never would be missed.   we living can still smell the fresh young blood   Oh you had to go and say that... I spent three long paragraphs on the smell of warm blood mixed with fresh, loose shit. I swear, we have receptors high up in the pharanx that - if you're lucky - never fire. But when they do...  The first time I smelled a dead human, I knew exactly what it was. I had smelled dead and rotting animals before, but this particular smell caused a dormant receptor to fire, and suddenly in the cockpit of my brain, what I thought was an inert row of lights and warnings began flashing - Bad things ahead. Turn around. Bad news, danger, nothing edible. Turn around. No one was more surprised at my certainty than me.  The third paragraph of ""Bad Cess"" - where I'm talking about a lead weight crashing through me - was where the blood/shit smell hit. I think we have dormant receptors for that, too.   I wrote quite a digression on that - then re-read it. Gross. Even for me. Edited it out. Seemed pretty over-the-top.  Now, reading what you wrote, that edit seems disrespectful of those ageless young men. I hope not. So when you talk to your ghosts, please talk to mine, too.

Okay I pinched them out of the ammo bunker at our compound on Long Bien while on a Stand Down. Figured I could use them more than the fellows in the Det. Never did use any in anger, thank the saints. I did open all the little black containers, contemplated squeezing the cotter pins closed a bit but decided against that and put them back in their containers. I thought too about attaching a few to my web gear but again thought better of that, so left them in the case and in the Jeep trailer. I kept an arsenal in that trailer.

Mr. Grenade is Not Your Friend  If grenade mishaps can be lighthearted, this would be it.  I actually met this guy dad served with.  He's one of the big, perpetually happy guys.  I'll call him Pvt. Polack.  He was Polish and loved Polack jokes.  His brother would send him regular letters with the latest joke he'd heard.  I don't know the exact details of the ambush, but dad's platoon really stepped in it.  It was, quite literally, an uphill battle.  Practically had to be a mountain goat to move around.  Pvt. Polack lobbed a grenade in the direction of a spray of tracers.  Mr. Grenade is not your friend after the striker goes ""pop.""  The grenade promptly bounced right back down on Pvt. Polack.  He realized his mistake and tried to dive away.  For his trouble, he received an ass full of shrapnel, a couple of weeks in the hospital and was the butt of company jokes for the rest of his tour.  The way dad tells it, he was laughing as medivac dusted off.  Cuddling With Rockets  One of the few times dad's unit spent any time on a firebase made him pretty shy of them.  Dad's memories are fuzzy so this isn't much of an account.  The firebase was not infrequently the target of random and, usually, ineffective rocket attacks.  Sometimes they were more effective than others.  One of the more effective attacks occurred while dad was at the firebase.  The place was getting shredded, and everyone was running for whatever cover they could get.  Dad sailed into a bunker just before a rocket did the same.  They dug him out of the rubble and found him with the dud rocket resting across his chest.  Good old Army.  They did CPR to get him breathing again, sent him to get checked out and sent him back into the jungle.  Thanks, as always, for the story."

That's called sympathetic detonation, and I've seen (heard, really) it happen at demo ranges when we'd put charges too close together.  Just in case you were still wondering.  A lot of people have a lot too say about how military demolitions are initiated (set off), and usually they're wrong.  It's all about the pressure.  A hand grenade (Composition B) could definitely initiate the C4 in a claymore.  Even your WHAM!BANG! describes it perfectly.  Comp-B making a slower pushing thump and C4 making a faster sharper pop.  Ditty with his Grunts claymore getting set of by radio...We also learned electrical initiation systems, never used them but once or twice, and that was why we'd shunt the leads, twist the exposed ends of the wire together if they weren't actively in the blasting machine.

If the troops aren't aware of the larger goals that their individual missions are in support of then how can they know what they are supposed to be doing, accomplishing? In VN the overall mission was to attrit the enemies ranks through constant patrolling and attacks. In retrospect that was a failed policy of Westmoreland's when the emphasis should have been on COIN, but it did provide a easily understood doctrine. I think the 11 ACR's motto said it best ""Find the Bastards and Pile On!.""  ""...was a known, sizeable enemy presence, and other than dick around for a while and maybe take a few rounds, we did nothing.""  WTF? Risk aversion? In a military in the field? Lack of aggression leads to just what you fellows received, constant IED's, rockets and mortars, ambushes from a distance then vanish style attacks. Sitting ducks and the Tally had the advantage of picking their fights.

MilitaryStories,2o4f58,AnathemaMaranatha,2,Sat Dec 6 01:53:39 2014 UTC,"/u/Dittybopper was in a more occupied area than I was. My Rule of Engagement was ""If you're shooting at me, I will kill you. God help the innocent bystanders around you, because I sure won't.""  I have to suppose that in more civilized areas of Vietnam, there was some prohibition against randomly shooting up the civilians. I dunno. I was mostly in what they called ""Free-Fire Zones."" We could call in arclights - might not get one, but nobody would question your sanity if you thought one might be useful. I will concede that sort of behavior around villages of people whose hearts and minds were still winnable miiiight be seen as contraindicated. I admit that reasonable people can disagree about that.   But damn, you and Ditty seemed to take it more personal.   It is personal. Where we were, the tactic was to put American units, company size or smaller, out in the bush where they could be overwhelmed by superior numbers. We were bait. When the NVA or VC took the bait, people like me were supposed to bring the rain down on 'em. We had lots of rain.   I'm with the Big Bopper, Daddy of Artemis. No way is it right to send you guys out there in a foreign country on foreign turf for a ""fair fight"" - gun to gun - with the locals. I want it to be horribly unfair, a massacre. Send Apaches, Warhogs, TAC Air, artillery, the IRS, Congressmen and all the horrors of the US of A to slaughter them and terrify their genes yea unto the seventh generation. Don't want to be their friend. I want them to remember why it's a really bad idea to fuck with me, even if I look like easy pickings.   I want that for your guys too. The military will fuck with your life plenty - no need to invite strangers to the table.   I just deleted a whole couple of paragraphs of rant. Thank you for your service. It was harder than mine. I think you should be given a zillion bucks and a couple of congressmen to clean your kennels. This is fucked up. DB is right. You are owed big time. All of your guys are owed.   And whoever loaded those mortar rounds should have his ass kicked. That's owed too."

I don't get that bullshit of hardly ever having air or artillery support, things in vietnam were pretty much always arranged so the troops had that, at least one or the other. Very often both. What the fuck!?   ISAF.  International Security Assistance Force(s?).  Everybody but us and EOD fell under ISAF, and of course SF fell under whatever the Secret Squirrel rules were.  It was, still is I guess, a NATO peacekeeping force.  Their ROE specifically stated that they were not  allowed to initiate contact unless they were fired upon first.  Even if they had eyes on.  What the fuck?  To the n-th degree, my friend.  We only got AWT once when we weren't in contact, at least I don't think anybody was, but I also have no recollection of getting rocketed that day and according to my buddies we did, so who knows?  As far as Arty, there were certain areas without overlapping fields of fire, so sometimes we just weren't in range, but again, we'd get denied if we weren't actually in contact.  No prepping targets, no recon by fire.  We got around the recon by fire rules by doing test-fires, because we were allowed to do those, and if we just happened to ensure that our crew served weapons were functional in the general direction of where we thought there might be Taliban, well, you know...Oops.  Our bad.  It was fucking stupid, but it felt like a fucking free-fire zone in comparison to our ROE in Iraq."

""...tricking the Taliban into blowing up one of our trucks.""  Funny stuff, hooah. A line from Blackhawk down... No, the NVA let us roll through, we knew something was up because of the way the villagers acted. I got ready to react but nothing happened. A nice village too, and old old one, wealthy too. We convoyed six hundred yards or so out from it and set up a fire support base. Then the shit hit the fan for five days. This was known as the May 5th Offensive which followed Tet68. Those NVA were bivwhacked in the vil and on their way into Saigon. Our coming through probably stunned them and I know that building the FSB on their (and a lot of other NVA units) route really pissed them off."

One day, someone was talking on a walkie-talkie, and apparently the CSM was listening in and didn't approve. What followed was a two-minute ass-chewing at that individual, delivered over the battalion local comms channel. There wasn't much actually said, because sometimes it took thirty seconds to get a single sentence out.  One of our squad leaders was a real smart-ass. A moment later, I hear ""AND THEN..."" in what was apparently a spot-on impression of one of the characters from the Ren & Stimpy cartoon.  ""W-W-W-WHO THE FRAK WAS THAT! LAST STATION, I-I-I-IDENTIFY YOURSELF!""  ""I DUNNO.""  What had been a directed two minute ass-chewing turned into several times that, as our CSM promised all sorts of dire, painful and career-ending consequences if the perpetrator didn't identify himself right this instant. Of course, it's hard to single someone out for punishment if they don't identify themselves, and the staff sergeant who was screwing around on the radio darn well knew that.  In the end, the only thing that happened was the CSM made it very clear during the next morning brief that anyone caught screwing around on the radios in a combat zone would be getting an instant field grade, or more if he had to track them down. Key word- caught."

MilitaryStories,2nry0e,Dittybopper,1 point,Sun Nov 30 23:30:46 2014 UTC,"I looked through that manual. Our phones had a big old Ma Bell circa 1954 receiver with a push-to-talk button. It had two terminals to attach a split landline, a canvas case and a recessed crank. Supposedly the landline was more secure than radio. I dunno. Seems like anyone with some electrical tape, a wire stripper and a stolen phone could tap right in.  We didn't have a terminal. I didn't see anything like what was had in the manual you linked to. That looked like newer stuff. I'm thinking our old field phone cranks are not the only old cranks who are part of this here conversation.  Those fancy new phones ain't so much. I mean, can you knock somebody unconscious with just your phone receiver should the occasion arise? Our old ones were good for that purpose - much more adapted to that purpose than, say, actual communication.   I feel old, old, old...

In the detachment we had a weatherproof briefcase that contained our Field Phone tapping equipment. In it was a Nagra tape recorder, a length of thin two-strand twisted weirdly cammo colored wire. Each wire had a  mini phone plug on one end and these fine needles terminated each wire.  The infantry was supposed to report any commo wire they came across so we could sneak out and tap it for hot skinny. The drill was to post security a ways up and down the wire then tap in the middle and run the wire back to cover. It was known that the VC regularly ran wire security checks, meaning a two man team trotted along their wire checking for just such shenanigans as described. One of the VC would have the wire in his hand as he walked along, feeling for any bumps caused by something like thin tapping needles might leave."

All of that saliva that starts running?  You don't breathe through your nose, but through your mouth.  Shallow breaths through pursed lips using your spit for bong-water.  Let it dribble and run everywhere, and don't breathe deep.  You can still say your name, rank, and social.  Then you get out of the chamber and the cadre says, ""Damn!  That shit doesn't phase you at all?"""

MilitaryStories,2nfnbd,fatimus_prime,11,Thu Nov 27 04:42:50 2014 UTC,"I've only been through the chamber twice as an LT, but I can verify the number of retard LTs that lose all their shit the moment the mask comes up. I saw an LT freeze after lifting his mask and didn't make a sound, didn't move, nothing. He just stood there and grimaced until one of the CBRN guys granted his arm and pulled him out.  The best show is OC spray though. As an MP Lieutenant , we get the pleasure of experiencing OC (aka Pepper spray or Mace) during BOLC (or OCS). And then every time your Soldiers are sprayed, you're expected to go through it as well. So if you ever want to see an LT lose all common sense, run around like an escaped mental patient, cry like a baby, curse the high heavens and then pace in a circle sobbing and crying for the next hour, that's where is at."
MilitaryStories,2nfnbd,R3d_P3nguin,11,Wed Nov 26 03:02:13 2014 UTC,"I remember when I went through the gas chamber in basic I was kinda anxious about ripping the mask off and all that...  After it was over and I was out in the fresh air me and my buddies thought it was actually fun. We wanted to do it again.  Years later when I volunteered to help the XP Cadre I learned that the gas was really not that bad. Yes, it burns a little, but not horribly. Yes, snot comes out your nose. Other than that it doesn't do much. Me and the XP guys used to walk around in the chamber in our BDU/ABU's with no mask on a pretty regular basis. I think the gas chamber, like so many other things, is mostly mental. If you go in knowing it isn't that bad it doesn't seem that bad. When you are anxious or scared or freaking out I think the effects are multiplied simply because of the mental state of the person.   Of course, on a few occasions my wife came stumbling and coughing out of the laundry room asking what the && was on my uniform shirts. I'd throw them in the washer with no problem.  So maybe it has something to do with building up a tolerance as well."

We only let him slip away... out of kindness, I suppose."" You were a Federale in that guy's story, OP. A kind one.  Saw little fragments of some story all the time. I remember standing in muck with my recon sergeant on a hot sunny day cussing out our PRC-25 because it had got all filled up with swamp water and wouldn't work. An old man in black pajamas was squatting nearby watching us.  When I finally started yelling about DXing the radio into the swamp, the old guy stood up, walked over to us and said, in perfect BBC English, ""If you do throw it away, please tell me where.""  We just goggled at him, then told him sure, we'd do that. Then he walked away. I don't think he wanted our radio so much. I think he wanted to fuck with our heads. Did too.  I can hear the stage directions: ""Soldiers enter stage left."" ""Soldiers exit stage right."" And they exit, wondering wtf that was all about. Some other story. A tragedy? A comedy? Happy ending? You'll never know."

Was he a doctor or professor before?  Seen that in Iraq.   I can hear the stage directions: ""Soldiers enter stage left."" ""Soldiers exit stage right."" And they exit, wondering wtf that was all about. Some other story. A tragedy? A comedy? Happy ending? You'll never know.   The most hilarious tragedy ever written.  We are actors.  We enter, and exit, over and over, and your farmer watches us rotate through.  He watches his fields burn, and his children die, if he lives long enough.  He gets ground between Us and Them, all the while just trying to live a life.  I think the happy ending is when somebody wins, it doesn't matter who.  Like /u/jb0356's farmer in the last part of his story about a terrible day.  I'm sure he didn't really care who killed who.  If his crops didn't come in, they were going to have a starving winter."
MilitaryStories,2n2729,AnathemaMaranatha,7,Sat Nov 22 20:30:02 2014 UTC,"The most hilarious tragedy ever written. We are actors. We enter, and exit, over and over,   We are parvenus. The Theatre Maistro catalogued the cast of characters over 400 years ago:  ~  All the world's a stage,  And the men and women merely players.  They have their exits and entrances,   And one man in his time plays many parts,  His acts being seven ages.  At first, the infant,  Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.  Then the whining school boy, with his satchel  And shining morning face, creeping like a snail  Unwillingly to school.  And then the lover,  Sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad   Made to his mistress' eyebrow.  Then a soldier,   Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,  Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel  Seeking the bubble reputation  Even in the cannon's mouth.  And then the justice,  In fair round belly with good capon lined,  With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,  Full of wise saws and modern instances;  And so he plays his part.  The sixth age shifts  Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,  With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,  His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide  For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,  Turning again toward childish treble, pipes  And whistles in his sound.  Last scene of all,  That ends this strange eventful history,  Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.  As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7   ~  I salute your entrances and exits, OP, nobly told, as I await the Last Scene of All and Mere Oblivion. Somehow telling the story seems more and more important as other things slip away - teeth, eyes, taste, everything."

Instead, take a bite out of the hardest action movie speech ever written (leaving out the beginning and the end that give it away):   In peace there's nothing so becomes a man  As modest stillness and humility.  But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,  Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;  Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it  As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base, Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.  Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit  To his full height.    Think of a half nude Ahnold riling his Hyborian troops before tearing into the enemy.   I love Shakespeare, you just have to forget that it's Shakespeare sometimes."
MilitaryStories,2n2729,kombatminipig,3,Mon Nov 24 09:44:04 2014 UTC,"Think of a half nude Ahnold riling his Hyborian troops before tearing into the enemy.    Well, no. Conan was more moral a leader. If there was any such speech at the siege of Harfleur, it was probably shorter and more to the point: ""Loot! Gold! Women! Goats! That way! Let's go!""  The guy giving this speech had a pretty grim estimate of the same troops he was inciting to fury and glory two scenes earlier. I like this speech. Shakespeare says rather too much about war leaders. They like to shift the blame around. The city should surrender, or what happens to them would be all their fault.  Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves,   Or like men proud of destruction,    Defy us to our worst.  For as I am a soldier,    A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,      If I begin the battery once again,                     I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur      Till in her ashes she lie buried.   The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,     And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,    In liberty of bloody hand shall range     With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass        Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.  What is it then to me, if impious war,      Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,        Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats       Enlink'd to waste and desolation?              What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,     If your pure maidens fall into the hand       Of hot and forcing violation?           What rein can hold licentious wickedness     When down the hill he holds his fierce career?     We may as bootless spend our vain command      Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil        As send precepts to the leviathan              To come ashore.  Therefore, you men of Harfleur,     Take pity of your town and of your people,    Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;     Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace        O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds        Of heady murder spoil and villany.      If not, why, in a moment look to see         The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand           Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;   Your fathers taken by the silver beards,               And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,     Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,       Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused    Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry      At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.         What say you?  Will you yield, and this avoid,        Or guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?       ~  ""Guilty in defence,"" huh? A very cynical speech. Took some courage for a playwright to put that speech in a revered King's mouth. No wonder the enemy considered him no better than a pirate or condottiere.  How can you not love Shakespeare, if you love the English language? He made a huge chunk of it up out of his own head. And he spoke truth to power in a time when that was a very dangerous thing to do. That courage also was inculcated into the English language and culture, and our Anglophone cultures too.   I love Shakespeare, you just have to forget that it's Shakespeare sometimes.   Hate the pedants who hold him captive. What is it them to them if they raise generations to hate their linguistic roots? Forget English lit.   Remember Shakespeare. He helped build the parliamentary chambers in which all modern English is spoken. Some of your freedom to speak is due to the fact that - unlike most of his contemporaries - he was not a willing bootlicker."

Plan an escape.   Absolutely.  The stables were open, though, and we only kept the shithead prisoners permanently zip-tied, with sandbags over their heads if they were being especially dumb.  Our Ba'ath Party man was educated in the west, and he knew how we were supposed to treat prisoners.  The hayseeds would sometimes start crying or pissing and shitting themselves when we rolled them up, because they thought we were just going execute them.  He also knew that if he tried anything stupid he'd get shot, because we told him as much.  The area where he prayed was only ten or fifteen meters from his little circle of concertina, which he had all day to look at.  He saw more going to our slit trench or the shit barrel.  Stables were an ""unclean"" place to pray, since he was Muslim.  He knew if he didn't follow the rules, his life would get worse than it was, and if he did follow the rules, we'd treat him like a person."

MilitaryStories,2n2729,Dittybopper,3,Wed Nov 26 18:33:02 2014 UTC,"And eventually what happened with this man? One always wondered their fate.   While I never had any close contact with prisoners a lot passed through some of the places I was at. Mostly they would be brought in off of some operation or another, they were never treated bad by us, or I should say U.S., that I witnessed. That was left to the ARVN. Blindfolded, hands and arms bound they would sit there in groups, squat there I mean. Mostly they were eventually choppered out. Sometimes they were subjected to a field interrogation by an ARVN interpreter. Young and old, there never seemed an in between among them, odd. The interrogations always went the same, one man standing and spewing a stream of high-pitched sing-song, the other squatting and either talking or silent. If talking the other listened, if silent the prisoner was threatened, slapped, hard, sometimes kicked or beaten. But never within our sight, the beatings took place offstage. Unless the interrogator become excited, I remember one doing that, getting really worked up and jerking his 45 and slamming it sideways across the man's skull, blood slinging off the gun. The guy fell over, out cold. That really pissed the interrogator off so he drug the fellow off by the leg. Out of sight.  My understanding is the prisoners were always turned over to the ARVNs for whatever happened next, I further understood that meant execution for some. After Tet68 there was a flood of them, you'd see companies of them, more even, on Long Bien squatting in the sun awaiting their fate.   Thanks for your story Grinder, I wonder what your man is doing these days."
MilitaryStories,2n2729,illuzion25,3,Wed Nov 26 02:11:38 2014 UTC,"Cadet, huh?  That's funny.  We always called them Dimehead's, or Cadidiot's.  Prisoners.  Eventually I'll do a whole post about that, maybe.  There were rumors in Afghanistan about the ANA dealing with them.  One time, after an IED strike and we found another while we were un-fucking the situation, some of our guy's rolled up a couple of Afghans.  Their hands tested positive for explosive residue, or fertilizer (go figure, they were farmers and it was summer), and word came down to turn them over to the ANA that were with us.  I was on the turret at the time, and watching the side of the road that they were all on.  It was a place where we weren't going to take any direct.  It was all pressure-plate IED's down there.  I was smoking and pretending to pull security, and watching the ANA with their new prisoners, two or three ""fighting age males"".  One of the ANA, obviously somebody with rank, was making gestures and yelling at the prisoners.  A light slap here and there, and then talking to another ANA.  I couldn't hear anything, they were 100-150m away.  Then about a squad of ANA and the Guy in Charge started pushing them down to the ditch at the side of the road and forming a line behind them.  I got on the internal comm's.  'Holy shit!  I think the ANA are gonna execute these motherfuckers!  Can any of you see this?!'  To be honest, I didn't really care, and I was actually a little excited as much as I was feeling that awful dread.  It wasn't like I was going to do anything to stop it, or call anybody about it.  As far as I was concerned it wasn't on our hands, and fuck 'em anyway.  I wasn't the most compassionate person, then.  What does that make me?  Anyway, the ANA in charge, after his squad had formed up behind the guys in the ditch, looked around and I could see him talking with his hands.  He was talking to his squad and pointing at us, and to the prisoners.  The prisoners climbed out of the ditch, hands zip-tied behind their backs, and started moving towards a small abandoned building further off the road, with the squad following them.  I was relaying a play-by-play to my Driver the whole time.  They all disappeared behind the building, and I was waiting to hear the report of Kalashnikov's.  They were back there for a while.  I was rapt.  I was watching a drama play out to the sound of an idling diesel and the glink! preceding radio traffic and the sound of the gears of my turret motor.  Eventually the prisoners came shuffling back out from around the far side of the building, followed by the squad.  They were walked down the route, and loaded into one of the Afghan Army pickup trucks.  I would imagine that whatever happened back there wasn't good, but better than what looked like was going to happen.  We never knew where they went after that.   And eventually what happened with this man? One always wondered their fate.   I assume he's been dead for a while.  He was one of the higher-up's in the Saddam regime.  One of the families behind the sub-station we guarded made it to Canada, but the father is dead.  Killed.  After we left, we heard that many of the people who were our cleaning staff were killed.  ""Angela"", the girl I'd paid twenty US dollars twice, most likely one of them.  Our interpreter had multiple attempts on his life while we were there.  The people up at Margah, in Afghanistan, who we abandoned to the mercy of the Taliban.  All of them saying, ""Why are you leaving?""  I think we left a wake of ghosts behind us."

MilitaryStories,2mtvnt,brokenarrow,4,Thu Nov 20 04:47:01 2014 UTC,The struggle is real for the junior LCpl in the shop.
MilitaryStories,2mtvnt,heathenyak,7,Thu Nov 20 04:53:39 2014 UTC,"In that month on duty, I almost set some woods and a humvee on fire. In mid November, it was starting to get pretty cold during the nights on watch, so they parked Humvees at the locations that were the most exposed to the elements. We were allowed to sit in them but instructed to, under no circumstances, start them up. MCAS New River is (as the name implies), on a river. One of the sentry posts was out on the tip of a peninsula that juts out of a pine forest into the New River. The winds there are swirling, and it was always real cold, but at that post they gave you NVGs and once they parked the humvee, it was relatively peaceful and secluded. Oh, this was one of only a couple posts that had 2 men posted, and that's a huge selling point, because almost all the other ones gave you no human contact for most of the night.    Our instructions were to watch the river for amphibious assaults. We weren't the smartest bunch, but we were smart enough to know we were about 12 miles inland, and that any invading force that got to us would have had to go past and conquer Camp Lejeune, the largest Marine Base in the US, boasting around 50,000 Marines at the time. If the fate of the liberty in the US against such a powerful force rested upon two POG Marines and their rifles, we knew we were pretty well screwed. Anyway, all that so far to say that it was cold, and we were bored.   I'd happened to get paired up with a guy from S-4 (logistics, including motor-T, who provided the Humvee). He always tried to get stationed there because his command was cool with him starting the Humvee, as long as he gassed it up the following day. So he had a sweet gig like I did in the tower. That was my second pick from then on for duty. Anyway, we'd been sitting inside the thing for hours, turning it off at any sight of headlights because the COG's only apparent purpose when it got cold was riding around making sure people weren't starting the Humvees.    I'd recently started smoking to stay awake on post. A habit that remained with me for my 8 years of service, but fortunately I was able to leave behind with my combat boots and camouflage (that I wore in white offices for 8 years for some inexplicable reason). Anyway, we were warm and sleepy in the middle of the night, and may or may not have been taking turns sleeping, but at one point I hadn't heard anything from him in a while, so I was messing around with the NVGs. Suddenly, the image begins to wash out on my right side. I look over and just see white. I yelled ""Holy S**!"" and I ripped off the NVGs and see that the last cigarette I dropped out of the window had set ablaze a bunch of pine needles around and under the Humvee. My partner has gone from 0 to high alert in about a second, and I heard him chamber a round (we had to carry with a full mag and empty chamber at that point) This was about two weeks after my last fire fiasco, so I'd already thought through the process of stripping down and using undergarments to put out the fire, so when I return from duty to surrender my weapon, I don't smell like smoke. I can only imagine my partner's thought process as he's suddenly immersed in this hysteric, cursing, stripping Marine lit by a rapidly growing ground fire. When I heard his bolt send that round home, my priority shifted from putting the fire out to assuring him the only threat was the fire. Together we got that knocked out and spent the next 3 hours wandering into the woods to bring back armfuls of pine needles to cover the scorch marks on the ground. All told, it wasn't my least productive time on duty.   In the following days, I got investigated by NCIS because the next guy to check out those NVGs got just an empty case. I told NCIS that it's unlikely they would have let me check in an empty case for such an expensive bit of gear, and they agreed.    TLDR: One time I dropped a cigarette out of a Humvee window. Hilarity ensued."

MilitaryStories,2mjb78,jb0356,3,Mon Nov 17 05:53:21 2014 UTC,I had to edit a large amount of this to put events in the correct order.
MilitaryStories,2mjb78,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Mon Nov 17 20:36:57 2014 UTC,"Not to worry, OP. Reddit has some pretty picky, unwritten edit rules that don't really apply to this subreddit. I edit like a boss sometimes - don't see any reason for all the little notices at the end of a story. We're not arguing philosophy here. We're trying to get these damned stories out of our heads and out into the world.  The stories don't come out all squeaky clean, nicely dressed and ready for cotillion. Sometimes they come out battle-grubby, especially when the author is trying to do what you're doing, OP - a temporally linear, stream-of-consciousness narration. Hard to do.  Considering the subject matter, that is understandable. You have a good story here. It's confusing, but then it's about battle and confusion, so slack for the narrator. You can clean it up later.  What you've captured is the kind of helmet-camera's eye view of combat - which in my experience is about the way the thing happens. Well done. Got me all worked up. I don't think I'm alone."
MilitaryStories,2mchxp,jb0356,5,Sat Nov 15 02:56:00 2014 UTC,"Um... you might want to re-think ""Spartan,"" OP. They were a little more than Philia. They were finally defeated by the Thebean ""Sacred Band,"" which upped the ante on the Spartan military model by fielding a phalanx of actual lovers, rather than man-boy pairings.   I dunno. I can't think of a better name for your story than ""Marines."" You write like a Marine, OP. All your buddies sound like Marines. It's a proud name. I don't know any modern military tradition that can match the US Marines since WWI. Don't think there are any other marines like them. Quite a tradition.   Seriously, the Spartans on their best day in their cups might wish they could be Marines."
MilitaryStories,2mchxp,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Sat Nov 15 03:19:20 2014 UTC,Abe's nickname was The Spartan.  It's on his gravemarker.  The title is a tribute to him.  I edited my early parts off reddit to include more info about him. He was the 12th in his family to wear the title Marine.    I think I called him John or something earlier as I wanted to keep some anonymousity.  It gets confusing when I use psudonames and switch them.

MilitaryStories,2mchxp,SoThereIwas-NoShit,5,Sat Nov 15 03:48:16 2014 UTC,"Love.  It's funny, because as much as I've thought about War, that's all I can come up with.  Right now it's our war, yours and mine.  Maybe not, I guess.  I'm out, and it sounds like you are, too.  I guess it's still 'Our War'.  There isn't a single day that goes by without Iraq or Afghanistan in my thoughts.  Less and less, thankfully, in my dreams.  I was lucky, like you weren't, and didn't lose anybody close.    Love.  That, I think, is what makes war possible.  The people that start wars and have nothing to lose may have their own reasons, but fighting men have love.  Sure, there are the times when kill is the word of the minute or hour or day, but it boils down to the love and the bond.  One of my Brothers, who I haven't talked to for too long, summed it up in a simple phrase once.  ""I'll be the first man through the door for you any day.""  A whole tome could, and probably has been, be written about the depth of that statement and its implications.   That's love.  That's why.  How else could it work?  Hate is short fuel, it works for a little while when the blood is up and running hot, but love for the men to the left and right is what keeps the line together, day after shitty day.  I don't know where I was going with this.  Good writing.  I don't like the story, but it's well told.  I'm sorry about Abe."

Not because of anything on your end, but because I didn't want to jump in that hole.  How can we describe it?  I burned the best woman I've ever known, after I got back from Afghanistan.  I was angry and mean and nothing, nobody, came close to the love I had for my squad mates.  Even guys I didn't personally like, I would do anything for them.  How deep does that go?  Rage.  Anger.  The wrath of god, and not giving a shit.  The weirdest high ever.  I remember one of our mechanics asking me if it was me yelling over the truck's internal comm.  it was our second complex ambush, that day, another truck blown up, and I was again firing out of the escape hatch of our RG.  It was night time, and we could actually see muzzle flash.  We actually had motherfuckers to shoot at.  Porkchop and I were sort of talking.  Him on the fifty and 240 from the turret, me with a SAW and M4.  We were supposed to be talking, but every time we got muzzle flash and watched those red tracers sliding towards us, we'd go cyclic.  I didn't even have my NOD's on.  I was just walking my tracers in, so was Porkchop.  Nobody was talking, other than relaying pertinent information, or the AG readying ammo for the both of us.   At some point, apparently, I just started yelling something like ""Die motherfucker!""  That was the only time I ever really lost it.  Porkchop did well.  He did better than well.  I didn't want him on the gun, because I didn't think he'd do okay, but I was wrong.  He stayed professional, and worked those fuckers good.  He stayed up and put rounds out and fucked shit up.  When we finally got to Sharana, and got into fixing our vics the next morning, his turret was all shot up, and he never once got down for anything but more ammunition."

MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,Dittybopper,3,Wed Nov 12 16:55:47 2014 UTC,"CBR training was scary shit, so many ways to die horribly. After a few instruction periods I figured a quick bullet to the brain would be the only real option.   Then there was that guy, the one who despite being warned not to put any pressure on the tip of the atropine injector just had to press it with his thumb. The needle went all the way through and squirted stuff all over as he screamed. A moment of levity in a grim reality show.  I posted a story of my introduction to CS gas some time back."
MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,lonegun,3,Wed Nov 12 17:48:49 2014 UTC,"Atropine is carried on almost every ambulance in the US and in every urgent care facility and hospital.  It is an anticholinergic used to block the neuro transmitter Acytlcholine.  Acytlcholine is the opposite neurotransmitter of epinephrine (adrenaline).  Acytlcholine is the neuro transmitter that triggers the ""feed and breed"" response in humans, reiterating that the the opposite of that is epinephrine which is the ""fight or flight"" response. We normally carry this drug to counteract symptomatic bradycardias (very slow heart rates) cause by an over abundance of...you guessed it, acytlcholine.  While we carry a significant dose of atropine on our ambulances, I have been informed that if there was a release of an agent such as VX, the supplies we carry are inadequate to sustain life for one person given the doses we carry.  The pnemonic SLUDGEM has been beaten into my brain to recognize an agent release (or more commonly an organophosphate poisoning, though I have never seen one of those).  Salivation (Drooling), Lacrimation (crying), Urination (Peeing), Defacation (Pooping), Gastrointestinal Distress, Emesis (vomiting), Muscle spasms. SLUDGEM.  Atropine may prolong your life in the advent of an agent release, but i wouldn't try and use it to get high.  Let's hope the day never comes where the stockpiles we keep of this drug are used."
MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,lonegun,3,Wed Nov 12 20:15:41 2014 UTC,"Very informative. I'm re-reading while running my fingertip across the screen and moving my lips.

I am flattered that you thought I might guess.    Salivation (Drooling), Lacrimation (crying), Urination (Peeing), Defacation (Pooping), Gastrointestinal Distress, Emesis (vomiting), Muscle spasms. SLUDGEM.   Yep. SLUDGEM. The goats did all of that. Broke some bones too. I'm guessing that weaponized sarin is more potent than the Aum Shinrikyo home brew.   Thank you.

My daughter has been trained that we don't squish bugs, because the bugs have lives too. I understand why we test drugs, and nerve agents on animals, but it must be shocking to view goats being subjected to that knowing that we would subject our fellow humans to the same thing.    Realistically though.  Humans are animals as well, and killing each other in the most effective manner is a part of human nature.  I fervently hope you and I never have to experience these agents used against another person ever."
MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,Dittybopper,2,Wed Nov 12 22:23:58 2014 UTC,"because the bugs have lives too.   I think all nerve agents are derived from German insecticides. Funny you should mention bugs.   it must be shocking to view goats being subjected to that knowing that we would subject our fellow humans to the same thing.    It was shocking. I'm a city boy. I get my meat from the grocery. Never slaughtered an animal. Seemed gross and cruel.  Not so shocking to see human victims. I saw films of mustard gas burns and Nagasaki casualties, including women and babies. The goats really bothered me. I'm pretty sure my ""bother"" meter is broken. I'm not alone.  Did see some human subjects subjected to LSD-like BZ. Some 1950ish soldiers in those pillbox hats and fatigues fixing a stalled truck in the woods. Then they started staring at things, and kind of just sat down. Didn't look like fun."
MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,SoThereIwas-NoShit,3,Wed Nov 12 22:43:14 2014 UTC,"Its kind of funny.  But not funny at all.  A ""bother meter"" is an interesting concept.  I describe my ""bother meter"" as my soul.  Not the whole soul or even a soul as a religious aspect of my being.  My ""bother meter"" is a significant part of me as a peraon, but it exists almost as a finite part of my being.  When I started as an EMT, it was whole.  As a piece of finite material, I slowly (quickly?) Ground it to dust.  I remark to colleagues that a part of me has been forever altered, possibly lost.  I have never taken a life, but I have seen the glassy stare of a dead person countless times.  Its just that. Glass.  It feels that, that trauma amongst others has whittled me (us?) Down as people.  We go our whole lives watching other peoples eyes, a genuine smile is reflected in the eyes.  Sadness, anger, lust, all reflected in the eyes.  But when someone has no reflection, no life, their eyes become glassy.  Glass, a window, a window looking out, or in to nothing.  You look into glassy eyes, and there is nothing left there.  There is no ""soul"", no emotion, its...death.  Death is something that most people will never see or experience first hand.  You in your way, and me in mine, as well as numerous others, experience death and pain in all shapes and sizes.  It does change us, it takes that base human instinct to care, and over time forces it into a shape that we can mold ourselves around. It is not always a shape we are comfortable with.  It suppose that my soul, or "" bother meter"" has not been completely lost, as I expect yours exisits in much the same state.  There are things that still bother us, there are things that anger us, incite happiness, and maybe even lust from time to time?.  Maybe our bother meters haven't been broken.  Maybe they have matured, or just over time been honed and shaped to deal with the lives we have lived.  Over time, we have seen so much human suffering, we have become immune to it, except in certain circumstances.  Being city boys, we don't see the suffering of animals on a regular basis (not that slaughtering animals is cruel, but I'm sure you get the gist).  When we do see animals in pain, it illicits a reaction.  A reaction  that we have not built mental defences against.   Hopefully i'm not reading into your response too much, or trying to analyze you, but my opinion of you (frankly its my own reflection of myself more than you) is that you (me?) Are better defended against trauma vs. Humans, than vs animals.  It doesn't mean your bother meter is broken, you just handle mental trauma better.    P.S. I cried after my ferret died.  Fat, stupid ferret that fell asleep in his food dish regularly.  His name was Dozer, broken teeth, dragged his big belly around after him...loved him to death.  Don't know why your goats got me all riled up."

She was a great dog.  I'm with /u/Dittybopper. You seem to have a good handle on this. There is some difference between dealing and feeling. I think you deal with all this common death. What you feel is stored away, but not lost. You're not numb, you're busy. It's there. It makes you a more valuable human. Adult.  We need more adults. Always a pleasure to meet one."
MilitaryStories,2m1dcp,All_Secure,2,Thu Nov 13 03:13:05 2014 UTC,"We also, at least in '03, carried diazepam.  The atropine and diazepam were in auto-injectors, and you were supposed to do up to a series of three doses.  We were actually worried about getting slimed in Iraq.  Supposedly the atropine/diazepam(valium) would keep us alive for the rest of the day, enough to sort of finish the fight, and then you'd die.  That sounds like bullshit, but maybe not."

Although that's probably better than extreme bushfire conditions, and the army guys being careless while doing dems training and starting a major bushfire that took out a fair few houses.  The Australian Navy once based its recruiting campaign around the idea that ""you'll be cold, frightened and homesick, but you'll be the pride of the fleet!"" Not sure how that worked, but it did.

MilitaryStories,2lxygr,Bandors,17,Tue Nov 11 06:30:25 2014 UTC,"Is this the thread where we story-bomb our cook stories? Here‚Äôs mine!  This happened in 1968, I Corps, Vietnam. We had just bailed from a loooong operation in the middle of a NVA basecamp in triple canopy jungle. It was a South Vietnamese Army operation, so supply was limited to kick-outs, at best - food and ammo. All of our clothes had rotted.  We had scrounged through the NVA basecamp for replacement clothes. I was in boots two sizes too large, gray pants with silver piping down the leg and my jungle fatigue shirt. My tall, blond Recon Sergeant was in NVA khaki shorts, US jungle boots and a tight blue sweatshirt that barely reached his waste. My RTO‚Äôs fatigues were torn and rotted. We had regulation helmets and web gear, but otherwise we were out of uniform. I kinda looked like this, thin and hungry, but even younger since this picture was taken more than a year later. I was a 2nd Lieutenant, all of 20 years old.  We were traveling by jeep along Highway 1 north of Hu√© from  MACV at PK 17 back to our battalion in Quang Tri. We were hungry, and all out of c-rats. There! On the left. It was Camp Evans! I‚Äôd worked with a battery there. Gotta have a mess hall. We turned in through the gate, and by God, there was one.  It was mid-morning. We were greeted at the door by the Mess Sergeant, a large, tall (maybe 6' 5"") Black man, who clearly enjoyed his own food. He eyed us quizzically. I have to admit we looked pretty sketchy.  He was not impressed by the cloth gold bar on my collar. Plus, it was between meals, he didn't know us from an ox and I was barely 20 and looked maybe 16. I think he thought we were faking something, maybe some scam.  I didn't care. I was tired. He brought us coffee, and we were so grateful and happy to see real coffee, I think he decided we were legit. He watched me for a minute slurping down sugar flavored with coffee and milk. He'd been frowning the whole time.   Finally, he piped up, ""Uh Sir? Can I ask you a question?"" I already knew the question. ""I'm twenty,"" I said.  Here's the part that is etched in my memory. His whole head cracked open in a giant grin, huge pearly white teeth from ear to ear. Was a startling transformation. He seemed delighted. Booming voice: ""SHEEEEEEEE-IT! I GOT BABIES OLDER'N YOU!"" I was hilarious. I think he adopted me right there.  He spent the next hour trying to feed me all the food he had. I think he was trying to make me grow older and taller on the spot. If I had more time, he might have succeeded. We had a pretty good meal.  Props to Mess Sergeants everywhere this Veterans Day. Highest honors. Chow and mail, in that order. Everything else is incidental in comparison. Plus, it's nice to know I got a second Daddy out there somewhere. Can‚Äôt have too many Dads!"

This story is true to my memory of it. The problem is, my memory may be mistaken.  After I finished ‚ÄúDark I discovered that I had put in so much detail that I doxxed the Gunny. I was so shocked at how quickly people winkled out his identity, I went back to the database for the Vietnam Wall Memorial for the first time in decades. I was staggered at how much information had been added since I was there, including several pictures of the Gunny which threw me for a loop. So I looked up other people.  I was told Sergeant Clark was dead. I did not see the medivac. I was told the same thing when I got back to my battery somewhat later. I had assumed he died before he got put on the helicopter. The Army disagrees. The Wall data says he died sometime later, a surprising amount of time considering. I can only conclude two things:  1) The Wall data is in error. Not likely, but possible. 2) He was still alive when he got on the medivac. Here‚Äôs my thinking:  Okay, he was medivac‚Äôed out by a US Medivac. The ARVN wounded went back to the hospital in Hu√© in one of the Blackcat logslicks assigned to support us. Medivacs notoriously refused to transport dead people. American soldiers notoriously were furious about that, and would routinely lie to the Medivac people about the condition of their soldiers. Medivacs were also notorious for refusing bodies on the LZ, which led to many angry, unfunny ‚ÄúDead Parrot‚Äù dialogues shouted over helicopter rotor noise. So there‚Äôs that.  I‚Äôm guessing probably alive. I had no idea until four months ago. I decided to write this story the way I remembered it, rather than with all this quibbling.  So, those may not have been Clark‚Äôs last words. Sorry.  And to the guys who doxxed the Gunny: Okay. I‚Äôm pretty sure he wouldn‚Äôt have minded. So no harm no foul. I know you can‚Äôt help yourself, and you all kept what you found to yourself, so thanks for that.  I‚Äôm telling you, Clark would NOT want to be doxxed. I knew the guy, and I know this. Not gonna tell you why. Sorry. I will tell you that I‚Äôve fudged some details about him - I owe him that. I‚Äôm just saying that if he gets doxxed and his angry ghost appears to me, I‚Äôm gonna give him your names. Please don‚Äôt. He was a friend of mine."

I'm having a glass of Laphroaig for you and Clark and Newingham and your Gunnery Sergeant and that kid, even the fucking Water Buffalo.  I'm so glad I don't have a story like yours.  Fuck it."

BUT I COULD NOT READ IT! What the hell? I got frustrated.   I don't know why, but that was a gut-punch.    I do know why.   As I got to towards the exhausted end of your As Samawah eleven-part saga, your increasingly disoriented reaction to heat and confusion and exhaustion and dirt and dust - expertly and effectively rendered - reminded me (forcefully) of the 3rd of July. You remained functional. So did I. It wasn't until I read that letter that I felt just how fucked up I was, more than I had ever been. Something broke, something bent, and things were never going to be the same. I was never going to be the same. The letter was just a wake-up call.   I was again reminded of that time by your brutal and compelling story Brown Eyes Cryin' in the Sun - something that could never be undone, got done. No going back. No redemption. No salvation. Done. The connection between then and now just got severed. Start a new past right now. That new past began for me on the 3rd of July.  What I'm trying to say here is ""You started it."" It's a brutal subreddit. This week I'm Arjuna. Last week you were. Next week it's Dittybopper's turn. Then someone else, please. Having your hair set on fire isn't as much fun as you'd think. They don't tell you these things when they sign you up.  I have to admit, the OP is tough to take all at once. I had it set to be three parts, but the mods upped the character limit to 40K, so it all fit on one page. Might have gone down smoother in three parts. Something to consider next time. Was kind of a shock for me too. The mods made me do it - because they let me, and it was easier. Their fault.  So Laphroaig all around. You can drink mine. Some for my ghosts, some for yours. Some for Dittybopper, but not his ghosts because they're being dickish. I'll have mine in a canteen cup.  Thanks for reading. Thanks for the kind words. Another one out of my head and into the world.

It is a wonderfully told story, I seriously doubt there exists a better report on the whole internet. Like Grinder I too can't quite bring myself to re read it, too soon and too close. I've promised myself to do it though, read it again.  It seems all of us had that crash point where it all caved in on us. Our faith in 'normal' erased forever. Mine occurred at the Fishnet factory in early November with a little help from General Davis, but it began with that blond kid on FSB Stephanie back in May.

MilitaryStories,2ljrre,snimrass,3,Sun Nov 9 05:05:17 2014 UTC,"Thank you, but I think everybody is stirring away.  I was thinking last night about why I was (now) unsure when Clark died. They were yelling at me while I was trying to help him. The Thi√™u t√°, the Battalion Commander, was moving out to the point of contact. He was the one who dispatched his medics and two MACV guys to tend to Clark. A couple of ARVN officers were getting me up, grabbing our artillery radio ruck, getting me ready to move.  So there it is. I'm two for two. One of my people died while I was away, and the other I had to leave in the field. As /u/Dittybopper said, some of your KIAs teach you not to get close to anybody.  And here's the point: Just before I was motivated to (finally!) put this story in better shape, re-write it, I read /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit's Zerok posts, Part 6 and Part 7, where he talks about caring for his wounded guys, holding their hands, keeping them awake until the medivac can get there.  It was an intense post, no doubt hard for him to write, hard to read. But while I was reading, I realized I was jealous of all that hand-holding, that I had been jealous of someone being able to tend to wounded friends even when I was there watching it. Sounded nice. Which is insane. So a little of what's in this post was written by /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit. More than a little, actually.  We're all stirrin' our little brains out. No one person is writing here. We all are. You too."

You have lived all these years thinking of him as dead yet there is some information that it is not so.   Oh, he's dead. Name's on the wall. I didn't make myself clear. He didn't die when I thought he did (or the Pentagon got it wrong maybe), but yep, dead.    continue out into the woods and when you find the right place lay your burden down, literally. Look up, you are in a cathedral, the only one that really counts.   I like that. I may just do it. I know just the place too. Great Sand Dunes, the wildest, weirdest place in Colorado.  But y'know, I think you and I are handling this differently. I want my dead around. I want to remember them - all of them. Seems rude not to - to me anyway. I feel an obligation - I was supposed to protect some of them, and I truncated the lives of the others. I just want a little peace with all of it.  I think I went to an Ashram or maybe a Pagoda, rather than a cathedral. I'm a slow study. What was that third story anyway? Some kid in a rice paddy, can't control his water buffalo, may have to shoot the buffalo... oh wait, he got him going the other way... nice work kid. We would've fucked up that huge sack of bullshit, haw haw haw... Nothing. Just another 15 minutes in Vietnam.  If I hadn't had my head cracked open and the blinders removed from my eyes, I would've seen it that way. If Clark had been there beside me, I would've have seen it that way. It feels like a gift - for which I am not grateful, the price was too high. But over time it grew more important to me. Didn't change things, didn't make them better, just made me more at peace with that day.   I carry a piece of a meteorite that hit Kamchatka about the time I was conceived. It was given to me by a woman who cares about me. I carry it, because I like carrying it. I feel better with it than without it. Charlie and the Kid are like that. I'd rather carry them with me. I feel better. That's all.  Hope that makes sense.   Edit: Yeah, Clark being deeper in that hole than me has registered in my frontal lobe more'n a few times. What the hell? The thing still sits in the middle of my memory - doesn't fit into any niche or file. Gonna have to find another pagoda to get that off the file-room floor. Good eye, DB."

MilitaryStories,2ljrre,tomyrisweeps,6,Sat Nov 8 03:10:40 2014 UTC,"Wow!  Where to even start.  First, thank you.  I'll ramble from here on.  Dad's friend and fellow sgt. died in his arms.  I've posted about it here a few times.  When I have a dark moment, I make myself remember all the people who have made it possible for me to be here.  Joe always stands out because, in a roundabout way, he saved dad's life.  Guess some moments are more poignant than others.  I've never had the guts to ask if there were any last words.  Dad always tears up when he talks about it, and I don't want to hurt him by asking something that deep.  He still has the map, stained with red dirt and marked to indicate where the ambush happened.  Stinking hot.  Dad got the better end of that deal.  He had something of a sixth sense.  Sometimes things ""just didn't feel right,"" and, when he had that feeling, they usually weren't.  He could also smell that fishy smell a mile away.  I remember a platoon reunion several years ago.  A good ol' boy from Kentucky wrapped his arm around my shoulders and pointed across the room to dad.  ""He was spooky.  He could smell them Gooks."" (Note: if ""Gook"" offends you in the context of a story, go fuck yourself.  If you want to be offended further, let me know and I'll do my best.  This PSA brought to you by me and not directed in any way at OP.)  Dad also mentioned shivering and feeling like he was going to freeze to death when the temp hovered around 80.  There were fuckups in dad's platoon.  There were also some damned fine soldiers I've had the honor of meeting.  The fuckups were generally singled out quickly and had the odd habit of doing their damnedest to get sent to another unit.  Dad caught an FNG smoking dope and listening to the radio on headphones while on guard duty.  The guy disappeared into the bowels of the Army like a fart in a tornado.  Most of the experienced guys took FNG's under their wing and taught them how to survive.  The sooner the new guy is brought up to speed, the sooner he can cover your ass reliably.  The thing that always seemed really twisted to me, is that the enlisted had to figure out how to do the same thing with officers.    A couple of months into his tour, a new company commander rotated in.  The guys were a bit uncertain about the last captain.  They were uncertain about the new one, too.  He hadn't been in country long and had no combat experience.  To his credit, he was willing to be trained by his NCO's and enlisted men.  He was a hell of a guy.  Cancer got him a couple years ago.  He made it though combat in Vietnam.  Cancer got him.  The VC and NVA did their best to kill him and failed...but cancer.  /rabbittrail  Funny how different jobs made the experience completely different.  Grandpa was a major with the 82nd (355th?).  He'd go to make sure stuff got done.  When business was taken care of, he was flown back to a warm, dry base with hot food and a bunk.  Granted that changed when he joined a unit that didn't exist and wasn't in Colombia for a couple of years and (if he was there) he never carried a weapon issued to him by El Presidente.  I digress.  Sounds like you spent time on firebases with forays into the jungle.  Dad spent most of his time in the boonies starving when they Army forgot about them, getting munched on by all manner of insect and leech, nearly getting munched on by a tiger, sick from drinking the water, etc.  Oh, there was the shootie stuff, too.  Complete topic change.  I wish you and dad could co-author a book.  His blunt, straight forward story telling and your ingenious flair for poetry would make a killer novel.  To be completely unfair, if I don't hear about a book soon, I'm going to sic your kid on you again.  She can be far more persuasive than I can.  You may or many not grok the reference, but we ganged up on you a while back.  /rambling  Again, thank you."

It can either ground you (rare) or make you puff up and get full of yourself (common).  Colonel Jack was minding his own business when one of his NCOs suddenly volunteered to brief him on issues in his own unit - the kind of briefing that can't be had for love nor money. You can't make this kind of honesty happen. It requires anonymous eagles, a casino, and liquor.   Colonel Jack is, I expect, thinking he ought to alert his NCO that he's in the presence of his commanding officer, but y'know, the guy has already pissed him off. Let him rant. Let's hear what he has to say. He's kind of volunteered for this.  So Colonel Jack gets himself an NCO-level eye and earful about his unit. Maybe some of it is good stuff. Probably most of it is the same complaint senior NCOs always have moving to a new unit - We followed this arbitrary procedure in my old unit, and this fucked up unit follows some other arbitrary procedure that is different. This is bad, because I don't have to think about my old unit's arbitrary way of doing things, and I'm gonna have to learn a whole new one, which I'm pretty sure is not as good as the one we had, but even if it is, it's not the one I'm used to. If it's that, then Colonel Jack can end the briefing.  But maybe, just maybe, this guy is on to something. Maybe he's got a better way, that a noob NCO will never get past the other, more senior NCOs. Stop him. Sober him up. Call him in for a formal briefing and get what information you can out of him. If he makes sense, encourage him. Take notes. Make sure your NCO know he fucked up (he knows anyway), but if the information is good, that mitigates consequences. If it's really good, there should be no consequences at all, no matter how many times he remarked on what a brass-hat the Old Man was.  Because senior officers can't get this kind of information. Their information is censored and shaped by echelons of NCOs who can't help having a vested interest in doing things the same way they've always been done. You gotta take your opportunities to get on the other side of those echelons when they present themselves. Put your ego and your eagles aside for a minute and listen hard.  That's a good officer and a good commander. A rare bird. Props to Colonel Jack."

We couldn't believe he might have some lady waiting for him back in the states, but when he was in his cups, he did go on and on about some gal named ""Four-deuce.""   Good story OP. Isn't there some prohibition against planting mines - the Geneva Conventions, or something? Just wondering if you got in trouble. I myself have skirted the edges of those conventions by trying to wrap a sniper up in a smokescreen of white phosphorus. I really wanted to (nicely) prevent him from seeing us.

MilitaryStories,2kr7sl,AnathemaMaranatha,4,Mon Nov 3 14:14:38 2014 UTC,"Not sure. We were told that in Vietnam, laying mines was severely restricted. In addition all existing or new minefields had to be mapped and reported back to high HQ.  Might have been a local agreement with the Republic of Vietnam. The only people allowed to have minefields were US Special Forces camps - we never had access to mines. The firebases relied on concertina and tanglefoot, trip wire, flares and claymores.  I had the honor of navigating the minefield around the abandoned US SF base at A Shau. Was terrifying. Bouncing Betty is a lousy date.  So I was just wondering where OP's people even got an anti-tank mine? Seems strange to imagine the things just lying around among the spare ammo, without any command control over their use, to the point where one could be midnight requisitioned."

The army never lets you have the good toys, do they?   They were in IDF uniforms and sporting machine guns. No hats, nice hair, uniform shirts pleasantly, but not indecently, open down the front, sleeves rolled up, and wearing what for the time were very tight, short skirts. I was in love.    Sounds like how Grinder was imagining the lady on the radio in his latest story. Or maybe not. His might have had a shorter skirt.  I feel like making fun of you boys for getting far too distracted far too easily, but there's just no fun in it. Truth is funnier than exaggeration in this case. Have fun with your business-like blondes, lads. Let me know when it's safe to come by again.   I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve reached that kind of comfort with our military even today when soldiers are more revered than despised. There is still a separation, the presence of soldiers is an unnatural thing. Makes people uncomfortable.   This though ... I don't disagree. More than happy to be corrected, as I'm once again trying to figure out US culture from the outside, but doesn't that excessive reverence come from the same place as the revulsion? You are the other. You don't fit in quite right. You've done shit they can't get their head around, and don't even want to try to figure out. The reverence still puts the military apart from the civvies, sets you at a distance.  That could be completely wrong, and maybe I'm going to accidentally start an argument with some other excessively patriotic idiot. I think I could have worded it better, but I think you will have got my intent. If not, I'll rework it in the morning.  Still, it's not as bad here. It's just another job.

About five minutes and I'm done.  Gets my hackles up.  As far as the ""Million Dollar Wound"", he was back on duty in the week.  He went on mid-tour leave shortly after, and his family thought he was all sorts of fucked-up in the head.  They, most likely his Mom, started calling their Representatives, which led to Battalion leadership getting phone calls, which led to him getting transfered to Bagram Airfield at a Staff desk job, which he absolutely fucking hated.  After getting fucking shot, he wanted to be out in the field getting shot at more.  Everybody but him knew what was good for him.  Fucking politics.

I could feel my battle buddy wanting to panic break/steer.  Somehow EM came out and communicated with buddies EM.  Words to the effect of ""Dont Brake"" in full command voice were said.  Reaction by my buddy was proper and we smoothly drove out of the slide.  EM number the two: New born baby on my hip, walking down carpeted stairs (steep).  Heel slips off and down we're going.  Time stops and I'm somehow able to assess my rate of decent, the angle of the stairs and my grip on the child.  EM takes over, wraps kid in my center mass with back hunched for shock absorption.  We (I) hit hard enough to crack a stair with my elbow.  Slide down the stairs with kid on my chest.  We hit the main floor and EM instantly does a full check on the kid.

MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,snimrass,7,Wed Oct 29 16:01:03 2014 UTC,"I have spoken on my ""watcher"" (my term for EM) a few times in this forum. I caught him at it one time as he was minutely scanning the ground just ahead as I walked across some flat ground on a fire base. There was an unexpected noise, a pop or something, I forget. But Watcher had me on the ground and flattened in this tiny fold in the earth before I was conscious of moving. In the second or so I remained down it flashed to me that my ""back brain"" knew before I did where to hit the dirt. Watcher knew just the place to duck or dive too when the shit hit the fan, which way to roll out of the line of fire and was even wide awake watching as I slept. Any odd, out of place noise and watcher had me up and fully functioning with my weapon at the ready in a seeming heartbeat. Its like that sixth sense that tells you someone is staring at you.  Once when skydiving, just a buddy and I in freefall practicing some hooking up maneuvers, we lost track of time and were going too low. I was unaware how low we were but Watcher knew and yelled loud and clear ""LOOK!"" I did, looked down and a bolt of lightning shot through me as I see below me a small farm pond like I'd never seen it before (or since); coming up fast and rapidly filling my vision. I involunteeraly screemed ""Shitttttttttttt"" as I deployed my chute my eyes glued to that ever widening pond. All I could see was water before the chute jerked me upright and ""breathed"" just once and I was on the ground tumbling beside the pond. Watcher saved me again again that day. people on the ground said they distinctly heard my scream as I deployed that parachute. Oh, my buddy deployed a moment before me so his chute took two breaths before he landed.  Thanks for the story Master AM."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,Dittybopper,3,Sat Oct 25 00:37:09 2014 UTC,"Kind of reminds of what I've been calling ""primal monkey brain"". That thing that when you're daydreaming on your ride home points out that the car one lane over wants to come share your personal space, and has the bike moving before conscious brain had even registered that the car exists.  Primal monkey brain just wants to stay alive. Doesn't care for the rest of the bullshit. Dunno if that's the same as Emergency Me though. I think monkey brain is one level down - it only cares about me getting out alive. EM thinks a little more. Doesn't go straight for fight or flight.

MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,Dittybopper,7,Sat Oct 25 02:23:37 2014 UTC,"My most memorable (and potentially most spectacular) is a bit more light-hearted.  Skiing down a mountain at dusk, the snow is all the same color and you lose a lot of your depth perception. One of the characteristics of a black diamond (hard) slope is that there are drops. At high speed, sudden drops become sudden jumps. 50 or 60 MPH is high enough speed to do it.  One moment I was carving out turns, the next moment I had crossed over what was a mountainside road with a drop-off on the far side during the summer. During the winter, it was just a tiny level patch followed by 30 feet of cliff. I was not prepared to be suddenly 30 feet in the air, doing something over 50 MPH, with a treeline full of mature hardwood coming up about 200 feet ahead of me.  There's a reason lots of skiers wear helmets these days. Hitting trees at that speed will kill you. Just ask Sonny Bono. Helmets won't fix a shattered ribcage, but they'll make sure you don't crush your skull too. Back then, nobody wore helmets.  It takes a hair shy of 1.5 seconds to fall 30 feet. That's enough time to travel over halfway to that treeline in the air. It was also enough time to realize what those trees would do to me if I hit them, go from fully extended and tilted about 30 degrees to the right mid-turn, to a slight crouch, knees bent and directly over my skis.  Somewhere in there, I swear there was an internal dialogue about poor life choices.  WHOMP. Ground. Lovely stuff, ground. It gives you all sorts of options. Eighty feet. 75. 70. Weight goes right, now. Skis follow, carving down into the snow. As soon as they catch, my trajectory starts shifting and I'm aimed for the clear again. Good thing, because that's when my bindings decided I was obviously crashing and they'd better detach before they broke my ankles/knees. Turns out ground is cold and hard too, but as I spent the next hundred feet skidding to a stop, it was probably a lot softer than trees.  I'd never done anything over a five foot hop to that point. After it was daylight again and my binding breakaways were re-tuned to professional levels, I went back to try that slope at speed again, because that's what stupid teenagers do.  Wasn't the first time everything unnecessary turned off and things went into slow motion. Not the last time either. When you get jumped three or four to one, or when that guy has a knife, when you realize that bullet was right there, or your ears are ringing from the mortar explosion, the adrenaline fires and you're more alive than you've ever been, even when one mistake could mean you won't be in a few seconds.  It can get addictive."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,SoThereIwas-NoShit,2,Sat Oct 25 02:19:19 2014 UTC,"Yes to everything you said. I spent some time as the only non-skier in Telluride. Double Black Diamond ohshitohshitohshit stories were everywhere. Did I mention that I don't ski? I was older than 30 when I was in Telluride. Never occurred to me to put boards on my feet.  That bullet noise drove me right out of the theater showing Saving Private Ryan, but never roused Emergency Me. By the time you hear it, it's over. Mortars though... someone yells s√∫ng c√¥i! [shoom-coi!] and you hear the explosions walking your way... Everything goes to slo-mo.   So you went back the next day? That's the kind of behavior I think the Phlegmatic Lobe evolved to deal with. Something has to nursemaid you through that period from freedom at 18 until your brain finishes growing at about 26. The casualty rate would be much higher without something like Emergency Me."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,Dittybopper,3,Sat Oct 25 03:14:32 2014 UTC,"You really got me thinking about this since you posted.  Where was that part of myself.  Did we get so used to it that it became normal?  I'm thinking every jump, after the first couple, that was the guy in charge.  Those were emergencies, i guess.  The best they got were okay, the worst they got weren't too bad, personally, but they could get nasty really quick.  Every single time was hoping something wouldn't go wrong and everything would work out and it would be the normal slamming into the ground.  Live fire exercises were the same ticket.  Do it, and do it right.  Hopefully the Grunts don't accidentally shoot you, but if they do...well, you'll get shot.  There were a few times in South-West Asia where I'm sure my lizard-brain kicked in before my ""smart"" brain did, but I don't remember it that way.  It was business at the time.  I guess there was the one where I launched myself, in full gear, out of a cargo humvee that was in the process of rolling over.  I waited for it to hit that balance point, where I knew it was rolling, and just kicked myself as far out and away from it as I could.  No injury that I got would be as bad as having a truck on top of me.  And aside from some bruises, I came out pretty well.  Less than I would have on any given airborne operation at Bragg.  The other was on the way to Ghazni.  Pressure plate, three trucks in front of me on a one lane road, and somehow my mine-roller set it off.  The cab went black with the insta-dust of getting blown up.  My head went into damage control mode.  The most recent was at Joshua Tree National Park.  We were climbing some rocks.  My girlfriend at the time was following my good friend up a spot that she shouldn't have been going.  He's a rock climber.  I grew up bouldering and generally doing controlled stupid-climbing.  She grew up in the city.  We were on an enormous red granite rock formation.  There were ways up, but most of the formation  sloped down to 90 degrees.  I was looking for a way up that I felt comfortable with.  She was following Bobby.  I came back around the formation to see her following Bobby up a chimney sort of thing.  I'd been 270 degrees around the thing, and I wasn't going any higher.  Didn't feel right.  She was following him up a nasty spot.  A technical spot.  I didn't like it, but I didn't want to say anything.  going up is easy, and you don't want to shake somebody's confidence when they're in a tight place.  She slipped, slid down the chimney, and started sliding down the granite.  She did everything right, she pancaked, but I lost sight of her as she went behind some rocks.  This was steep stuff, and in my mind I was just going to be looking for her at the bottom, on the ground.  I moved as fast as I could, which wasn't very fast.  My brain was shut down.  It was damage control at that point.  Emotions didn't exist.  I was hoping I wasn't looking for a body, but I was ready for it.   She stopped, skin on granite makes good brakes, just shy of a thirty or forty foot drop onto boulders."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,SoThereIwas-NoShit,2,Tue Oct 28 04:12:45 2014 UTC,"I only jumped (was pushed) out of a plane twice. Both times I was more of a passenger, first of the plane, then of the chute, then of the ground. I couldn't see any place where action by me was required, except maybe preventive action to make sure no one made me do that ever again. Don't think Emegency Me would show up for that S3-involved homicide. Too much premeditation.  But still, I was wondering too. Is it possible to make your Emergency Mind show up? Seems like EMTs and Emergency Room people can do that. Seems like they're in a zone.  I'm guessing jumping out of a plane - if you've been trained to know the places where individual actions can affect the process - might require a regular, even normal interface with your Emergency Mind.  I'm not sure I can conjure mine. It seems to show up when needed, at it's own volition."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,snimrass,3,Tue Oct 28 15:44:11 2014 UTC,"Jumping out of a plane. I've done that, a lot! Civilian jumping, not like Grinder doing military style parachuting, and you. That's a whole different animal. Skydiving is for fun, long freefall's down to the point (each time) where you must go ahead and save your life by deploying the chute. Watcher and EM are there, they are always there, even on the drive home afterwards. They are not intruding however, just lurking in the background as usual. I believe they can act in subtle ways at times though.  Say you're on the way to the dropzone some sunny saturday morning, perfect jump weather, everything seems good and you're anticipating a fine day of jumping, you could get in six to eight jumps that day if all goes well. You'll be drop dead tired at the end of it but your endorphins will be bubbling like mad and they will last the whole of next week, gradually tapering until you're jonesing for your next fix.  But once at the DZ, which seems perfectly normal, something mutes your mood, it is hard to pinpoint what is causing it but something just doesn't feel right. If you're smart you will recognize the feeling, pause and let your mind tell you what's bothering you. Its Watcher, he's telling you without telling you not to jump today, that today isn't a good day afterall, to obey your gut. I learned to listen to that feeling. Did I miss something awful by letting the day go by without parachuting? I don't know, I just know what I was told."

Honestly, I always thought it would be pretty fun.  It was on my list of things to do in life, before I did the Angry version.  You could probably get me to do it now, my pride would get me out the door, if I didn't have to do a tandem.  Fuck that noise.  Wouldn't want somebody on my back making important decisions for me."

MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,autowikibot,2,Wed Oct 29 09:43:58 2014 UTC,"I think you really should give it a try. It is very different from military jumping except you still have to know your shit for emergencies. Squares very rarely malfunction, in fact they have no known malfunction mode unlike rounds. Shit can happen of course so you have to react. Typically that means cutting way and going to your reserve, another square. You don't cut anything you pull a small ripcord which releases the main so you are back in freefall briefly before deploying the reserve. Still got to know a PLF too, sometimes you have to resort to one. And oh, squares have a much larger ""cone of possibility, meaning from the point of opening you can reach anywhere in a 72 degree cone downwind as opposed to a round chute which only has an 18 degree possible range.  Freefall is where its at, you have to learn to do that also, not hard. The thing about tandem jumps is getting to experience freefall. But yes, some stranger is in control, which sucks. The thing to do would be to phone around and ask if any parachute centers still do static line jumps. I simply do not know, it is likely though and i know they did a couple of years ago.   So, you go to a DZ and train for a day then do a static line. You ride a square down. You don't have a fuck ton of gear on, you aren't going to play war immediately after the jump. All good. Doing static jumps was how I learned, the requirement was a minimum of five SL jumps before you made your first unassisted jump. It was a ""hop'n pop,"" you exited and pulled the ripcord immediately after. Things progressed with longer and longer delays before deploying until you were off training status, after working up to 9000 AGL jumps. You were then free to skydive at will.  And hell yeah, I'd do another jump in a heartbeat."
MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,SoThereIwas-NoShit,1 point,Wed Oct 29 03:03:02 2014 UTC,"Maybe I should go over to /r/AskScience. I can't believe nobody is studying this.  DB, I see you have folded Emergency You in with what I'd call another sensor personality. Emergency Me is overwhelmingly present when he's around. He only shows up in a perceived emergency. He also tends to take charge peremptorily.  But I recognize what you're talking about. I think there's a brain part that processes all the sensory input you're getting, not just the stuff that filters up to your consciousness. Consciousness gets only a JPG version of the sensory input, and as you know, in order for a camera to manufacture a JPG it discards information in the RAW file, which contains all the data that was detected by the camera's sensors.  The sensory guy works the same way. He's a RAW file editor. He doesn't take over or speak to me. What he does is filter data, and if he sees a pattern, my consciousness may not smell or hear or taste or feel anything, but it notes that the hair on my neck is standing up, I'm uneasy, worried, hyper-alert all of a sudden. Your body is processing a lot more sensory data than your consciousness perceives - electrical fields, high and low sounds, ESP, who knows?  Not exactly the same thing as EM, but I've learned to listen. Don't always react, but I pay attention. Point man got a bad feeling? Yeah, I want to know about it.  This is not a matter of belief. I really don't know what is happening. It's a matter of practicality and subjective experience. Sometimes it seems like you know more than you should know, more than you think you can know. You want to bet your life that it's nothing, just your imagination? No? Then pay attention."

The first time I was 16, a buddy and I had left work 10 minutes prior and we were headed for the mountains from Atlanta, going camping. We didn't make it, a car cut me off and I swerved sharply to avoid it. The VW's right front strut decided to fail just then and turned under the car which flipped us end over end five times. Time slowed to a crawl as the car cartwheeled and I counted each impact until it ended up on its roof sliding down the pavement with a beautiful display of sparks showering away until the rear of the roof impacted the curb and the car slid up onto a bridge railing and balanced there for a moment then slid backward and back into the road. Then I smelled gasoline.   We lived. I've never forgotten a detail of that wreck and why not, I witnessed it in slow motion, frame by frame.  ADD: I will look that book up, Blink."

I'm not sure I didn't - see ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" by Amrose Bierce - I just don't want to know.  Anyway, can confirm - time slowed down. Or perception speeded up.

MilitaryStories,2k7l6r,snimrass,2,Thu Oct 30 18:09:32 2014 UTC,"I used to get the slow down effect a lot when I was little. For reasons unknown I would always jump down the stairs, usually from 4-5 or so steps up. The time slow came when I would, as far as I was aware, was jumping from the very top of the stairs. Things slowed down and I landed at the bottom without harm.  Thinking about it now, it makes me wonder (if the memories are correct) if I was triggering some kind of 'You're about to die!' trigger.  The only other time I can remember it happening was again as a child, there was a playground with a slide that had to have been at least 3 yards up from the ground. You could get up there by either climbing a series of short ladders/steps from the attached playground area, or scale the outside of the ladder tower with metal rungs.  I was there with my mother (RIP), maybe 6 or 7 years old. I wanted to go down the slide so I started climbing the metal rungs. As I neared the top, I somehow lost all my grip and fell as time slowed. Somehow, as if I had been pushed off the tower itself, I managed to land on the grass a fair distance away and not the gravel and/or wooden plank edging that were immediately below the slide ladder.  Despite falling quite some distance I was unhurt, I think maybe the wind was knocked out of me as they say, but that was it. Weird."

I watched Kip Thorne today. He is the quantum physicist I first read when I was trying to figure out what the hell quantum physics was all about. He was a good teacher. I liked him.  He's working with the cgi guys on a movie called *Interstellar."" He keeps feeding them data and equations, and they keep generating images based on his input. He's ancient, bald, looks kinda like a friendly gnome. He's having the time of his life seeing new things, seeing how the cgi computers spin black holes around, how they interpret his data. He's as joyful as Saint Francis in a field of flowers.  He seems like a pure soul, living on the edge of what we know, and so happy.... I know you're right. I know how you feel. I'm not giving up until Kip Thorne does. Personal choice. No disrespect. Just don't want to yet."

In East Paktika I think their goal was to disable a vehicle, because that would plug the road, and then hit us with RPG's and PK's and AK's, then un-ass before CAS showed up.   Interesting that you have a SIGINT section along providing real-time intercept results.   We didn't, actually.  All of that info came from O-e via BFT.  My guess is that they were using cellphones.  As much as the Taliban supposedly hates modern technology, cell towers were never touched, and they were there.  Some of your descendants must have been working their black magic somewhere.  Thanks.  Looking forward to more from you."
MilitaryStories,2k647t,kombatminipig,4,Sat Oct 25 01:19:26 2014 UTC,"cell towers were never touched   Right there it is. I can't imagine the Tally had much in the way of encryption equipments, particularly at the tactical level. Anything that could scramble voice would be very expensive, plus it would likely come from some commercial firm such as Crypto AG and the last thing I read about them was they were in bed with the NSA. I can't say for sure if that is true but if so it means the crypto can't be trusted. There are maybe two or three such companies in the world, any other equipments would have to be supplied by a government, say russia. Keying would be another huge issue in such a remote region, that is having enough material on hand to frequently reprogram the crypto keys in their equipment. For instance we changed the key settings in our KY-8's every 12 hours in VN. So, two needed in each 24 hours, 14 a week, 56 a month times however many comm units in a network. In our case that would have been four units, so 224 key changes a month. I don't see that happening, the logistics of supplying crypto materials at the lower networks level quickly become impossible.  So they use cell phones and talk in the clear, probably using made up codewords and stilted language in an attempt to mask their meanings. Anyone used to copying that mission would quickly see through all that mumbo jumbo.   glad you guys had real-time signals support out there. The VC had the same problem, logistics played hell with their coding materials distribution so the lower level networks used pencil and paper cyphers a great deal. They chiefly used Morse for commo except they would switch to voice comm's immediately prior to and during attacks."
MilitaryStories,2k647t,treborr,3,Sat Oct 25 02:11:06 2014 UTC,"Indeed. As somebody who works in the crypto field, I can verify that GSM signals are amusingly simple to decrypt with today's technology (merely being considered troublesome back in the day when the standard was defined), mainly due to US government involvement. The keysize of the cipher (A5/1) was kept low on purpose, much to allow the NSA to perform realtime decryption. Today it can almost assuredly be done in the field."

A verbatim transcript is technically true, but untrue when it is read - that's NOT what was said or heard. And what they heard was, and is, the real story.

MilitaryStories,2jqott,Dittybopper,2,Tue Oct 21 02:56:00 2014 UTC,"Am I conflating my own actions?   Oh probably. I don't think you can tell these stories without doing that - it's a kind of physical limitation on effective story-telling. If it's any comfort, of all the story-tellers here, I think you are the least guilty of conflation and compression. When you're in the groove, you've got a kind of macho Proust/Joyce stream-of-consciousness thing going on.   Am I making these guys look like assholes?   That's a flat no. Except for the ones who were assholes. What comes through is a deep concern for the welfare of your people. Even now.

I've got the sand washed out.  It's just that I have a thing about not exaggerating, or conflating.

If you felt you had to be a hardass at times it is completely understandable and why not portray it just as you remember it. We all looked out for our buddies and sometimes that meant chewing some ass. Not only when they did, or we perceived them doing, something to endanger themselves but us. You had to keep alert for that stuff. I spent the night in a foxhole once with a fellow, our FSB was under ground attack and had been penetrated on one side, and he just wouldn't shut up! Talking loudly all the time to the point that I seriously thought about just killing him before he gave our position away. Glad I didn't but damn him still."
MilitaryStories,2jqott,UT_Axon,3,Tue Oct 21 13:13:33 2014 UTC,"Well, I'm going to take that as a promise of stuck vehicle stories. I do like me some stuck vehicle stories. Don't have any of my own (and touch wood that I'm never on a ship that some dumbarse ship driver puts up onto the sand) but army mates have shared a few, and the best ones always include the recovery vehicles also getting bogged.  Anyway. You really do know how to build suspense for the rest of us, don't you?   And your bear sounds really cool. Did most guys end up with some sort of talisman/item that they routinely carried? It's not as significant as your bear, but I've got a carved fish hook necklace which hasn't missed a sea day. It's a Kiwi thing, not Aussie, and it's meant to have some protective effect for travel over water. Rarely wear it (because I'm not a fan of any sort of dangly girly crap, and I don't even wear my watch on my wrist because it annoys me) but I carry it."
MilitaryStories,2jqott,snimrass,4,Mon Oct 20 02:38:01 2014 UTC,"Stuck vehicle story!  We were on a night-fire exercise with NVG's and laser-sights and all the good stuff.   We set up camp behind the range in a small forest where we would spend 2 nights.  I was the guardcommander and stayed in the camp together with a small group, to make sure nobody stole anything or whatever. Whilst the recruits were at the range an E-5 buddy of mine showed up in one of these. As you can imagine these things aren't worth a damn thing off road, because it's FWD only.  There was a gravel-road that was used for foresting I think, and it ended right by our campsite.  There was no way he would be able to turn, because there were trees right next to both sides of the road, and in front was the hilltop, from where a small path led down to the range. (There was an actual road to the range, but the foresting-road was closer to the campsite) Well, there was this little open field to the left of the road.....   I didn't really pay attention to what he was doing next, I was busy discussing something with my other E-5 buddy (there were a LOT of E-5's in that company) when suddenly we heard a noise.  It was the noise of an engine reving at it's maximum capability.  Oh, have I mentioned that it was raining all day?   So we get to the vehicle and no surprise, it is stuck beyond help. The mud was so deep that the undercarriage of the vehicle basically was on the forest-floor. Shit, what do?  All we had were some transport Vehicles, but there was no way to pull the VW out in a normal fashion, because there wasn't enough space.   I drew our solution in mspaint.  Imagine this scenario in a forest, at 1AM, with headlights of 3 vehicles as our only lightsource, whilst it's raining like hell. Our main concern was that the towbar of our anchor-vehicle would break, but it actually worked out fine. Needless to say we had to be quick, because the PL would return to the campsite any minute, and we really couldn't be bothered to catch heat."
MilitaryStories,2jqott,snimrass,3,Mon Oct 20 12:20:14 2014 UTC,"Heh. Yeah, that's a pretty good stuck vehicle story, and of course that sort of situation always takes place at 0100, in the rain, with no real lighting. Have to ask though - how exactly did your buddy end up with VW on the range to begin with?  And if you've got more stories where that came from, write it up and submit it! The American guys tend to dominate just because there's more of them around reddit, but it'll be good to see some more international variety. Doesn't have to be long or serious either."
MilitaryStories,2jqott,Dittybopper,4,Mon Oct 20 22:25:58 2014 UTC,"I have no idea what he was thinking. If I recall correctly he had to drive someone to the barracks. He was probably too lazy to just park it at the normal range parkinglot, and just wanted to be at the campsite quicker. The vehicle was originally used to drive cadre to meetings and back to the field.  Yeah I have a couple of smaller stories, most of them are from basic and a few are from actual missions (all within Switzerland, we don't have a lot of guys abroad), I'll think about writing them up."
MilitaryStories,2jqott,Dittybopper,2,Tue Oct 21 07:23:55 2014 UTC,"Talismans.  Important little things.  Probably a lot of guys did.  It wasn't really anything anybody asked anybody about.  I had a tiny little pink mouse patch, about the size of a nickel, that I sewed onto my gear.  My girlfriend had given it to me before I left for Afghanistan.  My pet name for her was Mouse.  Nobody ever looked at it twice or asked what it was about, or why it was there.  I think things like that were immediately recognized, and left alone."

MilitaryStories,2jol2b,moving0target,16,Sun Oct 19 10:35:58 2014 UTC,"Clearly this is an issue for you. I grew up hearing all kinds of military stories, mostly Air Force. It seemed normal on Saturday night to see a gang of men and women smoking and drinking cocktails and laughing while one of them waved his hands in the air to illustrate the funniest dogfight he was ever in.   Gets in your head that service is normal. I think it should be normal. But sometimes you gotta think outside the box.  I joined the Army. It was a cold calculation - my Dad told me that most AF guys who fly, fly in airborne trucks carrying shit from here to there. My chances of being a fighter pilot were less than none, plus - despite what you see on TV - there were damned few dogfights going on in Vietnam. I wanted to go see the beast, so Army. (Apologies to the Marines. I had no idea they were in Vietnam. There are no Marines in Colorado Springs.)  But here's the point - service is where you find it. I had one daughter do a couple of essentially boring years in the IDF. The other joined the Peace Corps right out of college. The Peace Corps is mean. They want to know if you're going to quit, and they want to know right now. So within days of entering service, she found herself alone in a mud-hut village, no phone, no electricity, no water, no sewage in the deep bush outside of Sikasso, Mali. She had no Bambara, little French, and only one villager spoke broken English.  She served two years - service that I'll wager was tougher and more rigorous and challenging and difficult than the service of, say, 85% of the co-temporal military tours some of her peers were enduring.   Was that not service to her country? I think it was. Scared the piss outta me. Brave girl.   For those of you who hate loose ends, she not only survived, but prevailed. In a year she was the Queen of Mali, confidently traveled the countryside, spoke pretty good Bambara and was otherwise a surprise and delight to the Malians. Did them some good, did her country some good, and did herself a lot of good. Didn't blow anything up. I think that gives her service a leg up on mine.  So OP, if you have to serve to feel better, and you can't do what you want, you can can still do what you can. Sounds like you're doing that. Pride in service is one thing. Bragging rights is not the same thing. You're serving. Be proud."
MilitaryStories,2jol2b,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Sun Oct 19 15:43:37 2014 UTC,"Salient words as always.  I tried to get into the Peace Corps, by the way.  Turns out there are a lot of folks who try to get in.  Not having a college degree pretty much instantly disqualified me.  I think it would have been one of those things where there was a lot of misery in the moment, but I'd look back with pride and realize just how much fun I'd had without realizing it.  I found a way to serve.  I have a wife and kid.  I take pride in caring for and leading my family.  That's good enough for me.  You still wonder about the paths you didn't take, though.  Incidentally, I wanted to be a pilot, too.  20/600 vision disqualified me from even flying shit haulers."

Snimrass is right, the military isn't all that for reasons that I'm too lazy to get into right now. Not saying it's bad at all, but it comes with the same nuances as any subculture. Be proud of your family's service, but it's most important to be proud of your own accomplishments as well."

That aside don't sweat the small stuff, a man with children making a marriage work is what life is about, kudo's to you sir. There's some pretty interesting stories in that too I'll wager."

Military kids who join the ADF will likely cop shit their entire career, if anything - they're never going to get a posting without some bitter person wondering if it was daddy who got them a job.   Found out after he died that my Granddad served in the army as a cook - this is only really of concern to me because I wished I'd known the grumpy old bastard better before he kicked the bucket. My great Grandpa served during WW2. It's only a matter of concern because of the impact it had on my Grandpa. My military career doesn't hinge on their service. It's just footnotes in family history, not the be-all and end-all of my life.  Sorry man, I'm being too much of a prick. Hope you're having a good life. Military ain't all its cracked up to be.

Usually all it takes is a ""friendly reminder"" that unlike their father/5th cousin/whoever, they are not a Command Sergeant Major and are subject to the same rules as everyone else and they'll go about their day with a grumpy look on their face."

I think I did overstate what I was trying to say - there really is a different perspective between Australia and America. We don't laud the military the way you do over there. I didn't mean any offence to your family or their service, and I am sorry that came across that way. Similarly, I didn't mean to minimise the service of my family members.   And I didn't mean to imply that your grandfather would have eased your way, although it can and does happen - that comment was made with some friends of mine in mind.  Still. Don't regret not serving. There's better things in life than a uniform. And AM has a very good point when he says that we service is where you find it. You've got a wife and kid who you obviously care a lot about - that family connection really is more important than the uniform."

MilitaryStories,2jol2b,Dittybopper,5,Fri Nov 14 02:12:09 2014 UTC,"Well, you can see my reply to the OP's comment, but I'm guessing your mind is made up.  Honestly, I don't give a shit if you think I'm a dick. Have whatever opinion you want. But I wanted to say that my service hasn't sucked. There are things I have done in this job that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. There are people who I have served with who I know I can trust to always have my back. But I'm not so blind to think that military service is always sunshine and rainbows. I'm not an idiot.  OP has taken a different path, and he has a wife and kid. That's worth a lot, and the military would certainly fuck with that. My partner and I both serve - last year, between both of our deployments and time away from home, we spent two months together. This year, which is meant to be a year together, had me travel away from home half a dozen times, and him almost as many. He's now gone away for another month. Next year we'll be back to hardly seeing each other. Kids are not on the cards for a while.  I was having a bad night in a bad week. Don't take that as any sort of apology to you, because it's certainly not intended that way. As I said, have whatever opinion you want. I'll stand by what I said, with the minor concession that I worded it harshly."
MilitaryStories,2jol2b,Dittybopper,3,Sun Oct 19 19:24:59 2014 UTC,"Completely off topic and highly personal, but your wording made me curious.  You use the word ""partner"" which, in the US generally implies a homosexual relationship.  If that's the case, what is military service in AU like?  Does anyone even notice or care?  I'm curious because only fairly recently did we get rid of that don't ask/don't tell bullshit in the US.  As long as the US military has been around, I doubt enough time has elapsed for there have been much of a cultural shift.  If I'm out of line here, just ignore me."
MilitaryStories,2jol2b,Dittybopper,5,Sun Oct 19 19:54:00 2014 UTC,"Nope, all good. I'm female. He's more than a boyfriend, given the time we've been together, but we're not planning on getting married. So ""partner"" gets used to indicate a serious relationship that isn't a marriage. De facto just sounds weird, although I guess I could use that. I know that everyone assumes I'm male, and I don't correct it until it becomes an issue. Easier than being known as female on the internet. I haven't had my inbox flooded with dick pics yet, and I'm happy for it to stay that way.  We never had a don't ask, don't tell type of policy that I know of. As it currently stands, I know a number of openly gay currently serving personnel. No one cares, and if anyone is homophobic they get called out on it and brought into line pretty damn quickly. That sort of shit isn't acceptable.   Honestly? The only problems I've seen with people's sexual relationships is when it gets brought into the workplace. Although everyone knows that'll happen. A whole bunch of young people crowded in one place, generally with too much booze? There's a reason the medics hand out condoms, and it's not just for visits to the lady boys in Thailand."

So I'm here to say that I got nuthin' to say. Except this:  I was readin' along, frowning at the computer, concentrating, okay we're in Iraq, it's night, you're point, no NVGs, yes, I see, yes...  Then I tripped and fell across a piano wire of information strung across my path. Herpes?! He named that cute little bitch Herpes?  Cracked me up. Good thing I didn't have a mouth full of coffee. Okay. the mood is broken. Bad dogs, huh? Sick Herpes on 'em. Watch 'em run.   And breaking the mood was the right thing to do, because we're gonna end up on a dirt road in Pennsylvania about to cap a Dachshund.  Nice writing. Thank you. I enjoyed it. I don't know exactly why everyone here is being so serious. For four decades now I've been rousting various women out of bed because I heard a ""thoop thoop"" mortar-like noise, and I scrambled out of bed cursing that my compass - which I wore around my neck on a string - was NOT where it should be and what the motherfunkin' what is goin' the fuck on, and ""INCOMING!"" It ruined some relationships. Made the others more lively.   Yeah, that was an overlay - two versions of reality showing on the same screen. I get 'em when I'm camping mostly. Not so intense. But I notice that in the woods, if they hear something strange, my girls take a knee, get quiet and scan.   It can just be funny. Not sure you should be carrying a gun on back roads just yet. Not one that's handy. But that's your choice. What's one wiener dog more or less?  What's the name of your Husky? Tell me it's something fun.

It took me a while to get used to.  I had a few moments of ""CRASH"" that left me pretty rattled and catching myself taking a knee or starting to run across the yard.  It doesn't even phase me now.  The worst was in front of a co-worker, the neighbors dropped a car, and my lizard brain thought (for about one or two whole seconds) that we were taking 107's or an IED.  My co-worker thought it was funny, and why shouldn't he?  I was keyed up for the rest of the day, and embarrassed too.  I was also kind of pissed that he thought it was funny, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that he had no frame of reference.  That sound didn't mean to him what it meant to me.  He didn't get a huge brain-dump of fighting cocktails.  He didn't spend the next hour or three or four jumping at the slightest things.  He didn't have to stick his hands in his pockets because they were shaking so badly.  I don't know where I was going with this.  I guess recollecting, but I get it. For years all I had were bad dreams.  Most of them weren't even nightmares, but just bad dreams.  It was always people trying to kill me.  I never remembered the nightmares, just waking up to a soaking wet mattress and sheets and pillow.  I don't have those very often anymore.  Sometimes I actually have good dreams now.  Anyway, I hope you're doing okay.  It does get better, Brother."
MilitaryStories,2jkhy6,SoThereIwas-NoShit,7,Sat Oct 18 02:44:05 2014 UTC,"Right there it is!   Not many months after I returned from VN Dad, mom and I were strolling in downtown Atlanta when a truck backfired and I dove into a shop doorway balling up in a kind of fetal position with my arms covering my head. Dad laughed, mom had this pinched look on her face. I felt like a damned fool as I rose. That startle reaction is still present, loud noises rattle my cage to this day. I don't dive to the ground any longer but if and when I'm startled by bod is instantly flooded with adrenaline and I have the briefest impulse to ""hit the dirt or hit back."" Best way I can describe it. I've come to hate that and the adrenaline dump which leaves me shaking and mad at both  whatever made the sudden noise, and myself, for reacting to that shit still. It takes me a little while to calm back down as the quessy knot in my stomach settles. Its unsettling but there it is, there is nothing you can do.   Back during that period too, for a year or so after returning, I had this waking walking fantasy that I was being tracked over the sights of a weapon. Anytime I walked past a window or was outdoors the feeling was there, I felt that at any second someone was going to shoot at me. Sometimes I couldn't make myself go outdoors. It was obvious where the feeling came from because it had actually happened during my tour; some ass did track me over his sights and did shoot at me, so I had a learned response that followed me home where walking down the city street or strolling in some suburb there was no actual danger of it happening. My mind wasn't buying logic however, it stood guard just like it had learned to do half a world away.   My point is, finally, that these startle reactions and flashbacks will fade in time but there is a spot in your lower brain positively grooved with that survival response and it will kick in for the rest of your life when sudden encounters or noises trip it. You just have to learn to deal with it. Counselling is a positive beginning to understanding how PTSD works, therapy can give you the tools to fight its effects, do it. You will be glad you did."

I returned from the war in November, the opening day of deer season was only a few days off and despite my aversion to joining the hunt (I knew I wasn't going to kill anything) I eventually consented because dad and his buddies kept insisting I join and our hunting trips had alway been a tradition. I went and it was a mistake for me to be walking in the woods armed plus it felt strange. I came within a split second of shooting another hunter who happened to be sitting off the path I was on, he moved. I caught that movement out of the corner of my eye and in a flash I had him covered and was pulling the trigger. I didn't finish the pull but stood there and shook all over as he stared at me. I unloaded the rifle, went back to camp, and didn't go hunting again for a very long time. Fact is I was ""back there"" as I walked alone on that path that morning but wasn't conscious of that, I had no business being there. So, watch yourself and guns for a while."

All I remember was that he was from the Aloweeset tribe, and I couldn't tell you why I remember that.  Dude that got ass-shot would've been MEDEVAC'd, or just taken by the Grunts that shot him to wherever wounded prisoners went.  The guys in the SUV seemed legit, not that it would have been hard to fake it.  Things were pretty weird.  We were demoing some cluster-bombs in a guys orchard once, and the owner met us at the front gate.  He had his own security guys with Kalashnikov's and all of that shit.  He'd been living in the States for years, and had just moved back.  He came across as a mover and a shaker, but that was the way all of those fuckers acted.  It was something you kind of worked around.  SF had set up the precursor to the ICDC's while the ""War"" was still going, which were the precursor to the IA, which didn't exist when I was there.  All in all, it was really confusing.  We had a detail to go to a meeting between some Kurds, I couldn't tell you what we were there for, but we were there.  They all looked like a bunch of gangsters.  I mean gold chains and rings, sunglasses and expensive looking clothes, fat bellies and nice shoes, top shirt buttons undone and hairy as hell.  Sun glasses and Mercedes and BMW's and Kalashnikovs.  The house looked like something you'd see in a movie about coke dealers in South America.  It was weird, and it skeezed me out.

They knew I was a Sergeant, but in the Iraq of the time, culturally speaking, NCO's weren't looked on by the LN's as having any real autonomy.  I used that to not offend them.  I'd tell them I'd been given strict orders by my Officers.  They would acknowledge that as me being a ""good Sergeant"", and it would actually garner respect.  All the while, as the ranking man in that situation, I had full control and it was left to my discretion.

As a lowly Buck Sergeant I probably had more operational freedom than a Company Commander in the Republican Guard had when we were fighting them.  I think this is an idea about actual responsibility that's ingrained in western military, whereas middle-eastern militaries like to appear, they can't get over their top-heavy rank structure and the hand-me-downs of their Soviet trainers from decades ago.  I think the unwillingness of the Communist military mind-set to allow any deviation from the Plan meshed perfectly with the cultural preoccupations of rank and status over realistic goals, to end up with a military that isn't goal oriented.  We're seeing this now with IS, who're seemingly adaptable, but not at all a viable conventional fighting force.  Any time they met western forces, under any of their previous incarnations, they were destroyed.  The fact that they're operating so freely means that they aren't fighting a cohesive conventional army.

In this they follow the example of their political leaders, who not only withhold information from their own allies, but routinely deceive them. Training in Arab armies reflects this: rather than prepare as much as possible for the multitude of improvised responsibilities that are thrown up in the chaos of battle, Arab soldiers, and their officers, are bound in the narrow functions assigned them by their hierarchy.

MilitaryStories,2ja604,snimrass,2,Wed Oct 15 04:02:06 2014 UTC,"I think the whole point of the Boards, for us anyway, weren't so much as testing your tactical and technical knowledge, as they were about seeing how you acted under pressure.  I mean, getting grilled by the Sergeant Major and all of the First Shirts, fuck me.  Those are the people you only really interact with if you've seriously fucked up, when you're a Joe.  If you do everything right, you only ever give them courtesies in passing mostly.  Even if it's your own First Sergeant."
MilitaryStories,2ja604,snimrass,3,Sat Oct 18 01:51:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's really the same for us, otherwise they'd just settle for a paper exam where you could just list off rules and publications. Still have to do that in the board, but they want you to do it while they're throwing curve balls at you and changing things as you go to see how you'd react. No point having an engineer who is really technically knowledgeable but doesn't have the balls to stand up to the CO and tell him that his ""really good idea"" is actually fucking retarded and will put plant and personnel at risk (if it comes to that - most COs are getting better but some still want to be cowboys).  The bloke who chaired my qual board was an 05, who had come up the enlisted ranks to Warrant Officer before commissioning. He is a fucking hardarse, and back in the bad old days had a reputation for wall-to-wall counselling. Great engineer though, and a lot of experience.  He's not someone that you would want to be called up to meet when you knew you'd fucked up."
MilitaryStories,2ja604,AnathemaMaranatha,7,Sat Oct 18 02:00:45 2014 UTC,"Well shoot. The only promotion I remember was from 2LT to 1LT. No board. I was due for the rank a year out of OCS, 3 July 1968. Orders should have come down then - I had gone out and bought (stole? commandeered? - don't remember) a silver bar. Wasn't going to put it on until I got orders.  About three weeks later, I made it back to my Battalion at Quang Tri. S1 (another LT from my OCS class) stuck his head out of his tent/office, ""Hey, Maranatha! Did you know you're a first lieutenant now? Congratulations! Me too.""  That was my ceremony. I like yours better OP. There should be blood and pain, or how else you gonna remember the important stuff?  Come to think of it - and I'm just making this connection now - there was some of that. I'll be damned. I'm re-writing a story about my promotion day - have been for a month or so. It'll be called ""The Third of July.""   Never thought about that part of it. God, this is a strange subreddit. Weird connections. Wheels inside of wheels. Love from the bottom to the top. Fuck me. My mind is blown.  Thanks, OP. I owe you."

There were no questions relating to my MOS O58 as there was no one on the board with the Need To Know even though everyone on the board had the required security clearance. I suspect my Trick Chief at Ops had gave his grudging OK for my promotion based on my work at Ops. In a couple of weeks I was handed the promotion orders. No one pinned anything on me, no ceremony, business as usual. The pay raise enabled me to raise even more hell in town.  ""made-in-iraq ""whiskey"", and I use the term very loosely. It was Brown, it said whiskey in English and a bunch of other shit in Gulf Arabi,""  Oh god... On Okinawa there was a brand of saki sold only to GI's, it was vile and only they would drink it. 28 cents a quart, a Typhoon fifth we called it. That stuff would put a hurt on yo ass."

That Iraqi shit was the worst, but beggars can't be choosers.  We ended up getting Syrian whiskey, called Cassandra, later.  It was better.  We drank a lot of that.  Johnny's girlfriend mailed him a bottle of Absolut Citron.  After drinking Cassandra with gatorade for chasers, that vodka went down like water.  I think four of us killed it in about five minutes.  We were drinking a lot.  No idea how we didn't ever get caught."
MilitaryStories,2ja604,djabelek,5,Sat Oct 18 01:22:06 2014 UTC,"Well, technically a Typhoon Fifth was the bottle of whatever you kept it your locker in case you got stuck in the barracks during a typhoon. Oki got quite a few of those. When one struck you either got stuck in Ops doing 12on/12off shifts or in the barracks because you couldn't be outside in a typhoon. We were authorized the booze in our lockers which wasn't a locker but a closet. We called the Shuri Saki Typhoon Filth because of what it did to you, both when imbibing and the next day. Saki makes for a mean drunk at times, shit will make you lose your pea'pick'n mind."

The embarrassment, the anxiety would have prevented me from *performing as ordered.""   During my basic training I came down with an intestinal disease, it was pretty severe and  I ended up in the hospital for a few days. During one exam, a barium x-ray procedure, the attending nurse was a dark haired beauty with steel blue eyes. A knock out who's perfume was intoxicating. Despite every contrary effort I was developing a boner, I tried distracting myself with thoughts of anything other than that curvy nurse standing with her back to me momentarily, but little Junior had ides of his own. When the nurse turned her attention back to me as I'm sitting on the x-ray table she immediately noticed my condition and without a pause reached out and thumped the base of my member, flips it with her thumb and forefinger like you'd flip a breadcrumb off a table. It died then and there and without a word the exam proceeded. To say I was speechless, burning with embarrassment and red faced to the core would be a huge understatement.

My friend and I were on the way to Baltimore one evening and stopped for a brew in a roadhouse next to the highway. We sit down at the bar and ordered, my friend asks the girl for a light for his cig. She leans in and gives him the light but when she raises up says in a loud voice ""You want to do WHAT with me!"" She did this to piss off her boyfriend sitting next to her. Next thing I know and very quickly a brawl is on and my buddy is taking some early shitkicking so I jump in, literally, I got on the bar and dove into the fight. He and I are fighting a rear-guard action, backing toward the exit as we fended off four or five guys and the girl. We make it out the door and run for our car, my VW.   I realize I've dropped my wallet... damn. I decide to risk going in and finding it. I do, the bartender has them settled somewhat and tells me to find the wallet fast and get the hell out. I spot it and go to retrieve it, the girl comes over and starts in on me verbally, trash talk. I put the wallet in my back pocket and then kicked her square in the twat, hard as I could and hit the door running hard. My buddy had the car waiting so all I had to do was hop in as he drove off... they chased us but we avoided capture..."

You guys make a big deal of promotion traditions. Not that we don't make a big deal of it for our guys, particularly when it starts getting selective. But the embarrassment is normally limited to the CO reading your middle name out in front of the whole ship's company, and getting laughed at for some pretty rusty drill. The lucky guys know when it's coming.  I could have used some warning when I was presented my Commissioning Certificate (it takes years for those things to get signed by the GG, let alone actually catch up with us). I looked like a mess for it, and of course the picture ended up in the newsletter that got sent home to spouses and family. We had a Clear Lower Deck to do some presentations while we were out at sea on a border protection patrol. I'd sprained my ankle a couple of days prior, wasn't bad enough for me to be sent ashore but I was wearing sneakers rather than our steel cap boots and was still hobbling about like a cripple (so I was late to the whole thing too). Because it was warm and humid, most of us were just in undershirts and pants, which while more practical also looks pretty sloppy at times. And my hair was a mess because it was windy. Jammed someone else's ball cap on over the top so I could salute the CO. Man, I looked like shit.  Ah well. At least I shouldn't be on the receiving end of any presentations in the foreseeable future. Nice little dit their Grinder. Good to have some light stuff every so often."

That's not a bad thing - see Wolf - but Lord, it is a challange.   You are the reason I walked point, even though I had no business doing so. I wasn't scared - I felt stupid and unqualified compared to the sharp-eyed, sharp-eared, wide-nostrilled, natural-born scouts who excelled at the job. I got tired of hearing, ""Yeah, but did you ever walk point?"" Yeah, I did. I was bad at it. I shouldn't have done it either. I let some trash-talking grunty-grunt get my back up, and I did a stupid thing. Bad El Tee.  I pulled rank to get off the CP chopper and on the first chopper into every LZ - I thought I needed to be on the ground ASAP. I was on the last chopper out of any PZ when we were lifting into a safe LZ. Same reason. My people. They were deliberately deploying infantry companies as bait, 75 to 125 guys in the woods alone. The idea was to lure the enemy out where the artillery and air could mess them up. That didn't work if the Forward Observer took the first chopper back to the hot chow line.  You're right about everything. That's what rank looks like. I was an E2 11B before I was an LT. It looked that way when I was an LT too. It's always gonna look that way in garrison, for sure, but in combat too. And mostly, it is that way.  But that's not what it's supposed to be. I saw enough good officers and NCOs to understand that.

In Afghanistan I was with the Guard, and we were a good unit, but there wasn't the level of training or unit cohesion that active duty had, and we got in more fights and did more ""how the fuck did nobody get killed?"" stuff.  Gawd damn, you almost got me into writing out a whole story!  Your posts are just damned good and pull everybody out of the woodwork.  Where's the Shaman and the Squid, anyways?"

It was a proud thing to see that.   I totally believe this. Y'all were trained as an elite unit. 82nd always has been.   Goddamndest best feeling in the world.

MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,just_foo,9,Mon Oct 13 08:04:00 2014 UTC,"Loved your story.  I hope you don't mind but I copied it and posted it to facebook for my fellow soldiers to read.  As far as my own thinking on rank, being enlisted 16 years and counting.. hmm  Well, here's how I view the difference between a good NCO and a bad one.  I spent 2008 in Baghdad with an MP company doing patrols, training local police and for part of the year helping with election stations and the surge refugees from Sadr City (we were stationed a couple blocks south of there near the Martyrs monument)    One morning some CSM that used to be the CSM for the unit we replaced was hanging around watching one of our squads do their pre-mission brief and check PCCs/PCIs.  Basically soaking up the attention he was getting.  I'm sure he is a nice guy, and earned his stripes.  Don't get me wrong.  The thing that bugged me was two other jr. enlisted and I were sitting on the gravel nearby waiting for something, I can't remember why, and he spotted us.  He came wandering over kinda beeboping I guess. Trying to do it really nonchalant.  We took this as he was just relaxed or bored.  He never directly approached us, just wandered somewhat closeby.  We stayed sitting, although of course got quiet, and kept an eye on him.  He then proceeded to suddenly flip shit on us about rank and how he used to be the CSM for this mission once too and all this.  Again, I have no problem with that.  But it bugs me that looking back now it's obvious he was just kinda self congratulating and testing us.  The way he acted before getting mad totally threw us off.  We were all set to jump up at parade rest and everything but he made it confusing.      Anyway, so that's an example of the dumb shit that happens.  On the other end of the spectrum, my Op Sgt there was basically a walking genius.  The type that has so much knowledge and experience under his belt the military should be begging him to take his commission.  He's now a CSM running a school here on camp.  But he is one of the wisest and nicest sergeants I have ever met.  Knows how to get shit done and get people to get shit done. He makes you WANT to do your job, and do it well.  The kind of guy you feel like treating with respect because he earned it.     He's the one who pinned my CAB on my chest and I just asked him the other day if I could use him as a reference on an application.  He said ""I would be honored"".  That made my day.       Rank has nothing to do with how good of a soldier you are.  It should, but it usually doesn't.   In his case, it does."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,Gnashtaru,11,Mon Oct 13 12:40:13 2014 UTC,"Loved your story. I hope you don't mind but I copied it and posted it to facebook for my fellow soldiers to read.   ? No problem. I'm on FB the minimum amount of time I can manage. Don't get it, I guess. Pass on a geezer ""Yo!"" to your troops.  I have written several stories about senior NCOs, and what a difference they can make. The ones I met in the field were the ones who did not thrive in the rear areas - bad politicians, bad tempers, inability to not tell the CSM just where he could put his stripes. The field was punishment. No way to get noticed and promoted in the field.  So we would get these E6s and E7s exiled to the bush, still a little hung over, missing the booze but not the bullshit. It was a godsend - years of experience. We were pretty good without them. With them, we were great. Young soldiers will listen to an older soldier. My platoon sergeant was older'n dirt, called me ""Sir"" like it hurt him to do so. I did everything he said."

I ran a state-department dude out there one day in late 2008/early 2009 and I remember being a little, uh, uncomfortable when the Bradley at the ECP swung the turret over and flagged my MRAP with the 25mm.  Anyway, we always liked running out to that COP because they had an ungodly supply of SHOCK coffee and were happy to share. My guys would be like ""We gotta go to Sadr City again?! Shit. Well, at least we'll be able to resupply on SHOCK."" It was seriously a morale boost. I still don't really understand it. I also don't really understand it how we couldn't get the stuff at our FOB, which was essentially in the green zone. Anyway - if that was you out there at that COP, thanks for being generous with all your caffeine-fortified coffee."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,Dittybopper,2,Mon Oct 13 12:49:57 2014 UTC,LOL well that's the right time period.  I was at Shield from about April through Jan 2008/9.  But we didn't have a bradley at a gate.  We had towers and contractors for guards.  I know Rusty (rustamiya) had an APC for a gate...  I also don't remember shock coffee... we had tons of those mini Rip-Its though!    God I loved those.  And Wild Tiger energy drinks... and kit-kats with a white wrapper and red logo made by nestle I believe.  Yep.. just checked.  .  EDIT:  We were about two blocks south of Sadr.  Near that lake/pond.  Our A/O was Bab-al-sheikh and Sadr.  http://imgur.com/a/LE1W1#0
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,Dittybopper,3,Mon Oct 13 19:45:32 2014 UTC,"Ah. This got my curiosity up, so I went and checked my archives. The incident w/ the Brad would have been on Feb 16 or Jun 28 of 2009. Those were the two times that I personally was on the run out there. It was a tiny little COP called ""Comanche"" that was about 2k NNE from your position at Shields:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B021'07.5%22N+44%C2%B026'37.1%22E/@33.3516326,44.4452551,874m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0  At some points, it was in a different Brigade battlespace than FOB shields, so it might have been out of your AO.  We did plenty of runs out to Shields also. All my memories of Shields seem to involve getting yelled at. I had a run-in there with a CSM who was incensed that we didn't stop and clear weapons at his clearing barrels. We were attached to the State Department doing PSD and we were not allowed to clear weapons until we'd delivered our principal back home safe and sound and were end-of-mission. He was really unhappy to hear that and proclaimed his opinion at great length.  I had another run-in with some major at Shields. Y'all were doing some kind of engagement activity just outside your perimeter. I just got a mission sheet that said ""Take so and so to this building at this time"" and the building was an Iraqi facility just outside of FOB Shields. I had no idea what the event was or that people from Shields had come out the day before and set up an additional security perimeter around this site. So when we got there, I kept the principals sitting in the HMMWV while I set my advance party in to scout the meeting site, establish DM positions, etc. Well this pissed the hell out of some major who got all in my face angry that we were treating his event like it wasn't secure. I let him yell at me while my guys carried on according to our well-rehearsed SOP and they'd finished before the major was done chewing on me.  Glad to run into another Guardsman who had the same stomping grounds that I did."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,kallekilponen,2,Mon Oct 13 19:57:43 2014 UTC,"Hmm I recognise the name Comanche but I can't remember where that was.    Yea Shield was pretty much nothing but brass and alphabet soup except for our unit.  Had Blackwater there too, although I think they called themselves something else by then.  Those guys were friggin massive, but nice from what little interaction I had with them.  They never really talked about what they did there.  Big surprise.  LOL  There were some guys from MNSTCI (the skull patch for Lukes Spooks in my pics) that were really awesome.  We did their commo and maint all year since they had no support section of their own.  Got an AAM for that from their full bird.    Yea life on Shield was.. interesting.  We had it pretty good though.  I gained like 10 pounds because the chow was great.  haha"
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,kallekilponen,5,Mon Oct 13 20:57:38 2014 UTC,"As always /u/AM a most excellent tale well told. I can totally confirm that VC trick because I once witnessed it being pulled on a company of infantry my team was collocated with. Unfortunately they didn't have a wise officer to hold them back from sending a patrol to investigate when the green tracers criss-crossed our perimeter late one evening. The fire came from two directions and from the vicinity of a village perhaps 800 yards off. It was brief, a few bursts from each machine gun, then a few more. The patrol, a full platoon, went out but found nothing stumbling around in the dark, They cleared the village and started their way back to our position but soon encountered booby traps galore. The VC had accurately surmised their likely return route, snuck in behind them and rigged a nasty night for the platoon. Several killed, more wounded and the operation dragged on all night recovering the dead and wounded and extracting the platoon from the mess."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,kallekilponen,6,Tue Oct 14 02:59:20 2014 UTC,"Ugh. Worst-case scenario. Who would send out a patrol to investigate something clearly designed by the enemy to provoke investigation? Trip wires in the dark - nightmare time.  Makes me wonder - maybe you know - what was the VC grapevine? Were they using radio to pass on all these nifty tricks, or did they just have lodge meetings? I mean, I encountered the same trick 250 miles apart."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,kallekilponen,4,Mon Oct 13 14:48:06 2014 UTC,"I honestly do not how how the trick was disseminated within the VC ranks, I doubt it was via radio. I'm betting it was an oldie passed down in their lore and probably the French were pulled in the same way.  You were down in III Corps weren't you? Same area the one I witnessed occurred in. Who would send a patrol out under that circumstance, good question but again I don't know the answer. What I remember is seeing the tracers arc over and seeking cover then hearing the MGs off in the distance. Then watching the patrol gear up and leave. A couple of hours later I heard them on the company net saying they had found nothing; the next thing I hear is them reporting they had ran into a booby trap, then another and another. They had casualties and wanted Medevac... it went on and on."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,tomyrisweeps,3,Mon Oct 13 15:20:27 2014 UTC,First time I saw it was in I Corps outside of Hue. 2nd time was over a year later 250 miles south up southwest of Saigon. Maybe they were using carrier pigeons.

I‚Äôm very sorry. I will never do that again.""   Reading this made me once again realize how different military etiquette is in different countries. One of the first things we were taught in the Finnish army was that you never ever say ""sorry"" to your CO. You learn from your mistakes, you make it clear you realize you've screwed up and know not to do it again, but you never apologize. (Your mistake might in some cases endanger lives, and in that case ""sorry"" doesn't cut it. It's more important to learn than seek forgiveness.)"
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,snimrass,3,Mon Oct 13 17:38:39 2014 UTC,"You learn from your mistakes, you make it clear you realize you've screwed up and know not to do it again, but you never apologize.    Interesting. I don't know that I said ""I'm sorry"" twice. Might have said it once. Might have said it three times. I was sorry. That was the truth of the matter. This was an officer who had made me part of his team, entrusted me with his business, some of which included endangering the lives of his troops. That was an honor for me.  Okay I understand the bit about making sure your superior knows that you understand your error, that you've learned from your mistake and that it won't happen again. For sure, I wanted my captain to know that. I also wanted him to know I was sorry. I wasn't looking to be forgiven. I was expecting, at the very least, to be fired.  I dunno. Is this some phlegmatic Finnish thing? Seems odd - some kind of faux machismo ""never apolologize, never explain."" I don't see the point."

He perpetuates the stereotype and wasn't a good soldier; let alone a good leader. Luckily, with how I was treated in Iraq (forgotten by my unit after I was tasked out to other organizations) and being mentored by a good Master Sergeant. I learned that rank isn't about pulling one over on someone or using it for privileges; rather it is to be used to help guide/mentor those under my command and to help them from getting shafted by the big, bad Army.  I also knew a SGM who had the military spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars to get his room extended in Iraq knowing full well that they were going to turn the base back over to the Iraqi Army in a few months. Rank has it's privileges"

I was more of a technician, a rainmaker. We had lots of square-jawed type LTs who would lead you through hell and back. Not me. As the unit exited Hell, I'd be the guy the square-jawed LT was dragging by the collar, who was yelling, ""Wait, man! I got an eight digit fix on the south gate of Dis! I can blow that mofo up! C'mon, man, just give me another 30 minutes! It'll be great!""  I was also that 2LT you mentioned. We all were. 2LT isn't a rank, it's a condition. Some recover. Others don't.  Yeah, I saw enough soldiers living off the ""privileges"" of rank. I dunno. Wars mean lots of loose money. With that comes the OD mafia. They show up in every war, they bide their time in peace.

I'm loving the fact that I recently got out. I don't want a leader who will lead a charge straight into a MG nest.  It comes with the territory and I would say that 83% of LT's (First and Second) are good leaders who are doing what they think is right. The LT that I mentioned is the 17%. I've been in long enough to understand the roles of others as well as their personalities; this guy was hands down the worst Officer I've ever met.   If only you knew how much was spent with these last few wars. On a side note, I did get to enjoy surf and turf every friday consisting of steak and lobster tail. War is hell."

MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,tomyrisweeps,3,Mon Oct 13 14:11:02 2014 UTC,"Holding rank is weird and uncomfortable at times. I haven't been in combat, but I know there are decisions I have made that have had a significant impact on people's lives and careers. I've made decisions I know are 100% correct, but I also know that they will have a significant impact on an individual. But at the end of the day, I'm working for the ship and the task. I won't fuck over my guys, but I'm not going to put the safety of the vessel and other personnel at risk to cover something up.   I know that I don't get to walk past shit, even when I really fucking want to because I'm tired and over it and the day has gone on to long. It means that I'll continue having to tell men older than me to cut the crap and get on and do the job. And figure out how best to deal with the guy whose wife left him and is fucking someone else, and wants to off himself because he can't see things getting better, even when half of the feelings he's talking about I don't even know how to deal with myself.  It means knowing where ""the line"" is, and knowing how to enforce it. And knowing I face the consequences if I fuck that up.  And knowing full well that rank and position means that I may have to put guys in harm's way and not second guess that decision. We may not deal with incoming rounds, but peacetime incidents kill a lot of people in both navy and maritime industry. And dealing with a fire or flood is my part of ship. I have to be good enough at my job, and confident enough in my knowledge of what I do, that if shit does hit the fan and I have sent someone into a situation where something goes wrong and they will be injured or killed (while I am arm's length from it all) that I did everything I could to have prevented it. I haven't had to face that yet. I don't want to.   Sorry that went a little awry. Guess you (and Grinder) got me thinking. I think I've figured a lot of this out already. Doesn't mean I'm not worried about fucking it up every time it comes up in the future, particularly at the moment when I'm second guessing anyway."
MilitaryStories,2j2yj5,tomyrisweeps,3,Mon Oct 13 14:16:31 2014 UTC,"A unit is an abstract thing. A ship is anything but abstract. Interesting. Navies of the world literally build unit cohesion. You're all on the same raft in the middle of the ocean - fuck the raft up, everybody drowns. It's right there in front of you, can't be ignored.  We had unit cohesion. In many ways, that's all we had. We fought for each other. I suppose there have been wars where everyone fought for justice or the nation or some other higher thing, but my experience is kind of like the navy's - look right, look left, look behind, look front. There's the ship. There's your unit. That's the thing that has to survive. That's the thing that is fighting for a noble cause or whatever, that might even die for it. Okay, fine. That stuff is above our pay grade. We were the unit. You are your ship. Individual soldiers and sailors (and Marines) might have to risk death for the unit or the ship. People with rank may have to order that - for the unit, for the ship.  Same deal, except - and I never thought I'd say this - grunts have to have more imagination to mock up a unit. A ship will bark your shins, whether you believe in it or not. So there, Navy.  Anyway, it's the same commitment. Rank is the thing that makes it work, makes it possible. I once knew a soldier who would not buy in to the idea of ""unit."" He was universally despised as a coward. I'm not so sure. Gonna have to put it to a vote of the subreddit.

Not just you spinning words - it is something that I've noticed in real life. It matters too. And over time people do start talking about ships like they're some sort of living thing.

If we don't believe in units, and those guys over there do, and we get into a fight with those guys, there's gonna be some very real differences in how we behave and how they behave- differences that will have extremely real consequences in how many of us get to go home.  It's not something you can hold and touch, sure. But neither is love, or money*, or civilization, or football. Sure, you could have a go at denying the existence of any or all of those things, but I don't think you'll end up getting called a 'realist'.  *Yes, you can hold dollar bills.

Suppose there was an enemy that was really like ISIS pretends to be - each soldier dedicated to the cause rather than each other.  Each soldier willing to sacrifice his own life, his buddy's life, the lives of children, the lives of women, everybody for the cause? No unit cohesion, no ranks except mullahs (who are useless), just random jihadis on one step or another of the stairway to heaven.  I don't think ISIS troops are anything like this, but I wonder how our model would test out against troops whose loyalties were to God instead of each other? Huh. So basically we'd be killing random loonies. Not even a stand-up fight - just another bug hunt.   Okay. You're probably right.   *Yes, you can hold dollar bills. But most money doesn't exist in the form of dollar bills   Money is the biggest, most successful unreal thing ever. It began in Lydia about 1000 BCE. It is a universally shared illusion. It is hilarious because people who consider themselves ultimate realists, who participate in none of the other shared illusions, use money as the touchstone of reality. ""What's the bottom line?"" they ask.  There is no bottom line. There is no spoon either."

Too quick to fade back into the population. Quick to pounce on the unlucky. Opportunistic feeders. Bushwackers. Ran away a lot.  Was a cleaner fight with the NVA. They didn't have the equipment to give us a run for our money, but they were game. Disciplined. Soldiers. They had operations, followed orders, died in place.  They made a point of never leaving us anything. We learned to measure just how bad we'd hurt them by what they left behind:  Bamboo tripods for rockets? Ho hum.   Ammo? Had to run, didn't you? Weren't expecting arty that quick, were you?  Mortar rounds? Oh, score one for us. Base plate? Fuck man, you must've been carrying wounded.  Blood trails? Some things never change. The grunts went into hound mode. Rotating point squads on either side of the trail, move fast and silent. Probably too late to catch 'em, but you never know.  Bodies? Things slowed down. That bad, huh? Mark the spots, designate an S2 squad to search the remains, set up a perimeter. The grunts went quiet. Whispers: ""Damn man, look at that. Where's he hit? Oh. There..."" There'd be blood trails, but this was different. They had paid the price for the right to carry off their wounded, I guess. No one was hot for the trail.  They did earn that right. They were soldiers, they had a plan, they followed orders, and they walked right into a meatgrinder. They died fighting, not planting booby traps or plinking away at us between cups of tea at the local cafe. They were unlucky, and they died in a stand-up fight. Could've been us.   I feel closer to those dead men than I do to some of the Remington Raiders I see riding an old-fat-gray-guy's Harley and wearing ""Vietnam Vet"" in the gang-sign space on their leather vests. That's probably wrong of me, but that's the way it was. Nothing vaporous about the dead.   Just thinkin' out loud, OP. They shouldn't send elite troops after pissant alley thugs.

They set up a recoilless and hit one of First Platoons trucks with it, from 2-3k out.  Supposedly SF went in and took the rifle down and got a body count, too.  They'd take a hammering and stay in place until it was time for them to leave.  They weren't very good at it, and once in a while they got lucky, but they had heart.  It was kind of funny, because in trying to anticipate what they'd do (they used the same spots and we were dumb enough to get hit in the same places, so who does that point the Idiot Finger at?) we'd decide that if we were them and they were us, we'd kill at least a whole truck and crew per go-around."

Peter Sellers playing Dr Strangelove, the president and Mandrake was brilliant.   Soviet advisors, yes, they were there and shiploads of supplies from the Soviet Block. ChiCom supplies out the ass plus chinese AAA troops sent to relieve the Viet army types to go south as infantry. The north viets always played it coy by always maintaining it was a Viet Cong, the downtrodden makeshift masses, versus the US gangster invader army. A crock of shit, by late 67 it was chiefly an NVA vs US war and those NVA were very well supplied and highly trained. By then the VC too were sporting newly issued gear, particularly the AK-47 and state of the game RPGs. They are still at it too, if you go there these days you'll be shown all the handmade ordinance, booby traps, mines, homemade guns, the whole nine yards.

So this is like 1966 or 67? Where I was in Colorado Springs we felt temblors from these kinds of things. The COC in Cheyenne Mountain would suddenly become inaccessible - no traffic in or out. The Chidlaw Building would go black - blinds down, gates closed, guys with machine guns patrolling the perimeter - right in the middle of downtown.  Dad's would leave home, Mom's would look worried, maybe cry a little bit, all us kids knew something was up. The townies went about their business, oblivious. Just as well.

I imagine 100 megatons would really tend to fuck your day up. I often wonder how we survived that era. Those megatons wouldn't have came from the inscrutable east though, they were still in the process of perfecting their ICBMs back then (think Korea today). But that's another story.  I remember when dad was stationed in Germany and the family also there. There would come an alert, he would get up in the middle of the night and put on all his battle rattle, mom up too and making coffee. By the time I actually got out of bed he was gone and it was she and I bringing out our evacuation bags and placing them next to the front door and awaiting word on if this one was the real thing. Of course it never was and thank the saints for that. I doubt our chances of making it Vilseck to Bremerhaven were very good anyway.

The same scenario has played out with a couple of other known ChiCom AAA units who are also on the move generally south. All of these units are passing an unusually high volume of live traffic, communicating directly with their main HQ, their High Command in Beijing. Are they going on maneuvers, why have they been issued new radio equipment and what is going on in the south of China, anything happening in Hong Kong? Lots of questions are being raised, analysts are working overtime on the problem.   One of the Low Life Traffic Analysts had a bingo moment and figured out how the 5th, and now other AAA units, were traveling ‚Äì they were on the main north/south chinese railway. Their transmissions were coming from a moving train. Made sense, but by now the 5th AAA Regiment were way the hell past the Hong Kong spur and still heading southwest and maintaining their commo as they went.   Then they rolled right into North Vietnam! At least we had a pretty good idea they did, their communications abruptly stopped very close to the border. What now, was VN about to be invaded, again. Not this time, but this is the story of how I learned that Chinese AAA units were deployed in North Vietnam during the US war. These units did regular one-year tours of duty. It was Mao's boys shooting the SAMs and manning most of the anti-aircraft artillery despite those pictures of Jane Fonda slobbering all over Vietnamese AA gunners. The ChiCom's manned the guns around Hanoi and Haiphong harbor. Chinese regular army soldiers died when our Wild Weasel's blasted those AA defenses. I wonder what their families were told when the bodies came home.   period propaganda poster  Translation: 700 million Chinese people are the strong backup force for the Vietnamese people and China's vast land is Vietnam's reliable rear base - Mao Ze-dong, 1966.

MilitaryStories,2iowj9,doksteve,4,Wed Oct 8 19:58:50 2014 UTC,"How did you find the other end of a radio conversation? Considering they used different frequencies for each station and different callsigns on each freq, it looks like a frustrating mess to figure out - especially if they kept changing it. Did you rely on a list of commonly used enemy freqs? Thanks again."
MilitaryStories,2iowj9,full_of_stars,7,Thu Oct 9 00:35:06 2014 UTC,"I have probably overstated the amount of frequency changing that went on generally, but some target networks did it pretty frequently and pretty much as I have described. So my example was of a network that was at one end of the spectrum with that changing freq stuff.   Finding the other end is relatively easy if you've worked the job for a while. Generally you copy your target, the one side of the conversation, and when that guy stops sending you use your other receiver to slowly tune through the bands searching for another Morse signal, perhaps one that you can ID just from the sound and the ops sending technique as being from the network you usually copy. You pause on that signal and wait for him to stop. If, when he stops, your original target begins sending, and its in reply to what you heard the newly found guy send - you got your man and now have both sides of the Morse transmissions.   It sometimes happened that you were not able to locate the other end, it sometimes happened that you got into the conversation way late and it ended soon after you found the other end. So it went, at least of you did find the other end you had recovered that part of the network (that info would go on the boards for that network), and, in the case I wrote of, I now knew where to find Control and one of the outstations. The other outstations would be close to where you found that one when the net came back up again so knowing the general frequency of that one outstation gave you a baseline to search for the others during the next Sked.  We did know the frequency ranges they operated within, we also kept notes on those boards I mentioned.   Make sense?   I should add to that we always searched for the other end of any signal we copied, so to a Hawg looking for the other end was a well practiced technique."

Your Hummer and  that radio sound a lot like the equipment I was issued. The Jeep had a universal joint that made the most awful noise all the time, becoming louder and louder until it broke which happened several times in the year I drove it. Usually breaking down someplace you didn't want to linger at. The radio too was cranky, had PMS at times so would act all 'fuck you' and just go silent. The general fix was to take it off its mounts and lift it six inches, no more, no less, and drop it. Something in there would snap out of it and voila, most of the time she began working for a while longer."

MilitaryStories,2iitvc,Dittybopper,5,Wed Oct 8 11:23:37 2014 UTC,"Hollywood's got nuthin' on the US military.  I remember the first night I was sitting on the perimeter sandbags at Quang Tri after dark. Pop flares going up randomly around the perimeter drifting to ground on their little parachutes. Every once in a while the quad fifties or 40mm dusters would open up in a ""recon by fire"" of something suspicious in the treeline, streams of loud fire sending ricochets arcing up over the treelines. Random arty illum missions being fired in any direction, drifting lights in the dark underlighting the low clouds.   Then in the distance, a garden hose stream of red tracers from a dark point in the sky, followed ten seconds later by a buzz saw noise - Spooky, a C47 with a gatling gun spraying an infiltration route up at the DMZ. Then, off to the left, out toward Khe Sanh, illuminating the western horizon of jungle hills - FLASH! Flash-fla-flash! Fashity-flash, flash, flash! About halfway through the trail flashes, the ground began to shake. Twenty seconds later distant booms and bangs in perfect rondo sequence with the flashes, like a second singer of ""Row, row, row your boat,"" a bass singer chiming in after the soprano of lights.  Somebody said, ""Arclight."" What poet was in charge of naming three B52s dropping 1000-pound bombs over a box a half click by three clicks? I was sitting there shirtless and hot, trying to take it all in. Not in Kansas any more.  Years later, I was in a dark theater showing Apocalypse Now, watching the scene where they get so far upriver they've drifted out of reality. The transition is symbolized by a bridge, illuminated by lightbulbs, tracers and random explosions. And I'm thinking No man. It was better than that. Is that all the weirdness you could sell to your producers? Man, it was WAY weirder than that.  Lightning and thunder, signs and omens in the sky. You set my mind adrift again OP. Who's going to do this morning's work? I'm blaming you.   We had to chaperone our hated Chaplain around a few times. He was a fire-and-brimstone Southern Baptist, and a Mason. We played the most offensive rap possible.    Good for you. Our chaplain was also fire-and-brimstone Baptist. He was mightily amused at my dogtags which identified me as ""Agnostic"" - I think the dogtag clerk thought that was a religion. He spent time in the field with me coaching him on my altar boy Latin so he could do Extreme Unction on any Catholic boy who needed it. He had begged some holy water from the Catholic Chaplain on the theory that even if administered by a Protestant, couldn't hurt, might help. Dude could also do a passable ""Shema Yisrael"" if needed.  He was everybody's chaplain. Seems like things changed for the worse in the last 40 years or so."

I can't even begin to imagine the terror that our enemies faced when our air assets showed up, when we got them.  Like a kid smashing bugs with his finger.   Hey!  I ain't no bug!

As long as you're story-bombing your own thread, OP, I figure we're far enough down the threadline that one more won't hurt.  This is a repeat of something I wrote over in /r/Military in response to I don't know what:   I was on the estuaries eastsoutheast of Hue in I Corps on a dark night. We were an ARVN training battalion, night-positioned on the estuary shoreline. Upstream ambush position reported two big objects floating downstream along the estuary shore, no lights, no engine. Had to be US Navy hovercraft. Heard they had been working the inlets and estuaries. The things were bristling with machine guns, at least two .50 cals, some kind of single-barreled 40mm duster, a goddamned cannon of some kind and maybe worse things.  The night ambush laid low. The MACV people were frantically radioing MACV HQ at Hue to contact these guys. Who were they? Navy or Marines? WTF were they doing here? Did they know we were here?  The rest of the training battalion was improvising an exercise in Cap Trooper training: Drop! Freeze! Shut the fuck up! We didn't want to set these guys off.  The senior MACV guy, an Army captain, finally gave up on getting into commo with the hovercraft. They were drifting close, and evidently getting someone to do something at MACV Hue in the middle of the night required a lot of shouting.  The MACV captain dropped all his web gear and his helmet. He stomped down to the shoreline and stood there with his hands in the air and a flashlight pointing down at himself. I could just see the shadow of the hovercraft drifting slowly toward our position. Suddenly everyone was blinded by a spotlight on our Captain. Long silence. We could hear metallic noises coming from the hovercraft, see gunners moving.  ""You on the shore! Identify yourself!"" No mike. Just some guy yelling.  ""MACV! You have friendlies on this shore for 200 meters in both directions! ARVNs!""  The light went out. ""Your people know not to shoot at us?""  Long pause. Some restraint on the MACV Captain's part. ""Yeah. They know not to do that.""  ""Roger that! Thanks for telling us. Have a good night!""  Then, like water-balrogs, they silently glided by in the cloudy night, each lethal extrusion silhouetted in low light. If they had lit us up, it would've been a massacre. I never did like that MACV captain much, but that was balls-out. I'm not sure I could've turned that flashlight on.  Should be a medal for stuff like that."

These Hawg Notes are the most interesting damned thing I've read.  For me it's a little peek into a weird world that I never knew.  At times we had 'Intel', but where it came from only God knows.  There were times it came from actual informants, and was good, but the rest of the time...I've always been a sucker for the sneaky stuff.  Spy movies and intrigue.    The fact that you got to do the locked-away-in-a-box work, and then actually got to go out in the field and apply those same skills for immediate (in Army Time) results, is pretty damned cool.

Those got reported to our version of the CID posthaste.  Perhaps I didn't explain things well as far as the ChiCom ops using English. Lets put it in context; Like airline pilots or ocean going vessels today where English is the international language common to all the world over these ChiCom ops didn't have to be fluent english speakers. Like pilots they had to be familiar with a set number of phrases, say ""altitude, change heading to, your course is, etc."" None of them are expected to be able to read aloud Gone With the Wind with perfect inflection but simply have a working knowledge within the context of their jobs. Those Morse ops could get by with a working vocabulary of maybe 50 or 100 words. Remember, they were employing ""International Morse code"" as their base radio procedures for the reasons I stated. I am quite sure their training involved learning the little english they would need plus knowing what the Q and Z sigs meant. A good idea would be to think of Morse code as a language. In fact, those US military Intel ops working today are paid a bonus for knowing the Morse ""language"" and maintaining their proficiency. Thier job today is nothing like the one we performed however, but I won't go into that."
MilitaryStories,2ihf2e,Dittybopper,8,Mon Oct 6 20:29:27 2014 UTC,"We copied radio networks of various types and multiple stations, very few point-to-point radio transmissions. A radio network consists of the Control station and his outstations, there could be as few as two or as many as 12 outstations, plus the communications procedures employed by those networks often varied. You had to know what type of network you were dealing with. One of the most complicated type of network was a so-called Star Network where all the stations communicated to one another instead of all simply communicating with Control. Control would still be the Big Cheese and pass his traffic (messages) first but then the outstations would begin passing traffic between one another. Brother that made for wild times attempting to record everything that passed between every station on the network. In a situation like that the Room Sup would take on some of the stations and assign other ops to help with the others while you maintained continuity on Control and whomever he was dittybopping to. For the most part however you only had Control and a few outstations to deal with. You were tasked with copying everything said by all involved.  Five minutes before your target network would be up you were sitting at your position, headsets on, radios tuned, antennas tuned, paper properly threaded into the MILL (an all Caps typewriter with some special characters), you would then dial up and down bracketing the expected intercept frequency searching for the Control to do his tune up routine, and on the left receiver doing the same in hopes of catching an Outstation doing the same. They often did this, some more elaborately than others, a matter of individual personality of the radio op. Some might not do it at all, which was proper operating procedure since they were also in the business of not being intercepted. They knew we were out here 300 miles off their mainland and they did things to throw us, to keep us guessing and off their tracks. Useless things, we knew all their tricks. In any case some ChiCom ops would hold their telegraph key down while going through their tuneup routine, other would tap it repeatedly, some just sat there silent. They were punctual though, had to hand them that. The moment the second hand on our clocks hit the mark at whatever time they were supposed to hit the airwaves you could count on them doing so. Most usually it went like this; Net Control called first, did a call up routine, it might be repeated twice or more, usually not. An outstation would answer, or if  there were several outstations on the network they would answer in turn. Control would announce if he had messages to transmit then query his outstations if they had any. If Control had traffic he would then go right into it; if not he would clear the outstation(s) one-by-one to send theirs. After traffic was passed came a collation session wherein one side of the conversation or the other would ask for clarification on anything they might have missed or were confused about. Then it was goodbye til we meet again. Between all of that they could get up to some shenanigans too, doing stuff to throw your kindly Morse Intercept op off his game. Them doing that just made the game more interesting, damned near fun.   FINI  Next: Meeting a SKED"

What is a ""duck""?   What was your job training like before you deployed?  Do you have any personal experience where an intercepted message translated directly to an offensive that you saw or participated in?

Then too all this rabid quoting caused the targets to be on the air far longer than was usual. This was an opportunity, an opportunity to fine tune their radio locations via HFDF, High Frequency Direction Finding, time too for the Special ID ops to dial in their radio radio transmitter fingerprinting, getting the very best copy of its individual signature as it were. And for we intercept ops to learn more about the personalities of the ChiCom operators, who was measured and steady in their work, who became flustered and harebrained when the pressure was on.

They would come into the Morse bays and start in on some mundane subject while one was trying to catch a Sked, or show up with an old Sked wanting to expound on their theory of how you couldn't possibly have heard correctly this or that and attempting to rearrange the dits and dahs to fit their idea of what was really transmitted. Bothersome bunch who only half understood our job.   How was it to sit shift after shift and copy Morse? Pretty much how I believe it went with you linguists I imagine because to us the Morse was a language. After you've worked the job a while you don't hear individual dits and dahs, it is more like someone speaking a language which happens to be composed of Morse code. So, I hear   BT BT QRM QRN QRF 10 K in Morse.  To me the guy just said...  ""break break, I'm experiencing man made and natural interference, change frequency 10 OVER.""

If they weren't so stupid they'd know that decks clean themselves, but at least it keeps them from causing troubles and gainfully employed.  Mutinies are a result of low morale and idle, drunken Seamen.  If you aren't tough on them, hell follows.

How Copy?‚Äù  ‚ÄúShadow Wun-four, solid copy one all.  Permission granted‚Äù the voice on the other side replied to Cpl Ian.  With that Cpl. Ian repeated the pack count to the gate guard and the guard repeated the numbers to the D.C.‚Äôs command tent.   After the proper departing SOPs were commenced, Sgt. Andy took his team with Cpl Andiwol, LCpl.s Tom and John with four AUP in a ‚Äòzig-zag‚Äô formation down the road towards the bazaar, where they would cut up Donkeys at the main intersection.  After a few minutes, and they gained some distance, our team stepped off in a staggered column.  Instead of going to the bazaar, we cut north at the end of the D.C.‚Äôs perimeter wall.  The ammo in the dump pouch was definitely noticeable as it tugged on my belt with every step.  The M240 was cradled in my arms with my hands brought up to my chest, in an effort to carry the weight of the war machine.  ‚ÄòThis is going to suck walking through these fields and jumping over the irrigation ditches,‚Äô I thought to myself I fidgeted with the M240, attempting to redistribute its mass.  It had only been a few minutes and I already felt the weight of all of this gear.  The afternoon heat was oppressive, even though it is a relatively cool 110¬∞F.  My blouse was now completely soaked from sweat after only a few hundred meters, and we had a long way to go until we reached the objective.  We were 200 meters west of Donkeys and had no visual of the other team.  However we kept in constant contact through our black gear Motorolas.  The other team was now traveling north along Donkeys and we were shadowing their movement through a long series of fields and habitual tree lines.   The M240 was getting really heavy now and no amount of shuffling the cradle carry helped.  Thinking of Vietnam pictures of M60 gunners, I lifted the machinegun in a military press over my head and rested it on my shoulders.  Even with the bullets and hard edges of the gun dug into my neck, this was more manageable. With one hand one the front sight and the other one the butt-stock, I hopped over a two foot wide wadi into another long field.  These wadis were everywhere and enabled the farmers to irrigate their fields.  The fields and roads were set up in a grid pattern, not unlike any large city in America.  Not surprising since the United States built Marjah in the 1950s.  This field sucked though.  It was recently flooded plowed and the soil was soft and loose.  I could see the water vapor rising from the earth, turning the field into a sauna.  Each step became a slight struggle, battling with my weight and the loose footing, to stay upright.  I started to lose some distance with the rest of the team and I tried to pick up the pace.  Without any warning the M240 dropped from my shoulders.  What the fuck, I had a good grip on it.  I turned around to pick up the and saw it laying in the damp soil, in two pieces.  The barrel release must have hit my shoulder or something.  I grabbed for the barrel and I could descry that the chamber was completely filled dirt.  Fuck, fuck, fuckitty-fuck-fuck, fuck.  I dropped to my knees and started to dig the mud out the chamber with my fingers.  Glancing up saw the team is still moving forward.  I didn‚Äôt have a black gear to tell them what happened, so I worked faster to get the weapon up and ready.  My anxiety was through the roof now.  I needed must get this gun up and get back into patrol.  This would have been a bad time to get in a TIC. I bashed the barrel onto the receiver to dislodge the debris and gave it a hardy blow to clean it out.  Looked good enough to me.  I reattached the barrel and managed to get my two clicks.  Cpl. Ian saw me struggling with the gun and halted the team until I can caught up.    ‚ÄúJeff, you alright?‚Äù Cpl. Ian asked as I made it up to his position  Flustered, I replied, ‚ÄúThe fucking barrel fell off and got filled with mud.  I think it work, it should still shoot‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù I nodded my reply and kept walking forward.  ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go up near the front with Shane. I‚Äôll put Greg in the rear‚Äù  With the M240 again in the exhausting cradle carry, I made my way up to the third spot in patrol behind Shane and one of the AUP.    After a hell of a hump north we started getting closer to the Objective area.  I didn‚Äôt remember it being nearly this far a couple of days ago.  We must have gone ten clicks by now.  But I also was not carrying this much shit then either.  I tried to stick close to Shane since I couldn‚Äôt exactly engage a threat with any haste.  We crossed yet another tree line and yet another compound.  We were about one-hundred meters from Donkeys and maybe two-hundred meters from the other team, but could not see either, due to the thick vegetation and myriad of compounds and walls.  The other team said they just pasted a two story building that would be good for us to set up an overwatch position.  I saw it just to our North-East about one-hundred meters, since there were very few building in Marjah that have a second floor.  Shane and I were the only ones that have crossed the last tree line and the rest of the team progressed from the south.  Walking up to Shane with the M240 across my shoulders, I saw he was standing there smiling at me.  I also spotted a dog standing him off and barking about 30 feet from the two of us.  It looked something like a Bull Terrier/Afghan Mutt.  Not a very big dog, but meaty.  ‚ÄúHey Jeff, watch this‚Äù  Before I could say anything, Shane readied his M4 at the beast.  I turned my attention back to the dog.  Crack.  The dog flinched and fell to its side, whimpering and kicking its back leg.  A stream of blood squirted from its side, once, twice, third time it slowed.  The white fur quickly turned vibrant red.   What the fuck?  Why did he shoot that dog?  I made up my mind to put a 9mm in its head to put it out of its misery if it kept kicking. But the whimpering was gone now, after only a few seconds and then the kicking slowly came to a stop.   ‚ÄúWhy did you shoot it?‚Äù    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.  Just wanted to.‚Äù He chuckled. ‚ÄúIt was cool though.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a retard, you know that right?‚Äù  Just then Cpl. Ian and the AUP came running through the tree line to see what happened. ‚ÄúWhat was that, what going on?‚Äù Ian asked.  ‚ÄúHe shot a dog‚Äù I answered.  Ian looked at the dying dog then at Shane who was giggling like a school bully who just pushed the special education student down a flight of stairs.  ‚ÄúWhy did you shoot the dog?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wanted to‚Äù  Cpl Ian and his conservative, Christian, homeschooled upbringing obviously disapproved when he sighed and shook his head.  He also knew there was no point in asking any more questions since Shane‚Äôs smile said it all.  Greg came next jumping over the wadi and running through the trees with his M4 in the alert carry.  ‚ÄúWhat was that? Did you see something? Where are they?‚Äù Greg asked in a half panic as if ready for a fight.  ‚ÄúOh‚Äù Greg let out as he saw the upside down dog and Shane with his shit eating grin.  Over the black gear came Sgt. Andy inquiring about the shot and Cpl Ian informed them that it was a dog and left it at that.  We still had a job to do."
MilitaryStories,2hpkzt,TrimHer,6,Sun Sep 28 17:27:53 2014 UTC,"V  Greg and two police officers cut the pie as they rounded the front of the two story house and vanished from sight. Shane pushed a police officer into a doorway on the ground floor as Ian and I passed an already cleared room and window and climb up the exterior, spiral stair case to the second floor balcony.  The second floor was L-shaped with a small room directly in front of the stairwell and a longer room along the balcony.  Cpl. Ian was first up the stairs so he went to clear the direct threat, the small room.  I turned right. The three foot wide balcony had one large room with an open door and two windows on one side.  The other side of the walkway is embedded with vertical and diagonally crossed branches.  Set up in an almost elegant and harmonious balustrade.  This was a pretty nice house for being made from cow shit, grass and mud.  Not as nice as the concrete houses, even though I have only seen two of those.  One of which the Marines commandeered on Apes before they were overrun by the enemy and pulled back to the Porkchop.  The other was the police CP north of the Porkchop.  That place was nice and cool during patrol breaks and had a beautiful flower garden in the Spring.  Holding the M240 like Rambo, safety on and bolt locked to the rear, I positioned the business end towards the closest window.  Pieing window and tracking the muzzle with my eyes I searched for any threat before I entered.  With my kill finger on the safety, finish clearing the room.  Nothing but dirt, not even a rug.  Whoever lived here had enough sense to pack up leave before we brought the war to their literal doorstep.  ‚ÄúClear!‚Äù I shouted.  ‚ÄúClear!‚Äù Ian relayed to the rest on the ground and they replied the same for their locations.  Cpl Greg stayed on the ground level with the police officers and set security for us.  In the open area between the small room and large room on the second floor, was an opening with a makeshift ladder that provided access to the roof of the large room, closest to the Donkeys.  Shane was the first one up.  I handed him the M240 and he placed it behind him, then he grabbed my shoulder strap to help me on my climb up the improvised ladder.  Once I reached the brink of the roof, I threw one leg over the edge and rolled, as I weighed too much for a more graceful approach.  I reciprocated the aid by helping Cpl. Ian gain access to the perch.  Once the three of us were safely on the roof, I settled in behind the M240 at the North-East corner.  Donkeys lay only fifteen meters to my left and I could see several hundred meters down the road, until the vegetation hindered my view.  I was relieved to finally be in overwatch as it meant I didn‚Äôt have to hump the gun for a while.  The respite was welcomed and long overdue in my opinion.   It was time to set up shop, as we could be here for a while.  Unwrapping the belt from the receiver, I gave the M240 a once over to ensure its condition one.  I removed the two-hundred round belt from the dump pouch and placed it to my left.  I arranged the ammunition in a manner that would allow me to load it quickly.  Scanning the sector of fire, from 0¬∞ to 75¬∞, I tried to determine the enemy‚Äôs most likely avenue of approach.  Sgt. Andy‚Äôs team was supposedly about one hundred meters directly North on this side of Donkeys. I couldn‚Äôt see shit due North because of the tall trees just in front of me. But I had a nice view of the east side of Donkeys for about three hundred meters, to the next tree line.   I could make out that the tree line had either a wadi or walking path following it, which was typical.  The tree line went less than two-hundred meters east from the road until it reached a large compound wall.  In the mid-section of the tree line was a fifty meter open gap without trees.  That gap will be my most likely avenue of approach and I will orient my weapon system there.  I glanced back and saw Shane just took a picture of me.  I guess I did look pretty badass up here.  Shane proned out to my right and extended his grip-pod to rest his M4 down.    ‚ÄúYou see that opening in the tree line over there?‚Äù  I asked.  ‚ÄúThat one?‚Äù Shane said as he pointed, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what?  About three-hundred meters right?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYeah, at least three hundred‚Äù Shane peered through his ACOG.  ‚ÄúLess than four hundred for sure.‚Äù  With that I set the rear sight aperture to three-hundred meters and practiced sighting in.  I could hear Cpl. Ian relaying to Sgt. Andy that we were set up on the roof and the acknowledgement.  After a short while, perhaps five or ten minutes, we received more traffic from Sgt. Andy.  Apparently they could not see much of anything due to the flora, so they were going to move up to the next tree line.  Shane and I peered over our weapons looking for movement as the other team advanced.  Once they reached the next tree line, Sgt. Andy said they still didn‚Äôt have a good view and that they were going to the next tree line.  I continued to scan area, even though I could not see other team I knew they area about two hundred fifty to three hundred meters due north of me.   ‚ÄúIan this Andy, we are going to go around a compound by the road to see if we can get to a good place to set up.‚Äù  ‚ÄúRodger that‚Äù  A few minutes went by and Sgt. Andy sent another SitRep.  ‚ÄúHey guys, uh, there‚Äôs some shady looking guy in a brown man-dress on the other side of the road.  Our police want to question him.‚Äù  Less than sixty seconds later, an explosion rings out from their location.  It was a fast sounding explosion, unlike HME and more like C4 or composition B.  Looking at where I assumed their position to be, I saw no dirt plume.  That couldn‚Äôt have been an IED, maybe RPG?  Before I had time to think about, seconds after the explosion, fully automatic fire erupted towards their position.  The amount of fire that can only come from multiple belt fed machineguns.  The three of us on the roof started yelling the typical outcries that follow contact as Shane and I scrambled to gain sight pictures and put our guns on kill mode while Cpl. Ian got on the horn to C.O.C. to advise we are now in TIC.  And then I saw him.  He was exactly where I anticipated him.  A man, a fat man, in a brown man-dress was running at a sprint to the east along the tree line.  Was something in his arms, looked like it. But I couldn‚Äôt be sure. He was moving fast and I only had a few seconds until I would lose him behind the compound wall.  I placed my front sight post so that the left edge was just slightly touching his front profile as he ran.   ‚ÄúIan! I see someone!‚Äù  I screamed as loud as I could while tracking the MAM.  ‚ÄúWell shoot him!‚Äù  Without hesitating, I fully depressed the trigger, sending the home the bolt.  My sight picture turned into flame and smoke as I continued to traverse the front sight post as if I could still see the target.  With adrenaline pumping through my body, the twelve to fifteen round burst felt like a one hundred round burst.  I could hear Shane‚Äôs M4 cracking away at the same target during my burst.  Fully releasing the trigger I attempted to regain a sight picture of the target.  I could get one more good burst in before he reached the wall.  When the muzzle flash disappeared I expected to see the man on my front sight post since I know I traversed it properly.  He wasn‚Äôt there. I scanned the area again.  He was gone.  There‚Äôs no way he made it to the wall that fast.  Then it hit me.  I killed him.   ‚ÄúDid we get him?  I think I killed him‚Äù I asked Shane.  I looked over at Shane and he looked right at me.  ‚ÄúFuck yeah, fuck yeah! We got him!‚Äù Shane raised his hand for a high five while wearing a huge smile.  I couldn‚Äôt help but to smile too. ‚ÄúI fucking wasted that gook!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI know I got at least one hit on him. I saw him drop.  Ian we got that fucker!‚Äù Shane proclaimed.  ‚ÄúWhere was he at?‚Äù Ian asked the gleeful duo.  ‚ÄúRight fucking there in that tree line‚Äù I pointed.    ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù  I let off several more burst at the same location to mark the location.  Ian and Shane fired several rounds each into the tree line, as the other team was still taking fire.  I kept scanning for other targets, anything that moved.  I fired a few more bursts into the trees, towards where the gunfire came from.  Until Sgt. Andy‚Äôs voice came over the radio.  He sounded confused and disoriented. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I am, I‚Äôm, I‚Äôm in the wadi. My ankle hurts. We have a Marine down. We need you here.  Just get here fast.‚Äù   It was later determined that the man they wanted to question was the same man Shane and I ended.  He was standing on the opposite side of the road from the team.  Sgt Andy said the Police officers started yelling at the man (over the next days from our police partners and the EOD and Intel sweep of the battle sight, we found out the man did have a Kalashnikov strapped to his back and he was in the process of planning an IED).  The man raised his hands over his head.  Sgt. Andy said then he started to smile and lowered his hands.   Immediately after he lowered his hands the explosion happened (initially most thought it was an IED, but EOD found no evidence and a police officer with the team said he saw the RPG.)"

MilitaryStories,2hhvcl,goots,17,Fri Sep 26 03:28:39 2014 UTC,"Whenever I see him now, I think to myself that if there was some way I could just give him my legs, so we can share, or maybe I could give him one leg and I get the other, maybe it would make things right -- make things a little happier for the both of us. I got out OK and he lost his legs, and that's such a shit deal.   It is a shit deal.  He can't stand up or walk or run anymore.  But I'd be willing to bet you cash money that he's more sick and tired of people reacting to him not having them than he is.     But at least I could have done something, anything, instead of being a part of the passive audience.   You were doing something.  The dominoes fall where they fall.  At least he's not a grave marker, right?  We had a discussion at my VetCenter, and it was about Survivor's Guilt.  Our counselor, an OIF Vet, was talking about how people feel responsible for things outside of their control, and it started to dawn on me.  We get indoctrinated, from the start, to be responsible for things outside of our control.  What's the first lesson in Basic or Boot Camp?  You are your brother's keeper.  Homeboy does something stupid, or is all fuckered up at first formation, and it isn't his fault.  It's yours.  All of you.  Anyone who knows him.  You let him down, by him being a soup sandwich.  Right?  That works in the military, but it also leads to a lot of second guessing and self doubt and in the long run, guilt that's of no fault.  How many times have you been hemmed up for something some dumb-ass did that you had absolutely no control over?  I'm talking minor, stupid infractions.  But we all got held to the accountability of it, yeah?  Now carry that over to shit like your boys actually getting fucked up.  That feeling of accountability, responsibility, for being there or especially not being there when something bad happens.  Not being able to change the outcome of awful circumstances, is at the forefront of the issue.  Maybe a perspective to chew on."

It was just a turning point when this came up and the discussion about guilt or I Should Have Been There made this leap as to why we feel that way.  If it was anybobdy else telling you the same thing, you'd say ""Dude!  There wasn't anything you could do.""  But when it's you, it seems people really feel that guilt, even though they had no control over the situation.  I know I had one incident where I was supposed to be leading that patrol, and I was TC'ing a truck because I thought I'd broken my ankle.  One of the guys  got shot in a far ambush, and I had to listen to the whole thing on the radio.  I helped load him up on the MEDEVAC.  He was okay.  He was really fuckin' lucky, but it still bothered the shit out of me for five years.  This incident was one of the things we were talking about.  Funny enough, another guy in the group, also an engineer and same situation, swap gunner for patrol, same outcome.  When we got into the 'why' of feeling guilty about it, my above comment is what came out of the group.  Since then I haven't thought about that incident in the same way.  Sorry for the drawn out response, but I thought I'd clarify why I said what  I said.  If it's like a broken rib, or just a little pebble in your boot, I don't know.

The sides usually number eleven each, there being five forwards, two left-wings, two right-wings and two goal-keepers. The goals consist of two upright posts 18¬†ft (5.5 m) high and 20¬†ft (6.1 m) apart with a crossbar 7¬†feet from the ground. The game lasts for two periods with an intermission. Pushing the ball under the bar counts 5 points; lifting or throwing it over the bar counts 8. A touchdown behind goal for safety counts 2 to the attacking side.

The RCP (Route Clearance Package) we replaced in Afghanistan had a problem with helo's coming in low over their quarters.  One of the Platoon Sergeants or Squad Leaders told me about it while we were swapping out.  Our barracks were in the flight path from Sharana.  Now, they could easily hook south and come in over HESCO barriers and wire and a bunch of nothing, but they chose to come in on the most direct route.  Mostly it was CH-47's, lots of rotor wash, and according to him they'd come in really low.  This blew barracks doors open or right off the hinges, and knocked the port-a-shitters over once or twice.  He said that they hadn't had any problems in, well, since he'd hit the switch, and he was explaining to me about how to tell helo's to fuck right off if they started doing it again.  They'd been getting warmed up to roll out, he was sitting in the TC seat, and in came one bird.  They don't travel alone.  All of our gun-trucks were equipped with ECM's, both passive and active.  We always left them off, most of the time, until we were far enough outside of the wire to not interfere with general FOB goings on.  Well, before you roll you've got to have all of your systems warmed up , so his ECM was on, but not in operation.  When he saw the first bird come over, blowing down their shit, he waited.  He said as the second one came over he flipped it on, or had one of his crewmembers do it.  He said the bird banked hard, probably all of its detection systems going bonkers all of a sudden, started shitting flares everywhere and powered away for another landing pass.  He said they didn't come in low over the area anymore."

It was always funny watching the LN's look at their phones like they were missing something the couple of times we were in populated areas, and we were passing through.  One night, we were staying over in a potentially bad spot, and I think it was Air Force, was doing an ECM burn over our area.

MilitaryStories,2hag6h,squidbrat,20,Wed Sep 24 02:03:43 2014 UTC,"When I was a very junior officer, who had to salute pretty much every other officer that I saw, I always took great joy in saluting officers with stuff in their hands. Car keys in particular - they would always flick up and hit them in the forehead.   Jeez, looking back on that I've been a cynical little shit since I started out in this job."

Still think it's funny when very junior officers don't know the ranks from other services and end up panic saluting enlisted guys."

The problem is that there are many other unwritten rules for saluting - for example, don't salute someone who is having a chat with their hat off, or if they are on the phone. But these rules all get bent and there's too many grey areas."
MilitaryStories,2hag6h,snimrass,6,Thu Sep 25 02:35:06 2014 UTC,"Apparently regulations on saluting differ from country to country.  In the Finnish army the officer can just choose to ignore a salute (the lower ranking soldier has to keep saluting until they pass by, if not saluted back.)  You are also not required to salute if your hands are occupied (carrying something, riding a bike, driving...), in which case a simple nod will do.  I had to walk around with crutches for a month after breaking a knee and it was pretty great not having to actively salute anyone."

We were an advance team for an Army artillery battalion, mostly officers and senior NCOs.   Evening comes, and someone says there's an Officers' Club. Seven or so 2LTs and one West Point 1LT start off for the O-Club. We're heading west, so the sun is setting behind the kind of hooch-shack-tent hybrid designated for officer drinking.  Out of the Club comes a barrel-shaped guy. We can see his gray hair highlighted by the sunset under his absolutely perfectly placed Marine headgear. The guy looked fit, if a little heavy, and old. I dunno how he looked old. He kinda walked old. Anyway, backlit by the sunset, he looked like he ate twenty-something LTs for breakfast. He was striding/walking/marching/conquering in our direction.  We all straightened up. Do we salute? It's a big base, but still, it's in a combat zone. What are the rules? We all looked at the West Point guy. He was gonna salute - we could tell. So say we all.  This guy has got to be wreathed in stars. He's coming closer. Might be the Marine Commandant!  I we were marching now, route step, all eyes on the West Pointers right hand. Before he could move, the approaching Field Marshal of the World whipped a salute on our 1st LT. ""Good evening, Sir."" He said.  Whaaaat? We all slowed as he walked past, tiny Marine butterbars on his collar. He looked resigned and sad.  How was that even possible? I didn't find out until later.  Fuckin' Marines. When they need an officer, they promote the closest guy - even if he's old, even if he doesn't want it, even if he's an E7. Then he has to go drink in the O-Club with the child-officers. No wonder he was sad."

Nothing more glorious than a total breakdown of military bearing, than when it happens during the most inopportune events.  Reminds me of one of my buddies, at our Battalion ball, who didn't drink.  We got him drunk that night, to the point that he was stealing carafes of table wine from other tables and drinking straight from them.  He walked up to our Sergeant Major, absolutely twisted, and said, ""Gobble Gobble Sarn't Major!"", before we could drag him away.  The running joke in our Platoon, if not the Battalion, was that the SMAJ's voluminous double-chin was reminiscent of a Tom turkey.

I still hold that office - from time to time General Officers must suffer the consequences of the truth pour encourager les autres, as was famously said. The pity is that we are not encouraging them hard enough. They need to get it right.  Pour encourager les autres was, in fact, said by Voltaire in a commentary on the English habit of executing unsuccessful Admirals. A series of Admirals were executing for deviating from the general orders of the Admiralty. One, however, was executed for rigidly adhering to the Admiralty's general orders, but losing anyway. They also executed him, to drive home the point that the Admiralty required obedience, but not as much as it required victory.  Quote:   Dans ce pays-ci, il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour encourager les autres. [In this country [England] it is good to kill, from time to time, an admiral in order to encourage the others.]   Voltaire (Fran√ßois-Marie Arouet, 1694 ‚Äì 1778) _Candide_, ou l'Optimisme, c. 1758, Ch. 23    The Battle of Minorca (20 May 1756) was  the opening sea battle of the Seven Years' War. Minorca had come under British control during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1708. The French had overrun the island except for a small garrison. Admiral John Byng's mission was to drive off the French fleet and relieve the garrison. Byng engaged 12 French ships with an equal fleet exercising considerable caution and an over-reliance on observing the ""rules of engagement"" of the Admiralty. The fight was a draw, but Byng and his senior officers determined that there was no chance of relieving the garrison, and withdrew to Gibraltar. The Admiralty charged Byng for breaching the Articles of War by failing to do all he could to fulfill his orders and support the garrison by, ironically, too scrupulously obeying the standing orders of the Admiralty. Byng was court-martialled, found guilty and shot on March 14, 1757."

No go, rangers was all he could see. Now that is fine if it is what he really wanted, so I shut up.

MilitaryStories,2giueb,djabelek,2,Wed Sep 17 15:48:28 2014 UTC,"Special Operations.  Thank the Call of Duty video games.  I think the Army, and the military in general, has gotten what they wanted.  Regular Army hates, absolutely hates, SF.  At least they did ten years ago.  Same story as back when you were in South East Asia, from what I've read.  Same story with the Rangers and OSS back in WWII.  In Afghanistan, 2009, Regular Army guys were doing the advisory/training missions, and so were some high speed National Guard dudes.  I had utmost respect for those cats, at least the ones who did their jobs well.    I don't know where or what Army SF was doing, even though we ran into them occasionally.  It seemed they were doing a more standard mission, and had been sort of dragged part-way into the standard Army mission.  We were up in Ghazni, and talked to an army SF patrol that was going out.  They had a fucking mini-gun on one of their trucks, but they were still rolling out on bad routes, doing the same shit we were doing, and our unit had to go bail them out and drag their blown up truck back.  Back when I was looking at going to SFAS, the whole idea was to be invisible.  I had a buddy who'd gone through the whole thing and was PCS'ing to First Group.  Two guys from our company went to Fifth and Seventh Groups, respectively, both aquaitences if not friends, and my last PSG went through selection and moved over to Group.    I don't even know what the point of that was.    Disregard all last."
MilitaryStories,2giueb,Dittybopper,2,Thu Sep 18 02:35:04 2014 UTC,"I chose not to disregard... ;o)  In my opinion the SF in vietnam were often looked upon as dilettantes. Probably because they were seen as getting too much ink in the press, in other words jealousy. Any group suffers that if they put themselves apart. On Okinawa I trained SF in the China mission, maybe 8 or 10 of them all told. My main impression was of the ones I attempted to train not being all that interested. I only had one who took the information I had to offer seriously. The method was for them to sit sidesaddle with me at my intercept position, they having their own little typing stand and headsets. They were to do the job as I did it with me showing them the in's and out's of intercept. If all went well we would eventually switch and I would sit at their position while they actually did the job live. Most took a half-assed attitude so didn't successfully, IMO, learn much. I often wondered what happened once they got into the field and couldn't lean on anyone, I knew their skills were poor. It is a good thing that I didn't have to sign off on their being good to go. Having worked side by side with these few Special Forces types made me wonder if their reputation was mostly PR or what was so special about them. They certainly didn't show me much.   Then there was that time I spent on an SF outpost and my impression was only made worse."
MilitaryStories,2giueb,djabelek,2,Thu Sep 18 14:41:02 2014 UTC,"Special Forces was mixed bag. The ones I encountered were in one of those old, triangular French forts out toward the Cambodian border. They were running a gang of merc Nungs (Cambodian tribesmen). Behind one of the only authorized minefields in Vietnam, they had local ladies, air conditioning, short-wave access to BBC, cooks, other services, and a large cash payroll every month. I'm thinking not all of that reached the Nungs and Vietnamese help.  They were making 3 to 5 day patrols. Local villagers hated the Nungs, and I can't say as I blame them. They looked like thugs and thieves. The SF guys looked pretty comfy.  But I made a point to read all about A Shau when I got back. Some serious soldiering went on there. Reads like Roarke's Drift. So there's that.  In the culture wars of the 60s, there was a lot of hero-worship going on stateside, Barry Sadler was touted as the patriot's Bob Dylan. Uh, no. And then... The movie version of The Green Berets, and it was (and still is) a hilarious disaster, featuring a too-old, overweight John Wayne and some of the most stilted and unnatural propaganda dialogue this side of North Korea. Plus they got everything wrong - uniforms, weapons, countryside, real Vietnamese - everything. 100%.   That movie absolutely destroyed the public love affair with Green Berets. Even so (and better yet) young soldiers kept volunteering and being sent here and there to quietly and efficiently accomplish difficult things. I'm good with that. The public rep is a fickle thing. I think there's a cadre of the real deal in the SF doing it right and quiet. I've got more respect for SF ever since they stopped trying to be famous. Good move."
MilitaryStories,2giueb,Military_Jargon_Bot,2,Fri Sep 19 18:33:09 2014 UTC,"What you say is true, ""SF a mixed bag."" I believe that was because their ranks were diluted as the war went on (and on). Those original SF from the 50s and early 60s were the real deal and the backbone of that organization. And, those in that SF camp in the A Shau were from the old school, that event was early war, hardly out of 1965 although it happened in early 66. Guys like them were what all the buzz was about.   What a joke ""The Green Berets"" movie was, embarrassing. I saw it in Vietnam on a larger base that allowed outdoor films to be shown, I don't remember where that was but I do remember everyone laughing their asses off and the screen being holed with M16 fire. They weren't shooting the VC actors either. Jeez it was awful. Speaking of Roarke's Drift reminds me of the movie ""Zulu"" with Michael Caine and Stanley Baker which was quite entertaining and lead me to read ""The Washing of the Spears"" by Donald R. Morris when it was published. Still a good read. Those at Roarke's Drift were indeed a special breed of soldier."

Let me story-bomb here:  OP was a game child, but kept surprising us by exhibiting a startling variety of auto-immune ways to die. The baby-to-toddler one was asthma. I remember being in a trial in another town when a message came from the court clerk - 18 month old OP is in an ambulance headed for a hospital sixty-seven miles from me. I bailed on the trial, and hot-footed it north - I was the Deputy District Attorney for the area, so I got a bye from local cops and state troopers.   I came running into the ICU where I saw a tableau that broke my heart. Crucified toddler. They had strapped boards to her arms and were running multiple IVs into her. God damn it.  Maybe not. She was awake, not aware of me. She had an expression of concentrated determination on her face that I became more familiar with as she grew older. Someone had put a stuffed bear on her bed. Strapped in as she was, oxygen under her nose, coon-eyed from asthma, she was making a tricky and difficult grab at that bear with her feet and toes. Got it, too.  ‚ÄúOkay then,‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúThis one is gonna stick around. She‚Äôll need some resources.‚Äù American life is not enough of a struggle; she was going to need a mantra, and survival image. Could be anything tough - dirt farming, emergency medicine, firefighting - but all I had was the military, the damned war.  So those are the stories she got as she grew up. Struggle, persist, survive, prevail - in war talk.   She‚Äôs better now - gymnastics, martial arts, good job, health insurance. But parents, be careful what fables you spin for your kids. They listen - I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like they do, but they‚Äôre all sneaky about it. And the next thing you know they‚Äôre calling you from the Golan.  I asked her about that before she left. Not the US military? Nope. Okay. Same war, different location, same enemy. It counts.  So I‚Äôm the one who bent the twig that grew into this tree. Am I sorry? Not a bit.

MilitaryStories,2gf382,SoThereIwas-NoShit,5,Mon Sep 15 01:30:29 2014 UTC,"Not bad. Kind of feeling your way into it. Putting on your war face. I think the New Zealanders have it right. Putting on your war face should be a group training thing.  I'm not being kind. This is genuinely good, considering. Considering in particular the letters I wrote home to my folks. I have them. Some make me curl up and burn like a leech hit with bug juice. I cringe at the sight of the packets. The horror... the horror...  Worse than that, I know there are some letters I wrote to a girl I liked but who was too crazy up into the 60s to actually read what I wrote. I hope. I break out into a cold sweat sometimes just at the realization that she was just crazy enough, she might have KEPT them! They might be out there in the world somewhere! Brrrrr...... I feel sick to my stomach.  You call this cheese-dickish and melodramatic? Oh my god! You have no idea. And if there is mercy extant in the universe, if there is a smidgeon of balm in Gilead, you will never know. Please God. I'll even be a Catholic again. Anything....  Anyway OP, I see you cooking up a writing style. You're a very good writer now. Just needed some salt, I guess."
MilitaryStories,2gf382,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Mon Sep 15 14:22:23 2014 UTC,"There's some shit I've written down that I don't even go back and try to read, because I know that I'll be pretty horrified with how I phrased everything. At the time of writing, though, it is the best it can be phrased - particularly when it's a case of trying to find words for things we don't talk about enough in the modern age and feelings that aren't meant to be discussed in polite society.  That last paragraph is a little melodramatic, doesn't make it wrong. You can still pretty much hear all the cogs turning in your head as you wrote it, through the whole thing. It's intense.  Thankyou for sharing that. It's interesting to see the raw, unpolished version of some of what you've been involved in."
MilitaryStories,2gf382,snimrass,4,Mon Sep 15 02:24:28 2014 UTC,"Hurry up, and wait.   I never kept a journal, didn't write home much either, nothing survives my journey in written form and the only bloodlust I developed came after I was shot at, like immediately after. I got pissed.   I can see your writer buds showing in your journal entries though, your voice as I know it here is there. Its rather neat to see how you've flowered."

Was a jarring read. Still is a jarring read, but it does add a lot of context to some of your comments since then. One hell of a fucking way to think about life and being alive, and how it can all just end and be over with.  As an aside - you draw?"
MilitaryStories,2gc9f8,snimrass,3,Sun Sep 14 03:06:55 2014 UTC,"I used to draw.  I did that more than anything, played music for a while, and wrote.  Haven't drawn anything for a while.

MilitaryStories,2gc9f8,tomyrisweeps,3,Sun Sep 14 16:36:49 2014 UTC,"The serious stuff.  I was pretty lucky, my two deployments could have been a lot worse, but there still isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about them.  Some stuff I've been wrapped around the axle of for eleven years.  I've noticed recently, that I don't think about some of those things as much, or in the same way.  Its the shit I've written down in this venue.  Something about writing it, and having it read.  I've still got one that'll never see the light of day, but for the most part it seems to have helped.  Writing it hasn't always been easy.  It sounds dramatic, but those Samawah stories started as a story, and became an obsession.  I had to finish it.  I few times I got all keyed up, putting myself back there, and it did fuck with me for a while.  I ended up having a full blown panic attack at work because a National Guard convoy came through.  Just fucking fell to pieces.  That was at the tail end of the Samawah stories, and now I think writing them had a lot to do with it.  But you know what?  Samawah is still there, but it isn't waiting around the corner anymore, like it did for eleven fucking years.  Somehow writing it out changed it.  Lanced the infection or some bullshit like that.  Fuck...Anyways, thanks for reading.  I put a link to some of my drawings above."

Samawah is still there, but it isn't waiting around the corner anymore, like it did for eleven fucking years. Somehow writing it out changed it. Lanced the infection or some bullshit like that.   Good to hear. Very good to hear. I know Dittybopper named you Grinder after some coffee-grinding anecdote, but initially I thought he coined the name for your Samawah stories. You were relentless. Fantastic read. Like the airborne version of Finnegan's Wake. I was exhausted for you."

MilitaryStories,2gc9f8,snimrass,2,Tue Sep 16 03:06:58 2014 UTC,"Joyce? I've tried and I can't. I just can't read him.    Of course you can't read him. No one can read him. Those who have read him didn't really. They drifted off into their own subconscious. It's not a book, it's a drug.  I suppose I should've said Proust. He is a more readable, unreadable author who was determined to document the minutia of life. But Proust can be boring.  So there you have it: The intensity and and confusion of Finnegan's Wake - begin in mid-sentence, end in mid-sentence - and the minutia of Proust, without the boring. I think if you chew on it a while, it comes out a compliment. But maybe not.  The Samawah saga was intense - helmet camera narration. Looked difficult. Really well done. Bet you're glad to have that outta yer head."
MilitaryStories,2gc9f8,tomyrisweeps,3,Tue Sep 16 13:23:03 2014 UTC,"It's hard for a quiet life to match the intensity of that kind of experience.  I have a few that I haven't even been able to go back and really think about much less write about yet, but they definitely play into my daily existence.  I still am more comfortable living out of a pack half the time."
MilitaryStories,2gc9f8,snimrass,3,Tue Sep 16 00:11:14 2014 UTC,"Not even touching on the serious side of it, but this thought just popped up when you mentioned living out of a pack.   One reason that I'm keen to go back to sea is because I can sleep so much better on the ship. Not just me being weird, either - I know a lot of navy guys who feel the same way. The little bit of rocking motion, the white noise of machinery plant, being actually tired when you get in your rack. None of this nature with its little tweety birds and trees and shit .... Man, is that some good sleep.  Shouldn't have been looking though ship pictures on the weekend. It's got me missing it, and it's not even been a year since I got off."

MilitaryStories,2g6hky,snimrass,3,Fri Sep 12 13:00:53 2014 UTC,We are far from immune to testosterone fueled stupidity in the navy. I would be naive as hell to ever try to argue that we don't do dumb shit. I'm just going to go to my grave making fun of the army. It's all lighthearted.  There was another comment conversation somewhere where I was explaining how our guys had become bored enough to start having steel ruler sword fights while on watch. Bloodshed was mandatory.

MilitaryStories,2g6hky,tomyrisweeps,2,Fri Sep 12 23:14:24 2014 UTC,I have definitely noticed that phenomenon.  Highly amusing but I usually have no idea why the hell they are doing things.

MilitaryStories,2g6hky,tomyrisweeps,2,Sat Sep 13 04:38:28 2014 UTC,Rhino Peri Peri sauce or Georgia Peach and Vidalia Onion hot sauce (you can order.them off A Burning Yearning's website). For raw heat Blaire's Ultradeath with Jersey Fury. The name is obnoxious but it is one of the two or three hottest sauces in the world and if hou can take the heat there actually is a lot of flavor.

But it wasn't the story I knew. Some other scorpion story. It sounded just like her - martial arts, uncle who does magic... I'm making excuses.  Anyway, I decided to tell the scorpion story I knew and get even with her for not telling me the one where she bit her tongue - IOW your story. I got all up into it.  I was just editing to change ""lip"" to ""tongue"" after - believe it or not - re-reading the OP without getting a clue. Then your response appeared, and I decided that somehow reddit had marked you as the OP and what the hell is there a glitch in the system? There was a glitch all right. But not in the system.

MilitaryStories,2g2nvc,snimrass,1 point,Mon Sep 15 22:33:11 2014 UTC,"My parents were blindsided by my decision to join the military. I think they expected me to do a much more ""respectable"" job, something in an office. I was 18 when I finished highschool, so there was nothing they could do to stop me, but I managed to convince them that it was a good idea because I would get a degree. Oh, and I told my mother that if I didn't join the navy I would be joining the police - my argument being that I would be far more likely to be shot as a cop than if I was on a big grey ship in the middle of the sea, so she should really be happy that I was going into the ADF.  You got one hell of a deep end introduction. It would take massive balls to go to a country where you have never lived and don't know the language, and signing up to fight, while they are in the middle of a number of conflicts. Maybe the cultural heritage has a greater pull than I can appreciate, but it's hard for me to get around that idea"
MilitaryStories,2g2nvc,DrZums,1 point,Thu Sep 11 04:28:55 2014 UTC,"I'm not really sure how thrilled my mother was at my decision.  At that point she was used to it, though.  I took what you guys in Oz call a gap year and backpacked through Europe for a while on my own.  It's not really a normal thing for Americans but it started a big international hunger in me.  I think going to the IDF was threefold:  1) Too much Holocaust history and my experience in Europe gave a good perspective on why the state exists the way it does.  2) I was stir crazy and wanted another adventure and 3) I wanted to be a soldier and go to war, or as it was called to me, I wanted to go see the beast.  I came home because of complications and a huge part of me wants to be back there and still in uniform, it suited me.  I wasn't combat, I didn't really fight, I just served and that felt pretty good.  The cultural pull is incredibly strong for some of us.  I grew up a minority and I experienced some Jew hatred in my suburban area but mostly it was just isolating.  This was a place where my holidays were celebrated by everyone, where I didn't have to explain anything and where I didn't have to be religious to be part of the community.  I'm not religious at all, if anything I probably follow more of Taoist path.  I chose to serve also because everybody does there and I wanted to stay, I would have felt like a leach in other people were defending me and all I did was sit around."

It's disappointing to see in this day and age, but with radicalisation of young people a growing issue, I really shouldn't be all that surprised, should I?  You can't stop people roaming if they're going to roam. Best you can hope is that they're safe and happy while running around the world. I was out of home pretty much straight after school. Never looked back once I'd gone. It would have been the same if I hadn't joined, it just would have verb travel or some other line of work. As much as I love my parents, I was glad to be gone."

MilitaryStories,2g0k6b,nagilfarswake,18,Wed Sep 10 16:53:01 2014 UTC,"Thank you. That's part of the saga of the siege of LZ Ellen in 1969. It dovetails into several other stories. /u/dittybopper's people saved us from a regimental-size assault. At the time of this story, we were being probed and mapped by the NVA."
MilitaryStories,2g0k6b,Dittybopper,17,Wed Sep 10 17:20:00 2014 UTC,"Wear it with pride /u/AM, you deserve it my man.  Another fine story sir. Some day I'll relate how I came to almost set a mortar pit ammo dump on fire with a thermite grenade and received a royal ass chewing for my effort from that same LT who actually did set shit on fire and almost burn the FSB down.  Anyway, your Command & Control story is a new one for me, you sneaked that in early on looks like. Don't do that, I want to read all your  scribblings. Oh how many times did I witness some C&C chopper, or several stacked up, flying around confusing everyone... many many times and all of them absolutely gleaming, polished to the nines. Dude up there issuing orders on a fight he couldn't even see, acting like the jungle was a chess board so he could apply the School Solution.   I received my ARCOM too, shitty awards ceremony and all, its citation in spook doublespeak to the point no one who reads it can gork it a'tall. I know what it was for, why? Because I wrote it up, actually the CO got myself and another fellow to write each other up, gave us a little manual on how it was done and what should be in there, the secret formula ha ha. After it, the Bronze Star we wrote each other up for, went through all the levels up and down the commands it came back downgraded to ARCOM and reading like some sorcerers apprentice had written it.   In any case I'd been back in the states about three months before the awards ceremony happened, awful thing, just nothing really, mumble mumble ""for duty above and beyond the call... bs bs bs. Army speak at its finest by golly. After, I felt, well, flat. The award was and is meaningless to me. I like my Vietnam Campaign ribbon better, it means more to me."
MilitaryStories,2g0k6b,Dittybopper,11,Wed Sep 10 19:06:49 2014 UTC,"you deserve it my man.   Thank you. Don't know as I deserve it. But I got it. So there it is. I think most of those guys were just pissed at getting shot at, and wanted to do something about it. Even so...   Some day I'll relate how I came to almost set a mortar pit ammo dump on fire with a thermite grenade and received a royal ass chewing for my effort from that same LT who actually did set shit on fire and almost burn the FSB down.   Well hell, tell it. We haven't a dumbshit El Tee story in what? Ten minutes? We can take it. We are trained to sit there and grin hard until our teeth start to crack.   Did I mention the ammo pit didn't light up? It didn't. Chicom mortar round. Most of the shrapnel dropped into the impact crater. If that had been a Russian round, would've been a whole other story.  Huh. Maybe I should clean up ""Command & Control"" and post it here. Not sure re-posts are allowed. Fuck it. The mods can delete it if they want. I won't raise a fuss.  There was a famous cartoon in Stars & Stripes that was so accurate I was surprised to see it. Some guys are in combat on the ground and there are incoming helicopters off in the distance. First guy says, ""Reinforcements?"" Second guy says, ""Naw. It's just another shift of generals.""  My medal arrived two years after I was out. It came in a brown envelope to our apartment in Denver. Little velvet box, certificate and citation. There was a return envelope and a receipt which had a box I could check if I wanted a ceremony. I checked ""Yes"".  Never heard from them again.  But then there's this. The OP is one incident from the LZ Ellen attack. The more I think about it, the more I read your descriptions of what you did in Vietnam, the more convinced I am that it was one of your units feeding us info on the planned attack. Had to be.   We were not grateful. We got all ready and had a plan, and the intelligence and radio intercepts kept trickling in. ""Still on. Any time in the next month."" We were tired of hunkering down each night and re-entrenching the extra claymores, tanglefoot and artillery ambush after sundown each day. I was pretty sure it wasn't happening.   Then they came. The NVA were Russian-trained: Practice, practice, practice, no deviation from the plan, do it just as ordered. They came exactly the way we were told they would, just as we were told they would. They walked into a world of hurt.  Would have been us in a world of hurt if it hadn't been for those radio intercepts. Wear that with your campaign ribbon, man. I'll salute it. I'm saluting now."

Now that you provided some details of that LZ Ellen attack it does begin sound like our work, especially having details of the plan. I am not 100% on that but I would give it a solid 85% that it was ASA. Best I can tell it would have been the 303rd RR Bn supporting you 1st Cav guys in that area at that time. They were also known as The Longhorns and had a Texas steer head and horns as their unofficial logo. Good group with a long history and did stellar work from all I have heard. I worked with one of their companies when our Det was augmenting them, this would have been in mid 68, we teamed up for about two weeks on some operation the Cav had going. It was not unusual for us to do joint operations like that.   The reason for the shaky timeline, the imprecise attack date, was likely the enemy not transmitting that info, or moving it. Once the actual attack order went out on the air it was ""gotcha!"" The 303rd would have acted very quickly to put that information out where it mattered.  Glad they did..."

According to RES, I upvote you more often than anyone else.  Please tell me you are compiling these stories into a book. During OCS, I remember being assigned Platoon Leader, by James McDonough. It was a good book that distilled many good lessons for small-unit command and gave a good feel for what military experience entails. It worked reasonably well. Your stuff is better. Aspiring junior officers should be reading your material and incorporating it into their own sense of leadership.  If you aren't already thinking about this please do so. If you do - I'm happy to volunteer to help you with editing/typesetting, etc because I think the things you have to say are worth being heard by a wider audience.  EDIT: I think the General is mean-mugging your cowlick. I can just hear the inner monologue: ""God dammit! It starts small with a wild hair or two, but next thing you know there'll be hippies with long hair all over the place!"""

I can write here, because other people are writing here. This is a vast discussion and sharing, unique in history - something that couldn't have existed until now. The OP proceeded directly from Apples and Cool Water and Dates. My audience - everyone's audience - is heavily weighted by military experience. I have written before - elsewhere - and been received by looks of horror and expressions of pity.   Thanks for the upvotes and the kind words about my writing. I suppose some of this stuff could get published, but I wonder if it would read the same without the comments. Including comments of others is a book would be a copyright nightmare. I wonder if reddit itself is up for publishing ebooks by various writers. I think reddit has the legal right to use anything published on reddit.  It's an idea. I am loath to abandon the discussions and digressions and story-bombs that accompany each story. We're all writing. We should all get published.  This turned into an editorial. Sorry. Thanks again for your feedback. I guess if reddit can create itself, it has the technology to publish itself. We'll see. In the meantime, what's happening here is special and perfect. Don't see that too often. I'm gonna dance with the girl that brought me for a while."

My job became an easy target, and she started trying to take a moral high road that I don't think is actually there .... shrug I can live with myself, that's all I'm asking for these days.

The couple that I do have, I have known since highschool. Random civvies get told I work for the ferries. Got sick of the sexualised bullshit I was getting from guys hitting on me when they found out I was navy. It's like they feel emasculated simply because I wear pants and boots to make my living. Plus opsec and all that.  My sister and I have other divides between us, so please don't take my comments on her as any judgement on your sister, or the relationship you have with her.

I figure it's a good filter system.  I didn't take your comment as judgement at all.  Family is family and we all have our stuff.  The fact that in mine we took such different paths is actually pretty amusing.  My dad told me the other day that at one point when my sister was in Africa or Haiti doing peace corps things (I can't remember which at that point) and I was in Israel that my mother exclaimed at him, ""What did you SAY to them?!

Will be a hard habit to break, but I probably should try at some stage.  Yeah, I don't know if they think they are being original or witty, or if they are thinking at all sometimes.

Sure, there may be reasons to criticise why we went to Iraq last time. But why protest going to Iraq now? IS need to get dealt with, sooner is probably better.

The true gentle giant that he is, he tells the kid that he is in fact a real army guy.  This kid is in awe.  He asks, ""do you guys play call of duty to practice your skills?""  The disappointment on my buddies face had me in stitches.  I was almost crying when he awkwardly told the kid that he didn't really know what call of duty was, but that what he does know is that war isn't a game and killing people isn't very much fun.    I know what you mean about being asked if it was scary.  I was asked a similarly worded question from a friends mom after returning from a deployment.  I think she asked if it was bad.

So I hope I'm not promoting myself as some charismatic, heroic leader-of-men. I wasn't. I was just the guy in charge of telling them it's time to do what they all wanted to do - get up and shoot back.  When you're freshly commissioned, one of your concerns is how you're gonna give orders to people. What if they don't obey? What if they just laugh at me? What obvious qualification do I have to be in charge of anyone?  This is one of the reasons 2LTs are so annoying. They tend to make their orders belong to someone else - ""The CO says we have to do this."" ""Some shithead up at S-3 decided we have to guard this road crossing."" Like that, like an El Tee's job is to be the bearer of bad news. Anything to avoid giving an actual order, and risking that the troops might decline, or worse yet, laugh. Because, yes, in the final analysis, some 20 year old 2LT giving orders is pretty laughable.  What you eventually learn is that the grunts don't care. They're used to the idea that someone is gonna order them around. If you're in charge, they'd just as soon you did that. Not because you're LT John Wayne and so fuckin' impressive - you aren't. They don't care about that either. Your authority is on your collar. Just tell 'em what to do.   Which is what I did. All I did. They were the ones that did the rest.

Everyone is getting sunburnt, hot and tired, it's half an hour after the whole thing was meant to kick off (and now we'll be missing lunch/will knock off late/won't get that actually important maintenance task done ...), and whichever senior sir is doing the presentation still hasn't arrived ... And still the CO is acting like this should be the highlight of everyone's day.  But to the point. Yes, that is an honour.   That is still the sort of story that they like to raise baby officers on.

So what did the Battalion Commander do for his self-awarded Silver Star?   Your troops did the right thing. But as you noted, they did it with enthusiasm. And I'm sure there are some poor former LTs out there who were in a similar situation, who still don't get why when they yelled their soldiers came out in unenthusiastic dribs and drabs, doing as much as they could to cover their arse from fire for as long as possible."
MilitaryStories,2g0k6b,SoThereIwas-NoShit,2,Thu Sep 11 00:59:28 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words, ma'am.  I linked to another story in the OP - Command & Control - which describes how the Lt Colonel got his Silver Star. I think it is an inspirational story - suitable for military colleges - which explains the inspirational effects too much time in the jungle can have on morale and respect for authority. It also - I think - explains what the term ""bush-happy"" means in a way that should be clear to even the densest REMF field grade officer.   I always liked that Star Trek episode with ""Nomad"" the all-powerful hybrid space probe that had been wandering alone through the galaxy for so long it could not imagine more than one creature named ""Kirk,"" the name of its creator. Captain Kirk commented, ""It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its Mommy.""   That show demonstrated the danger of messing with boonie rats by pestering them with commands. As Spock said - after Kirk had dazzled Nomad with a litany of its imperfections - ""A perfect demonstration of flawless logic, Captain. We are in great danger."" So they were. So was my Lt. Colonel - for much the same reasons. He almost got shot out of the sky. He did award himself a Silver Star.   Joseph Heller, eat your heart out."

For every 100 people who read that, I bet 80 do just what I did. I went back to my pagoda, and a couple of other places.    I was looking for meaning in what I had been doing and then trashing whatever answers I came up with. Everyones answers are different but mine was there. I had a job to do, and people who relied on me.   I don't know why they didn't tell us this shit right off instead of making up stuff they had to know was wrong. We were fighting for God, Democracy, the USA, capitalism over communism, freedom - everything but the truth. I dunno. I guess it sounds terrible to the civilians.   Some morning you wake up - after being messed with and dragged half-way across the world - and realize that you're fighting for the guy on your left and the guy on your right. That's it. These guys here - who you hardly even know - those are your guys. If someone tries to fuck with any one of 'em, you intend to kill him. No shit. You intend to do that. It's a surprising thing to intend, no?  Sounds like you had a pagoda moment, OP, then you folded the Universe like oragami down to the size of you, and your guys, and a job you knew how to do. That was the meaning, they were the reason, and it all made a horrible, gang-banger kind of sense. But it wasn't horrible. It was peaceful, right?   I just realized that I did the same thing at the end of the first part of Year of the Snake. Those people I was with were my people. I knew how to do a job for them. That was it. That's what I was supposed to do. First thing since I enlisted that made sense."
MilitaryStories,2fxhal,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Tue Sep 9 22:41:23 2014 UTC,"My personal theory on why you so rarely get the straight stuff going in is... public relations weenies. Most people who talk to a recruiter don't sign up, of the ones who do a fair number don' get through training. The cold, honest truth from day one would have a lot of civvies thinking we're more brutal bastards than we are.   Gangbanger sense, huh? I always thought of it as more... clannish. Celtic background and genetic memory maybe but even inside the Army there is a certain sense of other squads or platoons or companies and so on being ""other"" no matter how like your guys they are. There is still that bond but it becomes more ztrained the further it is stretched and I know from my own experience there can be a less-than-friendly rivalry between companoes. Got a scar on my right hand from the broken tooth of a guy in Charlie company.  It is strange how willing you get to go right to the hilt for the guys you march with, sweat with, bleed with.

I didn't completely buy into all of that and truth be told I really didn't have dog in that fight except in an abstract way. As you learned, and I too, you can't truly endure it all without bringing it down to working to aid those around you, taking satisfaction in working your mission knowing it does actually make a difference.

Fuck me!  You got that much ass?  I only fucked 'Angela' twice.  Still $40 well spent, but damn.  Good NCO's.  My PSG who left just before we went to Iraq was the finest NCO I ever worked for.  My SL in Iraq was the second best.  My SL in Afgh. was the third best.  I lucked out.  I've seen some really terrible leadership, worked for some, and tried my hardest to be like the good ones.  The highest compliment I've ever gotten was from one of my most recent Joe's.  He got his stripes, I was out, and I was ribbing him and calling him Sergeant.  Not Sar'nt, but Sergeant.  He told me that he hoped he could be the NCO for his guys that I was for him.  Blew me the fuck away.  Thanks SFC John and SSG Rad, for showing me the way.  LRRS-D.  Fuckin' A.  My hat's off to you.    I can't remember what they were called in Afghanistan, but we got intercepts of Talidude radio traffic because of guys like you.  They wouldn't let us prep the target, or give us CAS until we had a TIC, but at least we knew where we were gonna get hit and do test fires in the right area.

I don't doubt for a second your guys cleared a route someone I knew walked down.

Always love to read those parts of your stories - I'm a sucker for some good scenery. Fucking sad to hear it got bulldozed, that's a real pity after all the work to keep it alive."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,snimrass,7,Sat Sep 6 03:48:41 2014 UTC,"It wasn't lost on me.  It was as strange as it was downright awesome to take my first bath in a month in the Euphrates River.  We'd seen the Ziggurat of Ur in the distance on our way to Baghdad.  I saw the bier that Alexander was laid on, saw the ice cellars, and stood in front of the Lion of Babylon.  Iraq is a beautiful country.  Maybe it was just in my head, but it felt like the ancient blended into our daily reality.  Afghanistan was the same, but more austere, and we had less immersion with the locals."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,snimrass,7,Sun Sep 7 00:12:12 2014 UTC,"This is probably tangential to the point, but was the first thing that came to mind after reading your story.  When we stopped in Thailand, we had the opportunity to go out and visit Hellfire Pass. Stopped at a few places along the way - the Bridge over the River Kwai, the war cemeteries. There's a lot of cemeteries on the way out there.  But the Pass itself was jarringly beautiful. The path through the rough cut rock, in the middle of the green, living forest. Birds singing. Sun coming through the leaves. One of the most peaceful places I have ever visited in my life.   But knowing that the peace of the place belies the history. Knowing that many of men of my country (and others) died there making that pass, in horrid conditions, under the hand of the enemy, in a strange, truly foreign land.  So the two things can exist side by side. Beauty and war. Peace and horrific violence. In your case, they managed to coexist both in time and space. You've got your orchard, like AM has his pagoda.

It was weird seeing them.  It was peace-time, then, but it always brought home to me what my profession actually was.  It did in a way that nearly getting shot in training didn't.  It hit me the way the Vietnam Memorial didn't, before I went to war.  Boy, was that a hell of a thing to see after Iraq.  It was a beautiful spot.

I've been thinking about trying to write about The Sapper Lounge for a while.  Maybe this is a start.    Brevity can be good, and that was as long as I wanted it to be, but every time I read after hitting SUBMIT, I realize how much I've left out, or that the wheat wasn't waist high until much later.   An army in the field is a destruction engine, and fucking awesome at it too. One has to have witnessed it to know it, we know it, civilians don't have a clue.   After I first got out, and moved home, my mom was visiting and asking something about Iraq or 'Freeing The Iraqi People'.  She managed to touch a nerve.  I told her that was bullshit.  ""Our job was to kill people and break shit.""  She actually told me she didn't believe me.  Go figure.  We were pretty nice about most of it, but Destruction Engine is right on."

Today I see is your first Reddit cakeday, it's so hard to believe that all the stories you've put on here have been within just the past 365 days.  It's comforting to see that someone who went through all the shitty (I need a much better word there) things you have and come out the other side. . .   I've tried for 10 minutes now to think of the word I want to use there, but just can't get one. You just seem like a wiser person than most, that really appreciates what there is. I hope that makes sense.  Thank you for your stories and your perspective. Between your stuff, AM, Dittybopper, and everyone else on here I hope I can better understand what people in combat go through, how you deal with it, and what it makes you think about."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Mon Sep 8 16:27:43 2014 UTC,"Thank you for reading, and thanks for the kind response.  I can't speak for any of the other submitters here, but I have a lot to try to say about War (and that includes the peace-time military, because that's just preparing for War).  In a way it's cathartic, because there are people here who've known the language longer than me.  I also hope that people who don't speak it will understand it, and take something away from these stories.  My own experiences were pretty hardcore compared to a lot of others, and pretty tame compared to a lot of others.  These are my personal stories, and I leave my Brothers mostly out because I can't speak for their perspective.  Again, thanks for reading.  I'm glad you dig the stuff."

Just dropped by to wish OP a happy reddit cake day, and say ""Hey!"" to all those folks who were kind enough to mention me in passing. An honor. But I am at a loss for words because you said everything I would've said, only better, and more than a few things I didn't even think of. I see no need for Atheist Chaplaining, if indeed, there was ever any need to begin with.   Orchards. These are NOT unimportant things, for all the stories of them do not have the flash-bang appeal of some of the grittier episodes. Orchards. Pagodas. Sunsets... why is there no name for the unexpected lacunae in the narration of war? A deep breath, a breeze, a moment in the shade... I remember mine. If I remember them, they must be important, right?   I'm gonna go puzzle this out. Good story OP. Got me thinking."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Mon Sep 8 16:12:21 2014 UTC,I think there is a word for them.... oasis. These places are little havens in the midst of a terrain that can burn what is human out of us and allows us to replenished. Just my thoughts on it.
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,djabelek,2,Tue Sep 9 03:18:58 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts. ""Oasis"" is a good choice. The trouble is that guys crawling through the desert coming on an oasis has been so overused in comics and political cartoons that it is very difficult to conjure up the actual suffering that attends struggling across a desert. I'm not sure the concept we're looking for can make headway against all that cliche.   We're talking about the effects that seemingly normal, everyday scenes can have on the mind of a person who experiences an unexpected cessation (usually temporary) of struggle, privation and danger. Sometimes there is an Arjuna-moment without all the drama. The release of pressure causes your mind to extend itself outwardly into the scene and inwardly into yourself. Without becoming insignificant - like, say, staring too long at the night sky - one becomes a part of something larger, older, calmer, wiser and certainly more beautiful.  At some point the vision fades, and we either live with it as we remember it, or being egotistical monkeys, we imagine some great spiritual message: ""I'm doing what I should be doing."" ""All the world is an illusion caused by suffering."" ""I need to go on pilgrimage."" ""It's time to divorce my wife.""  Something like that.  My message is that there isn't any message. It is as true a vision as any trauma you've experienced. Everything you see, thought or felt is true - in a way. I'm not sure that such things are capable of supporting a great pile of your emotional baggage, and I'm pretty sure it does pay to pursue them.  I am too jumpy a monkey, too unreliable and uncertain to follow so ethereal a guide. I am too like Caliban not to take Caliban's advice:  Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,  Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.  Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments  Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices  That, if I then had waked after long sleep,  Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,  The clouds methought would open and show riches  Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,  I cried to dream again.  What you remember is not what happened. What happened already happened - you are already affected. No need to make it into something. It already is something.   But crying to dream again? Yeah. That. Some days, even this late in the game, I want to go back there."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,snimrass,3,Tue Sep 9 12:59:05 2014 UTC,"I think I see your point. Maybe the strong association with the word and the emotion is due to an experience of mine I need to write up, maybe it is just something my mind refuses to give up. I thinm there is something spiritual to it though. Not religious, thinking we know god's face is a conceit, that we know god's mind is a blinding one. But like you said, when those pressures release and our mind is free to expand we do get something of a larger perspective that may last a moment of the span of our remaining years... and that capacity is a wondrous thing."

There's that kernel inside of the thing that I call my mind, buried so deep, but I've come close to seeing a handful of times.  I've never touched it, maybe heard it, but I know it's there.  I was much closer to it, back then.  I could feel it when I tipped my head back and stared at the galaxy in east Paktika.  You can't see the stars like you do there.  They light the world on a zero ilum night.  You could actually see by them.  Our oldest ancestors never knew darkness but for cloud cover or volcanoes or fires.  I could hear it on those early mornings in Al Dora, when it was quiet, on the roof top.    I could almost see it at the edge of my vision, but if I tried to look at it it changed places and got further away..."

MilitaryStories,2flxb4,snimrass,3,Wed Sep 10 16:08:03 2014 UTC,"Here's my take, standing on the outside looking in:  It doesn't have a name because it will never exist until each individual stumbles upon it. You don't know it will be there, and you can't be expecting it in advance. The beauty of the pagoda and of the orchard is that you don't realise how something so simple can matter so much until you are actually in that moment. You can know that you're uneasy, broken, lacking in some thing to fill a little hole inside you, but you can't know what will fix it until it's right there, in front of you. It's not like the craving for something that you already know - not like wanting a cold beer, or a hot shower, or a woman. The orchard and the pagoda don't show up as the way of satisfying a physical requirement; they end up being the solution for something hurting in your soul."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,djabelek,3,Tue Sep 9 02:12:20 2014 UTC,"I have to politely disagree, and I'm only speaking for myself.  I don't think it has anything to do with solace or comfort, although both of those things come with it in their own way.  I do think it comes with adversity, but only if you've never known a truly shit life, and have the time and opportunity to examine the self from an outside perspective (whether you know you're doing it or not doesn't matter).  The ways I've seen God, or Life, or There Isn't Any Good Name For It, have been through intense experiences.  A whole lot of LSD was the first time.  Not the first time I'd dropped a lot of acid, but the first time I realized I was doing something more important than ""drugs"".  I saw the universe and looked back on it that night, and felt like I'd found what a lot of people call 'Religion', except it wasn't religion.  It was a realization of how small we all are.  Later, there were days of wondering if I'd be around the next morning.  Days of being fully prepared to die.  Be gone.  Be no more.  As I understand it, dead is dead.  Maybe you can leave something behind, and maybe you think it matters while you're still not-dead, but once you're in a box or a bag it doesn't matter.  I didn't want to die or get killed, but it was a practical reality.  It was a relatively obvious outcome of the situation, and entirely dependent on luck.  Not a whole lot of us got killed, but it happened, and it was random.  Getting killed in a firefight would be the best way, an IED the most likely.  Once the reality of the situation sunk in, for me at least, it didn't matter anymore.  The skin and fat and muscle and bone were rubbed away, leaving the soul open.  Every day is my last.  ""Every day is my last"" is pretty melodramatic.  Stuff for movies or stories, but sometimes it was maybe true.  True in theory if not fact.  Those were the nights and mornings where I felt closest to whatever Ether it is we come from and return to.  Where I felt the connection that I cannot explain.  Where I almost found my soul, but it slipped away like a trout, splashing and diving through the surface just long enough for me to know that it was something that I'd held.  Something I wasn't capable of understanding, but capable of touching and seeing and smelling.  Those experiences were as external as they were internal, and had nothing to do with anything human.  Ephemeral.  Butterfly's or Mosquitoes at a distance."
MilitaryStories,2flxb4,djabelek,2,Tue Sep 9 03:50:36 2014 UTC,"First up, disagree all you want, this conversation started off the back of your story. And I'm talking from a different set of experiences - never been shot at, but there's other sides to being a bit fucked on in life. Maybe my take on it was a little too offhand, but when I over-edit things like that I fuck them up, and lose the whole point of what I'm trying to say.  I wasn't trying to talk about God or religion. If there is some God, I've never seen him and he's a prick. Should have avoided getting spiritual, never been good at it. But yes, we are damn small, tiny, insignificant. Individually, we don't matter at all. All of our bullshit squabbles, wars, what do they matter to the universe? If the actions of nations don't matter, then you can't even argue that we matter as individuals. One person's pain ain't worth fuck all. I'm not being sarcastic there either.  I don't know if I was actually talking about solace. Maybe I was, and I didn't know it. I don't have that at the moment, don't have some place that I've been that's helped ease this hurt. You've found your soul tipping your head back to look at the stars, and you've God at the end of the chemical reactions of a drug trip. All I've got is this black fucking hole that I can't seem to ever fully patch up. I'm angry and tired from carrying this fucking hurt around, but at the same time, what does it fucking matter? It fucking doesn't. I am tiny in the world. We all are. None of us fucking matter.  My apologies for that being sad and angry and bitter and pissed off. Some of it is definitely aimed at you, but not for any good reason, but mostly from jealousy or some bullshit like that. Damn you and your beautiful poetry about horrible situations, and your uncanny talent of making scenery. Damn you for finding something more than I've managed. I'm angry at myself for this weak fucking bullshit that I'm feeling at the moment. You touched a nerve, but it's my fault that I can't fix this weak spot.   Fuck it. Go enjoy your damn orchard."

Sore point, bad day; good euphemisms for trying to explain that what you said hit me harder than it should have. Was trying to start bottling things up again, get the lid back on. Stop reaching out, stop being a hassle. One less reason to be hating on myself. That went well. Fucked it in no time at all, because what you said got to me. Fucking embarrassing.

Somehow that got him more than anything else.  His mother carried him to their humvee while they were doing whatever.  Supposedly a swing set had fallen on him.

All he had to do was run straight ahead until he saw wire.  He made a 90 degree turn in front of multiple machine guns.  Luckily it was the blank fire, after the dry fire, and not the live fire yet.  He didn't get to participate in the live fire portion.  In Iraq my retard boy had an hour of radio watch.  Radio check every fifteen minutes.  He brought up the fact that he couldn't get a response half an hour or forty-five minutes into his shift.  The radio was off.  That was the first time he did it.  My boy in Second Squad, Iraq, watched in horror as an Infantry Lieutenant poured gasoline all over the underbrush and lit it on fire, burning himself in the process, in order to 'burn off the brush'.  They were looking for munitions.  Mortar rounds started cooking off.  Give me a little while, and I can come up with more.

MilitaryStories,2fedfa,Sublimecat,25,Sat Sep 6 04:17:54 2014 UTC,"""Hi, I'm your new guy!"" Continued...  Eventually I'd have to go over and show him, again. I once caught him listing to AFVN radio, Armed Forces Vietnam radio which was broadcast all over the country. That is a no no, playing fuck around listening to Rock and Roll while supposedly working the Purd for targets. Ass chewing. He had trouble with his enciphering too, all information on targets put out on the DF net were encrypted on a one-time pad. I'd hear him broadcast to the DF net phonetically mouthing the letters and numbers, pause as he listened for receipt conformations, then hear puzzled query's from the two other DF teams...  ‚ÄúDriftwood 24, 37 here, check your pad please, over.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis is 15, ditto here driftwood 24, something ain't jake.‚Äù  I'd wait, losing sleep, he would then begin to commit a COMSEC error by reusing the same sheet of coding to correct his errors... Time for a lesson.  ‚ÄúNo no and no, never attempt to reuse even part of a sheet, just cancel the screwed mission, burn that sheet, and begin all over and encipher the whole mission on the next sheet. Even doing that is not a wonderful idea because you have then double enciphered the same information on two sheets. Don't say a word, just begin again. Thanks, I'll be back in two hours to relieve you.‚Äù  The topper though was him being a natural born slob, I'd go to relieve him at the Purd and there would be cracker wrappers, opened C-ration cans half full of glop, cigarette butts and his body oder, he never bothered to clean up after himself and taking a bath or clean fatigues seemed foreign to him. Out here no one was giving a shit if your uniform was less than perfect, no one ever shined their boots for instance. But there is normal wear and tear and then my private, a genuine slob. I finally told him that his mother was currently unable to police up after him and that he should do so himself. Fat lot of good that did.   He was limping along with the code, some aspects of the job were seeping in, drip drip drip...   And then he tried to kill me. No shit GI.  He had been issued an M16 but had never been trained on it. He had qualified in basic on the M14 and had never seen an M16 until one was handed to him. I took it upon myself to show him the M16 ropes so one afternoon we sat down on some crates in a concrete room, our living quarters, and I introduced him to his weapon. I explained its care and feeding, I dissembled it, explaining how to clean each part, put it back together and showed him how to load a mag and how to charge the weapon, where the selection switch was and all like that. I intended to take him out to the perimeter later and have him zero. I handed him the rifle and asked him to do a take-down and reassemble. He came to a dead stop trying to remove the hand guard, the first step in disassembly. Just as with all else I had to patiently walk him through each step, we finally got it all done. Then, as if to show me he'd learned well he stood up and inserted a magazine and charged the weapon.  ‚ÄúLike this, right?  ‚ÄúYeah, its ready, all you have to do is pull the trigger she's off to the races.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLike this...‚Äù and he fucking does it!  Rip goes the rifle, just as God intended. Zippp go the rounds careening off of concrete walls tearing chunks out of the roof, instant cloud of concrete dust, that smell, the bullets zinging and buzzing all around us. I hit the dirt, the floor, he is last seen standing with the trigger fully depressed and a perfect ‚ÄúO‚Äù for a mouth, eyes the size of saucers. That little cog in his brain blocked by a wood shaving, the one that would have told him to release the goddamned trigger. By some miracle we weathered the bullet storm without a scratch. My knee caps and an elbow were torn all to hell from having hit the floor. Shaking like a leaf I took the rifle from his stiff hands and eased him back down on a crate. Fortunately the magazine had only had 10 rounds in it. Before I could get out ‚ÄúYou motherfucker...‚Äù in roars an infantry staff sergeant bellowing at the top of his lungs.  ‚ÄúWhat in the fuck is going on here! Whats that firing!‚Äù  ‚ÄúHim‚Äù I said, pointing. ‚ÄúHe's the one you want to speak with sergeant.‚Äù  An ass chewing to beat the band and a delight to witness.  Fini - copyright 2014"

It was one of those hot, dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks. Anything can happen.    Raymond Chandler (1888-1959), ""Red Wind"" (1938), _Trouble Is My Business_ (1939 ~ 4 novellas)   I nominate this paragraph for the next championship match:   A head taller than I, red hair and freckles, loud guy undeserved know-it-all attitude. I guessed New York, upstate somewhere. I was right, Albany, a smallish town with short summers and god awful winters. This kid was green to life and I pictured his teen years driving driving around in a hopped up Ford with his buddies, going from one drive-in to the next cruising for excitement but telling each other they were looking for pussy. Somehow I doubted this one had ever been close to a pussy, and if he had he'd fumbled around until the girl went dead cold and snapped all that sweet stuff shut. That is about the way he acted out here, bluffing his way, trying to cover up his lack of knowledge and Cherry Red status.    My God, OP. That's brutal.

I get the bright idea to take a shortcut to the TOC one afternoon because I'm way eager to receive my issue of two-beer's. So instead of a wee detour on the usual path I take the direct route to the open window of the 50 foot long shack across a narrow two lane blacktop road (QL-91) that bisected our perimeter. This little outpost I'm on is a vehicle checkpoint between Saigon and Can Tho in the Delta. Between the PRD-1 position are a bit of grass and weeds, a small stream, the road then the shack/TOC. I am trotting through the grass and notice a very verdant rectangle of vegetation on my side of the creek, no alarm bells went off and I put on a bit more speed to jump the stream. When I hit that patch I went in over my head in a shit pit, hit firm ground at the bottom and launched myself up and out landing half in and half out and projectile vomiting into the stream. I had broken through the crust of a rice farmers shit storage pit, human shit, and it was slimy and fully ripe. The smell produced instant gagging and vomit, overwhelming is the word for it. I was covered head to boot sole, I scrambled into the water and began attempting to wash it off, not much luck and that smell, you couldn't escape it and my gag reflex was in overtime. Eventually I made it to the shower point and scrubbed and scrubbed but it was several days and more showers before the stench finally went away. The uniform I threw away and burned.   Twist: Dad fell into one too while serving in Korea during the war. At the time he was running off a hill to distance himself from a Chinese artillery attack."

Wait a sec...  Man, you grossed out OP! And she's a professional, commissioned shit slinger for a large Anglophone (sort of) Navy! If there had only been a tapeworm... But alas. Good story though. Truly gross.  Back in the day, the 6th Fleet (the American one) used to have stories about military officers who imbibed too freely at the cocktail parties held on the fantails of American cruisers docked in the Bay of Naples. There were a variety of hilarious circumstances, but they all ended with someone falling into Naples bay, and then contracting at least one disease in every body orifice. These stories were popular.  I'm glad that didn't happen to you, DB, because it would've been so funny, and I'd feel terrible about that.

I think they would rather have watched us fall in, but the officers made threats if we did.  Yeah, I got my shots, took my pills. So did those guys who fell in Naples bay - but there are some things that thrive on toxic soup that are spawn of Cthulhu and laugh at modern medicine. I'm glad you were lucky.

I remember sitting by the body of a dead NVA - someone had searched him and put his little notebook beside him. I remember realizing that most of the NVA dead had little notebooks with delicate writing on flimsy paper of what looked like notes and poems. Were they all poets? When they set out on the Ho Chi Minh Trail did they plan to write a goup novel? WTF? Are there no college deferments in North Vietnam?  It humanized them in a way the body sitting in front of me couldn't. What the hell were we doing? Fighting Communism? I wanted to yell in that field of bodies, ""Any Communists here?"" I bet there wasn't even one. What the hell...  Okay OP, no more story time. You just did a quantum leap in writing style in two parts. Your other stories have been hand-held-camera quality - jerky transitions, shaky runs from on point to another, stuff popping up out of the corner of the screen. You wrote really good moonshine - alarming, confusing, raw, immediate, dangerous.  This... this story was eighty year old single malt Scotch. Smooth, compelling, easy transitions, nice adventurous setup, and a polite-but-uncomfortable kick at the end - O Henry, go back and read it again, everything just changed.   How you do dat?

When I posted Dark, I just casually googled the Gunny. It turns out that I hadn't done a web search for the Gunny in maybe 20 years. I was not prepared for the sudden massive input of pictures and data. Put me right off my feed.  Because the rush from those pictures and those Vietnam images was real. It was realer than reality is now - me sitting here typing. Memories fade - you gain distance from them without even meaning too. It slowly becomes a story you read a long time ago. Yet when the memories come crashing back all at once - a voice from the past, a picture, a smell, someone else who was there - it makes the reality around you seem barely there at all.

Not girlishly either - more in a way that makes people wonder if they should really be letting me have matches.  Still ... If you're not drawing blood from each other, that's always good. Our guys started having sword fights in the machinery control room, using their 6"" rule (little steel ruler, gets used for everything - coffee stirrer, makeshift screwdriver, paint lifter, bilge scraper ... the list goes on). Well, those fuckers are sharp. So when they got told that sword fights were not on, they resorted to whacking each other with the velcro part of the shoulder patch (we have removable velcro patches on our cams, rather than sewn on). That also ended in bloodshed, and questions about why so many of our guys had grazes on their faces. Everyone was fucking happy to get into port (and this might be an indicator of why we drink so much when the opportunity arises)."

MilitaryStories,2ez85i,snimrass,4,Sun Aug 31 00:06:00 2014 UTC,"So every navy is gay? Sorry. Civilian now, but can't not talk shit about other services.   Uh, yes. Very gay. But the military in general is like that (I know that all the jokes about the USMC have to be based in some sort of fact). Never known so many straight dudes who are so obsessed with other men's junk. Seriously, just everyone whip it out, feel each other up, and get it over and done with.   Back in the day before women were allowed on ships, a lot of guys used to do naked watchkeeping in the machinery spaces - safety boots, socks, hearing protection only (and if you get a stag department, I think it still happens sometimes these days). I just don't get it - why would you want your unprotected dick swinging about near a whole heap of hot machinery? Wouldn't it just get in the way? Boobs are bad enough when you're trying to lean over equipment, and at least they're somewhat contained.  Also, I should start ragging on you lot more. You'll be hearing more of it next year when I actually have to work with army again. Will need to take it out on someone.  There's a surprising number of army who can't get their head around the ocean. Fair enough. There's different levels of crazy though. Submariners are the next level down - they have some very odd ideas about what an appropriate level of oxygen is. I admire the hell out of them, but not sure if it's for me.  Was talking to /u/AM about the navy way a little while back - I think a lot of it is just being used to the idea that you could end up dead in a really quick and impersonal manner. If you go over the side and aren't noticed straight away, well, you're done for, particularly at night.   And if it actually comes to the navy going to war, rather than stopping smugglers and enforcing embargoes, well that impersonal death becomes a lot more likely. We train for fighting the damage if a missile hits the ship, while knowing that if it actually happens, we're dead. We're not going to be able to dodge it - hell, half the point of the frigate is to act as a missile shield for the larger, more important ships. Might not all die straight away, although a lot of people would go in the impact and the jet fuel fire that goes with it. More will go when the ship breaks apart and sinks. Some might make the life rafts, but we probably won't see the same diplomacy that there was during the world wars - I'm not sure the other side will stop to try to pick up the survivors. And if it's a torpedo from a sub, it's likely the first we'll know if it is the ship's back breaking as the fucker goes off underneath us.  That comes out sounding all depressing, but it really isn't. Nothing I can do about it, other than make sure the engines keep going - it's someone else's job to fight the war, another's to drive the ship, someone else again to keep the gun firing. Have to trust in that. And means that you just don't worry about it - if it comes, it comes."

I felt terrible, and had the utmost respect, for our mechanics in Afghanistan.  They couldn't shoot back, were in the largest and least armored vehicle in our eleven vehicle convoy, and did some of the toughest work.  All while relying on somebody else (us) to keep them safe.    Then again, we treated our medics and mechanics like gold when they weren't being used and abused.  I'll take being on my feet and fighting, for dying any day."

Although it's different on a ship to being in country. I don't know if it makes sense, but naval warfare is a lot less personal - it's ship vs. ship. On the ground, there would be the awareness that some other individual is trying to kill you as an individual. Your mechanics and medics have got it really hard compared to us."

MilitaryStories,2eev7i,snimrass,5,Sun Aug 24 04:06:24 2014 UTC,"Glad you got a kick out of it.  That was a fun story to recall.  That's the sort of barracks or bar story that always began, ""So there I was, no shit...""   How often did guys hit their heads badly on the way down?   Pretty common thing.  Usually it's the landing that gets people.  I had a string of winter jumps where I seemed to come in backwards.  The technical term, in the Airborne community, is Feet-Ass-Head.  It's an alternate method of the standard PLF(Parachute Landing Fall), used when the jumper's six o'clock is oriented to the direction of travel, or downwind side.  There's nothing you can really do about it.  Your feet hit the ground, your ass hits the ground, and the back of your head hits the ground.  It hurts.  It's anywhere between 'well that sucked', to guys chasing an unconscious trooper being dragged across the DZ by his parachute.  My personal worst was having my leg snarled in my suspension lines while I was being dragged(I think I somersaulted backwards after I hit), knowing that there was something I was supposed to do, but not knowing what it was.  It was probably only a few seconds, but it felt like eternity, trying to fight through the fog in my brain.    As soon as you hit the ground, you're supposed to pop one of your canopy releases so that your 'chute deflates and you don't get dragged.  It's as simple as pulling a metal cover down, on either shoulder, putting your thumb through a wire loop, and pulling down.  That's it.  It was difficult to figure out.  On most of the rest of the FHA's, I just had a really bad headache.  This was common stuff.  The description of the lost jumper in the OP comes from a time I ran across my buddy from our HQ Platoon.  He wouldn't stop asking the same questions over and over.  'Where are we going?  What are we doing?  Where are we going?  Why are we out here?  What's going on?  Where are we going?'  We just kept him with us until we got to our AA.  It was really annoying, and we were also really worried about him.  How he got out of his harness, had all of his sensitive items, he even had his NOD's on, I don't know.  He didn't even remember getting to our AA when we gave him shit about it later. I ran across my PL once, at a turn-in point, and same thing, but not as bad.  You'd see it occasionally, especially at the turn-in points.  Usually they'd get policed up by other jumpers, brought to the turn-in's, or they'd make it there by themselves, and get left with the 'chute detail or get picked up by somebody from their unit.  There was a very ingrained sense of 'driving on' at the time.  It's probably still the same.  The only people I personally ever knew of actually getting/seeking medical attention were a total of one.  My buddy Dave, who bayonetted the rat and shot a goose, and that was two days after breaking two or three ribs on the jump, and rucking and being on mission the whole time since.  That was longer than expected.  Hope that answers your question, or gives some insight at least.  As always, thanks for reading!"
MilitaryStories,2eev7i,illuzion25,3,Mon Aug 25 02:22:45 2014 UTC,"No, that definitely gave some insight. I'm surprised that there's not more broken bones from hard landings, but I'm guessing that most of the time you come down facing the right way, all the training pays off and things go as easily as they can when you've just stepped out of an aircraft. Still, that's probably the best example of ingrained/instinctive training that I've heard of - getting that bad a knock to the head and still getting up and going through all the right actions in the right order.  Hope you (and the others) don't mind me asking about things every so often. You lot are interesting."

One of the odd things about ASA Vietnamese Lingies is they learned North Vietnamese accents at DLI. Whenever they opened their mouths to converse with South Vietnamese eyes opened.  I have a buddy, a non-Morse intercept type, who intercepted the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 68. His intercept was the first the West knew of the move and it involved a lost Soviet tank unit asking directions and breaking COMSEC by reporting their location in the clear. A quick look at the map and a DF shot confirmed them inside Czechoslovakia and soon a message was off to the White House. You know the type of message.   Thanks again for bringing your story."

He starts out as a riverboat gunner in China pre-WWII, then spends the first part of the war being shipped around the Pacific theater alternately being bombed by Nips, shot by Nips, charged by screaming Nips wielding swords, held prisoner (briefly) by Nips, and finally ends up at Guadalcanal where he has to fight two or three (the record, and his memory, are unclear on this point) Nips with his bare hands.  There's also something with a giant lizard?  I don't know.  Anyway, once he gets some time with his family (all of the male members are vets) and their quiet, similarly-damaged company restores some of his sanity, he's put into a special ops unit where they get in the back of a truck and drive around Italy doing sneaky things.  When they first arrive, the fact that he (an enemy Marine!) can simply sit under a tarp in the back of a truck and drive around their countryside with impunity is infuriating.  It is almost a personal insult to him that any military would be so careless as to allow this sort of behavior to go unchecked, and he has to fight the impulse to jump out of the truck and start lecturing them on how to run a proper campaign.

MilitaryStories,2e7zy3,Dittybopper,20,Thu Aug 21 22:07:52 2014 UTC,"Part 2 and done... Joe worked COMSEC  One thing about the LRRP net however, was when things went way off of mundane and sometimes exploded into pure life or death drama, such as a team getting discovered by the enemy. The LRRP teams were small, often five or six heavily armed men who did not seek contact normally. They were there to snoop and report then get out with no one the wiser. They were well supported with everything at hand, artillery, helicopter gunships, fast movers (jets), Spooky gunships and reaction teams of troops on stand-by to come and rescue them if needed. If a team was compromised they always had a plan in place and immediately went into action to escape the contact. The result was often a running gunfight between the team and the pursuing enemy; the LRRP team unassed the area and ran for a PZ, Pick-up Zone, a landing area for the extraction choppers that were racing to rescue the team. The LRRP teams were good, expert at infiltrating enemy territory, gathering intelligence and getting out without being seen, heard or suspected. It was a vicarious experience for Joe and I to eavesdrop on their operations.  Through their radio transmissions you could picture yourself out there in the dark with the jungle funk in your nostrils, the jungle gone silent now except for the footfalls of an enemy squad, or platoon,  company, or regiment (it happened) passing behind you. You‚Äôre expecting a bullet between the shoulder blades at any second‚Ä¶long, long seconds. You know your buddy is covering your ‚Äòsix,‚Äô watching them pass, eyes averted, not daring to risk looking even one of the enemy in the face for fear of triggering their sixth sense. You‚Äôve got your reaction planned if the shit hits the fan, you know which way you will roll, what part of the jungle you will fire into and the direction you will run if it comes to that. Sweat drops off the end of your nose and crashes into the dry leaves as your heart beats a high loud whine, surely they can hear it. You‚Äôve fingered the fire selection switch on your weapon assuring that you are ready - knowing that you are not because you just don‚Äôt want THIS. You want to open your mouth and take a deep breath but you would know from experience that your heart sound will loudly escape through your open mouth - and reveal you! Actually you know better, but keep your mouth closed anyway. Or maybe it‚Äôs all the other way with you and you welcome the contact, want it; maybe that‚Äôs who you are!  So, you see, one‚Äôs imagination could safely run amok sitting in the COMSEC van and listening to the LRRP‚Äôs do what they did in their corner of the war. Sometimes, off in the distance, one could hear and see the firefight, watching the gunships work out around the teams while they breathlessly adjusted fire and ran for their lives to the PZ. The RTO or the team leader alternately whispering or screaming, cussing, requesting, insisting that help come quickly cause ‚ÄúTHE FUCKERS ARE ALL AROUND US!‚Äù And so they must be judging by the AK fire plainly heard each time the team‚Äôs radio transmitted. No need to imagine now because for Joe and I the show was coming in live and in color, audio all the way up past desperate. Listening too and watching ‚Äòthat‚Äô, you would be about as close as you ever wanted to be to a running gunfight on a LRRP team; I was anyway.  Joe and I were listening one evening when a LRRP team lost the race. To tell the truth, I don‚Äôt remember much past the high points of what Joe and I heard that evening. It happened fast, over in minutes except for LRRP Control calling and calling to the now silent team, his voice the loneliest sound I ever heard in Vietnam.  I happened to show up at the COMSEC van after having been relieved off of PRD-1 Direction finding duty that evening. Joe immediately gestured to me to put on a pair of headsets as he patched them into the radios.  By the look on his face I knew it was something serious. A team had been discovered by an unknown number of NVA, Joe explained hurriedly, and they were now running for it, but each time they moved they ran into more NVA. We only had the radio transmissions; couldn‚Äôt see or hear the firefight. Once my headsets were in place I heard the LRRP team leader running and firing as he tried to coordinate supporting fire. They had a couple of wounded and were trying to carry them. The weather was hampering the rescue and support effort; the clouds were almost on the deck and it was raining hard. Silently, Joe and I listened as the team were run to ground and the NVA closed on their position in among some boulders. Each time the team leader transmitted, the flood of small arms fire could be heard, explosions, long strings of AK fire pointedly backing up the team leader‚Äôs running commentary on what was happening. His voice had gone over to a sort of shaky warble suffused with a mixture of forced steadiness and contained fear. Anything you ever wanted to know about an up close firefight was in that voice. The team was putting up one heck of a fight, but the volume of NVA fire was increasing second by second.   The team leader couldn‚Äôt be convinced to deploy a strobe light to mark their position; it would create a beacon for the NVA too as it flashed through the low clouds, he screamed back when asked to do so by his six, the lieutenant in charge of the LRRP platoon. It seemed perfectly obvious to us in the bleachers that the NVA knew precisely where they were. It was obvious to us too that the team leader was losing it, losing his ability to lead, and to survive - but remember, he was there, Joe and I were not. Anything I say about the LRRP leader is not criticism or relevant. I only know what I heard that evening. It  remains in my mind that the team leader did lose it however.   Within a few minutes there were two KIA on the team and all except one wounded; a grenade had found its mark. About then a screaming match developed between the team leader and a Major, probably the Brigade S-2 at the nearby TOC; I never knew. The Major had come up on the net demanding that the team leader ‚Äúput his shit in order goddammit! We can‚Äôt help you if you don‚Äôt give us your location.‚Äù   The team leader‚Äôs response got strange as he went off on the Major in no uncertain terms, cursing him and reminding him that, ‚ÄúYou fucking promised me you‚Äôd get us out, you motherfucker!‚Äù  It seemed that the two of them were picking up the thread of a private conversation they once had. It was plain to hear that the Major‚Äôs concern was real, he wanted to help, he wanted to pull them out and was equally plain that the option was fading fast. The NVA were closing the door and maneuvering for the kill, a point not lost on the team leader.  Joe and I shared a quick glance and we heard the team leader‚Äôs voice give into what could only be called barely controlled panic, ‚ÄúI hear the little bastard‚Äôs! ‚ÄúTHEY‚ÄôRE COMING IN ‚Ä¶ FUCKING GOOKS ARE ALL AROUND US‚Ä¶‚Äù  AK fire, much closer now as the mike keyed off.  ‚ÄúGoddamn you, Major! You said you‚Äôd come to get us‚Ä¶GET THAT FUCKER, GET HIM!‚Äù  Sounds of an M-16 firing; ‚Ä¶ the transmission stops. Joe and I know what‚Äôs going to happen now, the inevitable.  ‚ÄúAHHH SHIT, AH SHIT! YOU MOTHERFUCKER, GODDAMN YOU MAJOR, GODDAMN YOU‚Ä¶I‚ÄôM HIT‚Ä¶‚Äù  The M-16 again, very loud AK fire; excited Asian voices‚Ä¶ an AK burst, then silence.  And then the long string of unanswered calls from LRRP Control until we both removed our headsets.  There was silence between us in the close confines of the van and in the red glow of the light from the radio dials; the sounds of us exiting, lighting cigarettes in the damp night, not saying a word for a long time. My mind‚Äôs eye filled with NVA searching through the fresh blood of their victory - out there - in the rain.   FINI Copyright 1999"

Some of Third Squad were out doing Engineer stuff.  I was at our house in the compound.  Little tiny house.   ""Third's been hit.""  From one of our guys, letting everyone know.  You know that look on somebody's face, the way your stomach feels like it's going to just fall on the floor.  He told us everything by his body language.  The words were extraneous.  Everyone who wasn't on guard duty or out doing something piled into our radio room.  The family was there.  In the daytime Radio Watch had it on speakers instead of a head set.  Everyone straining to listen.  I can't remember any of the transmissions, just Casualties and Requesting MEDEVAC.  I remember standing at the back of the room, listening to my heart pounding, my mouth drying up.  You could have probably heard all of our hearts.    The Gook was out there, and Dirty, and West Virginia.  I started shaking, shaking, and that was the first time I ever actually wanted to murder people.  The Platoon Sergeant told us to get over to Charlie Company's compound where our boys had limped their two trucks after getting hit.  Alpha Company Grunts were sending a couple of trucks over.  I got to tag along, probably because the Gook and I were tight.    We got there, I wanted to shoot every Iraqi I saw along the way, and I jumped out of the Nissan pickup.  There was an FLA there, and Medics.  I saw our Nissan and our five-ton.  I saw the Gook, he was smoking a cigarette.  He was white as death, he was shaking as bad as I was.  I ran over to him and hugged him.  We held each other for a minute.  I was chain smoking, too.  ""Who the fuck else is hit?""  Not wanting the answer.  ""They're okay.  Fuck.  I thought Dirty was gonna die!""  ""It's good to see you, man!""  That's where the laughter starts.  I climbed up into the five-ton, and looked at the golf ball sized hole in the windshield on the TC side, right at head level, and the three ragged holes in the back of the cab.  The gook was looking at me, and I couldn't believe he wasn't dead.  ""How the fuck...""  ""I couldn't hear my i-Com, so I leaned down...that's when it went off.

MilitaryStories,2e1xya,SoThereIwas-NoShit,6,Wed Aug 20 04:33:18 2014 UTC,"Okay, I went back and re-read all five parts. Thanks for putting all the music in there. Makes more sense to me. I let it play as I read.  Gratuitous (or is it?) side story: I remember an operation with the ARVNs in Vietnam that had a lot of rain. For one reason or another, I ran through all my dry socks, so I hung them on my ruck and went sockless. I was hot, wet and perilously close to trenchfoot when suddenly, there was a pagoda. It was abandoned, but it had a good roof. It was mostly porch - no walls, kind of a decorative roof, and pillars everywhere that were set just far enough apart to accommodate hammocks. There was an inner chapel-like area. Tile floor. Plus some outbuildings. Did I mention the roof? It was fully functional.  Our commander, the Thi√™u t√° (Major), decided to set up for a couple of days. I got barefoot and let my feet dry out. My socks too. Was wonderful. This unexpected pagoda in the middle of the jungle refreshed us all, healed us all. For the moment. A pagoda. Coulda been just a nice house or something. But it was a fuckin' pagoda. A pretty one too. I would never have the nerve to make something like that up and write it down. So there is some difference between me and the gods. Gods don't give a shit about words like ""trite"" and ""obvious"" and ""literal.""  Since that time, anything like that in my life is a ""pagoda."" I taught my daughters about the idea, but I did not think it was possible to convey the sheer human misery of being wet and trench-footed and tired and hot and played out so much that a metaphorical pagoda could even happen to them - how something that might not matter much in normal circumstances can take on aspects of soul-salvation. It took a tour with the IDF for one, and a year in the bush in Mali for the other, before they understood the term.   I did not think it was possible to convey that feeling - sudden unexpected relief from misery, a respite, a hiatus, a moment of relief that goes as deep as your misery, mines it, mills it and turns it to gold - until now. Grinder, you are like the mills of the gods - you grind slow, but exceedingly fine. I felt every rotten, unhappy, miserable part of this story - which is the precursor to understanding a pagoda-moment. There were several, but the goat dinner - It was goat! It was great! - got a fist-pump from me. Yeah! Pa-fucking-goda!  Didn't think it was possible to write that. There is not anyone reading here who doesn't hurt for you. Writing that took some grit. Good for you. Bad for you, too. But mostly good. Get it out in the open. Make it real. Turn and face it down. Own it.   Maybe it'll kill you. Maybe it'll just salt you. Your choice. But if I have a say, I vote for the latter. Seriously, man, your stuff is Proust-in-hell. The New York Times book reviewer will soil his pants.

He tried to talk me out of it.  There was no endless war going on, then.  I still knew way more than he did.  I'm trying to steer these dumbasses to at least get what they think they want out of the military.  Offered to go talk to their recruiters with them, make sure the contract is what they actually want.  Granted, they have to finish Senior Year, or at least be close, before contracts will be manifest.  The shit they tell me they're being offered doesn't jive with reality.  I'd tell them to do anything but be in the military, but they wouldn't listen.

With you on the chair next to you, remembering the fucking hemorrhoid promoting starfish punches that only a seat of that caliber can elicit. A little purgatory of cacophony, swirling with bad humors and other incidentally sadistic cost cutting compromise that the army thought was just good enough for us to survive and at the right cost.   Thinking well, the fuck did we do this all for if it was all for naught. Knowing good and well some shiny stared fucktard had a brilliant masterplan. And that others higher on the scrotum pole had charts: INT vs. RA for the AO vs. AVM (asset value to mission) vs. what the hell other things those echelons with secret handshake, special rings, and a cold bean counter methodology that didn't give a shit about trees thought of the forest.  The fuckall you get when you realize that you following orders was going to mean people you have come to know, broke bread with, possibly bled with or had harbor with (or a pag-o-da as AM put it so beautifully) were going to get the high hard one to the 6.

I've seen lots of people fuck up with alcohol. I've done it myself.  But I've had one sailor who fucked up his life with drugs. There's a lot more to it, but he had been taking meth and amphetamines. By the time we figured it out, he want anything close to the gun maintainer that he had been. He was just so different by the end of it. Not the same person at all. He went AWOL when he got issued his NTSC. They never picked him up, so no idea what's going on with him now.  That's one of the times that I really wished that either I or someone else had picked up on the problem a lot sooner. Nothing I could have done at the time, but I kick myself over it.  And on a purely practical level, there would have to be a lot of effort put into standardisation and regulation of drug production and sales before there could be a snowflakes hope in hell of drugs being permitted for serving personnel. The effects, and the length of the effects, are just far too unpredictable. A ship is a safety critical area for a reason. I don't want anybody working in my machinery spaces who may be impaired in any way at all. Hell, these days we can stand people down for being sleep deprived."

MilitaryStories,2doy2q,snimrass,11,Sat Aug 16 02:54:43 2014 UTC,"Continued from OP.  The villagers riot  Towards the end of the second week, there was a group leader who had heard all about our exploits and the hoops we had made some of the groups jump through to achieve a result. He did not want to put up with our bullshit, and therefore did not want to negotiate at all. Came straight in demanding that we handed all the food over to the Australian personnel.  This did not go down well with the chief, or with his unruly hoard villagers. And so we rioted.  And it escalated quickly. We started yelling and getting up in their faces, trying to force them off our village land and back onto the road. When they tried to take the food, we sat on the crates. They got more and more aggro with us - yelling back, then weapons raised, then weapons cocked (at this stage, the supervising staff told us to back off - the trainees had an RoE that would let them fire if threatened, but no situation in the exercise should have pushed them to that point - it shouldn't have even got to the stage of cocking weapons). We ended up getting pulled off the crates, and dragged out of the way. Once that had happened, there was not much we could do other than keep yelling and waving fists at them as they walked off with our food.  Pretty sure the kid still passed his assessment, because the purpose of the scenario was more to get him to do something while maintaining control of the personnel in his section, rather than making sure it was absolutely the right course of action to take. We were all pretty unimpressed with that kid though - he was a hot-headed little army bugger who thought he was king shit and had all the answers. It showed.  So it turns out that the inherent group loyalty that makes a unit tick is there even when you're pretending to be a group of difficult and quarrelsome villagers. We were pissed off at that little shit for the rest of the day - the foreign interlopers had to be repelled from our land, and the insults against our revered chief made right! There was a lesson for us in there too - we had no real connection to each other or to the footprint of our makeshift village, and we had been approaching the scenario with sense of humour. Well, we had been, right up until the point that it turned into anger. Here we are getting our backs up at the ""foreigners"", the interlopers coming in to our place to mess with our affairs. That was something to file away, particularly as a pretty inexperienced officer. A lesson to be learned, without the need for catastrophic consequences, on what can happen when you're on someone else's land, just trying to do the right thing, and you end up dealing with seemingly ungrateful people in shitty circumstances.  The rest of the time was some damn good fun - actually, it was some of the best fun I had before I graduated and had to start being a real officer (despite the fact that I ended up with an absolutely disgraceful boot and sleeve tan).  As an aside, this exercise added evidence to my theory that while the military may be short on actually women, there are no shortage of men who are not just willing but actually quite keen to dress up as girls. I was the only chick in the group of villagers, so the lone female in the outcast village group was a bloke wearing a sarong and towel on his head for hair. I reckon the cross-dressing alone ensured that he had more fun than the rest of us."
MilitaryStories,2doy2q,AnathemaMaranatha,10,Sat Aug 16 02:55:13 2014 UTC,"Lessons learned, get learned over and over again. The guy really snorted the magic mushrooms? ROTFLMAO. Do NOT take food from your friends and allies - Marines included - especially when it is eagerly offered, Always remember that though you are a professional soldier here to help, at some cultural level, you are hilarious.   He did not want to put up with our bullshit, and therefore did not want to negotiate at all. Came straight in demanding that we handed all the food over to the Australian personnel.   Oh it just HAD to be an Army guy. US Army guys got no negotiating skills.. As for the Aussie Army... well, it's not an accident that when you google √öc √∞ai l√≤‚Äôi, you get this.  Good story, OP. Funny. Can't do better'n that.  Maybe a little too funny... It's always good to get female perspective, but honestly, this is just disturbing:   As an aside, this exercise added evidence to my theory that while the military may be short on actually women, there are no shortage of men who are not just willing but actually quite keen to dress up as girls.   I have shared a barracks with a variety of males, and I have to say I can't disagree. I think it's not a gay thing or a transvestite thing. I think it's an artifact doppelganger of the military's desire to look and act tough. It generates a non-sexual desire to sometimes just look FABULOUS!!!   Creeps me out a little. My bad. And I'm wrong too. Lack of actual females created a military necessity. If you gotta play the girl, then play the best girl you can! Oooorah."

It would have been surprising if it hadn't happened - a bunch of young adults crammed together in one place with money to burn and comparatively few responsibilities? What do you think is going to happen?  The first of these parties that I attended had a Wild West theme. The finest cowgirl to be seen that night was a 6'5"" army bloke, who was built like a brick shithouse thanks to many years of rowing. He went the whole hog  - blonde wig in pigtails, a full face of makeup, plaid shirt tied in a little bow at the front, denim miniskirt. He even shaved his legs.  And that is where us biological ladies had the last laugh - we told him that he needed to moisturise after shaving. Apparently that was a bridge too far into femininity, because he didn't do it, and then spent the next few days horribly confused as to how it could be so itchy as the hair started to regrow.  That was far from the last time that I saw a bloke rocking a skirt. The night of huge bearded Bavarian beermaids will not soon be forgotten ....

MilitaryStories,2dhki2,FeastOfChildren,7,Thu Aug 14 10:36:30 2014 UTC,"Holy shit, that was an excellent read.    You definitely channelled Tom Clancy in that story by the facts:  a) awesome level of detail and great explanation and  b) that you got an arty dude fascinated in bulk fuel (is bulk fuel the correct word for aviation fuel?).  What was the aftermath?  I mean in terms of Safety Officers and the guys in the tent that narrowly avoided serious injuries or death.  Also, why are jumps from the HEMTTs so serious?  They always look relatively small to me (compared to 7-tons).  Thanks in advance brother."
MilitaryStories,2dhki2,TylerDurdenisreal,6,Thu Aug 14 03:16:20 2014 UTC,IIRC most HEMTT variants are right around ten feet tall. A ten foot jump will fuck you up if doesn't go perfectly.
MilitaryStories,2dhki2,Meihem76,7,Thu Aug 14 04:09:04 2014 UTC,"Bulk fuel is any quantity in excess of 499 gallons. The aftermath was a LOT of coffee-wielding safety officers walking around in their best, ""I'm important,"" postures. The Soldiers inside the tent were none the wiser until well after the danger had passed.  As for the HEMTT jumps, I can't only come up with a few contributing factors for the cause of injuries. You compared it to a 7-ton, which is 98 inches tall to the ring mount -- an M978 is 112 inches. That's just over a foot taller than the MTVR. That being said, I don't think that is the main cause of dismount-related injuries. When jumping from a 7-ton (which we never, ever do... right?), is a straight down jump. The HEMTT tanker has beveled edges on the tank. This causes the jumper to have significantly more lateral movement in the action. Any thoughts?"

I arrived in country eight days later. Things were still messed up.  Greetings and props to your Dad. You should be proud. Hell, I'm proud, and I don't even know him. That citation should have been a Silver Star - would've been, if he'd had more rank. I'm guessing BSM-V. Anytime you see a PFC with a BSM-V, you know he busted ass for it. On a PFC, that's twice the same decoration on a Colonel. Easily.   You wish my dad was yours.   Yeah, a little. But no. At OCS in Fort Sill, they made the candidates call ""Company, Attention!"" when a company grade officer came on the quad. Every candidate had to freeze at attention while the guy who called ""Attention!"" saluted the officer. This kept officers from being saluted to death as they crossed Robinson Barracks.  If a field grade officer showed up, you were supposed to call ""Battalion, Attention!"", though it only applied to the people who could hear you.  At graduation, my Dad (who had retired about six months earlier) got permission to wear his Air Force uniform, eagles and all. He wasn't the graduation speaker, but I got to call ""Brigade, Attention!"" Was fun. I was never sure Dad understood why.  Miss him. He'd be proud of your Dad too, OP."

I've met Private Erwin before; not your version but his reincarnation (if one is inclined to believe in it) so to speak. It was 40 years later back in 2007, when good old Knights-of-Ni was a young PFC in Basic Training. My Private Erwin was the smartest dumb man I've ever met. You could tell the gears in his head were moving but only certain ones. Private Erwin had a thick southern accent which didn't help his situation. He wasn't a favorite of the Drill Sergeants but seeing that it was 2007; he got pushed through as well. If you gave him a complex math equation, he could easily do it in his head. Anything else....well, that wasn't his cup of tea. This is also the same soldier who I had to help tie his shoes in Basic Training. Yes, I had to show a soldier how to tie his shoes. Definitely not the finest soldier the US Arm has ever produced but this was 2007. Iraq was on the verge of a civil war and we were also doing operations in Afghanistan so we needed warm bodies and he filled that requirement. He went off the school house to fix computers and I haven't seen him since but I can still never forget Private Erwin. I'm certain that there were Private Erwins in the Continental Army as they crossed the Delaware River and there will continue to be Private Erwins in the future as they battle non-beret wearing Robots. Here's to you, Private Erwin, wherever you are."

MilitaryStories,2ddep8,djabelek,5,Tue Aug 12 23:06:09 2014 UTC,"Basically the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that things move with a place and a momentum, thus making a trail. You can either look at location or momentum. Every time you look at either, you shoot eye bullets that change what your looking at, making the trail change. The harder you look, the more it changes. So basically when they looked they changed his trail. But he knew where their destination was but not their path, but it lessened the probabilities. When they did the same, it didn't lessen possibilities because he could have bounce anywhere since he didn't have a target, but they did."

She was in maintenance up in Brisbane. No casualties, thankfully, but shows just how bad fire can be for a ship. Much worse than flooding.  Navy version. Hmm. Probably very similar to what army guys do when the can't play with fire - stand around and talk shit, possibly while smoking. Depending on how long it has been/will be to the next port visit, there can be a lot of drinking stories, and exaggerated tales of who fucked whom. Other than that, just the standard shit. Gossip and such. Drawing dicks on things. Oh, and finding creatively competitive ways to inflict pain on other people, generally involving hitting other guys in the balls if possible."

The Russian women were really out of place there though, and were the ones that seemed really sad. Weird situation with them. That was one of the bars said to be owned by the Russian Mafia, and in that country the rumours were probably true. Now I've seen a lot of the shit on Walking Street, not sure I have any need to go again. It's a fucked up sort of place.  And young men are still horny idiots who will risk a lot to get their dick in. Our boys were talking about the shit they got up to for days after that port visit. Some got themselves in a lot more trouble than others - local cops there run scams on the young white boy tourists, and one of my sailors got himself caught up in it.

I don't know how people stood it. There was one time my company was PZ'ed out of the bush back to a big base at Phuc Vinh (Binh?). There was some sort of big attack brewing, and we were needed as a reaction force.  They parked us in an open field. CO told us to drop heavies, but sleep with an eye to getting up and going someplace fast. Keep your battle gear about you, use your ruck as a bed, your helmet web as a pillow. No rain flies, no unpacking, keep your boots on.  So we sat there and watched the show. Pop flares from the perimeter bunkers, illum rounds outside the perimeter, recons by fire from the dusters and quad 50s, random artillery H&I fires. They even had a spooky - a C47 - hosing down the woods with its gatlin guns, streams of tracers followed by a buzz sound. Spooky was dropping flares too.  Was kind of a nice night - no rain. We were inside a perimeter. We could listen to AFVN if we wanted, talk out loud, read a book by flashlight, and watch crazy, tense, people run from here to there looking worried. No perimeter watch, no claymores out. There was a nice latrine and piss tube just over there.  Most of the grunts dossed out early. Me too. Nothing happened. Was a nice night. We enjoyed it.  Nobody else seemed to have a good time. Seriously, what is wrong with REMF folks? They don't seem to know when to relax.  This would be a story-bomb, if there was any story to it.

If nothing else, at my age it's an effort.  Even so, stories beget stories. One of the things I've re-discovered here on /r/MilitaryStories  is how bad my memory is, and how much I've forgotten. Mostly, OP, you remind me of the day-to-day business of living outside - small things - the feel of bamboo leaf turf under my jungle hammock, the cool of the morning, the heat, the mosquitoes who go for your elbow and three inches up toward your shoulder 'cause that skin is just hanging there and you're not paying attention... I've forgotten the physical memory of things. Not you. Not yet.  Which is why I like your writing style, OP. All that alive-in-the-world stuff goes in, even to the point where the the action scenes seem to fade into the background. That's how I remember it too - a real and immediate 24/7 interface with the environment around me. Made me feel more alive - all that world around me with me in it. Rain on me. Bugs on me. Find some place to shit. Can't get away from it all, can't wall it off. I was part of that, I was living there impacting and being impacted by all that life.   Makes the indoor, comfy, convenient, muffled, screen-staring daily life back in the world seem like being asleep while wrapped in styrofoam. Makes me feel less alive. Stopped having breakfast with my death. Might be a mistake. I think its creeping around here somewhere. Sneaks up on me while I'm watching TV.  So thank you for that. Well written.

If I'm not mistaken, standing orders are to run towards any unexpected firing until someone tells you ""never mind."" The first senior NCO or officer to arrive has the duty to either count the enemy bodies OR to chew everyone out for finally having some fun. All weapons fun is, by definition, too much fun. Can't have that.  I can understand your squad leader's problem: it's just a matter of efficiency. If everyone shoots, then everyone is in trouble for the same thing. If some shoot and some don't shoot, she has to chew on them for two different offenses - shooting and not joining in the shooting. It's inefficient. Efficiency is a German thing, right?

Once you've seen 3 of those things flying in a line in a valley (holler around here) that looks like it's too steep sided to fly an RC plane through, you believe.

Some sailors in the fleet do that too, to avoid sailing. You still treat it with all due care, take it all seriously and follow through on all the precautions whenever threats are made - but I've also had to deal with guys who are actually suicidal. You can tell the difference - it's as clear as day."

We new there was a cat in the area, so I brought a sidearm.   My job was to make a bunch of noise and bust through the brush.  They were walking an inverted wedge on either side.  There was a light drizzle.  I smelled something funky, and then it hit me.  All of a sudden I thought, 'Fuck!  Stinks like...Cat...Piss.  Oh. Shit.'  The dog was acting weird, I had my .40 out, and sure as shit, as I'm looking around, I see a little rock overhang with a big dry spot under it.

We were walking along this hill side where you can either fall about 100' down on your right or have to scatter up a hill to your left. We were all armed, all talking shit like a bunch of hard asses. All the way up until we got fucking hissed at from a tree to our right that was easily 150' in the air.  We didn't see shit.

MilitaryStories,2c09ry,AnathemaMaranatha,7,Wed Jul 30 03:00:02 2014 UTC,"First of all, fun story. Thanks. But you hit some of my buttons there. I‚Äôm gonna take time out from building Noah‚Äôs Ark 2, and story-bomb your OP with some questions.   He wanted it ready to go, so after doing our test burns on our time-fuse we crimped and primed a sixty second fuse. He wanted ten seconds. We said no.   ‚ÄúCrimped and primed.‚Äù I‚Äôve heard that before. I have no idea what it means.  I‚Äôm gonna tell you what saw, OP, and then maybe you can tell me what happened.  I‚Äôve seen combat film of satchel charges from WWII. Some guy essayons his way up to the side of a bunker holding what looks like an Army briefcase with a sling. He does something with it while standing to one side of the bunker‚Äôs gunport, then grabs the sling and flings the satchel inside. Whereupon after a small amount of time - not enough for someone inside the bunker to pick up the satchel charge and throw it back out through the gunport - kablooey.  Not my war experience. Enemy sappers were known as ‚Äúzappers‚Äù in Vietnam. They were reputed to be crazy or hopped up or both. Here‚Äôs what I saw:  We were on a hilltop LZ in mountain jungle in the middle of an empty NVA basecamp. It was an ARVN firebase occupied by two companies of infantry and an ARVN 105 mm artillery battery. There had been a disagreement about perimeter defense on the first day the arty arrived. The infantry commander was of the opinion that the artillery battery should be responsible for one-quarter of the perimeter, and the artillery commander thought perimeter duty was beneath the dignity of the artillery. Words were exchanged - both commanders were completely unwilling to lose ‚Äúface‚Äù, and consequently both commanders ceased to speak to each other.   So to save face of the officers, the perimeter closest to the guns was left unguarded. I mean all we had was a couple of rolls of concertina wire. That was all that was between the guns and the jungle.  We were fortunate the NVA who built the place died at Hue. Even so they had a cadre. Apparently they sent out for zappers.  One night at about midnight there was shooting from the perimeter and these guys came through the wire - no weapons, no shirt, no helmets. Just shorts, sandals and a kind of sling bag with lumpy objects in it.  I saw the lumps later. They were about cantaloupe-sized pieces of what looked like Chicom or Russian C4 with some wires and a D battery stuck in it. I was told they squeezed it and threw them. There was some kind of delay device. These weren‚Äôt suicide bombers.   They came in at a flat run - about seven or eight of them. They took out all the guns and the FDC tent. I was told that three of them tossed a couple of charges, then just exploded. Apparently falling down with a sack of squeezable bombs is contraindicated.   By the time they had made a mess of our artillery battery, the two companies of ARVN infantry were on line and coming over the top of the hill. They didn‚Äôt take any chances - no prisoners. They exploded a couple more bodies in the morning. I think the rest of them just went back to the jungle.  I‚Äôve been wondering about this for decades. That was my first (but not last) encounter with zappers. Memorable night. I emptied my .45 at one guy before I hit him once. He fell over backwards, then got up like it was nothing. I could see where I had hit him in his shoulder.   That was the night I decided that the .45 M1911A1 was not as advertised. I was very disappointed to see him get back up, especially since I had no more bullets. I thought about writing a nasty letter to Colt Firearms. Took a friend with an M16 to seal the deal.  I always wondered what drugs they were using, if they even were using drugs. But I also wonder if those exploding cantaloupes were just jerry-rigged satchel charges? How are they ‚Äúcrimped and primed?‚Äù Would bumping into things and falling down set those things off? How fucking crazy do you have to be to run around carrying a bag of those things?  Nothing personal in that last question. I‚Äôm sure they trained you well in how to safely carry a bag of boom, even if that seems like a batshit crazy thing to do. To some of us. No offense."
MilitaryStories,2c09ry,mrtomhimself,4,Tue Jul 29 21:58:35 2014 UTC,"Jesus.  That's a pretty brick shitting recollection.  No idea what they were doing.  Sounds dangerous.  ""Crimped and primed"", now that I think about it, was probably pretty specific to us.  I'll have to go into a little history for it to make sense.  During all of our training, from AIT and on into demo ranges at Bragg, we used and were expected to know MDI.  That's Modernized Demolition Initiators.  Shock tube, hollow tube in 500' and 1000' rolls.  Low density blasting caps.  High density blasting density blasting caps on 30' shock tube.  These things replaced electrical initiation systems.  Time fuse is pretty much time fuse.  The new shit, at the time, came in ""five minute"" sections with a high density cap pre-crimped.    When we first drew demo in Ar Ar, none of it was MDI.  The old style time fuse came in five hundred foot rolls.  You cut off what you want.  Blasting caps came ten to a can.  We never used anything but time fuse while we were there.  ""Crimped and primed"" meant a blasting cap was crimped onto time fuse, and the blasting cap was in the C4.  It meant ready to go.  For us ""popping smoke"" meant igniting, because the time fuse is powered by black powder, and really smoky, especially since it's burning the plastic outer layers.  If you hear an engineer say he's ""got smoke"", get cover.  Thinking about it more, we probably primed his satchel with det-cord, and gave him his crimped section of time fuse separate.  Caps and demo should generally not be together until you need boom.  I always carried a quarter block on my vest, and a cap with ten seconds of time fuse as a master key, in case I needed an exit I didn't know I needed.  I was still always more uncomfortable with frags.  Also, a satchel charge is a glorified way of saying ""a bag with explosives in it""."
MilitaryStories,2c09ry,Telefrag_Ent,4,Wed Jul 30 01:11:57 2014 UTC,"Sounds dangerous.   Made me laugh. Yeah, I think so.  Well nuts. I saw the cantaloupe bombs in the dark. They were all covered with tape with some plastic explosive peeking through. I saw wires, and what looked like a D battery (maybe not). We were not touching them. My boss didn't want me even to get close. I guess I'll never know how the things worked - were supposed to work. Three zappers exploded. Three out of six or eight. I detect a design flaw, but I guess I'll never know.  Some engineers showed up in the early morning and blew the cantaloupes up in situ - bodies too if they were close. What you said - I think they were dangerous. Then they spent the rest of the day rounding up artillery rounds, burning powder, salvaging brass and projos.  I totally agree on grenades. I never tossed a frag, but about three out of ten smoke grenades I tossed came back and landed at my feet. Bamboo is springy - tosses things right back to you. Totally put me off frags. Bad enough to have the WP grenades.   Thanks for the info. Reminded me of the grunts blowing LZ's in thick bush. Blasting caps and det cord. I never learned how to do that.  Since you're a hippie now, you may enjoy this:  When I got back I went straight to Colorado University, which was trying it's best to be Berkeley Lite. The Revolution was in full swing - peace, love, dove, kill the pigs. SDS had been laughed off campus the year before for some dumbshit thing. All the ex-SDSers were now in the SMC - the Student Moratorium Committee - which had handed an ultimatum to the CU Administration that they must (a) cease allowing ROTC on campus, (b) cease all DoD contracting and research, and (c) end the war. If they didn't do all of those things, there would be consequences.  I was moderately interested. I shuffled up to one organizational meeting where ""consequences"" would be decided upon by consensus - not some bourgeois fascist thing like a vote. So everyone spoke. The organizers were hot to do some office invasions. One of the guys in front mentioned that he could get some super-secret military explosive that only blew inward! So they could occupy the offices and destroy University files without actually harming anyone or anything else! He said it was a cord, and you could just wrap it around a file.  I couldn't keep quiet. I know now I should have. But no. ""Uh... what you're talking about is called det-cord, and it definitely blows outward. You don't want to be in the room.""  I was immediately denounced as a CIA spy, and asked to leave. Kind of flattering, now that I look back on it."

I can't really say too much about it, because we never met any enemy in the times I was involved.  The very last time I did it was in Afghanistan, and I can tell you honestly that at the time my blood was up and I was really hoping to kill some motherfuckers, and didn't care about anything else.  Other than that, it was just duty and responsibility.  They were both low intensity conflicts compared to the way I understand Vietnam, or at least my little slice of pie in them was."

MilitaryStories,2bglm8,snimrass,4,Fri Jul 25 22:35:48 2014 UTC,It was good because we were hungry as hell and it fed the whole squad so a fair number of people. I dressed it with a machete I kept in my kit and a combat knife for the more fiddly bits of work like skinning. As to what it was like? Horse is the closest comparison I can make but it was even more gamey. Toss cubes in a pot with veggies and date wine cadged from stuff we found in an abandoned house and you have some damn fine stew though.

He said they were basically doing a whole lot of nothing, but were doing that whole lot of nothing on Saddam's game reserve.  He said they shot gazelle or antelope.  Him being one of the guys, they had a few dudes who knew how to field dress game, and he said that was one of his favorite parts of the deployment."

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are beyond my comprehension. I can't imagine how we've made the world a better place after all of it. I was pissed after 9/11, but I figured we'd gather intel and send in some shadows to fuck up Bin Laden, not invade a country, and then another one.

I've thought of joining since childhood, so waiting to educate myself about the reality of it all seemed prudent. I've tried to stay away from civilians opinions, because they don't know.

Before the west invaded my little island,their was a hierarchy that provided equality to all.Even women.The kings were always from the bigger race and religion so the majority would follow the king. After a massive invasion by the Southern Indians about 700 years ago,Tamil/Hindu culture started to integrate in the major race culture and religion.The last king of Sri Lanka was Tamil and the country was ok with it. After the English invaded,they started giving out the major positions of power to the minorities in order to control the majority.Which eventually made the majority annoyed.In the late 1800 and early 1900 the English imported 1-1.5-million Indian coolies because the singhalese(majority race)refused to work for the British empire.These Indian coolies were brought into sustain the coffee/tea/rubber which was the countries export crops. After gaining freedom in 1948,the majority of the free government were singhalese.As the new country tried to build itself up,tensions started to rise between the races.The British always used the races to fight each other and after a century of discontent,it was running very high.In the 1960s the country ran into a draught which disabled the governments ability to build up the momentum.Then in 1971 there was a communist riot which led to most of the university graduates spending their time in reeducation camps.The entire country was in  disarray. Different racers started vying for power as they were being throttled due to the government focusing on maintaining its power.The minority races usually lived to the northeast and north and the middle of the country,a bit far away from the two major cities. Lack of power and essentials was the reason a Tamil para military groups were formed who were challeging the gov for reform.A group called LTTE,received funding from Tamil Nadu government to arm and train itself and became the major danger for the government in the brother provinces. I will continue after work"

I'm a sucker for the wall-jumping, door-kicking stories the same as everyone else here, but that last paragraph was a very peaceful, kind of beautiful image. A nice counterpoint to the rest of the story too, but definitely a worthwhile moment in its own right."
MilitaryStories,2bd4ip,snimrass,2,Wed Jul 23 05:08:26 2014 UTC,"There were a lot of moments like that.  We were all just people with jobs to do.  You know that.  You deal with the same things, like the young couple and the girl with the BC in her bag.  Somebody who got off on having power would have made a point of making it a point, but you didn't have to and treated her like a person, with respect.  As for the cow shit, that stuff was fermenting and rancid.  It was nasty."
MilitaryStories,2bd4ip,snimrass,4,Thu Jul 24 02:15:19 2014 UTC,"Took me a moment to catch up - thought that comment about the girl would have been buried. Yeah, I get that you're doing the job. And I understand what you are saying about respect. When the power balance is skewed that much, there has to be respect.  However, wasn't actually implying that you were doing something amazing by being polite where possible - I've read enough of your stuff here to figure that you're not a prick. The comment about the beauty of it was actually aimed at the landscape image. One of those early morning farm scenes that photographers would probably love. National Geographic would be all over that shit.  The other side of the initial comment is that you are just very good at writing and at framing a story. Everyone says it, so you know it and I'm guessing it gets boring hearing it over and over, but you're a damn good writer.  I'm waiting for AnathemaMaranatha to chime in on this. I would put money on him having a Vietnam era version of that moment in the final paragraph. Guess he's still dealing with the rain."

Best thing about going to sea? Dolphins. They are awesome. Never seen anything that just seems so damn happy to be alive. I don't think I knew a single person onboard who didn't like seeing dolphins around. Saw some pretty damn nice sunsets too, but you can get sunsets anywhere.

MilitaryStories,2bd4ip,snimrass,6,Sat Jul 26 05:24:59 2014 UTC,"Nice. Still rainin'. Just had to say. I like people being people. Nice you could see that, OP.  Funny how things come up in odd places. Here OP is busting into people's houses through their outhouses. In my war, rice paddies and estuaries doubled as the local sewage system, and they were boot-suckers too. After hot, sunshiny morning of muck where I had to fish both boots out of deep quivering muck, the radio started making fizzle squark! noises. We were inside an ARVN perimenter in a ville. An old man in black pajamas was squatting there watching us as we squished and oozed goo and tried to make the radio work.  I was hot and sweaty, black mud from the hips down and totally pissed at our PRC-25 which had somehow accumulated about a gallon of water inside it. When dumping out the water didn't cure it, my RTO and I had a temper tantrum because it was hot and steamy and everything in the rice paddy smelled like shit and the fuckin' radio didn't work and we needed the fuckin' radio to work, so we decided to yell at it.   ""Fuckin' fucker's fucked up! What the fuck? What kind of fucked up fucker makes a radio that they fuckin' *know** is gonna be used in the fuckin' jungle and doesn't make it fuckin' watertight for a couple of trips through the fuckin' estuary shitholes? Fuck. Fuck that shit right there. Oughtta toss the fucker in the fuckin' rice paddy with the water buffalo shit...  I've never been good at yelling - kind of a one-trick pony - but I was doing my best.   When we paused for breath, the old man stood up and said - in perfect, modulated, BBC English - ""If you do bury it in the rice paddy, please be kind enough to tell me where.""  What? Pappa-san had just turned into Edward R. Murrow. Our polite subroutines just kicked in. We both said things like, ""Yes sir. Sure. Sorry, sir. Don't think we can really throw it away. But if we do, we'll be sure to tell you."" He smiled and thanked us and walked away.  Now I'm sure /u/Dittybopper will jump in here and tell me that was the VC kingpin trying to get my radio, and y'know he could be right. Seems likely. But he was nice, so we were nice. If wars were fought with niceness - We are prepared to saturate the area with M1088 one-kiloton compliments, unless you surrender immediately! - it would be a better world, and young men would have the time to develop creative cussin' skills properly.  Good story, OP. It made me all happy and chatty.   Back to the sandbags. More coming tomorrow."

My God, how many /r/Military threads are there that sing the praises of various DIs who make verbal abuse and the calumnious virtues of the English language dance like Astaire and Rogers.  Here I had an audience who had learned his English listening to the best of English vulgarity via the BBC! Epic fail.  Consider this exchange from Othello where Iago anonymously informs a Venetian Senator from the morning shadows of the streets that his daughter has eloped with a man of dignity and, alas, too much compexion. Iago's news is not appreciated by the Senator.   IAGO:  'Zounds sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you.  Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you. . .

Your treatment of the BRT would be a good illustration as to why my type of engineer is not trusted near electronic goods. We resort to that type of action far too often. Great with anything that can be fixed with WD40 or gaffa tape though.  However, after trying the ONOFF switch, percussive maintenance often really does work. Wouldn't be able to tell you why, but when you really need that piece of kit no one gives a crap how it got fixed. Just awkward when it breaks again and this time hitting it doesn't work.

You were required to do two water jumps. In any case the drill was to inflate the vest at about 200 foot after you were sure you'd land in the water and then turn downwind so the chute continues over your head and lands away from you when you enter the water, this is so you won't have it and the lines tangle you up and drown you. I exit the aircraft at 1200 feet making a static line jump wearing just a military style parachute rig and shorts. When the chute opened I lined up on the lake and determined that I'd land in it, turning downwind as required. I waited, then unhooked my reserve chute on one side and unhooked the chest strap and loosened one leg strap, all proper preparation for a water landing back then. I then inflated the vest, all good. You are supposed to lock your arms in front of you and around the vest immediately before hitting the water, I do, I slam down and plunge below the surface and the vest explodes from the sudden pressure increase. Damn. Instead of popping to the surface I crawl to the surface and clear of the chute and the safety boat is immediately right there to pick me up, just as planned."

I have a few mild stories from the last few generations of my family, but one of my great grandfathers was a RKKA paratrooper, and actually rubbed elbows at one period with Vasiliy Filipovich Margelov (the unofficial ""founder"" of the VDV), but unfortunately he was the type of veteran that didn't like to talk about it much. He died from complications from a shrapnel wound he sustained during the war (old age had quite a bit to do with it too, but the guy could still pick me up and throw me around when I was a kid and he was in his late 70s/early 80s.), I only have vague memories of him unfortunately. I had another great grandfather in the NKVD, but I don't know as much about him.  My grandfather grew up in Berlin, and was an artilleryman in the 60's (there's a funny ""oh shit"" moment he told me about where he very narrowly saved an observation post full of brass from being shelled because of a radioman with a very thick Ukrainian accent).  My father was a radar operator/tech during the Afghan period, but thankfully he was on the second (or first, I have a hard time remembering) air defense line within the SU borders, so he doesn't have many stories beyond the typical conscript fuck ups.

MilitaryStories,2b7d4t,BikerJedi,21,Sun Jul 20 11:47:29 2014 UTC,"I was stationed in Berlin back in the early 70s. A group of us went to a Rolling Stones concert. When we arrived, from a distance we could see that there was a crowd in front of the doors and occasional clouds of white fog.   (Skipping over how we got caught in a bit of a mob confrontation that involved German youths displaying displeasure by throwing egg-sized rocks at the police and, in return, receiving canisters dispensing the ""white fog"")  We found ourselves out to the side of the entry doors, behind the youths, looking for a way in. All of a sudden, from a side gate of the arena (to our back right), a large contingent of riot-gear police come running out to clear the throwers. Even though we were behind the rock throwers, we were in the general area of confusion. Other than short hair, we generally looked like the rock-throwers--and, by the way, it was dark now.  The police came running toward us, holding their ""Gummiknueppeln"" (hard rubber batons) high, slamming them down on targets of convenience. Oh dear. They'd been hearing of their brethren getting rock-bombarded and, starting now, retribution was on its way--and we were directly in the path.  I saw one officer change direction subtly, yet obviously, fixing on us as his next target. His baton raised into striking position as he approached. Luckily, I spoke enough German to attempt mitigation. I held tickets in the air and yelled to him, ""Wir sind Amis! Amis! Wir sind Amis!"" (We're Americans!).  He slowed his pace a little, looked at my hand holding the tickets, quickly surveyed our group, gave us a short, calm acknowledgement (communicating ""ok, that's cool.""), looked for his next target and went running off.  Totally professional. Just trying to whoop ass on the ones causing the trouble.  Concert sucked. Occasional wafts of tear gas. Jagger got booed for an acoustical number."

It stopped raining, but we didn't know that was going to happen. I ache.  The solution of my Sigoth (Significant Other) was weak margaritas and chinese food, both excellent. Dinner is over and I went to the internet while she does breakfast prep. Wasn't expecting this.  Might be one and a half weak margaritas talking. I recited the whole thing. Beautiful. I blinked tears. So well done. So well said.   I remember the calls of the muezzin all through Izmir when I was young, the ezan weird, otherworldly during school or little league games.   Yes.

One morning before the break of dawn I was incrementally going through the radio bands looking for Viet Cong transmissions, slowly turning the knob, stopping now and again to verify one signal or another, moving on. I rolled up upon the oddest signal I'd ever heard, a male voice ""singing"" something so eerie and haunting yet compelling that I almost couldn't believe my ears. The hairs at the back of my neck rose and a chill went up my spine it was so beautiful. I listened for a long time and wondered at it, unable to figure out its meaning, assign the signal a place in my world.   I have never forgotten it but it would be decades, and another chance encounter, before finally I knew it was the muslim call to prayer.  OP, thank you for bringing your poem, I enjoyed it."

I kinda cheated, this was written quite some time ago, and a small literary magazine at my local CSU published it.  I thought, 'why not put it here?'  A stranger in a strange land.  Nothing made me feel as alien as the call to prayer.  When I was able, I always sat and listened to it.  The morning and the evening, espescially.  Maybe I heard god in there somewhere.  I never accepted Jesus, or was baptized or christened or otherwise snarled in any religion.  Technically, though, I am a muslim.  We were doing some big cordon search on the outskirts of baghdad and I was riding with my team and a bunch of ICDC's (Iraqi Civil Defense Corps).  They were pretty much how you old timers describe the sadly comical ineptitude and corruption of various friendly Vietnamese forces, and only slightly more trustworthy than the IP (Iraqi Police).  I kind of spoke a little half-assed Arabi, understood more, and was joking around with one of the ICDC's.  He got me to repeat after him, and when I finished, him and a bunch of his buddies started laughing.  He said, ""Now you are Muslim!""

I think it was in Ramadi, where the above is set, when we had our little stint of guard duty on the front tower.  I've never been religious, none of the guys in our squad really were, but we would all stop and just listen.  All of the muezzins in hearing distance would start at different times, but roughly the same time.  I can clearly remember sitting with Doc on the edge of the tower, watching the sun set over this alien land, and listening to those haunting calls echoing through the city.

Then NSA came to the rescue (cue the bugles), or thought they did. We were shipped these Buck Rodgers looking Jeeps with rear mounted miniaturized radio receivers and transmitters, occiscope, DF unit, scramblers and a large plug board. All this with three antennas, one a very tall side mounted telescoping pole with a large antenna array mounted on top. Complete overkill and a bullet magnet par none. And, none of it worked for crap in the heat and dust let alone the monsoon. There were four of them shipped to the Det along with an NSA scientist to train us on them. He managed to fry one in the first hour of class (great story), we deployed the others for maybe three or four weeks before they were all out of commission.

MilitaryStories,2ag8pc,snimrass,3,Fri Jul 11 21:57:18 2014 UTC,"Proper security measures and practices on all comms networks is vitally important for military organizations. You can be assured that the enemy is listening and attempting to exploit whatever networks they are able to access. It is literally a war within a war, there is no better source of intelligence than what comes directly out of your opponents mouth.   The VC had their counterpart to us ASA / RR types within their own forces who were highly competent and successful in exploiting US communications networks. Every country has a version of SIGINT incorporated into their defense arrangements. Expect the attempt on your networks, it will be happening. Use proper COMSEC or risk compromising operations. Improper use of comms leads to dead soldiers, the bottom line."

We give your types their power and air con, they do their thing in their little boxes and also give us sweet, sweet internet access.   In relation to work, I am more than comfortable knowing that someone else knows the ins and outs of how to run comms, and that I stay away from it lest I get grease everywhere and break things. This has just sparked a bit more of an interest in the actual mechanics behind it all."
MilitaryStories,2ag8pc,SoThereIwas-NoShit,3,Sun Jul 13 12:42:42 2014 UTC,"COMSEC is a layered activity, it is based on keeping secrets, not revealing your intentions, movements, plans or, sometimes, position. It can also involve deception. communications security begins with an awareness that your enemy WILL be attempting to learn all of the above by compromising your protective measures. Every military that is worth the name practices SIGINT (signals intelligence) in the attempt to exploit their opponents communications networks.   COMSEC should be second nature to anyone operating comms equipment or dealing with codes. These days most of the worlds militaries employ electronic encryption on their communications networks for both voice and data. In the old days coding was practiced  too but involved mostly pencil and paper ciphers or codebooks. Those days are gone forever because the old style ciphers are childs play to break and codebooks are cumbersome to use and are relatively easy to break also. I know of one soviet era pencil and paper cipher that is unbreakable if used with random numbers.  There are internet resources and books on the subject - I'll search around tomorrow and see if I can link you to some. Here is one I have bookmarked Cryptome, you'll have to search the site for interesting articles but there is a huge amount of declassified documents related to both COMSEC, SIGNIT, CRYPTO (all subjects are closely related) on the site.   One very good book on the history of codes and codebreaking is David Kahns The Codebreakers. That link is a download site for the book. Kahn's work is dated, especially for contemporary or modern codes but even so all modern cryptology is based more or less on the old stuff. His book is absolutely the best english title on the subject of codes and codebreaking. The NSA went batshit when he published it, tried to stop him. In it he outed the NSA to the american public for the first time.  That will get you started on the subject. If you have questions about what you read I'll be happy to answer if I know the answer."

I remember one particular dismount operation, me and three guys, and my unit kept sending me updates on their observations of us.  That was really, really hair raising.  For whatever reason, they didn't engage us.  They would have fucked us up."
MilitaryStories,2ag8pc,Military_Jargon_Bot,5,Mon Jul 14 02:51:21 2014 UTC,"based on the information of your successors.   I know who they are, some of the current crop visit during our ASA reunions. We regale them with tales from the past, they keep their mouths shut. Just as it should be, we respect that.   Often times my DF site was located on a fire support base with batteries of 105's and other types of artillery support. Id get a hot signal up, DF it, and the word would come back that the contact was actionable (in other words ""we're not getting any intel from this fellow so go ahead and kill it). So I'd run the fix over to the infantry TOC and head back to the Purd. Sometimes the target would still be transmitting, I'd listen and watch the arty crack up their guns and fire. The transmitter would suddenly go off the air. A few times it went from one dah to another but stopped and a continuous tone filled my headsets as if the enemy op fell over his key dead. Good operation, validation and confirmation I was actually making a difference. I come to think of those as an intricate ballet between my work and our combined arms."

A few times it went from one dah to another but stopped and a continuous tone filled my headsets as if the enemy op fell over his key dead.   So bizarre.  It gives me chills just thinking about it.  We never really got much in the way of confirmation.  Once, there was traffic that Faruq had been killed, but there was no way of knowing who killed him.  The couple of BDA's we did didn't yield any bodies.  One had a few blood trails, good fat bright arterial looking, but it could have been any one of us.  A scrap of t-shirt where JDAM's had been dropped.  That's got to be eerie to hear it over a headset.  Got to feel pretty fucking good at the time, but weird later on.  Wow."

I got to weasel my way past children by the side of the road looking malnourished, families living in houses made of old C-ration cartons, prostitutes made of skin and bones, people dislocated, evacuated, homeless. Wasn't my problem, drive a little faster, let's GTFO Highway 1. Nothing I could do.  There was plenty I could do. I didn't do it. No one did, so that makes it all better. I was just one of a crowd.   Nope. That was me. All by myself. I still don't know what to do with that. I've limited my horizons of humanity - kids to care for, gf, friends. Too many scam artists out there.  But damn, man. You got the full shot. Right in the face. Nobody to hide behind. Now you know. You know. All those weasel-people don't know, don't want to know, want to pretend there's nothing to know. But you know. Damn. Not sure what to think. This is beyond right and wrong.  Not sure I like you very much right now. But I'll tell you something.

Because it isn't the sort of story that sits well no matter when or where you read it.  Yeah, it might have been the correct action but that doesn't mean it sits well with the soul or the moral compass. But y'know what, I would do what he did. Don't have the option, no matter how many tears are shed, to dodge SOPs. Maybe it's because I'm still in this job, and will be for the foreseeable future, but I think I have to be prepared for that piece of ugliness inside myself. We've been trained to do things that we all hope we won't have to, but that ill wind is blowing and there are a whole stack of wars waiting to happen. One might have a place for me, and maybe I will have to make that choice too, on a different day in a different land.  Although maybe I wouldn't let my dick do so much of the talking.  Besides, this is where stories interact - some of the people we picked up could have been that woman, just from a different time or a different country. There's one I remember, because she was so damn modern compared to so many other women we picked up. She was on the boat with her husband, no kids, but young, about my age. They sat there together on our flight deck, his arm around her, holding hands, seeming so much more connected to each other than any of the other couples. When I searched her bag, I found that she had lacy underwear and birth control tablets. Never saw that again in another bag I searched, before or after that day. But it was a damn struggle on that flight deck, with the wind blowing a gale and messing up all her clothes, to keep those little things hidden from all the other prying eyes of the people who were sitting on the flight deck. I felt for her in that moment.  Don't remember her face though. Don't really remember any of the faces."

It would've been nice to know that at the time.  We could've quartered her...Where would we quarter her?  Just let her run loose wherever she wanted because she was pretty?

I was the Specialist who made sure your rig was tight before a jump, made sure it fit right, and when the Jump Masters tried to give you shit for being new I told them you were my Jump Buddy and that I'd squared you away, and they left you alone after I told them I had ten or twelve jumps in Division?

We definitely suspected it in a lot of cases - there were a lot of pumps and engines that were pretty easily fixed if you just plugged that back in or reconnected this. Some of the flooding could have Bern intentional, but a lot of that happened because these were small boats that were pretty overloaded and out on the high seas.   Either way, any vessel calls up in distress, someone responds. UNCLOS is pretty clear, and mariners are generally good about complying - never know when it'll be you, I guess. There were occasions where a merchant vessel would be the first to get to a boat, who would then say that they didn't need any help.

It's all crowded and twisted and rummaging in the dark the way it's written, the way reddit lays it out.   You're not the only one who has spent a night in that chapel. I don't know why our holy joes don't preach there, instead of nice clean churches with stained glass that shows, oh, just a hint of blood, so as not to alarm anyone - with a drunk priest and a pretty priest who ""counsels"" sketchy, nervous wives who arrive right at the end of confession - with holy smoke and magic woo! made right in front of your eyes, so real you could swear it never happened.  Why don't they preach there in the real chapel, where someone with certain and assured answers to everything would be most welcome and listened to raptly?   I know why. Wrong Gods. War gods. Valkyries. Nasty, sniping, scratching bloody little gods like these hiding in the bushes. Too holy. Too real. Stained glass will not survive it.  Grump, grump, grump. Sorry. I would like to hear the story of anyone who found his church god - the one you were raised with - in OP's chapel. I was pretty much an atheist by the time I went to war, but I had (and still have) a residual loyalty to Catholic things. I was appalled at how absolutely nothing of my Catholic experience had any application to my war experience. The one place a real religion should be present - OP's Chapel - and Catholicism gave me no tools whatsoever. Epic Fail. Epic, laughable, pathetic fail in the one place they had to be if they were a real thing.   So please, anyone... If you were in OP's Chapel at some time, did your religion show up - johnny-on-the-spot, just as promised? Don't want to fight about it. I really want to know. Please write us a story."
MilitaryStories,2a08gq,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Mon Jul 7 13:35:08 2014 UTC,"Haven't been to those same chapels, but I've looked for god in dark places and never seen a trace of him.  That good god that gets talked about in the real, clean,  nice churches can't care that much if we have to pull kids out of the water when their shitty little wooden boat, where the bilge is full of food and shit and diesel fuel, ends up foundering in the middle of an ocean that is so big you can't see the sides. Or when the ""bad guys"" are young men who are actually 14 year old kids, and the men who actually run these boats always find a way to get off before they get to close to trouble. The real bad guys don't care if the boats sink in the middle of the ocean - they got their money already. Are there probably are some boats that we never found and never heard about - if your engine fails on your half-rotted wooden fishing boat, you're just going to drift until you sink or run out of food and water. I can't say of any specific cases where that had happened, but then again how would we know?  Well, that hit a nerve that I didn't think was still there to hit. Thought I had convinced myself not to care too deeply about what I couldn't change. Must have caught me on a soft day.  Lady Luck, she's there though, in a sea-foam dress looking down on all us little ants running around trying to do things right. She just rolls the dice for us and laughs when all our best laid plans fall apart. If you remember not to jinx yourself, make sure you touch wood, you might get a good roll. But eventually she laughs at everyone. That's just her way."

That part of Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" that is the scary music background of every demonic scene in every movie ever made, is ""O Fortuna,"" a medieval poem writ in Latin by naughty and irreverent university students who drank too much.   Fortuna was a Roman war godess. I would go to her church, except I'm already there. We all are. Even on the high seas. A lot of people who played cop on the streets of Iraq will hear you. Say on.  Even so, I would also like to hear a war story along the lines of ""this happened - I prayed to God - then this other stuff happened - and then my faith was strengthened."" I've heard several over the years, all of them from medical people. Not sure why that is. I was led to believe that such experiences were common, but I don't recall more than a scattered few first-hand accounts.  I'm not looking to mock. I just remember hearing that that sort of thing happens all the time, and my experience is that it happens almost never. Any takers?"

The Taliban didn't shoot as well as friendlies in training, neither did the Republican Guard.  If I am to die, let me die well.  That's it.  The extent of my Praying.  I always thought god was a sham, but if there was a god, I didn't want help or mercy for myself.  When I do die, if there is a god, I want to go out on my fighting feet and punch that motherfucker in the face.  If it (She?  He?) laughs and hands me a beer, I'll know it was all a big joke."

Putting two spaces after each line will create line breaks, and pressing enter twice ends a stanza. Please check out /r/poetry!   Just like every time before  entering the chapel of life and death, I find it difficult to find mine breath.  Solace and respite is forlorn to be, for all I can ever ponder, what is to become of me. Can't find Morpheus and unwind,  for my mortality has already been tested in trine. Memories of times of waking with body torn,  alone in myself I watch forlorn. Thinking of what this wretched time dawn will tell,  when I take that walk to my personal hell.  Will the pain be subdued by this damned scalpel,  or will it go wrong and be left in this chapel. Yet I tread on despite and in spite of the anguish,  to see if these fools my pain can vanquish.  Or will the Valkyries finally come to take,  what even the world and life couldn't break.  It might sound trite, weak and foolish to some,  but to me it gives enough pause to come undone.  And yet I can seem to stop morbidly,  to see what the bright dawn will bring for me. Fears of pain, screams, reveries of the past,  will not stop mine trying to expunge the misery at last.  I owe to them that bled to save,  this last last brother whom is trying to be brave.  So through this tempest of thought I will wade,  once an ace and forever a spade.  So keen to find out what time will tell,  some memories keen, others the wretched blaze of hell.  A simple thing done quick and clean,  anticipation though of what dawn will bring."

MilitaryStories,29ox0u,Sadukar09,3,Thu Jul 3 02:11:54 2014 UTC,"Firing for fun is always good. One time we spent an entire day on the range because we had an army's worth of ammunition which had expired or was close to expiring. Regulations dictate that such ammo cannot be used anymore and has to be disposed of properly.   We were sent on disposing duty, which ment loading every bit of ammo on our vehicles,  driving 5 minutes to the base and firing it all up?  We had thousands of 5.56 rounds for both our diemacos (basicly a m16/m4 but canadian, very friendly weapons!), 7.62 rounds for the MAGs but the best part was the heavier weaponry. Half a dozen panzerfausts, a few LAWs, a crate of AGL ammo, grenades, flares, flashbangs, 25mm ammo for the YPRs, those little mortar rounds (the ones operated by a 2man team, not 88mm ones), 9mm rounds, 50cal rounds and grenades for the underslung grenade launchers.   But the best was that we had two israeli GILLs. Guided missiles. Easily 50.000 euros a piece. And they were fired on a crate. Taxpayers money at work. I got an awesome photo of it firing, were the missile had just left the tube but had not fired up yet. One of those one in a million photo's with the guy firing it standing on a crate (the launch unit was vehicle mounted, we had two persons who knew how to operate it but one guy was a bit short so we had to improvise).  We also had a visit from an American special ops guy who roamed the area, called him viper.  He came to see what all the noise was and we ended up shooting eachothers weapons.  Ill never forget his rifle; a m4 with probably no stock piece remaining. It even had snakeskin butt and heatguards,  not a simple pauntjob but with texture! And a silencer.  My own c7 was a toy compared to his weapon. I mean I even had ironsights. Though i prefer ironsights above anything else. I qualified for advanced marksman with ironsights and I could hit a moving target at 300 meters from standing firing position, something which i couldnt do with optical sights attached."

When you're on it, really on it I'm right there feeling it too, you have that knack for transporting others right into the NOW that you experienced. I love it.   I remember when it all lowered down on me, that oh shit moment. I was sitting in an orderly room answering questions and they began to freak me the fuck out. I was in-processing, passing through what would become my parent unit the 303rd Radio Research Bn.  ""In case you are lightly wounded would you want your next of kin notified?""  ""No.""  ""Okay, In case you are Killed is this the address of your next of kin, your mother, Mrs Dittybopper is it, please confirm the address once again.""  ""Yes, correct."" Fuck this shit, I need a BEER...  So I was all what the fuck for a while, I guess I was beginning to confront the fact of my maybe getting killed by messing around in a war. The mist was clearing from an abstract and the shit was suddenly getting real and i felt like I had entered a one-way tube to be ejected into a shooting war. Which was exactly what happened when I came under fire the first time perhaps three weeks later. For just a moment there I just couldn't believe it! ""What in hell, some son-of-a-bitch is shooting at ME, what the fuck did I ever do to him?"" It hadn't dawned yet that all I had to do was show up. I wasn't mad at anybody...   If I hadn't read your story I wouldn't have been transported to that orderly room to relive that Q&A. Thanks, I mean that."

For just a moment there I just couldn't believe it! ""What in hell, some son-of-a-bitch is shooting at ME, what the fuck did I ever do to him?""   Reading that made me laugh, because it's the exact same reaction I had (plus ""Wait... so do I shoot back now?  That's what we do, right?  It's okay to finally do that thing we've been practicing for??"") and then I found out later that it's the same reaction EVERYONE has the first time they come under fire."

MilitaryStories,29axa0,Dittybopper,1 point,Thu Jul 10 19:50:46 2014 UTC,"On my second deployment, where there was a lot more shooting and trucks getting blowed-the-fuck-up and our platoon actually did some good clean killing, I had some experience.  We knew we were slated for a pretty hot area, and it was.  Those of us who had combat experience (five out of six TL's and my SL, and a few of the Joes) were very serious about keeping things in the Family.  I was new, but an NCO, and told them not to make more friends than they had to.  Me and Chris (my counterpart) were ignored, but we were lucky.    When I got to the unit and was logging my new guys' personal information I had to get the address's of their Next of Kin, along with serial numbers for weapons, and sensitive items, and boot and uniform sizes, and all of the other boring stuff.  I told them straight, ""Who do you want me to send the letter to when you get killed?""  That sobered them up pretty well quickly, or got turned into a joke.  Those of us who'd been in fights talked about hoping for a quiet deployment (while secretly hoping against anything but), while the guys who hadn't sang the opposite tune for a while.  After they were introduced to the severity of the situation, you could hear them wishing for quiet missions, and in their talk about hoping for a quiet one, you could hear who the killers were.  The guys who wanted to sleepwalk through it and get coffee and sleep and laundry detergent at the big FOB with the PX.  Those were the guys who had accepted that they were dead.  The fuckers that came across the radio while they were re-loading, cool and calm.  Putting rounds out with zeal, but mostly chill and professional.  Those were the cats who knew they were already dead.    I know a guy.  I used to really like him until our first big firefight.  He actually admitted to getting down from the gun and hiding.  I lost all respect for him.  I still don't have any.  I still see him occasionally, and he's an OK dude, but I can't respect him.  Maybe I'm an asshole.  I was in the same fight, so I guess I can judge?  I didn't have a wife and two kids, like he did, but I felt like he valued his own life above ours, and couldn't trust or respect him after that.  Don't know where I was going, but surely my train-of-thought is de-railed."
MilitaryStories,29axa0,Dittybopper,2,Tue Jul 8 04:28:25 2014 UTC,"Wall of text coming....  Who cares about the derailment, yours were all good talking points and interesting.   After the clerk got his info regarding where to send my corpse I then found out my unit assignment, something called the 856th Radio Research Detachment located with the 199th Light Infantry Brigade. Okay fine, and I wondered what this detachment did and why they were attached to the infantry. Oh I knew what they did, in general, I had just PCS'd from an 18 month stint at an ASA Field Station, Torii Station, on Okinawa. I was a damned good Morse Intercept op, fully versed in our, the ASA's Mission. My last work at Torii had been a special intercept mission, and before that I was copying ChiCom diplomatic traffic. Still, infantry, what the fuck. I had fully expected to go to Vietnam and do my job, work my MOS. That would have naturally involved intercepting VC/NVA commo, that I could do no problem with a little training on their specific communications operating procedures which I already knew were not too different from the Chinese army radio intercepts I did on Oki. I expected to work in a building, or perhaps in a van. Both rumored to be equipped with air conditioning mind you... Shift work, a comfy bunk to return to each day. One of my buddies on Oki had gone off to Vietnam then came back on an R&R spouting wild tales of being on a DF team, talking crazy, I didn't give it much credence, seemed like he was exaggerating for effect to me. Pierre was like that, a wide open personality and funny as hell to.  I get to the Det via helicopter, they are down in the Delta near a little village called Cat Lai with the 199th. The 199th had a duel mission, to protect the shipping that stacked up in the Saigon river near Cat Lai awaiting their turn at the docks, and to train the 5th ARVN Rangers who's AO we shared. The guys at the Det lived in tents, they've been there a while and had cobbled together various living amenities, gotten as comfortable as possible. I'm sure you know all about living in the field. They had also built a club out of 2x4s and plywood, a small place, but it had ice cold beer and a limited stock of hard stuff.   My immediate job is to learn the mission, OJT the VC/NVA communications structures, not hard for me except the enemy has shitty equipment and a lot of their operators are sub-standard code senders, made them difficult to understand and copy and the static often overcame their weak signal. Still, all in all it wasn't a bad setup and you could grab a cold one and a shot of whiskey at the end of your shift. Or, trot down to Cat Lai if it was still daylight and get into something different, very fucking different. When I first saw the Star Wars movie the bar scene in it reminded me of Cat Lai which in addition to the froggy little native folk had a population of merchant marine and ship crews from all points of the earth. The ships were lined up one after another in the river boarding Cat Lai. There was a contingent of ARVN sailors and a Popular Forces unit that pretended to protect the village. Exotic, the word, for a newby anyway, and I was green green green. I didn't feel much of a sense of danger, the guys did carry their weapons everywhere, I had been issued one too, one of the original M16's - the one with the bad rep for jamming (which proved true once I tested it). So I too carried one, like I knew which end to use - we ASA didn't receive any AIT on real army stuff like warfighting, we had other shit to do. There was one thing you dreaded though, the silence when the generator stopped - you knew that beer at the club was getting hotter by the minute... Actually everything ran off of generators so if they went out the mission stopped in its tracks. To say the least the NSA didn't like it when the mission stopped so you can rest assured immediate steps were taken to get them back on line. Then too there were ""things"" happening off in the distance, at night, firefights, explosions, flares at all hours. The chopper pad was situated in a field next to the Det and between us and Cat Lai. You'd see the infantry queued up to board them, armed to the teeth and on the way out to play cowboys and indians like I'd never know, medivac choppers would occasionally land to let off the lightly wounded cowboys to amble over to the brigade aid station. The brigades CO, a one-star, would sometimes land in his spit shined bird, a command chopper fitted out with the latest in commo gear, his aids following him like a gaggle of ducks sporting custom 45s and pig stickers with shining hilts. It being the dry season when each copper landed it kicked up a whirlwind of fine clay dust which as often as not settled over the Det. In other words there was movement, the brigade coiling and uncoiling during the day, stepping in the shit at night, all this happening ""out in the [mythical] bush."" There really was a war out there, its sign was all around, but we in the Detachment felt not much of it.  I had two weeks of scheduled OJT to complete but still didn't know what my final assignment would end up being. I learned the mission sitting ""side-saddle"" with another more experienced Intercept op, meaning my head-sets were plugged into the same two receivers as his and I had a separate typewriter to copy the incoming code on. We were scrunched into an Intercept van, a duce and a and half truck with a modular van clamped down in its bed. The van was hot as hell with all its tube driven electronic equipment turned on and everything very close, it was literally like a sauna inside it. It was backed up to a catwalk that lead all around the Dets compound including to the tent quarters and the club. I was taught to recognize the Viet radio traffic, its regular operating procedure, higher and lower echelons and to differentiate between signals coming out of North Vietnam and those in the south, for us the real targets. COSVN was the main HQ of the VC and NVA operating in the south and a priority target anytime they were on the air. From there it went down the usual military chain of command until it arrived at our main interest - those enemy units operating against the 199th LIB, the Redcatchers. The lower the command echelon the weaker the signal and generally combined with the worst sounding code sender so the most difficult to copy. Often when you copied at the regiment or company level the transmitter was bicycle powered and the signal went up and down as the man on the cycle slowed or sped up. Then too sometimes the operator wasn't using a telegraph key but a couple of wires he'd tap and scrape to make dits and dahs - this would sound like a goddamned insane chicken scratching inside an amplified oil drum, now put that sucker with a bicycle generator - fuck! One of the operations of intercept is to obtain radio direction finding on the transmitters, to attempt to locate them on the ground.   End part one..."
MilitaryStories,29axa0,shoemanchew,2,Tue Jul 8 22:52:05 2014 UTC,"Part two:  For that the Detachment ran three DF teams. And being on one of the teams was the job I eventually landed in. The teams were located out in the bush with the infantry so as to cover the infantries Area of Operations and to be as close their targets as possible, the DF units were short range. Those DF units (the AN/PRD-1 Radio Direction Finding Receiver, or as we called them The Purd) the teams operated were supposed to be good out to 5000 yards but in Vietnam their range was more on the order of 3000 on a VERY good day and generally only good out to 1500-2000yds. I have DF'd a transmitter as close as 300 yards. It takes three high confidence DF bearings to obtain a firm Fix on a target transmitter. When you took a bearing you also assigned it a number designating how good, or how confident you were in it. A 5 ment it was gold, a 1 was shit. You could tell on a map too how good the bearings were - if they all crossed at a single point you had a firm fix, if they made a larger triangle them it was a shit fix, at least one and probably two of the bearings were off. Several things could throw a bearing, atmospherics, bodies of water, presence of signal deflecting and reflecting objects located near the DF site, distance to the transmitter. In addition the enemy ops knew damned well we were tracking them and did all sorts of shit to throw us such as remote their antennas up to a mile from the actual transmitter. Along with that you had to be quick about obtaining a bearing because they purposely limited their time on the air so as to not be caught. A typical DF mission (us trying to get a fix) lasted a few minutes at best; during that time the x-mitter had to be found on the air, details of his signal communicated to the other two teams, bearings obtained and that info transmitted back to HQ for plotting on ""The Big Map."" Then, if immediate action was authorized, the fixes coordinates transmitted back to the DF team so one of them could provide the location to the 199ths S-2. From there it was in the infantries hands as to what happened. Sometimes they simply fired artillery at the location, sortied gunships, or sometimes they mounted a ground operation.  In this way the Det supported the 199th operations. As I have mentioned it was necessary for the teams to be out near the spear point to do an effective job in support of the infantry, short range DF work. Being on a team made for interesting work, sometimes dangerous, never boring. My Vietnam tour, after that brief OJT training and once I joined my team, became a blur of constant movement interspaced with brief vignettes of ""shit happening."" Its like the recording camera would jerk forward at top speed then slow to comprehension, then speed off again. It took me years to piece it all together, I'm still at it. We on the teams moved when the infantry moved, we moved to help cover them as they moved and then they covered us as we stopped to do our work, then off again. Operations tempo was high with the 199th, and it wore my young ass down to a nub.   That enough for now Master Grinder - I think I will rework this and turn it into an /r/military story. I don't know if anyone would be that interested though. All the typos are mine alone but I'm too tired at the moment to give a care.  Cheers"

I went to college and got my BS in physics and mathematics. Decided to join the AF so I applied to OTS. Best day of my life was the day my recruiter called and told me I was selected for Space Operations. My family joked about me in the AF, little brother joined the Army and is in Korea. Everything went just fine, a few hiccups at MEPS and I was finally at Maxwell to become an officer. Long story short I ended up in the hospital and a benign spontaneous heart arrhythmia was found. Nothing about it would stop me from PT, nothing about it was progressive or even remotely dangerous but next thing I know I found myself on a plane back home with an entry level separation.

I honestly think the above story may have been Normandy, I can't really remember.  It was one of the larger ones, but had no FLS.   I've had more shitty jumps than not.   The winter that this took place, must've been '02, I was thoroughly cursed.  I don't know what I did to deserve it, but it had to be something bad.  All of my jumps I came in backwards, usually windy as hell, and did the old 'feet-ass-head' landing.  Got knocked pretty silly a few times.  Are you still at Bragg?"
MilitaryStories,28rwcr,Military_Jargon_Bot,2,Sun Jun 22 18:12:35 2014 UTC,"Winter of '02 was when Operation Frozen Falcon took place. Indeed, a shitty winter. I recall waking up under my hooch in the field to find that it had pissed freezing rain overnight. After crawling out, I could actually see my outline frozen under the poncho, Vesuvius style.  I remember guys TRYING to get frostbite because we were ill equipped to be out in the strange cold snap.  I too had a tree landing, my last jump in division, right after getting back from Iraq. Sicily hollywood day jump, my only other day jump since my cherry jump, and our whole chalk would up in the trees.  My other defining jump memory was being second jumper behind our battalion XO, watching him standing in the door, thinking, oh good, it's raining, we won't be jumping today. The XO had final say over whether we jumped or not, for some reason. I watched him argue with the Air Force guy for a bit, about why we hadn't slowed down. I distinctly remember thinking, ""yeah, we haven't slowed down, we can't jump"". And then the yellow light came on, still going way faster than we should have been.   XO was still arguing about something, and in slow motion, I watched the green light come on, the XO look out the door, shrug his shoulders, and jumped. My body was on autopilot at the point, but there was definitely a little voice in the back of my head somewhere going ""fuck, fuck, Fuck, Fuck, FUCK FUCKFUUUUUUUUU"". Much more loudly than that voice normally expressed itself. Turned out to be the softest landing I've ever had. Stood it up, accidentally, and then fell over because I was supposed to.  I also wanted to echo xixoxixa's comment of ""are you me""? Perfect writing captured it exactly."

Then they did, and half the people ended up in the trees, and the other half ended up hurt. A Battalion or Brigade commander got relieved if I remember right, for being so hard headed.   Not there anymore, I left in 05, left the infantry, and became a medical guy. Haven't been back since, although I wouldn't mind taking my kids to go see the Airborne and Spec Ops museum one day."

MilitaryStories,28m45e,SoThereIwas-NoShit,17,Fri Jun 20 03:56:38 2014 UTC,"I sit here on a busy morning drinking my one-a-day alloted cup of coffee and cocoa and a little sugar. Been doing this for going-on 50 years now, every morning I could manage it. Back in the jungle with the ARVNs the MACV team was assigned an ordonnance, an orderly, I guess. The English term was ""batman."" All officers were assigned one to carry their stuff.  The four or five of us only had the one batman. It was a good gig for an ARVN - our guy was the envy of all the other batmen. Americans got a regular supply of sellable stuff - soap, toothbrushes, C-rations - and the batman got whatever we didn't use, which was a lot.  Every morning, our batman would boil up some water, then put in all the coffee, all the creamer, all the cocoa and all the sugar we had. We were all awakened each morning by our batman, who handed us a C-ration can full of that mix as we rolled out of our doss. Usually, I'd roll over into a crosslegged position and sip coffee/cocoa and stare around at the morning jungle.  There is a genre of war-stories like yours, OP. The Civil War literature, for instance, has an abundance of these campfire idylls and night-watch meditations. These are a necessary part of the story. These moments are what get you through the the more exciting parts. These moments are also what gets you jacked up for the more theatrical and dangerous things. Because, before and after these moments - especially after you've caught up on sack time - you are bored out of your fucking mind. Please God, let me go kill something.  But those moments... I remember. Our coffee/cocoa was more often than not, weak tea. The batman stretched what we had as far as he dared, and would apportion as much as he could make equally among us, because we were Americans and we apparently didn't understand RHIP. There was always a hint of coffee and chocolate, and some mornings way better than that.  I make my morning coffee lush with cocoa. It still drinks like a good morning in the jungle. Going on 50 year now. If you're going to remember things, remember it all. It's better that way.  Thanks for the memories, OP. Well done. I was no place like where you were, but I was there. Nice."

MilitaryStories,28m45e,snimrass,3,Thu Jul 10 04:06:35 2014 UTC,"Oh shit, I almost forgot about the coffee.  Coffee was my saviour.  At first all we had were these five pound bags of Folgers that'd sat in a warehouse for so long they didn't smell like coffee any more, and more than half had been chewed into by mice so they were about 80% stale coffee and 20% mouse shit.  We were probably spoiled because we didn't drink that shit after the first time we found mouse shit in it.  A cute-enough girl from back home sent me my first real coffee, and oh my god it was so amazing I would have married her.  She turned out to be the kind of gal who thought that she deserved an officer slot because she had a college degree -- even though she washed out of OCS.  So that didn't work out, but the coffee sure as hell did.  In the winter we couldn't fly because our little bird had a carbureted engine and the venturi would ice up and stop the engine.  Fuel injection is too good for the Army, I guess.  So I'd get up in the cold, walk across the gravel to the hangar in the dark, and if all three aircraft were there I'd know it was going to be an easy night.  I'd head to the rear office (which was really just some slapped-together 2x4s and plywood along one side of the hangar) and together my NCO and I would discuss which bag of coffee we should brew.  We all had some sent from home but Ms. Entitlement had sent me the good shit, and plenty of it.  So we'd grind the beans, wash the eternal dust off the pot, throw out the top filter (again, dust) and sit in silence while our black gold dripped.  Every three or four days my NCO would say that he wished we had the kind of pot that would stop the dripping when you pulled out the carafe, so he could pour some while it's still fresh.  This inevitably kicked off a series of jokes about how shitty Iraqi appliances are - it's not exactly high fucking science to have a little spring in there that closes when you pull out the pot.  It's not the zenith of modern fucking technology.  This is what passed for humor.  Speaking of humor, we only had about four jokes: gay jokes, dick jokes, ""your mom,"" and ""that's what she said.""  They went in and out of fashion.  Once when ""your mom"" was the only acceptable response for any statement, my NCO got out our label maker and labeled his coffee mug YOUR MOM and walked around waiting for someone to say ""Oh?  Well, YOUR MOM is full of coffee!"" to which he responded ""Why yes, your mom IS full of coffee!"" and displayed the label.  It took about three minutes for him to get the desired response.  Like I said, this is what passed for humor."

MilitaryStories,28acuw,AnathemaMaranatha,49,Mon Jun 16 15:51:05 2014 UTC,"[Continued from the OP]   ‚ÄúHello Sgt R_. I brought a replacement for the boots Gunny gave me in the Song Bo. 11 EEE. I heard you guys went back to the A Shau while I was gone. Where's the Gunny?""  SFC R_ looked tired, angry and wounded. ""The Gunny is dead. That FNG Forward Observer they sent because you were too fuckin‚Äô busy to show up, dropped a round on his own head. Killed himself. Killed the Gunny.  ""Where WERE you, man?""  That was the worst thing I‚Äôve ever heard. The memory is burned onto my brain. I remember what the room smelled like, how SFC R_ looked, what his voice sounded like, what I was wearing, how hot I was, how dirty everything at PK 17 was, how I went numb and stupid all at once, how loud all the sounds around me became, how the room kind of shrank away from me. I remember everything every which way it can be remembered - sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, ESP, gut - every way.  I have no idea what happened next, or how I got out of there. I must've left the boots. I never went back, never saw Sgt R_ again.  So it was a year since that. Time to think about it here in the dark.  The Firmament  ‚ÄúFirmament‚Äù is a strange word. It‚Äôs in the King James version of Old Testament - ‚Äú‚ÄúLet there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.‚Äù - happening on the second day of creation. I always thought it meant ‚Äúland,‚Äù but no. The firmament is the sky, which was conceived of as a dome over the earth, wherein were writ stars and comets and portents and planets and secret designs of a Higher Power.  Couldn‚Äôt see that firmament on this anniversary night. Couldn‚Äôt even see the low clouds that blocked out all possibility of light from the sky. It was pitch black - where it was black. The heavens had no light for us that night. The Earth was another matter. The Earth was aglow.  My eyes had adjusted to the dark. I could see the radium watch-face of a military wristwatch maybe five meters away, glowing like a streetlamp. All around me where I was sitting crosslegged, the ground was glowing pale green-yellow. Well, not the ground, but the vegetable detritus on the ground. Must be phosphorus in the soil. The living plants were black. I could see the silhouette of tree-trunks and living leaves - black shapes superimposed over the background glow. I could see my jungle hammock, my gear, my rifle, my ruck - strange black shapes over the pale glow, no detail, but meaning and purpose in their outlines.  It was like I was a part of some underworld's sky - a dark, mysterious shape in the earthly firmament that overhung some subterranean world of burrowing crawling things to whose sky the Creator gave no light but the radiation of decomposing flakes of vegetation. I imagined those creatures looking up, seeing the black space of me, my gear, the trees and plants - black spaces in their firmament whose regular, unnatural shapes hinted at some mystical, unknowable purpose beyond the ken of their subterranean lives.  My mind does that. You may have noticed. I‚Äôve got something sad and important to think about, and sure enough, my mind goes haring off into crazyland. But I was amusing myself, imagining that I was Orion in some dark sky lit by pale-green flakes of leaf-bit stars. Plus, the scene was quite amazingly beautiful. It was an unexpected gift.  Then I noticed a beetle of some kind. It must have been eating the vegetation, because it was all lit up with phosphorus light. Then from behind the dark void that was a tree, came the best thing ever. It was a disco-millipede. Must‚Äôve eaten a ton of dead leaves because it was bright. Hurt my eyes, all day-glo green and shining. It made its multi-legged way across my AO minding its own business, and expecting me to mind mine. Was wonderful. A millipede comet across my chthonic firmament. I wonder what the groundlings made of that? Was it a portent of disaster? A sign of good luck? A mysterious omen?   Whatever the subterranean astrologers would make of it, they‚Äôd be wrong. Right? I dunno. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt just a millipede. Maybe it was a portent, an omen, a sign. Maybe it was all of those things, and a millipede with an appetite for phosphorus too. I was pretty happy not knowing. I liked all the possibilities.  The Gunny was dead. A year now.  That thought landed like a short-round in my brain. What was I supposed to do with that news? I didn‚Äôt know. If the millipede knew, he wasn‚Äôt tellin‚Äô. Fuck this. I packed it up for another day. Time to sleep. Big day tomorrow.  The Wall  ""Another day"" came twenty-two years later. The Wall was coming to town. I had to go see. Had to. I needed to look up some names, most of all the Gunny‚Äôs. It was like going to church on a sunny June day. I really didn‚Äôt want to go. But I owed some people.   There was a traveling Vietnam Memorial Wall a while ago. It was like half or a third sized. They would set the panels up in Memorial Park, Anytown, USA, and the survivors would come from their PTSD bolt-holes and touch the carved names and stare at their reflection in the shiny black pseudo-marble. I had to go.  It was, in fact, one of those preternaturally-bright Spring days Colorado produces to discomfit those who are still in winter-mode - insanely blue sky, little nip in the air. The grass in the park was just coming back to life. Across the grass, like a black slash through the daylight, was the dark, reflective stone of the Wall.  I saved the Gunny for last. I had the panel number and the row.  I had been writing in anticipation of this visit - kind of summing up what I owed the Gunny. Here‚Äôs one thing I wrote:   There is a steel inside me that isn‚Äôt mine. It was given to me. Even so, it makes me stronger. When I reach for it, the grip of it is like a K-bar knife.   Okay. True, for sure, but in a not-that-dramatic way. Kind of overwrought. I was kind of overwrought. That‚Äôs how I had been feeling, that I should write things like this about the Gunny. I owed him a story, an obituary, something that made him not so damned dead.  I found his name. I sat down in the grass in front of the panel stunned. I never knew the Gunny‚Äôs first name. His first name was ‚ÄúIrving.‚Äù I was trying very hard not to laugh. I failed.  Whaaaaaaat???? Irving? The hero of this melodrama is named Irving? Who‚Äôs writing this? What the hell, man? Give him a strong monosyllabic name - Ike, Mike, Rod, Bob, Rip! Are you kidding me?   I vaguely remembered one night when SFC R_ was teasing the Gunny by calling him ‚ÄúIrving.‚Äù The Gunny was embarrassed and annoyed. I thought it was a private joke between them. Nope.  I was embarrassing and annoying myself, sitting there crosslegged snurking and snorting suppressed laughter among all of these sad, reverent people. I caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror surface of the black wall. Jesus, fat and forty-two - ten years older than the Gunny, older maybe even than SFC R_ was when I knew him. Huh. Well, if the Earth is round, the firmament is in every direction, even sideways. In the firmament of the Wall, my reflection was a piss-poor, clownish Orion. What the hell was I going on about?   I am the shining millipede of fate in the firmament of the Wall. I spoke my doom writ in my reflection, writ in the dark stone, to the audience of names inscribed there. I spoke to them all, something I'd heard on TV the night before: ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, dying is easy. Comedy is hard.‚Äù I took a bow, and left. I felt better.  Well, think about it. What battle buddy ever said, ‚ÄúIf I die, here‚Äôs what I want you to do. I want a little piece of me to live on inside of your brain. I want you to be sad whenever you think of me for the next five decades. I want you to dwell on how unfair it was that I died and you lived, how it was probably your fault. Do that, because wherever I am, that will make me feel much better.‚Äù No one ever said that. No one would. I can‚Äôt imagine any ghost that wouldn‚Äôt rather hear something funny that happened to you, something hilarious that wouldn‚Äôt have happened if he hadn‚Äôt saved your sorry ass.  This is a true story, as best I can make it so. I don‚Äôt know the moral. I do know why I‚Äôm not invited to funerals or other solemn occasions.   This is a story that stars a man named Irving. I don‚Äôt know who wrote it. I‚Äôm just telling it. It happened. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean anything. If it does mean something, I don‚Äôt have to know what that is. This happened. You tell me.  The World  The last card in a tarot deck is called ‚ÄúThe World‚Äù - it means Everything, and the answer to any question about Everything is always ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù This story drew that card.   Is this a dark story? Yes. Is this a sad story? Yes. Is this a happy story? Yes. Is there a deeper meaning? Yes. Is there no meaning to be had? Yes. Is this an old story? Yes, old, old, old, back to the Sumerian army. Is this a new story? Yes, I‚Äôm typing it right now. Does this story have an ending? Yes, soon.   Does this story go on past the ending? Yes, yes, yes. It‚Äôs happening right now - if you‚Äôve read this far, it‚Äôs your story too. There is light in your dark. Dark in your light. It makes you. You make it. But maybe you should ask whatever weight you‚Äôre carrying around, those ghosts who live in your head, ‚ÄúWhat do you guys want?‚Äù My guess is that they want a beer.   The End  As promised. Let‚Äôs make it an ending the Gunny would‚Äôve liked.  Here‚Äôs how it goes: Be the World. Bring your dead with you. Say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to the Divine Comedy. Lose the shakes. Climb into the chopper, boots on the skids. Rev up with the roar of the blades. Skids up! Tilt forward! Lean into the momentum! Lock and load! Lift up up UP! Here we GO! Woo!!"

MilitaryStories,28acuw,ZipRush,5,Mon Jun 16 22:02:47 2014 UTC,"I've always been impressed with what dad has written about Vietnam.  His writing style has an appeal.  It fairly blunt, to the point and usually deals with dark situations with a twisted sense of humor.  You write very poetically.  I really wish you'd put your experiences together into a mostly autobiographical book.  Dad isn't as in touch with the existential experience.  His writing is more head.  Yours is more heart.  Question:  Were officers in the Marines the only ones who could call in arty?  As a buck Sgt. in the Army, dad was calling in strikes with surgical precision.  At times, he had to call fire missions practically on his own position, because they were in serious danger of being overrun.  He never lost a man to friendly fire.  I did spend my entire childhood being accused of mumbling, because his hearing was shot.  He avoids large spaces with lots of background noise, because it echoes in his head and he can't pick out individual sounds.  There's nothing wrong with his hearing, though!  Dammit!  Old soldiers are annoying, irascible, lovable bastards."
MilitaryStories,28acuw,saltedfish,4,Tue Jun 17 00:32:18 2014 UTC,"Old soldiers are annoying, irascible, lovable bastards.   Speak up, boy! Say what?  I wasn't a Marine. I'm not sure what they did for fire support in Vietnam.   Anyone can call in fire. When you're dealing with someone who doesn't know the official procedure, the Fire Direction Center of the battery will do the technical stuff based on what the person calling for fire tells them is happening. Even so, a battery would be very reluctant to fire ""danger close"" missions based on a non-trained observer's reports. Friendly fire casualties ended careers. Heads rolled.  Artillery 2nd LTs were assigned to each company. I never met an infantry officer who didn't think he could adjust artillery, or encounter one who actually could. It's much better to have a trained observer at the bang end of a fire mission. Makes things move faster. Makes things much safer for friendlies.  They have something called FISTers now. Maybe someone else can bring us up to speed on that."
MilitaryStories,28acuw,gunguolf,7,Tue Jun 17 00:56:44 2014 UTC,"Bit of an anecdote:  One of the high points of dad's career in country was calling in fire support from the USS New Jersey.  He called in a fire mission and was greeted with an odd call sign.  After a while, shells the size of VW Beetles started landing.  The initial impacts weren't enough to set off the contact fuse.  The rounds would porpoise through the elephant grass a few times before detonating.  Seeing a round bouncing through the turf toward you was, apparently, somewhat off putting."

So they had their own guns.  The most surprised guy I met in Vietnam was a Navy Corpsman who was humping the boonies with the Marines. He thought he joined the Navy. He wasn't complaining, just surprised. Once somebody calls you ""Doc,"" they own you. He was taking care of his people.  I think the Marines do something like that with artillery too - there are teams of spotters for Navy guns who boonie-up with the jarheads. I don't think they are led by Ensigns, more like Master Chief Gunners, or some rank like that.   The Army would rather lose a green 2LT than a senior NCO. Hate to say it, but I think they're right."

Chaplains have heard every variation of this story. They can order up counseling and whatever else you need.  But there's also this:   I can't talk to my unit about it.   I'm not going to question your reasons for this. I just want to let you know that your unit - any unit - can be the best medicine for the ""Dear John/Jane"" blues. We used to see about one or two of these things a month - a letter, a phone call, text mesages, even in person on a first-time-off-the-base pass. These things are hard to hide in a barracks or in the jungle.   Was party time, and GI John/Jane was the guest of honor. Reply letters got written by a committee of pissed-off soldiers. Some drinking occurred. Much congratulation to the guest of honor on dodging a bullet, and what a complete asshat that was walking away from pure gold. It is both comforting and healing to be the center of attention at these festivities. Many stories are swapped around, some of them instructive and useful.  I got a taste of it when I got my draft notice in Basic Training. Obviously, I wasn't upset, but a party was had anyway. After some intoxication, a letter was written to my Draft Board that peeled paint off their mailbox. It was fun. Helped make us a unit. Made me feel better, even though I wasn't really feeling bad.  I'm just sayin'. Your unit can and will go about the business of making you feel better, and have a little fun in the bargain.  Assuming that the only reason you're being shy about this is that Mr. Dickhead made you feel ashamed and embarrassed, you might want to re-think talking to your unit. Could do some good.  I am looking forward to part 2 of your story. Shoot for a happy ending."
MilitaryStories,27afm0,AnathemaMaranatha,7,Wed Jun 4 15:36:24 2014 UTC,"Consider posting to the relationship advice board here on reddit.  It sounds like you have a lot of hurt in your past, and it sounds like you might be in a tumultuous, possibly even codependent relationship that is far, far from healthy. The reality is that after your divorce you probably ended up in a relationship too soon because of how crappy that divorce was making you feel. You wanted to take it slow, that's because your gut instinct was that you probably didn't need ANY romance in your life at that moment. But maybe you wanted the support network, or the feeling of worth, or hell maybe just getting laid...but the bottom line is you let yourself move on from your past relationship too soon.  Now, I'm not saying this guy is peaches and cream either, in fact he sounds like a real asshole...not what you need. I want you look at this relationship and at the one before it and see if you can see any patterns. Patterns  teach us about ourselves and how we act and who we are drawn to. If you see a pattern of bad relationships that have a lot of drama and chaos, maybe it's time to start looking into therapy and see why you are that way.   Couldbe simple: you grew up in a chaotic home, maybe you were abused growing up. Could be complicated: you ended up in a marriage with a dude who really wrecked you up. Maybe it's none of the above! Maybe you're the nutjob (no offense) who abuses guys and they eventually push you away. It's really hard to tell from this one post...but I can tell one thing: you need to talk to a chaplain, and you need to analyze your life. I'd break up with the guy ASAP. Not because he's automatically bad and you're automatically good, but because it sounds like you never really healed from your first relationship and have a lot of things to sort out before you start getting involved with people.  I know that's tough to hear, and tougher to live...but if you're breaking down at your job things are not good.  Good luck soldier"

When we got back to the main area, she collapsed and her face was really really white.  The medic ran over and literally ripped open her BDU and brown t shirt.    There were maybe 8-10 of us standing near her.  And after 12 hours of rucking in the woods, we were kinda out of it too.  We literally just stood there and stared at her shirtless body, with only a bra on.  It only lasted about 5 seconds before the LTC was like ""GET THEM THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!"" And they dumped ice on her and gave her an IV.    She had no memory of falling over or anything after that for the next few minutes.  Lol, you kinda forget about genders when you're really tired during the 2 month event.  So seeing her huge chest with bra on was like unbelievable at the time for us 19 year olds.

MilitaryStories,272suz,oberon,5,Tue Jun 3 01:44:27 2014 UTC,"Along the same lines, when I was still on my first enlistment contract, I was talking with one of my (then-)wife's friends, Michelle.  She asked what my opinion of gays in the military was.  This was before I'd gone to Somalia.  I told her that I was completely opposed to the idea of gays serving.  She wanted to know why, so I told her.  ""I don't like the idea of them checking me out in the shower.""  ""Roman... Think this through.  For one, you're not all that hot.  Probably 1% of the women on the planet look at you and say, 'yeah, that's nice.'  95% of them look at you and say, 'don't care.'  and the other 4% would say, 'Ick.'  Now, I'm just going to go ahead and say that the gay men in your company are about the same.  You don't look at every girl and think about sleeping with her.  Maybe a few percent meet your standards but the rest are either girls you'd ignore or girls that disgust you.  Don't you think the same thing applies no matter the gender or whether they're gay?""  ""Maybe. Sure. I can see that. I guess I'm just not comfortable with that small percent checking me out in the shower.""  ""Roman.  YOU'RE ALREADY SERVING WITH THEM.  YOU'VE ALREADY SHOWERED WITH THEM.  And, none of them have hit on you.  Every girl knows that some guys look at them and undress them with their eyes and yet somehow we manage to survive from day-to-day.  So what if there was a gay guy in the community shower that glanced a little too long at you.  If you aren't projecting gay vibes back, he's never going to bring it up.  And, he's been there the whole time never questioning your qualifications to serve.""  Germany did a lot to unweird me about nudity as well.  You quickly learn to accept it or you get to spend your time in the barracks.  You would regularly see chicks just strip down to nothing and jump into the canal right in front of their office co-workers.  It's a little startling the first time you see it.  But, what really clinches the deal is when my (then-)wife and I went to the local pool.  We walked up to the locker rooms and there was a door for Damen and a door for Herren.  So, we parted ways and went through our respective doors.  About 3 seconds later, we notice that we're still walking next to one another.  It was two doors to the same damned room.  And, once you find the thermbads, it's all over.  Everybody is just walking around naked from sauna to sauna to cooling pool to sauna and you either get used to it or go home."

Every soldier's death leaves a person-sized hole in the world. Families and friends will be falling in that hole, walking around it and tripping over it for decades. That's the nature of the beast. That's the risk people who serve sign up for, the sacrifice they're willing to make.   Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Coastguard and Marines won't ever tell you how to vote, or who to vote for. That's a citizen's job. It's also your job to make sure that whatever sacrifices and hardships servicemen incur are worthwhile. They won't ask before they go, so it's your duty to remember that.

MilitaryStories,26g2xn,Dittybopper,7,Sun May 25 14:24:52 2014 UTC,"It's funny. When I got into I Corps in early Feb 1968, it was clear to everyone that we were dealing with a professional army. Russian-trained too. They mapped and practiced everything - even set up little obstacle courses to practice climbing the walls at Hue. They made a complete division basecamp in triple-canopy mountain jungle outside of Hue. Very nicely done, too.  When I got down to your country (northwest of the Delta, thank god), they just seemed to be twigging on to the idea that they were dealing with NVA regulars. Everybody kept saying ""VC."" No. Not if it's a big attack. NVA. They got Russian war rules. They're predictable.  Yuck to the Delta. I heard it was mostly a VC thing there even after Tet. Bushwhacking farmers. I think I prefer the NVA. What a dumb thing to say after all this time. Huh. I dunno. Guerrilla war just seems petty and sneaky and mean. Gangfights. Needs cops, not soldiers."
MilitaryStories,26g2xn,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Sun May 25 19:04:37 2014 UTC,"I only spent a month in the Delta when first in-country. It was pretty much as you think, down and dirty war and double-cross and ambush the game. I then spent the remainder of my tour in II Corps. After Tet68 the VC were decimated, hurt bad. Throughout 68 their loses continued and by mid 69 we were dealing with NVA by and large. I remember reading intel reports when I worked for Big Brother of how even those NVA were starving by late 69. They were motivated (read from their own message traffic) for the Tet69 attacks on Long Bien and Bien Hoa by being told of the feast they could obtain by overrunning those bases and eating captured GI stores. They took to wearing P38 can openers strung around their necks during their attacks. Many of their dead were found with them even prior to the attacks by LRRP teams."
MilitaryStories,26g2xn,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Sun May 25 20:11:00 2014 UTC,"Ah the memories. P38: a so-so can opener, but a mighty fine aircraft. I'm glad the NVA got the former. I believe the flying P38 was the A10 of its era.  Y'know, I think I missed Tet 69 too. I was on leave stateside. I'd worry about that skipping-the-hard-stuff habit, if I was younger.

That map struck a cord since I had only a few months prior been making maps just like it and knew what it took to do it.

They always packed it in there like it was an afterthought - like it wasn't part of the original design. It all makes sense now. Some guy got his dingleberries cut by a stranger in Korea, and doesn't ever want to talk or even think about that experience again.   Nice story OP. Thought we'd drifted into a lost passage from To Kill a Mockingbird there for a minute, but hey, dingleberries... I now officially request amendement to the Real/Fake rule: True war stories are identified by copious references to diarrhea or dingleberries.  All in favor, vote ""Gross.""  God, I hated grenades. We had standing pin inspections for frags, and those pins were required to be splayed at at least 45 degrees. Even with that, we had to medivac just about all of 2nd platoon well into the wee hours of the night when some grunt tossed his ruck, something hooked on a frag pin, which set off his claymores, and the next thing we know 35 men were down.  The nastiest thing I carried were a couple of WP grenades. You'd better believe I had those pins pushed out to 90 degrees plus. Ugly way to die.  Still, I can understand being in a hurry. Close quarters is no fun. The biggest hero in our company was a 19 year old E4, who was playing at Platoon Sergeant while we waited for the Army to send us a real one. He tossed a whole platoon's worth of frags to cover the evacuation of his wounded. He kept shouting for guys to toss frags up to him. They rest of the platoon finally got the wounded dragged back to cover, then some of them had to run out and tackle the PL SGT/SP4 and drag him back. Honestly, I think he was having fun out there. He was certainly all grins.   The solution to grenade pins was supposed to be the M79 grenade launcher. Trouble was, the 40mm grenade didn't arm until 29 meters past the barrel. Not good for close quarters. It didn't replace grenades at all - it was a kind of mini-mortar. Plus it made grenadiers unpopular. Grenades would explode when the spoon flipped and the fuse popped. That's about it. They were pretty impervious to other means of explosion. Grenadiers carried belts of 40mm rounds wrapped around them. A bullet or shrapnel would set those things right off.   When I joined my cav company, they were still telling the story of a grenadier who got hit by shrapnel and went off like a string of firecrackers. He was still cooking off rounds twenty minutes later. They just let him lay there for a couple of hours, and then asked for volunteers to go help separate what was left of him from his unexploded ordinance.  Looks like you set me off, OP. War stories on Memorial Day weekend. Little fragments of me and my mental ordinance flying everywhere... Gotta bend my pins out further."

I half want to laugh at the firecracker grenadier and the other half wants to shudder at the very idea.

Alas, my military career was all of three years, if you don't count reserves. I wrote exactly one Lessons-Learned report in longhand, which was dismissed by a REMF 2LT who probably had already gone to college. I cringe to remember this stuff, even on the Weekend of Memory. Seems like this war experience should've gotten less apt-to-mind and dimmer in the rear-view mirror. Not so, and I'm a little embarrassed about that. Seems undignified. But, y'know, fuck it.

Just another naive assumption, that. I'd heard complaints that the paperwork in the military is worse than police paperwork.   For the record, my parents remember everything about the Vietnam War. It was the news 24/7, I'm told. Dad remembers when the last Japanese soldier of WWII came out of the jungle and surrendered.

It wasn't a million dollar wound, because shoulder wounds can cause nasty permanent damage, but it would get you home.  A bullet piercing a WP grenade six inches from your face almost certainly would be fatal.  I don't remember where I heard the anecdote.  I think I read it in an autobiographical account.  Guy had just started to throw a WP grenade when a bullet hit it (and his hand).  Massive burns.  The medivac guys thought he was dead.  Back then, they would shove one of the dog tags between the front teeth to make sure the body and tag remained together.  The wounded soldier had a gap between his teeth so the tag wouldn't stay put.  The medic was holding the tag in place preparing to kick it into place.  Wounded guy regained consciousness at that moment and scared the medic so badly that he nearly fell out of the chopper."

There was a barber shop run by Afghans, and I liked to keep my hair long, so I went there.  Except the day I thought I was surely fucked, and had one of my guys give me a mohawk the night before.    A little back story.  The Route Clearance guys we replaced told us of two partial IED's they'd found inside the wire.  One was inside of one of the ubiquitous bunkers outside of our quarters.  Someone had noticed wires sticking out during a rocket attack.  After it was over, they'd gotten EOD involved, and it was an IED in the stages of construction.  Sneaky fuckers.  The other was found on one of the Route Clearance trucks by the operator when he was doing PMCS.  These things led to me being pretty paranoid in the wire.  More so than outside.  I also firmly believe that they were gunning for us because when the base got rocketed the bulk of them fell in our area.  The barbers were good.  Quick and efficient, and after you got past the weirdness of it, the scalp and neck massages felt pretty good.  They had scissors, though, and shaved you with a straight razor.  Never once a single nick, but I didn't ever trust them.  I'd always bring somebody with me, or go with one of my guys.  I'd have my M9 locked and loaded, safety off, in my lap under the barbers bib.  Every time.  What a fucked up way to get a hair cut.  Good shit, as always!  I think we all just faked the funk.  If it comes down to just straight shooting...well, that's the easy part.  It's the other 99% of the time where it gets weird."

For those of you who don't want to dig: Arjuna is the prince/hero of the Mahabharata, the Indian version of the Iliad and the Odessey and Enuma Elish and Gilgamesh all rolled into one. It is an epic story of princes and princesses and wars and murder and revenge and just deserts and you name it. The  Bhagavad Gita is a later, more religious work, inserted into a moment in the Mahabharata where Arjuna is mustering his armies for the climactic battle of the epic.  Arjuna is surveying the battlefield. He sees all the formations of his own soldiers and the enemy ranks, and he is suddenly struck by the horror and the uselessness of all the death that is to come. What do those soldiers on both sides know of Arjuna and his cause? What do they know of the lords who oppose him? Why are they willing to fight? Who is Arjuna, that he should author all of this meaningless murder?  Arjuna has a chariot driver who is not what he seems. He is, in fact, Krishna kind of meta-god (a god to the gods). He usually appears as a blue youth, sometimes a child. He hears Arjuna‚Äôs soliloquy. He is not impressed. ‚ÄúWhat is all that to you?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúThey are doing their duty. You are doing yours. Everything is as it should be.‚Äù  Arjuna somehow knows who is chariot driver is. But Arjuna is a prince. He demands more information. Surprisingly, Krishna indulges him. Arjuna is given a vision of the backstage of Everything. What he saw is the subject of some argument. Whatever he saw, he eventually calmed down, rode back into the Mahabharata and covered himself with blood and glory.  The relevant allusion here concerns the part where Arjuna returns to normal space/time from peering beyond the veil of reality. His eyes are big as saucers and his hair is standing on end and smoking.   I love that. Hair on fire - the Arjuna moment. It's a real thing. Muggles don't think so."

MilitaryStories,25u89b,Dittybopper,4,Mon May 19 15:32:05 2014 UTC,"Judges, yeah, I've known two fairly well. One wasn't sober if he could help it, the other pretty sober mostly. I love how they can make things happen if you ask and they feel like it. Power to move things, a word from them can part the waters. Power."
MilitaryStories,25u89b,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Mon May 19 18:35:33 2014 UTC,"With great power comes great responsibility, right?  Not my experience. With great power comes a kind of bizarre narcissism.   Non-war story: I was a Prosecutor in rural Colorado. I was prosecuting a former Texas State Trooper, who drove home and found two boys visiting his teenage girls against his express orders. The boys ran to their car and peeled out. Our guy didn't even check on his girls - that's how worried he was - and took off after the boys. He told the cops that he wanted to chew them out in person. He later changed that part of his story.  Anyway, he rides the boys' bumper all the way along a gravel road motioning at them to pull over and getting madder and madder. The boys aren't cooperating. When they hit the highway, they stomp it and head for the horizon. Our ex-trooper catches up to them, and then performs one of those high speed bumps designed to spin a lead car off the road. He wasn't in a trooper car, he was in a pickup. It's a miracle he didn't roll those boys at 60 mph. But he didn't. No casualties. Some consequences, though.  I filed a raft of charges, including a couple of felonies, which took it to District Court. We were assigned the newest District Court Judge. He had been county court judge in a local ski town, and he was one of those macro-biotic, my-body-is-a-temple, prissy guys, so right away he wasn't getting along with the local lawyers who were more cowboy in their outlook. He was smart as a whip. He thought so too. Consequently, the disapproval of the local bar was, to him, merely an artifact of throwing the pearl of his intellect in front of so many rube swine.   He was not a popular judge. He was not a drinker - honestly, anything but the finest wine would have corrupted his exquisite body. But he was not the kind of person who could remain sober in the presence of power. He liked being a judge. He liked it a lot. All in all, I think it might have helped if he had drunk more.  He estimated that I was... oh, ""salvageable"" comes to mind. He was going to mentor me to a higher plane. Okay. I'm in favor of anything that gets my cases through court. I'm pretty sure I was the only Deputy DA in the District that he liked. I was his bitch. Yeah, I could tell he thought that. I didn't care.  The ex-trooper made the mistake of hiring a lawyer that the judge hated. They hated each other actually. The hatred was civil, if visceral. I honestly think the Defense Attorney should've let some other lawyer take the case.  Court happens. Evidence happens. The ex-trooper testifies that he was worried about his girls, and he needed to stop those boys out of concern for his girls' safety. The boys were in no danger - he had been trained in that spinning maneuver. Had he trained in his pickup truck? No, a cop car. But he needed to talk to those boys.  We got all the evidence in. We're in chambers doing jury instructions. Defense wants a self-defense instruction - when someone is authorized to use reasonable force in defense of himself or others. I pop in with ""Objection."" That's all the judge needed. This was going to be fun. He proceeded to lecture the Defense attorney at condescending length about self-defense, and how there was no evidence that fit that instruction. The Defense attorney maintained that self-defense was their entire defense, and the court was leaving them without any defense at all.  The Judge was loving it. The Defenses dilemma was of his own making. The court simply could not allow a self-defense instruction. The law was clear. It was pretty creepy. The Judge was drawing out the agony. In fact, he enjoyed himself too much. So far, all I had said was ""Objection."" The Judge had been making all my arguments. I finally chimed in. ""The People will withdraw their objection to the self-defense instruction.""  The Judge was flabbergasted. Was I sure? Yes, Your Honor. You know the court is required to give a requested instruction unless there is a valid objection? Yep. The People know that. The Judge went into full pout. The instruction stayed in.  Then we made final arguments, the jury went out, the jury came back. Guilty on one felony and a couple of misdemeanors.  Sentencing set for some time in the future. Defendant is re-bailed on his own recognizance. Court adjourned. I went to visit with some other people in the courthouse. On my way out the door, I was hailed into the Judge's chambers. ""Don't ever do that to me again,"" says His Honor. He is clearly miffed with me.  ""Do what, Judge?""  ""You know what. You pulled the rug right out from under me in front of that man."" That man? Is this a soap opera? The Judge went on, ""You know that instruction was improper. You know there was no evidence to support it.""  ""Yes, You Honor. I knew that. But they had already raised the idea of self-defense and defense-of-others in the testimony. The jury would be thinking about it whether they were instructed on the law or not. I wanted to tell them in closing arguments why this was not a matter of self-defense or defense-of-others. I couldn't do that unless the jury instruction giving the definition of those things was in front of them. So I withdrew my objection. If I had been the Defense attorney, I would've shut up as soon as you rejected the instruction. The Defense would've done better without it.""  The Judge was thunderstruck. I was right. That wasn't really the problem. I had NOT been thinking of HIM! I was disloyal! I let him be humiliated in front of a man he hated! I was a baaaaaaad bitch. I acted like winning the case mattered more than the bloated dignity of the Court.   He was right too. He always treated me like I was some kind of snake-in-the-grass after that. He was, all-in-all, a good Judge. You could make a complicated argument without exasperating him; he liked a lively discussion of the law. But he was also on a seriously bad power trip. Needed a rehab there - judge is just a job in the final analysis. Drama queen is not one of the qualifications."

I'm just gobstopped. Kurt Vonnegut was captured in the Ardennes and held in Schlachthof F√ºnf in Dresden, where he emerged as part witness and part perpetrator to the ruins of that city after the American and British bombing. He decided right then and there that this was going to be his epic, Tolstoyan novel.   He spent decades waiting for his novel to emerge from his brain. He got nothing. The thing itself was its own story told in non-epic terms - buildings were destroyed, precious things were lost forever, people were killed, nothing of military value was destroyed. He couldn't dress it up. It didn't need to be dressed up. It needed to be seen with comprehending eyes.

MilitaryStories,25t07l,AnathemaMaranatha,24,Sat May 17 18:06:40 2014 UTC,"(Continued from OP)   Robert Heinlein in Starship Troopers imagined a rank for cadets who were ready to graduate  - Provisional, Supernumerary Third Lieutenant. Before they assumed rank, the cadets would be required to shadow a real lieutenant in the field.  I think that Third Lieutenant is an actual US Navy rank from time to time. Heinlein‚Äôs rank came with a set of ‚Äúpip‚Äù insignia for the new officer. Those pips were returned to the Officer School, because the rest of the military had no use for them. Sometimes they were returned personally and with honor, at which time the cadet graduated. Sometimes they came back with honor but without their Third Lieutenant and a Wounded Lion decoration. All pips had history. Some were unlucky, some deadly, some revered.  I liked that reverence. It‚Äôs a real/fictional reverence - honest, knowledgeable. Heinlein‚Äôs OCS cadets were all battle vets. All of them were tested in battle before they took command of soldiers. It frightens me that our Assistant S-3 2LT could easily be a general now.  We should do that with our highest-trained soldiers - dip them in the Styx and test them in the Sticks. The boonies can kill you, but they don‚Äôt make you stupid. Can‚Äôt say that for military school. For God‚Äôs sake, somebody has to tell these over-trained and coddled youngsters that whatever the size of the ring they‚Äôve been given, they‚Äôve  just spent four years in Dad‚Äôs basement. Time to go outside. Time to get some exercise."
MilitaryStories,25t07l,SoThereIwas-NoShit,10,Sat May 17 18:07:32 2014 UTC,"We called them Pointers, and there was a collective groan whenever the battalion got one.  I had one for a Company Commander, before Iraq.  He was such a piece of shit.  He'd hang his troops out to dry if, he had the opportunity.  I remember one of the guys from our platoon getting sent to the Brig at Le Jeune before being kicked out for being with a dude who got a DWI.  Same said CO left the Battalion Ball drunk as a skunk, driving.  We all prayed that he'd get popped.  This was before the ubiquitous cell phone, or about ten of us would have called the MP's on him.   Locate them first, see them first. That is a huge advantage that you give up if you go the easy way down a trail.   This is precisely what we didn't do in Afghanistan.  It was like the Loony Toons with the sheepdog and Wile E. Coyote.  We had a joke at one point that we should just have comm's with the Taliban, so they could have everything set up.  ""Mujahid.  Mujahid.  This is Infidel, over.""  ""Infidel.  Mujahid.  Go ahead, my friend.""  ""Roger, Muj.  We're having mechanical issues with one of our Vic's.  Expect a delay of fifty Mikes. Break...You in the usual spot?  Same same?""  ""That's a roger, Infidel.  We'll be expecting you soon.  Thanks for the update.""  ""No problem, Muj.  See you soon.  Infidel out.""  I did like Heinlein's take on Officer-hood.  I've always felt that no one should be eligible to even be an Officer until they've attained the rank of E-6.  Then it should be a selection process with a high failure rate.  Other than the administrative part of things, Officers seemed pretty useless for the most part.  Of course that's my GWOT perspective, and it may be wrong, but the bulk of things below Company level were usually at the discretion of NCO's in my experience."
MilitaryStories,25t07l,moving0target,4,Sun May 18 01:26:59 2014 UTC,"That's how granddad did it.  Then again, that was in the 50's.  As far as I know, he was one of the last mustangs.  He caught the tail end or WWII, and he saw some nasty combat in Korea.  He told me about taking out a machinegun nest set up in the mouth of a collapsed railroad tunnel with a flamethrower.  He had a twisted piece of rifle-shaped metal to back up his story.  Back in the States, he was assigned to the 307th (I think?).  An M108 crane truck got stuck in the mud.  The butterbar in charge came up with the brilliant plan of hooking the crane to the front bumper of the truck and lifting out of the mire.  At that point, grandpa decided if that dumbass could become an officer, he could, too.  He was a cowboy who grew up on a ranch in Texas.  He was one of 15 kids (some of whom lived to adulthood).  In that time, if you were poor, you grew your own ranch hands.  He used to always say that they were so poor during the Depression, they they didn't know it was going on.  Since ranches require quite a lot to maintain, he wasn't in school much.  When he joined the Army, he had a 7th grade education.  I don't remember the precise details, but he was accepted into OCS.  It caused quite a stir since he wasn't even a high school graduate.  While in OCS, he got his GED.  Despite being the only one there without a college diploma, he completed OCS ahead of everyone else.  Throughout the rest of his military career, he always took the utmost care of his men and did his best to put their interests first when possible.  By the time he retired, he was a Colonel with a couple of college degrees."
MilitaryStories,25t07l,colonelFury,3,Sun May 18 14:45:32 2014 UTC,"I had one for a Company Commander, before Iraq. He was such a piece of shit. He'd hang his troops out to dry if, he had the opportunity.    I hear you. But I don't think we're saying the same thing. I'm not down on Academy guys. I have met many officers of all ranks who were exceptionally good at their jobs - no drama, no ego, get it done, protect the troops entrusted to your care, listen to your NCOs. Guys I would follow happily, just about anywhere.  And an astonishing percentage of those officers were Academy grads, maybe over 50%. Which should not be surprising. They vet the hell out of those cadets, then they are trained by seasoned military, for the most part. They are harassed and drilled and trained and then praised to the skies upon graduation. They made it! They ARE that superior military being everyone has been to make out of them for the last four years!  Yeah, no. The good ones I met had already been to see the beast. That either kills you or knocks the bullshit out.   And I sort of agree about who should go to Officer School. I think NCOs ought to be doing Officer recommendations from the ranks. But an E-6? All the E-6s I met were pretty up into an NCO mindset. Officers and NCOs are different. That's an ancient distinction that I think still holds up.  What I can't understand is why they don't salt those grads before they inflict them on the rest of the military. Why is that such a hard thing? Hell, I remember coming out of six months of OCS and being sandbagged by the very Army I had been a part of six months before. You tell a bunch of OCS candidates to stand at attention, and you can hear the snap-click. I was a little shocked at how low a rank 2LT was, and how little admiration or respect those butterbars induced from the EM. By ""how little,"" I mean less than none. Some mockery.  I can only imagine what four years of playing toy soldiers does to your mind. So what I'm worrying about is smart kids who think they know it all, who know nothing. I can't imagine a more dangerous combination. So why not salt 'em before they make fools of themselves or get somebody killed?   Third Lieutenant. Then dump 'em in the deepest shit you got. That's all I'm sayin'.  Of course, a suspicious number of those Academy graduates turn out to be asshats. I'm guessing a high percentage of them have a general officer in their parental unit, or are really good football players.  So I couldn't agree more. An asshat with table-smashing Academy ring is an asshat indeed."

MilitaryStories,25t07l,Military_Jargon_Bot,4,Sat May 17 19:38:38 2014 UTC,"Way back in the dark ages I too played those board games. They were fun, took forever and you learned some useless shit. Tactics II, Gettysburg, Panzer something or other. And then there was Squad Leader which really did take forever. My sister was dating a guy last year who actually owned all the Squad Leader games. One sunday we broke the first issue out and played. I kicked his ass mainly because he had not a clue of even basic tactics or a feel for where I could hit him next. Reminded me of some newly pinned 2LTs I have known.   Good story!"
MilitaryStories,25t07l,rat16,2,Sun May 18 02:09:49 2014 UTC,"Good story!    Glad you liked it. More importantly, you played Tactics II? Wah! We are basement brothers!  I liked the historical simulation part of war games. I didn't really care who won. I just wanted to see how the battles unfolded, see if we could duplicate history. I remember the first Gettysburg, the one without the grid hexes. Pretty good game. Still and all, there was no Confederate commander in our group who would voluntarily replicate Pickett's charge. Perfect intelligence skews the game, and makes clear what an idiot move Lee made. I think the man was drunk on his own legend.  They don't teach that in history classes. I remember being shocked at the giant painting in the Gettysburg museum showing the ""high tide"" of the Confederacy where they reached one Union battery on Cemetery Ridge before getting blasted to pieces. Glorious. Gallant. So insanely stupid, the kind of thing an unseasoned cadet would admire. I hated it. I hated a general of Lee's calibre making such a rookie mistake, wasting the kind of men who could - who would - do that.   That painting showed everything we should be teaching military officers not to do. I don't think they're teaching that - not anywhere. I hope I'm wrong."

He was (roughly) a medium.  The sweater was XL.  He was wearing it during a firefight one day.  After things settled down, he checked himself over to make sure he had the usually number of holes a human is supposed to have.  In the process, he noticed that the oversized sides of the sweater were riddled with holes.  Shooting at a shape in the jungle, the shooter shot where flesh should have been if dad had filled out the sweater.  Even if it was too hot to wear the sweater, he carried it everywhere.  I don't think it's still around, but I'll as when next I see him so I can post a pic if it is.  Edit: His other good luck charm was a 1858 Remington New Model Army .44 replica, but I've told that story before.  It saved his life more often than conventional small arms in close quarters.

Actual real barracks and when you stepped into their mess hall you thought you were stateside. In late January of 68 my partner and I were assigned there briefly, we were billeted with the Air Combat Police who provided security for the whole base. They gave us our own cots with actual sheets and a blanket. The first morning we ate at their mess hall. holy shit GI, choices! Steak and eggs (real eggs) cooked to order! Real honest to god milk. This was no army slop shute, this was a dining facility. The whole base was like that, partner and I were like two kids in Disneyland.

He was only a few years too late for the sexual revolution. He died as a straight-arrow, straight shooter, straight-talker jammed in the closet with a moving-van-load of tri-sexual no-no-not-me woe.  But the 50's hoisted him on his own petard and let him die in sorrow and denial trying to be something he wasn't. It was a stupid time. John Wayne looked like everyone thought Audie Murphy should look. It's funny how Hollywood has reinforced our stereotypes. The baddest ass I knew was Killer Joe, and he looked like a shy divinity student. I assume there is a divinity student out there who looks just like John Wayne. Guess which one gets to play Killer Joe in the TV movie?  It stinks that the public continues to buy into that bullshit. The funniest - now forgotten - reaction to movie-soldier Ronald Reagan running for President was voiced by a Hollywood casting director:  ""Ronald Reagan for President? No, no. Ronald Coleman for President! Ronald Reagan for 'Best Friend.'""  And now Ron Reagan is our bestest and toughest President ever. God. If Obama were white, he'd be a lot whiter'n me.

MilitaryStories,2556am,just_foo,16,Fri May 9 18:41:11 2014 UTC,"You think? Stop loss is the involuntary extension of an enlistment contract for current members of a unit slated for a deployment. It extends the ETS date so that the members aren't released from active service midway through a deployment.  It's never been a punitive action, there's no legal basis for it's use in that manner. It also only applies to enlistment contracts. As an officer, your cousin isn't under an enlistment contract. Stop loss wouldn't be needed because an officer can be called out of the IRR at any point for any reason at the needs of the Army.  You're not in yet, so it's not that strange you might not know this. If your cousin used those words to describe it, then your BS meter should be registering."
MilitaryStories,2556am,AnathemaMaranatha,11,Fri May 9 18:48:10 2014 UTC,"Oh y'know. Maybe OP's cousin was referring to a cork, and it came out stop-loss. I can think of a couple occasions when a cork would've come in handy for just that purpose.

Gotta take a shit. Gotta find somewhere to take a shit. Found a nice place to take a shit. All of that is an everyday thing. Grossing out a platoon of schoolgirls is just icing on the cake.   So yeah. Seems legit."
MilitaryStories,2556am,just_foo,7,Fri May 9 21:12:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah - it all came across a bit more harshly than I intended. It's just that a couple of factors didn't quite 'smell' right. I'm wiling to chalk it up to the mangling that happens in any story when it gets re-told by different people.  I mentioned in another comment, I had an instructor at OCS that used to tell a similar story (no schoolkids, though) about how he was on patrol in Iraq and needed to drop a load really badly so he did right in the open in the middle of the street.  On a completely unrelated note - this has all got me thinking about language and vernacular as an expression of group membership and belonging. It makes we want to go see if anyone's done any academic research into how people establish legitimacy in various groups by using tacitly agreed-upon language to indicate commonalities. The manner of speech becomes a shibboleth so to speak, communicating ""I'm one of you"" to the listener.  Maybe that's why we can find it so jarring when we hear people get it wrong - it sounds like someone claiming ""I'm one of you"" in a way that actually communicates ""I'm not one of you"". Anyway - I should quit rambling on an internet forum and get back to work."

I'm curious now exactly how your cousin described it.   The story itself sounds like a variation on a common theme. I had a CPT tell a similar one to me when I was in OCS. That, coupled with the incorrect use of ""stop loss"" makes me wonder just how truthful your cousin's stories are.  He may be completely honest about it all, but I have my suspicions."

It was an exact duplicate of the story told by Richard Marcinko in one of his books.  Obvious bullshit.  If you know a bit about the details of the war, you can generally tell if the story will pass the sniff test.  Vietnam pretenders don't generally know about the Tokay gecko know more colloquially as the ""Fuck-You"" lizard, for example.

A lot of military dross and bullshit can't seem to live outside of the hothouse of a large base.   It was kind of fun to go back sometimes. I hitched a ride on log slicks back to Bien Hoa, a huge airbase outside of Saigon, to get some financial stuff done. I couldn't get a ride back out to the field, so I prepared to doss out on the benches of this giant roof thingy with no sides that was the main terminal.  I've got my weapons and ruck - smoke grenades and canteens hanging everywhere, a claymore bag full of ammo, a couple of WP grenades because you just never know, a wire sling with LRRP rations, stained pants, stained shirt, stained T-shirt, muddy boots, steel pot. I've got one side pocket full of maps and one full of a stained copy of Thucydides' ""History of the Peloponnesian War,"" an M1 compass on a string around my neck, two bush knives, a machete, and my M16.  The AF tech sergeant at the counter tried to get me to go to the BOQ at Saigon, which sounded good - I could've used a shower - until he told me I'd have to check my weapons at the desk before I got on the bus.   I don't think I growled or did anything threatening. I just was astonished at the idea of going anywhere without weapons - must've shown on my face. He took a step or two backwards. I told him I'd be fine on one of his benches. Hey, overhead cover and a breeze! Can't do better'n that!  I gave the AF sergeant a big, reassuring smile. He allowed as to how they could work around my one-man bivouac. But one more thing... ""Uh Sir. Could you take the bayonet off your rifle? It's freaking people out.""  Oh well, yeah sure, I could do that. Didn't want to be a bother.  I still like that story. Wish I had it on video. I'd give a nickle to see what I looked like to that guy."

Mostly I was a grunt-like POG. Walked point once, but only because I was tired of being asked ""Do you even point, bro?"" in the jargon current at the time. I was in the first chopper on any combat assault. So there's that.  I guess I could settle for ""Grunt-like POG."" Not a REMF, tho'.  Stupid to still be touchy about these things, no? What the hell's the matter with me?"
MilitaryStories,252spv,Dittybopper,3,Fri May 9 23:52:56 2014 UTC,"in the strictest sense of the word, POG means anyone whose MOS doesn't start with 11- or 03-. I disagree with that. First off, you got the big-5 combat arms jobs - infantry, arty, combat engineer, cav/recon, and tankers. i would never call any of those guys POGs. those are the carnivores -   then you got the combat support guys who roll directly with the combat dudes - their medics/corpsmen, the K9 teams, the bomb squad dudes, the psyops and civil affairs guys, the combat controllers, etc.   ultimately, my view is that if a guy signed up with the knowledge that he was going to be both trained and expected to be put into harm's way, under the most austere of conditions, then that pretty much rules out POG/REMF status.   then you got my old outfit's chemical-weapons guy. every line company has one. turns out iraq didn't have those darn elusive WMD's. so our NBC guy got bored with helping run the TOC; early in my first deployment, he comes down to our line platoon and runs missions with us for the rest of that and the following deployment. he sucked as much sand, lived in the same filth and misery, and took the same bullets and bombs as the rest of my platoon. so even with NBC-dude, who didn't sign up with intention to train, live, or fight like a combat dude, turns out that was the hand he was dealt. and i'll never ever think about considering or calling him a pogue."

MilitaryStories,252spv,autowikibot,2,Mon May 12 00:48:33 2014 UTC,"i was an infantryman. but it's well established that combat engineers are combat arms. and only the cherry-boot privates like to sling the word ""pogue"" around to refer to the 99% of the military that isn't infantry. that's why it's called ""full-spectrum,"" ya know? once upon a time i was a private, and when i called the cav scouts ""pogues,"" my squad leader slapped me down like a dog that had sniffed too close to the barbeque.   edit: i wanted to go back and add this in. my second deployment, the task force only lost 5 guys - only 1 of which was from combat. we had several wounded, also. as always, the combat maneuver organizations - the infantry - with arty fister teams, the battalion cav platoon, the tankers, and the combat engineers conducted the missions - and hit the bombs. in one instance, the task force's engineer company had a patrol out and they hit a double-stack antitank mine set with an RG31. the truck crumpled like stomping on a soda can, caught fire and burned. one of their guys went into the hulk several times to pull the crew out. he suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns over a good portion of his body. he got the PH and an ARCOM/V (while officers and platoon sergeants got BSMs for showing up to work, but that's another rant).   that guy is a hero. i'm not a hero; i'm a dude who showed up for work and didn't screw up too many times. so i'd probably get that little red-haze at the corners of my vision if anybody called combat engineers ""pogues"" within earshot."

MilitaryStories,24x8cn,Dittybopper,6,Thu May 8 02:01:38 2014 UTC,"Ho boy... yes. Now you're into it Grinder, telling the tale as it ought to be rendered. Extreme detail, good.  One has a tendency to forget, at least for longer and longer intervals all the little shit you did. Like weapons cleaning, nothing more important in your day and if that were true then you were doing fine that day. I carried the old M79 Blooper, loved that thing beyond its true merit. In the dry season it got a going over three or four times in a day, during the wet not so much. At first I had a S&W .38 Police Special revolver as the 79 backup, later a 1911. Those got the same treatment.  Did you guys have Mad Minutes? Generally we'd fire our weapons all in unison in the late evening to ensure all was good with them."
MilitaryStories,24x8cn,Dittybopper,4,Wed May 7 21:35:27 2014 UTC,"We didn't do test fires in Iraq.  I actually never fired a round while I was there.  Our ROE were very strict.  I actually held my fire three times that I can think of, when I would have been legal to engage.  One of those times the motherfucker almost hit me, but the concern was hitting houses with families in them, and the fact that I couldn't see.  Maybe I was wrong.  In Afghanistan we'd do test fires once we were still in the friendly section of route, but away from the local nationals.  We also did them when we were in a shitty spot, because we weren't allowed to recon by fire, but we could do test fires.  Go figure.  I'm guessing you would all do a mad minute to keep the enemy from getting an accurate idea of your numbers?  They always had eyes on us.  We always assumed that they knew what we were doing.  They confirmed it occasionally when we got reports of them reporting to each other what we were doing."
MilitaryStories,24x8cn,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Thu May 8 01:34:42 2014 UTC,"By and large we were never near civilians or their towns so a Mad Minute wasn't going to endanger them and we would (literally) mow the bush down for a little bit to ensure our weapons fired before dark. Once you cleaned and fired it you didn't mess with it. I slept with mine also.  We had pretty strict ROE too but from what I hear from you fellows it was not as tight. Then again, we didn't have anyone carrying an AK that was not an immediate candidate as a target. If we got shot at, village, town, whatever, then fire was returned in spades.   Short story: Observer. A shout went up one time on a Fire Support Base I was on, we had been there maybe three days and were completely dug in underground. There had been no operations in this area northeast of Saigon since the French Indochina war, maybe 25 years past. It was known as an enemy stronghold, which, of course, is why we were there. Anyway, a shout goes up, an enemy observer was spotted up in a tree on a ridgeline maybe 6-700 yards off. The arty guys begin cranking in their guns. Within a couple of minutes I hear the fire command. One round of 105mm fires, tree burst, dead on, blew that sucker sideways out of the tree. Cheers all around, lots of back slapping and such at the gun crew."
MilitaryStories,24x8cn,Dittybopper,5,Thu May 8 02:35:57 2014 UTC,"That is so cool. I never fired direct fire with a howitzer. They didn't even practice that with the towed guns. But everyone was wild to do it. Gun bunnies used to sight and practice dry fire. Hitting a tree at 700 meters is pretty good.  Not sure what the ROE was in I Corps. We had ""free-fire"" zones, where you could engage on sight. We modified the rules to except farmers cutting wood or gathering vegetables. People gotta live, right?  But on one road crossing the Rue Sans Joie my armored cavalry unit used to do ""Thunder Runs."" After dark, no lights, all the people who weren't up to no good should be safe in bed, we'd barrel down the road at top speed shooting all the way. Not sure what the point was. Sure was fun.  I heard they did that in other civilian areas, supposedly to discourage IEDs and ambushes. Never saw it done in the south."
MilitaryStories,24x8cn,Shpadoinkles,3,Thu May 8 22:15:43 2014 UTC,"mow the bush down for a little bit...   This was literally in our handbook.  Our FM 5-34, the Engineer Field Manual.  Small arms and machine guns to clear a defensible perimeter.  Maybe you cats had something to do with that?  P.S.  Good shooting by the Gun Bunnies"
MilitaryStories,24x8cn,Military_Jargon_Bot,6,Thu May 8 03:52:35 2014 UTC,"In a field manual, well I'll be damned. It works, you could see the bush recede as men fired, it just moved away as saplings and small trees fell every which way. The 79 and M60 gunners chopping down larger trees. Those fallen trees creating a barrier too for anyone attempting to sneak through it. No way to run in it, or even walk upright.   One of my standard entertainments was to watch the reaction of NUGS (New Guys) to a Mad Minute suddenly occurring. I often got sent NUGs to OJT with me. Of course its all new to them and they're nervous as a cat but trying like hell to act unaffected. I didn't make it any more comfortable for them by telling them that night was coming on and if anything was going to happen it would happen then, that we owned the day but Mr. Charles owned the night.  I'd see the infantry getting prep'd for a shoot off but not say anything to the new guy who, of course, didn't have a clue of what was about to happen. When the whole world suddenly lit up with small arms fire the guy wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind, like a deer frozen in the headlights, while I'm sitting there like nothing is happening. Mean of me but funny."

I believe in people trying to be be good folks, and doing the best that they can.  I believe in kindness and compassion and love.  I may not be good at at it all of the time, but those are the things that I want to define me.   We are broken.  It doesn't take a missing foot or arm to be mangled.

Maybe it was something on the news about shock and awe which you know is bullshit because you know who goes in after all the pretty fireworks and does the down and dirty work and gets it all over them. You feel so damned bad for them it just kills you, but there it is. You cry as another generation is fed into the mill (over and over, deployment after deployment) and you know you'll be hearing all the ripe bull from the usual sources but you know too well what the reality is behind all the horse manure. You understand its about loss and the irreplaceable, yours and theirs, but knowing that won't help. Still, it is just a moment and it passes, you buckle and button up and go on with your day. If it doesn't pass then you're in real trouble.  I HATED it when you guys went, I hate it that you're now where I've been. I know its a life sentence, the thing you so eloquently wrote about Grinder.

MilitaryStories,24qjz8,I_am_Tre,8,Mon May 5 18:40:55 2014 UTC,"Agree w/ Dittybopper. It's like that.  But sometimes it's like this: I'm a nice guy - good natured, friendly. I don't pick fights, but I notice things. Somebody starts in with me, and part of me begins to remember all the myriad ways he could be disassembled, cut short, ended, just like that. Even Mr. Immortal here, who wants me to address his needs.   And maybe I don't hide it as well as I once did. Maybe I just don't give a fuck any more. But lately, I've been backing guys up a step or two. I'm not making faces or being threatening. Just thinking. I know just how immortal you are not. I know so many ways you end, forever, and that's all there is to that. You sure you want to fuck with me like this?  And that's it, Grinder (I like that name for you - Dittybopper sees deep into things). We are all homicides in our hearts - we all trained for it. We know how it works. At some point, you have to stop wondering why you can't fit in with the civilians, and start wondering why the civilians all think they're immortal, safe, secure, not at risk. Who is the crazy person here?  I don't feel crazy any more. I think everyone else is crazy. I suppose that is the very definition of ""crazy,"" but seriously, I stopped giving a shit. I don't think sanity is a majority-rules thing. I think being surprised and hurt and feeling cheated because you're going to die sooner than you thought - if you ever thought you really would die - is nuts. I am the last person you want to invite to a funeral, a baptism or a wedding. I am not a comfort.  And when shit gets real - if it every gets real for the fantasy world of comfort and security most redditors live in - there will be guys like me around. Probably a good thing.    We are broken. It doesn't take a missing foot or arm to be mangled. We'll always have this weight that nobody but our brothers see, and we'll drag it around with us. Maybe it'll make us better people? Maybe it'll make us more kind? Maybe we'll be more empathic?    Not broken. Not rich, not popular, not fun at parties, not stirring conversationalists, not up on the latest fashion, but not broken either. I don't feel like I belong here. You too. But if this place doesn't belong to us, who does it belong to? This is mine. I've staked it out. I own it. You too, Grinder. Nobody else paid as high a price."
MilitaryStories,24qjz8,AnathemaMaranatha,2,Tue May 6 22:53:41 2014 UTC,"I beg to differ. I enjoy talking (mostly listening) to my veteran friends. Some tell me about what they had to do and it is very sad. I wish I had the right words, but I don't think they exist. I always appreciated their perspective and In my limited capacity, I would always do what I could for them. I just wish they could understand how much I do actually appreciate them, because some get a mindset like it is impossible to appreciate them or enjoy their company."
MilitaryStories,24qjz8,I_am_Tre,2,Sat May 10 04:50:19 2014 UTC,"Not sure where we differ. Can't find anything wrong with what you wrote.  I probably should have just deleted my previous post. I was upset that /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit was so down. Kind of a rescue thing I've got going that doesn't rescue anyone. I'm trying my best to say ""you should just cheer up"" without actually saying that, because I know from personal experience that ""you should just cheer up"" is the most discouraging, unpleasant and unhelpful thing you can say to a person who is depressed.  So I decided to be arrogant instead. Yeah, no. Soldiers know some stuff. ER people know some stuff too. Cops ditto. Peace Corps people. Firefighters. Teachers, for sure. Social Workers even. Other stuff that I don't know, don't appreciate, don't have any goddamned idea about. Salty people are leavened through the fluff of society. It's a good thing. Makes things better in the long run.  I think that's the point I was groping at like a horny teenage virgin. What is different about Military types is that ultimately we are/were in the business of killing. And when you machete your way through the jungle of rationalizations and patriotism and history and glory and medals and fallen comrades, in the final analysis all that murder is just wrong. It's a wrong thing. It needs to stop. We need to stop sending people to go do that, facilitate it, supply it, command it.   Nobody knows that better than soldiers. We don't know how to stop the organized potlatch of human lives, we can see and agree with the necessity of war, and still, unlike say an ER nurse, we know that we need to die out. I can't buy into pacifism until they come up with something practical. I admire people who are adamant pacifist, who just say ""DO it!"" But they don't know how to get it done either. A synonym for ""right too soon"" is ""wrong.""   Right now the pacifists are wrong. So here we are. We are/were tasked to do a wrong thing as well as we could, with honor and courage. All the appreciation in the world won't change that. It's a true thing. It's a sane thing to sometimes be sad about that. /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit earned his down time. I should just shut up."
MilitaryStories,24qjz8,AnathemaMaranatha,2,Sat May 10 14:01:40 2014 UTC,"I respect that. Nice teenager metaphor by the way. The only successful true pacifist I have ever heard of was the Buddha. He was a very interesting person, and must have done something right.   I do agree with you though. Being attacked gives a strange mix of adrenaline, rage, and fear. I could not overcome it and it was just a few clowns jumping me. I can't imagine being shot at or the fear of being blown up every day. I think we need soldiers though and will for some time. There is comfort knowing that if shit really gets bad there will be someone who knows how to react instead of giving in to the fear and freezing up like a lot of people do. That can save lives. Maybe it's a sad irony, but the soldier's ability to take lives also allows them to save them and I think that is just as important a job as any other.   I think the fact that you are so aware of the darker side of things is important and really you are the kind of people that can make a difference because you understand. It is about compassion and doing the best you can for people because we all are in it suffering in one or another together.  I'm going to step off my soapbox of probable corniness now. Thanks for trying to make a positive difference and for your understanding."

These were called Sab's, hence Sappers.  When they got to the wall, they would mine underneath of it and stuff the section of the mine full of logs and flammable material.  Later they used gun powder.  They'd set the mine on fire, which would burn the supports out, and that section of wall would collapse, breaching the wall.

So I get home and I am talking to my neighbor, who had been flying that day. Said they were flying nap and some kid yakked all over the back of his bird.  Always thought that was sort of funny. Lot less funny if you're crew and have to clean that shit up.... Just the weird connection between randomly assigned neighbor, randomly assigned CTLT cadet, and their connection over a back-fence beer.  And: Essayons! Another Engineer here."
MilitaryStories,242jcp,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Sun Apr 27 08:15:35 2014 UTC,"Stopped me cold at Essayons. That's the Engineer's motto? Explains a lot.  Incidentally, I think that unless you're on a stage draped with flags and standing behind a podium, essayons translates as ""Let's try,"" rather than ""Let us try"" - as in Hey, what happens if we push this big red button? I dunno. Essayons.  I always wondered why the grunts had such a bi-polar reaction to the arrival of Engineers. Hey guys. The Engineers are here! Steel pots and flack jackets everyone. Move the perimeter out 50 meters in every direction!"
MilitaryStories,242jcp,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Sun Apr 27 16:05:00 2014 UTC,"Pretty much.  The ""Official"" definition would be something  like we can do it!  We did have some pretty long conversations about the reality of Our motto.  The reality was more along these lines.  The Infantry has found yet another ""mine"".  Two of us go out with my demo kit and a detector.  I have the Grunts shut down a major highway, get everybody back a couple hundred meters on either side.  It's just me and Trick, staring at this little thing.  Me:  Doesn't look like an AP mine, does it?  Trick:  Not really.  Doesn't look like anything I've seen.  Me:  I don't wanna wait for a blast window.  Stand back a little.  (Picks up stick.)  I'm just gonna flip it over.  Nope.  It's nothing."
MilitaryStories,242jcp,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Sun Apr 27 19:15:28 2014 UTC,"Dude. Y'all seemed so cool, not exploding mostly every time. Once we put a little distance between us and essayons, we admired the shit out of Engineers."
MilitaryStories,242jcp,Dittybopper,4,Sun Apr 27 22:59:03 2014 UTC,"Cool, huh?  I've always felt the Sappers were the forgotten bastard children of the combat arms.  In brigade formations we were stuck between the MP's and MI.  Seriously?  The M-fucking-P's.  In movies and books, no mention.  Ever.  Maybe a paragraph.  The Artillery gets more love than we ever got.  The poor dumb dipshits going out into the minefield, on purpose.  Okay, I'll admit that it turned out there weren't any plastic AP mines with almost no metallic content in the area I was sweeping.  Cleaning up US dropped cluster bombs with any incredibly high failure rate that turned one of the guys in Third Platoon into a one legged blind man at the age of twenty.  I'm glad somebody admired the Engineers.  It actually means a lot coming from you.    We did get to do some really cool shit.  I mean, huge shots, almost blew ourselves up a few times as we got more reckless.  Big demo was  totally carefree, because you knew that if you fucked up you'd never know you fucked up.  Maybe you'd see a bright flash before being atomized.  They might find a dog-tag to send home with the check, but you wouldn't feel it.  This is one of my favorite pictures from that time period.  That area was called ""Ambush Alley"".  I got called out there after everything was over.  They'd opened up on a humvee full of Grunts, and got schooled pretty well.  No friendlies were hit.  We found a few sandals that the Haji's had left behind while unassing the spot once they'd realized their mistake.  A few magazines.  The brush was all shot up, split limbs and stuff, but no blood trails.  The RPG gunner had missed the truck of our boys, and almost hit his own guys.  They weren't very good at that point in time.  The way they were set up, they were actually shooting at each other.  The RPG was most likely un-detonated because they didn't take the safety off.  That was pretty common.  They actually mortared Charlie Co. with un-fused mortars, once.    I forgot to mention that the actual, real-world translation that we unanimously agreed upon was, Fuck It."
MilitaryStories,242jcp,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Mon Apr 28 00:27:02 2014 UTC,"They actually mortared Charlie Co. with un-fused mortars, once.   My favorite kind of mortar round. After that, I'd take Chi-com 82mm. They didn't even try to etch the metal or shape the charge. Most of the shrapnel went into the ground. Been bounced around by Chi-com 82 rounds - blown down a bunker stairway once. I'd resent it, but if that had been a Russian round, I wouldn't be here to tell the tale. In particular, this tale:  Here's my EOD story. My grunts decided that since I was the crater analysis guy, I would surely know what the hell this giant jungle bomb-thingy was. Then every time I tried to come close to it, they'd all start yelling ""Don't touch it!"" They were all sure it was booby-trapped, because of the coffee cans with grenade spoons. And the strange marking made them just as sure the thing was a nuke because why not?  Anyway, the Engineers choppered in, took a look at it, told us it ain't no thang, and shooed us out of the blast zone. They were stone-calm, cool and collected, and they weren't gonna tell us what that goddamned thing was.  11B: ""Is it a nuke? I bet it's a nuke!  Essayons: ""Big enough to be a nuke, for sure.""  Arty Guy: ""It's not a nuke. Cluster bomb, right? Maybe a daisy cutter?  Essayons: ""Hard to say, sir. We'll tend to it.""  Yeah, pull the other one. Even so, I thought you'd like to know that it wasn't just me that had a kind of slack-jaw admiration for the Engineers. There was a whole company of us. They just blew that nukish motherfucker up. There's probably a jungle full of mutant giant leeches and fire ants there now."
MilitaryStories,242jcp,OuttaSightVegemite,3,Mon Apr 28 01:36:39 2014 UTC,"My guess, based on your description, would be a thermobaric weapon in the first generation of use.  The coffee can things with spoons would be the initiators, multiple ones for redundancy.  It would make sense to have a delay of initiation that let the gas, or whatever, diffuse enough to be effective.  A dust initiator works the same way, but on a smaller scale.  If you want to collapse a building on itself, you use a dust initiator.  There's a formula for how much sawdust or flour or whatever that you cover the floors of the building with.  It has to be soft walled, with all doors an windows sealed.  The initiating charge should be centered in the structure.  Long story short, the charge detonates, the shockwave throws the fine dust in the air before it burns.  When the dust flashes it uses up the available oxygen, causes a rapid decompression, and ideally pulls the walls in and the roof down.  I never got to do that, unfortunately.  Our Platoon Daddy, who'd been an instructor at Sapper Leader Course and a Gulf War vet, said that the only time he'd done it they blew one of the walls out and burned the house down.  Anyhoo...In theory, it would make sense for a daisy cutter to operate on a delay, and be humungous because of compressed gas.  Kinda like a shaped charge, or HEAT round.  If you let it do its thing, it's a nasty bitch.  If you blow it in one good shot, it ain't shit.    We got banned from SA-2's because our Third Herd dumbfucks demo'd one and sent it corkscrewing into the sky.  It came back down near a refinery and the warhead detonated.  They'd put the charges down near the propellant instead of on both the warhead and propellant.  Any rocket, you put a charge on the warhead, and another for the propellant, with the det-cord running from the initiator to the warhead to the propellant last, otherwise you get kick outs.  Third got a big fucking kick out, and we had to drag 40' missiles to Baghdad International because they were stupid.  That's also why Homeboy got his foot blown off and a face full of frag.  His Squad leader had them picking up bomblets with fucking shovels.  Our platoon didn't touch them.  We blew them in place.  That motherfucker ended up getting promoted.  He stood by, telling his guys to do idiotic shit, and got a promotion and a bronze fucking bullshit star for it.  Off topic again."
MilitaryStories,2402yv,moving0target,13,Sat Apr 26 02:05:35 2014 UTC,"Hi OP,  Well told. There's a lot of information there in what looks like a short story. I was in Vietnam. There are a couple more guys here who were.  I'd like to parse what you wrote out a bit, but I need more info. I don't want you to doxx yourself, just a little background. First, is your Dad still living? Your Mom too? Ballpark, how old are you? You working, or in school? Kids of your own?  I'll tell you something a VA worker told me when I had gone all drama and imagined I wanted to die and leave my two daughters better off. ""You can't leave 'em. You're their Dad. Your choices are to be a dead-Dad, a drunk-Dad, an angry-Dad, an absent-Dad, a sad-Dad, a scary-Dad, and a bunch of other kinds of Dad. What you don't get to do is stop being their Dad. It's a done deal. The option you want is not on the table."" So he's your Dad. I don't imagine he feels good about that. He may think he's blaming you for his disappointment. He isn't.   ""Dad"" is the most under-trained, OJT, ad hoc thing that will ever happen to you. Your training for it has been lousy - not your Dad's fault really - he had the same lousy training, and he was hit with Dad while he was busy processing - or drowning - other stuff. Not looking for fault here.   Y'see, all that information you have about him is your information, not his. He gave you that, but you own it. You're PTSD as much as he was. Again, no fault. Just kind of rotating the table.  So more please. I served with your Dad. Maybe we can clear some things up."

I'm in my thirties, been married for a few years, and have a 5 year old daughter.    I work full time, but recently took a lower-paying job that allows me to spend more time with my family.  That's one of the many things I learned from my childhood.  I can sacrifice a nicer car, a nicer dwelling and such.  My kid doesn't have to be seen and not heard.  She a kid.  She's going to bounce around and make noise.  It's alright within reason.  She's well adjusted and disciplined.  All parents make mistakes.  I'm trying very hard to learn from the ones my parents made  You've suggested to me before to ""sick that little girl on him.""  I think it's slowly working.    My father and I love each other in our own distant way.  I respect him.  We talk about shared hobbies and the like.  We just don't talk about the emotional stuff.  Mom is the one I'm closer to.  We can talk about just about anything.  I didn't have a bad childhood.  I always had a place to live and food to eat.  I don't blame him.  I've heard the words about what he went though, but I have almost no life experience that can make me feel what he went through.  Without that, I can't really judge him.  As a teenager, I was an asshole.  Probably as much of an asshole as most teens, but still an asshole.  Dad was an exemplary student all through school and earned a degree.  I got crappy grade from about 8th grade on.  I have a high IQ (for what that's worth) so the only reason for poor performance was laziness and lack of motivation.  Later in my teens,  I became the first person in several generations to drop out of college.  I don't think he's disappointed in me as a human being, but I certainly gave him a laundry list of actions to be disappointed over.  Thanks for the reply, as always.  You strike me as a real ""salt of the earth"" kind of man so I always appreciate your wisdom."
MilitaryStories,2402yv,Heir-O-sol_Art,3,Sun Apr 27 02:38:48 2014 UTC,"Ah. Found the thread. Sorry I didn't recognize you. I read the posts. I never seem to notice the user names. I'm a complete sucker for /u/WhyYouNeverCanSpotaTrollDumbass and his sad-kitty pictures.  Okay, so we talked all this out. I grok you want to tell your Dad's stories. You're both proud of him and conflicted about him. I'll leave the conflict to be resolved by that little girl - she's got the chops for it.  If you're telling stories... Here's the part I always hated about my stories. I'd tell 'em to my children, they'd leave my mouth the truth, and enter their ears as a lie. There's this damned Greek chorus following me around singing sad/dramatic background music and flashing scenes on a backscreen from Platoon and Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket and The Deer Hunter. I'm sure you visualized your Dad rescuing your Mother like every action-movie you've ever seen - clean fistfight, a dirty move by the bad guy, good guy recovers and makes manly mince-meat out of villain. Yeah, no. Stuff like that only happens in the movies where you can control the lighting and choreograph out all the ugly aspects of real physical violence. Most fight are eye-gouging things that involve a lot of rolling around, and someone ends up shirtless, puking vomit, blood and teeth in an alley, with his pants down around his knees.  Likewise Vietnam. You could dial it back some, even the PTSD stuff. Really man, it wasn't that bad. Really. No dis to your Dad's experience, but it wasn't an all the time thing. The only thing I remember being a 24/7/365 experience was chow and finding a quiet place to shit. Think that wasn't traumatic? I commend the collected works of /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit on his experiences at As Samawah, Iraq. I know he related a bunch of stuff, but the thing that got my PTSD up and running was the reminder of the daily problem of finding a nice quiet place to take a dump that has not already been discovered by some legion of the legions of soldiers around me looking for exactly the same place. Every day. I had forgotten that. But my PTSD didn't.  And the effect of my crapulous trauma 45 years down the timeline? Even though I forgot why, I shut the bathroom door everytime. I don't shut it because I'm shy. I shut it because I get a rush of happiness and accomplishment commandeering that porcelain and tile and the privacy of that door. I fucking love it. Forgot why. But I still do. Makes my goddamned day. For 45 years. And /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit is my best friend once a day for reminding me about why I take so much pleasure in closing that door.  Trauma is trauma. Drama is drama. I enjoy overdramatizing my Vietnam-generated love affair with a private dump. But trauma can become drama after a while, especially if you take it seriously and to heart. Time for your Dad to lighten up. He's got granpa duty, and that's a serious business that should require all his attention. As for you OP, keep in mind that your Dad was ten years younger than you are now when all this Vietnam crap happened. He's kinda stuck in a twenty-something mindset.   Not you OP. You're doing well. But you need to treat your Dad's trauma as what it is - the reaction of a younger man to some startling and hard things. You need to be the older guy. You are the older guy.   I should talk. I turned on the iPod this morning as I was sitting down to write this. First song up - Dixie Chicks ""Travelin' Soldier."" I had to stop and sing along and feel sad for that poor little picolo player. 45 years ago. How dumb is that? Yeah, that dumb. It's all in the past. It's just dumb stuff now - fodder for stories.  Little girls now... I had two. They're your age OP, and the two of them are busy being stone-cold great and healing their parents back up the timeline. Girls can time-travel. I know it's impossible, but you wait and see."

Climbing up a tree adorned with entrails to retrieve a pack to check it for intel, seeing a guy evaporated by a beehive round, taking human lives, having his best friend die in his arms while he could do nothing about it; even though those occurred over a fraction of the time he as in country, I imagine they'd make an impression.  As for the altercation with my uncle, it wasn't even a fight.  Dad was 145 pounds soaking wet (not that his college had monsoon season) and 5'9"".  My uncle was 6'3"" and at least 250.  It wasn't a fight.  It was a highly one sided lesson.     Dad has always always been my hero.  My friends in grade school used to complain about me always talking about him.  This sub has given me the opportunity to tell his stories which need to be recorded somewhere.  It also gives me a chance to vent.  He has gotten better over the years.  He no longer attacks my uncle and he doesn't wake up at the slightest sound in combat mode.  He went to a few reunions with his platoon.  Those guys practically worshiped him...and practically threatened my life when I made a snide teenage remark.  He also wrote a novel based on his experience.

MilitaryStories,23zf2k,Shpadoinkles,13,Fri Apr 25 21:16:13 2014 UTC,"The week before Christmas 1966, 51st SOC, Torii Station Okinawa. I never enjoyed Christmas anyway, too commercial and those songs just grate on my last nerve. This particular Christmas I am in the dumps, a mix of depression, non specific anger and generally just ""fuck it.""  On the way back from Operations after pulling a Mid I spot this scraggly tree branch along the path. A light goes off ""I could make a Christmas tree out of that ugly MF!"" I take it up to the four-man bay, my home. I search for and locate an old flower pot down by the Mess Hall and fill it with gravel. Back in the room I plant the desolate looking branch and began decorating. I undo an 18 pack of gum, put the twisted wrappers and foil on, I go down to the orderly room and grab a handful of rubbers out of the jar. I festoon the tree with condoms, step back and ""yeah, that'll do.""  So what the fuck, I have a tree, it is ugly as sin, looks like it was at Nagasaki. This calls for a drink so I break out the quart of bourbon in my locker (we were allowed) and put a 12"" tape on my Ampex tape machine, rock of course.  Time passes and the whiskey gives me a brilliant flash, I make a sign for the tree.  ""Merry Fucking Christmas and Happy New Fear!""  Well hell, I thought, it looks great; and the sign did indeed reflect my feelings. The next morning the company 1st Shirt is doing a walk through wishing everyone a Merry Christmas, he steps into the bay and greets all with his wish - then his face kinda goes screwy, his eyes harden and he looks at me.   ""Full field gear including your weapon in 15 minutes; in my office and bring that abomination Specialist!"" pointing disdainfully.  After a questioning period about why I had done what I had and its ""meaning"" I received an ass chewing worthy of any senior US army NCO. Something concerning company morale and the meaning of Christmas. Then the fun began with me double timing around the barracks in full gear with my weapon at port arms. This I did until the 1st Shirt got tired, and by then the bourbon stench leaching out the pores of my skin was too much even for me."

Well fuck. So instead I stood up.   They should've given that fiberglass antenna a medal.

MilitaryStories,23ti1l,AnathemaMaranatha,5,Thu Apr 24 17:24:49 2014 UTC,"That's some crazy shit.  The most I ever saw anybody lose it was when we were living in Baghdad.    Our platoon was in a two bedroom house.  Two squads had their own rooms, and the third had a room sort of thing between the foyer/confiscated weapons room, and the LT&PSG&SL's room/radio watch room/platoon common area/briefing room.  I don't know how we never had any fist fights.  Probably would have been better if there had been.  We heard yelling and bitching coming from the not-a-real-room squad's room.  A lot of 'Fuck you!' and stuff like that. I went to investigate, maybe diffuse the situation.  Another team leader and one of the squad leaders was there by then, trying to diffuse the situation.  One of the two in the shouting match picked up an M-4 and chambered a round, held it at the low ready.  The other was saying, 'Fuckin shoot me, then!'  Whoa...buddy.  We managed to calm everything down, and swept it under the rug.  Honestly, though, he would have shot him.  He would have regretted it, but he would have shot him if it weren't for the family.  Crazy shit."
MilitaryStories,23ti1l,SoThereIwas-NoShit,5,Fri Apr 25 04:39:59 2014 UTC,"Yes he would have shot him, this I know. Michael Herr in his book about VN Dispatches (one of the best) remarked that going crazy in VN was built into the tour - frankly I believe it is true for any war. I witnessed several incidents of guys going nuts and other weird shit. Take for instance that same squad who lived on the rooftop of that building, Carl's squad. They were slowly poisoning their LT with rat poison. They would volunteer to bring him his chow from the mess tent. But before delivering it would take a bar of the rat poison and shave it into his food. I learned of what they were up to but did I report them, no. They were my guns, they would have killed me though if it came out that I had said anything. What did that make me? By that point, close to the end of my 365 days, I had become like that fellow with the M4 you tell of. I just didn't give a shit anymore, my feelings were shut down. It was like what do I care if they poison one of their own, frankly I didn't care, I had no empathy remaining for anyone really. It had been given up to the war and it took the death of my mother eight years later for it to return. It is weird to admit that now and to know that I did nothing. That isn't really me."

One decided to burn his hands while he was on guard duty one night.  Not cover them in gas and set them on fire, burn.  He took his cigarette and held the cherry against the back of his hand for each month we'd been there, and continued each following month.  Not super nuts, but weird.  The other guy had gotten himself into a drivers slot by being the one most suited.  He drove aggresively, but not over the top.  We had our humvees at that point in time.  The un-armored troop carrier types.  One for each squad.  He'd found a dead kitten in a pile of garbage, and brought it back to our house.  He wrapped wire around its neck and tied it to a 'leash' that was tied to the rear bumper of the truck.  He was one of my kids, and the first I found out about it was when we were loading up to roll out.  ""Dude?  What the fuck is that?""  ""That's Fluffy.  My cat.""  The weird part, looking back on it, is that nobody thought it was that weird.  Nobody even said anything.  'Whatever.  Just drag a dead kitten, that you've named, around behind us.'  Fluffy didn't last very long.    We got back in one day, and he said, ""Aww, where'd my fuckin' cat go?""  Of course, on the extreme end of things was the dude from First Platoon who shot himself in the head."

We had a guy who worked in our motor pool, he couldn't hack the secret work, being an intercept operator so, since he was cleared for TS he was retained in the unit as a sort of gofer and motor pool lizard. He would often take the truck or a jeep and go to the river where Vietnamese women would wash them and polish his knob in the bargain. He kept catching STDs even after being given a direct order to use protection. The final time he caught something it turned out to be untreatable, a monster strain of Clap. His balls swol up the size of eggplants and to see him walk was hilarious because not only were they huge they hurt terribly. I only saw him the once since I wasn't around our unit all that much. I was told after returning from the field for a refit that the doctors had performed an experimental operation on him that involved splitting his urethra and scraping it, he came back from the hospital in major pain, ultimately the operation failed and he was told his dick would never function the same again. He shot himself with a .45 pistol."

Quite suddenly, two VC came trotting up the trail, completely oblivious to the GI's.  One of dad's ""favorite"" guys in the squad decided that he wanted to be a badass and hose them down.  Problem was, he fail to seat the magazine.  The chambered round went off well wide of the targets.

He was ambushed buy a VC doing the old breath through a straw trick while lying underwater in a rice paddy. Waited for the gunner to pass (he was second in line to the pointman) and rose up and shot him in the back and then fired on the point. He himself died soon after.

Aggressiveness, as you said isn't a bad thing if it doesn't put your buddies in danger.  Dad and his AG used to walk point.  They'd sprint a 100 or so meters ahead of the rest of the unit, wait until they caught up and repeat.  Dad could smell an ambush a mile away so the technique was very effective.  Incidentally, he was walking the perimeter late one night and Mr. ""I'll Use My M16 As A Water Hose"" who put his squad in danger, was kicked back against a tree with headphones on full blast smoking a joint.  A knife over the carotid and a few whispered threats later, a replacement guard was found and the guy was gone the next day."

Little stuff like that, you know, the shit you need to know.   Apparently the only things that change are the environment.  We didn't have to look for snakes or nasty bugs, except in Saudi because there were cobras, and I never heard of anybody dealing with a camel spider.  One of the most interesting things I watched was a couple of SF dudes digging out, and killing, cobra's at night in Ar Ar.  That was kind of a trip.  I made my coffee with, brace yourself, a canteen cup and C-4.  My Mom sent me whole bean coffee, so I ground it by wrapping it up in my t-shirt and smashing it with mud-bricks.  Then I'd scrape the 'grounds' into an empty plastic one-liter water bottle.  An eighth block of C-4 would get the canteen cup boiling, and I'd use my Gerber pliers to pick it up, wrap my t-shirt around the water bottle, and pour the boiling water in.  Steam shot out of the top, the plastic shrank, and I'd screw the lid on.  Shake it up, leave it to sit for about a smoke's worth of time, and then pour the coffee off of the grounds back into the canteen cup.  Good morning!  I'd like to read ""A Single Day""."

Some say putting egg shells in causes the ground to settle quicker. ?.   I never did write the story, but now that I thought of it again I remember a bit about building bunkers too.

I (very calmly and in a nice enlisted to officer way) again explained that we were doing classified work in support of his command and added that I was not allowed to detail the work for security reasons and on a ""cleared TS SI need to know basis only."" He exploded, said all sorts of foul shit and threatened to have us put under guard and removed from his FSB.

I wanted Sidney again (I had two R&Rs), I got Penang, Malaysia. Enlisted pukes didn't get First Choice in these matters. So be it. Fucking Kuala Lumpur rocked! I checked into an extremely nice and well ran hotel. They even had a ""pick one"" lineup in the lobby. I chose a sloe-eyed little country looking gal, quite beautiful, I liked her so much I paid a weeks rent for her. She could converse a few words in the Kings English, British accent and all. We toured the town, including the open air souk where all manner of merchandise was laid out for sale, including gold and golden objects, interesting place. Of course we hit some night life to - my money flowed, I was skinned to the bone but who cared. It was just money and who knew if I'd ever get to spend anymore.   She knew a trick, her mother taught it to her she told me. She could use the muscles in her vagina to massage one's member during intercourse. Fabulous. We spent a lot of time in our hotel room.   All in all, a great time - flying back was no fun, I was full of dread and by then I had had enough of war."

We had actual responsibilities that were more important than some bullshit in Qatar, even though I ended up getting a couple of sweet rugs(one actually has papers).  This was October or September, so things were leaning to the opposite side of good.  I wasn't even supposed to be in the Army at that point in time and had been offered the option of leaving that August.  I turned that option down.

MilitaryStories,230ptm,Military_Jargon_Bot,4,Sat Apr 19 02:58:25 2014 UTC,"Ever been on a Boeing 777 with a rifle and a pistol?    Kinda. I was with our advance party out of Fort Carson - 30-40 people. We got on an AF KC-141 (?) on Carson (Buckley? - don't remember). They had two pallets of airline seats on the bottom of the cargo bay. The rest of the cargo bay was AF utilitarian - no bulkheads - just other pallets and piles of boxes and strange containers. One window that we could reach by weaving through the other pallets. We had overhead lighting.  So we sat on these cushy, but narrow, airline seats, six in a row, in our new jungle fatigues and jungle boots, with our helmets on our laps, M14's between our knees, all the rest of our gear in duffle bags piled up at the rear of the seat pallets. We were in the cavernous bay of an AF cargo plane, strangely lit up, no place to go.   It was like a Twilight Zone episode. Put us on a theater stage, wrap an audience around us, and we all would've gone to the Tony Awards instead of Vietnam. Five hours to Anchorage, eight more to Yakota and fuel. More hours to Saigon. Except when we finally debarked, we were in Danang. Surprise ending.  Surreal. The Ante-chamber of War, brought to you by Weird-Demons Inc.  R&R was the opposite. You reminded me of how unencumbered I felt the whole time coming and going, how used I had gotten to carrying stuff, how light I was. We were in khakis, low-quarter shoes, no other stuff except a wallet full of money. Turns out that was enough.  They processed us at the R&R center in Sydney in the early morning. I chose a hotel in Woolamoola (sp?) on the basis of its ad flyer - it was by the ocean. Cabs were lined up outside. I got to the hotel at what? 0800? They were ready for me. I was ushered to my room, where a guy was waiting with a measuring tape. He took measurements, waist, leg, arms, shoulders, then told me in Australian that he'd be right back - I think that's what he said. They tell you 'strine is English, but I have my doubts.  He came back in like 15 minutes with a pile of civilian clothes. Had me try 'em on. He tsked and tutted and selected some for me, put others aside, handed me a bill. Which I paid. He said something in 'strine, and I said ""You're welcome,"" and I never saw him again. And there I was in civies in a hotel room in Woolamoola in fuckin' Australia at 0840 in the morning. WTF? How the hell did that just happen? Someone bring me up to speed, please.  I decided I wanted a chocolate milkshake. No idea why. I walked out on the beach boardwalk - which was just coming to life - and found a place that was open called a ""Milk Bar."" Close enough.  I should explain that I was there in 1968 when Australia was trying to stay white. White people had stolen the continent first, and they were worried that excessive numbers of darker people from SE Asia would come and ruin everything. So they were aggressively recruiting immigrants from the white places of the world - they were pretty desperate for more white people. They weren't just recruiting from the nice white places of the world, like England, Germany and all the Scandinavian countries except maybe Finland. They were taking anyone who could pass as white, actual Caucasians, Greeks, Italians, Turks even.  (They've since changed their minds about all of this, and Oz is a lovely country with all shades of munchkins now.)  Anyway, I went into the Milk Bar and asked the nice lady (who was white) behind the counter for a milkshake. She answered in 'strine something that I didn't quite catch, but she began preparing something that looked like a milkshake, so I just nodded. Sure enough it was a milkshake when she was finished. She offered it to me, and I took out a bunch of the funny money they had given us at the R&R center, but no. She wanted something else. I said, ""Excuse me?"" She spoke 'strine at me again. No idea what she said.   Okay enough. I wanted my milkshake. I spoke my best English, parsed and enunciated every word. ""Excuse me. I do not understand your accent. Could you please speak slooooowly?""  She backed up two steps and stared at me. Then she spoke in lovely English, slowly, pausing between each word, ""Are - you - Yugo - slavian?""  And that was it. Everything got funny. I laughed like an idiot, and she looked like she was thinking about calling the cops. ""No!"" I said, ""I'm an American! Could you please speak the Queen's English to me?""  She gave me a hesitant smile, and then did just that. All the English-speaking people are cousins - we all speak movie English, if we are called upon to do so. Pretty soon all accents will die out. But Oz will be the last outpost of local dialect, for sure.  Huh. This story got long. Sorry. I story-bombed my own thread. One weird thing after another, and then it's funny. I can live with that."

I had been in one platoon that was broken up after a bunch of us were accused of hazing (some of us including me were falsely accused and had to request trial) and put into another platoon that was more of a boys' club than anything. They quietly got rid of me when company decided to set up a mobile platoon for resupplies to outlying patrol bases and I became his driver.   He had been back and forth in Iraq and Afghanistan as a machine gunner a half dozen times since he enlisted and spent time instructing at the School of Infantry after that. I learned more about infantry tactics and how to handle yourself as a person from him in a seven month deployment than I had in my previous two years as a rifleman. He regularly encouraged me to steal things we needed when the supplybros were jerking me around and I saw him on at least two occasions cover a corner with an M9 in one hand and an M4 in the other watching both lanes at the same time.
MilitaryStories,22wt8t,oh_three_dum_dum,1 point,Tue Apr 15 13:04:45 2014 UTC,"It's not stealing, it's tactical acquisition.  Was his name Garcia by any chance?  My senior drill sergeant was SFC Garcia, and he was by far the best NCO I've ever encountered.  He led strictly by example, he explained himself, his decisions, and the politics of the Army, and he never ever gave up on anyone.  A couple of times he got up in the middle of the night and drove down to Benning from wherever he lived to talk to some of our guys who were thinking of trying to get out, or go AWOL.  We only lost one soldier to a recycle, and that guy - unfortunately - just couldn't be saved.  After we lost him, SDS Garcia talked to us and basically said that even though he was a shitbag, we still owe it to him as a member of our platoon to do our damndest to help him become a better soldier.  This is not to say that he wasn't your typical in-your-face, ass-chewing drill sergeant.  He absolutely was, and if you screwed up you would know it.  But at the same time there was never any question that he was on our side."

It ain't called a Herky Jerky for nothing.  I honestly have to say that a C-130 was my favorite to jump.  I always had the best opening.  C-17's were great to ride, especially if we got to do an in-flight-rig, but I had twists every fucking time.   Unfortunately for her she managed to pull her reserve chute and it began spilling out of her pack.   Holy Bejeebus.  I've been on some fucked up jumps, but never seen that.  Was it a hollywood jump?  One of our guys, I was on a different bird but my roommate was his jump buddy, did a backflip kinda thing out the door.  It was winter time, shitty weather.  Homeboy was in front of him, they were rushing the door.  He said the bird powered down and powered back up, they staggered backwards into each other, and then got slammed forwards(towards the rear of the aircraft, and the door).  He said dude spun all the way around,  slammed into the side of the door as the bird dropped, and he went ass over tea kettle, backwards, into the night.  He managed to keep from getting wrapped up in his static line, somehow.  Sounds like you learned a lot, real quickly.  I never even thought about the Air Force side of things.

I hadn't actually considered the effects of turbulence on a jump. I have no official training, but I got kicked out of a C-130 (maybe a C-123?) twice on practice jumps. An ARVN airborne unit was going to a combat drop into NVA-occupied territory. I was game, tho' I thought approaching the enemy ass-first was, as the doctors say, contraindicated.   My practice jumps were from 3K feet, if memory serves, with a drag-line to open my chute. It was from a one-plane formation. I didn't like it.  The combat drop would've been what?... seven, eight planes in formation? The way they were getting me out of that airplane was two guys walking me quickly to the end of the ramp and pushing (kicking the second time) me over the lip. Hadn't considered turbulence or crashing into some part of the plane as I fell out. My god. I had no idea.  The combat jump got cancelled. We went in on the Khe Sanh airstrip. Jesus.

I hated rousting people who were just trying to hunker down, raise children and get a crop in. It's unnerving.  I remembered remembering that about 15 years later when I was DAing in a small town and wrote my first search warrant affidavit for the local Sheriff. He invited me along. I was all ready for it - had gloves, made sure there was a Deputy Sheriff near me at all times so I wouldn't be a witness to any discovery of evidence.  We went to a house, kind of like my house, a family house. A very upset woman and her about six year old son were standing outside being prevented from going inside -going home - by a large sheriff. Inside, it looked kind of like my house still, kids toys, dropped magazines, the detritus of everyday living.  Our sheriffs weren't like city cops - they did a thorough search, but put things back in place. They didn't wreck things. Even so....  I was standing in the hallway with the UnderSheriff. She had a clipboard, and was inventorying things as they were brought to her. I was feeling a little queasy. She must have noticed.  ""You know what I do after one of these things?"" she said. Um, yeah sure. Probably went to a bar with the whole Sheriff's Office to celebrate putting some dirtbag drug dealer away and laugh about the sex toys and porn we found in the bedroom.   I was trying to think of a nice way to turn down an invite. For sure, I wasn't in the mood. But first... ""No, what do you do?"" I replied.  ""I go home and clean house.""  Yep. That's exactly what I wanted to do. Didn't know it until she said it. It turns out I was feeling some urgency about getting that done.  Searches suck. Free-fire zones are the way to go. Not as much mandatory housekeeping going on in your head.  But Dude, The Euphrates! Wah! I remember seeing the Nile, and saying in my head That's TheNile! That's where everything started! Yep.

I too have thought on this and that was my conclusion. It seems as gear gets lighter more is added until that 60-70 pound limit is again reached. Typically a soldier will not go into battle with all of that as a lot of it is left with support unit to care for prior to going out the wire. So, issue MRE's over C-rations and you save a lot of weight, what happens... the grunt loads up more ammunition."

You're right about Army foot powder. I now take Army foot powder everywhere I go. Just in case there's sockpocalypse again, y'know?"

How to properly burn shit, or shit outside of the wire (tactical bowel evacuation).  How to powder ones feet without vomiting.  All of that seemingly inane stuff that's the bulk of daily life.

MilitaryStories,22dqkh,oberon,6,Mon Apr 7 16:47:48 2014 UTC,"Looking good man, night movement, hummm sounds like all sorts of fun.   In vietnam you had two seasons, the dry one and the really wet one. Both did bad things to your feet if you let them. So yes, you kept at it to keep them working, maintained your feet. The dry season caused them to sweat excessively and grow rashes with no names, so you changed socks and used that powder. The wet season was hopeless it seemed, I guess it was the worst. Everything rotted, everything had that funky moldy damp stink, feet and boots too. When you had the chance you took your boots off (never at night) and dried them as best you could but in 100% humidity they never really dried, nothing did. Try always, always, to have a fresh pair of socks on hand and that powder did work well."

MilitaryStories,225rt9,SoThereIwas-NoShit,9,Fri Apr 4 02:42:27 2014 UTC,"Believe it or no your story just got better for me, it seemed to turn a corner somehow, slow a bit and become clearer. It made me remember too those days and nights of not getting any sleep and how that just killed my ass and put in a kind of neverland. I don't miss that. For years after returning I was a blank on where I'd been in Vietnam, I could remember the smallest detail of incidents but not the where of them. We moved so often, never stopped really except now and then and that is where I could remember ""place."" Gradually those remembered places served as sort of memory anchors and lead to other places which eventually widened into what I now call my vietnam. I'm still working on that though. There was one incident I deeply suppressed also, a total blank until four decades later when nothing special caused it to come flooding back. Fuck that, it could have stayed buried as far as I am concerned.   An hours ""sleep"" does you no good, a body needs four hours to really rest. You must have been exhausted, beaten to hell. No wonder it is a blur to you, you described it so well and I know that condition and that place.   Looking forward to more... you're doing GREAT.   ADD: pumping in that cat analogy was brilliant!"
MilitaryStories,225rt9,Dittybopper,7,Fri Apr 4 20:39:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks.  During the time we spent there, I remember thinking it was about three or four days.  A year or so later, the first time I tried to write all of this down and my recollection was far better, I spent a few days pulling up everything I could remember.  I was able to recall day, and night, and the few times I actually got sleep, not counting the rooftop experience above or similar situations.  It came out to eleven days, and about twenty hours of sleep.  I don't know how accurate that is, and never will.  I don't know how we were even functioning.  I'm surprised we didn't have more friendly fire incidents.  The two that I was involved in weren't the only ones, but I think the only one with caualties.  It was literally the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.  Nothing will ever come close, and I don't want it to.  The fact that we were even functional blows my fuckin' mind.  After that, I never felt the need to prove myself to anyone ever again.    I really appreciate your reading, and the feedback.  It's been a while since I've actually written anything a couple of times a week, and this is the place that's getting me to do it.  I feel like I'm getting my Voice back.  Anathema said something about, ""You write, and then see what it is.""  I've always found that to be true, but I think it also hones your writing Voice.  I'm not trying to win any awards, but I've been away from Art for too long, and it feels good to be creating again.  Thank you.  You're helping me do this."
MilitaryStories,225rt9,Dittybopper,4,Sat Apr 5 01:09:45 2014 UTC,"If I have in any way aided you then I am proud of that. I believe what you are doing is important, I want you to continue.   Jeez, sleep, I love it and hate it. Love feeling rested, hate the time sleep takes away from being active. The longest period I spent awake in Vietnam was five days and nights during the May 5th Offensive following Tet68. Other that that it was briefer periods of no sleep. My days were generally 18-20 hours. As I have mentioned I was with the infantry in the field for the bulk of my tour so I know how you guys suffered from not only sleep deprivation but through plenty of other crap both military and enemy related.   Your voice is getting stronger, I can tell. You are one who has something to say. Glad you are into art, I was a designer/illustrator most of my life. I too must be involved in something creative to feel right, just gotta do it. Currently I build flintlock rifles as my outlet, much fun and they go BOOM!  Cheers"
MilitaryStories,225rt9,Dittybopper,3,Sat Apr 5 02:19:57 2014 UTC,"Flintlocks, eh?  I'd be curious to see a picture or ten.  I've always wanted to get a Hawkins Rifle.  I kinda had a thing for Mountain Men and Ninjas and Paratroopers when I was a kid.   I recently tried my hand at building a self bow, I didn't have the heart to kill a big healthy tree, and put some hours into it before I broke it.  I was testing its flex, and took it a little too far.  It broke pretty spectacularly, so it was definitely good yew wood.  I might have to take an old tree this winter, get a few good staves, and try again.  Seriously, I'd love to see one of your rifles, and pictures of the progress.  Cheers to you.  ADDITION:  I wasn't infantry, but a lowly combat engineer (Sapper sounds so much cooler).  We just worked quite closely with our Grunts.  Five days is no bueno.  As far as generally having 18-20 hour days, that's a motherfucker.  When we'd gotten settled down in Baghdad it seemed like things came in waves.  We'd have absolutely nothing to do other than guard duty, so we'd make improvements to our house, kill flies, throw random things in the burn pit to see what happened, jerk off, etc.  Other times the Op-Tempo would be high and we'd spend the day running UXO response or being on QRF, interspersed with guard duty and manual labor setting up Hesco barriers or working on bunkers, or presence patrols, followed by curfew patrols at night, followed by cordon searches that started at 0300 and ended around noon.  Baghdad in the summer of '03 was a strange place, but that's another story or two.  I think I'm gonna see if I can get us through the rest of As Samawah.  If you want to read a whitewashed and patriotic account of it, Karl Zinnsmeister wrote a book called 'Boots On The Ground'.  My PL at the time is on the cover, and I'm in one of the photos of the bonfire, but you can't see me."
MilitaryStories,225rt9,AnathemaMaranatha,6,Sun Apr 6 21:08:56 2014 UTC,Here's one I completed last fall. Currently I am working on two Tennessee mountain style and after that a Hawken in 62 caliber.

MilitaryStories,225rt9,Dittybopper,6,Mon Apr 7 22:15:04 2014 UTC,"My son completed a self bow recently, made of Osage Orange. Turned out pretty nice. Currently he is working on some hawks, he sent a pix of one he forged and it looks like it will file into a nice hawk. I have so progress pictures of the rifle I show below but they are still on my phone, been too lazy to cross load to this computer... That sucks to put so much work into a bow and have it break, do another one. Making these things is relaxing and provides insight into how our ancestors lived and worked, that is fun."
MilitaryStories,225rt9,Dittybopper,4,Sun Apr 6 23:35:26 2014 UTC,"The funny thing is that I expected it to break.  Everybody said 'Why are you doing it if you think it's going to break?'  I didn't want to kill a nice tree when I have no idea what I'm doing.  I took a small sickly yew, I'm in Northern California, with the idea that maybe I'd make a working bow, but that I'd at least get an idea of how to work the wood without killing a good tree for nothing.  The way that stave broke was pretty impressive.  It was knotty and unseasoned, but I felt that I got a good feel of how to work between the heart and the sapwood.  My father was a woodworker in his spare time, and I have some of his old hand tools.  I will make a good bow at some point, with his old tools made of that good old steel.  I think that those old things, making anything by hand, are the grounding rods to being human.    I'd love to see pictures of the tomahawk and bow, if you've got them."

MilitaryStories,225rt9,Sgt_carbonero,3,Mon Apr 7 00:13:59 2014 UTC,"It shoots dead on and is quick. I can drill the bullseye with holes touching at 50 yards, on out to a hundred it spreads but it still shoots well. Out at 200 you can place the balls in a 15x15 target. My old eyes over open sights keep me within a hundred however. I am making  my son a .45 cal deer rifle, flintlock, southern mountain style so fairly plain. It is a learning gun for him, when he learns to take care of them I might make him a fancy rifle gun."
MilitaryStories,225rt9,Sgt_carbonero,3,Mon Apr 7 00:18:47 2014 UTC,"Quick on the flash?  I've only ever shot cap guns, pistols, but my understanding was that the flintlocks were slow, relatively speaking, to the cap guns and even more so to modern firearms.     Out at 200 you can place the balls in a 15x15 target.   That's pretty impressive, but then again, I think people make our forbearers out to be a lot dumber than they were.    I'd love to see the progress on your soon-to-be Hawkens rifle, and any info on how to get into putting one of these together.  Again, that maple is beautiful.  It just shines from the inside out."

I'd be lying if I said you and that other crusty old bastard Anathema weren't secretely egging me on with the Vietnam tales that actually ring true to me.  The fact that the stories you cats tell are radically different from the ""official"" war stories is undeniable.  I've met Needle-Dick, i gave him two dollars US, and he actually came back with three or four packs of smokes.  I worked with SGT Wolf.

In III Corps, the deep bush outside of Saigon was referred to as ""Indian Country,"" political correctness be damned. The 1st Cav Division band used to come out to firebases and play ""Garry Owen,"" the Division song. It apparently didn't bother anyone that we were a 7th Cavalry unit, which was Custer's command until he took it a ridge too far. ""Garry Owen"" was Custer's song.  I think I was the only one in our unit that knew that. Otherwise, most of the guys were wondering why they were playing that old-timey music and WTF.

Honestly, I've put this writing kick down for too long, and this is me getting back into it. I like the stuff you write, I like reading it, and a part of me wishes I wrote like you do. To me it's like singing or drawing or playing an instrument, it's personal, and if you don't do it with soul it doesn't matter. As long as somebody gets it, it's successful. Also, you (specifically me) have to actually do it to become more effective at it. Some of the pictures you paint are so vivid. Your assesment of the American Soldier had me in stitches.

That's the rightest thing you'll say this week.   We write differently. My mind goes jumping around. I put a Minoan bull dance in a rice paddy. I think snakes are chapter headings.  I'm pretty sure no one here has read the war-romance stuff that came out of the Civil War, but you can get a feeling for it if you visit the Gettysburg battlefield. Monuments to glory. Carefully posed, noble soldiers making the ultimate sacrifice. Everything scrubbed up and put into the patriotic narrative. Nobody mentions that most of those dead heroes died of sepsis. All of those young men, gallantly charging into a wall of steel for God and Country, glorious, glorious! No mention what a hot fuckin' three days that was. None.  Made me kinda queasy when I visited. I write stories set in time of war. You write war stories. I can taste the sweat, feel the weight of the pack, smell the cordite, feel the wtf frustration and confusion. It's a big, lumbering, stupid, half-blind metal thing, staggering and reeling around, haphazardly crushing unlucky soldiers under its clumsy feet. See? That's an image - the kind of thing I might write, even thought that's not what it was at all. It was what you wrote. When you wrote the solid, uncompromising truth of it all, that's what I saw.   You don't get an option on what you write, I think. First you write something, then you figure out what you're doing. I want the truth from a war writer. Ernie Pyle was a shocking guy in his time, and he had to sugar-coat it to get past the censors. I need that truth. We all need the truth. You tell it so I can hear it. That is so valuable.

White sand, friendly villagers, cool breezes from the sea. If you‚Äôre a wounded NVA guy, this would be a good place to get dropped off by your buddies, no? Local girls, good food.‚Äù He walked over to a hammock. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a hospital bed.‚Äù He picked up one of the NVA packs and dumped it on the ground. Glass vials and some medical equipment fell out. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the nurse‚Äôs station. Here‚Äôs the operating room.‚Äù He picked up another pack, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a doctor‚Äôs bag. They‚Äôve got medical units roving around.  This is the hospital!‚Äù  The S2 wasn‚Äôt buying it. Or maybe he was, but he just couldn‚Äôt disappoint all those senior officers who were avid to capture the enemy version of Johns Hopkins. Those prisoners were telling the truth. They had been at a hospital. But they were both literally and figuratively speaking a different language than the Americans.  So we kept on looking for the hospital. Which meant barging into fishing villes, forcing their patients to go underground, forcing their remaining young men to go into the bush, and the rest of the ville had to endure the company of American j√§germonsters.  We‚Äôd roll across the sand-dunes, pick a random fishing village, line up and move in ready for bear. We had some attached South Vietnamese interrogators, called ‚ÄúRuff-puffs‚Äù (Regional Provisional Forces) in case we needed to grill somebody. But we hardly ever did.  Here‚Äôs what we found. Women and kids. Old women. Young, pregnant women. Maybe one or two old guys. It was a running joke to point at one of the pregnant village women and ask the old guy, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the father?‚Äù He‚Äôd point to himself. He‚Äôs the Dad. Uh huh. Point to another girl. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the father of this one?‚Äù Well, guess what, that‚Äôs his too. After about twenty minutes we‚Äôd all be laughing, the old man included.  But still, big, scary, smelly, armed invaders all over your ville. Kinda edgy. The villagers were all fake smiles and tension.  Picture this scene then: A hot, bright day on the low conifers that top the dunes. We‚Äôve just rolled in. No resistance, but the villagers have been careless - there were medical packs dropped here and there. Someone had been here recently. The Ruff-Puffs were talking harshly to the resident old man.  I was plotting fire and getting lunch. Across the white sand stomped Sergeant Wolf. He was hauling a boy, about 10, by one arm. The boy was screaming in protest and dragging his feet. Wolf looked pissed off. He was wearing his helmet, fatigue pants with a pistol. He had no shirt - a totally white, hairy guy about twice the size of Vietnamese male. The kid‚Äôs other arm was being held by his mother (or grandmother - hard to tell) who was also being dragged along, even with both her feet planted in the sand. She was screaming too. Behind her, half running, was another old man, pleading the boy‚Äôs case in rapid Vietnamese. This procession was headed straight for the Ruff-Puff track.  I was eating C rations. Dinner and a show! I picked up my food and joined the parade.  When grandpa-san and momma-san caught sight of the Ruff-Puff track the wailing and crying and pleading doubled in volume, but Wolf was relentless. He dragged them on.  He dragged them right past the Ruff-Puff track and over to the medical track. He stopped there, turned around, broke Momma‚Äôs grip on the boy‚Äôs other arm, lifted the boy up, sat him down in the track, lifted the kid's leg in front of our medic‚Äôs nose, and pointed to an infected, infested pus blossom on the boys leg. ‚ÄúLance that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClean it up.‚Äù  Then he glared at momma-san and grandpa-san who were staring at the red-cross on the medic‚Äôs bag getting a clue. As soon as he saw they understood what was going on, he turned and stomped over to his track without another word.  One of his track crew gave him a look. ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù said Wolf. ‚ÄúI got kids. You need to take care of that shit. Can‚Äôt just let it fester.‚Äù  No one said anything. We were all kind of astonished. I don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but I was having difficulty imagining Sergeant Wolf with a kid. Wasn‚Äôt possible, was it? Damn.  But y‚Äôknow, that was the most sane thing I saw that day. Good to see. I like to think that somewhere a pack leader lifted up his muzzle and smelled the air. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre capable of producing an adult alpha,‚Äù he said to his mate. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hope for them.‚Äù  Maybe so. We should get a second opinion from the Killer Whales."

MilitaryStories,21z5la,I_am_Tre,7,Wed Apr 2 05:36:09 2014 UTC,"Thank you. It's just a story. Started with SGT Wolf's dragging of that boy. That's the core. You know how some restaurants will box up your leftovers - the regular ones will box it in styrofoam, but the nice ones will fancy it up, make a paper swan foil pouch or something?   It's still just leftovers in there. Sometimes things reflect back and forth and enhance each other. There was Wolf, acting like a mensch, being a good Dad, in spite of how he looked. There were all these pups around him imprinting on that behavior. I wanted to show that. It seemed like a good thing in the middle of all the bad misunderstandings, some of them decades old, that litter the Street Without Joy.  Yeah. Some joy - even there. It ain't much, but it's something. I like that memory. I made a paper swan."

MilitaryStories,21z5la,Staff_Guy,4,Wed Apr 2 03:18:52 2014 UTC,I can't tell you how unsurprised I am that you referenced Girl Genius. =)
MilitaryStories,21z5la,Staff_Guy,7,Wed Apr 2 09:15:04 2014 UTC,"Girl Genius is a guilty pleasure. I have to be discrete about it - it's way too young for me. My girls would be shocked - This in not for YOU! Go and read Pogo, or L'il Abner or Dagwood or something. Show some dignity in your senescence.  I has no dignity. Aw. Besides, don't you think the freakin' J√§germonsters are a perfect analogy? I mean, here are these ancient people. They are smallish, generally underfed, kind of a uniform color and features. They have a culture in which dignity is prized, ""face"" is crucial, smiling is a sign of embarrassment, and loud talking is a sign of agression and anger.  They have neighbors who are different - tribesmen in the interior, Cambodians to the west, Han to the north - who are different from them to the point that they can tell them apart from the locals. Enough difference to fight about, surely. But, by world standards, mostly the same Asian featured humans.  Then these aliens show up. Some of them look okay. I, for instance, am 5'8.5"", tall but not freakish for a Veitnamese. I'm white, with brown hair, regular features, maybe kind of a big nose, but not too big. But there are others.... wow. Freakishly tall, overfed, overmuscled. Every color under the sun. Features from elf-like to hideous, goblinlike. The strangers are loud - really loud! - they laugh like crazy people. They smile all the time, and they're not embarrassed at all - by anything! ever!    They bounce all over everywhere. They stomp on anything that gets in their way. And for all their undignified cheerfulness and overfriendliness, they are so dangerous! They have incredible weapons, and they all seem to be masters of them. They use them on a moment's notice - sometimes they don't even stop laughing before they start shooting. They're batshit crazy, they don't seem to care about anything but each other, and they don't care about each other all that much. When one of them gets hurt, they all have a big laugh about it!  Doesn't that sound exactly like J√§germonsters? I believe I am entitled to love and plug Girl Genius. I am one of de brudderhood. Ve hunt!"

We were at a range, doing an assault on a trench complex with complex obstacle.  Mine/wire type.  We'd done the dry fire, the blank fire, and were getting ready for the live fire.  This was the daylight iteration.  So us Engineer types are getting the bangalore's prepped, making sure the grappling hooks are untangled and good to go, re-checking that blank adaptors are off, etc., and smoking cigarettes while  we're still on whatever the fuck you call the admin breaks.  The Grunts are getting their shit together and doing rock drills.  This team leader is running one of his guys through fragging out a bunker.  The PFC stops, holds up his live hand grenade, and says, ""So how does this work again, Sarn't.""  We all backed off, and decided that once we were through the breach we'd wait a little longer before mixing in with the Rolling-T."

I got rid of the thumb safeties, because I figured if I needed them I'd forget, but fuck grenades.  I've done a ton of demo.

MilitaryStories,21psj7,SoThereIwas-NoShit,9,Sun Mar 30 03:12:23 2014 UTC,I love frags. When I was a boot I somehow always ended up with the frags on live-fire ranges and kill houses. After the first few I got over the nervousness. It's as close to being able to blow things up as I can get as an 0311.

MilitaryStories,21psj7,Staff_Guy,8,Sun Mar 30 04:36:21 2014 UTC,Will vote with you in that camp. Playing range safety on a grenade bunker got me close enough to last a very long time. I have no real issues with using grenades. Watching a shit ton of other people fumble with them? Fuck that.
MilitaryStories,21psj7,Dittybopper,2,Sun Mar 30 11:16:07 2014 UTC,"Why do I picture you with large round eyes and shaking a lot? Thumb safeties, never heard of those, ours were pull the pin and get rid of the damned thing. I came close to grenading myself once in VN by tossing them out of a jeep. I needed to get rid of several pretty old ones as we were traveling in for a Stand Down, a three day R&R and refit where I knew we'd receive new grenades and ammo in general. I tossed one, it exploded harmlessly in a rice paddy, second, same thing. The third though took a bounce and ended up on top of a dike... KA-CRACK - several small holes in the canvas jeep top but none in me or my partner. Having holes in your canvas top sucks during the monsoon season."

MilitaryStories,21psj7,oberon,2,Sun Mar 30 20:51:38 2014 UTC,"We had an old couch in our hangar that almost certainly carried exotic diseases.  I wanted to bring it out into the middle of a gravel patch, soak it in 100 low lead (the drone fuel we used) and light it up.  My other awesome idea that nobody let me do was to microwave a .50 round.  Keep reading!  We had these old Iraqi bunkers all over the FOB that had a staircase going down inside.  There were about three right-angle turns on the way down.  The idea was to put the microwave (with a physical timer, i.e. it can be set at max time without having power) at the bottom of this staircase, and then (with the entire extension cord in my possession) plug in the microwave, unreel the extension cord as I walk out, and then when everyone is clear of the bunker, plug it in and wait for the boom.  Include before and after pics of the microwave for my friends back home.  Could've had so much fun if it weren't for all the ""safety"" bullshit."

You will not find R.O.C in any military manual(that I am aware of).  The army actually calls it terrain board analysis( I think memory hazy) or course of action (COA)  Basically means you talk about what is supposed to happen, everyone gets to see where everyone else is going(in theory) to be.  Also you get to discuss dangers to the mission and possibly ID problems that haven't been thought of yet.   Then you start the mission and it all goes to shit in about 4 seconds.   Source: got yelled at for calling them rock drills."
MilitaryStories,21moqs,AnathemaMaranatha,24,Fri Mar 28 22:37:59 2014 UTC,"(continued from the OP)   FANTASY & SCIENCE FICTION: I came home to Colorado. What with all the travel time and time at home, I had about 9 days left. Time for desperate measures. I called my sister.  Sis was up at CU Boulder in a high-rise freshman dorm called William‚Äôs Village. She‚Äôd been busting my chops for about six months that I should meet her roommate Gwendolyn. Gwendolyn is so smart. She‚Äôs so pretty. You two would just hit it off so much, plus she‚Äôs my best friend! Didn‚Äôt want to date my sister‚Äôs best friend, but sometimes a man‚Äôs gotta do what a man‚Äôs gotta do. Set me up, Sis, I‚Äôm runnin‚Äô outta time.  I drove up to Boulder. God, it was nuts. Boulder was trying to be more-Berkeley-than-thou; it was a hippie-fashion showdown. Peace, Love, Dove, Kill-the-Pigs. I had sucked up enough of that stuff in Boston - better done, more thoughtful and less in-your-face-Mom&Dad, but essentially the same stuff. I was pretty OD‚Äôed. I got a room in the Travel Lodge downtown away from the campus, and headed for Williams Village.  My short hair got me some ‚Äúnarcnarc‚Äù snorts in the lobby, but Sis was there in beads, and flower-power clothes to attest to my bona fides. I wasn‚Äôt a cop. I was merely unenlightened. This was going so well.   We went upstairs to meet Gwendolyn. Considering my condition, it was a remarkable meeting. Gwen obviously was suffering from a cold or allergies or something. Upon meeting, we fell into a state of immediate mutual indifference. A nothing burger. How the hell was that even possible?  Well it was possible. I bid Gwen a fond good-bye, she said ‚ÄúDice to beed oo,‚Äù and I dragged my sister into the hallway. Time to stop beating around the bush, pun in-fucking-tended.  I grabbed my sister‚Äôs shoulders and braced here against the wall. ‚ÄúCathy, find me a woman.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut Gwendolyn...‚Äù she whined.  ‚ÄúNo. Not Gwendolyn. Find. Me. A. Woman.‚Äù  She looked puzzled for a minute. Then her eyes got wide with a kind of horrified comprehension. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said softly, ‚ÄúYou mean Jessie?‚Äù  Jessie? I had never heard of Jessie. I had no idea who she was. ‚ÄúYes. Jessie. Where is she? Let‚Äôs go find her.‚Äù  She was upstairs. Jessie turned out to be a girl a couple of inches shorter than me, nicely curved in the right places, sandy hair, freckles. She wasn‚Äôt giggly. She looked like a ranch-girl. If you don‚Äôt know what that means, she looked like she could push horses around, drive a jeep, take care of a sick cow, fix a fence without any help and clock your sorry ass if you got out of line. It means a lot of other things too, but you‚Äôll have to find that out for yourself if you‚Äôre ever lucky enough to run into one. It also meant that things were looking up.  Yes, she would like to go out with soldier-boy brother. It turned out that she had a good understanding of how a man could be out of time for the niceties of romance. The pill had freed up a lot of leeway for young women while I was overseas, and Jessie was willing to gamble a little. Which is my way of saying the evening went well. I‚Äôm not gonna say much more about that because she‚Äôs out there in her early sixties now, and things did not end well between us. My fault, I think. I should have been more alert to what was happening to me.   Boulder and the whole 60s thing was wearing on me. It wasn‚Äôt just the anti-war stuff. It was all the unarmed people. It was the streetlights, and sidewalks and sewer lines just right out there where somebody could blow them up. It was the cast-iron sense of safety everyone had. Everyone seemed crazy. If I‚Äôd had any idea that feeling of isolation and anomie would last another 30 years, I probably would have spared Jessie the trouble of my company. She was a nice lady. She didn‚Äôt deserve that. You don‚Äôt get PTSD at war. You get it at home.  Which doesn‚Äôt mean that Jessie wasn‚Äôt an angel of mercy to me. I was just kind of out of it. One night she wanted to go to some party, and I wasn‚Äôt up to it. I told her she could come see me at the Travel Lodge when she was tired of partying. I really wasn‚Äôt expecting her to come back that night. That was okay. I was getting ready to back to reality. Funny thing to say, no? In Vietnam we called the States ‚Äúthe real world.‚Äù Not so far as I could see.  I was actually sort of ready to be alone for a while. I could handle interior spaces like a motel room okay. There was a TV. I had a newspaper, books. I just vegged out. About 8 PM, just as the TV started to get interesting, there was a knock at the door. I opened it, Jessie blazed past me into the bathroom and shut the door. I went back to the bed and TV wondering if she was pissed. She wasn‚Äôt.  I wish I could show the image still in my mind. After about ten minutes, she emerged from the bathroom and wafted in slow motion towards the bed. I can see her now, blondish hair flying, pale skin, curved, beautiful, perfect, clad only in black panties and a white bra - a vision of just what Johnny-went-for-a-soldier needs right now, but could not dream up even in his most fervid fantasies. She was as real as battle. She was as unreal as battle. Forget Dejah Thoris, Lieutenant Uhura, Dr. Susan Calvin - this was the fantasy girl. Perfect. Real. Now.   She rolled onto the bed, put her head on my shoulder and draped one leg across my waist.  And I said... God, I want to go back in time and beat myself to death right then and there, before I could open my mouth.  No, it must be said, no matter how shameful. No matter what a traitor to my gender I reveal. No matter what idiot blasphemy I uttered against Aphrodite and all the gods and goddesses who govern what is sacred, mysterious and primal between men and women...   I said, to this gift-of-the-goddess... I said, ‚ÄúBut Star Trek is on.‚Äù  I hate myself.  EPILOGUE: It‚Äôs a wonder an Athenian Dishonor Guard of truncated Hermes didn‚Äôt march right into the motel room, break my dick in two, turn my scrotum inside out and frogmarch me through the Traitors‚Äô Gate of the XY Kingdom.  But the goddess was with Jessie. She laughed and said, ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Ranch girl. No drama.   No, not really. TV off. Lights out. My premature nerd-gasm was brushed aside, and for a brief moment, we were an island of true reality in a sea of insanity. It was lovely, life-saving in a way. Couldn‚Äôt last. Just as well.  I hope Jessie is well. She is well remembered. I hope that helps."

No, nothing happened...   A nerd LT, this I shoulda seen. Of course I was back a year by the time you took this trip, and, I was in Boston. Ever go to the Tea Party? Some friends and I used to occasionally put on light shows there. I had to make that dreadful choice too, extend for six months and get out or return the the states and do six months as an instructor at the Dittybop advances course. I chose to get the hell out of dodge while the getting was good. I was stationed at Ft. Devens about 30 miles west of Beantown. I too never wore the uniform off base if at all possible, too easy to end up in a fight. My birth away from the barracks was the USS Constitution, Old Ironsides. I had met the enlisted Duty Crew while on a tear through the Combat Zone one drunken evening, they invited me back to the ship. It became my base when in Boston, oh the wemen that ship pulled in... glorious!   Thank you for another wonderful story /u/AM! Brought back some memories it did."

You started this. You reminded me of Country Joe & the Fish. Jessie is the girl who took me to that concert  Actually my older brother was, and still is, a total geek/nerd. I just got it by osmosis, plus he never shuts up. He's my favorite brother. Strangely enough he majored in business, and got a job at a tech place where he was the unofficial ""Speaker to Geeks"", the translator between management suits and the people doing the actual work.  I learned to swim at Fort Devens and - get this - Walden Pond. It's funny how little bits and pieces of history seep into your life, no?  Because are you fucking kidding me? You drank and whored on the Constitution!!! That's terrible! That's an outrage! That demeans everything I've ever read about the noble and courageous history of that grand ship, and the entire United States Navy to boot!   Wow. I'm green with envy. You bad.

MilitaryStories,21moqs,debtofredundancydebt,5,Sat Mar 29 13:42:09 2014 UTC,"You are of course correct, if it had of been known a huge flap would have rocked Beantown over the fun being had aboard that historic vessel. The fun would have came to an abrupt end and Beacon Hill gone back to sleep. We kept it on the down-low, had enough sense for that anyway. That Honor or Duty crew on Old Ironsides had it made in the shade. Their officers only came around when the ship was putting on the dog for a ceremony or something, otherwise they had free run of it. Tours generally only got to see the main and gun deck, the deck below the gun deck and aft were the crew's living quarters. Their quarters were equipped with a modern, if small galley and bunks plus a candy and Coke machine, I forget if there were washing facilities but there must have been. They had rigged one cabin with black lights and nothing but mattresses on the deck... Below decks were cramped, designed for men of a generally smaller stature; you bumped your head a lot until you got used to it. Needless to say that beautiful old ship remains one of my favorites and has lead to a lifetimes fascination with sailing ships of the line. I would sometimes lounge on the main deck reading Melville's White Jacket relating his time serving on the USS United States, a sister ship to the USS Constitution. Reading his descriptions of life aboard a Man O' War I would rome the lower decks checking out the areas he detailed. At least I obtained a bit of education while associated with her. I was living in Boston when she was brought out for the Tall Ships during the Centennial and, when building my studio, worked in the Financial District downtown and across the river from her so used to observe her activities daily; always with fond affection. White Jacket lead to Moby Dick, still my most favorite American novel. I would visit the Bedford Whaling Museum with his book and again read and check out the 1/3 scale whaling ship Lagoda to aid me in learning and picturing the whaling trade of the 1840s. I suppose all of that has lead me to my current passion - making flintlock rifles circa 1750 and later. I finished a 1760 style Pennsylvania longrifle last fall patterned after a rifle created by a Mr. Jacob Dickert, a fine gunsmith working in Lancaster county PA.   enough for now, got to get the shop - working on a Tennessee mountain rifle today..."

You have to realize that in Al Dora, Baghdad, we had a two truck, six PAX, two SAW minimum to roll out.  We didn't do the mountain of paperwork to get out the front gate that it took later on.  Never saw or heard of a single risk assessment.  Not one.  As Engineers, and as an individual platoon attached to an Infantry Battalion, we had a lot of leeway.  This led to stuff like us going to the local market for soda, ice, fruit, hamburgers, cooked chickens, potato chips, whatever.  We'd just tell White-Seven-One how many PAX, give a grid for our pretend UXO, and go to town.  Consequently, we spent a lot of time talking to the locals.  We were also based in the Dora.  We did mounted and dismounted patrols in the same neighborhoods.  We knew which 'hoods were sketchy, and which ones we could go in and sit down and have tea and watch recorded Seinfeld episodes on VHS (the Christian ones).  We had hotlines, and solid informants.  If something happened, we were there in minutes.  They knew us, and we knew them.  The last month or two, everybody started getting consolidated at Falcon,  which was a horrible idea.  Our AO was the same, but now we were five or six miles away.  There weren't any US troops in Dora anymore.  The informants couldn't just come to the front gate.  The people who lived in the neighborhood couldn't come to the front gate.  A guy on guard duty couldn't call down to his SOG saying that it looked like something was going on in that neighborhood over there.  It didn't make any sense.  The people who actually wanted us there were terrified that we were leaving, because they knew what was going to happen.  I don't think the Battalion Commander wanted it to happen.  About the time we were leaving, Big Army was starting to get involved.  At our Bn HQ, where us Engineers lived, the BC had put out that it was strictly a non-salute area, and within a unit's AO, their was no uniform standard.  You didn't even have to carry your weapon as long as it was under guard.    I guess what I'm trying to say is that we were so close with the average Haj, that it was hard not to see what was going to happen.  We started out being a part of their liberation, and we cared.  We were their neighbors, for a while.  Once they moved us out to stupid fucking Falcon, that connection was broken.  The guy's we did right-foot left-foot with had only heard about Iraq on the news, and they saw shadows around every corner.    Fuck, I'm trying to explain this whole thing, and it's bigger than me.  Let me start over.  I think, no, I know, that what started was a terrible feedback loop.  -They were, most of them, happy to see us.  We felt like we were actually doing something good.  -Our mission became policing.  In June or July we had our first KIA(the Battalion, not our platoon).  We started getting more aggressive, whether necessarily or unnecessarily I don't know.  Probably the latter.  -IED's became a new thing.  Poorly made, but we had no armored vehicles.  The mood turned a little more.  It just kept going that way.  More attacks started happening, more guys killed, our searches got less friendly, etc.  I'm just starting to confuse myself now.  Maybe some of this makes sense."

My take was a little different phrasing, same end result. ""You want leaders? Every leader in the last 30 years who wasn't a Baathist got killed. Every Baathist isn't allowed to be in charge of anything. What's left are people who will agree that anything you say is right because they don't want to get killed, and people who think they're smart enough to lie to your face and get away with it.""  My guess? Most of the three letter agencies got someone to lie to them a lot, especially VIP types. They knew what the 2003-2008 civilian leadership wanted, so they delivered the reports that were expected without digging too deep. After all, they got 'evidence' straight from the informant's mouth, so if it turned out to be wrong it was officially Not Their Fault."

I enjoy knowing somebody's far more composed thoughts on what many of us have seen or done   I've stewed in these juices for over four decades now. It's interesting to see what gets people excited.  I got all excited to read /u/SoThereIwas-NoShit 's As Samawah story of what must have been a brigade-on-line battle. That was the kind of fighting we trained for back in the 60s. Instead, barring firebase attacks, the largest fight I was in was maybe a company or two on line. In the jungle. I was always curious about what that kind of fighting was like. The jungle was strictly OJT.  The immediacy of those Samawah stories resonated with me. When I was a kid, we played war games too - nothing digital - cardboard hex-gridded maps and cardboard game pieces. You'd crash some cavalry brigade into a weakened infantry division and roll the dice. Even then I wondered what the hell was going on there - was it just a well-oiled machinery of men, guns and horses in perfect formation?   The games didn't match what I was reading about Waterloo and Guadalcanal. I've never been in such a fight. But the Samawah stories rang true for me. I could see how playing pieces move on a map, and the IRL way it gets done. Units stumble and stagger towards each other. The best trained unit is only less clumsy. That's what I read there. I would think that would resonate with young soldiers more than an old man's memories - something confused and confusing, disorganized, frightening, alarming, where your training seems only marginally relevant.  It's not like it's new. It needs to be retold with the immediacy of memory in the jargon of the time. But it's the same down through history.  And we are here as on a darkling plain, swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.  ‚ÄúDover Beach,‚Äù Matthew Arnold (1822-88)"

Y'know scholars identify four different polytheistic views of the world concerning how humans relate to the gods.  One: The gods are indifferent to us. We are dust under their feet as they pursue their own, mysterious ends. At best, humans are their tools. At worst too.  Two: We are the gods' beloved, but disobedient children. If we get another detention, their wrath will be terrible. All of the monotheistic religions seem to have adopted this approach.  Three: We are the gods' food. This is the scariest one. The Maya took this one to some incredible lengths.   Four: We are the plaything of the gods. If I had to adopt any religious view based on my experiences, it'd be this one.  Case in point: If the gods give us access to Truth, they make it like an Easter egg hunt from hell. Hey, watch this! I'm gonna give that idiot a diamond-hard insight, but I'm gonna put it under this pile of shit. He'll have it, but here's the funny part.

About a week after I got back, a young lady took me to a concert at Boulder's Folsom Field Stadium, sure enough, CJ&tF. The warm-up band started in at 8 pm. They played every song they had for four hours - CJ&tF were mysteriously delayed. I declined the passing doobies - I wasn't into that yet - but I think I got a contact-high from the mood of the crowd and the truly excellent music. It was so excellent, in fact, that when CJ finally showed up at midnight, he was roundly booed, even when he led off with his biggest (and only) hit song.  The warm-up band?

What happened in OP's story happened to me a couple of weeks ago - different nationalities - but essentially the same story. Oh yeah, and it was legal weed, not boilermakers. And there was child there, not naked, but certainly benignly neglected by his Dad.  And then grandma-san showed up with mamma-san in tow, and all hell broke loose. I don't even want to think about what Dad went through, but grandma-san latched on to my earlobe and didn't let go for a couple of hours. Was a bad trip. I'm totally off gluten-free brownies.  So I guess the OP could be a story of the War Between the Sexes, how it's the same world over. Which it is. Which was what OP said.   Never mind then. I'm gonna find some more of those brownies.

I could tell about how that room we all bunked in took an RPG round. It was singled out, one round in the middle of the night. No one hurt. Or I could continue with the Fishnet Factory and detail how the barber was busted as a VC with maps of the compound in his pocket. Or, tell of the VC radio op sitting off about 400 yards and spying on us, making two radio transmissions per day to report his findings. Then there is the one of the platoon sgt going bonkers and trying to kill some kids begging C-rats. There is more, a lot of shit happened in that place - like the guys in the bunker at the corner of the compound nearest us raping some Vietnamese whores and getting a midnight claymore (their own) in their face for their trouble.

They would get an azimuth that their was a shortwave radio detected in the jungle and then take off trying to find it.  The cook attached/assigned to their company prior to being drafted had been a chef in a big city hotel.  The cook told them if they found anything good in the jungle to bring it back and he would cook it for them.  Well one day they found an iguana out in the jungle and brought it back.  The cook cut it into filets and served it up.  Well there was some officer from another unit who had heard about the excellent food and was there eating.  The officer gets a plate and sits down.  Talking to one of his officer buddies he chowed down.  He eventually picked out a bone, a rib bone, attached to a piece of spine and then to another rib bone.

MilitaryStories,20cpin,troxy,3,Fri Mar 14 03:04:58 2014 UTC,"Food is food. Dressing it up is cuisine. Sometimes it pays to pat√© the main course, in the interest of digestion. But y'know, all those mystery meats in the estuary stew were only almost deal killers. I was barely twenty, really hungry in the way only a twenty-something can be, and what the hell - look out stomach, here it comes. Was fun.  Cuisine is entertainment too. I've had rattlesnake, spiced up in a kind of salad presentation. I've had rattlesnake neatly diced in the skin and bones of the snake too. It's a different meal.   It's funny how your taste buds are not the only arbiters of what you'll eat. Apparently the eyes have a veto. Likewise your palate (the roof of your mouth) has issues with anything that's suspiciously crunchy or chewy or prickly. Sometimes the vote is nope. Sometimes the alarms set off by your vision and palate just add to the experience. That's cuisine too, I guess.  Cuisine is a conversation too.   ""You fed me snake""!!

This Ajumma would feed countless drunk GIs amazing Korean food at any hour of the night.  Not my finest hour, but we came off the bus from Itaewon around 0200 and were fiending for some food.  Well, Moms was dark, but word was she never minded cooking for us.  Following my elders, we knocked on her door and she woke up and let us in, cussing a storm the whole time.  I'm still not sure who's better at a dressing down, the CSM or Mom.  Maybe different flavors of the same stew.  Mom puts us all to work.  If she's going to cook for us, we're going to help.  I'm sent back for a bag of peppers, my buds are sorting veggies etc.  We get our bowls of cheesy egg ramen and dig in.  Mom decides to do some prep work while we eat and is chopping up these long thinnish green peppers.  I like em hot, so I reach over and grab one.  She smacks the shit out of my hand.  ""No, you dumb drunk GI!  Very hot, no!""  Soju, 3 kettles worth, says, ""Bullshit, you like it hot, go for it!"".    I reach again and I'm quicker this time.  Soju had helped my reflexes.

MilitaryStories,20cpin,skillet42565,4,Fri Mar 14 15:59:24 2014 UTC,"Reminds me of when I worked as a busboy in a Mexican restaurant. It was late, and we were trying to close up for the night, but there was this one customer who didn't want to leave. His waiter had already left, and I was waiting on my ride, so I agreed to take his table. He asks for a glass of water with a wedge of lime. He makes it very well known that he wants lime, not lemon, but lime. He than proceeded to ask me if I knew the difference between the two, and which was green and which was yellow.  So as I go to get this SOB some water, I'm fuming because I just want to be done already. I go into the back, and the Mexican cook, having witnessed the whole thing is rolling on the floor laughing while I'm getting a glass and slamming things around. He offers to cook me up something while I wait (I suppose to make me feel better) and without thinking I say yes.  I go to give the fat piece of shit his water, with a half of a lemon in it (seriously don't fuck with the people who make your food), and storm off before he can say anything.   I go back to the kitchen, and Freddie is smiling wide as he hands me the two shittiest looking tacos ever (like taco bell quality ((we were rated highly on the Zagat scale, which made this even more depressing)). I take them and thank him as I sit down and begin to eat.  About halfway into the taco, my mouth starts to burn. Not hurt, but burn. I'm tearing up and snot is starting to run down my face. That's when Freddie says ""Hey DrZums!"" As I made eye contact with that evil man, he poured the last of the milk down the drain while laughing. In my poor spanish (which was all I could speak with him), I manage to get out of my mouth ""que?"" as I frantically point back and forth to to the taco and my mouth.   He (on the floor at this point), just says ""concentrated ghost pepper extract"" and tosses me this tiny bottle, which doesn't matter at this point because I'm full out sobbing and can't read anything.  Later (like 3 hours), I read the back of the label. It clearly says, to be used only by the drop, dilute into 64oz of salsa. Later that week he told me he had decided 4 drops right into the middle would be entertaining. It wasn't."
MilitaryStories,20cpin,skillet42565,5,Fri Mar 14 05:19:52 2014 UTC,"When I was a kid, they told us that spicy foods were a racial thing - folks in hot climes just evolved to eat the clearly poisonous things that lived there. Yeah, no.  When that explanation was no longer polite, they told us spicy food was a practical thing. Real food - raw meat - would spoil faster in hot climates, and spices could delay spoilage somewhat, and cover up the taste of spoiled meat. Nope. The Koreans have some dishes that will slag iron ore, and they live in a cold part of the world.  I'm not sure what the answer is, but I am sure that people are pretty much willing to make something up on the fly to explain it. What I've seen is that people from all climes and races differ. Some can handle spice. Some can't.  Those who can't are a source of infinite entertainment to those who can. This guy can't eat food! What a tool! I suppose Lutherans laugh quietly and soberly at visitors who can't handle their lutefisk.   Later that week he told me he had decided 4 drops right into the middle would be entertaining. It wasn't.   Are you not entertained? It's all show biz. I think you were seated too close the action. That always ruins the show for me too. Complain to the usher.  Funny is funny. The churches think people lose their virtue and drift into sin due to lust, avarice, envy... and four other things. They forgot to include humor. If something is funny, all decency is abandoned at the door, even by bishops and deacons. You learned the hard way. I don't think there's an easy way.  Also beware of laughing Marines."

The hot water will help rinse out the oils, which is what's causing you misery.  Burns like hell when you're rinsing, though."

You can never tell who is friend or who the foe is. At least when we were fighting the Germans, they all wore uniforms and we always knew where they were at all times; in front of us.‚Äù We continued our conversation and he wanted to take a picture with me.   I like this guy. He wasn't shitting you about the front-lines stuff. That was the big comment all the NCO's and officers who had been in WWII and Korea kept making about Vietnam. No front lines. It was a 360 degree war. They found it horrible, baffling. We just thought it was normal.  Well, it's normal now, isn't it? Funny how the idea of a front-line and a rear area just vanished. It was so important in WWII - y'know, get an owie in the Hurtgen Forest, go to the rear to get it treated, catch a jeep to Paris for a couple of days... Christ, can you even imagine that?  I couldn't. I had to go back to Bien Hoa Airport - about as secure an area as we had - to get some paperwork done. I ended up stranded at the airport - no ride to my firebase until morning. The AF guy behind the desk said I could stay at the BOQ in Saigon, I just had to check all my ordinance in with him and hop on the bus.  I can't imagine what look I gave him. I think I scared him. Give up my weapons? That was the craziest thing I ever heard! He might as well have told me I could grow wings and fly.   I dossed on a bench, with all my gear around me. Overhead cover inside a secure perimeter. I had water and C-rats. What could the BOQ offer me that was better than that? Give up my weapons, my ass.  The new normal, huh? The old normal sounds nice though. Imagine. Paris, man...  Good story. Made me all nostalgic."

I was hoping to see what your response would be; just to see what your thoughts were on this subject.    Well, it's normal now, isn't it?   It is strange to think of a static front line where all outgoing ammo goes in one singular direction. Those days are gone now and there you're not even completely safe on your own FOB/COP.   I had a similar story where I went up to Balad to go visit a particular group of people and they asked me to turn in my weapon. No big deal as it was a large FOB. When I turned it in, they had me fill out the information on the weapon so I could return the paperwork to receive my weapon once I was ready to leave. The AF Staff Sergeant (E5) started rattling off my weapon serial number ""7133..."" and I interrupted him by finishing the serial number sequence ""...154."" He then proceeded to yell and said ""Never, ever, memorize your weapon's serial number!"" What?! This defies the most basic ground rule of being in the Army. We were taught to memorize our weapon's serial number ever since we started in Basic Training. I just gave him a roger and us Army guys had a good laugh about it afterwards..... To this day, I still remember the number ""7133154.""  I cannot imagine what it would be like to hitch a ride back to Paris in a Jeep....all the pretty french girls and a good supply of wine....both of which lacking in Iraq. That's right, no alcohol down range."

Dad made just the tail end of WWII, infantry. He's in the other room sleeping just now, which is his job these days. He spent 28 years in the army, came out a Command Sergeant Major. Did two tours in Vietnam.  He and I sometimes trade stories.  I'm with /u/AM, no way in hell I'd give up my weapon while in a combat zone and as he stated it was a 360 degree war. You never knew where or when it might erupt all over you and Saigon was dangerous all the time. I hated it when I had to drive through Saigon, always looking for some fool to step out and shoot you or lob a grenade in the Jeep. I liked to be out in the field where you could control who approached you. /u/AM mentioned not liking choppers or tanks either and I am with him on that - I wanted both feet on the ground, disliked traveling boxed up in APC's intently, and to heck with tanks or helicopters of any stripe. A man likes to feel he has the option to hit the dirt instantly.   I too enjoyed the read /u/Knights-of-Ni. Thank you sir.

At the time, I was just an E-4 and without divulging too much information, it was compound within a compound so giving up this weapon wasn't a choice of mine. I don't mind helicopters, I'm rather fond of the shithooks since they were my first helo ride in country. I'll never forget the sight of looking out the back of a Chinook as we flew over Baghdad late at night. Eerily beautiful.

I was in some airport or another, and there were a bunch of Marines coming home from Iraq hanging out in the bar.  I bought them a round, and they thought it was the best thing ever.  I was practically made an honorary Marine on the spot.  Another time, I was in a Starbucks.  There was a soldier in line in front of me.  I motioned the barista over and quietly told her to put the guy's coffee on my tab with the full intention of remaining anonymous.  She announced my intentions to the entire store.

Personally, it was always awkward for me whenever someone would buy me a drink or give me a free meal. I hate getting gifts (Just ask my fiance' I have Christmas cards that I have yet to open!) and I feel bad when people buy me stuff if I'm in uniform because I didn't join for free stuff.

I was scared every time I got off the ground, but helicopters were the worst. I am constitutionally unable to comprehend how or why a helicopter ever leaves the ground. It is like an abomination of nature. Makes my eyes burn just to watch.  As for flying... I am a natural born leg and an Antaeus soldier. I need to touch ground with my feet. Don't want to jump out of an airplane. Don't want to ride in nasty noisy tank. Only good thing to do in a helicopter is to hop off onto the blessed earth.  Scared me, OP. Nice writing."

I don't know how many red-clay lands Vietnam had, but I was in one too. More mini-stories.   man set foot on the moon   Noise discipline was pretty strict in the field, but there were certain times the grunts were allowed to listen to AFVN Radio on those tinny, tiny, plastic portable radios. We must've been logging when we first heard the news. We were in flat, jungle area that had been hit by B52 strikes over and over again. The jungle was all knocked around and full of old and new craters filled with water.  I was talking to SFC Murphy, oldest boy platoon leader still in the field (That's him, on the right) when a guy walks by holding a portable radio up to his ear. ""Hey!"" he says, ""We're on the moon!""  Murphy looks around at all the craters. ""No shit."" he said. Cracked everyone up. That became a buzzword for a couple of days. Point would take a knee, check something out, turn back to drag and whisper. ""We're on the moon."" Drag would whisper back, ""No shit.""    Purple Heart nomination number one.   I can't believe they were so stingy with Purple Hearts. Wasn't like that everywhere. Your Dad can have the PH I had to beat to death the year before. Sounds like he, at least, earned it. Not me. They were slinging PHs around in I Corps like it ain't no thang. It is a thang. Your Dad should have at least two.   Cooking with C4   Okay C4 cooking is like owning gremlins. There are certain rules.   Rule 1: A little dab'll do ya. Too much will flare up around your canteen cup. If you're lucky, you'll just end up having to clean all that toxic black goo off the outside of your canteen cup. If you're unlucky, it'll blow your canteen cup over, you'll lose your last bag of C-ration cocoa, and your C4 will get wet.  Rule 2: Don't get your lit C4 wet. Trust me on this. It's bad. If you violate this rule, don't breathe.  Rule 3: Don't eat the C4. Thank you for your story. I didn't think this was a rule, but since that time I've had kids, and you have to watch 'em around clay and clay-like materials. Good to know.  Rule 4: Don't light it after midnight. Or even after sunset. Beside the fact that you will be visible all the way to Hanoi, you will get eaten alive by increasingly higher-ranked echelons of NCOs and Officers who will instruct you to put that damned thing out. Sit on it if you have to. We'll medivac you in the  morning, if you live through the night.  Ah. Good times. Thanks for the story OP. Greetings to your Dad."

All of dad's old maps are stained with it.  His old uniforms are encrusted with it.  I live in Georgia, but our red clay has nothing one the Vietnamese stuff.  As far as the Purple Hearts, since he records were mostly lost, the military automatically denied that he'd been injured.  Seems par for the course for the VA since time immemorial.  I had a buddy break his leg in boot camp a couple years ago.  He had to fight the VA tooth and nail for any sort of treatment.  Sure they took basic care of him before they kicked him out of the military.  Any ongoing treatment was pulling teeth, though.  Thanks, as always, for the reply.  It's amazing that more than half a million folks went to Vietnam and they all came back with such different experiences."

It's the oldest story there is in American military stories - how the military threw me in with a bunch of random guys from just about everywhere, and now they're my guys. And all the people who I thought were my people - the ones who looked and talked like me - they are no longer my people if they aren't good with my guys. Don't be bringing up that old shit about how one of my guys is one of them - those shiftless, sneaky, dirty, snooty other people we don't like. I don't want to hear that shit, and I don't care if you're related to me.  Honestly, OP, your story reads like Heinlein and a thousand other published military stories I've read. I mean publishable.

It's bad enough that nothing seems real enough, that ""important"" things like financial planning and home loans bore the piss outta me, that everything that doesn't involve shooting feels like downtime, wasted time, some kind of eternal R&R - like I'm just killing time waiting to go back where it's real.

I was 2 1/2 years free, and joined the Guard.  I re-classed to Horizontal Construction.  A deployment came up, our Combat Engineer sister Company.  I volunteered.  I didn't tell my girlfriend, I didn't tell my family.  Two months before we left I told everybody. No one was happy, but I was.  I wasn't worried about my family, but I was worried about the lady who I thought I was going to make my wife.  I was gone fourteen months, didn't know if I was going to come back on my feet, and almost didn't.  When I did get back, I managed to destroy the best relationship I've ever had.  We're still friends, but the shit I put her through...And yeah, I still want to go back.    The best thing I ever heard was from a counselor at my local VetCenter.  It was one of the first times I saw him, and I was pouring my guts out.  He said, ""These are things I hear a lot.""  It made me feel like I wasn't crazy.  It made me feel like I was at least normal in our group."

And because I can live off that feeling until I jump again."" Jumping gave me ""that"" feeling again, you know the one. It was addictive, maybe I picked up the habit in southeast asia, but I didn't really know that. Until skydiving and I found one another civilian life was so damned boring.

MilitaryStories,1zz081,brokenarrow,10,Sun Mar 9 16:08:01 2014 UTC,"Hi OP,  The Untouchables were a G-Man outfit led by Eliot Ness, and a long-running TV show, and a movie with Sean Connery and Kevin Costner. They were ""untouchable"" in the sense that they were Feds, and could not be called off the case by some corrupt local authority on the Mob's paylist.  Untouchables in India were the lowest caste, not lepers. There is some Hindu thinking that they were the highest caste, in a way, because they had discarded all pride and pretension that affected higher castes, and thus were more likely to be re-incarnated into the next spiritual level  Lepers in Europe were required to shout ""Unclean!"" as they traveled to warn others. I don't know what their reincarnation prospects were.  Since you were in Haiti, which is notoriously corrupt, and you were troops of the American Federal Government, the name fits. Likewise, since you were helping the poorest of the poor, your reincarnation chances put you up there with the Indian Untouchables.  And since you are also in the business of delivering mail, I like ""Combat Postal."" Psycho mailmen with guns. Scary.  In the days before email and skype, mail was huge.

Too anyone that reads this and anyone that comes through that is thinking about telling us a story: DO IT. Like /u/AnathemaMaranatha mentioned, we're not here to criticize you about anything. We're here to read and make connections with our own stories, thoughts, and opinions. Short, long, happy, sad, or even painful. Just know that if you post something, you might be encouraging others to post when they read your story and remember something or feel a connection."

It was NOT your fathers fault that Joe died, never was, never could be. Yeah, war is nasty shit and awful things happen but your father should not be beating himself up over a circumstance he had no control over 40-50 years ago. The past is over, he can't do a thing about what happened that day and as you know it could very well have been him laying in that stream bed that god awful day.   I am glad he has the support of his former mates, that is priceless. Please tell him that one other vet of that war says he is blameless and to try and understand finally that he should honor Joe but not allow Joe's death to hold him back from enjoying each and every day here on earth. Somehow I feel Joe would want that too. Be well young man, thanks for your story."

The first time I ever saw him cry is when he got drunk at a reunion and finally told me the whole story about Joe.  The only other time I've seen him cry is when his mother died.  Some scars just don't go away.  He wrote a novel a could years ago which helped, I think.  I doubt he'll ever really let go of it, though."
MilitaryStories,1zrtbl,AnathemaMaranatha,7,Mon Mar 10 03:16:26 2014 UTC,"Well shit. I lost someone like that - not a friend so much as a mentor. He died because I couldn't be there. Wasn't my fault. Doesn't matter. He was my responsibility, and he died. He was ten times the soldier I could ever hope to be. He died. He wouldn't have died if I had been there. That's the truth of the matter. No excuses.  I'm not story-bombing, OP. I'm making sure you know that your Dad knows it's not his fault. He does. But that's not all there is to it. He lost a man. He'll carry that to the end of his days. Sometimes you just have to ruck up the weight of it and carry on. It is what it is.  It's your weight too, OP. He's your father. He's given you some of that weight - pretty sure he would have not done that to you by choice, but children see right through their parents. It's a hard gift. You're lucky to get it. Gives you gravity. Carry it with pride.  Greetings your Dad. Tell him I said to lighten up on the kid, ferchristsakes. It's not his fault either."
MilitaryStories,1zrtbl,AnathemaMaranatha,3,Fri Mar 7 18:54:51 2014 UTC,"You get it.  I don't think dad thought that Joe was ten times the soldier he was, but dad may have though Joe was ten times the person he was.  I believe that dad will take this guilt to his grave.  He's taken steps to lessen the load, but from my layman's viewpoint, I don't see how something like this ever goes away.  My teens were pretty rough.  I don't know how much of that was his dad coming out in him and how much of it was measuring me against guys like Joe and finding me lacking.  Especially since I've provided him with a granddaughter (never thought anything could bring out that soft side of him), we've gotten to the point where we're polite to each other.  He's very supportive of my relatively new family and has stepped up in ways I couldn't imagine in my younger days."
MilitaryStories,1zrtbl,evannever,3,Mon Mar 10 03:29:49 2014 UTC,"I met my grandfather once or twice. He was a horrible old man - patriarch of a vast family of 22 children, including 5 illegitimate ones. My father was the youngest and last legitimate child. By the time he was born, there were already two step-brothers in the mix. My father was raised by his older sisters. He adored his father from afar, a man who didn‚Äôt want to even converse with his children until they were old enough to drink.  I met my grandfather when he was in his eighties, and I was about 7. He was surrounded by his brood, and was tended to by his mistress, who became his wife as soon as my father‚Äôs mother had the courtesy to die. He was a short man, with an Otto von Bismarck moustache. My Dad arranged for his father to take me and my brother in a tour around the family farm.  It was illuminating. The man was a bully. My older brother was bookish and wore glasses. My grandfather couldn‚Äôt get over that. He bullied my brother all through the tour. The irony is that my brother is the one of us who looks most like his grandfather, only taller. I love saying that.  I took after my mothers side of the family, the Irish side. I was, my grandfather reported to my father, ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù of my grandfather. To be sure, all his children treated him like he was the king of Scotland. He though so too. He was a preening, snarky, sneering, mean, narcissistic old twat who enjoyed elevating himself by knocking others down, including a 9 year old grandson he had never met before. I was glad I met him. Explained a lot.  My father was probably the most successful child in his family - retired after 34 years in the AF as a full colonel. He was a quiet, intelligent man, self-educated - gentle and loving in a distant sort of way. We kept trying to puzzle out the distance he kept between himself and his children. He had some smart kids, but he made an effort not to ‚Äúover-praise‚Äù us so we wouldn‚Äôt get ‚Äúspoiled.‚Äù Doctor Spock was an idiot.  But when my Dad disapproved, there would be silence. It wasn‚Äôt a meditative silence. It was a thundering silence - we all could hear something going on in his head. When I finally met my grandfather, I figured out what it was. My Dad was hearing his father‚Äôs mean, sneering commentary in his head. My Dad was too nice a man to inflict that on his children, but he couldn‚Äôt stop us from hearing it anyway. Parents are transparent to their kids. That‚Äôs just the way it is.   So that was it. My father had let my grandfather‚Äôs voice escape from his head only once or twice in my life. I remember each time. More importantly, I also remember that my father silenced the voice of his father, and protected me, my brothers and my sisters from the vitriol of that creepy bloated old tyrant - a man he loved and adored. He protected his children as best he could. To do that, he had to defy his own father. Hard to do.   I have my father‚Äôs voice in my head. It is a polite, courteous, yet firm voice. It guides me. I have my father‚Äôs thunderous silences too. They make me cringe. But it is only silence. Now I recognize Dad‚Äôs silence as an act of defiance and disobedience to corrupt authority worthy of a statue in the town square. Courageous. Brave. Good for Dad. Well done. Good for me, too.   Long story, OP. Sorry. This is my roundabout way of suggesting that your Dad wasn‚Äôt measuring you and finding you lacking. My guess is that he was trying to protect you. And maybe he was listening too hard to memories of bullshit from his own father. There are no classes in fatherhood. You seek out instruction from your own parents. Sometimes that instruction is both wrong and really lousy.   I‚Äôm guessing he also thinks that maintaining a distance from you will also protect you from the war trauma he feels. He‚Äôs wrong, but he means well. I bet he thinks you‚Äôre a smart, disobedient, disrespectful, strong-willed son. I bet he‚Äôs happy and proud about that.  Sic that little girl on him. Girls are great. I had two, and they raised me up just right. Girls will tell you exactly what they need. All you have to do is learn to distinguish that from what they want. It‚Äôs doable. Moms of girls have it rougher, but that‚Äôs another story.  Anyway, there‚Äôs no way in hell your Dad can resist that girl. Girls are like war. Immediate, demanding, here-and-now - without all the shooting and trauma. The men in their lives are not role models or something to live up to. Men are big puzzles to them. Fun. Poke at ‚Äòem. Listen to them grunt and complain. Poke again. It‚Äôs great."

I want to binge read the whole thing.  This is so cool.   I'm really not doing much revision. Normally I write it all down, and then revise like a motherfucker. I usually spend hours upon hours revising and editing, but seeing as I haven't been writing for quite a long time, and I've spent the last ten years trying to write this story without much success, this is what you get.    What we get is writing that captures the yelling, snafu, fubar and more yelling that makes up grand fire & maneuver plans. If you don't write it down just the way you did, then leave it sit for a while, you'll find yourself ironing out immediacy and compelling writing just to pick off a split infinitive here and there. Not worth it.  I'm not an English teacher. I am a guy who is excited to read what you're writing. This is excellent. I want to read more, now. I want to know how it's going to come out.

It's kind of started becoming a minor obsession, but for each part I've felt that where I was stopping was where I should stop.  It's defineitly one of those things that I think about often, but not in depth.  This is forcing me to dig deeper, and it causes some interesting reactions.  I've felt my pulse spike a few times, and felt all over again the shame of my failures.  It's a weird thing, this.  I only hope that I can convey it in a meaningful way to others.  I know that this little episode I'm reconstructing from my own personal point of view is the pornography of War Stories, in a way.  The boredom, the waiting, the silliness and occasional sheer stupidity, are the bulk of the reality.  I feel that this story, though, contains enough of the mayhem and general lack of what the hell is actually going on, to maybe convey the reality to a civilian.  Hopefully.    Anyhoo...Rambling.

I dunno about gettin' through to the civilians. But maybe. I told my older daughter about checking into a hotel in Sydney about 10 hours out of the bush, and standing there for a long time in the bathroom turning the water off and on and off and on...   Well, she grows up and volunteers for the Peace Corps. Don't let anybody tell you that's an easy gig. 72 hours after she was inducted, she was in a mud hut, no running water, no electricity in a village 18 miles out of Sikasso, Mali. A couple of months later, she hauled back to civilization and calls me from a hotel room in Bamako. She's in the bathroom, turning the water on and off. She says, ""You forgot something in the story you told us. I'm watching the water go away down the sink.""  Oh yeah. When you're outside, and you use water, it doesn't go down a drain. It makes a puddle right in the middle of your stuff. You have to move all your stuff away from the puddle. I had forgotten to tell her what a pain in the ass that was, especially if a lot of people were using water all around you. My bad.  Bud, y'know, she reminded me! Wasn't expecting that! Daughters are great.  Stories are funny. They leave you and go off and make new friends and get careers and turn up back at your house with a funny twist and a pretty girl in tow.

MilitaryStories,1zli1b,Gravehog,3,Thu Jun 5 13:11:18 2014 UTC,"Seeing the elephant:       The phrase ""seeing the elephant"" is an Americanism (or American phrase) of the mid to late 19th century.  Seen throughout the United States in the Mexican-American War, the Texas Santa Fe Expedition, the American Civil War, the 1849 Gold Rush, and the Westward Expansion Trails (Oregon Trail, California Trail, Mormon Trail), the mythical elephant was an extremely popular way of expressing an overwhelming emotion. During the 20th century the phrase faded from popularity but when historians started taking note of its recurrence in historical newspapers, journals, and literature they often summed the elephant up too quickly and categorized it as a negative experience. Desolation and sadness may have been one trait of seeing the elephant, but it was certainly not the only or even the most prevalent. More often, American pioneers of the Overland Trails talk of the excitement and anticipation of heading west to see the elephant. Elephant ""sightings"" often begin with excitement and high ideals only to be disappointing or disenchanting. The high excitement followed by the low frustrations are what epitomize the elephant as something most wanted to ""see"" but few would have wanted to ""see"" again.

Granted, the Cold War in the '80's wasn't like the Cold War of the '60's, and I'm the first to acknowledge that.  We were never ""seconds to midnight"" like we were during the sixties.  But, I grew up with parents who were children of the sixties, and who actually went through what you went through, and who read postapocalyptic fiction.  And, I was encouraged to read, so eventually, I picked up those paperbacks that were laying around the house during the early '80's.  So, after hearing Reagan talk about ""The Evil Empire,"" I would read these trashy paperbacks under my blanket with a flashlight.    I had very vivid nightmares about the beginning/end of WW3, until the Berlin Wall fell in '89.  I can still remember the details, though I haven't had that dream since the late 90's (I remember having it once while I was in Bosnia, after the Cav guys took down a bunch of antenna sites that I don't care to look up right now, but it was very odd to wake up to that yellow-red mushroom cloud after nearly ten years, and I think that I had it once a year or so later).  It didn't help that I lived within 30 miles of a B52 base when I was that little kid, and that most of that post nuclear holocaust horror fiction had the Soviets winning the war.    Tl;DR: Fuck the guy who wrote ""CADS"" and ""The Survivalist"".  Oh, yeah, and the whole Cold War, too.  And, this was probably entirely off topic of OP's post.  Edit: It's weird to talk about.  I really never have before.  I think that I told my ex wife about it once.  I'm really more constrained by the fact that I have the wonderful excuse that I'm on my cell phone right now, and, if I sit down in front of my computer, I might be there all night.  I don't know know what professionals would call that, but the fact that I've only had it twice since the Wall fell has to account for something, right?  It was a nightly thing, and it was the same thing, every night.  I think I'm starting to recall details of it.  This is becoming a stream of consciousness rant, so, I'm out.    But, seriously, OP, thank you for sharing."
MilitaryStories,1zhl1e,brokenarrow,9,Tue Mar 4 04:11:47 2014 UTC,"It was a nightmare. I was re-reading what I wrote. The idea that the world could have tipped into nuclear war at any time with no warning, no alarming headlines, just any goddamned time at all, even right in the middle of English class... It's even hard for me to imagine. We lived right on the edge for decades. It never let up - it just got faster and more urgent, better bombers, better missiles, boomers - no second chance, no time to reconsider, push the red button now because you won't get a second chance.  I haven't felt that pressure in decades. I don't want to upset anyone's comfy cynicism, but it is way better now. I was a war savvy kid. If you had asked me back in 1964 whether we would manage to avoid a nuclear war before 1990, I would have told you - no chance. All we can hope for is that the exchange would be limited (maybe even a trip-wire mistake), and the world would wise up.  But no nuclear war? No chance.   Was I just dumb and wrong?

MilitaryStories,1zbkjl,roman_fyseek,17,Sun Mar 2 04:08:53 2014 UTC,"I knew a guy who was in so long before me he was issued a pickle suit.  This story is similar, but didn't happen to me, so take it with as many grains of salt as you please.  Ft Bragg, North Carolina, some time near the end of pickle suits.  Carebear is drunk off his ass with some friends.  Driving back on post past a mcdonalds they observe a Ronald McDonald statue that is looking at them funny.  They have drunk brain and decide to react accordingly.  They circle back around and steal this fucking burger clown and put it in the back of the pick up they are riding in.  They take it back on post.  This is pre 9-11 when the entrance to a military base was a sign, not a checkpoint.  They get Ron on post and have drunk panic.  What if someone saw us.  The bright idea of disposing of the evidence occurs and they cut up the poor clown.  They then bury the various parts around the back woods of area J.  For those who have never had the dubious honor of being stationed at Bragg, area J is a wooded area with fire breaks cris crossing through it often used as training grounds, running trails, EIB ruck march routes, and the like.  Telling a private to find the keys to area J is a common joke, like telling them to find you a box of grid squares.  I digress.  At this point, the crime has been hidden and everyone is A-ok to head to pass out time.    The next morning, our beloved Carebear is awoken by Bragg MPs pounding on his door.  Someone saw.  Someone told.  He spent the day driving around area J with MPs, digging up the (now) sad clown.  I don't remember him ever telling us what his punishment was, or anything else about the story (he had many, all hilarious), but by the time I was in the army he was one of the best damn NCOs I had ever had the honor of serving with."

MilitaryStories,1z8j1s,AnathemaMaranatha,20,Sat Mar 1 17:07:44 2014 UTC,"Tunnel rat. Very elite, in a way that the Army didn't recognize, but every grunt will salute. Takes a special soldier. Props from a fellow pseudo-grunt to your Dad.  Pistols. I was in country about a year before your Dad. I was training ARVN in the estuaries south of Hue. We couldn't get the trainee-binh sƒ©‚Äôs (soldiers) to understand that it's bad to open up on full auto at any demonstration outside your perimeter after dark, because the VC were just trying to determine your position. We also couldn't convince them not to bunch up when they moved out first thing in the AM because the VC had planted booby traps all around the same perimeter our binh sƒ©‚Äôs had lit up the night before. Those who will not accept instruction from teachers will receive instruction from the enemy.  So we had a thing we called ""the 7 AM medivac"" - you'd try to get your first cup of coffee down before you heard a ""bang!"" from just outside our night position, and it was time for an American to go guide in a medivac.  When I was in Basic, I saw my first casualty. The guys were crazy to help with pay, because you got to wear a sidearm. We all wanted to carry weapons. Well, this buck sergeant we knew was on payroll duty, and he decided that in the event of a quick-draw holdup, just having a magazine in his .45 was not fast enough. He jacked a round into the chamber, put the pistol back in his holster and promptly shot himself in the ankle and foot.  I didn't realize the impression this made on me, until after I had gone to Vietnam. My unit was the last unit to get M16's. When I couldn't borrow one off somebody else, I had to carry an M14. Those things were heavy. By the time I was in Vietnam, I was an officer, and all the ARVN officers carried a pistol. So first trip back to the battery, I ditched my M14, and checked out an M1911A1 ankle shooter. I was artillery. When was I gonna have to shoot someone?  That became an interesting question when we heard the signal for the 7 AM medivac and it was my turn. The ""bang!"" was from a fairly distant company of our training battalion. I geared up with a PRC 25, and our Bn Commander, Thi√™u t√°, assigned me a goon squad. We took off across the dry rice paddies.  The goons seemed nervous and twitchy. Huh. Maybe they knew something I didn't. They all racked their M16s, flipped safety off. Better catch up. I pulled my .45, racked a round into the chamber, flipped on the thumb safety and put it back in my holster.  Nope. My right leg had apparently gone PTSD over witnessing the mutilation of another right leg in Basic. It refused to walk under the barrel of that .45. So now I'm walking funny. The goons are looking at me like I might be drunk. My leg has stopped answering messages from my brain to quit foolin' around. I finally have to take my pistol out and hold it in my hand, which is weird and embarrassing, and I still cringe to remember the looks I was getting from the goons for the rest of the trip.  I went and scrounged and M16 the next day.  I'm sorry if this is a story-bomb. I just wanted to tell OP that his Dad could've had my pistol for keeps. But judging from the pictures, he did better than that. I wonder how my right leg feels about revolvers?"
MilitaryStories,1z8j1s,AnathemaMaranatha,8,Sat Mar 1 17:31:58 2014 UTC,"Wow!  Great stuff.  Thanks very much for telling us about this.  Dad served under a pretty awesome captain most of the time he was in country.  He earned a Bronze Star for his tunnel ratting skills.  Not that bits of ribbon and metal tell the whole story, but at least it's something.  Dad HATED working with ARVN's.  ""ARVN rilfes for sale.  Never fired.  Only dropped once."" has always been a favorite joke of his.  Your remembrances of them them largely reflect what he's told me.  I have had other sources tell of better trained, more motivated soldiers in other parts of the country who fought like madmen when defending their homes.  The rep I've heard is generally poor, though.  Kit Carson Scouts were a different matter.  Dad always had a soft spot in his heart for Kit Carson Scouts.  According to him, ""They could steal a radio and leave the music.""  At one point, there was an older Scout attached to dad's company.  Any time they took prisoners, he would hand over his weapons.  He hated the atrocities the VC committed so much that he felt like he couldn't trust himself to be armed around them.  He kept a lot of GI's safe.  Another guy with the platoon at one point was a 16 or 17 year old kid.  He still did a hell of a job.  They'd been in the boonies for a long time.  Someone, somewhere screwed up and the Army just sort of misplaced a platoon.  They ran out of food a week before they could get to a firebase.  Dad grew up in the South.  He was as comfortable in the woods when he was a little kid as he was in his home.  He knew how to live off the land.  His knowledge help his guys survive off of bamboo, bugs and a couple wild pigs.  They finally walked their way out to a firebase.  By the time they go there, the only thing open was the officer's mess.  Can't have a bunch of grungy GI's eating there.  Tran (I think that was his name) saw his GI's going hungry and decided he wasn't going to stand for it.  He showed up in a few minutes with an armload of unmarked canned food and started passing them out.  A staple of dinner a the grandparent's house was a ""salad"" that include a few shoots of canned asparagus on a leave of lettuce.  Dad hated the asparagus and was usually still sitting at the dinner table staring at it after his siblings had finished and moved on.  What does Tran hand him?  A giant can of asparagus.  Dad ate is like it was the best gourmet meal.  He's loved the stuff ever since.  Pistols and Poor Sgt.'s With Million Dollar Wounds  If he'd carried at Condition 1 (round in the chamber, cocked, safety on) he would have been fine.  He might just have done something stupid, but considering all of the other oversights and dumbassery that went on in the military during that time, he might just not have known.  I carry every day.  It doesn't translate very well to Jeff Cooper's list since I carry a double action auto, but I always carry with the hammer down on a live round.  If I need to fire, all I have to do is pull the trigger.  It removes one more step (racking the slide) without compromising my safety if I need to draw and fire.    TL:DR: I'll see your story bomb and raise you.  :)"
MilitaryStories,1z8j1s,BikerJedi,11,Sat Mar 1 19:58:19 2014 UTC,"I'll see your story bomb and raise you. :)   Counterbatteried. Serves me right.   Gotta speak up for the ARVN though. Some of them were bad. Those guys I was talking about were trainees. They learned the hard way, but they learned. My 1st Division ARVNs were as good - if not as well equipped - as any American unit I worked with.  They were loyal to Hue, not Saigon. When I heard they had been ordered during the 1975 offensive to fall back to Danang and prepare to be shipped south, I knew it was over. I think they all just went home.  I know how your Dad feels. I still take something freeze dried similar to LRRP rations camping - something with rice. Throw in some sardines in olive oil, and I'm a happy camper."

I can't put my finger on it, just a feeling if I got the urge. I broke through that feeling just once when visiting Laredo and crossed over one afternoon with a buddy and the mexican wife of his father. We were having a meal at a small little outdoor place when an old man come flying out of a dive, a bar. He was followed by a burly younger man who proceeded to absolutely stomp hell out of that old man. It was pitiful, the asskicking he received, bones were broken I am sure. I stood up, intending to intervene, the mexican gal grabbed me around the waist and in no uncertain terms told me to stay the hell out of it. My buddy also took hold of me and sat me down. Both of them told me what would have happened to me If I had got involved. Hard to swallow, but I had to sit there until the Feds showed.

I'm a military brat, and I come from a military family - four generations, nobody graduated from West Point.   But I see you popped smoke after five paragraphs, and then went dark and low. Okay then. Welcome to /r/MilitaryStories. I spent some time in a VA Psych Ward. My story starts off-topic too.   I met a hundred guys just like your Dad. Most of them had children who were suffering just as much, if not more, because of the demons they brought home with them. All of us thought we were just weak. We were all crazy with anger that we couldn't seem to do anything important, like hold a job and take care of our families. We couldn't even make those things important, because we couldn't stop making all that other stuff, stuff that shouldn't matter any more, so important. We were still at war, couldn't find our way home.  So you were in the war too, OP. It didn't stop when it stopped, it just got dropped out of the headlines. I think your story is a military story. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  If it's any comfort, this subreddit and /r/Military are all about what your Dad put you through, and what the military put him through. There are resources here, places to get help, people to tell you, with some authority, that you're not weak, that PTSD is a real thing, that it can be dealt with.  Stick around. Read. Couldn't hurt. Might help. Vent, if you need to.  There's vets and there's vets. The parent who receives that triangle flag at graveside is doing tougher service than a lot of soldiers will see on their whole tour. You too. You served.  There's a long black wall in Washington D.C. I have friends there. You should go. Say hi for me. Tell 'em I sent you. It's a nice place. Peaceful. It's your place too. It was built for you."

I too lived through that era, in the 70's and 80's. It sucked mightily. We vet's knew something was very wrong but there was no one, no organization or help of any sort available. It lead to isolation and self medicating with just the wrong substances. Add too that the country was very anti-military which resulted in more isolation and never speaking of your service. It was a hard time, quite a few didn't make it, I know it was rough on you, you were a victim of the times along with all of us. I know you suffered, for that I am sorry.  Good story, thank you for bringing it along with your unique viewpoint on the times we lived through."

Made me laugh. It's hard to explain to the young people. The part that they don't get is that it's not a metaphor. Your ass is a coward, and it has a mind of it's own. It has nothing to say to you, but it is absolutely certain that assholes have no business being close to danger. And if you expose it to danger, your ass will physically retreat up your alimentary canal and drag whatever is attached with it. There is no other feeling like it.

The only troops I saw with them besides that major were LRRP's. Well, there was a Special Forces team whose base I worked out of for a while and they had a collection of AK's and other enemy weapons, but didn't carry them. At least not that I observed while I was there. They also had a Thompson sub-machine gun which I got to shoot while there - a really heavy gun with that drum magazine, but it was sweet just the same. The ARVN on that camp were equipped with all WWII era weapons including the BAR which I also shot - now that is one hell of a weapon, shot dead on and the recoil is pretty much straight back so you could hold it on target quite well when firing (from the prone)."
MilitaryStories,1yy4yz,AnathemaMaranatha,37,Wed Feb 26 01:38:11 2014 UTC,"[Continued from OP]   We came down one steeply sloped ridge line, and instead of a muddy leech wallow, there was a mountain stream straight out of a Coors commercial. It was about 4 meters wide, crystal clear with a boulder-strewn bottom and a cool breeze flowing downhill with the water.  Suddenly all the binh sƒ©‚Äôs started shucking their web gear. They piled into the stream and started washing and doing laundry. Lieutenant H went up to talk to Thi√™u t√°. He came back with the news that Thi√™u t√° had put two companies on flank security while everyone got a bath and laundry break - HQ and the remaining company would return the favor in 40 minutes.  Good enough for me. I headed out to the middle of the stream with all of my gear. It was glorious. I started dunking everything I owned in the stream, including my rifle and ammo, and carrying it back to the bank to dry off. I washed everything, then settled down on a rock sticking up out of the stream, took my nasty pants off and started banging them on the rock and washing them in the water.   As I was doing all that, the Gunny was having an intense discussion with Lieutenant H. Gunny didn‚Äôt think there was any flank security. Lieutenant H shrugged, then sat on the bank and commenced washing his stuff. The Gunny stomped to the far bank of the stream in full battle-rattle, ruck included, and sat on a rock under a bamboo break with his boots in about 10 inches of stream.  That is the image in my head of the Gunny even now. It was a hot, sunny day. The jungle was piled right up against the stream. Gunny was on a rock streamside, bamboo overhead, with all his gear on, rifle in one hand, rifle butt in the stream. He had his helmet on and was wearing a green T-shirt and fatigue pants, Marine web gear under his ruck straps.  He was glaring at all the naked and semi-naked soldiers. The only concession he made to the miracle stream was to put one hand down in the water and then splash his neck with it. Then he carefully changed hands on his rifle, and did the same thing with his other hand. He never lost contact with his rifle.  I don‚Äôt think the Gunny was afraid we‚Äôd be attacked. I think he was unwilling to be humiliated - be a part of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) catching us - literally - with our pants down. He didn‚Äôt mind fighting. He didn‚Äôt mind dying - that was the risk you took. He did mind fighting badly and dying foolishly.  After a few minutes an ARVN Senior Sergeant in his skivies looked over at the Gunny and yelled something in Vietnamese. The Gunny was in no mood to chat. ‚ÄúKh√¥ng hi√™u‚Äù [don‚Äôt understand] he yelled back. The Sergeant yelled again and gestured at the Gunny. Gunny just looked at him.   The Vietnamese Sergeant shrugged, went back to the shore, got a US entrenching tool, turned and locked the blade sideways, grabbed the handle and splashed across the stream straight at the Gunny. The Sergeant was pretty buff, no body fat, but he was only about 5' 4"". Gunny looked at him astonished.   The Sergeant splashed up to the Gunny. He said something in Vietnamese. The Gunny said, ‚ÄúKh√¥ng fucking hi√™u damn it! Are you crazy?‚Äù Then the Vietnamese Sergeant swung the entrenching tool like an ax at the bamboo over the Gunny‚Äôs head. I saw a long piece of bamboo cartwheel out of the bamboo break and splash into the stream.   Then the Sergeant splashed back to his binh sƒ©‚Äôs on the other side of the stream saying something evidently very funny in Vietnamese. The Gunny just sat there looking surprised.  I‚Äôm not sure of that last part, because I had departed that drama for a little drama of my own. I found myself in that slo-mo place that happens when you‚Äôre riding in a crashing helicopter or a car skidding towards the edge of a cliff.  I was sitting facing downstream on a rock protruding from the water mid-stream. I had my pants, now pretty clean, but not on me. All the rest of my gear was on the bank. As I said, the stream was crystalline. I could see all the way to the bottom. On one side of my rock was something that was clearly the tail of a large, dark-emerald-green snake. On the other side was the head of the same snake, almost touching my bootless foot.   I knew a little bit about snakes. Triangular head? Yep. This is bad. I was sitting very still. I estimated the snake at about 5 feet long.  I moved in slo-mo. First my foot directly away from the snake‚Äôs head - no side to side movement - then I shifted over to the snake-tail side of the rock and sloshed away. When I felt safer, I looked back. The snake was still there, but now I could see a huge red cut where the snake was wrapped around the upstream side of my rock. The ARVN Sergeant had almost sliced him in two. He was hanging together by a shred.  Me too. Fuck this shit.  No. Fuck me. What the hell was I doing out there without my gear, not even a knife? What the hell was I thinking? Did I imagine the war would stop while I took a bath? Did I think the war wasn‚Äôt real? Might as well think bamboo vipers aren‚Äôt real. All it means is that when some viper drops in on your space, you‚Äôll lose valuable time complaining, ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be happening!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt like bamboo vipers well enough to give them that edge. I didn‚Äôt like the war either.   I moved to the bank thinking furiously as I dressed and geared up. Look at the Gunny. Top soldier. He‚Äôs careful. He keeps his gear about him. Yet, if he had stood up... Maybe that snake would‚Äôve climbed back into the bamboo. Maybe it would‚Äôve bitten him on the helmet. Maybe on the neck, and that would be all she wrote for the Gunny. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like here.  Death is here. What the hell is the matter with me that I can‚Äôt see that? Am I afraid? Well yeah, but y‚Äôknow not so much. Am I more afraid to ignore my death, let it catch me in some dumbass move and leave me forever a dead fool, good riddance? Yeah. That. Not acceptable. I need to wake the fuck up.  One of the nights around the Courvoisier, Lieutenant H had made some remark about ‚Äúhaving breakfast with your own death.‚Äù I think it was in the context that if you keep your death in sight and close about you, things like Courvoisier taste much better.   The phrase struck me as I stood streamside...‚Äùbreakfast with your own death.‚Äù I own my life. I need to own my death. I can‚Äôt let it surprise me, come out of left field. I want to see it come. I want to meet it. I‚Äôm not willing to die as a fool hiding his head in the sand, pretending it‚Äôs not real, pretending I‚Äôm immortal. My death belongs to me as much as my life. I needed to get both into some kind of order.  I sloshed back to the middle of the stream and picked up the viper with the bayoneted end of my rifle. Yeah, dead. Took the snake upstream to where the Gunny was. Maybe he wanted it. Maybe he had some Gunny Sergeant magic in his ruck that would turn the viper into a nice dinner.  If so, I‚Äôd have to eat lightly. Company was coming for breakfast tomorrow. I wanted to have an appetite.  Link to Part 2: Krait  Link to Part 3: Cobra"

MilitaryStories,1yy9jd,AnathemaMaranatha,14,Wed Feb 26 02:21:53 2014 UTC,"Holy amazement /u/AnathemaMaranatha you can WRITE! Love your stories! I hope you are saving them for posterity. Back them up, make printed copies and store them in a couple of locations.  The little green fucker not sporting a viper head - I believe it has to chew on you to inject its poison, kind of like the Coral snake. On the other hand there was another small bright green viper with a distinct arrow shaped head and I believe it was the bamboo viper.   The cobra; I met my first one while returning from a cobbled together shower point at the first place I was located at in the Delta. It was on the path not much over five feet in front of me and raised up. I slowly backed away and all was good. Scared the hell out of me. I found out the next day that there were two that hung in the area, a paired couple, not aggressive, that were left alone due to their very excellent rodent control. If you left them alone and didn't push them they wouldn't bother you. They were known as popasan and momasan.  Thanks for your stories my man - you good..!"
MilitaryStories,1yy9jd,Dittybopper,7,Wed Feb 26 05:02:05 2014 UTC,"On the other hand there was another small bright green viper with a distinct arrow shaped head and I believe it was the bamboo viper.    Dude. That emerald-green viper was wrapped all the way around a roundish rock about <holds out index fingers and tries to remember> maybe 18 inches in diameter. Pi times diameter means he was at least 4 feet. That water was really clear!  I was sorry to kill the cobra. Too bad you can't break them of that touch-strike reflex, teach them to distinguish being bumped into by a mongoose from being bumped into by a toddler. They'd make nice pets.  Maybe not. Kipling sez popasan is fine, but momsan... When Nag, the basking cobra, hears the careless foot of man, he will often wriggle sideways and avoid it if he can. But his mate makes no such motion as she camps beside the trail. For the female of the species is more deadly than the male.  Thank you for the kind words. I swear I feel like I did seven days after the Gunny gave me those pills. Purged. Relieved. So nice to have that stuff out of my head!"
MilitaryStories,1yy9jd,Dittybopper,4,Wed Feb 26 15:42:05 2014 UTC,"I believe you, four foot long. My only experiences were of shorter ones but that doesn't mean anything special.

I meant it - you are a superb writer, very visual and engaging. Keep it up, purge it out of your system. The ONE thing that helped me deal with it all was writing about it, it is great therapy."

I‚Äôll tell you why: Most American advisors were young captains with about four years service. The Vietnamese senior officers had been working at war way longer than that. It is galling to have a still wet-behind-the-ears ‚Äúadvisor‚Äù assigned to you supposedly to teach the art of modern war.   30+ years later, utilizing our vast repository of lessons learned from numerous wars, large and small, we did exactly the same thing.

MilitaryStories,1yy678,lonegun,8,Wed Feb 26 07:43:39 2014 UTC,"I confess, I had read Starship Troopers as a kid... uh more of a kid than I was then. I totally stole ""FREEZE!"" from Heinlein. It was hard for me not precede it with ""DROP AND..."", but that would've been so wrong for the situation.  Thank you for the kind words about my writing. It's hard writing non-fiction. If you don't fill in the blanks with something that seems realer, it loses truth - reads like an dull ""After Action Report."" I hope that it is obvious where I'm doing that.  Some of the stuff in quotes is absolutely word-for-word, though. I did, in fact, say ""JERSEY FREEZE!!"", not yelled - I reached down into my diaphragm and found the voice I had been using on the radio for fire missions. That's where my command voice had been hiding, I guess.  Likewise, Jersey absolutely said word-for-word, ""Like your shadow, Sir."" ""...have breakfast with your own death,"" is a real thing. And in Part 3, so help me, I actually pointed to the cobra head with the machete and said, ""Don't touch that. It can still bite."" Word for word. The grunts were staring at me with little '""'o"" mouths. That was fun.  The true speeches are little tent pegs in the stories that keep them on track. The made up dialogue is as close as my memory can get to what was said, probably parsed and chopped and edited for space. Of course, you have to leave out all the ""ums"" and ""uhs"" of real speech. Read a court transcript sometime - real life speech is Not Suitable for Literature. I um came. Uh, I saw. mmmm... eh, er... oh yuh... I conquered. does not ring down the ages.  As for my command voice in print freezing you... doubt it. I had a confrontation with a truck driver this morning trying to explain why he should stop driving across my property. He left unimpressed, I think.  So I'm guessing what froze you is the same thing that froze me. Dude, snakes!"
MilitaryStories,1yy678,lonegun,3,Wed Feb 26 15:29:28 2014 UTC,"Thank you very much for the reply.  I work the over night, and read all three parts of your story once, then a second time, and then a third time when I got home for good measure.  I'm actually a huge fan of R Heinlein, and especially Starship Troopers, maybe that's why that one line stuck out to me?  You may also be correct about the snakes, there are few animals I detest on this planet more than those slimy, slithering, poison filled tubes of nightmare inducing disgusting ness.  Again, thank you so much for the thoughtful reply, your writing is very powerful, and I very much look forward to reading more of your work in the future."

I know the area you speak of but not that well as my stomping ground were south of Naha on Torii Station (long gone). We army types avoided the Marine areas because it always lead to a fight. The only women we could meet were those B-girls in the buy-me-drinky (just way overpriced tea actually) bars. There were no Russians, East Asians, Filipino's working in them, just aisan girls in the indentured servant mode as you state.

Sometimes even with all the help and support available, and you being right there for them they will manage to do themselves in. I had that happen when I was the president of a small vietnam vets group in Kansas City back in the mid 80's. Two brothers, ex infantry in VN, one drank himself to death and us attempting to talk him into therapy, get him the help he needed. Couldn't get through to him. He died in the KC veterans hospital, his brother committed suicide a month later not long after we had ended our rotating shifts at his home looking out for him because he was a depressed alcoholic too."

She smelled clean, she was actually civilian hot, you could smell her shampoo or whatever scent it was, and it was feminine and maddening and sexy as hell.  I barely remember saluting his dog tags and boots and shit, but I remember her.  There we were, to pay our respects to D., and we were all drooling over the bugler chick.

I remember an emerging dawn once, the sky still blue-black and filled with stars but with a hint of the coming day. I was sitting in a little circular sandbag position working my radio when I felt the heat roll in and roll over me like a giant wave promising another sweltering day. I stopped searching for targets and just took it all in, silent except for some occasional whispers, coughs and equipment clanks, a Zippo lid closing in the near distance. men awakening, stirring, the sky going incrementally lighter until a purplish glow begin to define the surrounding jungle tree tops. The glow rapidly fading to a dull yellow as the infantry around me began their day. My bleary eyed partner, outlined by the sky stumbling over to relieve me at the radio as the humidity and heat built.  That image, impression followed me home and has stuck with me.

He handed me two pills and told me to chew them. Sonofagun, it worked. Almost immediately. And it worked, and worked and worked...  By the seventh day, I'm still feeling fine, but I'm gettin' a little worried. I'd been eating regularly in the interim. Where was it all going?  Things came out fine in the end. But seven days... What was that stuff? It was in a medical pill shape, medium big, about the consistency of aspirin. I was told it must've been some kind of opiate - but in pills?  I'd give worlds to know.

MilitaryStories,1yca0q,swissarmypants,25,Wed Feb 19 13:35:53 2014 UTC,"Fun story. Well told.  I was trying to hitch a ride from Danang to An Khe once. No luck. Finally the AF guy motions me over. He's got a SP4 in tow, and the both of us should go get on that plane at the far end of the field.  It's a silver plane of no make or model I've ever seen, about C123 size, no markings. We grab our gear. The plane has a nice set up fold-out steps. We go in.  Nice interior, plush seats, clean, two seats on each side of a center aisle. Clearly a civilian plane. And whatdya know? Two seats way in the back.  All the other seats are occupied by fit, American-looking guys in white shortsleeve shirts and dark pants, uniform aviator sunglasses, no facial hair. They are saying exactly nothing. They are not looking at us. They all have the same stone-faced expression.  We haul our dirty gear all the way to the back. No sound but the plane. No conversation. We sit down, and I elbow the SP4. Whispering seems appropriate, maybe even mandatory. ""This plane is full of spooks!""  He nods. We say nothing more. They let us off at An Khe, and take off flying west. Never saw them again.  The Dungeon Master says: You go into a confined space. You hear a sliding, scaly noise behind you. You turn just in time to see the tail of something black and reptilian disappearing into a hidden door.  ""What was that?""  Don't ask.  ""Am I, okay?""  Don't ask.  ""Will it come back?""  Don't ask. You should move on.  ""Am I safe here?""  No.  ""So I should just leave?""  Yes.  ""Where is it going? What does it do?""  Don't ask."

That one week, we were jumping around on a field exercise, and I screwed up my ankle on day two. Doc puts me on light duty, and myself and my kit get dropped off at the local ammo dump's guard house (two old shipping containers in the fence, with a gate between them) to, well, guard the place, together with about 4 able bodies and the same amount of cripples like yours truly. All is well, when suddenly:  Radio: G-Man? M: What up. R: Gate here, there's a guy who insists on going in, but he's not on the list. M: Have you told him to go away? R: He won't. M: I'll be right out.  So I get my crutches, get my gun, and wobble out to the gate. There's a Marder parked outside, with a guy in the driver's hatch and another guy standing at the gate.  Me: What can I do for you? Guy : What's wrong with you? M: Busted a ligament, at least the doc thinks so. What can I do for you? G: I need to pick up the 20mm at site X. M: Mind shining a light on your name and rank? Thanks, uh, Major... goes through list Sorry sir. G: What do  you mean ""sorry""? M: Like the E-2 told you, you're not on the list. I can't let you in here. G: Let me in, I need my ammo! M: Sorry sir, you are not on the list. I can only let you in if either B) I get a list with you on it or B) Someone with a rank higher than yours who IS on the list takes you in. G: Sergeant, open that gate. M(to radio): Guys, get out here. Three assorted enlisted people show up. M: Sir, please leave. You are blocking the entrance. G: Sergeant, do you want to make this official? M: Yessir Major, please leave the entrance to this ammo dump. G: I will not, you will let me in. M: Major, I have to inform you that you will be arrested if you stay here. You are also on video points to camera G: Fumes, gets in Marder, leaves.  Later that day, the battalion CO comes buy with supply, bringing back (oh, sacrilege!) some ammo not used that day. I am informed that a) Said major called him, and was very pissed off indeed, b) That CO took him down a few notches for ""fucking with my chain of command"" and c) he will sign a chit for three days off for me and my guys, as an ""attaboy"" for doing it right.  Sometimes, I actually do love my job. Playing vidya games all day, tossing a log in the stove every once in a while, and politely telling a member of the non-working class to fuck off thankyouverymuch, and getting three days off for doing so."

A friend that was a mechanic, as most of us were. A friend that just so happen share the same kitchen/bathroom as me. The rooms were all the same, had the same items we had to sign for, and his room was unlocked awaiting his arrival. We had full access to his room. I can't quite remember who had the grand idea, but we all ran with it. We decided that when he arrived at his new room it wouldn't be destroyed. No, the room would just have ‚Äúsome assembly required‚Äù. We started to disassemble everything in the room. When I say disassemble I don't mean took the back off a chair. I mean we took out every single screw, nut, bolt, cushion, arm rest, hydraulic, plastic cover, lam, even the wheels and their plastic shields were taken apart. The lamp was down to strips of wire, a metal tube and a disassembled toggle switch. However, we made sure NOTHING couldn't be reassembled with a standard issue Gerber. That day we were full of great ideas, so we aligned all of the pieces, dress right dress on his bed, from largest to smallest. Neatly in rows. Washers above corresponding bolts, shields above pieces that required shielding. We could of shrink-wrapped the bed, and sold it to Ikea. Taking apart the chair, lamp, dresser, and I believe most of the bed. We moved to the closet, and after removing the closet door, mirror, the bar, and the shelving; we managed to knock a hole in the wall of the closet. After that, we got drunk.   A few days after that. I was alone in my bedroom playing video games. Waiting for the pre-formation formation, so we can have out formation, than have out post formation formation, before we have out final accountability formation of the day so we can get ready for the release formation, pre-formation formation. Someone knocks on the door. I look through the peep hole and see an nco with two fairly large MP's accompanying him. I open the door. I ask what's going on? He looks at me and asks what's going on with my room mates bedroom? Someone had seen the room totally disassembled and rumor spread that I lost my mind. He was there with two MP's ready to take me away to Disneyland. I was held in my room as a lot of phone calls were made by me and the Sgt. I was finally released from my room/my trip to Disneyland when the others involved, +/u/CassieJK included, had to personally go confess to the CSM at the time what had happened and that I wasn't crazy.

And yeah, I've pretty much run out of the good stuff that I can remember from my time in, so I went back to my civilian days for this one.

I hear you about running out of stories.  I've got a few more deployment stories left in me, but I feel like, compared to the past decade, they're really nothing to write home about.  ""In Which Brokenarrow Gets Drunk at Club Med in Haiti"" really makes me look like a choad.  ""The Time That Brokenarrow Got and Burned His ""Dear Brokenarrow"" Letter,"" or, ""The Day That Brokenarrow Sold All of His Stamps to 1ID in Two Hours,"" or, ""That Night At The MOB Station Where We All Got Shitfaced And Made It To PT In The Morning Except For One Shitbag,"" or the equally exciting, ""In Which Brokenarrow Works All Day, Pulls CQ All Night, And Has To Work The Next Day.""  (Actually, that was a WTF moment which I do want to share, come to think of it.)  I didn't have the ""chance"" as a Reservist in Clinton's Army to come out of the Army with a bunch of stories.  It sucks, because I enjoy talking about myself, but, there's a few left in the tank.  Maybe I should create  /r/LessExcitingMilitaryStories.

MilitaryStories,1xxz08,Dittybopper,58,Sat Feb 15 01:29:34 2014 UTC,"You read it here, first.  I was 10 years old and living in Brunswick, Maine.  Right on the border of Freeport.  About 3 miles bicycle ride to L.L. Beans where I would eventually hold a seasonal job.  My cousin, Michael, had come to visit (well, his whole family did but Michael was the one who caused the coming grief).  Fireworks are illegal in Maine, at the time.  We could have snakes or sparklers but, that was all.  Michael lived in Illinois where you could own a bomb.  Michael brought me a sheet of firecrackers and a Bic lighter.  Months after they'd gone back home, I stood in the field behind my house.  I was surrounded by 200 acres of future Christmas trees.  This wasn't my parent's property.  In fact, I still don't know who owned the property.  It wasn't my neighbors so, who cares?  I was armed with my sheet of fire crackers and a lighter that I'd just figured out how to use.  BANG  Whee!  So, I lit some fire crackers and threw them like they were grenades just hungry to snatch my fingers.  Almost all of them went off but there were a few that didn't.  And, there was no way in hell that I was risking my fingers or toes to go exploring for the duds.  After consuming the sheet of firecrackers, I went searching for the few that didn't go off.  I found one and I gave it two minutes before daring to squish it into the ground.  I found another and gave it another two minutes before  HOLY SHIT  Is that smoke!?  That might be smoke!  Over there!  My dog didn't seem to care.  I cared a LOT.  I finally worked up the nerve to go look at the source of the smoke.  I was 99% certain that I was about to lose a toe and an eyeball.  But, I looked, anyway.  Yes.  It was smoke.  Not only was it smoke, it was a tiny fire!  I ran.  I ran, Forest, ran.  I ran to the pond behind my house a hundred yards from the tiny fire and I grabbed the fire extinguisher and ran back.  But, when I got back to the tiny fire, it wasn't so tiny.  And, when I looked at the fire-extinguishing implement I'd brought with me, I realized that I'd brought a slightly moist cinderblock.  I discarded it immediately and stomped on the fire.  It doubled in size instantaneously.  This wouldn't do.  I stomped the fire again and again and again and with each footprint, all I succeeded in doing was making the fire larger.  My dog was still unconcerned.  I took off running for my house.  As I burst through the door, I yelled for my mom, ""I THINK THE FIELD IS ON FIRE!""  She looked through the back window and said, ""Roman, that's miles away in Freeport.  The dump is probably just burning trash.""  And, with that, she walked away to go back to her quilting.  I stared through the back door.  ""Mom!  I really think the field is on fire!  Look!""  ""Roman,"" she said as she glance, ""Smoke can look a lot closer than it really is.""  I HAVE INSIDE INFORMATION ON THIS! But, I couldn't say that out loud.  ""Mom!"" I handed her the binoculars that my dad had gotten her for birdwatching. ""I REALLY THINK IT'S IN THE FIELD!""  ""Holy Moses, Roman! I think the field is on fire! Call the fire department!""  I grabbed the phone and realized that I had no idea what I was doing.  I dialed ""0"" and was greeted by a friendly AT&T representative.  ""Fire!""  ""What town?""  ""Brunswick!""  ""What's the address?""  ""Route 1!""  ""Route 1 is very long.  What address, sir?""  ""WE DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS! WE JUST SAY 'OLD PORTLAND ROAD'!""  ""I'll connect you.""  ""Brunswick Fire Department. How can I help you?""  ""The field is on fire!""  ""What address?""  ""WE DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS! WE'RE JUST OLD PORTLAND ROAD!""  ""We'll send somebody to look."" *click* bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  Mom tells me to call Freeport and hands me the phone book with her finger under the number.  I sweep the dial the required 5 times and the volunteer answers.  I tell him the field on the Brunswick/Freeport line is on fire.  He says, ""I'll dispatch the fire department now."" *click* bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  5 seconds later, Freeport's all-volunteer fire department arrives with an army of fire trucks, civilian vehicles, and teenagers all scrambling to put on gear and start spraying this fire.  Meanwhile, the Christmas tree farm is exploding.  Pine and fir trees are literally exploding.  Their centers are on fire and as they heat up and stretch the bark, eventually the bark fails and out comes fire and sap to set the neighboring trees on fire.  It sounds like ""WHOOOOFFF""  Fifteen minutes later, Brunswick's professional fire department arrives.  I'll grant you that there were fewer teenagers but, damn. Fifteen minutes for a 3 mile drive?  Volunteer department was here before I hung up.  (almost)  At any rate, 4 or 5 hours go by where the fire departments battle this enormous blaze that keeps moving.  I find my mom talking to the fire chief of Brunswick.  As I walk up, he is saying, ""Yes, Ma'am.  Fire can travel along root systems in the grass.  The burn at the dump in Freeport could have easily set the roots on fire for them to travel the 3 or 4 miles before finding that dry field back there.  We've got it under control so, everything should be fine.""  Fast forward 20 years.  I'm confessing to my mom.  ""You know that fire in the Christmas tree farm behind our house?""  ""Oh, yes.  I remember that.""  ""I set that. It was an accident.""  ""I know.""  ""WAT?""  ""I know.  Everybody knew.""  ""What do you mean, 'Everybody knew'.""  ""Roman... You remember the fire chief that said that fire travels on roots?""  ""Yah.""  ""He and I had just been discussing that you probably set the fire.  He was simply giving a good reason to sweep the whole thing under the rug.  Everybody knew that you set it and everybody figured it was an accident.""  ""YOU LET ME FEEL GUILTY FOR 20 SOME YEARS!?""  ""No, Roman.  YOU let you feel guilty for 20 some years."""
MilitaryStories,1xxz08,BikerJedi,17,Sat Feb 15 02:18:32 2014 UTC,"Excellent!  Mom's, gotta love them.   When I was about 11 or 12 a group of friends and I played ""Junior Marines."" At one point we had the grand idea to make napalm in glass canning jars, we'd wrap the jars with rags and set them on fire, throw the jar... the predictable result, about 2 acres of burnt scrub brush and pine trees next to our neighborhood. The fire department contained the fire pretty fast. The Junior Marines disbanded and melted into the void."

Personally, I never got around to reading any other years.  I was already bored out of my skull by reading '08 and didn't want to get sucked in to another year.

I don't know how I'm going to get illustrations into my book without offending somebody.  One part of me thinks that I should open the floor to getting as many illustrations from as many illustrators as possible and then having a vote as to which ones go into the book.  One part of me thinks that I should just contract the work out with a promise to pay if the book sells any copies.  One thing that I truly love about shitty_watercolour is just how amateurish and yet completely perfect his works turn out.  In my mind, he spends less than 30 seconds per piece and that's a huge turn-on for me.  I've got a couple of 'illustrator' friends that clearly spend hours if not days to produce stunning artwork.  That stuff has no place in any book with my name on the cover.  My other worry is that if I go the group route, I have to place all my stories somewhere where people can read them and volunteer to illustrate.  It worries me slightly that I won't sell more than a couple of copies because the digital version will already be leaked.  It never dawned on me that committing to putting out the damned book would turn into a stress moment because of my fear of hurting other people's feelings, either.  I fucking hate rejection so, I'm always terrified to impose it on somebody else.  I'm not good at saying no.  (by the way, the rest of you, please don't start forwarding me your utility bills, because I'll probably just start paying the damned things rather than being confrontational about it)  That said, do you have any samples I should be looking at?  I need to talk to a publisher about the price difference in creating a full-color book or sticking to black and white.  I suspect that the Hyperbole-and-a-Half book was not cheap to print."

MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,AnathemaMaranatha,13,Thu Feb 13 18:44:29 2014 UTC,"Hasn't change since then either. When I was an LT, my troop was on-loan to the State Department running PSD for random military and civilians attached to the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Baghdad.  The PL for one of the other Platoons got dressed-down pretty hard by a general who needed to go from the Embassy to a nearby Iraqi courthouse. It was only a few kilometers away, but downtown Baghdad was between us and in 2009 it wasn't exactly the kind of place you just wander through on a whim.  2nd3rd PLT gets word of this mission for them with maybe a couple hours notice. The guy is taking a chopper in from Victory, expecting to link up with them at the embassy and roll from there straight to the Iraqi courthouse. There's no time to lose - the bird is supposed to arrive at like 1100 and the guy's meeting is 1130. Or something. That's just enough time to make it, assuming nothing goes wrong.  So we've got SOPs about this kind of thing - and we're already bending them heavily just to pick this guy up on such short notice. No route analysis, for instance. No time to arrange for one of our usual interpreters. We usually required principal pickup to occur no later than 1 hour prior to their meeting time at the venue - more if it's far away, etc. And then he shows up late. The General's chopper doesn't arrive until 1115. No time for the usual principal briefing, he goes straight into one of the HMMWV's and they're out the ECP into midday Baghdad traffic.  Of course, he's late to his meeting with whoever the hell he was meeting with. And as soon as he was done, he laid into the PL, yelling at him for not getting him there on time. He makes that platoon drop everything, run a mission with no time to adequately prepare or plan how to do it safely, shows up late anyway and then blames the people hauling his sorry ungrateful ass through the red-zone when it takes longer than he budgeted for.  That LT did well, though. Stood there and took it all, made damn sure he was the lightning rod and his Joes never got yelled at for doing their job.  Edit: Whoops! Can't believe I mixed up which platoon was which! How quickly things go hazy!"
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,7,Thu Feb 13 20:21:11 2014 UTC,You.... You said nice things about an LT! I think I love you.

MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,4,Thu Feb 13 23:19:47 2014 UTC,"Nah - this guy was actually a pretty decent officer. And I agree -  /u/AnathemaMaranatha's stories are consistently among the best, most well-written military stories we see."

MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,4,Thu Feb 13 23:46:19 2014 UTC,"Oh no. Don't get me wrong. We deserve it. Pretty much my first 3 months with the troop seem like one giant cringe in my memory. When I think of all the stupid crap I did...  To my mind it's kinda like ""We expect a hell of a lot out of you, and we will ride you mercilessly when you fail to live up to the ideal.""  I always appreciate the comments of mouthy specialists. I figure officers too concerned with hearing the proper greeting of the day and seeing salutes at all the right times very quickly stop getting unfiltered and accurate information from the people they talk to. So please - keep taking cracks at officers - how else will they develop the thick skin they need?"
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,Dittybopper,7,Thu Feb 13 23:54:34 2014 UTC,"I got carried away. It's just been so long since anyone said anything nice about LTs... we have feelings, y'know.  Now blushable comments (thanks!) and a promotion to Captain! Never was a captain. They wanted me to stay in, and if I had, I would've been a 21 year old captain with a HS diploma. That was too WTF for me.  I have to say every SP5 I ever met was incredibly knowledgeable about some esoteric Army thing. They didn't give out SP5's very much where I was. Now that I think of it, every one of them was worth listening too, had something interesting to say that I hadn't thought of myself, and all of 'em got me in trouble.   So there's that."

MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,Dittybopper,3,Fri Feb 14 01:38:36 2014 UTC,"you I like, so no shit from me... er, Sir. Truth be told I never had a problem with officers and got along well with them during my time in. I grew up in the army, dad being a career NCO and all. I like to say I had 24 years in service when I turned 24 and got my walking papers in August of 69. A civilian for real for a change. I bolted out of the army, had it up to here so to speak. Dad always had 2lt stories, I have a few, one of my stories in /r/militarystories is about my butterbar XO in Vietnam. Perhaps a year older than me, was one year ahead of me in High School, the same HS I attended. Poor guy had a tough time building respect from a bunch of smart asses like us, it wasn't easy for him I know. Another story of mine is of our CO, a captain who ignored our advice about a bunker building project.  I just read a recent post of yours concerning the three LTs in your unit, you being one of them. Sounded to me like you found the right tone for officering, that area between being a leader who garners respect and has his ego under control so will return the respect to his men. Good on ye! That is rare."
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,5,Fri Feb 14 00:41:31 2014 UTC,Praise from a primus pilus is praise indeed. Caesar valued that more than all his laurels and awards.  Thank you. Not an LT any more. No rank among vets.
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,4,Fri Feb 14 01:09:27 2014 UTC,"Crank out another tale /u/AnathemaMaranatha - I need to be entertained... btw, I encountered a 1LT in vietnam that liked to group his 79 gunners also. I thought it a neat tactic. I carried a 79 and a .45 over there but I was not expected to do the fighting due to my job. I usually chose either a shotgun round or flechette as my first round."
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,just_foo,3,Fri Feb 14 01:35:30 2014 UTC,"Sounded to me like you found the right tone for officering, that area between being a leader who garners respect and has his ego under control so will return the respect to his men.   I like to think so, but aren't we always successful people in our own stories?  For a while, after I left my platoon an was hanging out as an XO in a different troop, I toyed with the idea of writing up a series of 'case studies' in junior officer leadership. I thought rather than focus on examples of doing it right, I'd write up all the bone-headed things I'd seen myself do and what I'd learned from them. I eventually lost interest, partly because I found that my own experiences were far from comprehensive; and also partly because some of the most important lessons were one's I'd learned from other people's mistakes - and I didn't feel comfortable writing my peers up as case studies in screwing the pooch.  Hmm. That was before I discovered reddit. Maybe I should dust the project off and try soliciting additional stories from people around here.  Anyway - thanks for the kind words. Somebody around here once used the phrase ""servant leadership"" and it's stuck me as exactly describing the way I feel about being in charge of anything. As a leader, I actually work for the guys below me far more than the other way around. I can't take credit for that, though - that's something I inherited from my dad."
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,xixoxixa,5,Fri Feb 14 01:21:21 2014 UTC,"Heh. I know. LTs get a lot of crap and there are a pretty large number of idiot LTs out there. But there are plenty of good ones, too.  It's kinda funny, in retrospect. We had 3 platoons, 2nd platoon had an LT who just wanted to be a glorified private. He'd just kinda wait for his NCOs to tell him what was going on. Fortunately, he had some damn good NCOs to keep things functioning and cover down on the planning/organizing work that this LT wasn't doing. 3rd Platoon (the subject of the above) had a pretty darn good LT, but he was hobbled by a few lazy senior NCOs in critical positions. He seemed to expend a lot of energy just to get his NCOs to carry anything out .  My commander once told be that I was like a good compromise between the other two. 2PL wanted to spend his time being told what to do by his NCOs (too passive). 3PL wanted to spend his time telling his guys what to do (micromanaging). I spent my time trying to make sure that my guys knew what to do without me or anyone else having to be there to tell them.  I have a soft spot for junior officers. Now that I'm a staff officer at BDE HQ, trying to delay the inevitable 'field-grade lobotomy', I look back at myself as a brand-new LT and I look at new LTs and I think 'how innocent and naive LTs are!'"
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,Staff_Guy,3,Thu Feb 13 23:41:10 2014 UTC,"You still in? If so stay in. Pass this stuff on. I'm not sure the military teaches command any more.   They used to teach command bearing at command schools and staff colleges. Last I heard everyone had moved on to MBA-speak and business management methods. I can't see how that gets anything done except make the Pentagon an even more Byzantine snake-pit of battling managers.  Dilbert goes to war. Yeah, that'll work.  Don't let that happen, okay?"
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,xixoxixa,2,Fri Feb 14 00:30:08 2014 UTC,"Am I in? I'm in the Guard, so yes, and no. I think the guard is to a certain extent insulated from some of the BS... very few of us view it as ""our career"", and all (well, most) of us are used to dealing with the unstructured, un-ranked civilian world. It's harder for people in leadership positions to really get that deep-seated sense of personal superiority when you know that the soldier you're talking to today may be the State Trooper who pulls you over tomorrow; or your kid's history teacher; or an HR manager at your workplace; or whatever.  I've stuck with it so far (13 years!), even though I've been sorely tempted to leave at several points, because I keep thinking that if all the good people get out, who the hell is left? It breaks my heart a little every time I see an outstanding NCO or Officer just get fed up and leave because of the BS while the window-lickers stay in. It leaves our military just that much weaker every time. I just hope we can keep enough of the talent and get rid enough of the dead-weight that we can stay effective. Some days I wonder.  I like to think I've done some good, set some junior officers on the right path, helped some good specialists become good NCOs, helped good junior NCOs become good senior NCOs - just tried to generally leave my duty position in better position than I found it. But what scares me is this: with every move, I get more cut off from the data that you need to make good decisions. Sometimes I'm afraid that there's no good solution - as a junior offcier you are right there at ground level and get all the info you need to make a difference - but don't have enough clout or authority to actually change anything. By the time you get enough authority, you're so far removed from what's actually going on that you have no idea what's really happening. (The field-grade lobotomy, the good idea fairy, whatever you want to call it.)"

I firmly believe that no matter how much shiny shit you wear, when you're wrong, you're wrong, and if nobody else is willing to tell you your wrong, then I will surely not let that opportunity go uncontested.  I will do it respectfully, with the proper courtesy, but at the end of the day, I have no problem saying 'The mission failed because you screwed up, sir.  edit to add a story:  I was running a training lane for a recent EFMB iteration.  As I'm teaching a class to a group of candidates, a group of support soldiers about 100 meters away are pissing around loud enough that it is disrupting my class.  I yell over for them to shut up, and immediately someone shoots up, yells 'WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME???'  I repeat myself, and he starts charging over.  I throw the class to my assistant and go meet this guy.  See a black bar in his chest.  Shit.  Snap to a halt, render a crisp salute, and take his berating me.  When he pauses, and asks what the fuck, I simply said 'I'm teaching a class to the candidates.  The candidates that you and your soldiers are out here to support.  You and your soldiers are fucking off loudly enough to disrupt all of us, from 100 meters away.  That is unacceptable.  I apologize if yelling offended you, but you were in the wrong.'  He get's pissy again, tells me to watch my ass, and storms off.  My OIC comes over, asked what happened, I tell him, and he responds 'Good.  Fuck him.  He's a douchebag.  You were completely right.  Carry on.'"
MilitaryStories,1xtnm6,xixoxixa,4,Fri Feb 14 00:21:36 2014 UTC,"'The mission failed because you screwed up, sir.   The problem: they will not hear you. It's not that they don't listen (though they definitely do not), but that they simply do not hear stuff like this. I am pretty confident that GOs have a switch inside their head, whenever something that does not agree with their picture of the world gets said that switch turns off their hearing. Because the words do not penetrate.   I had a boss at the Pentagon explain it to me. Generals are all in. Whatever their mission is (or whatever they think their mission is) - that is their reality. It is the most important mission, whatever they are doing is mission essential and critical for success and anything that does not fit into that picture is just not seen or heard. You can see it when they talk. Listen to stuff that our senior GO/FOs say. You can look at shit and think that there is no way in hell that the GO's words are reality are ever remotely linked. In his head, they are.  It's sort of funny scary to watch them change jobs too. One minute, this job is the most significant thing the military is doing anywhere. The next minute, it's the new job. There is no discontinuity. No consideration that both things cannot possibly be the most important at, effectively, the same time. But, again, in his head they are."

MilitaryStories,1xalj5,Dittybopper,8,Fri Feb 7 19:15:25 2014 UTC,"So, my stupid supply and service battalion headquarters company is out in the woods and digging foxholes in the stupidest of locations.  Infantry company has come over to train us and point out that our foxholes are stupid because they leave us exposed with no escape.  I attempt to point out that the major told us to put them there.  ""Well, then... I guess it's okay.  He obviously values you guys...""  So, anyway, later that evening, another infantry company is going to play the aggressor.  The company helping us re-arranges our foxholes and promises not to provide intel to the evening company but, they remind us that they will be aggressive.  The attack occurs just before sunset with a white-smoke signal.  Except it isn't white smoke.  It's fucking CS gas and it stings like a motherfucker.  Way worse than what I experienced in BCT.  I hear screams of ""GAS GAS GAS"" and I start scrambling for my mask.  Somebody grabs me by the back of the collar and starts dragging me backwards.  I'm clearly about to spend the evening being raped by the infantry platoon.  I'm honestly not that pretty but, who knows what goes through the mind of infantry.  Just then, it dawns on me that the dude dragging me backwards is saying my name.  More specifically, he's saying, ""Fyseek! Open your fucking eyes and breath.  You're out of it!""  I cautiously open my eyes and, sure enough, a white/grey cloud is slowly floating past me just off to the right.  Master Sergeant Mullen is reminding me to breath and blink.  He continues with, ""Jesus Christ, Fyseek.  They gassed us every goddamned day in Vietnam.  We would have never survived it if we had to mask up every time we saw that shit coming for us.  Learn to get out of the way.""  My other experience with CS was in Germany.  One of my best friends was the NBC NCO.  Our lockers are side-by-side in the motorpool.  One day, we're low on coffee and I see that he has some.  ""Hey, Davis.  Mind if we borrow your coffee?  I'll pick some up from the Commissary when they open.""  ""I don't have coffee.""  ""What's that?""  ""Oh! Ha!  That's CS capsules for the gas chamber.  You put them on the heater tray and light a candle under it.""  Fast forward 6 months.  Davis' locker is wide open and nobody is around.  I grab three capsules and pocket them.  Our vehicles are British deuce-in-a-half equivalents with US radio vans strapped to the back.  I walk over to Hillbish's vehicle and drop all three capsules down the window-defrost openings.  Fast forward 3 months.  I've been promoted to radio team chief.  No additional rank or pay or anything.  They just made me in charge of a radio van.  Fast forward 1 month.  Air-mission season is starting back up.  We go to the field by ourselves and relay helicopters from one site to another.  We're 15 minutes into the drive when the window starts fogging up.  There's a driver and two radio operators (myself in the middle bitch seat).  British driver reaches over and flips the heat lever to 'warm' and flips on the fan.  I hear acorns rattling against the squirrel-cage fan.  He grabs the lever that controls the direction of the heat so that it will be applied to the windshield.  The acorns sound really light.  My eye is burning like I've just put out a cigarette in it.  The acorns on the fan now sound like little scraps of plastic and at that moment, we're traveling about 50 miles an hour and all three of us start screaming.  Our eyes are on fire. Our lungs are on fire. Our skin is on fire.  I've been promoted into the very vehicle that I sabotaged and that is the story of how I CS gassed myself."
MilitaryStories,1xalj5,roman_fyseek,2,Tue Feb 11 03:47:01 2014 UTC,"Laughing here, good story. Fyseek what possessed you to drop those pellets in the truck? I have another story about gassing the CO of my unit in Vietnam. I was paying him back for dreaming up a very aggressive new deployment scheme for the DF teams. He was putting us in extraordinary dangerous situations and all we could figure as to why was to enhance his reputation with his higher ups. In my wise enlisted view too dangerous and someone (me?) was going to be hurt. So, when next we came in out of the field for a Stand Down I got rip snorting drunk and decided to pay him back with three CS grenades. The long story made short, I got away with it but he knew, he just couldn't prove it."
MilitaryStories,1xalj5,roman_fyseek,5,Tue Feb 11 13:51:08 2014 UTC,"what possessed you to drop those pellets in the truck?   Well... I had pellets and needed rid of them in an anonymous way.  I suppose that I could have just put them back but what fun is that?  Why did I pick Hillbish's vehicle?  Do you remember Schleprock from the Flinstones?  Bad luck followed him everywhere.  Bad things never happened to Schleprock.  Bad things happened to people near Schleprock.  For instance, if your radio suddenly burst into static and you could no-longer get a signal, you could reliably yell, ""Hillbish!  Get off my truck!""  You'd hear, ""Sorry,"" and the sound of him climbing down your ladder and your signal would return.  Lights in the rig going out?  Toss open the door and tell Hillbish to stand farther away from the generators.  One day, we got new vehicles and the Brits were transferring our rigs from the old trucks to the new trucks.  Three had already been transferred when the forklift driver punched a huge hole into a rig.  Everything went silent for about 3 seconds before I heard the platoon sergeant shout, ""Hillbish!  Go back to the orderly room!""  It was only fitting that I would place the capsules in his vehicle.  It was doubly fitting that it would result in gassing myself."

MilitaryStories,1xalj5,Knights-of-Ni,3,Fri Feb 7 19:50:01 2014 UTC,The holding hands thing is a part of the culture of the Mid-east.  The kissing.....maybe not so much.
MilitaryStories,1xalj5,Staff_Guy,2,Fri Feb 7 20:18:47 2014 UTC,Holding hands and the kiss was all a culture thing. I had only been in country for a few weeks at that point and I wasn't getting much sleep. They weren't making out; they were just two Officers greeting each other. It was a culture shock to me at that time but it doesn't phase me.

MilitaryStories,1xalj5,oh_three_dum_dum,3,Sat Feb 8 06:01:30 2014 UTC,My last experience with CS gas was at Camp Lejeune about a year ago. Instead of having us just hop in the gas chamber and don our masks someone thought it would be better to have us patrol through the woods and at some randomly chosen point start throwing CS grenades everywhere and cherrypicking casualties.  The only problem was that it was still early in the morning and the air was heavy and cool with almost no wind. So when they tossed the first three or four cans (that's a LOT of CS) the entire cloud drifted slowly over the road in front of the training site and stayed there. They had to call a cease-fire and divert traffic because unwitting people were getting choked out in their cars on the way to work.

The second was an E-5 drill sergeant at my second AIT. We didn't have to call him Drill Sergeant because we weren't trainees but, he was our platoon sergeant and we relished in screaming DRILL SERGEANT in his face.  That included the couple of E-6s that were reclassing with us.  And, my third favorite was an actual Basic Training drill sergeant who once stopped me to show me a massive thread on his uniform and said, ""Can I borrow your lighter?""  Without thinking, I handed him my lighter.  (we weren't allowed to smoke in Basic).  He burned the thread and handed my lighter back.  I stood completely frozen knowing it was a trick to get me to take my lighter back.  He finally tossed it at my chest and walked away.  I stood frozen for another minute before I walked away without my trap-lighter.  I bought another later."

We're told to direct our eyes back to the balloons for the claymore mine demonstration.  No sooner has the loudspeaker finished the word ""demonstration"" when the loudest boom any of us has ever heard goes off and no balloons still had their dicks.  It was all just fucking gone.  Then, we hear the whoosh  whoosh of AT4 and we can see the smoke stream and the missiles fly out to asplode against the side of the tanks.

The 442nd, beginning in 1944, fought primarily in Europe during World War II. The 442nd was a self-sufficient force, and fought with uncommon distinction in Italy, southern France, and Germany. The 442nd is considered to be the most decorated infantry regiment in the history of the United States Army. The 442nd was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations and twenty-one of its members were awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II. The 442nd's high distinction in the war and its record-setting decoration count earned it the nickname ""Purple Heart Battalion."" The 442nd Regimental Combat Team motto was, ""Go for Broke"".

MilitaryStories,1x6vb0,Knights-of-Ni,3,Thu Feb 6 18:09:00 2014 UTC,"It was a command hooch - G3 and G2 combined I guess. Lots of desk space made out of local trees, wrapped with vines. Papers everywhere - somebody had a typewriter. Didn't see any other maps, but I bet there were some.   The ARVNs were processing the information. There were MACV guys back at 1st ARVN Division HQ who would help process. There were several other command hooches in the vicinity. The sleeping hooches were further down the hill. Mess halls and supply even further downhill. Lots of Sneaky Petes on site. If they had let me know everything they found, then they would have to kill me, right? Whatever the reason, we were never told the details of what they found in those helicopter loads of papers and gear the flew out of our LZ.  There was a ton of stuff. We estimate the NVA Division had been under the canopy for about six months before Tet. They were pretty comfy. Was original triple-canopy jungle, undefoliated. Beautiful. Stupendous number of blue sweatshirts and khaki shorts in every supply hooch. Good thing too. By the time we came out of there, we were all wearing blue sweatshirts and khaki shorts. Supply was every third day, kick-out only for the maneuver companies - ammo and chow.  As I said, the place was deserted by the time we got there. This had to be April. The Battle of Hue was fought between January 30 (about a week before I got in country) and late March. The soldiers who built that complex didn't make it back.  Did we find the master plan for the January 30 assault? Maybe. I wouldn't be surprised. Certainly that model city wasn't made for Art Class. You gotta think that the plan for taking the Citadel and defending it were perfected in that hooch.  But I don't know. I was on helicopter landing duty unless we had a couple of companies out patrolling the complex. They rotated the patrolling, but they only had one artillery guy, so I went on all the patrols. Just as well. Lotta general on that LZ. Pays to be elsewhere."

I'm sure it's been declassified by now. Thanks for the post. I always look forward to your stories.  Yea, I was pretty much near the top of the flag pole when I was down range. I had the pleasure of being in Iraq and the pleasure of saluting every officer in sight! My arm got tired after a while from keeping it up so long after coming back from chow.

They used to send PX boxes to the field - toothpaste, razors, deodorant (Ha!) and lots and lots of cartons of cigarettes. These were free. In addition, C-rations used to have a mini-pack of cigarettes.  This was a stroke of genius. All of the Vietnamese who ever existed and their dogs smoke. It is a national habit. Except for North Vietnamese soldiers who have to spend six months making their way 250 miles down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They are the only Vietnamese who used to have a pack-a-day habit, or more.  By the time they got to us, they were former smokers who would go back to that cheatin', lying, cancerous whore in a New York minute. So clearly they could not detect us hosing our lungs down with sweet, sweet smoke. That just couldn't be, because that would just so inconvenient for guys who smoked. Even that tough, ex-Special Forces, Nisei Captain couldn't make the company give up cigarettes. I mean, they were in the chow, right? The Army must want us to smoke!  Me included. I smoked Hav-a-tampa cigars because they had wooden tips you could chew on, so you'd have a cigar stub in yer mouth like Sargent Rock. I was an idiot. I switched to pipes when I got home. Smoked for 30 years.   Ten years ago, when it was finally determined by She-who-must-be-obeyed that all smoking would be out in sub-zero weather, I broke my pipes on the front step.  Now, ironically, marijuana is legal where I am. Where was this law when I needed it? Now I am unwilling to put anything in my lungs. That sucks - or doesn't suck. Either way,  I can't smoke weed.

MilitaryStories,1wyohe,Knights-of-Ni,9,Tue Feb 4 13:09:38 2014 UTC,"Reminds me of the time I had to baby sit someone who was on suicide watch during reception. We had only been there a few days and I remember being in formation to make a call on a pay phone to home and some guy started screaming and crying. Later that night I was picked (lucky me!) to watch this guy to ensure that he didn't do anything. I started talking casually with him. ""So where are you from?"" and he responded ""Oh I'm from ___ (I can't remember where. It was 8 years ago). I have a nice house with two dogs and......she's going to leave me and take my two dogs and there's NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.......*insert crying and sobbing throughout the sentence""  No matter what I tried to bring up in conversation, he'd always somehow elude it to his girlfriend leaving him and how he didn't want to be in the Army. So that was a fun start to my whole Army experience.   I never understood why people were at reception if they didn't want to be in the Army in the first place. Reception wasn't that bad but I think it was when people realized that it wasn't just a bunch of guys running around saluting each other and holding rifles. You don't know what to expect until you get there but everyone knows that Basic Training isn't suppose to be fun."
MilitaryStories,1wyohe,AnathemaMaranatha,9,Tue Feb 4 13:34:29 2014 UTC,"Basic training is when you get your first clue that you ain't in Kansas any more. Mine was at Bliss in 1966. I had a little Chicago Puerto Rican gangster after me from day one. I had never known any Puerto Ricans or gangsters - no clue why my very existence seemed to piss him off.  Finally I fought him in the sandpit outside the barracks. We were allowed to do that. Technically it was ""training"" in hand-to-hand. I outreached him, and scrappy as he was, he couldn't hit me. What was clear is that he would go ballistic if he lost a fight in front of all these guys.  So the first time he got close to my jaw, I fell down. I said, ""I give up. You win."" He stood there panting and looking at me for a sec. Then I held out my hand, and he helped me up. He was like my best friend in the world after that. He kept asking who I wanted killed. I still don't understand what happened there.  That was not the weirdest thing about basic training. We had an actual gangster in the platoon. Guy's name was Cherry. He was a very short redheaded guy. He managed to corral two huge knuckledraggers from Nebraska who were dumber than doorknobs and willing to do whatever any random psychopath told them.   It was weird. When I read The Watchmen and got to the part where Rorschach dealt with the prison gang boss, I was astonished. That was Cherry. The guy started running rackets out of the platoon bay.  He also had a thing about one of the other boots, John Lopez, about as vanilla a Tejano guy as you're likely to find. Never knew what the beef was. I just noticed that Cherry's goons were always on him about one thing or another.  Woke up one morning to the sound of a loud, metallic ""WANG!"" Looked across the bay, and there's Lopez being held by Cherry's goons. Cherry is on the floor, bleeding from the head. A bunk-adapter is on the floor beside him.   Lopez is yelling, ""You gotta sleep sometime! You can't watch everybody! You wanna kill me? With all these people watching? Do you think anyone here would give a shit if I had killed you?""  He was right. Nobody would have given a shit. Not even the goons. I'd love to tell you that Lopez became a barracks room hero, but no. He just went back to being a nice guy. And Cherry went back to running rackets - but he left Lopez alone.  I'm sure there's a moral here, and if I was a better writer, I'd tell you what it is.   Naw. I'm just agreeing with OP. Some very strange characters in this man's Army. Basic is when you find out how true that is."

I also acted as the MG's handyman and helped narrate the scenarios over the radio. I graded and gave AARs to most of the whole brigade's tracks during gunnery, and I had to shoot as the PL's gunner, BC for the jump-gunner, and shoot for an ROTC cadet they let sit in and do gunnery with us.   TL;DR: I also knew my shit.   so when it came time to BC for my jump gunner, I knew the BCE grading system. you can kill trucks with HE but you can also use coax if the truck is within the textbook-stated 800m effective range of the coax for light-skinned targets.   so to save on HE ammo for more distant trucks, i had my gunner hit a truck target with coax. the BCE who graded me gigged us for using the wrong ammo. i pulled out my 3-22.1 and made him eat his own words. my gunner shot top gun in the whole company."

MilitaryStories,1wql6c,mclen,8,Sat Feb 1 22:10:28 2014 UTC,"I can help a little, here.  Picture a UAV pilot and his operator sitting side-by-side in a booth in a desert 16,000 miles from their UAV.  It's on station above a house where it's been loitering for the past 11 hours.  A phone call is received by the officer in charge.  He writes down some notes, authenticates the call using whatever means they use, and he tells his operator that he's turning away from the building so they can line up for the killchain.  At a certain distance and bearing, the pilot tells the operator to arm the weapons and laser designator.  As the alignment checks out and the missile comes online, the pilot flips his safety off and pulls the trigger that releases the hellfire into the doorway of the house that they pilot and operator have been staring at for 16 hours.  That phone call that started the killchain originated somewhere.  The president didn't call the pilot.  A 3-star didn't call the pilot.  An operations specialist received enough intel and got enough blessings by lawyers to know that the current target was in that building and confirmed by other witnesses.  The phone call, in this case, was made by OP's dad based on the phone call he'd just received before dropping off his kid at the mom's orderly room."
MilitaryStories,1wqkc1,BikerJedi,9,Sat Feb 1 17:25:13 2014 UTC,"Continued, Part Two.  The O-6 in charge of the 75th FA held a formation. (This was before the 75th FA was re-tasked and we subsequently got re-tasked from here to support the French and XVIII Airborne.) He said something like, ""You see this fucking chicken on my collar? I'm never gonna make General. I've pissed off too many people. So you guys are getting everything you need. Fuck the general orders. I'm also giving you extra water and rations, because I don't want my ass bombed. I'm glad you are here. You see this .45? Fuck the 9mm. You are officially ordered to issue small arms ammo to your soldiers."" That night we got a fair bit of rifle ammo and some ammo for the pistol and were ordered to have the weapons ready. I'm not sure what the .45 had to do with our not having small arms ammo, but whatever. Quite the character.   As it turns out, he was my dad's CO. Dad was a career field artillery NCO who was in Vietnam. Got a Bronze Star with Valor during Tet '68. He made a name for himself. But he apparently pissed off a general one day, so his final posting was to a reserve unit in Joliet, IL. What a shithole, and it was shit assignment. He was the only active duty guy there. His job was to basically run this reserve FA unit day-to-day. Dad spent a lot of time at the local Moose lodge. Fuck it. They fucked him over on his last posting, and then they wouldn't send him to war with his son. He really wasn't happy.  In case you are wondering, this general, a one-star, saw my dad in his Class A's with his ribbons and shit from Vietnam at some ceremony or some shit. He wanted the opinion of an ""old school"" kind of guy and asked him if he thought the all volunteer Army was better than the draft. Dad told him what he thought, that the draft was better. The General got mad, because he didn't want that answer, and told dad to change his opinion. I guess words were exchanged, my dad barked at the general, the general barked back, and dad got fucked when we left Germany because of it. He also never made E-8, which is some bullshit.  His unit was under strength and under equipped, so he couldn't go. And he was PISSED. I went. Uncle Bob went. Uncle Steve went. My brother's best friend Shane went. Everyone went but dad. So as the CO was walking around talking to guys, we got to shooting the shit and he found out who I was.   ""Where you from, son?""  ""Joliet, IL sir. Grew up in all over, but enlisted there.""  ""No shit! I have a unit there.""  ""Yes sir! My dad runs that unit."" Then he made the connection. He said he was mad he didn't have dad here as well. I told him most of the guys in Dad's unit were pretty worthless, and he agreed.  Anyway, after the madness was over, we spent over three days driving our asses back to KKMC. In a M163 Vulcan. That did 30-35 MPH tops. SHOOT. ME. Talk about monotony. We basically drove back along the same MSR we invaded on, back through the same fucking oil fields that were on fire, back through the same small villages, etc. It took days, and we were not allowed to stop but for fuel really.  We finally get in. I'm fucking beat - no sleep in over three days really - just an hour here and there when my fucking sorry ass gunner woke up long enough to cover for me. This was on top of only a couple of hours sleep during the 100 hour ground phase that I really hadn't recovered from yet. We got in around 0100 hours, and I wake up at 0600. Just long enough to hear the following. ""The sooner we get our vehicles cleaned, the sooner we go home."" So I grab my cover, secure my weapon, and head downstairs with the platoon. SSG stops me. ""SPC BikerJedi, you don't have to go. Get some sleep man, you look like shit."" I say ""Naw, SSG, I wanna help and get the fuck out. I wanna go home to Texas."" So off I go to the line.  So we are down cleaning the HMMWV's for the Stinger platoon, and the Vulcans for the other three platoons. So I walk up to this HMMWV. I see that at some point between the time I was on a Stinger team, and the time I got assigned to drive a Vulcan, the HMMWV's have been equipped with a brush guard. Said brush guard was held in with four pins. If you release two pins, it drops down and gives you access to the engine. Release all four, and it falls off.   At this point I'm so tired I'm practically hallucinating, swaying on my feet trying to stay awake. I remember standing there in the balmy heat of 0800 Saudi Arabia, which was roughly 500¬∞F, thinking, ""Damn, I'm fucking tired. This feels like being drunk. What the fuck is this? I can't open this shit. Lesseee....pins. Take the pins out."" Bam - that fucking thing falls on my right foot and crushes it. It seems that someone had already walked down the line and pulled the top two pins out so we could open the hood to clean the engine. My entire right toe is obliterated. The bones higher up are fractured. I went into shock immediately and felt no pain. I was wearing standard issue jungle boots. As a matter of fact, I still have the pair I wore to Iraq. No toe protection.  So I bounce over to the sidewalk, and call my buddy Andy over. I had been sent to some medical training, but as I said, I was bone tired and not thinking right. ""Andy, I think I fucked up my foot bro."" ""Take off yer boot."" When we pulled my boot off, my toe was roughly the size of the moon. It was black and purple, and the rest of my foot was rapidly turning blue. ""HOLY FUCK!"" Andy yells. He actually puked when he saw it. After he recovered, he says ""Yeah man, you are fucked up."" I get up and start walking to the HMMWV we are using for transport, and you can actually hear, and I could feel, the bones crunching together. So he loads me in and we drive to the battalion aid station.  The SPC and the SSG who see me go ""FUCK!"" and immediately ship me off to the nearest MASH. Yes, they US Army still used MASH hospitals then. No, Hawkeye and Pierce did not come and operate on me. Which is a shame, because I could have used a laugh.  About two seconds after getting there, I'm surrounded by about ten doctors, all of whom are O-4's and up. They are discussing my foot like it is a medical case that shows up in books and shit. This isn't good. I get X-Rays done. Strangely enough, I still don't hurt much.  After a bit of waiting, this O-5 doc comes up and says ""Well, you need surgery."" I'm amazed. Like, all it is, is a broken foot. WTF? ""Nope. Look here. You see this dust? That used to be the bones that formed your big toe. You need metal implants. This might end your career."" Fuck. FUCK ME!  A month prior, my high-speed ass managed to impress the right people. It seems my year in Korea had convinced me to quit being a shitbird and to soldier on properly. I was told they would help me get station of choice when I re-upped. I told them I would rather re-class into 11B and go to Airborne school. My eventual goal was to try RIP and see if I had what it took be a Ranger, but if I didn't, I would have been content to be Airborne Infantry. They agreed. My dream was fading fast. Right at that exact moment, my toe screamed ""AAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!"" They gave me some Motrin, 800mg. For those who don't know, Motrin is the only thing stocked in Army pharmacies around the world. They don't carry a single other drug other than Penicillin, which I am deathly allergic to. My sister and I have a joke about the Army and Motrin. When I got out and had all that pain at the surgery site, the Army, and later the VA, gave me 800mg of Motrin x3 daily. For years. So we joke that it is prescribed for everything.   Got a concussion? Motrin. Break a leg? Motrin. Cancer? Lots of liquid Motrin. PTSD? Motrin. Rectal bleeding? Shove some fucking Motrin up there. Decapitated? Bring in your head and we'll stitch it back on with Motrin infused thread. Your weapon malfunction? Give it Motrin. IED blew up your buddy? Tell him to take some damn Motrin. National debt too high? Make money out of Motrin.  FUCK MOTRIN. That shit ate a hole in my stomach lining and gave me an ulcer. Seriously, fuck it. Fuck it and fuck the asshat who invented it. Fuck the asshat who decided it was the new Army go-to wonder drug. Fuck.  So after waiting 30 minutes for ""the Motrin to kick in"" they finally decided I really needed something stronger. I'm not sure what they gave me, but I went to sleep that afternoon and didn't wake up until morning. Yes, I know I am contradicting myself. I don't believe the Army had anything else in stock in the pharmacy. I think they got the really good drugs from the Air Force or something.  I woke up with a couple of things in mind. Due to my extreme alcohol tolerance, I had woken up part way through the surgery. I saw a purple dragon. It was quite amazing actually. I woke up, felt them messing around with my foot, and rolled my head to the side. A very large purple dragon was coming out of the wall. I freaked out and started trying to climb off of the operating table. The surgeon is screaming. They hold me down, and gas me. I pass back out.  Now between the gas and the shit they gave me prior to surgery, they overdid it. At 20 years old, I went into cardiac arrest and almost died. I remember very clearly, or maybe I dreamed it, a nurse telling me ""BikerJedi, wake up or you will die!"" I never did get the full story - apparently the anesthesiologist responsible was pretty upset/embarrassed/whatever.   CONTINUED IN THE REPLY"
MilitaryStories,1wqkc1,Deson,10,Sat Feb 1 17:25:39 2014 UTC,"Continued, Part 3  So when I woke up, I was thinking ""WTF - why does my chest and sides hurt?"" I'm guessing CPR, but I don't know. Everything about that little episode was removed from my medical file sometime between leaving Saudi and landing back at Ft. Bliss, TX. So I can't prove it happened. And the other thing I was thinking was ""Holy shit - look at my foot."" So I had a cast part way up my leg. The toes were left exposed. There were four pins in my big toe, sticking out to the side in an ""L"" shape. And it was fucking horrible looking. I could barely see the stitches because it was so swollen and bruised. I'm in a lot of pain post-surgery. But guess what they gave me for it? Mother fucking Motrin. So my unit leaves Saudi, and I get to hang around for two weeks at the MASH unit waiting for a medevac flight home.   Back home in America, the Red Cross calls home. My mom saw the caller ID and about had a heart attack. She thought for sure I was dead. In her panic, she didn't stop to think that someone would have driven out to see her. After she picked up the phone and said hello, the first thing they told her was, ""It's OK, he is alive. Just hurt."" She lost it and started crying hysterically. So anyway, Mom and Dad and the rest are told that I'm basically OK and should be home soon.   I'm in the ward with a few other guys and one gal. Quite the group. The one NCO, an E-5, actually got hurt and was getting a Purple Heart. Anyway, he had a theory that I smashed my foot with a sledgehammer so I could go home. Never mind the fact that I didn't hurt my foot until AFTER the war was over. So he started calling me ""Sledge."" Asshole. The gal in the bed next to me was being discharged at 100% for fucking ulcers. Ulcers! I have an ulcer. It isn't something you get 100% for, but whatever. The other kid, a PFC, had some sort of accident and broke a leg. so we laid around talking and giving each other shit. At some point the CO and First SGT come see me. We were also visited by Americans who were working the Saudi oil fields. They brought us cookies and shit to say thanks. Some very nice folks. One day on a smoke break, I got to meet some SF guys from New Zealand. They were funny as hell. They were also amazed at how fucked up my foot looked. You know it is bad when special forces guys are amazed at how gruesome your wound is.  So the day comes to get me out. I was driven to an airfield, where they put me on a Huey. I had always wanted to fly on a helicopter. But I was strapped down to a cot and couldn't see shit. I was not happy. Then I get put on a C-141 Starlifter with a shitload of other wounded guys and gals. I was given some sort of sedation and able to sleep. When we land, I find out we are in Germany, and are going to the hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany. I'm excited. I still remember a bit of my German, and I'm looking forward to some beer and food. But no. Fuck you, BikerJedi.  It seems a week prior some Armored Cav guys came through on the way home and more or less destroyed the town in a drunken riot. So we are restricted to the hospital. Now I'm REALLY upset. So I find a phone, call the family to let them know I'm in Europe and I'm on the way home. The one highlight was the Swiss. I guess they wanted to remain neutral, as they always have, and so they only way they would support the effort against Iraq was to ship TONS of chocolate to the hospitals for us. So I ate about 20 pounds worth in the three days I was there. After six months of MRE's and T-Rats, it was amazing.  Leaving Germany, we land in Washington, DC. As Walter-Reed is filled to capacity, they had us that weren't hurt as badly in a school gym. Somehow I ended up talking to a group of Marines who are also dying of their unfed alcoholism. So we sneak out. We walked over a mile, me on crutches, to the nearest convenience store to buy beer. We buy some beer and smokes. Now, I can't walk on crutches and drink, so we would walk a bit, stop and chug a beer, then walk some more. By time we got back to the gym, I'm blackout drunk. Six months of no alcohol really lowered my tolerance.   Anyway, it took EIGHT more flights from DC to different Army and Air Force bases to get back to Ft. Bliss, TX. I was the last stop. Over 24 hours flying around in C-141's and C-130's. When I get home, I take 30 days medical leave. I get back to Illinois. I lay around drinking for a month, having a pity party. Buy a truck with my money I had saved. My little brother, who is now 18, drives me home to Texas and stays with me for a couple of days to help me find an apartment and shit.   The day the cast is due to come off, he comes to the hospital with me. The doc comes in, examines my foot, orders an X-Ray, then says, ""Ok, it can come off. Wait here."" At this point, my brother starts to giggle. ""What's so funny?"" He says, ""They are going to yank those pins out with pliers."" I'm like, naw, they won't do that. That shit would hurt. Sure enough, a minute later another SPC walks in with pliers. Not even a doc. I'm freaking out. He says ""Don't sweat it, you won't even feel it man. It's all good."" He grabs pin number one and rips it out. I feel the pin being pulled through the bone and out of my toe. HOLY FUCK! He pulls the other three. At this point I take a swing at him, but I fall over because, you know, big ass cast. He leaves until I calm down, then comes in and takes the cast off. They clean up the toe, give me a temporary medical profile, and I go home.  So now that I'm on profile, I can't work on the line. PT is restricted. No running, jumping, push-ups, lifting more than 20lbs. I can still do sit-ups without hurting the toe. Since I couldn't run, the LT tells me to go buy a 10-speed. When they run PT, I ride. After they get in, I go ride the circuit again. The LT says I need to ride double what they run because it is easier. Whatever - I do it. Because they had fused what was left of the bones, my toe doesn't bend at all at either joint. So when I walk, it tries to bend, but can't, and it hurts. I kind of wish they had just cut it off.  They pull me from the line until my foot heals. I needed a job. I go over to see my dad's old first SGT, who was now a brigade CSM for the Basic Training brigade that was at Ft. Bliss, and asked him for a job as an armorer or something in one of the basic training units. Alas, he was retiring in three days and couldn't help me. So the LT and another SPC and I were sitting in the office one day. I had been doing training schedules and shit to stay busy. Since I was no longer a MANPADS crewman, we had to think of a new job title.   So anyway, of them says, ""I know! You can be Operations and Security Specialist!"" Ok, sounds good to me. So over the next few months, my job morphs a bit. I'm now doing paperwork for the platoon - I'm a clerk. Also, I have to keep the LT out of trouble. He used to be an E-6, but went through Green to Gold and got a commission. So he is not only doing his job, he also keeps trying to do the platoon sergeant's job, because was an NCO for so long. I'm having to tell him every day, ""Sir, you can't do that. That is SGT so and so's job."" But they also let me help with planning FTX's and such so that I'm still part of the unit. When they go on FTX, my job is to make sure they are well supplied, then I stay back and man the fort. They never are well supplied. The LT frequently comes and says something like ""SPC BikerJedi, we need a stove and two GP Large tents. Go get them."" Or something like that. The unit is ALWAYS short something.  Now mind you, he never said how to get them. He didn't care. His exact words were, ""I don't give a damn, and I don't want to know."" So what I would do is go down to the battery motor pool, draw a truck, corral a couple of the new Privates who were scum to the rest of us because they were fresh boots with no combat patch, and drive over to brigade HQ warehouse. I would walk in like I belonged there, and say ""Get that, that and that."" No one ever asked me any questions, stopped to talk to me, wanted paperwork, or anything. I literally just walked in and stole whatever I needed for my guys.  After a few months of this, the Brigade CO, a full bird, calls a brigade formation. He was purple with rage. He ranted and raved over the microphone for almost an hour. He actually said that if he finds out who the hell is stealing from him that he is going to ""fucking shoot your sorry stealing ass"" on the spot. Myself, the LT and one or two guys in the know can't stop giggling.   CONTINUED IN THE REPLY"
MilitaryStories,1wqkc1,AnathemaMaranatha,11,Sat Feb 1 17:26:12 2014 UTC,"Continued, Final part.  The other job I had was to be the ""squad leader"" for the fifth squad in the platoon. Two kinds of people were in that squad. Those that were ETS'ing or PCS'ing, and those that were being chaptered out for DUI, drugs, being fat, etc. So I had to help the former group with whatever they needed, and babysit the other group and keep them out of trouble. How exciting. I'd love to say I have some great stories about that aspect of it, but I don't.  After ten months it becomes evident that I'm not going to be able to run again. Ever. Maybe short distances, but certainly not two miles. At this point the Army is drawing down and deactivating units, so losing me is no big deal. Had this happened during OEF or OIF, maybe they would have amputated the toe or something to keep me in. I get sent to the medical board. I am sitting in front of three full bird doctors. I am crying and begging. I tell them I'll fly a desk for the next 16 years, or to amputate the toe, anything, just don't put me out. This was my dream to be in the Army. Nope. Sorry kid. Honorable discharge under medical conditions.  A few weeks later I'm on my last day. I've cleared everything except payroll. So I head over, and they present me with a check for $9,998. HOLY SHIT. WTF is this? They tell me ""Medical separation pay."" That's it. No other explanation given. At this point I'm DEEP in depression. My divorce was finalized while I was recovering, I've lost my dream of being a career soldier, and I have zero prospects in the civilian world. All I know how to do is kill planes. I can't even get a job teaching ADA to foreign governments because I never made E-5. I'm also starting to experience some PTSD and I don't know what's wrong with me, only that I'm drinking too much. So I don't ask any questions. I buy a gun, get a tattoo, and party my ass off. The next day I drive home to Colorado. Dad has retired, and they returned to our real home.  The $10K is gone inside of about a year, if that. At some point they send me another check for $3,000 for something, I don't remember what. It goes too. At some point I call the VA and ask why I'm not getting a disability check, as I'd been discharged with 10%. They tell me that the separation pay I got was an advance on 8 years of payments to help me ""adjust"" to civilian life. In other words, I was forced to take out an 8 year loan without knowing it. (I think it was eight years, might have been more or less.) Ruh-oh. So yeah, I didn't get my first check for quite some time.  I hit some rough spots, and I fucked up majorly in a lot of ways. I eventually get my shit together. I get into Voc Rehab and got to school. Get a degree. Re-marry and have a kid. Work in IT for about ten years until the bubble burst in 2000. I was on a huge project for Lucent when they announced a quarterly loss of half a gazillion dollars. Along with every other IT company. So I was laid off and couldn't find work. I end up teaching at a tech school. I eventually make the transition to teaching high school, then middle school, which I'm still doing about ten years later. Have another kid.  My toe has been re-broken three times over the years. The last time I was complaining for almost a year that it hurt real bad, but everyone thought I was being a baby. It turns out it was broken quite badly and I had to have another surgery. The VA did it for me. Again I woke up during the surgery. This time they didn't try to kill me though. It still hurts, and I still can't run, but hey, I'm in one piece. I'm not going to complain about that.  Thanks for reading."

MilitaryStories,1wnrqp,iama_blade,2,Sat Feb 1 02:24:03 2014 UTC,"As a civilian contractor after I stopped attending the Army, I was in England doing ""Very Important Things"" to somebody's computer.  It's about 9 am and I am suddenly doubled over in pain.  There's talk of calling an ambulance but, the last thing I want is to stay in England for the next month when this TDY is only 3 days long.  I tell them that I'll be fine.  It's probably gas from poor nutrition from the plane and beer.  I walk it off for a half hour and, I'm really much better.  Next morning, I'm putting the finishing touches on this computer.  At about 9 am, I'm doubled over in pain, again.  My diet the previous night was about the same as it was the first night.  Fish and chips and beer.  Clearly, something in the fish isn't agreeing with me.  Again, I wave off assistance and just walk it off for a half hour.  Sure enough, I'm right as rain and finish my job.  They need to test the changes and monitor overnight so, the next morning, I'm checking log files and asking operators if they were satisfied with their tests.  At about 9 am, I'm doubled over in pain.  The Brit commander in charge of the place is having none of my waving off of assistance and insists that an ambulance take me to the local hospital.  I was in Molesworth at the time. I want to say that Attenburough? Altenburough?  Something like that, was the hospital. Alcenberry?  Anyway, it's 30 minutes away.  I'm fine by the time I get there.  They don't care.  I'm admitted.  I'm told to change into the assless fabric outfit that hospitals are known for.  I tell them that I really can't stay long as my flight leaves from London tomorrow morning and I will be on that flight. They make me lay on my side on the table.

MilitaryStories,1wkb66,roman_fyseek,7,Thu Jan 30 16:08:29 2014 UTC,"When I was in 7th grade, growing up in Brunswick, Maine, one day, the Principal comes to my classroom, gets the attention of our teacher and takes her into the hall.  A few seconds pass and the teacher comes back in to ask Holly, one of my best friends, hot as hell, quite possibly a giraffe, to please go with the principal.  She is never seen again.  Now, this kinda pisses me off because I spent most of my days following her like a lost puppy and, for whatever reason, it didn't creep her the fuck out.  So, a couple of days of no Holly ends with me asking my teacher what happened to her.  ""Her father died.""  ""When do you think she'll be back?""  ""She won't be back, Roman.  The Navy is returning their family to _____ wherever.""  This upsets me greatly.  Later that evening, my dad notices that I'm down and asks what's going on.  I tell him that my friend Holly's dad died and that the Navy is sending her family away.  He tells me, ""The only death that Brunswick Naval Air Station has had in the last week was... oh...""  Turns out that her dad was on the tarmac when a helicopter lost control and pitched forward wildly and the rotors completely destroyed a dude before the pilot was able to get shit shut down.  Closed casket for obvious reasons.  And, if I were to ever see Holly again, I wasn't allowed to tell her because the official story was ""Equipment failure resulting in loss of human life"" and not ""Dude obliterated by 2200RPM helicopter rotor."""

MilitaryStories,1wimsk,roman_fyseek,8,Thu Jan 30 01:26:15 2014 UTC,"I was TDY to Little Creek for 6 months.  Army guy living on a Navy base.  I've just been moved out of my private BEQ room and into a 3-person room because somebody outranked me.  I was still SPC at this point (and would never get promoted beyond CPL).  So, the day that I move into the three-person room, I'm thinking, ""Well, this isn't bad at all.  I've got 2.5 times the space and two empty racks!""  This changes shortly before midnight.  Two Marine PV2s arrive with two duffel bags each.  One on their front, one on their back.  They flip on the room light and my eyes scream but, I kept my shit together and sit upright in my bed (the non-bunk one).  They're all about ""Sorry! I didn't know anybody was in here!""  And, I'm all about, ""No big deal.  Ya'll just startled me.  Do what you guys need to do. I've got a spare pillow that I can put over my head.""  Next morning, before I wake up, they're gone but, there are locks on the two wall lockers that aren't in use.  I have no valuables that will fit in my wall locker so, I'm blowing off the rules about locking up.  So, that afternoon, I return from work around 1600 and settle onto my bunk to read a book before I head out for dinner.  The two privates come in around 1800.  Introductions are made.  They're in their A-school.  My eyes go O_o.  ""You guys stay in hotels for A-school?  Fuck, man.  I was in an 8-man squad bay and shared a single bathroom with 60 nasty motherfuckers.""  They tell me that most A-schools are like that but, Little Creek doesn't have those barracks.  Lucky for them, I think.  Just then, the door bursts open and a Marine corporal strides into the room.  The two PV2s lock up and shout ""At ease!""  Corporal looks at me and says, ""You aren't coming to parade rest?""  ""I'm the same grade as you so, it doesn't seem likely.""  ""You, what?""  ""Look, man.  You can play with your privates all day long but, I'm TDY so, leave me out of your reindeer games.  I'll stay out of your way and, everybody will be happier for it.""  So, this corporal goes through the room doing a fucking inspection.  He's pointing out dustbunnies that the maid has missed and streaks on the mirror that she's left and generally being a tool.  That said, it's the same way I was treated in my first AIT and, these guys are, after all, trainees.""  So, yeah.  For the next 2.5 months, this corporal bursts into the room at random times but, only once did he do it after 10pm.  ""LISTEN UP, CORPORAL DUDEBAG.  IT IS ONE THING FOR YOU TO DO EVENING INSPECTIONS BUT, YOU WILL NOT CHARGE INTO MY GODDAMNED TDY ROOM AND START SHOUTING.  I HAVE A FUCKING JOB TO DO TOMORROW AND YOU WILL NOT BE FUCKING WITH ME WHILE YOU FUCK WITH THEM.  Do that shit on your time, not mine.""  The dude would only show up around 1800 from then on out.  I like to think that I made a world of difference in those to PV2s A-school experience.  In hindsight, it probably cost them both dearly when they got assigned to wherever they were going."

MilitaryStories,1wdmnh,sheepdog3,24,Tue Jan 28 16:12:54 2014 UTC,I love how people lose their minds when you realize you're not intimidated by them at all. It's always straight to screaming with nothing in between to establish why a person is fucked up and whether or not they know it.
MilitaryStories,1wdmnh,oh_three_dum_dum,13,Tue Jan 28 16:59:03 2014 UTC,I got a kick out of it.
MilitaryStories,1wdmnh,twiztedstudiez,9,Tue Jan 28 18:02:42 2014 UTC,Seriously. I listened and cared what the higher ranks had to say when they were human. Screaming and spitting just turned things into a joke.
MilitaryStories,1wcyd1,xixoxixa,4,Tue Jan 28 08:55:51 2014 UTC,"16 hours, goddamn. that's that oldschool army, there.   one time our battalion-level 18-mile ruckmarch turned into a 26-miler because the battalion scout platoon, who were leading the effort, got lost and we had to make a giant loop-de-loop to turn around and get back on-track. but 16 hours? anybody go down as a heat casualty?"

I didn't trust that shit so I never wore it when I'd go to Camp Cupcake."
MilitaryStories,1wcyd1,twiztedstudiez,3,Fri Feb 14 22:04:48 2014 UTC,Great story and I am sure that this tale will remind everyone of some forgotten horrible march they once were on. Thanks for reminding me of mine.

MilitaryStories,1wc8l6,Maryland173,8,Tue Jan 28 02:57:07 2014 UTC,Thanks for sharing your memories.
MilitaryStories,1wc8l6,Still-alive,5,Tue Jan 28 03:12:35 2014 UTC,"We had a great company of leaders the type you would follow to hell while wearing a light coat of gasoline. It was more of a family than a company.   I miss this about my paratrooper days.  The guys I was with at Bragg have all said that after our little group parted ways they've never had that family feeling again in the Army.  We set up a Facebook group as a digital ORP for us all to maintain positive contact.  Actually helped us save a brother that was suicidal a few months ago.  All the way, paratrooper.  All the way."
MilitaryStories,1wc8l6,xixoxixa,2,Tue Jan 28 07:07:56 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Makes you forget all those days of 12 hours in the harness for a jump. All the way!

MilitaryStories,1wc8l6,twiztedstudiez,3,Tue Jan 28 23:21:27 2014 UTC,Thank you very much for the story! It's good to read stories like this. Not everything is fun in games in the end but I still enjoy them. I thought it was written well as well. I'm hoping that other stories such as this will help others get comfortable enough to write even if they think they're not the best at it. We're not here to judge your writing abilities.

MilitaryStories,1wc24p,ChongoFuck,7,Tue Jan 28 06:12:13 2014 UTC,"For the love of all that is good and holy (and holey), I am not in a competition.  All of you are telling wonderful tales and they're taking me back and making me sweat and flinch and weep and all the stuff that great story-tellers are supposed to do.  This was a great story!  I'll let you in on a secret.  For the last week or so, I've been following a formula from a TED video about story-telling.  It is provided here:   Make a promise Make the reader care Hide the fact that the audience is working for their meal Don't give the audience 4, give them 2+2 Have a punchline   The difference that you all saw in the early days of my story-telling weren't because I'm a great story-teller compared to the rest of the stories you saw in /r/Military. It was because I'm long-winded.  I'll let you in on another thing that I do (that an author that I love does [although, I was doing this in my stories before I ever knew that Neal Stephenson even existed]): I backtrack and tell side stories.  I have a long list of stories to tell.  Not all of them related to military.  Some of them will require a blessing from my most-recent ex-wife because they don't always show her in the best light and the divorce decree specifically says that I need her permission before telling certain tales to the public or the internet (no joke).  So, this long list of stories, some of the stories are very short and as I remember them, I add them to the list and I write them down.  Then, later on, as I'm telling another story, I glance at the list and decide which side-stories will illustrate or distract or whatever thing I need to incorporate.  And, you, sir, have already done that beautifully by marching straight at the civilians and explaining just what it was you were describing so that the civilians, newbs, and those that had never been to NTC could generate a picture in their mind.  You, and everybody else who is posting their stories should be proud motherfuckers.  Keep it up."
MilitaryStories,1wc24p,roman_fyseek,4,Tue Jan 28 23:49:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks, /u/roman_fyseek. I appreciate it. I've always thought I've had a bit of a talent for writing, but I don't get enough time to practice. You, by making me laugh hysterically, brought it out. I'm working on a few others. I enjoy telling them, it's fun to re-live it."
MilitaryStories,1wc24p,roman_fyseek,5,Wed Jan 29 01:01:27 2014 UTC,"My advice is once you write it, re-read it as though you've never heard the story.  You'll find your gaps and redundancies.  My first-drafts are cringe-worthy (most of the time) because I leave gaping holes where the reader would surely break a leg.  I don't have enough income to get sued for that kind of shit.  You might also find that you can re-arrange things, not so that they change the order of events but, so that you don't have to explain things twice.  (You didn't. I'm just telling you what I find when I re-read my stories before hitting the save button in openoffice)."
MilitaryStories,1wc24p,Roo_Rocket,5,Wed Jan 29 01:09:45 2014 UTC,"Good advice. Honestly, I wrote it, and before I posted, I decided to edit. That probably would have worked well, but I had many, many ounces of bourbon on ice. Then I got distracted by eBay and some compulsive shopping, then came back to the story. Then ran out of bourbon. Then I cried. Then I remembered I had vodka and juice. Then I made the fatal mistake of mixing liquor. Ugh.  Anyway, seriously, thanks for the inspiration to write again. It's been a while."

MilitaryStories,1wc3bk,Soda241,4,Tue Jan 28 03:30:47 2014 UTC,And I thought my job of shredding unlimited amounts of paperwork was boring.
MilitaryStories,1wc3bk,twiztedstudiez,5,Tue Jan 28 05:01:21 2014 UTC,"I don't know if anybody has taught you how to do efficient shredding so, I'm going to share.  So, you're faced with a mountain of shredding.  Here's how to get through it.  First, separate it into two piles.  One pile with no staples, the other pile with staples, all aligned so that the staples are in approximately the same position as the others.  Now, on your staples pile, go bundle-by-bundle ripping corners off.  This should only remove enough material to get the staple separate from the majority of the paper.  Add those recently-destapled bundles to the no-staple pile.  Once you've finished, we get to the fun part.  Grab a bundle of paper approximately the size of a pack of copy paper or smaller.  Square the edges so that it is as neat as possible.  Grab the top of this bundle of paper with your dominant hand and your dominant forearm under the pile. Then, relax your grip on the paper.  As you relax your grip, use your other hand to slope the back edge of the bundle away from you.  When you do this, the bundle should now look like this: (you) _/===/  Now, stand in front of the shredder and turn it on.  Lick the fingers of your free hand and feed the top sheet of your bundle into the shredder.  Get ready to be quick about this because before the first sheet is a quarter of the way off the stack, you need to feed the next sheet forward under the first so that it gets sucked into the shredder.  Continue feeding sheets from the top of the pile under the sheets that are going into the shredder and you can fill the shredder bag in minutes and destroy any and all evidence.  When you are down to your last few dozen sheets of paper, switch to doing one sheet at a time while you toss in the staple corners.  They'll sound like CHUNK as the shredder blades go through them."
MilitaryStories,1wc3bk,roman_fyseek,1 point,Tue Jan 28 21:27:50 2014 UTC,"Well, it was either shredding or some other brain numbing job. At the time I'm sure I found the most inefficient way possible to shred loads of documents just so it would take longer. Nobody ever complained as long as I got it finished. There was another job where I had to load and pack ice for hours (like the ice you get at a gas station)."

The 4Runner 3vze is a monster pain in the ass.  You can't do shit to that engine without either disassembling the entire top half or the entire front end, or in my case, both the top half and the front end because I need to replace an exhaust valve.

MilitaryStories,1waojr,dennington111,9,Fri Feb 21 10:10:07 2014 UTC,"I was set up in one radio van while another radio van on a different network was set up about 300 yards away.  We're otherwise alone in a huge empty parking lot.  The other radio operators are buddies with us.  They just run a different net so, they chose to set up in the same location as us.  So, one evening, I'm walking over to their site with steaks for the grill.  I see white.  White on everything.  A little gust of wind picks some up and sets it back down and now I have the taste of salt/baking soda in my mouth.  ""Oooh... Fire extinguisher!""  Needless to say, we held the bar-b-q over at my site rather than risking our steaks tasting like fire extinguisher.  Turns out that they had a small fire that rapidly became a big fire when it climbed up the 5 gallon gas can and a jet of flame started shooting out the open top.  One of them told the other, ""Put the cap on it!""  The other was wise enough to not follow directions and instead used the fire extinguisher.  What he didn't know at the time is that the fire extinguisher valve was going to remain open so, once he put out the fire and released the handle, the extinguisher just continued blowing out white until it was exhausted.  What makes this all suck is that his superiors tried to charge him with destruction of property and wanted him to pay for the fire extinguisher.  When it was finally beaten into their skulls that 1) The fire extinguisher's job is to put out fire so that it doesn't burn down the generators, radios, and vehicle and 2) The lesson that would be sent was, ""If you have a fire, best bet is to move the fire extinguisher as far away as possible so that it doesn't get used or you'll be charged with its destruction.""
