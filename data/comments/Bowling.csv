Bowling,3e6vtz,mmburns83,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:28:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he picked a generic layout for your ball.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it sounds like it may be lazy.  Yes, it can be re-drilled, but based on where the center of gravity is laid out, it may work just fine.    Have you thrown it yet?  Does it finish?  Do you throw the ball consistently enough to have a precise PAP?  These questions can help us help you work through it."
Bowling,3e6vtz,redsox113,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response :)  I threw 4 games with it, center of gravity is halfway between thumb and ring.    With my old ball I would stand about a foot behind the back dots (I have a long stride) between the second and third dots from the left and throw for between the second and third arrows from the right. The problem is is that I really had to crank it to get it to hit the pocket right, which is why i decided I needed a new ball. I wanted something that would react the same with less effort. Last night doing this with the new ball was just a mess. I moved all over the place trying to find the right spot and settled on a foot forward a couple boards to the right and throwing for the second arrow but still having to put a lot of force behind it.   With my old ball my average was between 150 and 160, my high last night was a 125. I understand that there going to be a little bit of adjusting to a new ball but I don't feel like i should have to throw it so hard to make it react right."
Bowling,3e6vtz,redsox113,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"You've got a ball that's a whole hell of a lot stronger than your old one.  It's going to take some significant practice and adjustment to get a hold of it.    Practice some more with the ball before making a decision.  And under all circumstance do not watch your score.  Shoot at your marks and watch where the ball reacts on the lane.  Watch how far the ball rolls down the lane before it starts to turn.  Take videos.  Try different angles.  Does the ball feel comfortable?  Do you know what the ball is going to do when it leaves your hand?  I don't mean strike.  I mean does the ball hit your target, does the ball turn at the break point, does the ball turn up into the pocket on its axis, or does it skid into the pocket while still trying to roll.    You've upgraded from a '95 Chevy Cavalier that got the job done to a '12 WRX (I think that's apt, I'm not much of a car guy).  Both will get you work, but in very different ways and it'll take some time to hammer out the details.    I saw this all the time working in a pro-shop.  I was popular for people who wanted their next ball, upgrading from entry level to performance, and I needed to harp that it took time to develop the consistency and accuracy required with a performance ball.  Your scores may drop for a while until you know how the ball is going to react and until you know how to know what the ball will do out of your hand.    I think for now it's less the layout that is a concern and more getting used to a new ball."
Bowling,3e6vtz,redsox113,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that actually kinda makes me feel a little better. I didn't think I would improve right after getting a new ball, just didn't think that I would get worse. So in my head I was seeing bad ball equals good score, better ball should equal good score, not worse score, there must be a problem. And 4 games is probably a bit soon to throw a hissy fit lol but I paid good money for it and wanted to make sure it was done right."
Bowling,3e6vtz,kopking666,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Your concerns are warranted.  You just paid I'm guessing around $200 for a ball and watching your scores drop can be immediately disheartening.  Focus on the ball, lane, and your shot instead of the score.  You'll get there soon!"
Bowling,3e6vtz,Storm301,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"i always think you should have different layouts on balls anyway, pin up will give you better length and will turn a little later than your other ball, most people like the pin up layout as you tend to get a sharper reaction on the backend. I doubt you'll have any problems, my pso asks what I want from the ball and he drills it to suit, so unless you know exactly what reaction you want from the ball then I say just trust your pso."
Bowling,3e6vtz,SeekingMorrow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:37:29 2015 UTC,I would like to trust him but my brother got a ball drilled by him with the same lay out. I use my thumb and he doesn't. I would think that that would make a huge difference on how you would drill a ball. It just felt like a cookie cutter drill.
Bowling,3e6vtz,SeekingMorrow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"I've got bad news, and some not so good news, but not as bad.  The bad news is your PSO definitely needs to know your PAP in order to properly drill a ball. It's the most important aspect of picking the layout on a ball. If they don't take 2minutes to watch you throw a ball, stick a piece of tape on the pap, and then watch you throw it again to make sure it's the right spot then they either know nothing about drilling other than putting holes in a ball, or they really don't care about your ball.  the not so bad news is that on a symmetrical ball, simply the distance from the pin to PAP is by far the most important aspect, and pin under/pin over doesn't make much impact so it's a little bit more likely you can just ""get lucky"" with a generic layout.  Since the ball is already drilled you might as well keep bowling with it, and see if you like the reaction, if you don't it may be worth having a more knowledgeable pro shop operator check it out and figure out if what you don't like about the ball could be related to the drilling.  also, you can figure out your PAP yourself pretty easily. throw the ball and look at the oil rings in your track. the one you're concerned with is the first track closest to your fingers. from there visualize a ring around the ball on that track, and your pap is the point on the ball that would be in the dead center of that ring. stick a piece of tape over that spot and throw the ball again, if the ball spins around the piece of tape in the front of the lane, thats your PAP."
Bowling,3e6vtz,SeekingMorrow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:43:27 2015 UTC,My problem is that there are 3 pro shops in the area and he runs all 3. Guess there's some sort of shortage on people who want to learn the art.   Thanks for the advice though.

Bowling,3e41w3,JoyfulBanana,3,Tue Jul 21 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"Just go to the pro shop and ask questions, usually it goes like this:   The person at pro shop watch you bowl a few shots. Pro shop person will tell you their opinion on your style and recommend a few balls. Ask if you can try one (I'm not sure about this but the one that I used to go to have a drilled one for nearly all the balls on the shelf). If they have it, try it out, tell them how you feel (Did you like how the ball goes? The hook? etc). Then go home and do research on the balls that were recommended/ you tried. Don't rush to a buy, remember that a bowling ball is something you will use for a long time, make sure it fits. Decide and let them drill it, then try it, don't like it? Tell them what's wrong. Make sure that you get the most out of it.   If you want to ask anything, ask, most good pro shops really like to help. Don't act like you know everything, if you don't know what they are talking about, ask again. Also, take what they told you, go home and look it up, yes, people does lies sometimes and there were cases where pro shops set people up to buy extra stuffs (Thumb slugs, name engraving, etc...) so don't trust them 100% .  Overall, just go and have fun, it takes more than 1 day to buy a ball so don't rush it. As I said before, a bowling ball stay with you for a long time, so make sure you get the perfect fit."
Bowling,3e41w3,Azy_Tazer,4,Tue Jul 21 21:16:01 2015 UTC,I actually like having thumb slugs. It feels smoother than gripping directly on filler material. Engraving otoh.. Agreed. Total rip off.

Bowling,3e3s14,JackMcDanger,6,Tue Jul 21 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"Its really just the right handers giving some jealous (for lack of a better word) ribbing for perceived advantages for left handers. Because there are much fewer left handed bowlers than right handed (there are rarely more than one or two lefties on a pair on a given night), their side of the lane doesn't really break down, at least not nearly to the extent that the right side does. This means that lefties have to make far fewer adjustments once they find a line and therefore its considered ""easier"" for them.  I say all of this based on a THS. Sport shots are a different animal, as the lack of breakdown can actually makes things more difficult on lefties."
Bowling,3e3s14,munsen488,4,Tue Jul 21 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"I say all of this based on a THS. Sport shots are a different animal, as the lack of breakdown can actually makes things more difficult on lefties.   As a lefty, I can confirm this...especially on the long sport patterns. While all of the righties would start to get some miss room and hook on their side, I was still playing it like it was the first game and leaving corners.  For THS, I have yet to see this supposed advantage I have. I'm only a ~195 average bowler, and I see plenty of right handed people with at least 20 pins on me in my leagues. :-/"

Bowling,3e3s14,found_in_the_alps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:26 2015 UTC,It can be done but you either need to increase speed or lower revs as the shot breaks down. Lefties don't really have this problem. If you get 2 or 3 lefties on the same pair typically thru all struggle hard on games 2 and 3.

Bowling,3e1a33,onewing_z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:25 2015 UTC,I like using thumb tape on anything that feels like it might be a bit off with my skin. Most recently I had a small cat scratch on the back of my thumb. Some blue tape worked great.
Bowling,3e1a33,onewing_z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:34 2015 UTC,I've tried that before but whenever I use any type of tape on my hand it always alters my release.
Bowling,3e1a33,xDirtyyyy,4,Tue Jul 21 04:48:55 2015 UTC,Maybe try opening up the hole to allow for the tape to not affect the release? There really aren't any ways of preventing that damage without changing your release or putting something on your thumb or thumb hole that might change your release.
Bowling,3e1a33,xDirtyyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"This used to happen to me almost all the time because of the amount of practice and league I was doing at the time. Last summer I did the only league I could at my bowling alley, which was non-sanctioned, so I used that time during the summer to practice without using a thumb. So if you're willing to make a big enough change to your technique, you can try changing your technique. Although, ever since I've changed techniques, I cannot bowl with my thumb anymore and there are disadvantages so choose wisely. That was my permanent solution to this problem. A temporary one would be to get the liquid skin stuff you can put over the spots that do this to you and bowl while that stuff is on. Worked wonders for me during days where I had league, practice, and a tournament going on."
Bowling,3e1a33,redsox113,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain that's the correct route for me. I'm 2 handed and use my thumb which also allows me to have the flare hole on most of my equipment. I have bowled before without my thumb, usually when this would happen but didn't really like the way I came out of the ball."
Bowling,3e29gc,swnsorp09,4,Tue Jul 21 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"More and more I am convinced that the white (textured) tape inserts are meant to only be used on the pad-side of the thumb.  I had been bowling with it in the rear for ~20 years and recently decided to redo my thumb slug to a snugger fit. I was amazed at how well my thumb held up without any tape in the ball at all. I would suggest getting your thumb slug redone (~$10) to be a bit snugger than your current set up. Then, get yourself some 150-grit sandpaper (pretty standard for prepping a paint job; check the paint section of home depot) and practice and sand out the areas giving you the worst friction. This is basically you fine-tuning the thumb hole to be exactly what you need."
Bowling,3e29gc,kainsavage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:44 2015 UTC,I agree. Sounds like an improperly fitted thumb
Bowling,3e29gc,562dreezy,3,Tue Jul 21 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm pretty new to bowling as well 6ish months. I've been having thumb problems for 5 and a half months. My break came a couple weeks ago after I had to keep opening my hole due to swelling; it doesnt help that New Orleans has a heat index of 102°+. I've learned I cant deal with tape, rips my skin and it's uncomfortable. If you slide right out of your hole to begin with blow in the hole.  You heard me right, if it's bigger than supposed to be blow for moisture before every shot. Pros do it and it gives that little extra grip. I blow then stick my thumb in and out until it feels just nice and snug, but not too tight. Does wonders for my game. Then when your thumb swells dont blow. I'm new so no professional advice here, just what my PSO told me. By the way, your thumb pad isn't supposed to touch the ball. I try to think of it curving my thumb up in the ball not gripping. Your first crease on the inside of your thumb should touch the inside of the ball, also PSO advice."
Bowling,3e29gc,justtravisty,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:16 2015 UTC,"What kind of tape are you using in the thumb and where are you placing it?  For the people who have trouble getting their thumbs out, I always recommend a fully adjustable wrist guard (the metal kind)..  It does wonders.   A video would probably help, but I'm going to assume that you're likely breaking your wrist near the bottom of the swing causing your thumb to try to exit at an awkward angle causing it to hang up in the ball. Either you can try cocking your wrist more, or use the wrist guard for a month or two until you get the feel for how it should be coming off your hand."
Bowling,3e29gc,Fulmersbelly,2,Tue Jul 21 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"I have real bowlers tape. I have tried placing tape in the front, back, and both sides of the thumb. I definitely get the feeling that the ball is going to roll off my hand at the bottom of the swing and I have to squeeze to keep it on or just let it fall off. I'm amazed at people that can keep there hands under the ball with a straight arm. I have tried to work on the push away but the only way I can keep my hand under the ball is to bend my elbow a lot and cup my wrist (basically bowling without my thumb). I get a ton of revs but 12 MPH makes it hard to hit the pocket. I should try the wrist guard. I have always avoided it because I'm a bit vain and feel like I am a strong enough guy that I shouldn't need it and I have heard enough people trash talk bowlers that use the wrist devices."
Bowling,3e29gc,Fulmersbelly,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:24 2015 UTC,"My current set up is white tape in the back of the thumb along with what's called ""timing tape"" over here in Asia. It's basically similar to the Hada patch. This keeps it from ripping up my thumb.   Another thing to try is to use white tape in the back to get it pretty snug, then one layer of black tape. That stuff is crazy slick especially when combined with the timing tape."
Bowling,3e29gc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:33 2015 UTC,I didn't have any of that tape yesterday but I have used the red tape from vise on my thumb. It helps keep my thumb from ripping but I still have trouble. When I use the thumb tape I still drop the ball if i don't squeeze. If I do squeeze the tape helps me to not hang but I still can't seem to keep my hand under the ball and I get nothing on the ball. If I add real bowlers tape to the thumb hole I actually have trouble getting ym thumb all the way into the hole.
Bowling,3e29gc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:00 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're trying to combine your old style with your new.  You're just not going to be able to keep the same revs/speed with a one-handed technique, as you did with a two-handed.    Don't think about keeping your hand under the ball as much as behind it.  White tape on the pad of your thumb will help with grip.  Black tape on the back of the thumb will help with snugness and fit.  If you're hanging in the ball after you've got the feel right, you may have a pitch issue in your thumb hole."
Bowling,3e29gc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:37 2015 UTC,"What you said is the hardest part. ""If you're hanging in the ball after you've got the feel right""... problem is that I have no idea how it is suppose to feel. Everything I read/watch says it should be snug but not too tight. No matter how tight I get the thumbhole it feels like it is going to roll of my thumb and then I have to squeeze to hold on. I always hear that you should be able to swing the ball with very little grip pressure and I have never been able to experience this."
Bowling,3e29gc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"Put your hand in the ball, then just let it hang at your side.  It should stay on your hand without you having to grip it.  You should be able to shake it around a little bit, which will cause it to fall off your hand.  If the ball falls off your hand while it's hanging at your side, it's too loose.  If you can't shake it free of your hand, it's too tight."
Bowling,3e29gc,Yabba_Dabba_Doofus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:27 2015 UTC,I will try this again. I heard this and tried it when I first had my ball drilled. I tried to shake the ball off without any tape at all and it didn't come off. The ball kinda rolls down my thumb and gets stuck between the joints of my thumb. The thumb hole has no pitch(std pitch). I just figured I was doing it wrong. Maybe I need reverse pitch to help me clear the thumb better.
Bowling,3e29gc,calabresi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:04 2015 UTC,"If you can't shake it off, the next step is to try swinging it back and forth, and seeing if it comes off that way.  If it doesn't, then continue swinging it higher and higher, until it does."

Bowling,3dundy,akimbojimbo229,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this write-up! Just one question: I always thought more track flare meant smoother reaction, and less flare meant more length and greater backend. Am I just way off base here?"
Bowling,3dundy,efads,2,Sun Jul 19 19:04:48 2015 UTC,Actually now that I look at it I'm not sure what I was thinking there... more flare means a stronger reaction while less flare means better energy conservation. I'll update that accordingly. Thanks! :)
Bowling,3dundy,abenaki127,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:48 2015 UTC,The differential is the high rg minus the low rg. So a higher rg would take longer before it stabilizes right? Wouldn't this create more downlane motion than a ball with a lower differential? Isn't that why something like the Iq tour solid is such a smooth ball. It's a low rg low differential ball with a strong solid cover?
Bowling,3dundy,abenaki127,2,Sun Jul 19 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"RG and differential are two different numbers... they're somewhat related but a low RG doesn't necessarily mean a low differential and vice versa. Low RG means that the ball will read more quickly (or stabilize quicker) and roll up sooner, while High RG means that the ball will retain energy longer before stabilizing. Differential more affects the shape of the hook once the ball starts to read the lane... low differential = less flare = more angular, while high differential = more flare = smoother.  I found a couple of articles from bowlingball.com that should help explain this a bit more: article one and article two.  To answer your question about the IQ Tour Solid, that ball has a decently strong reactive cover paired with a core that has a low RG (2.49"") and low-moderate differential (0.029) with a 15-pound ball. My next article will explain this interaction in more detail, but when you have a fairly shiny finish on a solid reactive ball with a low-RG core and moderate differential then you'll get a very smooth, strong arc off of dry boards.  That help?"
Bowling,3dundy,abenaki127,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:50:56 2015 UTC,I was not trying to correlate differential being dependent on rg. I was trying to say that the differential between the highest point of the RG and the lowest point. Meaning a core with a 2.48 rg and .029 diff (iq) should stabilize quicker and be smoother versus a core with a 2.48 rg and .054 rg (marvel I believe). This is because the high differential ball takes longer to reach its low rg point.
Bowling,3dundy,Widdox,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I see what you're saying now... yes, the lower differential will stabilize faster once it starts stabilizing. The downside is that the process from when the ball starts to transition from skid to roll will be quicker, so if you get it started too early you might lose some backend pop, while higher differential balls would spread out that transition time from skid to roll a bit more, helping to preserve a bit more energy in some situations. Both definitely have their place, as the Marvel and IQ Tour are both fantastic pieces of equipment. :)"
Bowling,3dundy,Fulmersbelly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"I've only ever thrown the tour solid as the marvel came out before I understood much about bowling on general. They were just good examples and since most people love storm I thought it'd be a good parallel haha. If you decide to do one of these about layouts and want any info on the dual angle system let me know, I've got some background with it. I mainly just lurk around the sub though except for things like these."
Bowling,3dundy,KeNdEbEaStO,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was actually a great example to pick - well played :)  I'm trying to figure out when to talk about layouts and how that affects ball reaction... my thinking was to use this post to set up another one about how the combination of layout, surface preparation, coverstock, and core combine to create a ball reaction, so I guess it'd be in there. I have a decent grasp (I think?) on the dual-angle system, but if you've got more info feel free to PM me. Thanks!"

Bowling,3dsr9u,bjones83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:31:55 2015 UTC,The main house I bowl at my speed varies from 17 (too high for me) to 13 (too low). The sensors are not super accurate and should not be relied on. If it doesn't feel slow then don't worry about it. If it does then maybe you've got too much hand in the ball.

Staten Island has two (I grew up on SI and at 25 I remember when we had 5), but Country Lanes is hands down the best bowling alley in the city by a wide margin. They are the prototype for how to cater to the modern boutique crowd and the sport of bowling crowd and should be emulated by all. The Wilkinson family is amazing.

Bowling,3dswq4,pegbiter,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"At my house, when there isn't specials going on, it's $3.75 during 'business hours' (M-F 9-5), and $4.75 all other times. I haven't rented shoes in years so I don't even know how much that is. It's kinda steep compared to other alleys in the area, and there isn't any specials for league bowler. I would go opening bowling so much more if they gave us league bowlers a break on prices."
Bowling,3dswq4,youre_byeongshin,2,Sun Jul 19 22:52:47 2015 UTC,I go in the off hours. I'm not in a league but I'm familiar enough that I'm pretty sure I get the league discount. 5.75 for 3 games.
Bowling,3dswq4,the7goonies,2,Sun Jul 19 23:26:27 2015 UTC,"Woah, bowling is so cheap for you guys. At my local alley, it's £7.50 ($11) for one game and £18.05 ($28) for three games. Shoe rentals are free, and there's no discount for (or even any concept of) league bowlers. They always have discounts on different days, and Tuesdays are half-price - but they have this fucking 'Cosmic Bowling' bullshit where they turn off the lights and have lasers and smoke and play music way too loud."
Bowling,3dswq4,SeekingMorrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:44 2015 UTC,yea @ night they got to much techno shit here too :< so if i want to bowl quietly i need to go early
Bowling,3dswq4,Flibblesh,2,Mon Jul 20 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"West Europe here. 25 euros per hour is the regular standard rate at pretty much every alley. Shoes are included. However, I only bowl at off peak times at the rate of 10 euros per hour."
Bowling,3dswq4,Necrumos,2,Mon Jul 20 12:31:47 2015 UTC,It's usually $2.50 to $3.00 per game here. There's a lot of specials where you can play unlimited number of games for 2 hours for only $10.
Bowling,3dswq4,lordlardass,2,Mon Jul 20 12:37:53 2015 UTC,For league bowlers @ my center it is $1.50/game.
Bowling,3dswq4,thealaskinwonder,2,Mon Jul 20 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"Ireland / Northern Ireland here.  My old center it was €4.50 a game, shoes free. New center, it's £4 a game, shoes free, or £2 a game if you're in the league."
Bowling,3dswq4,canbac,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:01 2015 UTC,"Here in Spain, there's a bolwing alley without oil and nothing, just for kids to throw balls and games are 1 euro, shoes rent for free, then there's a pro bowling alley where game are 3'50 euros from monday to friday and 5 euros during weekend, you can become member for 20 euros a get games for free, so it's cool, there isn't shoe rent and people must wear bowling shoes, so no bothering people playing, sorry for my english but... I'm spanish :/"
Bowling,3dswq4,Destroyer_101,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"My local alley has a special where from 9am - 5pm you can bowl as much as you want for $10.  Monday - Friday.  Usually, I'm not sure...games might be around 3.50?  With discount for league bowlers ($2.75?).  I'm not really sure what the normal price is, I really only bowl in my leagues in the evenings, and I'll bowl during the day if I get a new ball or something and want practice."
Bowling,3dswq4,redsox113,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:29 2015 UTC,We have a nice $10 for two hours in our area.
