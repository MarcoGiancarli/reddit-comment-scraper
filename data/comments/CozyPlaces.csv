The island was designed as a bastion and was originally windrose-shaped, hence the orientation of the buildings towards the middle. So the lay-out of the buildings kind of follows the symmetry of the old construction. The gaps between the outer islands were filled in later, giving it the rectangular shape.    I find your reaction very reasonable, everything rectangular should in fact be bombed... How dare they."

Been a while since I was taken aback by both wanderlust and a sense of, ""I could settle down there, no problem...""  I imagine finding a suitable and local job is a key factor."
CozyPlaces,3aqc7q,lennybird,3,Tue Jun 23 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly it is likely to be cheaper than living in London. If you were to work in London (admittedly where most of the jobs are - especially ones advertised to people from other countries) then being in the commuter area of London would still be more expensive. If your job was outside of London it wouldn't be too hard to live out in the country like this for a decent price. Sure that house visible would be around £2 million plus, but you could get a pretty decent smaller one (still with that nice peak district vibe) for around £300k, which would get you probably a small two-bedroom flat in London. Unless you lived in North Wales, North Scotland or Norfolk, the UK has good roads to get you to jobs some distance away quite quickly, so living in a place like this and commuting would not be a problem.  Where are you from?"
CozyPlaces,3aqc7q,Witherkay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thorough information! Seems like such a large difference in price between those two homes, but maybe the house visible in the image is bigger than I think.

CozyPlaces,3aqc7q,lennybird,2,Tue Jun 23 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"That's no problem! The type visible are often hotels/restaurants/pubs because no one can afford the upkeep as a house. I used to work at a restaurant in my village, and despite them making a fortune as a high-end place they could only afford to use the cellar and the bottom floor. I've heard tales of many Americans being disappointed by the size of UK houses, especially new builds and having been to America I agree. However, as a software engineer you'd have no trouble finding a job, and nurses are always in demand!"
CozyPlaces,3aqc7q,Witherkay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"Once again I appreciate your info. Yeah a big house isn't necessarily something we're after. I mean we want a modest sized family and room accordingly, but no need for anything excessive. For us it's more about the surrounding atmosphere, the people, and the privacy. I suppose another factor is how well these rural communities take to foreigners, whereas in London I imagine they're more accepting."

CozyPlaces,3aokg8,1YearWonder,3,Mon Jun 22 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"You're awesome, thank you :).  If you have any recommendations on monastic or gothic/medieval choirs/symphonies (violin, ambient, choir, etc), point them my way for that's also right up my alley! Things that come to mind are mostly soundtracks from games like:  The Halo series:   Halo 1 Main Menu Theme - Monastic choir into strong ritualistic drum beat, energetic violin leads, etc. Halo 2 Main Menu Theme - Fading in from the Halo 1's choir and into a higher octave female choir (beautiful). A more ""epic"" or grander feel at times with more pronounced refrains.    Medieval: Total War:  Main Menu - Really sets the mood. More monastic choirs with a transitive ""humming"" background ambiance and strong sudden attack.   Campaign Ambiance - One of 4 tracks that plays while on the campaign map. The most ambient, and I love it. The immersion factor of this game thanks to tracks like this is unreal.  Euro Mobilization - I can only presume this to be a mandolin, choirs, and traditional drums. Faster-paced and set the tone of the coming battle.   edit: Forgot one of my favorites: The Euro Ending Credits  The Elder Scrolls:   Morrowind Theme - I can't discern what's part nostalgia and association with a great game and just an impressive score, but I love this, not to mention the rest of the extensive soundtrack. Oblivion Song 1 - Tie between a couple for me in this game. Very cheerful overall. (Glory of Cyrodil, too) Oblivion Song 2 - More minor, nice piano lead."

CozyPlaces,3aqs58,Modzter,10,Mon Jun 22 19:23:23 2015 UTC,"Find a discount fabric store and buy 6 yards of the plainest, lightweight cloth - like an interfacing material, which is used in quilting. Get a ceiling hook and put it above the center of your bed and tie the cloth in the middle  and make a hoop so you can hang the cloth so it drapes down from the hook. Then you get some thumbtacks and pull/drape the cloth and tack it to the wall so the sides drape around the head of your bed. Basically you are building a tented bed canopy. If you're really clever, get one of those budget lamps that hangs on a cord and hang is so it runs down over the bed, between the two ends of cloth and add a 15 watt bulb and decorate the shade..instant lighted bed cove. On the super-cheap, check out any local dollar stores and see if they sell fake flowers and buy 20 bucks worth of so and you can hang them where you have pinned the drape to the wall and they make a wall garden as a headboard. Something like this"

You sink into a large, sturdy adirondack chair made decades ago by a craftsman, while a think blanket protects you from the cold as it did your grandmother. Feet enveloped in animal skin booties almost so comfortable you forget you're wearing them. The late fall winds separate the last of the leaves from their trees and circle around your head as the fire crackles nearby. And then you slowly fall asleep beneath the bright starry sky as the embers turn to ash in a slow upward dance to join them. Peace hushes the world to sleep with no sound except the occasional animal looking for it's mate. You sleep well."

Paris winters are chilly, but nothing like the mountains of Chile (I'm here all week folks!), so I suspect the windows that you saw fogging up were only single-pane glass. I'd wager that the windows at this chalet are actually triple-pane, which provides a lot of insulation."

Warm or muted colours also tend to make a space cozier, and the right kind of light is important. Try adding small lights instead of just having one big light in the ceiling. Also, nice pillows and, soft fabrics and comfortable materials make a big difference. For example, wood over plastic and cotton over non-natural fabrics. Many of these things can be found cheaply in flea markets and yard sales.  Put emphasis on the things that make you feel good."

CozyPlaces,35swc4,jmanley2,11,Wed May 13 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"Firstly, you have a lovely apartment :) and secondly, I've never commented on this sub before so if I'm wrong just ignore me.  You have some great warm accents with the brown sofa and rich wood, I would suggest a soft throw for the sofa (maybe a warm beige, or rich red if you feel brave), of maybe a knitted blanket. Perhaps a rug may help as it would break up the vast expanse of cool beige carpet. Also, personally, I like sofa cushions, not a ridiculous amount, but maybe 5-8 in complimentary colours.   Sorry if this is stupid advice, and I like your apartment how it is, this is just what I would do :)"
CozyPlaces,35swc4,JennaSidal,2,Wed May 13 07:49:15 2015 UTC,Love these ideas. What color/type of rug might you go with?
CozyPlaces,35swc4,JennaSidal,1 point,Wed May 13 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I like shaggy rugs because they're deep and warm.  I'd either go with a complimentary colour,  something warm and rich that draws from the room,  or your favourite colour.  Mine are teal, I love teal, maybe something rich like a hunter green or a warm,  dark orange..."
CozyPlaces,35swc4,KushBoy420,9,Wed May 13 19:13:47 2015 UTC,Walls! Go to a thrift store and get many things for the walls!
CozyPlaces,35swc4,frozenmargaritas,3,Wed May 13 11:59:34 2015 UTC,I think maybe some softer lighting options? I know fairy lights are not everyone's thing but you can get smaller ones and put them in coloured vases (like red or amber) to make something that's decorative and functional. But I find a bunch of soft lighting is cozier than one or two bright lights.
CozyPlaces,35swc4,the_new_leader,3,Wed May 13 12:06:19 2015 UTC,Christmas lights
CozyPlaces,35swc4,Handseamer,3,Wed May 13 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"Replace (or compliment) that lamp with a tabletop lamp that has a darker fabric shade. You should at least have the option of lighting that isn't stark.   Paint, if you can. White walls are the enemy of cozy.  Get some art on the walls. Get some candles on that coffee table. Get a blanket on that couch.   Finally, get some plants."
CozyPlaces,35swc4,nixiedust,2,Wed May 13 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"Love the idea of some fabric accents (pillows, throw) in a warm red or rust color. Lighting could make a big difference, too. Your overhead light is pretty warm, but try a pair of lamps on your side tables, low wattage. Add some pillar candles on the coffee table (battery operated is fine if you don't want open flame). Instant cozy."
CozyPlaces,35swc4,TheDivergentStars,2,Wed May 13 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have a white light bulb in the kitchen. Yellow light bulbs are much softer and cozier. You have some nice furniture but it's all quite neutral. I would suggest painting either the wall behind the TV or the wall with the door a warm colour, such as a deep red or warm yellow. Go to a hardware store and look at the paint selections and see what makes you feel cosy. The sofa to the side looks a little awkward to me, is it supposed to be part of the lounge or more of a separate reading area? Maybe push it closer towards to side table, push the tv stand into the corner and rotate the TV a bit. Or alternatively move it so it's a sofa for someone to sit on and chat to someone in the kitchen. I'm not sure, it just seems a bit lost at the moment. Some colourful cushions/a throw ir two could look nice and make the room feel softer. Not, that you have much but remove any clutter and find somewhere for it and get storage. You'd be surprised at how much at a difference it makes. Is that picture on the floor by the leather couch meant to be hung up. If so, do it! Pictures on the walls will make the place cosier and maybe go out and select a few bits that have warm colours in them again.   Overall you have a nice apartment, I've just been nit picking! Hope this helps though :)"

It's in a corner of the store, so there's not too many people walking through, and the ceiling is so low you pretty much have to chill on one of the sofas to exist in any way in the room.

But it's probably just an oil-burning furnace with a decorative face, in some places the furnace for the house commonly goes in the attic. It's certainly not a modern furnace, though.

Overall, I have to agree with /u/SwampFox2 a nice rug under the table and seat might be alright, depending on what your personal preferences are: everything neat and tidy or is a little bit out of balance also okay?

CozyPlaces,33uxwn,shadownukka99,3,Sun Apr 26 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"I do recommend you play it. Most people hate it, but that's pretty much just because it's such a massive departure from its predecessor. On it's own terms, it's a wonderful game.   This is gonna make no sense whatsoever, but I've always felt like the whole narrative is kinda ""cozy"" in a way. Unlike most RPGs, which take place over a short timeframe and a large area, it takes place over a long timeframe in just one area. The result is a real attachment to the setting and the feeling that your group of companions really are a group of friends. Whenever I play the game, I feel like I'm home - and it's ""cozy"", in its own weird way.  Like I said, no sense. But even though I think it's a great game, I love it for reasons beyond that - it always just makes me feel really happy, for whatever reason.   Sorry, haha, that was way off topic."
CozyPlaces,33uxwn,shadownukka99,2,Sun Apr 26 03:23:58 2015 UTC,"The reason I liked Witcher was because of its characters, the Polish-esque setting and Polish/Slavic mythology, but I will check out Dragon Age II. I just don't have the time for it right now."

CozyPlaces,33uxwn,GhostofZoomop,6,Sat Apr 25 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Some background info (small spoilers for Witcher 3, but this info has been established before release): Emperor Emhyr var Emreis is the emperor of Nilfgaard, the Roman Empire or Nazi Germany of the Witcher universe. Nilfgaard is infamous for taking over land and having a superior army. This palace appears to be in Vizima, which is the capital city of Temeria, taken over by Nilfgaard in the events of Witcher 3. Here is a map showing off the playable area of the game: http://i.imgur.com/Sna3kJe.jpg  As you can see, on the bottom right there is a guy next to Vizima with a banner of a sun. That guy is the emperor and I think that Vizima is the area where this screenshot is taken.  It is also possible for the area of the screenshot to be in Kaer Mohren, which is the top right of the map. To be honest, it would seem more realistic for an emperor of a large empire to have such a banquet rather than a small castle of warrior monks, which is Kaer Mohren, but to each his own.  The Witcher 3 is a dark-fantasy video game based on the book series entitled Witcher written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The game is going to be released on May 19th for PC, PS4 and Xbox One."

CozyPlaces,33liy1,bran_dong,4,Fri Apr 24 11:02:37 2015 UTC,"But since the house is mobile, how can it work once it moves?  Does it only move to campgrounds with water and seotic hookups?  Do campgrounds even have water and septic hookups?  I live in an apartment at the top of a skyscraper that never goes anywhere so I'm not sure how homes that move work."
CozyPlaces,33liy1,notreallyswiss,8,Sat Apr 25 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"Since it has been 10 days and no one answered you I will.  You can go to camp grounds and they often have different types of sites.  Some have just a piece of ground to throw up a tent.  Others have water only or have water and power.  Others have water, power, and septic for you to hook up to.  It all varies by place and you know this before getting there.    As for non camp site.  If you bought land and wanted to live in this you would need a few things.  You would need a water supply, that could come from the city or you could have a well drilled and have your own private water supply.  You need power... you can either have the power company run you a line (expensive) or you can do wind or solar power with a battery system (expensive).  Last you need septic.... you can either tap into the local sewer (not likely if you are living out on land)  or you can have a septic tank installed.  This will cost between 3K - 6K depending on where you are and some other factors.    If you were going to be living out on your land in this it would be suggested to pour a concrete pad for set it on instead of just parking on the dirt.    Let me know if you have any other questions."
CozyPlaces,33liy1,Curtis_Low,2,Wed May 6 14:37:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answering.  Though I do know about the ways to get water, septic, and power to a (non-mobile) private home, I wasn't sure about campgrounds.  Interesting to learn that some do have all the hook-ups.  I'm just confused about this particular place because it doesn't look like a camper (though I suppose it may be) and so I wasn't sure why  they put it on wheels since it wouldn't make sense to move it around on their own property."

Basically we don't know if the cover went on the inside or the outside of the poles, both this one and the tent in the picture went with the outside presumably because they decided it worked better for what they were doing.  More on the dimensions of the originals and acknowledgment of questions that don't have answers yet  More on the tents as well as other cool stuff found in the Oseberg ship  (I'm building one of these right now, or I would be if I could motivate myself to drag all the boards out of my car)  As far as the stuff on the inside of the tent goes, I don't know if they went with what was accurate or what was cozy.

CozyPlaces,2yxwze,lezarium,31,Fri Mar 13 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"Carefully.   It's not actually too difficult, there is about two inches of wiggle room total. So, push the mattress up against one corner and put the fitted sheet on the opposite one, repeat four times. Similar with the top sheet, just a bit more work to tuck in since you have to be on the bed to do it. Worth the extra work, though!"

If you were to build a similar bed in an actual closet you could shut out all the light and sleep forever...I guess that's not really a cozy place so much as a dungeon...

I definitely need to spend some time up there! Beautiful country. Even the drive through on the interstate was breathtaking. The national forests in Alabama are nice but don't have scenery like that... they also don't have a lot of cabin rentals, unfortunately. And much of the beauty of Bankhead NF can only be seen by several hours of hiking... which, I suppose, is a good thing, so it will not be spoiled.  Anyway, good suggestion on the Smokies.

CozyPlaces,2uzhux,tengallonterrarium,8,Fri Feb 6 18:41:03 2015 UTC,To take that one step further:   Paint the walls a darker color (Earth tones are nice).  move the bed closer to the window and drop a light weight fabric from around the sky light see here! add comfy pillows and a nice soft down comforter or soft throw like other posters have said. And I would totally add a bookshelf with a plant on top in the cubby hole.
CozyPlaces,2uzhux,tengallonterrarium,8,Fri Feb 6 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"My opinions, take them or don't.   Definitely, positively, absolutely concentrate on textiles. Choose bed coverings you want to sink into every time you walk in the room.  Lighting fixture choice will help a lot. I can't tell how this room is lit now except for those small spotlights.   Avoid any lamp that has the bulb exposed, either when you look down on it or up at it once you're in bed, like    this--except for task lighting at the desk-- or this. Instead go for something like this.   Edit to add, except Christmas lights. Christmas lights, like everyone else is suggesting, would be great.  Three You're killing me autocorrect. Big art in a small space is pretty cool. Your art seems too small and unrelated (I can't really see them well). They look like you're just trying to cover bare walls. You might consider one large piece to draw the eye or, if your stuff is related, put it all on the same wall in a sort of statement arrangement.   Maybe place the large piece on the wall with the monkey so everyone who looks in sees it. Ikea has very large stuff, but you can also go online. Don't pick something just to fill the space. I guarantee you people will assume you are in love with whatever the picture contains, because of the size. Based on the picture above the desk, I assume you might like a cityscape. Avoid the giant wall map if you're at IKEA. It's very 12 year old boy, at least in the States, where I am. So many parents have decorated kid's rooms with these.  Four. Reddit keeps autocorrecting to ""1"" It's a dorm room, so I don't think you can paint the walls, but if you can, then do it. White walls don't equal cozy to me. At the least paint the ceiling.  Good luck. Post when you're done, I'd love to see what you end up with."
CozyPlaces,2uzhux,greeklemoncake,5,Fri Feb 6 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"There is spotlights and a bedside lamp. The smaller stuff is from trips I've taken so there is some sentimental value, maybe I could move them closer together and put something else up, to cover try wall a bit better?"
CozyPlaces,2uzhux,tengallonterrarium,2,Fri Feb 6 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Then yes, I would definitely group them together, as they do represent a unified idea: travel.  Don't think every wall needs to be covered. If you have cool stuff going on, the eye will go to that. Right now, the eye goes all over the room. The room currently looks sparse and busy at the same time (no offense).   Analogy time, think music. Someone new to songwriting may think a song has to be 'interesting' from beginning to end, especially because a song typically lasts around three minutes. It's crammed full and ends up sounding more like clatter. Good songs, on the other hand, have rests built in, a slightly quiet spot or a repeated chorus.   If you put things on the wall just to avoid having an open space of wall, the eye sees clatter."

CozyPlaces,2u56ta,CraigEllsworth,8,Fri Jan 30 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"Warm, earthy colors; browns and such.  I always find that bright colors like white seem too cold, not cozy enough.  Low lighting, small sources of light, like desk lamps or candles, or a fireplace.  Or Christmas lights! Too much natural light through windows or too much bright lighting from ceiling lights tend to have the same problem to me as using bright paint colors.  Furniture should be cushiony, pillowy... blankety!  Do what you can to make the room feel smaller; big wide open spaces don't feel cozy.  Remove mirrors; half the point of mirrors on walls is to make the room seem larger than it is.  Put up posters or paintings with lots of earth tones and detail.  Make the environment busy or even a bit cluttered.  Books are great for that!  There's a restaurant near where I live called Cozy Nook... I should tell them how to redecorate B/"

CozyPlaces,2u2azr,fernguts,2,Thu Jan 29 13:45:54 2015 UTC,"A Room of One's Own:       A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf. First published on 24 October 1929,  the essay was based on a series of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College, two women's colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928. While this extended essay in fact employs a fictional narrator and narrative to explore women both as writers of and characters in fiction, the manuscript for the delivery of the series of lectures, titled ""Women and Fiction"", which was published in Forum March 1929,  and hence the essay, are considered non-fiction.  The essay is generally seen as a feminist text, and is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

No power in Tokyo, but you live in the 50th floor? Good luck and have fun with all those stairs you'll have to carry yourself and the groceries up.    These things apparently won't leave my mind too quickly, so I'll have to give up on my juvenile dream of ever living in such a place.    tl;dr: this is my definition of cozy and enjoyable, but there are many factors to consider that come into my mind."

CozyPlaces,2s7zfh,41234,1 point,Tue Jan 13 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"Ha, I only know realize, that I obviously subbed pretty much at the start as well. :D  It's such a perfect daily escape...   And why don't you build a cozy place? I would say it's possible nearly everywhere with little financial effort, if you're creative."

CozyPlaces,2s6ais,Webess,1 point,Mon Jan 12 20:05:07 2015 UTC,I'd just set up my rig at the kitchen table.

CozyPlaces,2s6ais,Webess,3,Tue Jan 13 02:14:34 2015 UTC,My thinking was: projector and screen. Except that would probably block off the kitchen. Hm...
CozyPlaces,2s6ais,blackadder1132,2,Tue Jan 13 14:06:48 2015 UTC,Not gonna be cooking and gaming at the same time! Problem solved.

CozyPlaces,2s6ais,exikon,2,Wed Jan 14 21:29:08 2015 UTC,They handled the bathroom well in this small house. Normally in houses this small the bathroom looks like a real hassle to use but that bathroom looks pretty comfortable. I think I would replace the couch cushions and the bed though because it looks like there isn't a comfortable place to sit down in the entire house
CozyPlaces,2s6ais,shleepwns,1 point,Mon Jan 12 18:39:48 2015 UTC,That's amazing. I'd take that in a second. Unfortunately $70k is bit too much for a student...
CozyPlaces,2s4spk,DocYoshi,7,Mon Jan 12 04:31:45 2015 UTC,Wow this is quite possibly the single nicest attic I've ever seen. I would love to hang out up there smoking weed or tripping.
CozyPlaces,2s4spk,chubbybearchaser,2,Mon Jan 12 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"cozy, but i wonder if it gets really warm and sticky in the summers"
CozyPlaces,2s2o5w,pinocchios_lover,3,Sun Jan 11 17:24:11 2015 UTC,I don't want to be negative but I've had a bit of a bad neck lately.  Half of the occupants of that corner sofa will find it slightly uncomfortable to watch that TV for long.  Maybe if it was a couple of people using the family room once the rest of the family have gone to bed.

CozyPlaces,2s1ke2,dddylannn,46,Sun Jan 11 07:24:05 2015 UTC,You're a broke college student living in an exposed brick apartment and modern fixtures... where exactly!?
CozyPlaces,2s1ke2,I_WANT_DA_CAKE,9,Sun Jan 11 11:48:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, Off campus housing for the University of Arizona, Tucson. There are a lot of older adobe houses and little bungalows through most of the neighborhood. This house was built around 1910s-1920s...    Terrible Landlord management company  the dishwasher never worked  we had a few wood floorboards in the living room that were cracking, completely broken through TERRIBLE insulation in the bedrooms - they tried fixing the ac/heater, but the house held none of it. Haha, there was a night in the summer it was cooler for me to sleep outside in my camping hammock, and in the winter below freezing... oh man... In my room sleeping in jackets, blankets, and with a sleepbag laid on top.   For student housing where people rotate in-and-out every year or so, it's pretty easy to put in a nice fixture and fix nothing else - I bet the new tenants are still waiting on that dishwasher though ;)  But obviously it was worth it, the kitchen, huge sun room (just through the french double doors in the 2nd picture) had 2 huge comfy couches that faced each other and a 5 piece stereo system and we would always just hangout in there. Such character in there...   EDIT: rent was like $350/mo + utilities. the couches and stereo systems were finds - amazing what people would throw away"
CozyPlaces,2s1ke2,themonkrat,3,Sun Jan 11 18:29:09 2015 UTC,I'll see if I can put together a bit of an album when I get home.

CozyPlaces,2s1ke2,I_WANT_DA_CAKE,14,Sun Jan 11 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL exposed brick is considered expensive in some areas.  Where I live it is considered to be cheap.  Then again, we build everything out of stone."
CozyPlaces,2s1ke2,Juggernauticall,15,Mon Jan 12 04:03:07 2015 UTC,Let's just say I live in the hipster capital of America and they actually charge more for exposed brick. It kinda depresses me just because I love it so much!

CozyPlaces,2rsxuo,darkdancingclown,28,Fri Jan 9 06:04:02 2015 UTC,You've almost recreated a kotatsu! It's basically a table with a blanket on top with a little heater underneath. I'm under one right now!

CozyPlaces,2rsxuo,Irishguy317,4,Fri Jan 9 02:02:16 2015 UTC,They are really fun! A kotatsu is as lower table with space for your legs only generally so I'd say yours is better! I'm only on holiday here so I'll miss it when I'm back home. If you Google it there are a lot of cozy and cute pictures.
CozyPlaces,2rsxuo,darkdancingclown,2,Fri Jan 9 02:11:37 2015 UTC,You have made me jealous.

CozyPlaces,2rsxuo,alcalde,8,Fri Jan 9 01:47:17 2015 UTC,So they're still a little dangerous?
