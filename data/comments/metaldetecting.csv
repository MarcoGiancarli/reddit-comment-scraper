I wouldn't go anywhere near the Ace. Personally a Tesoro Silver for $350 or even a Compadre for $220 is much better. Recovery speed is king and the Ace just sucks at it.    I am a local Tesoro/ Teknetics dealer but when my mum wanted  a detector I got her a 305. Great value and just enough features to be productive but not confused. I just waited for a 25% of special and picked one up for AU$319.    You can pay off any detector quickly if you learn it and the Ace will do the job,.

It could also be a draped bust, in 1797 they made experimental ""gripping"" around the edges. Also they were larger in the early years, find out the diameter and the weight and that would narrow it down considerably. Lastly, post a picture of the back, they were experimenting with multiple different reverses in the early years.   Edit: after figuring out the date, we can work on the variation/sub variation. These early large cents and half cents are my favorit. You get the joy of finding them, then get to spend time researching to find out what the hell it is! Some of those early years have 7+ variations and even more sub variations of the variations! It's like a second treasure hunt, finding that you have an obscure variation!"

If you aim for a detector under 100 USD, I doubt the discrimination capacity of it will be sufficient, which will probably lead you to digging up almost nothing but rusty nails and other junk. And if that's all you're finding, there's a good chance you'll be quitting this hobby real soon, which would be a shame...  Edit: In my opinion, you can get around without a pro-pointer. Delaying purchase of a pro-pointer until it is more affordable for your situation can add 100$ to your detector budget now."

metaldetecting,3df162,parsect,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should've said pinpointer (pro-pointer is a type of pinpointer). A handheld stick-like device that can locate your target more precisely within the heap of dirt you just dug up. You can find instruction videos on youtube. All the pro's use it, but I don't find it necessary. Once you've confirmed that the target is in your heap, get down and get your hands dirty (though look out for rusty nails etc, so wear gloves). Instructions in this video. It might not be the pro way, but I get the job done without a pinpointer just fine."

Let me preface my actual statement by saying that I love old Americana and historical artifacts.  I've watched an unhealthy amount of shows like Antiques Roadshow, American Pickers and even Pawn Stars.  I can't help it, I love knowing the history behind things.  It's why I detect and collect things.  What you have there looks like a late 1800s or early 1900s Navajo (or some other Native American tribe) style bracelet.  The thing about it is, it looks too purposefully made.  Like the markings on the side scream ""tourist"" piece.  They're too perfect and too Western Movie to be the right markings for this sort of thing.  But again, I'm just a stranger on the internet taking a guess.  The only reason I'm typing this is that as of yet you haven't gotten a good response.  Native Americans made tons of turquoise jewelry.  But the overall look of yours makes me think it could have been either made as a tourist trap style item.   Then again I could be wrong.   I would check the underside for any stamps.  I would assume early-mid 1800s Native Americans weren't stamping their siver jewelry and thus it could increase the odds of it being an older piece.  In any case I might start by emailing pictures (including ones of it's underside) to someone with some sort of information in Native American jewelry.  It's worth a shot."

metaldetecting,3cic57,computergeekguy,2,Wed Jul 8 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"It really depends. Most people will say bigger is better however that's not true 100% of the time. The bigger the coil, the more ground it sees. The more ground it sees, the more mineralization the detector has to process. This could cause you to reduce the sensitivity on the detector which is the ultimate loss of depth.   So usually if you're dealing with bad ground, smaller coils work better since they see less ground and you can operate at higher sensitivities.   Hope that helps!"
metaldetecting,3cic57,yamabiru,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:19:50 2015 UTC,"Hollandsbrook makes a great point. 7"" is actually pretty respectable and the bigger coil may bring less depth rather than more when attached to an entry level machine.

That location has been farmed ever since, so it makes sense that it could have taken some damage after 60+ tillings!"
metaldetecting,3bqtf6,abstractattack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:44:24 2015 UTC,Great video. Outstanding finds! What detector are you using?   How large of an area of land are you finding things? Meaning are your finds centralized? ...Stuff within a few hundred feet of each other or spread out and random?  This video puts the itch back in me. I have only been out a few (5) time this year. Thats down from the hundreds of times I was out in years past. I have a farm field I hunt for arrowheads in which I found colonial (and 1800-s) coinage visually. I need to get back there and put in a solid couple days work.
metaldetecting,3bqtf6,abstractattack,2,Wed Jul 1 16:37:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that! The positive feedback is really motivating me to start thinking more about upping my video game and starting a Youtube channel of my hunts!  I'm using a Fisher F2 with an 8"" coil, but seriously considering ordering the 11'' DD. I have ZERO complaints with the 8"", but hoping to nab some deeper hits in these really old locations. All of the items from this last hunt were found in an approx 75 square foot area (20-25 rows), fairly evenly spread out. Though, it's worth noting, because of the corn rows I'm fairly certain I hit every inch of it, slowly making my way down each!"
metaldetecting,3bqtf6,JeffersonDavis,2,Wed Jul 1 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Starting a channel is a great idea. I like that you sped up the digging and pinpointing. FYI. The coin and buttons may be safer clean by NOT rubbing rubbing the dirt off.  Add some of the info you mentioned to me and others here, so it give the view a perspective and context. I like videos that are informative and educating for those that share common detectors as OP.   (Rant) There are too many ""glorious find"" videos that only showcase someones once in a lifetime find. That is good and all, but, what if I have the same detector and I want to learned how to produce the same results? I would love to know the context of the hunt and indicators someones machine is giving as feedback.  Many of these money shot finds videos also have advertising income generated from views. I personally find it insulting. I/the viewer didn't learn anything. We just help generate revenue to someone that is showing themselves digging treasure (they will likely sell anyway). Bull...IMO."
metaldetecting,3bqtf6,abstractattack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"I would say it's insanely difficult to make a video that's not a piece of shit. To make a useful video you have to document everything: settings, signal the object gave before digging, signal after digging, orientation in the ground, measured depth and alignment in the ground, moisture, signal from different angles, etc. I've never seen a video like that before! I feel your pain though."
metaldetecting,3bqtf6,Kwindecent_exposure,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"The settings part is easy. You can add text at the beginning of a video to show how the detector is set. A go pro (or 2) set up to show the screen as one swings and hits signals.  Mount a go pro on your bicep or forearm, aiming at the screen."

I bought the Ace because it also came with some stuff like extra coil, duffel bag, scoop etc so...more bang for the buck. Easy machine to use. You'll need a pinpointer, you can get a garden tool at Lowes instead of a $30.00 Lesche digger."
metaldetecting,3bn4ww,KGBspy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:57:18 2015 UTC,What is the purpose of a pinpointer? What does it do?
metaldetecting,3bn4ww,redditforgotaboutme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:02:41 2015 UTC,Basically the detector you buy will give you a general idea of where your metal is. Finding that piece of metal can be extremely difficult once you start digging. The pinpointer will literally help you find it so you aren't digging forever. After my first hunt I went and got the garret because it just saves so much time finding stuff.
metaldetecting,3bn4ww,beano52,2,Tue Jun 30 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"With $500 to spend, you can get a very nice mid range detector with a pinpointer.  Since you are just getting into the hobby I would look for something with VDI.  VDI is an actual numerical target ID system rather that just a bar graph indicating a range (i.e. Garrett 250).  ANd positively get a QUALITY pinpointer (plan around $100 just for the pinpointer), trust me, you will want a quality pinpointer.  I really hate to make specific recomendations but I will say this much.  The difference between a ""cheap"" to ""midrange"" detector is huge but the difference between a ""midrange"" to ""high end"" is nominal.  A couple websites to look into once you think you have narrowed down your thoughts:  REVIEW SITE  Forum Site 1  Forum Site 2  It is a Great hobby and wish you the best of luck.  I have been detecting for nearly 20 years and sampled several detectors and brands.  pm me if I can assist any further!"

metaldetecting,3b77t6,JeffersonDavis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:19:49 2015 UTC,Beaches are very variable in conditions so it's unsurprising that what works somewhere wouldn't work elsewhere. There are dedicated beach detecting forums on several detecting forums so I would go there and start sorting through people's opinions on what works and what doesn't. That way you get a lot of different ideas on the best tool for the job.
metaldetecting,3b77t6,JeffersonDavis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"I understand that sure, but either a detector works in salt water or it breaks surely?

metaldetecting,3b77t6,RSRussia,2,Sat Jun 27 04:44:31 2015 UTC,"It could be they have their sensitivity turned way down to minimize the chatter that salt water would cause. That would likely mess with depth though, which would not be good at a beach since it's so easy to dig deeper holes."

metaldetecting,3apn2g,lo63054,3,Mon Jun 22 14:05:53 2015 UTC,Bought the F2 with the pinpointer. Love the Fisher F2 found some cool stuff so far (still consider myself a beginner). And it can go in the water (just not the electronic box at the top). Not sure about the Minelab but I would presume it would be ok to.  Pinpointer blows! It's better than nothing and I still have mine as a back up but I pretty much went out and ordered the Garrett Pro Pointer right away.  My 2 cents.
metaldetecting,3apn2g,dino_dog,3,Mon Jun 22 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"What /u/dino_dog says as far as the pinpointer.  If the inclusion is any part of the decision, forget about the pinpointer, it's barely even backup quality.  I'd suggest watching some youtube videos for the GO-FIND as they are really new and not alot of opinions have been formed.  The F2 is a fine machine for starting out and First Texas (Fisher, Teknetics, Bounty Hunter) is a stand up company.  I personally would recomend looking at the EuroTek Pro in the same price range/level.  Oh, you'll want to grab a better grade pinointer for sure.  The Garrett pp work fantastic.  I have a backup garrett and honestly would not hunt with out one."

metaldetecting,3amn0u,Taranathicus,5,Sun Jun 21 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"its a black powder cap and ball pistol.  I don't think its incredibly old, cap and ball like this wasn't around until the 1820's.  are there any markings on the barrel?  Also is the barrel bronze(looks un-corroded in picture) or rifled?  Just as a guess from the bolts and other parts I would think it likely less than 100 years old and probably less than 50 years old, probably some kid's ""treasure"".  But I am no expert by any means and if you get more info on it please reply as I am equal parts curious and jealous."

Two decetorists have found between 30 and 35 Arabic silver coins and parts of coins, at Møn (Area in Denmark)  It's the so far largest find of Arabic silver coins in the area. The coins -date back to 770-880 AD, which means it's from the early viking age.  The two treasure hunters from Mern and Nordfalster, got permission in the spring to search a farmers land on east-Møn.  The find was immediately reported to Southeast Denmarks Museum, and it is hailed as an important find by researcher Jens Ulriksen.  ""On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd rate this as very close to 10. It's the first find on Møn of any real coin hoard from the Arabic Califat""  The museum has done further searching in the area, and is now ready to send the find to the National Museum for value and finders fee assessment."

For those unaware, orienteering is a race using a compass and map (no electronic navigation allowed) to navigate a series of 10-30 control points in order in the fastest time possible. Course types can range from a college campus, to the middle of the deep woods,with different difficulty levels based on experience.   It's a lot more challenging and satisfying than Geocaching (in my opinion)"

metaldetecting,3a383y,Sgt_carbonero,3,Wed Jun 17 00:25:01 2015 UTC,I think olive oil is a better choice for copper and silver coins. I don't think the coins would handle electrolysis as well as big iron items does. I've heard that electrolyses can cause damage to coins and other small objects. Don't quote me on this though...I don't know enough about this subject to know for sure. Somone else in here will probably give you a better answer.
metaldetecting,3a383y,Tetradrachm,2,Wed Jun 17 00:36:42 2015 UTC,Very smart choice on the olive oil. Electrolysis is great for rust or some coin you don't really care about and want to risk it. It damages most coins.

metaldetecting,39k02e,OzRockabella,2,Fri Jun 12 07:03:00 2015 UTC,"Went down to the new council parkland to try my luck in the kiddies' playground. There are three separate play areas, and they all have about 20cm of fine bark chips comprising the underfoot surface. I've not been here previously so opted to detect under the zipline first. That proved to be a good move, and more or less straight away and consistently until I went home an hour or so later, I found coins! $8.25, but I won't count the 5 and 10 cent pieces I gave a little girl who was intently watching with her grandad.   When I got a signal, I asked her to see if she could find the target, which the Bounty Hunter said was on the surface. She dived in and found the shiny echidna (five cent piece for you non-Aussies) in seconds and her excitement was as joyful as always. A minute later, I had a very discoloured 10c which I said she could have too and when I left, she was excitedly telling her grandfather ""I like metal detecting!""   Another day, another few finds, more rubbish cleared from a community area and another mind switched on to the great hobby we all share. What more could one ask?"

metaldetecting,38vfbv,patniemeyer,2,Sun Jun 7 04:03:26 2015 UTC,"Better detectors use more advanced technology to discriminate and even a higher entry level detector would have a more finely tuned coil. Some guys use pointers, I never found them to be useful. I dig, put a scoop in a plastic bin and run it over with the detector. If it's in your bin start sifting, if not check the hole and keep digging. If you want a pointer I would look into a combo pack detector with wand. Garrett is known to offer that. Personally I'd save my money and get a nicer detector. Mine lab makes some inexpensive ones starting at 350. Others may laugh but I've had a lot of luck with bounty hunter. The key is to learn how to use your detector."

You will spend most of your time with the detector so that's where I'd invest most of your money. Harbor freight offers a pinpointer for about $15 that I'm a fan of.

I ordered a Fisher F2 (on the basis of this group's recommendation for an intro level detector) and it comes with a cheap pointer.  If it isn't a big improvement over my old one maybe I'll try the next step up.  BTW, some people asked for more details - I'm in Missouri, which has mostly clay soil covered in grass.  I'm not looking for anything in particular, just hunting.

metaldetecting,38vfbv,crankypants15,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know what features the RSD 3000 has but I went from a Bounty Hunter thingy to a Garret Ace 350. Here's what I like about the Ace 350.    Double D coil has a plane-shaped detection area, not inverted cone shape like the circular coils. This makes it easier to locate items by scanning in an ""X"" pattern.  Notch discrimination so I can ignore all iron.  Pin point mode. I use that to start, then get out my ProPointer. Honestly, I had the BH metal detector with my ProPointer, and the PP helps a lot. The PP doubles my finds.  The 350 came in a package deal (from Kellyco I think) with a cheap pin pointer which had a range of 1/2"", which makes it useless to me. The Garrent PP has a range of 4 inches at least.  Coil is waterproof.    Cons of 350:    Super deep depth based on mass of  object. The more mass a metal object has, the deeper the MD will find it.  If there are metal drain pipes in the area 24"" down, it will find them."
metaldetecting,38vfbv,iceman0c,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:33:06 2015 UTC,"So I got the F2 today, set it up, read the manual, tested with some coins in air, etc. and it seems ok.   However I'm a bit frustrated with in actually trying it out in my backyard as all I get is noise / random signals.   I started with the 10"" coil and tried reducing the sensitivity.. then went to the 8"" coil and reduced sensitivity...  Maybe I just have super trashy soil and need to go way down?  I think I found one spot that was reasonably reproducible, dug for it and after 15 min couldn't find anything... the signal just sort of disappeared (even after searching the debris that I carefully pulled out of the hole).  I'll try a new location tomorrow...  or maybe the even smaller (4""?) coil?  Or is it possible that I just have a bad unit?"
metaldetecting,38vfbv,iceman0c,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"Could be the mineral level of the soil, trash in the soil, electrical interference, etc. The f2 does not have manual ground balancing so you could see if it behaves better in a different location. Try using the discrimination feature to get rid of the iron and lower the sensitivity"
metaldetecting,38vfbv,crankypants15,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:00:09 2015 UTC,Setting the discrimination to iron did eliminate 90% of the noise... I found a couple of very reproducible signals and dug for them but didn't end up finding anything...  One appeared to be deeper than I wanted to dig and the other just sort of disappeared as I kept subdividing the earth to find it.  Anyway - I'll keep trying until I find something.

metaldetecting,382fzr,Cahallfresh,3,Mon Jun 1 12:08:50 2015 UTC,Roughly 5 ounces in western australia. I would add some photos but i'm not really sure how. Me and my little brother spent nearly 3 months on the gold fields and found a 5.6ounce specimen that had just over 2 ounces of gold and a patch that ended up producing over 150 small nuggets for nearly 3 ounces of gold. It was a pretty awesome experience.
metaldetecting,382fzr,Cahallfresh,3,Mon Jun 1 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds amazing. I'm don't know anything about your detector, so I'm sorry! I had no idea you could find gold in that much quantity."
metaldetecting,382fzr,SaintAnthonysFire,3,Mon Jun 1 21:51:48 2015 UTC,We found barley anything compaired to what other people have found. We met a dude who found a 2.2kg gold nugget. Our 5.6ounce was found at 90cms deep. It was awesome except the 4hr dig lol. It's an amazing hobby. Cost a fair bit to start up but it's worth it.
metaldetecting,382fzr,Cliintoris,2,Mon Jun 1 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"How is its discrimination?

metaldetecting,382fzr,SaintAnthonysFire,2,Mon Jun 1 12:22:07 2015 UTC,"The discrimination isn't very good, especially for beach hunting.

metaldetecting,382fzr,ryanchappell,2,Mon Jun 1 19:58:58 2015 UTC,You have it right. The monoloop coils don't discriminate but with a DD coil has the option but i've never used one. I've just always dug every target. Even the slightest murmur in the threshold i did. I've found a .01gram nugget that bearly set off the detector while it was touching the coil.
metaldetecting,380d83,colliepop,6,Sun May 31 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"Get the metal detector. See how it responds when you pass it over a similar object to your Mum's engagement ring because different detectors have different responses to different finds (ie they make different sounds and/or screen responses depending on what is detected). Divide your garden into manageable squares so you can search systematically. That should help. Before you do all that though, get your mum to check her pockets! Oh, and rings tend to fall off when hands get cold so I'd start looking anywhere she may have washed her hands etc.  Good luck."

metaldetecting,380d83,dirtymoney,2,Sun May 31 23:49:49 2015 UTC,"remember... pick a test gold ring that is basically the same shape of the engagement ring as different gold rings will ring up differently on a metal detector.

metaldetecting,380d83,Tubs_McGuinty,2,Mon Jun 1 22:07:18 2015 UTC,"break the lawn down into small squares, like an archaeological hunt. The ring won't be deep, so if you get a detector with a depth indicator, you can ignore the deeper stuff. The deepest I could see it being is around an inch, if someone inadvertently stepped on it. Other than that it should just be on the surface."
metaldetecting,380d83,ImpalaPooge,2,Sun May 31 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"The detector is going to measure depth by distance from the detector correct?   If you are waving it at the tips of the grass blades, a fresh cut, healthy lawn should be about 3-3.5"" tall, depending on your mower heigh settings"

Swear to God, so many folks called out to find rings with their machine, look for hours, and then think to check in the garden gloves. Look there first.  Also, dig every signal. 14K and 18K gold can ring up as foil, and the fact there's a gaping hole in the middle of the target when scanning for a ring can give you a goofy response."

YAY!!  Using my Whites IDX Pro, I visited a large neighborhood pond/park that I quickly realized had never been metal detected before.  In about  3 hours of muddy hunting there, I found $5.10 in clad, 2 good usable lead fishing sinkers, and a myriad of pull tab trash etc.  Then yesterday i revisited the sand volleyball pits at my church I hunted over Spring Break.  It was here that I found my 2 ""firsts"".  I started out running the side closest to the parking lot where everyone puts their shoes etc.  I distinctly remember a strange quarter signal that I dug last time (a soft beep/ping instead of a solid beep) that I dug last time and after a deep dig I gave up assuming it was a deep trash target.  his time, I decided to dig the hole again as I was curious and tipped by a friend who found a silver quarter that deeper silver items sometimes don't give a normal solid beep signal.  I guess I was just slightly off on my hole the previous time as this time I was rewarded with my first silver.  It turned up to be an immaculate James Avery sterling silver ring about 4 inches down.  I couldn't believe my luck.  Then as I hunted on, I dug m last signal of the day (rang up like another quarter) and realized it was a bicentennial quarter.  As we all have, I've found plenty of them in pocket change, but I have never found one metal detecting before.  My combined clad from the two locations comes out to $9.63. The Lover's Knot Ring is listed on the  James Avery website at $60, but by weight (0.20 ounces) comes out to be $3.35!!!    I have a bunch of silver coins I bought many years ago when the price of silver was down in hopes that one day when I am older, I can pass them on to my family or sell them for a tidy profit.  With the silver jewelry and coins that you guys find, what do yall do with them? Save them and sell them to a Gold and Silver store at the end of each year, sell them as used on eBay, etc. or just save them as a neat find?  I have no clue what to do with mine."

Those things can go like 6 feet deep. The problem is that they won't discriminate, but for finding ferrous items like you'll be looking for, that won't matter. You will have to dig everything that it detects too, which could take years on 7 acres. If you get a treasure hunting detector, it may not go deep enough, and you'll still have to dig everything it detects."

My Garrett Ace 350 finds coin-sized objects down to at least 12 inches, and if the object is bigger, even deeper. I found my old cast iron sewer line and it has to be at least 3 ft deep.

metaldetecting,378qfq,YEE_YEE_2015,1 point,Tue May 26 00:38:12 2015 UTC,It's a ballpark that has some history.  I do the same types of places as you.  I got lucky with the first gold bracelet because it was in the same hole as a silver necklace.  The second bracelet I eyeballed.  I dig a lot of pull tabs and I dig all the 12-13 signals for nickels....hoping for gold rings.  I'm using an e-trac.

metaldetecting,375d6g,BishopofBling,1 point,Mon May 25 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about getting that pinpointer, is it okay?"
metaldetecting,375d6g,LordMason122,3,Mon May 25 02:56:21 2015 UTC,It would detect a pennies and dimes to a bit over 1.5inch and .50 cent and bottle caps at about 2 inches.  It was loud enough to hear even with headphones but you have to hold the red button on to use and I had to adjust the sensitivity a number of times as I used it.  I think its well worth the price(with the 20% off coupon) and I won't cry if it breaks.
metaldetecting,375d6g,LordMason122,1 point,Mon May 25 03:08:16 2015 UTC,It seems pretty good for 14 bucks. Thanks for the info
metaldetecting,375d6g,iceman0c,2,Mon May 25 03:19:18 2015 UTC,I used that pinpointer for a long time before getting the Garrett propointer. It is a totally usable pinpointer that I recommend to anybody looking for a budget alternative. I firmly believe that a pinpointer is needed in this hobby and $14 is a much easier pill to swallow than $100+
metaldetecting,375d6g,Raff001,1 point,Mon May 25 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's pretty common for the push button to wear out. I replaced mine with a toggle switch and it works great, plus you don't have to hold the button anymore to keep it on, which is nice."
metaldetecting,375d6g,Raff001,1 point,Wed May 27 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"I like mine, it's pretty easy to use once you figure out how it works, the manual was not great at explaining it, but once I watched a few youtubes on people using that model and going out and digging myself it wasn't too bad. It's really about listening to (and learning) the tones. I typically run in disc mode with the disc set just before 12 o'clock on the dial, that filters out a lot of the garbage, but you can still hear aluminum a bit, so depending on where I am I can decide if I want to dig it or not. For the price, I think its a great detector.  It'll give a person a great feel for detecting and not break the bank.  Then it makes for a great back-up or loaner for when a person is ready for a better machine."

metaldetecting,374eok,dirtymoney,2,Sun May 24 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, not sure - I quit messing with it pretty quickly once I realized it was a wire run."
metaldetecting,374eok,dirtymoney,4,Sun May 24 20:23:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I assume you touched it with metal and didnt die from an electric shock since you saw the color of the metal.   It could very well be a short run of wire long forgotten.   I've run into those before  Did you see how far it went with your metal detector? If I run into wire I will see how far it goes and if it goes a long way and is insulated I wont mess with it.  Btw... 2 inches deep is ridiculously shallow for a wire run. Could be it was just left on top of the ground and got buried over time by ground clutter/leaves."
metaldetecting,371vhh,SaintAnthonysFire,2,Sun May 24 02:13:39 2015 UTC,I've been trying for one of these for damn near two years. I finally pulled one out today. A bit corroded but still has some decent detail. Them damn flying turds really didn't hold up well! Can't believe how thick it is! I think it's either a small date 1858 or possibly a 8 over 7. I don't wanna even touch it(flaking very easy) so I'll probably never know!

metaldetecting,371vhh,Codeworks,2,Sun May 24 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"Lol. It's a flying eagle cent. They were only circulated in 1857 and 1858. There were 1000 minted in 1856 and given to legislators and collectors I believe. I think it's one of the uglies coins ever minted, and when they get worn down they look like a turd with wings. At least that's what I think lol. http://coinsforsale.mountainviewcoins.com/cents-indian-head-cents-1857-flying-eagle-cent-g4-r-1080.html Here's a good example of a flying turd/turd with wings."

metaldetecting,371qp6,The-Ride-Never-Ends,3,Sun May 24 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"I would try a little bit better model. Also check Pawn Shops! Great detectors at good prices there! I have this bounty hunter model, if you can afford a few bucks more, You are gonna get much much more detector, Including ground balancing, and a much better screen/features, like pinpointing, which is a must for me.  Check out these 2 bounty hunters I have this 3300 and love it, but if you cant afford it, there is also the 2200  Bounty Hunter 3300   Bounty Hunter 2200  Also, if you get a chance, Look on Craigslist! I have a saved search so that any time someone lists ones, It send me an email. ou can get great deals there too.   One last thing, Is Check out the Garrett Models 150 and 250. Obviously the 250 is going to be better model and more features, its just about what you can afford.  If you do get a decent one, Stay hard at it. Its easy to give up, Its easy to say its not worth it, but in the run, its great excersize, and not to mention, Its the only hobby that pays you to do it. Remember that. Just keep at it, and you will better and so will your finds! Good luck and happy hunting! Dont forget, pawnshops and craigslist!"

metaldetecting,371bej,crankypants15,1 point,Sun May 24 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"I have the Ace 350. The 250 is with the circular coil, not the double-D coil, right? With the circular coils they have an inverted cone shaped detection area, so the closer your coil is to the object, the wider the field is, and the harder it is to pinpoint it. Lift up your coil 6-7 inches from the ground to help with pinpointing.  Then you'll be using the tip of the detection field."

metaldetecting,36x1h4,shiasupprize,3,Fri May 22 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"I started with this hobby last summer myself, so I can give a quick recap of my own recent experiences as a total noob.   http://imgur.com/a/jANGM   First I looked at the Fisher F2, but quickly decided on the F4 instead because it had a couple of features I wanted (i.e. manual ground balancing).  I got a rain cover for the control box as I was sure water, sand, and mud would not agree with the electronics over the long run. This is essential for the Fisher F series, because they are not weather proofed (the control knob is not sealed).  I also got a Lesche Knife (red handle makes it easier to see, so you won't leave it behind!) and a small Black Ada BigFoot shovel. I hardly ever use the shovel tbh, and I rarely bring it with me, so the Lesche does all the digging for me just fine. I also have a plastic Fiskars gardening shovel for digging in beach sand, which allows me to use the pinpointer at the same time.  After spending a couple of weeks getting increasingly more and more frustrated (to the point I almost gave up) from digging endless series of holes without ever finding the stuff the detector has detected, I decided to get a Garrett Pro Pointer. And suddenly I started enjoying this hobby. A lot. So yeah, get a pinpointer.  When it comes to headphones, I deiced to not go for the big heavy over-the ear (closed) types. It gets really hot here in summer time, and I'd hate to wear something that makes my ears fill up with sweat after 2 minutes. So I got a really inexpensive neckband headset (i just disconnected the removable microphone). The Fisher F4 only gives really loud beeps in different tones, so to be honest... I hardly ever use the headset unless I'm in a noisy location or if I feel like I'm disturbing people around me.  The beaches here where I live have incredibly amounts of junk (aluminum, soda cans, tabs, candy wrapping, etc) from summer time swimmers and sun bathers, so I tend to stick to the grassy areas where people walk to and from the area."
metaldetecting,36x1h4,demux4555,3,Fri May 22 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"You can get a $100 detector that will work just fine for finding things. What will really make the hobby enjoyable would be the Garrett Pro Pointer, as has been said. Nothing's worse than spending 5 minutes sifting through clumps of dirt only to come up with a wad of aluminum foil. The Pro Pointer will get you moving to the next find in one minute."
metaldetecting,36x1h4,OneManNinjaClan,0,Sat May 23 12:27:09 2015 UTC,"I dunno, 2 years without a pinpointer here, it takes a few minutes to find something. My buddy is on 4 years no pp, amazing finds has he."

metaldetecting,36x1h4,Ne007,2,Sat May 23 12:37:55 2015 UTC,"A plastic sand scoop is immensely valuable when beach detecting. They are about $10 and will help you find your target in seconds, wet or dry sand (as long as it's not sodden stuff right on the waterline, but even then it will work if you dunk it in the water while you swish).  A common old screwdriver for grass finds, hat, sunscreen, water, ear buds (listening through these or headphones saves a lot of battery power AND it stops people crowding around you because they can't hear the detector's tones), a fanny pack for your finds and a bag to take away the garbage.  :)"

It didn't go long before the beeper went crazy, the axes are all between 25-30 cm in length. This is the largest such find in Europe(that they are all together in one spot)  Since the find, archaeologists have been searching the area more thoroughly and found 9 more axes and a spear. There's going to be done more digging in the area by museum folks.  Landovner realises that he probably isn't going to be able to plant christmas trees straight away, but it's ok as the museum folks are nice and friendly and it is exciting to follow their work."

metaldetecting,36363t,tjmjnj,1 point,Fri May 15 23:29:35 2015 UTC,After reading the article I would guess that this find was at the location of a bronze-age forge. The other axes were found broken into 4 pcs. Probably because they were worn and would soon be melted down to create a new axe head. I bet if they dig the area out more they'll find evidence of that forge.

A word of caution with regards to water detecting with the AT Pro. A wise and learned man told me to watch the battery holder latch to make sure it didn't get bumped while underwater. Evidently that can cause the control box to fill with water and ruin the detector. Best of luck to you AT Pro users. I haven't went underwater yet but have some good locations to start.
metaldetecting,35u91v,IS_JOKE_COMRADE,3,Wed May 13 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"Usually the top end detectors weigh a bit more. So that probably won't work.  The detector itself doesn't really do a good job at determining what's in the ground. What they do extremely well, is give you the required information to make an informed guess on what's in the ground. This is why the better detectors have a pretty steep learning curve. All the information in the world isn't going to tell you anything unless you know how to decipher it.   Lastly, depending on the metal you are searching for, the detector can vary greatly on how well it can discern between a good target and junk. Gold is very tricky to pinpoint without digging aluminum targets as well. Silver on the other hand can be told apart from other targets pretty easily."

My point is that a human being will do this inherently less efficient than a computer that has thousands upon thousands of data points to draw from
metaldetecting,35u91v,OneManNinjaClan,2,Wed May 13 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think something like that could work considering the weight of detector/search coil and how close to the ground it would have to fly.  I have seen a kids R/C car that incorporated a very crude detector.  https://www.fatbraintoys.com/toy_companies/elenco_electronics_inc/edu_toys_ranger_r_c_metal_detector.cfm I think that concept could be improved but would still be lucky to find anything more than a few inches deep, would miss any target it didn't drive directly over and would have no discrimination."
metaldetecting,35u91v,Crack_is_whack140,2,Wed May 13 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"You're talking about discrimination, which, even cheap detectors are capable of. It's easy to rule out the junk/ferrous metal. It's also easy to get vastly different readings between a gold object and a silver object. However, even the best detectors cannot tell you the difference between a pull tab and a gold ring. Some junk items will always register along with the good items."

metaldetecting,35u91v,raudssus,2,Wed May 13 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"This is all theoretically possible, but you'll need an electrical engineer to work it out. Pulse induction/modulation is the most promising tech for good depth and area detection. There is an inverse relationship between sensitivity and discrimination accuracy. A detector could absolutely be mounted on a multicopter for flights up to thirty minutes, modern ones can carry more than five pounds."
metaldetecting,35u91v,Cliintoris,2,Thu May 14 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea and it's good to see outsiders thinking about where metal detecting technology could go, but if you're really trying to work on advancing it and building a new machine, you should definitely take the time to do some research about the current technology to get a better understanding of how your idea would work.  Right now, the traditional metal detector required a person to swing it slowly back and forth right over the ground, and it will make a sound, show a picture, or give a number that conveys to the user what the target may be.  A number can be anything; there's absolutely no way to be 100% sure what something is before you dig it up.  It's not a matter of human error, it's just how far detecting technology has come.  In order for your idea to become a reality in the way you described, you would first have to design a detector that is lightweight, has a very fast recovery speed (target identification speed, basically), and very very good discrimination (being able to tell items apart).  With today's discrimination abilities, even in the best detectors out there, it's simply impossible to do that.    I just wanted to give a thorough answer without making any accusations or insults because I really do like the idea.  That being said, the first step is to educate yourself! Good luck"

It is doable, just not easy. When one day the people stop investing in 200 EUR metal detectors, then the high end detector market might grow to give this device.

A detector detects when it moves over that object from a relatively short distance away.  You have to go slowly, and wave it back and forth.  Unless you had a defector that didn't need to be swung fairly slowly and repeatedly, you wouldn't be able to cover any more ground by attaching it to a drone"
metaldetecting,35tsnx,benicetogroupies,9,Wed May 13 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"Couple questions:    1.) Do you have a brand you were looking at?    2.) Do you already have any other equipment?    3.) what is your experience level? first timer? used a detector 5-10 times?    You 100% need a pinpointer dispite what some might say. Easiest to use is a garret propointer (around 100$ new). After that a digging tool can be got for 20-40$ online from various places. So your actual budget is netween 350-400$. That is a great range to start from, i would suggest a used garret at pro or a used whites machine. otherwise a new euro tek pro, ace 350, or fischer f5. All great mid range machines but as an ATPro owner i cant suggest any machine more. Also i would stay away from amazon, usually their prices are higher than what you can get from a vendor over  the phone. The way pricing works is vendors can only advertise down to a certain price but they can accept offers over the phone for much less, sometimes VERY near their cost price. Always call a few vendors (bigboyhobbies, kellyco, etc)"

metaldetecting,35tsnx,LeftyHyzer,3,Wed May 13 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Usually vendors are very understanding about shipping costs, especially if you call them! My other BIG suggestion is to join the forum over at metaldetectingforum.com. Very mature and helpful crowd over there and there are even 10-15 vendors that are on the site that can offer you a good deal. Do make sure to get a quality pinpointer AND a detector with pinpoint mode. They will help you ALOT in learning to retrieve targets. Also youtube videos shot from a POV are a bit harder to watch than the ""tv show angle"" ones but they really help to see what the detectorist sees, so make sure to watch both kinds."

The at-pro is my suggestion if you only ever want to buy 1 detector, usually around 400-450 lightly used, or 500-600 new.

Which is why I try to move it at the same speed, always. Often times moving to one side the object beeps as silver, then moving the other way it beeps as iron. Through experience I know this is not silver.   Also, have you changed your batteries lately?   Take it to an MD store where they only sell MDs, see if they can help you out or at least narrow down the problem, but change your batteries first. Then set the detector on a table outside, well away from metal objects. Now put in your hand a penny or another metal object and wave your hand in front of the coil. What happens?   You can also get inconsistent signals if a coin's edge is facing the detector.   Also remember these machines are pretty sensitive. The more mass an object has, the deeper the MD can find it. I routinely find smashed metal cans at 10-12 inches deep even with the 350 at a low sensitivity. Same thing with 1-3lb chunks of iron (probably old car parts). If I don't find a coin at 10 inches I usually give up, meaning it's likely something large and non-coinish registering as a coin."

We have no other hobbies except walking really so we are very interested. We were thinking of spending around £200 - £300 but we are so unsure.

When I got started I read them non-stop and got a decent feel for what detectors people were using. A lot of them will have reviews of detectors too...some of which may be helpful.  To recommend a specific brand, I know some of the UK detectorists I've seen on the forums really like XP detectors. Crusader on the Treasurenet forum used an XP Goldmaxx Power for years and made wonderful finds, and just googling around I've seen used ones for 400-500 pounds. That's a little higher maybe than what you mentioned, but if you are patient you can generally find good deals."

It has several discrimination modes to ignore junk, just find coins, and a custom discrimination mode you can set the discrimination for.  It also has a depth ""guesser"" but the depth is ""if this is the mass of a coin, this is the depth"" kind of thing. So an object that reads at 6"", if it's massive, it will actually be much deeper. It was about $350 new I believe, see if you can find a used one.  It also has a pin pointer mode but I still use my Garret Pinpointer pro. The Ace 350 pinpointer just tells me where to start digging.  It comes with the double D coil, which is one step better than the circular coils.  Very sensitive though. It baffled me  many times on shards of wire or rusty paperclips.  That's when I started ignoring iron."

metaldetecting,34vpa3,IllMakeAStory,5,Mon May 4 23:14:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know your metal detector, but here are two things to do to learn how to use it:  Put various sized metal objects on the floor, of different sizes and metals. Use a quarter, dime, paper clip, copper penny (pre-1982), small piece of aluminum foil, and a steel screw. Then experiment with trying to detect them at different heights. Then throw a blanket over it and see how well you can find them and pin point their location. This allows you to gain experience in the comfort of your living room.  When you go out in the field, have something metal along to use as a test target, to make sure you have your settings correct. Sometimes there is nothing to detect and you get the feeling that your detector is not working, so a metal test object gives you reassurance that it is working properly."
metaldetecting,34vpa3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Mon May 4 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"good advice, except I would add... testing outdoors away from power lines/cables, in a spot that you've determined to be metal free (check using pin point/all metal mode).  Also air testing, is never an exact replication. Detectors react differently to buried targets. Still, it is a good way to get a basic understanding of your machine."
metaldetecting,34vpa3,analchasm,1 point,Tue May 5 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"The reason I bring that up is because I find people at the beach unboxing a metal detector and I watch them attempting to read the manual and figure it out in the field. They are normally frustrated, when they could have started their first basic lesson being frustrated in the comfort of their own home. =-}  I also find people walking down the beach detecting, and I can tell they are new at it. I throw a quarter in front of them and they can't detect it. Then they act puzzled. They had just walked two miles with the sensitivity cranked too low.   I've owned three detectors in the past 45 years. I built my first one myself back in the 1960's using those new devices called ""transistors"". =-} It mostly worked, but was very finicky."

metaldetecting,34vpa3,lilboomboom,1 point,Thu May 7 13:10:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the kits (if there still are any out there) are likely to be the electrically simpler designs. Basically an oscillator and monitor the frequency shift caused by change in the inductance of the search coil. The pulse method usually requires an embedded processor and numerical processing of the signal, so not many people would give a design like that away. You might find somebody over at Dangerous Prototypes dot com or at HackaDay dot com with some preliminary designs that they can share.  I haven't searched."
metaldetecting,34vpa3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu May 7 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I've seen the dinky Hackaday DIY detector, but will absolutely look into the DangerousPrototype designs. A microprocessor is not out of my scope. I'll post to this sub with progress on the build."
metaldetecting,34vpa3,lilboomboom,1 point,Thu May 7 14:18:36 2015 UTC,Maybe you could contribute to the design of an open project. Good luck.
metaldetecting,34vpa3,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu May 7 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"1) that is definitely enough depth to find really cool things.   2) a false signal is a signal that goes off when there is highly mineralized soil and not an actual target below or signals from cell phone towers, routers, cell phones causing your detector to go off. You can tell a false if it is inconsistent with where you point your detector. A real target will go off exactly where you swing the detector over and not randomly.  3) you want to use the highest sensitivity as possible, this is the depth, higher sensitivity the deeper your detector can detect, although only turn it up as high as you can, some soils will be too mineralized and cause falsing, once the falsing occurs turn the sens down until they stop and that is the max sens you can detect in that area"
metaldetecting,34vpa3,Bri7man,2,Tue May 5 02:11:57 2015 UTC,It will find targets but there is a learning curve to using any detector and without a built in pinpointer or handheld one you will start out doing a lot of searching/digging.  Stick with shallow targets and lower sensitivity first. About false signals even on a good day I get about 2 bottle caps or pull tabs for every coin I dig up(big public park near me with picnic tables).
metaldetecting,34vpa3,BishopofBling,1 point,Tue May 5 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"bottle caps and pull tabs are not ""False"" signals! Falsing is when a signal is given when no actual target is under the coil as Bri7man describes in #2 above"
metaldetecting,34vpa3,analchasm,2,Tue May 5 15:30:27 2015 UTC,Sorry I meant false as the detector reads the target as much higher than it is.  I get pull tabs that are bent over themselves and very rusty bottle caps reading as high as quarters.
metaldetecting,34vpa3,BishopofBling,1 point,Tue May 5 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"Right now I have an $8 detector I found at a yard sale. It is from the 1970's. =-} It works well enough for the meager things I do.  Beginners shouldn't immediately dismiss their low end detectors as junk until they get some experience and learn the basic tricks. A highly expensive and sophisticated detector in the hands of a novice operator is still going to seem like junk, until they get a 100 hours of learning how to detect things."
metaldetecting,34ubwg,ggliddy357,4,Mon May 4 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"AT Pro on the beach here.  Some things I've learned:  For a saltwater beach, it's important to adjust your device for the higher salinity in the ground.  I tend to use Pro coin mode, you get a better indication of junk. This allows you to try and discriminate things like a bottle tab out. (Instructions found in the video's linked below)  If you haven't yet, go through all four of the AT PRO training videos from Garrett website.  I learned a lot about my AT from those.  -HTH"
metaldetecting,34ubwg,aar0nm,1 point,Mon May 4 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say try to get used to pro mode as well. Also make sure to ground balance, especially when moving from dry sand to wetter sand and back. For me, bottle caps ring out very similarly to coins but pro mode helps distinguish. Whenever I find a signal I want to dig, I go over it again with iron audio off. Bottle caps tend to have an iron sound at the ""edge"" of the good tone if that makes sense. Also about the jewelry, the beaches near me dredge the sand clean every day. This means unless I'm in the water, the only jewelry I can find is from that day so it's a little tricky. Don't give up!"
metaldetecting,34ubwg,iceman0c,1 point,Mon May 4 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"Don't get discouraged. It takes a while to learn the machine. I agree that you should use Pro coin mode. Learn the tones by digging up everything for a while. You will soon learn that even different types of bottle caps all have distinct readings. If you're looking for gold, then really make sure you're digging the pull tabs.  and aluminium signals.  happy hunting!"

Whenever i find silver coins i am able to just wipe the majority of the dirt off with my finger.  If you want to clean your clad and spend it you could purchase a tumbler and use that to clean it.

Magnets do not have an effect on it (non-ferrous). When I filed a corner I found it was silver coloured. It showed up as 87 on a Garrett metal detector. I could also scratch little bits of the metal off with a small wood chisel. I am currently soaking it in diluted vinegar to remove the buildup it.

Only upgrade you may want are nicer than stock headphones (the stock ones arent waterproof submersible) and the 5""x 8"" coil. Other than that it comes 100% ready to find targets your f2 may just cruise over. Some deep signals that my AT pro finds dont even give off a beep at full sensitivity with my ace 250."
metaldetecting,33chrv,LeftyHyzer,2,Tue Apr 21 14:46:41 2015 UTC,Would you reccomend the AT Pro over something like the Whites MXT?
metaldetecting,33chrv,menagese,5,Tue Apr 21 17:03:10 2015 UTC,100% yes. Fully waterproof in case that is your desire and from what i can tell they distinguish between targets about the same. I think the 5x8 coil does better in trashy areas than the mxt would and with the 8.5x11 in less trashy areas they are fairly similar. Display wise they are also quite similar but the AT Pro has Promode which gives off different volume signals for different depths which helps ALOT when coinshooting in parks etc. Overall i think the AT pro is the dollar for dollar king and has a really simple learning curve. I started using pro zero mode directly out of the box and about 20 minutes into my first hunt i had it figured out. No joke my first day with the at pro i dug a 1942 walking liberty half dollar at 9+ inches. I was instantly sold and havent had even a single problem since.

metaldetecting,33chrv,GoopyBoots,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"YES the iron audio is another super nice feature! I still dig the bottle caps but i know ahead of time now lol. got quite a few rings in the same range, and coins with nails."
metaldetecting,33chrv,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that (I've heard) the 5x8 coil can help pick apart the coins/iron a little better than the stock coil. Great for trashy areas.   I've got a total boner for coins anyways so that's really all I'm after to be honest. Iron audio tells me that I'd be wasting my time on most signals <6""-8"". After that I'll dig it (assuming it isn't a very large target) If you're after rings, the general consensus seems to be to dig all iffy signals regardless of the iron audio unless it sounds like a dog with asthma growling at you."
metaldetecting,33chrv,GoopyBoots,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:34:25 2015 UTC,ya if im hunting jewelry it will usually be because i tried digging only deep coin signals and gotten 2-3 trash targets so i say screw it and start digging all signals that ring up 67+. Ive also found that indian head pennys will ring up a bit low and sometimes even growl with some iron audio by mistake. So i dig most bottle cap signals now unless im really coinshooting hard.
metaldetecting,33chrv,LeftyHyzer,3,Wed Apr 22 12:04:47 2015 UTC,"Don't overlook buying used. I was in the same boat, looking to upgrade the f2 and was considering the at pro. I was surprised to find that used top end detectors could be had with headphones and pinpointer for only a hundred or two more then a new at pro.   Don't get me wrong, the at pro is a great machine. I just kept thinking to myself ""when will I want to upgrade again, one...two years?"" I decided to wait a few extra months and save the money for a used Etrac and I couldn't be happier."
metaldetecting,33chrv,SaintAnthonysFire,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, but having an extra mid-level detector every so often can serve as great back-up detectors for those who might want to tag along. Great way to get others involved.   I was going to go the route you suggested but I decided to pass on something used, buy an AT pro new and use the money I might have used to buy a used (insert better detector) to buy a back up/guest pro-pointer for those who might tag along. Mostly my 15 year old cousin.   Take that for what it's worth, I have people that have shown interest in the hobby so I chose to make an effort to include them.

Took some time but it really paid off. I also called up every pawn shop within 3 hours of my house and told them to contact me if any high end detectors came through their doors. Also got ahold of every detecting store I could find and asked about used machines. I also kept an eye out for machines for sale on the big detecting forums.   With high end machines you come across a lot of older men who bought them on a wim thinking it would be something they would enjoy. They end up realizing it wasn't what they expected and sell the machine at a hell of a deal. Most of the time the machine still has a year or more warranty left on it.   I was worried that I was going to get ripped off, but the guy I bought mine off of was very open and honest and stayed in contact via phone through the whole process.

metaldetecting,33a2db,Cliintoris,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:25:49 2015 UTC,"I second that suggestion. I don't know how people get on without one. There are cheaper and more expensive ones but the Garrett is kinda of the standard. I have one and it works great.   On technique, as you get better with your detector - and depending on the size of the coil - you will be able to narrow down where the target is within a square foot. At this point you use the hand help pointer to find its exact spot. This doesn't always work depending on depth of target but it general it reduces the amount of digging you have to do. Once you've got your plug out the pointer will help find the target if it isn't immediately obvious."

If you are interested in detecting the next big thing you will need is a pinpointer which is basically a handheld detector that helps SO MUCH with finding things once you've dug the hole, which seems to be something you are struggling with from your story of the old house. The best value one is sold at Harbor Freight and is around 16$. More expensive ones work better but usually run around 80-100$.    The last thing to make sure and do is check with your parents to find help figuring out where you can detect. SOme states and cities allow detecting in parks, some don't.

Tips: make sure you have great headphones. I use to take a huge refrigerator box and flatten it out. I would tape every type of coin, every type of common trash on the back. (not too close) then throw it on the ground coin side down and detect it. I would use it to learn pin pointing and the sounds. Take your time. It helps. In the beginning, I would dig everything, and I mean everything and make a mental note of the tone. Another tip to help eliminate those questionable tones. I normally detect with discrimination turned way down, when I get a hit I keep slowly turning up discrimination until the sound starts to break up. Learning where different trash items drop off can help in Identifying a target as well. Hope this helps. Good luck."

All kinds of lame excuses just because they don't want to deal with having another person hanging around on their property. And who blames them, really. I can understand that.  But with the few that say yes - or maybe - I'll quickly make an agreement on which months I'll come, and let them know I will always phone/text them before I show up, and I'll stay away from crops, and whatever I find I'll show them so will have an idea what's buried under the surface. In the end you'll find some nice farmers that will let you do whatever you want, whenever you feel like. I spent the whole last year's summer on two farmers' fields. Well worth asking like 30 other places to find those two."

metaldetecting,32visd,MattBaster,4,Fri Apr 17 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"These pieces are the only finds I still have from my metal detecting days about twenty years ago.  The location was my dad’s 140 acre farm in the Ozarks (the Missouri side), and there were three “sites” I used to hunt with my el-cheap-o metal detector.  Two of the old sites yielded your average farm stuff: horseshoes, big plow blades, square nails, wire fragments, etc.  I once found fragments from a busted up sleigh bell.  But one site, which was purported to have burned down around 1900 (leaving no visible traces on the surface after so much time had passed), gave me the most exciting stuff.  Here are three of the best things which I still have in my possession:    •  US Civil War belt buckle (with lead backing and fasteners)    •  Half of a US Civil War Belt Buckle plate (with small traces of lead backing)    •  Unidentified bronze cast weighing about four pounds. This piece puzzles me the most (more info in the album comments).  I wouldn’t even have high hopes for getting it ID’d at /r/whatisthis    My uncle took a couple of other pieces back to TN with him to “restore”, but unfortunately they were permanently lost in a house fire of his own.  He lost tens of thousands of dollars of his own Civil War relics, it was a shame.  But the pieces I found were two haves from a “Colt” powder flask.  I found each half separately, about 20 feet apart.  To the best I can recall, it looked very much like this one, except it had been buried in the dirt for a century and the top was never found.  For all I know, the top could still be out there waiting to be discovered with a good quality metal detector.  After lurking for long enough in this sub, I thought the /r/metaldetecting community might enjoy.  Thanks for looking!"

metaldetecting,32rovy,metalfish,0,Thu Apr 16 04:18:05 2015 UTC,"the two arent even close. however DO NOT buy from amazon.    Amazon is 100% msrp or even higher prices. Whereas dealers are required to advertise msrp but if you email them or call them they will likely drop their price by as much as 20-30%. The margins in detecting are very good so dealers have alot more wiggle room than most people think. For instance i got an AT pro, bag, headphones, shovel, and garrett pinpointer for 600$, when all that was advertised on the guys site who i bought it from for nearly $1100."
metaldetecting,32rovy,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:24:51 2015 UTC,No one would beat Amazon's price on a eurotek pro when I called around. They certainly aren't going to beat their shipping or return process.

There are like 15 sponsors on there and many of them will do special deals for fellow members. If amazon is currently matching or beating vendor prices that's 100% news to me. In the past the constant answer of the community is to tell people to avoid amazon and ebay at all costs. I know personally I bought my first detector on amazon and then when I saw the prices on MDF.com I was shocked. It was close to half.
metaldetecting,32rovy,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"are you of member of metaldetectingforum.com?     Nope. I made a post here this year if I should go with Amazon on the low end or call around. I even had someone from Kellyco respond to my post. At the end of the day no one would come off of MSRP so why give them business? I'm really glad I went with Amazon tbh. My unit was defective and I had a new one on my doorstep within 48 hours at no cost, no questions asked."
metaldetecting,32rovy,JethroMcClintock,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:09:54 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think that's a pretty unfair and inaccurate assessment of amazon. I'm also not a fan of detecting bundles, most times they throw in a bunch of junk you don't need."
metaldetecting,32rovy,SaintAnthonysFire,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"The general consensus has always been that traditional retailers are unable to meet the prices of vendors because of retailers inability to bargain. A vendor can take whatever price they want, even a loss, but amazon cannot. Their employees are unable to change prices. Is it possible that amazon could potentially offer a blockbuster sale here and there that could potentially beat a vendor price? Yes. But are 99.9% of the metal detectors on amazon over a vendor price? Yes. Amazon is overpriced compared to what vendors are capable of offering and that is fact.    As to the bundles i mostly agree, the ""pack"" i bought was not the At pro adventure pack it was the at pro and stock headphones, a lesche digger. and garret PP. all separate items. Most of the ""guides"", bags, and apparel that come with packs are total crap, and a fanny pack serves the same purpose."
metaldetecting,32rovy,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:26:25 2015 UTC,Amazon isn't a traditional retailer. A lot of what you see on amazon is being sold by a vendor.
metaldetecting,32rovy,SaintAnthonysFire,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yes with a set price point on listed items. If you were to buy something at a reduced price you would need to contact the vendor bypassing amazon all together as ive suggested. No metal detecting vendor lists their lowest price, they list the price with the best ratio of sales. But they will take a lower amount if you contact them because its a guaranteed sale. Ive had a vendor tell me he was essentially making 10$ of my order when i bought my ace 250. He just did it for a contact and future business plus profit is profit."

I have a feeling it may be related to upholstery because the Back has a non familiar closure. The picture shows the metal was peaned over the single band. The other ""pin"" is broken/missing. The inner ring wraps around like a horseshoe then comes up and over on top of itself.  Not sure if the picture depicts that clearly.  My question. Was this for clothing or upholstery?

All of the cartridges I have found i the past were 30-06, 30-300, and 8mm calibers.  This bullet is much bigger.  Also, most rifle slugs out there are solid on the  front and back, but this one has a distinct cone shaped  hole in the back.  Thoughts?  Second, what kind of too do you suppose the iron piece could be? Since is it rather wedge shaped (thin for a wedge I know) I speculated it would be a 'felling wedge' used to help a much larger tree fall during cutting with an ax? Or maybe it was a splitting wedge? Thoughts?  Lastly, my friend a week prior found an Elgin pocket watch patented 1886, e with Mary ... December 1888 inscribed on the back.  Fast forward to now, I found the pocket watch face cover, and I believe It has P.Day inscribes on the inside.  Perhaps this meant Pay Day?  Thanks and happy hunting yall!"

Local park that has been hunted fairly hard by a couple other detectors over the years. One of them just bought a Deus XP and hearing him tell of the silvers he's dug in the last 5 months got me really motivated/envious. BigBoysHobbies has a deal going on where the digger special has a nice t-handle shovel included with it. Honestly makes me wish I would have waited another month back when I bought my Fisher F4 about a year ago (it already has problems) and just bought the AT Pro in the first place."

This led to me detecting some very marginal sites and I ended up with few old coins. Then, I read online where someone said that if you persistently detect a location, there's always at least one nice find that was missed by previous detectorists - that totally changed my attitude and I've yet to find the place where that does not hold true. If I were you, I'd pick the most obvious, oldest park in your town and keep going until you find something old. You may need to upgrade your detector but you will get something old eventually."

I recently received a Garrett Ace 250 and Garrett Pro-Pointer for my birthday. Both are great! They are accurate and very beginner friendly.  As someone above stated, definitely get yourself a pinpointer. I was able to find a lot more with the help of one.   Also, think outside the box when it comes to locations. My first successful hunt was a beach/campground, but I've got my eye on an old one room school house. Vacant lots where old houses once were are great, too.

If you are getting a bunch of crazy false readings, raise your detector in the air, and shake it a little. That's how I diagnose if it's the ground or the detector malfunctioning. Keep the sensitivity in the mid to low range. It gets crazy sensitive sometimes if it's wet. Goodluck!"

metaldetecting,31oywz,beerplague,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:37:54 2015 UTC,These are the best finds I had. I cleaned them after I made sure they were not key dates. I know that is a big no no but they were so caked in crud that you could barely tell they were pennies.
metaldetecting,31oywz,YEE_YEE_2015,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:39:59 2015 UTC,"Cleaning them like you did really isn't that big of a deal.  What most people mean by cleaning, is those people who let their old coins and tarnished metals sit in cleaning for so long that the protective patina is washed away meaning that they make an old wheat penny for example have the same shine as a modern untarnished penny.  In your case, you cleaned off the crud correctly so that the tarnish/patina remain.  When I clean old pennies such as ""wheaties"" or older finds, I do one of these three methods below  -For dirt that is loosely clinging to the coin   run them under warm water and gently brush away the dirt with a soft bristle tooth brush   -For coins with dirt that caked them so much that it seems like concrete   I let them sit in a diluted mixture of squeezed lemon juice and water (1 part fresh squeezed lemon: 5-6 parts warm tap water) for no more than 2 minutes before using the tooth brush.   It should be noted here that you may wish to practice this cleaning method with more common clad coins you find until you get the feel for it so older and more valuable coins do not get ruined.  -For dirt that is stuck to the coin to the point that a long soak is necessary to remove it without damaging the patina   let them soak in olive oil for a couple days before using the same tooth brush   With this method, while it takes the longest to get results, it is the safest method to cleaning coins of all metal types as the olive oil will not harm the patina, eat away at the metals, or have any other adverse effects on the coin.  I hope this helps!"

You want to scan a 2D surface (the ground) so deploying a device that can operate in 3 dimensions is over complicating.    I'm no engineer, but you could probably make a tow-behind trailer with a large coil slung under it, and a tiny computer on board to record tones from the headphone output on, say, an AT Pro box, recording the frequencies of the tones with some sort of spatial information.  GPS wouldn't granular enough, as it's got a resolution of a few meters.  Not sure how you'd do that."
metaldetecting,31hhrt,arthropal,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:07:45 2015 UTC,I agree with this. The quadcopter introduces significant engineering hurdles in comparison to a simple ground based vehicle.

It then goes ahead.. ..algorithm.. ..most efficiently.   Possible, yeah. But it would take some real engineering and I doubt you'd really find the interest. I think you may be breaking into the field of archaelogy a bit. I think they have designed methods to scan large tracts of land at one time via some technology that escapes me now. Ultrasonic maybe?   Anyhow, something that you controlled remotely (rather than automated) and that acted as a flying metal detector in the most basic sense, simply sending back the results to you as you operate and scan the ground remotely via camera seems like a more realistic type of quad-copter metal detector imo."

Woods hunting definitely has a small hunting time frame.  When it comes to old farm houses and such I have never had much luck. Lots of farm related trash and the people were often very poor. Best places to hunt are old gathering areas, paths, and along water."

After a stressful day working at the hospital, I relax a bit with my white DFX.   Short description (forgot to save it in Imgur)   Silver ring (900/1000) with turquose, would date it 1850-1900. A so called 'lakenlood' (cloth lead), 1650-1700. Leiden was famous for its cloth, and exported it around the world. A piece of lead would be attached to guarantee its authenticity. I'm not sure what the description means (doubel stael geblaut). It's quite large (ca. 6cm); normally they are <3 cm. a bronze (?) ring, possibly <1500. I could not find the stone though. 3 pfennig Munster, 1703 1 duit Kleef, 1697 1 cent 1921, Wilhelmina (1880-1962) 1 cent 1942, war coinage.

metaldetecting,312gpp,jd428jd,3,Wed Apr 1 16:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much the only way I found out the creek it was located on was through one thread of a forum discussion which helped my research and lead to a newspaper article which mentioned the creek.  I have also tried to take into account the flood plain from the river which flows perpendicular to the creek which acts as a tributary.    Obviously, they would not want to set up a permanent camp that was there for the duration of the war I believe in an area that may flood.  Do you  think that a war time map showing land deeds/titles of the county would show the camp?  I certainty hope so because I don't think they were making topo maps like they did in the 20th century  back during the Civil War."
metaldetecting,312gpp,jd428jd,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:22:35 2015 UTC,It's possible that it is referenced on post war maps as as a land mark. And possession of the property may have changed as a result of the war so that would surely be documented. Also if any major battles were fought near by then it is likely a permanent  encampment would be noted on a map.

My stock e-trac battery(nickel metal hydride?) after a few years started losing its overall charge and I'm lucky to get 3-4 hours out of it if that from the 8 I used to get. The lithium, you get full power out of the machine up until its dead, unlike the stock where when the battery is draining, the machine will start losing power and causing the machine to act funny on its last bar or so. I have the 2900mah RnB lithium battery and I get 28-30 hours out of one charge. The 3100 is the newer improved version of the same battery. These will also hold 80-90% of their charge for the whole year. If you don't want to fight with charging batteries all the time, its worth the investment."

That 1909 wheatie is in great shape, and even if it's not the super-rare S-VDB, it's still a scarce coin and nice find.  I'll bet there are other keepers waiting for you at that spot - looking forward to seeing what else you dig up. Congrats!"

metaldetecting,306nar,rpg25,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:08:54 2015 UTC,I know from OP's pic it doesn't look likely but I've seen a few on /r/coins that didn't look like it at first.  It's worth having someone take a look at least.  Couldn't hurt the value.
metaldetecting,306nar,LyndsySimon,2,Wed Mar 25 01:24:34 2015 UTC,The rare and valuable coin you are referring to is a 1909 S VDB. The S is a mint mark and stands for San Fransisco. You don't even have to look at the reverse to tell this is not that coin because mint marks are located under the year on the obverse and are visible with the naked eye. This coin has no S under the 1909 so it's safe to say it's not the 1909 S VDB.
metaldetecting,306nar,saucypanther,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:48:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, S is worth a ton but both the S and non can be worth money.  Even a circulated one without the S mint mark can be worth $10 or more.  http://imgur.com/a/Ffgye#k8plOFc  Doesn't look like it but this is also a VDB.  And you can't tell at first."

But this legend will make your metal detecting that much more exciting. You don't have to devote your life to it. Try it a couple of days. Dig up the junk you find, and you will learn a lot about your detector and detecting along the way. One day you may become frustrated and give up, but at least you will have tried and gained skills in the process.  Read the last page of this pdf.  Also, check out these old indian territory maps for clues."

metaldetecting,304ikn,AllPurposeGrunt,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:36:40 2015 UTC,Have we been in the same caves? Lol
metaldetecting,304ikn,LyndsySimon,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"It's possible I suppose, but I doubt it. There are a lot of caves in that area, and all of the ones I know well are on private property.  That said, I can also attest to the fact that there are a lot of unexpected things in that area. I know of one cave - or maybe you're call it a small cave system - that has been used for at least 150 years as a hideaway from the law. The largest room is shaped like an inverted funnel, and the very top of it is opens up into an inaccessible overhang. The walls are black, as the previous occupants have built fires there, presumably to cook. The smoke will rise out of the cave and into the overhang, then dissipate into a cedar thicket above. There is no smoke visible from the surface, and you can't even smell it unless you're standing almost directly above.  To get back into it, you have to crawl for about 10 yards. It's not a really tight squeeze, but it's small enough that you can barely stay up on your hands and knees. The real kicker, at least for me - there's a damned brass bedframe inside! At some point, someone had to have brought it in piece by piece and re-assembled it inside. I was there in the early 90s, and the property owner's grandfather told me that the bed had been in the cave as long as he remembers - he was born in the 30s, so I'm guessing it's been there for at least a century at this point.  In another cave we came across a human skull, which freaked us out more than a bit. I was a teenager at the time, and the person I was with was going to take it home and call the police. I urged him not to, and after we looked around for a while - literally looked, and didn't touch anything - we found that the person the skull had belonged to apparently died there. The bones had been scattered a bit by scavengers, but there was a dark spot off to one side of the cave that was a fire pit at one time. Nearby were dozens of small white seashells, each with holes in them as if they had been attached to something. It was quickly apparent that we'd found the site of an Indian's death. It could have been as late as the late 19th Century, or it could have been much older; we decided the best and most respectful thing to do was leave him in peace, and that's what we did.  There are also numerous abandoned mines in the area. Most of the shafts have been closed up, but some of them are probably unknown by anyone except the property owners and those of us who grew up in those woods. The town where I went to school is called Lead Hill, because of the lead mines that were active in that area at one time."

metaldetecting,304ikn,plausabletruth,2,Tue Mar 24 16:59:37 2015 UTC,That's one of my problems. Outside of word of mouth I don't know if any additional information about this treasure.

And while the piece on the right does line up with the lip of the other piece, there's not a lot of curve to them. Meaning that the open space between them is barely more than an inch. They're more like two plates that fit together.  These two pieces were found about five feet apart, buried under about two inches of forest litter (the detector sensor was totally overloaded, made 'em easy to find :-). My wife and I have been all around the area but haven't turned up anything else but some bent nails.  We're planning to do a methodical scan of the area at some time in the near future, hoping to find a piece with some more or all of the company name, or possibly some attached part, like a handle."

Imagine your standing in the woods, and you see a bunch of pinetrees. More than likely someone planted them. Go investigate. See a strange flat hill or path? Line of trees in a perfect pattern?

Wow you will find things that you wish you knew what it was! That's ok! What's this chunk of iron? Hell if I know! Bring a truck because you will have a bed full of scrap by the end of the day. Farms always uncover strange but interesting finds.  I never find an extreme amount of silver or valuable coins on farms, usually because many farmers weren't flashing their money. You never know! If he has a big yard, I like to do a grid pattern, kinda like if you were mowing a lawn.   Remember, farmers liked to hide coins in walls! Run your detector over any old homestead foundations. Another thing I like to do with farms, is that most of the  time they have ""bottle dumps"". I like to spend a little time and go through the bottles and see if any old crock pots or pottery made it out unscathed!  Best of luck, and take your time. You will be sore after a long day.

metaldetecting,2yn1ap,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"The AT Pro is likely the last detector you will ever need. Land, water, beaches, it does them all.    Make sure you try out both the Pro mode and Std mode. Pro will give you varying volume signals depending on depth. This can be especially helpful when your coil is over aluminum or big pieces of iron. Regularly these would ring up as 3-4 inches coin or good signals but with pro mode they will be LOUD as hell, which will tell you just from hearing it its something big closer to the surface than it reads.    I also heavily recommend getting iron audio on and UP from the get go. The number of times ive dug a rusty cap and said ""ahh thats what that iron growl was all about!"" I still dig all signals but i dont get my hopes up if i hear and iron grunt."

It's also good to know to use the pinpoint button. Hearing it sound on something non-iron.. got a little excited. Doug down and about 6 inches down was a small zipper off a pair of old Lee jeans, made of copper. I smiled in the dark because I felt accomplished in recognizing the sound, pinpointing it, and confirming the detector didn't let me down.

metaldetecting,2y8z9g,A-mei_fan,5,Sat Mar 7 21:56:33 2015 UTC,They make a trash can lids with magnets for dishwashers stations in restaurant kitchens...

metaldetecting,2y72cs,eclectro,4,Sat Mar 7 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"The best value in pin pointers is the Deteknix, and there are resellers on ebay that offer a good price. For those that disagree, the Deteknix can be found for $85 to $90 new shipped. As compared to Garrett and Minelab which can go anywhere from $130 to $200. Reviews indicate that Deteknix performs as well or better.  You can find various Bounty Hunter detectors (and their Radio Shack) equivalents used on ebay. I'm thinking a Time Ranger that occasionally pop ups for $120. At the low end, I'd find a Freedom Ace Plus detector (I found one locally for $20), as the coils are the same for the Garret ace series and can be used on it. Those can be found on ebay for around $70 - 90 dollars shipped sometimes. However, if serviceability might be an issue for you, go with a White's that can be repaired. Non-working detectors do find a market on ebay (though don't bring good prices). Coils and rods (i.e. plastics) tend to break the most, and they can be found relatively easily online.   People have learned to use the low end Tracker IV detector quite well, though it does have a considerable learning curve and takes considerable patience and work. This is as low as I would go. Stay away from Harbor Freight detectors and other ""6"" or ""9"" function detectors (similar to the ""gold digger"" also), as they're going to be limited to the first three inches. The great thing about the Tracker IV detector is that it often shows up used with low prices in local classifieds. Which might offer other potential low cost finds especially with garage sale season around the corner.  So, to have a decent experience, I'd save up at least another $90. I really think that discontinued Radio Shack detectors and high end Bounty hunters might be the best value in used detectors at the moment imho. Sorry to go over budget, but another poster was correct, you'll be disappointed with equipment that is too low end."

But I would not sweat it if you don't get it. Some stuff appears on a regular basis e.g. monthly so you'll get another try eventually. Use the ebay ""follow"" function in ""my ebay"" to send you an email when it shows up again.   I got a great deal on this locally, and purchased this for around $35.  The thing that I really like about this detector is that it is multi tone as compared to the Whites Idx pro that is not multi tone without a mod.  I actually meant to say that in my parent post, that multi-tone is a feature to definitely look for. This is something that the ""quicksilver"" by bounty hunter does not have iirc. And they sell a zillion of those on ebay for $90.  The only drawback is the used stuff really does not have a warranty."

Either way an artifact in that condition regardless of age is usually a scrap pile item and not worth much if anything.

HOWEVER cheap detectors are notoriously easy to modify to make fanny pack mods where you remove the housing unit and place it inside of a waterproof box, which usually costs around 20-30$, then attach a strap and into the water you go. These mods work best with cheap and new detectors however, like ace 150-250s and bounty hunters.

Digging with the raptor in dry conditions without ruining the grass is very difficult. If you're in the woods and/or there are roots in the ground I would also go with the lesche.  If you have soft ground conditions I'd use the raptor because you can still cut a decent plug and it's way easier to scoop dirt out of the hole compared with the lesche. When I'm using the Lesche, I have to remove most of the dirt with my hands, whereas the raptor does most of that work when I use it.   I use a White's machine and occasionally send stories to them. They include them on their website and send you a $50 gift certificate in return. Last time I checked you can do it once every 6 months. So over the years I've gotten about 3 or 4 free lesches from them. I received the raptor as a gift.   Overall I think if you're only going to get one of the two I'd go with the Lesche. You can dig through just about anything with it, and it's way more versatile. You'll just have to get a good pair of gloves for the dirt removing."
metaldetecting,2x89fy,swb2013,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:08:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for your review of both diggers. I pulled the trigger on a raptor a few days ago and am waiting for it to arrive. The ground around here gets every dry and hard during the summer but to use the raptor more than my lesche.

She was used to transport passengers and supplies to New France (in present day Canada), making several trips. Nearing the end of her last voyage, a storm blew her onto some rocks on August 27, 1725. She sank, with the loss of all aboard; estimates range as high as 316 dead.

metaldetecting,2vki1k,plausabletruth,2,Wed Feb 11 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"you know I honestly think it's down to the detector  I've been using my Ace 250 for about 4 or 5 years now  I am lucky enough to have lots of perfect locations around me, thousands of years old, populated continuously from then until now  i've searched them and never, ever found anything old with my Ace.  The oldest thing I have found is a lead bag seal from 1821   now when there were Romans in the area that isn't old is it? why nothing from the 1400s or 1500s?   i just don't think the ace 250 goes anywhere deep enough to get you anything old and i need to upgrade to something better why is the Ace so heavily recommended? the depth just doesn't cut it"
metaldetecting,2vki1k,JeffersonDavis,2,Wed Feb 11 21:10:49 2015 UTC,Are you searching plowed farm fields? Because plowing often brings up older stuff (roman stuff).  I metal detected for a day in england in a couple of plowed fields and found some late 1800s coins (just coppers that were hardly even recognizable).   Note: The ace is often recommended as a starter detector. Something to kind of try out for a year or so to introduce yourself to the hobby. To know if you are serious enough to maybe go on to a more expensive/sophisticated machine.  My starter metal detector was a bounty hunter quickdraw. And I found some pretty deep silver coins with it (nothing incredibly old though... mostly from the 40s).   Try making a test garden. Go out an bury some items (coins and such) in various depths to see if your metal detector can see them.  A lot of the hobby is basically going out ot a site and basically findng nothing good. I always assume by default that I will likely find nothing decent.
metaldetecting,2vki1k,JeffersonDavis,2,Wed Feb 11 21:12:56 2015 UTC,"i've tried everything mate, plowed fields, pastures that aren't farmed, river banks  my Garrett just doesn't get anything earlier than 1800's. Lead minie balls and musket balls and bag seals and the corroded coins you mentioned  but nothing old. i think you need to get lucky twice to get something ancient with the 250  lucky the first time to encounter it and lucky again that it happens to be shallow enough for a brief period for the ace to pick it up"

metaldetecting,2vbguj,Esrange,6,Mon Feb 9 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"Couple days ago my friend found a silver bar. It was around 3-4 feets deep in the ground, wrapped with big nails all around it. It have a bit more than 14 OZ and around 6 inches. There aren't any marks on it and it seems like it has been damaged in the fire or something similar. It is not magnetic and i am 99% sure it is silver because edges are cleaned and it looks like silver.   If there is any way to identify it and to know from what year it is that would be great..."
metaldetecting,2vbguj,GoopyBoots,12,Mon Feb 9 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"new lead can look close to silver. Here's what I would do.    Get a container large enough to hold the bar + liquid Fill the container all the way to the top with water and weigh it. Write that number down.  Take the container off the scale and place the bar inside, the liquid should spill over the top.  Remove the bar, now weigh the container and water again, minus the liquid that spilled over the top and the bar.  Now you've got a weight of water that it displaced, which can be converted to a volume. (one cubic inch of water is 0.578oz)  multiply your density of the bar in oz/in3 by 1.729 to get your density in g/cm3.  Silver has a density of 10.49g/cm3 and lead has a density of 11.34g/cm3.    Hopefully this will get you close, or just take it in to a local cash4gold or something, they'll be able to tell you.   And of course, I'm just a guy on the internet so don't trust these numbers 100%"

metaldetecting,2vbguj,MagicJohnson96,3,Mon Feb 9 21:19:06 2015 UTC,Silver is highly conductive of heat. It should melt a ice cube like a bugger. Copper is similar.  Perhaps a local coin shop would be willing to do an acid test.

It's been awhile so it's a bit fuzzy in my memory but I did a lot of tests/reading and narrowed it down to either titanium or tungsten.    I'll have to see if the local university has anyone experienced enough in metallurgy to identify it conclusively.

I do NOT have the water proof headphones so I've never done a dive. I also own and use a Vibra Quatic 2 which is a under water pin-pointer that is an OUTSTANDING asset.  The biggest bitch is rocky riverbed. Digging and pinpointing for small objects can be a real pain in the ass. I use a Gerber folder shovel that handles the rock very well.  2nd toughest issue is trying to see though the ripples. I strongly suggest polarized glasses with a strap to keep them on your head. Dig facing UP RIVER.   You still have the standard ratio of a hundred pieces of trash to one ok find. You will find LOTS of lead sinkers and sharp/rusted hooks that are VERY stabby. Buy a waterproof Box for keys and phone. Good slip resistant shoes are good. I rock Keens in warm weather and hip waders for cold water.   Any more questions or need for tips, feel free to ask!"

metaldetecting,2uref6,mrhelton,3,Wed Feb 4 18:41:13 2015 UTC,I would wear shoes. Something that can slip off if you feel the suction will trap you. Mud can be dangerous. Edit: i had an instance where i stepped into a deep mud spot. My foot sank in up to my knee but it made me fall forward. I may have drown if i didnt get my foot unstuck.   Also.....ALWAYS LET SOMEONE KNOW where you are if you go out solo. A slip and fall can leave you injured without assistance. I know it sound wierd but if you go missing people know where you were last.

metaldetecting,2uhwkn,kevin_guitars,3,Mon Feb 2 07:45:44 2015 UTC,"I tried this once at a hunted out park that dated back to at least 1877 (the oldest plat maps I could find of it). It must have been hit heavily over the years because I hardly found anything but a mercury dime and maybe 5 wheaties. OR... the ground may have been moved around a lot (landscaping etc etc).  I did this after finding an incredibly worn 1856 seated liberty dime on the edge of a new concrete pad that had recently been put in. All the dirt around the edge was freshly disturbed. I suspected that there MUST be deeper stuff in the rest of the immediate area.  What I did was dig up ANY really deep signal that registered anything close to a coin. I'd walk while sweeping and if I got any signal that was deep... I would swing over the spot maybe 10 times. If it came up as a coin signal once during any sweep... I dug it.  I dug up some deep rusted small nail fragments, but I also came away with another seated dime, and a couple of barber dimes from the late 1800s and early 1900s.  edit: About 1930s wheaties that are 8 inches deep? From my experience that is unusual for MY particular area. Not usually THAT deep. I am in Missouri, so I dont know about Florida soil. It could very well be par for the course there. If I was finding 30s wheaties that were THAT deep in my Missouri soil?... I'd suspect that there had been some moving around of the soil (landscaping etc etc). Also... keep in mind that just because the current house was built in the 1940s... it doesnt mean there could not have been a house there before that time. My parents old farmhouse was built in the 1960s, but after looking at some plat maps I discovered that there was an earlier house there that dated back to the very early 1900s. The original could have burnt down."
metaldetecting,2uhwkn,dirtymoney,2,Mon Feb 2 12:51:35 2015 UTC,"When it comes to depth in public parks I live by a few generalities:    1.) The deeper a target is, the less likely anyone would dig it up. Well duh! But essentially a pull tab giving off a coin signal at 2"" will get dug 99% of the time whereas a coin signal at 10"" will not be dug unless it is ringing in super consistently. This means dig deeper signals with slightly increased confidence.    2.) The deeper the signal the less likely the signal is accurate. A coin at 12"" can ring up god-knows-what on most machines IF you are lucky enough to even get a signal. In general the deeper an object is the less likely it will ring up unless its BIG. If you pull your coil off the ground 2-3 inches and it rings in the same it is NOT a coin, just move on.    3.) Depth is a good indicator but not an absolute indicator of age. Depending on your soil type, amount of fill thats been done, presence of rocks in the soil depth and age can vary greatly. Ive found indian heads in public parks at 2.5"" (no joke) and ive found clad 1980s+ coins at 6"". Generally rocks in the soil can hang up objects and hold them there for hundreds of years."
metaldetecting,2uhwkn,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"I don't get how people find coin sized stuff that deep but maybe it's the soil in the region I detect in.  Lots of clay.     Generally speaking neither of my detectors will pick up a coin if it's more then an inch into clay soil.   I've got a bounty hunter sharp shooter II and a minelab Explorer XS.       It seems like coins/small stuff usually won't work itself deep in clay on it's own though, not unless the soil gets disturbed somehow.    I've found civil war stuff just under the grass/topsoil but sitting right in the top layer of clay.     When I first got these detectors back in 2001ish, I buried some coins at various depths and was surprised to find they would not show up if I buried them more then like 2"" in clay."

I understand that you are willing to spend a little more to avoid needing to upgrade after a short time. This is a good idea if you can afford it. I would caution against buying anything really cheap because you will get poor results and quickly lose interest.  If you are on a small budget, I recommend getting a modern but gently used detector rather than wasting your money on something cheap and poorly made.  Whether you buy new or used,  I would stick to the most popular brands such as Garrett, Whites, Fisher, Minelab, Tosoro. I started with a Garrett Ace 350 and found lots of coins and relics in the two years I used it. I then upgraded to the Garrett AT Pro. I started with the Ace because I wanted to learn the basics without too many features to figure out and I also didn't want to spend a ton of money on a new hobby before I was sure that I was going to enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The bottom line is like most things, you get what you pay for.

Perhaps the best freshwater detecter there is and costs less than alof of its peers.    1000-2000$ (Minelab E-trac & Minelab CTX30-30)Minelab seems to make the best high end machines on the market, but they are WAY too advanced for any beginner to even think about buying as a first detecter   Bonus: EVERY starting detector needs a pinpointer dispite what anyone will tell you.

metaldetecting,2tulxa,arthropal,3,Tue Jan 27 15:56:21 2015 UTC,The ACE 250 was not built for salt water. Salt water hunting requires a different technology entirely - either pulse induction or multi-frequency. The 250 is a single frequency machine.

metaldetecting,2tiynm,JeffersonDavis,2,Sat Jan 24 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the fisher F2. A bit more money but it works well and is a good starter detector and easy to use. It will last you a long while. Also, pick up a Garret pinpointer and a Lesche digging tool and some gloves :0)  I got mine off of kellyco and it came with 2 coils, the 8 inch and the 4 inch sniper coil. I suggest getting 2 coils to play around with, you can find some good package deals but if you go with kellyco, the fisher pinpointer they give you is basically shit so go with spending the extra money with a Garrett pinpointer. You won't be disappointed. Also, check out some YouTube video reviews on the detectors you are interested in before you buy. Just make sure they are not sponsored videos :0)"
metaldetecting,2tiynm,saucypanther,2,Sat Jan 24 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"for a few extra bucks you can get a Eurotek Pro which is essentially the newest version of the F2.

With that said, I tried to research on this forum the $100ish or less range of metal detectors on this subreddit to not much avail -- I have a feeling most people on here lean towards the more moderate 150-200+ range. I hope to have it soon to do some testing to see how its performance is. I think there would be something said for a database of some sort that actually measures performance of every model on the market sorted by price range (if this exists, let me know, I've been looking for it!). Just to see how much is given up/sacrificed in a lower model -- both feature wise, depth, etc so people can make more informed decisions. With me, I had a budget because I had Amazon gift card and I wasn't looking to get into metal detecting above that price just yet, and I was willing to take the risk to see how this one is. Worst that happens is if it's terrible, could sell or return and I can always upgrade in the future."

I find if you're concerned, generally speaking Amazon's customer service is literally some of the best around, so it makes purchasing things on there low-risk.   Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about it. I just want something, even if it's not as great at discriminating metal types or even if it isn't as deep as others, if it works a good number of inches down (let's say 6 inches) or so, I'd be happy. I can just sell it or return if its performance is so bad that I can't find anything.

I found this in the woods along an old trail that lead to a well known plantation (Styles Point Plantation).  It was VERY dirty and took a lot of work to see any of the metal below the buildup.  Whatever metal it is (still not sure, but plan to have it tested), it is not magnetic and it doesn't appear to have corroded at all while in the ground). I was able to scratch it, on mistake, in a few places, so it isn't too very hard.  The crust that had to be cleaned off was black and dark green. The metal itself is not corroded.  It is a fairly heavy/dense metal by the feel.  Looks like it might fit into something, since there is a long narrow pin or shaft(?) protruding from the back.  There are no threads or markings to indicate what it may be.  It measures 2in in diameter on its face and is about 1.5in in length from the tip of the pin to front of the face.  Any ideas?

I use that word because when you turn it all the way up it will give you feed back. You kick it back one notch at a time till that feedback goes away and that is your highest sensitivity (most depth and power)

Previous owner man DID bury all his savings and died in the house without recovering. The widow mentioned all their savings are still in the ground. My buddy has yet to search for it. So...finding that would be amazing.   I love finding colonial and early American coinage. I would love to find some colonials and even 1800's coin that is not completely deteriorated and worn out.

A silver coin cache (many silver coins that had been hidden and buried in a container).   A gold or silver pocket watch  A civil war Belt buckle (preferably southern army)  A meteorite.  Note: I live in the middle of the country so any hopes of finding any colonial coins or spanish silver/gold coins is completely dashed because that stuff isnt in my area. If I am VERY lucky I MIGHT find a coin that dates back to the early 1800s. But so far my oldest coin dates back to 1853 (silver seated dime).

I found it difficult to find a good medium between spending enough to make sure you're able to find what you want and not spending too much.  I ended up getting a great deal on a second hand higher end detector which was RRP $900 + a $120 pinpointer.  I also split the bill with my grandfather and we agreed we'd swap ownership occasionally, which makes things a lot more affordable.  It's a great bit of fun on the side if you know you're going to have a bit of free time and some potentially fertile countryside."

metaldetecting,2rwzvc,BNLboy,10,Sat Jan 10 00:36:56 2015 UTC,"Take a couple coins, sure.  With the AT Pro, the important things:   The control unit weather sealing. People leave them in the car in summer and it warps and busts the waterproof seal. It can be hard to spot, so if you're unsure ask if you can run it under a tap or in a shower. The whole machine is waterproof so there should be no problem. Check the orings on the headphone and coil connections, as these are the only defense against water damage. As well as the pins, the AT is a bit of a prick when it comes to changing the coils and it's easy to bend pins in a hurry. See if they used coil covers for the coils, or if they've scratched the shit out of the coils. battery compartment. Have a look for corrosion from leaving the batteries being left in there too long, as well as the oring on it.   That's about all I can think of! Good luck with it, they're a great machine."
metaldetecting,2rwzvc,ChrisCGray,3,Sat Jan 10 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the advice! And for responding so quick, I'm meeting the guy at 9am tomorrow. I'm so excited about buying my first real detector.  For your first two bullet points about the sealing and orings, will this affect use in everyday weather? I have no plans to be a water detector for now. I will check the pins out, he said it comes with an extra coil.   If a coil is scratched will it affect the performance? Or is scuffing someone common and I should look for more damage?"
metaldetecting,2rwzvc,ChrisCGray,2,Sat Jan 10 02:43:06 2015 UTC,"Correct, if you're just planning on dry use you won't have a problem. The only drawback is that it's really handy to be able to wash it under water after use.  Extra coil is a good thing. I've got the three Garrett ones, and the sniper is the one I use the least.  The coil being scratched shouldn't be a problem unless it's trashed. It affects resale more than anything."

It's in the original box and has the instructional dvd and an extra battery holder.  The seals all looked good and the battery compartment was clean.  I cant wait for the ground to thaw! I plan on getting a cover for the nicer looking coil to keep it from getting any more scratches."
metaldetecting,2rwzvc,metaldetectingstuff,2,Sat Jan 10 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"You ATPro looks in great shape - $475 for the detector, extra coil and the ProPointer is a good deal. Get yourself a good digging tool (I like my Lesche) and you'll be ready to go.  Minor scratches on the coil is nothing to be worried about - its just a sign of normal use. A coil cover is a good idea - I use them on my ATPro and haven't noticed any reduced sensitivity. It's easy to bump the coil against rocks and roots while swinging, and a cover is cheap and easy way to avoid doing real damage.  The ATPro is a solid machine - I'm very happy with mine. I'd also recommend getting the smaller 5x8 DD coil - I use mine frequently, especially in trashy areas and the woods.  Good luck!"

It was only after I got permission to hunt some private properties (a couple of old churchyards) that I started finding anything really old.  I also did some research using old maps and found old property sites in the woods of some big parks.  Another thing I did this year was join a local MDing club - it's been good to able to meet other MDers and we've had group hunts at some cool sites that I probably couldn't have gotten access to on my own.

I wasn't sure if it would be somehow construed as rude to ask someone to come detect the property.  I'll get an ad up on Craigslist shortly.
metaldetecting,2rcr6d,ImpalaPooge,2,Mon Jan 5 01:45:30 2015 UTC,"As the guy stated before, an enthusiast would love to help, and would most likely only ask for the happiness on your face, or at the most permission to hunt the rest of the property hoping to find an old silver quarter worth $3.50.  If you were in my area I'd already be there. No need to feel like your asking something too much of them, they (We) love this stuff"

metaldetecting,2rcr6d,Cohdee,4,Mon Jan 5 02:42:30 2015 UTC,I happen to have a metal detector but I'm near Conway. I work in Little Rock and probably wouldn't be able to come out until the weekend. If you can't find anyone else I'm willing to help. You could try Craigslist or TreasureNet (I would try TN first) to see if anyone can come sooner. Typically you can get someone to do it for free if you allow them to keep anything else that they find.   What kind of metal is the ring and do you know approximately were you lost it? Is this a 10 acre field or a .5 acre yard?
metaldetecting,2rcr6d,7daytrial,2,Mon Jan 5 05:32:06 2015 UTC,"I'll post on TreasureNet to see if anyone is around.  It's a white gold ring and I know where I was standing and which direction I was throwing stuff when I lost it. So it should be in one small section of my back yard somewhere. My whole lot is roughly .5 acre but the section it should be in is very small. Maybe 400 sqft or so (I haven't measured, could be larger or smaller)"

Check Craigslist or Facebook for people that recently got new detectors for Christmas and are looking to sell their old one. Also see if there is a metal detecting club in your area. Local clubs can be a great help and club members may let you try one of their backup detectors to see if you like it.  Good luck and happy hunting!"

Backstory: I have been metal detecting off and on (mostly off until recent) since I was about 10 when my grandpaws neighbour introduced me to his passion/hobby. Ever since then, for about the past 12 years, I have grown a friendship with him and we hunt when possible, and every Christmas he invited me over to show me his new finds, swap stories, and increase my education and interest through books.  This man, now in his 70s has been my metal detecting mentor of sorts and has taught me that a hobby/passion, no matter how odd it seems, is something to be proud of and pursue regardless of what others think.

It just very generic and id upgrade as soon as you can afford  Discrimation on the f2 is very simple, just descrim iron and dig everything if you wanna find the gold.

metaldetecting,2qj9i7,posty1188,3,Sat Dec 27 21:40:00 2014 UTC,Watch some vids on the propointer it makes a hell of a difference i can get about 3-4 inche away from the object which helps with find target alot
metaldetecting,2qj9i7,metal_militia_103,1 point,Sat Dec 27 22:26:47 2014 UTC,Just got my F2 out for some relic hunting today. I notched out the iron and tabs and it did fine. In high trash areas it went nuts and i had to reboot it twice.  Seems most accurate in open fields coimshooting so far. Pinpointer is ok but like someone said you have to be right on top of it for it to sound off. I do like the pin point mode on the F2 and use that frequently. Just experiment with different metals and depths and write down how they read. The digital readout will help you disc the prevelent trash items. I.e i know shotgun shells register as 35 on mine.

metaldetecting,2qgtly,metaldetectingstuff,3,Fri Dec 26 20:27:13 2014 UTC,"I forgot to mention... one of the biggest uses I'd have for a metal detector is panning the attic floor.  I believe there was a fire and the entire upstairs was gutted, leaving just an attic, but every square inch of floor space between the floor joists is loaded with odds and ends, pencils, crayons, toys, love letters, old B&W negatives, the aforementioned rose crystal, silverware, even playboy magazines.  Until this point I've been rummaging through it mostly to get the wiring redone, but I know I haven't really checked out 10% of what I've found, let alone the 75% of floor space I haven't looked into... I have buckets of stuff pulled up from under the insulation, and I have no idea what might be valuable."
metaldetecting,2qgtly,nathancard,3,Fri Dec 26 19:30:01 2014 UTC,"If your main purpose is the attic floor, something entry level will do. Stay away from the Radio Shack detectors and that sort of thing, most any retail detector for under $100 is too good to be true. Something decent ($200-300 dollar range) would probably be good. A lot of people like the Ace 250, but personally I would go with either a Fisher F2 or a Eurotek Pro (between the two, I'd pick the Eurotek Pro, and if you're looking for smaller targets like in your attic floor, I'd stick with the 8"" concentric coil, or maybe even get a 4"" sniper coil)."
metaldetecting,2qgtly,Swolebrah,3,Sat Dec 27 03:58:17 2014 UTC,I second the f2. It is a quality detector and easy to learn. As for more info about the land you should be able to google historical plat maps and then overlay them on google earth to get an idea of where things were at.

metaldetecting,2qcztg,Cahallfresh,2,Thu Dec 25 16:30:13 2014 UTC,"I'm in Germany as well. Some nice things to be found in the ground. You'll drown in Roman coins after a while.  Maybe a few tips for the start:   Get familiar with the laws in your state. It changes from area to area and in most cases they're a bit ambiguous, so know what you're doing. Best case scenario, you find someone detecting in your area who can tell you about it. Many times it really comes down to how open your local Denkmalschutzamt is. In most areas of Germany you will come across ammunition and even unexploded ordinance at some point. Again, know what you're doing and for god's sake don't try to move it. Honestly, you'll be fine most of the time, but there've been some people who were looking for old rifles and shit like that who were digging around old battlefields, which turned out to be not a good idea. Just in case, I've got the number for my local bomb disposal unit and a ground marker with me. Related to this: If you're anywhere near the old East German border, know the land. I'm living only a few kilometers from it. There are still some minefields around here. They're very well marked, but I wouldn't want to even get close to them. Best places to look: Old village public squares are great. Also, look for old bridges over shallow rivers. People, especially tradesmen, used to throw coins into the river for good luck. So right underneath old bridges you can find some good stuff. If you're seeing some easily visible landmark - old big trees standing alone and such - it's worth checking out. That's where people used to stash some goodies, which in my experience seems to have happened more often than I thought. A great time is late autumn when some of the smaller lakes where people go swimming get drained for the winter. You'll find quite a few people detecting the day after. Lost jewellery and coins everywhere."

metaldetecting,2q2q5l,usernameunavailable,24,Mon Dec 22 15:35:36 2014 UTC,"Not found by me unfortunately. This happened at the Weekend Wanderers Christmas rally yesterday. The finder was using a Deus and apparently it was a bit of an iffy signal that he was unsure whether to dig.    The finder dug down and found a lead lid and a few coins, once he realised what he had the FLO (Finds Liaison Officer) was called over and the area was cordoned off. The first coins out were identified as Cnut and Ethelread (the unready).  In total 5225 silver coins were recovered.   The value of the find is expected to be in the millions and there are so many coins that this may de-value some Saxon coins that are already around.  This could be the largest haul of Saxon coins ever found in the UK.  I will update with more pics as they surface."

If they do its a possibility to afford a Cnut at a reasonable price. I think even the possibility of them going on the market will have a negative pricing effect on Cnut and Ethelread coins out there already. Its amazing how much a discovery can effect pricing for a while. About 20 years ago I was involved with buying a bank roll of quarters that had a few missing which had been sitting in a bank box since the 30's. I sent them in to be graded and sold a few of the MS-65's and 64's. Two months later the mint state prices of that year fell 30%. It's since recovered but we are talking 20 years here.   Still want me a Cnut though."

I call my tools my own names, im no pro at this work.   Hole punch, backer, mark plate or that damn hunk of metal I use incorectly."
metaldetecting,2q3j5a,Twitch2469,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:58:12 2014 UTC,hmmm marking the leather with an x makes a lot of sense - didnt think of that. any idea when this would have been used? is this a modern day piece or much older? i'm still holding onto the idea that it's another colonial relic :-)
metaldetecting,2q3j5a,LeftyHyzer,1 point,Tue Dec 23 13:16:51 2014 UTC,"the tough part will come in the fact that Leather working was somewhat unchanged until modern machinery and even then hand made leather goods were prevalent. Its kind of like when i find Hem weights. They could be 1700s or 1920s. Either way cool relic and the fact that u can somewhat connect it with an old cellar hole makes it even more cool. Im sure a leather working historian would give you a bit closer date range, perhaps post on a leather subreddit or find a leather working forum to try out."
metaldetecting,2q3j5a,Twitch2469,1 point,Tue Dec 23 15:49:40 2014 UTC,"I doubt its modern as the tools of today are made with a higher quality of machining and materials. Items from the colonial era for the working man was made to work, just good enough.  A punch today looks more like a stapler. That looks to me like the lower end of a modern punch, where a hammer would then have had to drive the punch through. I'd bet this was needed for working something for cattle or horse leather items.  It's old to me cause it's, well. let's say less then ideal, a version 1 of the work process and a tool that was considerded disposable cause you would just end up rouining it so why shine and polish it. More modern items were built to last. Items you break, you make good for the moment."

metaldetecting,2pmyvf,TheLegacys,9,Thu Dec 18 01:41:11 2014 UTC,I would get the 250 because it has a lot better discrimination than the 150. Harbor freight has a cheap pinpointer for $15. I use it. It's kind of flimsy but it works pretty good.

metaldetecting,2pmyvf,urbanail1,2,Thu Dec 18 14:11:31 2014 UTC,ACE 150 doesn't have pinpoint. Go with the ACE 250 it's a better choice. There are good alternative pinpointers out there.
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,metaldetectingstuff,2,Thu Dec 18 15:50:41 2014 UTC,Thanks for all of the suggestions. I am really leaning toward the 250 now.

metaldetecting,2pmyvf,hollandsbrook,3,Fri Dec 19 16:25:58 2014 UTC,The ACE 250 doesnt have a built in pinpointer. It has a pinpointing mode  - very different things. I would actually go for the Fisher F2 which is a better machine anyway AND has a package that comes with a hand held pinpointer for only $215.   You can find it here: http://www.hollandsbrook.com/fisher-metal-detectors/fisher-f2/  Hope this helps!
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,nks12345,3,Thu Dec 18 12:04:53 2014 UTC,"Hey, if I may ask. What is the difference between a pinpointing mode and a pinpointer?"
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,hollandsbrook,2,Thu Dec 18 18:19:37 2014 UTC,a pinpoint mode is just another mode on the detector itself to narrow in on a target you've detected in other search modes.   a pinpointer is an entirely different device that's used to probe around in the hole you dig to find the target. here are some of the more popular pinpointers: http://www.hollandsbrook.com/pinpointers-probes  does that make sense?
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,nks12345,2,Thu Dec 18 18:28:08 2014 UTC,Yeah! I was thinking that on a metal detector such as the Ace 250 had a pinpoint mode and then there were higher end metal detectors that had something such as pinpoint built in as a feature on higher end models. Thanks!
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,hollandsbrook,2,Thu Dec 18 18:41:39 2014 UTC,here is a video about the garrett pro pointer which is by far the most popular: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-nd1iVV8rE
metaldetecting,2pmyvf,demux4555,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:29:17 2014 UTC,"I have to agree on this. F2 + handheld pinpointer seems like a really good way to start.  I got an F4 as my starter detector, but I didn't get a pinpointer. Even though the F4 has a very good and precise pinpointing mode, you're still gonna have to sift through huge amounts of dirt before you find the source of your beeps. It's literally  impossible to find small stuff when its got the same colour as the dirt itself.   I spent incredible amounts of time digging endless holes without finding anything. It was so fucking frustrating.   And then I got a pinpointer. It's like a whole new world. Now I spend like 20-30 seconds after digging a hole before I find the source of the beeps. Sometimes I just poke the thing into the hole, and you will immediately see what you're looking for without even sticking your hands down there.  So yeah, by all means, try to squeeze a handheld pinpointing probe into your starter kit. It will be so worth it."

I've also found a lot of workers tokens and foreign coins there. My theory is that this is where the workers got paid or camped out.

metaldetecting,2p7bk9,I_Protect_Mickey,2,Sat Dec 13 22:03:09 2014 UTC,Most shotguns are smooth bore and the grooves don't do very much as far as rifling. The grooves are mainly to allow the slugs to swedge through any normal size choke.

He cowered off and I felt bad afterward, but it's systemic.  For some reason, metal detecting for the greater population is just a scumbag way to try to profit from the suffering of others.

A church wanted everything (yes, everything) photographed, catalogued and appraised for value, anything > $10 we were to surrender.

A Bounty Hunter is a good investment for children or those considering getting into the hobby for the first time.  I scored a pretty insane deal awhile back, by finding a White's 5900di Pro for $150 that had been barely used by an older gentleman, in absolute pristine condition with all original paperwork.

metaldetecting,2onlwo,Cmabeng,2,Mon Dec 8 16:07:42 2014 UTC,"great gift!   in that range i would recommend either a fisher f2 or teknetics eurotek pro. the eurotek would likely suit you better since it's built to handle more mineralized soil than the F2. and since you are in oregon, this is a huge plus.  most all detectors have coils that are waterproof and fully submersible, however the control boxes are not. The AT PRO is an example of a fully submersible machine but that goes for $600.   the only accessory you REALLY need just starting out is a good pinpointer. I recommend the Garrett Pro Pointer.  other accessories you'll want to get down the road are headphones, a good digger, pouch and carry bag. but just starting out you probably have most of these in your garage.   also have you tried using our tool? http://www.hollandsbrook.com/metal-detector-selector  hope this helps! marc from hollandsbrook.com"

metaldetecting,2odfcl,AnonymousTurker,3,Fri Dec 5 16:23:14 2014 UTC,"The fields we use are on school grounds -- elementary and middle schools.  They are not really near the ""playground"" equipment areas but they certainly would be mixed use with little league baseball (outfield areas) and lacrosse.  I don't want to use stakes as anything above ground would be pulled, interfere with mowing and/or be an injury risk.  I worry that a stake below or level to the ground could pop up and there is potential for an injury or damage to a mower.  Eventually we might be able to use gps, but gps is not that precise yet.  I can be off a few inches but a couple of feet would be a problem as it would skew the field layout.  We are not talking world cup here, but we don't want the field to be noticeably off.  While there certainly would be other metal in the field I think we could offset that hazard as we basically know where and how the field is laid out, and where to expect to find the metal ""plants"".  So, for example, on an end line I am thinking we would ""mark"" the two corners, the point where the penalty area line meets the end line, the point where the keeper box meets the end line and the points where the goal posts would be located.  Once you found a corner and a couple of the points in the line it obviously would not be hard to know where to expect to find the others.  My main concern is that if you buried say a 2 inch steel washer would you get the same reading 18 inches away as you would if you were right over the washer?"
metaldetecting,2odfcl,JeffersonDavis,4,Fri Dec 5 19:19:52 2014 UTC,"Most detectors would be precise enough that you shouldn't get a signal 1.5 feet away.

The machine would have a pinpointer function putting you right on top of the washer you planted. If I was you I would even go a step further and put it inside a plastic bag with a quick note saying it's buried to help you with the field layout. This would help you in case someone with a detector decideds to go there with or without permission."
metaldetecting,2odfcl,dirtymoney,3,Fri Dec 5 20:32:50 2014 UTC,"This would work, the bigger and closer to the surface the metal is the better.  Also make sure you learn how to pinpoint with your detector which will reduce your level of error.  Someone mentioned 1.5 feet away as your range, it should be less than this, my basic (not cheapest) detector doesn't pick up anything unless its under the head and I can pinpoint things down to an inch or two with the right process."
metaldetecting,2odfcl,urbanail1,3,Fri Dec 5 20:23:16 2014 UTC,If you bury something small and metal like a washer... some metal detector guy will come along and dig it up.   Make it a long deep-reaching  metal stake and that would keep some guy from digging it up.

There are increasing restrictions on metal detecting, partly because of the mess others leave behind.   While you are on youtube, I suggest you watch some of the videos to get an idea of where people are using their metal detectors.   Where to detect requires a bit of detective work and planning, and depends entirely the area where you live. While you live in a suburban area, it probably had a history before it became businesses. So a visit to the local university looking at old maps could be very useful. Winter is a great time to be doing this so you are ready for spring. You might even wait to pull the trigger on a detector unless you find a great deal.  I encourage people to also keep perspective - I would like to note that there is not as much to find in the US as there is in Europe, as the US only has two-three hundred years of human habitation compared to Europe's millennia."

Knowing the machine (detector) and its learning curve is the hard part. I did 5~6months of very solid research watching and youtube videos until  I picked my ATpro. Take your time and decide what will,match your needs  Finding land to detect can be tricky. If you are in an urban area, parks and play grounds are good. Check municipal office (simple phone call) and fimd,out if there are rules against it. Next step (as others have mentioned) if find the old houses on the block or around town and Ask permission.   There is a bit of tact you must use when approaching strangers but the best is wear nice clothing, do not have your gear in hand, and make offers to clean up, or split finds or pay (10~20$/visit). I suggest holding,off on offering to pay as a last resort.....more so until you understand your detectors feedback and you learn what signals are junk.   Leave town and. Practice at a beach or open field (with permission of course). A few miles can be a huge difference. I live outside philly. Its amazing what 10 miles out side the city has to offer. 20 miles and you are (pretty much) in country.   Dont get discouraged. It takes a while to get used to the unit.

metaldetecting,2n1rr8,SaintAnthonysFire,1 point,Sat Nov 22 13:07:27 2014 UTC,"Reasons behind holed cents are plentiful in the numismatic community. One such tradition was to hole a copper and fashion it to a decorated necklace of colored strings or ribbons. You would then give a young lady this as a symbol of your intent. If the young lady had multiple suiters they would know who was in her thoughts by the string or ribbons color. This was normally a more southern tradition than northern, but during the civil war many opposed to slavery headed north to be with like minded individuals, bringing tradition with them.  This however, looks more like a button back to a large domed button or a tax token as others have suggested."

metaldetecting,2m6q6y,genericgeek,2,Thu Nov 13 15:26:03 2014 UTC,Youre likely doing nothing wrong. saltwater is a bit tricky and takes a while to get used to.  However if you look at the best water hunters they worry less about target identification and more about target recover.    the reason is simply because water is too tricky to surely i.d. anything. Lots of junk is typical and that fact that youre finding clad means youre doing something right.    Ive seen many water hunts where people show a nice gold ring surrounded by 10+ pounds of fishing weights and cans.    there is of course a chance that the beach youre at is detected out but if you are finding metal at all it seems clear the person before you didnt dig every signal

First time I took my gf MD-ing on the beach, a sad-looking lady came to me, saying that her husband (they were married 1 week before) had lost his platina wedding ring on the beach: they spend almost their entire honeymoon sieving the beach without finding it.   I was not very lucky that day, and my girlfriend became less enthousiastic with each bottle cap that I found. Hoping on some turn of events, I searched the part of the beach in which the ring could be found - only to find coin after coin (which made her happy, me somewhat eager and the lady desperate). After the sixth coin in 5 min, my DFX showed a (for me unkown) signal, and an huge platina wedding ring was found. Before I knew it, the German lady hugged me with tears and left me with €50 for diner with my girlfriend that evening.   I wasn't that lucky on further events, and my GF is not that enthousiastic anymore (sadly)."
metaldetecting,2lvto5,AlmightyRoerbakmix,4,Mon Nov 10 19:17:02 2014 UTC,Who needs a detector when you have two 3' tall treasure spotters.
metaldetecting,2lvto5,Wildkarrde_,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:29:33 2014 UTC,Destiny is funny.
metaldetecting,2lvwra,AlmightyRoerbakmix,5,Mon Nov 10 19:20:20 2014 UTC,"There's a simple explanation for this.  The fields you detect are those that surround metallic objects.  The fields that metallic objects produce are based on the size of the metallic objects.  When you detect a chain or other similar object, you are not detecting a thin, long piece of metal, you are actually detecting a number of very small objects that are losely attached to eachother.  The sputtering you see is caused by detecting a number of the small objects together.  The total size of the object is not the total size of the chain, it's the individual links.  Your detector does not see a mass of gold the size of the chain, it see's many multiple individual objects of small size together, and they all produce a field on their own that does not produce the same size field if they were the same amount of metal if they were melted together.  If you had a handful of gold dust buried 1 foot deep, and an equal amount of gold in nugget form buried 1 foot down, you would most likely never be able to locate the dust, but could detect that nugget even if it were reburied to 2 feet down.  In more simpler and shorter terms...the fields objects produce are not additive or multiplicative.  The only time when smaller objects may be more easily detected together, is if they have become melded together through natural process, such as in the ocean to form large concretions or rusted together (which gold does not do).  The large metal object many coins are stashed in is much easier to detect then the coin bundle on it's own."
metaldetecting,2lvwra,Abyss_Demon,1 point,Mon Nov 10 19:30:46 2014 UTC,Also each metal has different resonance from the signals being sent. Gold produces a similar signal to that of iron.

A minelab excal is also another very expensive model but they are top notch and usually in good shape used.  My best suggestion to you would be to get a nice less expensive model such as a tesero and work the towel lines and wet/dry sand to see how the salt buildup in your area effects detectors in general and whether your beaches are ""stocked"" up enough to afford a better machine in future gold finds. If you have a very rich undetected area an expensive detector could be seen as an investment rather than a purchase :P"

metaldetecting,2lba1e,eclectro,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:08:13 2014 UTC,"Prod rods are a good tool to have. but suggesting its not easy (with some practice) to dig holes in a park with no problems or messy plugs is silly in my opinion.    I have been digging exclusively (other than 1-2 times on family private property) for years in parks. The parks in my town are dated picnic areas to the 1880s, so i have no reason to visit other areas or go through the hassle of asking for private prop. permissions    It goes without saying discretion is key: dont dig messy holes, dont invade others space just because you think something might be buried right next to a couple having a picnic, take extra care in sensitive areas such as ball fields or around monuments, and most of all try to make sure with a good rain or two every single hole you dig can/will return to as you found it.    I refuse to believe however that city parks should be a no-fly zone to protect the hobby, just my opinion. Each detectorist needs to do a good amount of digging in non-sensitive areas to hone their technique and learn how they can best keep areas clean.  almost every town ive been to has a park with an ""athletic field"" which is basically a grass lot. Hit that and learn how to be clean then go to sensitive areas.  however every single person from the city who has ever inquired about what im doing or even just my finds has been shown be me some of the other holes ive dug to show im not destructive and also the massive bag of rusty trash and can slaw that is a potention health risk to those using the park. And each person in turn has expressed suprise at my cleanliness and the number of hazardous objects i remove from the ground of our parks here and has thanked me.  Last year my ""worst"" finds were a used needle, rusty scalpel, and a bent broken pair of scissors in sand!"
metaldetecting,2lba1e,eclectro,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:25:43 2014 UTC,"This really depends on the city/town/circumstance. It's an unfortunate fact that some people with authority (police/security/managers) will want to exercise that and either hassle or chase you away. You're fortunate to have found an area that is not sensitive and you would not be bothered and you're careful. But that is not the case everywhere, and the sad fact is that more regulations against the hobby are happening all the time."
metaldetecting,2lba1e,eclectro,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:34:12 2014 UTC,"I agree, first thing for anyone to do it check for specific ordinances in their area against metal detecting or the even more pesky wording of ""digging"". which in some cases the video you showed can be substituted to digging.    My goal is just to let people know that if you are acting within a certain range of the correct moral compass, you are cautious of doing any actual damage, and you promptly leave when asked to theres no reason to fear public official or cops.    From what ive seen alot of specific ordinances against metal detecting have been put into place because of someone as you said isnt careful, and more than likely made a mess that warranted a response from the city.  And i am in no way condoning ignoring ordinances or law breaking.    I try to throw at least a smile at everyone i see and show people my finds whenever they ask.

Normally silver will give a signal close to that.  Bigggest thing is to grid search the area and make sure you overlap each swing to cover every inch.  Go slow and steady, if you can get or have a pin pointer even better.  Dont waste time digging anything, mark it and come back later if you want to dig."

metaldetecting,2kfdy4,Cliintoris,1 point,Mon Oct 27 18:27:03 2014 UTC,"This is just my personal opinion after detecting for a long time. Access to all public sites is not sustainable esp. without some active intervention. The problem is that inexpensive machines are sold by the thousands/millions and everybody that gets one for Christmas heads to the local park.   Even though most instruction manuals have a 'code of ethics', it's simply inevitable that someone/beginner will go and make a mess. There was a video on youtube of someone hauling their shovels into a public park (I did let them know how wrong that was!). And even for those that are careful, they still massacre the plugs that they dig trying to find the target.  In this environment, I  simply do not escape more regulation. I'd love it if there was a way for self policing. But one rotten apple can bias a lot of people against the detectorist. I really think the answer lies in finding ways to move to private lands, like in England. We would find a lot more, anyway."

metaldetecting,2k0xjz,AlexMackAttack,8,Wed Oct 22 20:06:36 2014 UTC,"What you're describing is what is generally referred to as a 'broken signal'.  Anytime you come across a potential target, you are going to spend some amount of time on it before you make the decision of whether to dig and investigate further, or move on to the next signal.  Most detectors will produce only a few or just one tone, with varying characteristics based on the target it perceives.  The ones that don't have, or have less of the 'broken signal' type, are those that have multiple tones depending on the target, a very good example of this would be Minelab detectors, with, I think, up to 25 or so tones.  They're subtle differences, but after awhile you become familiar with the differences.  Now, back to yours.  Since your detector, like most, only uses 1 or 2 tones, it has to have a method for distinguishing targets out further, to give you a more specific idea of what that potential target may be.  An easy way of doing this is making the tone break up, chatter, or go blank in the middle, which generally indicates a ""poor target"" based on your detectors settings (ground balance, discrimination, etc).  Thet signal sounds 'broken up' because, from the detectors point of view, that target falls below what you have it set to look for.    That target giving the 'broken signal' could very well be a good target, if you do not have the detector set properly.  The detector will always assume you have it set exactly where you want it to be, and set perfectly to the ground conditions in your area.  If you don't, then you will likely find on occasion that you will be getting broken signals from good targets.  This is an indication that you are not properly tuning your detector for the area you are in, or for what you're ideally looking for.  Learning to properly set, and continuously adjust your detector while in the field will save you the absolute most hassle.    Another cause of 'broken' signals and false positive signals are ground mineralization pockets, hot rocks, or ""halos"" from heavily rusted iron/steel.  Ground mineralization is when you come across a small concentrated area of the ground, that is different from the surrounding ground, but moreso that the detector will see it as enough to signal the precense of a potential target.  Hot rocks are just as similar to ground mineralization, except rather then a pocket of dirt/clay, it's a rock, sometimes meteoritic/volcanic, but a heavily mineralized rock, enough the detector see's it as a metal object.  And the most common, imho, are iron/steel 'halos'.  A halo is when an iron/steel object has been sitting in the ground long enough, that through decomposition of the metal, it will seep and soak into the ground surrounding the object, creating a much larger object (in the eyes of the detector) and can skew the readings of the detector because the surrounding ground mixed with the decomposing iron/steel in the right conditions can make the detector think there 'might' be silver present.  The above is escpecially much more common in wet/temperate areas, such as the southern US states.  Where the weather is hotter/wetter iron/steel will decompose more rapidly and spread into the ground causing the halos.  You'll also see much higher mineralization in ground such as Georgia clays, for example.  If you're anywhere near mountains, you will deal with much more mineralization as you're dealing with crustal exposure protruding from deep beneath the Earth, from long long ago that can end up on top of the ground over time.  The most reliable way to cut down on ALOT of the phantom digging or false positive digging most beginners will see, is to get into the habit of using an X or cross pattern over the potential target.  Most false positives (especially halos) will always sound beautifully from one direction, but completely blank out or sound like total crap from the other direction.  Once you have a target located, take a little more time pinpointing and a few extra swings from left to right, then right to left, while paying very close attention to the signal differences, if there are any.  Once you've done that, rotate around the target by 90 degrees (now facing to the left or right, from where you first were) and repeat the left to right, and right to left sweeps, again looking for any odd signal discrepencies.  If you spend more time learning to properly tune your detector, and spend more time ""listening"" to what your detector is telling you when you do the very comprehensive sweeping once you've found a potential target, you will quickly learn the difference between a good signal and a bad/suspect signal.  if it's a good signal, 99% of the time, it will sound great from all 4 directions.  If it sounds great from 3/4, it's probably worth investigating.  If it's 2/4 or 1/4, it's obvious your odds are going down and you can see where this is going.  it doesn't hurt to dig up some of those 1/4 or 2/4 at times to see if you were right about it being a false positive either.  The more you dig, the more you can guess at what it is before digging, then later on you'll feel more confident about passing them up, saving yourself the time to dig those crappy ones up, and spend more time digging the goodies.  Goodluck!  Edit - Damn that was a long post....  Edit 2 - Without going back into a long rant, your needle is also a good indicator (if you have one) of potential suspect or good targets.  If it's very jumpy, or pins all the way to the right (silver dollar and up) then back down, then back up, I guarantee you it's an iron halo 99% of the time.  Good targets jump around much less, if at all, on needles/displays, same for their signal tone."

metaldetecting,2k0xjz,SaintAnthonysFire,6,Wed Oct 22 23:36:32 2014 UTC,"It could be multiple things. Falsing is one, it could also be a target masked by another piece of metal, or even a coin on edge. The more you go out, and the more you learn how your machine acts in different locations and situations, the better you will get at distinguishing between falsing and a good target. It really all comes down to practice. Some places I dig every target that even chirps the slightest, other places I only dig targets that hit consistent from multiple directions. In the end the only way to find out what something is, is to dig it. I don't think anyone can really pinpoint the exact reason your detector does this, because it could be multiple different things.  Try messing with the sensitivity and discrimination. Sometimes having the machine set to sensitive can make it false more often. Also discriminating too much or too little in a given area can also lead to falsing. I would suggest running your machine to only discriminate out iron.   Depth is a tricky thing. I have found coins from the 1700s less then two inches deep. At the same time I've also found modern clad at 10+ inches deep. After hunting a location for a while you usually get a pretty good idea of what depth certain aged items will be. This however is not always true and you could hit a nickel at 6 inches then find a 1800s silver not 10 feet away at half the depth."

metaldetecting,2jm97m,SiNNZack,6,Sat Oct 18 16:48:10 2014 UTC,It is awesome. Each time you dig you have literally no idea what you're going to find. Plus fresh air is goood. Can't go wrong with a Garrett Ace 150 to begin - it's cheap and works very well. I had one for 14 months and found lots. It was a good introduction. I've since upgraded to a Garrett AT Pro which is 5 times as expensive but you'll probably want something better after a while. Good luck.

You have to listen to the nuances of the audio tone. I had a Tesoro Silver uMax briefly that I had to sell to pay bills, and later bought a Ace 250. The uMax was actually so sensitive that I couldn't stop it from falsing near the water at the beach. I think having it first, and learning to ""read"" the signals, made me a better hunter with the Ace 250.  Most people go Garrett or Fisher for their first machine, instead of ""old school"" with a Tesoro. One nice thing about them is that they're built like a tank and have a lifetime warranty.

metaldetecting,2jkxte,mrhelton,2,Sat Oct 18 21:37:43 2014 UTC,"Bounty Hunter Junior. They actually work pretty well as a metal detector with some positives: recovery, discrimination, find small items, small coil to get in places, light, easy to use. However I don't like a few things about them: the cable runs through the shaft and you can't tell if it is twisted too much, the cam lock can split if tightened too much, the shaft would probably bend if a child puts too much pressure on it.  All up though, this cost me $50 new and it keeps them interested. Great family fun"

I had noticed various glass jars caught up in the roots of trees running along a creek bed. followed it up until I noticed some more of the glass. It was riddled throughout with lids and tops to misc jars so I brushed off the leaves and underneath was a large pile, 3ft x 4ft of glass bottles and jars.

In general, dry sandy soils with little salt content return excellent survey resolution, but heavy clay-based soils are difficult to penetrate with GPR. In some situations, penetration depth may be limited to a few feet or less within clays, whereas pipes residing in sandy soils could be detected at depths up to 30 feet."

Tesoro Compadre: cheap, light, solid, works extremely well, lifetime warranty, however no sensitivity adjustment so can chatter under power  lines or on difficult soil.  Ace 250 was one of my first detectors and I found some great items with it. I would recommend the Compadre over this though. Then there are the lower end Fisher and Teknetics detectors which are fairly good value.  Personally, I would go for the Compadre"
metaldetecting,2j82dp,abstractattack,7,Tue Oct 14 15:33:13 2014 UTC,"A few years ago I found something like this. I wasn't detecting, I was just walking through a field opposite where I lived - it was where the spoils of a graveyard were tipped - when I happened upon an odd looking rock in one of the mounds of soil... it just didn't really match the rocks around it - the outside was an earthy brown, but it was extremely uniform and round, covered in fractures with bits flaking off - like you'd imagine a dinosaur egg. It was fairly large, about three times the size of your fist. Being the inquisitive boy I was, I ever so gently brushed the hardened dirt off of it, dug around it with my finger then prised it out of the ground. I was struck by how heavy it was immediately - I knew it wasn't like any rock that I'd picked up before (and i had picked up a lot of rocks) it felt like solid metal. Without a second of hesitation, i hoisted it above my head and smashed it down on an even bigger rock with all my might. Should have seen my face when it exploded into about 100 cubic-shaped pieces - brilliantly shiny - like freshly polished silver but 10X brighter - that showered everywhere. I hurriedly picked up all the larger pieces that I could, putting them in a big pocket I made by pulling out the front of my jumper. Heart pounding, I rushed home fairly quick to show my mum my discovery. I had myself convinced that I'd found a meteorite - I knew they were heavy. Then, just like you, I switched to cannonball - no meteorite was ever that perfectly spherical. She was almost as surprised as I, and had no idea what it was. That week, I took it in to school to try to find out. It being a rock, I headed for geography. They were totally stumped, which made me partially disappointed but largely even more excited. So I took it to chemistry, just in case they could shed some light. The teacher didn't have a clue, but did a test on it which turned dark red, which apparently meant that it contained a lot of iron.   Then a few months passed by and I sort-of forgot about it. I found it again in a plastic bag in a drawer - it had become very tarnished, no longer anywhere near as shiny as when I had first smashed it. It resembled fools gold but was a dull grey and black rather than yellow. This rekindled my interest, and my mum suggested i take it to my local university. A few days later I did, and dropped it off in the geology department.   Months passed again. I forgot again. Then I received a small hand written note in the post from them. Turns out it was a form of iron oxide - rare to find such a large piece intact (tho it wasn't intact for long). I was sorta disappointed. It was iron oxide. rust. They offered to polish it for me - which I thought would be an awesome token - and I intended to reply... but I forgot... again.    Forgive me for not remembering the exact form - it's been quite a few years, and I'm sad to say i have lost the letter, because I remember the experience so vividly as a part of my childhood. A quick google came up with this page, and of those, it looked most like Hematite to me. But i suspect something along the lines of this is what you have found. If there's a geology subreddit (I just looked and of course there is) you should try posting it there and seeing if you can get any further.   I actually go to the university that i dropped it off at. In fact the building is no more than 10 minutes walk from here. You have rekindled my curiosity again - i'll try to get over in the morning and check if they still have it in some drawer somewhere... unlikely but worth a shot...   Thanks for reminding me, and for your time."

metaldetecting,2j1tig,bluelupus,2,Tue Oct 14 08:28:55 2014 UTC,Are you sure that ring was cheap? It kind of looks like a sterling silver ring inlaid with turquoise and coral.
metaldetecting,2j1tig,justtookatest,1 point,Tue Oct 14 08:45:13 2014 UTC,It doesn't have the standard markings in the band like the .925. I will probably take it to a jeweler or someone who knows more about this stuff when I get some time.
metaldetecting,2iyx5l,TexasSlowdown,3,Sat Oct 11 19:55:35 2014 UTC,"Great article! As massive as the Internet is, when it comes to the local history of small towns offline research can't be beat. I am a big fan of local historic societies. They are not only open, but extremely eager to teach people about local history. Even the smallest of towns usually have a group of people who get together and compile information about the town. I've found that memorial days are great events to attend to really learn about a certain town/place."

metaldetecting,2iwot9,Trees4twenty,1 point,Sat Oct 11 15:46:25 2014 UTC,"The nickel is 40% silver. During world war 2 they made a change to the composition of nickles and started using silver in them because other metals were needed for the war effort. That's where these silver nickels get the name ""war nickel"". You can tell a war nickel because it has a large mint mark above the monument on the back. Other nickels don't have the mint mark there."

The anticipation of one day finding the biggest treasure ever discovered.  Sometimes delaying social activity to get just that sliver of extra time in the field.  The very unique landowners you (sometimes) come across. Expertise in knowing the trash you find (because we find TONS of thrash).  Edit added: the boring research about buttons killed me.

metaldetecting,2ipt37,normallyimonimgur,3,Thu Oct 9 04:24:53 2014 UTC,I had a marble show up as silver one time. Not sure if its because some for of silver was used in coloring the marble or what.

metaldetecting,2igt08,edl88,3,Mon Oct 6 17:39:31 2014 UTC,"The Fisher F2, in my opinion, is a better machine than the BH4.  But if you're stuck with the option of buying a BH4 for yourself or sharing an F2 I would choose the BH4 simply for the fact that it is your machine and you alone are responsible for it.  As for the headphones I can't say with certainty but I would assume that they wouldn't be compatible.  But that is just an assumption."
metaldetecting,2igt08,bluelupus,2,Mon Oct 6 18:49:56 2014 UTC,Both those machines are made by the same company. They made the F2 to be better than the BH4 just like they made the Eurotek to be slightly better than the F2 for only a few bucks more.

metaldetecting,2igt08,SaintAnthonysFire,3,Mon Oct 6 19:07:57 2014 UTC,"Meh, accuracy really isn't a thing. Target separation is really what you pay for. The better the machine, the better it is at telling you what you're about to dig. It gets tricky when there are junk targets all around a good target or even on top of it.

That doesn't leave much time for extra opportunities to earn money in any capacity.  I will only have time to hunt the area max 3 days a week at 1-3 hours at the site.   I'm not young by any means but I am limited because we budget so tightly. Have a fam vacation coming up and already have a few savings accounts for large purchases that we have coming up. Those are not up for discussion.   Is the diff between the fisher and the BHT4 really that significant? 70 is much closer than 270.... I don't mind using something cheaper, ""scraping"" cash together while I'm using it and eventually stepping up to something nicer.   And that's not including the ""supplies"" and Garrett Pro Pointer that I've decided to get. If it saves time, imho it's worth investing in."

It's really a few steps below or right at the very beginning phase of the hobby.    Although a vintage piece may be worth a little to some collectors, I wouldn't fiddle with it unless you knew what you were doing, as it's likely much more valuable as a collectors piece then a functional piece.  And if you mess with it without knowing what you're doing, you could ruin that value, as far as a functional piece, it will have next to none compared to todays technology, although VLF technology hasn't changed drasticaly, there have been some improvements.  Edit - Yes, there are some collectors, and it's def worth more as a collectors piece then a functional one in the field.  Shop around, I picked up a brand new, in the box, min condition White's 5900Di Pro (the newer black box edition) for $150, which was a stel considering they go for $350 or more on eBay.  Off Craigslists of all places, just be very cautious of the scams that abound that place."
metaldetecting,2hufi1,Abyss_Demon,1 point,Tue Sep 30 01:15:30 2014 UTC,Maybe test it out and see if you can find anything. I know when I was a kid my grandpa had an old detector from the seventies and it didn't find much but I sure loved digging holes when it beeped. That's a good compromise because that way you might be able to gauge your son's interest level before spending more money.  I don't think there's much of a market for most vintage ones but you might be able to get a little bit out of it.

I figured the newer models had better tech, but also wanted to make sure this wasn't some old ""built like a tank"" version that's still useful.

And I like my big army knife for digging holes, although I need to get leather gloves cause I with that knife, I have to scoop the dirt out with my hand. My mini garden shovel just does just ok. So not sure what you plan on digging with, but a good tool is important. I've broken a couple of regular knives. Oh and headphones! Depends on where you're hunting but I like to use them to conserve battery. Try not to scratch your finds when digging them up! To give you a realistic idea of what you'll be digging up... In the past two to three months I dug up a LOT of trash, approx $9 in regular change, lots of random stuff including a toy soldier, old lock, butterfly pendant, 18 wheat pennies, three foreign coins, one silver dime, a silver naked lady ring, and a 14k gold ring. So not much valuable stuff out of all those holes I dug, but the gold ring itself should be about $100-150. I use a rock tumbler to get my modern coins clean of dirt. I finally found a toy gun recently too but it's pretty rusty so I'm going to try electrolysis soon. You need a car battery charger, plastic tub, and baking soda for that.

I've already got a battery charger for my trolling motor that I'm going to modify.

metaldetecting,2gu3vd,mrhelton,3,Fri Sep 19 16:47:01 2014 UTC,"The pin pointing feature on the detector is very handy to zero in on your target (although it's still no replacement for a handheld pinpointer like a ProPointer). The detector has a couple of different Std/Pro Coin/None discrimination modes.  The Std modes are for beginners, so I went right to Pro. Initially, I used Pro/Coin mode to discriminate out iron and junk.  After a while, I settled on Pro/None mode (basically no discrimination) and use the VDI number and judgment of the location to decide whether I want to dig a signal or not. IMHO, Pro/None gives you the best depth and the best ""picture"" of what's in the ground. Read the manual and learn how to ground balance the machine. It can help if you find yourself detecting a spot with unusual mineral composition. The 5x8 coil is great for trashy areas and for detecting in tall grass and woods. Get coil covers.  They might seem silly, but they're cheap insurance. You'll hit a lot of rocks, tree trunks and debris while swinging, and the covers will save wear and tear on your coil.   The AT Pro is a great machine - IMHO, by far the best machine in its price range - I've been very happy with mine. Good luck!"

metaldetecting,2gu3vd,mrhelton,3,Fri Sep 19 20:35:14 2014 UTC,"I read the posts so far and have this in addition   Sometimes the AT Pro will average targets if they are super close to - eachother, giving it a number lower or higher than you're used to. If you're willing, digging all repeating tones will give you a lot of great finds you might otherwise have missed.  Use Pro mode and turn on iron audio if you want to find things between all the nails. Pro-zero mode with iron audio off (it's backward) will give you slightly more depth and will let you find targets that are closer to nails.  Hit those super trashy areas in the old parks with the 5x8 coil nice and slow. I've pulled out a ton of great things at my park that I wasn't able to with 2 other detectors, and there's a lot of competition. This seems to be one of the better machines for picking through trashy areas."

Although any window with this style of glazing is technically ""a sash"", the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically, or horizontally in a style known as a ""Yorkshire light"", sliding sash, or sash and case (so called because the weights are concealed in a box case). The oldest surviving examples of sash windows were installed in England in the 1670s, for example at Ham House.   The invention of the sash window is sometimes credited, without conclusive evidence, to Robert Hooke.

metaldetecting,2glmbd,Abyss_Demon,1 point,Thu Sep 18 12:11:37 2014 UTC,"That's just the thing, I would have assumed iron, steel, or lead, given the time period those materials were commonly used in almost everything.  For these to not be magnetic really makes me question if they could have been those types of weights.  We simply didn't use many things outside of iron/steel/lead in everyday things during that time period, so that is a curious thing.  I wonder if they could have been billets of materials used by a blacksmith/forger.  Perhaps they could be billets of carbon used in the forging of steel/iron during the 19-20th century, and were dropped while traveling, or perhaps there was a forge/smelter in the area.  If you're still unable to come to a conclusion on what these could be, I would suggest taking them to your local college and speaking to someone in either the history department, or the chemistry department.  The first may recognize the shape/weight and it's use, the second could verify what the material is just based on it's weight/volume, from there you could speculate on it's use.  Keep me updated, I find it's the little things like this we find, that can tell a much greater story about what happened in the past than coins and valuables.  EDIT- Went back through the thread after responding, looks like I was right about the carbon rod hypothosis, either for forging or from batteries.  My first assumption would have been the weights but if they're not magnetic...yeah, def either for forging or from old batteries.  =)"

Both homes I have hit with 3-4 different machines. Also have hit them a combined 30 times. All of these finds rang up 100% crystal clear. It was like how did I ever miss them!   The Indians are 1906 and 1880, the Merc is 1919 and the walking liberty is 1943. The wheats range between 1913-1947. I have no clue what that bull ring is, or the possible age. Regardless I'm in love with this news coil. I'm glad I went with the coiltek 6"" treasure seeker, it has really opened up a  whole new underground world!

First the surface area is smaller so when you hit an area that is very trash dense you get less objects under the coil. It also seems to be much more sensitive to small objects near the surface. Hell, tonight I found a small earring and then l10 feet later found it's backing. I really have no clue why this is the case tho. The downside to smaller size it less depth. This can be a double edged sword. You can't hit as deep with a small coil but you can also get a lot closer to metal objects without them interfering, like playground equipment."

metaldetecting,2g1ent,OMGWTF-BOB,1 point,Thu Sep 11 20:51:03 2014 UTC,Was what I was going to ask ;) stop stalking me Trog.....  Depending on what state and what beach you can have some issues. Florida is pretty much ok except some areas of PC. Alabama is ok as well. Mississippi gets murky as well as Louisiana. Especially after Katrina a few areas made some changes to where you can or can't detect. Most are very well marked though.  Get a cover or use a bag on your head just in case you get some mist or spray. Every time I hit the beach I swear the saltwater always finds a way to the batteries on my 250.
metaldetecting,2g1ent,TrogdorLLC,2,Thu Sep 11 03:44:26 2014 UTC,"stop stalking me Trog..... ha!    I got one of those little black covers for the head of my 250 when I bought the Spring Sale pack. I also bought coil protectors for both coils that came with it.   I'm going to try and finally get to Clearwater Beach this weekend, and hope the thunderstorms don't chase me off for the 5th week in a row.  PS to Bob: Did you know that there are 51 varieties to the 1862 silver Victoria rupee? I had to research it at work. Unfortunately, the one we got in wasn't a $1700 one, just a common variety..."

I plan on doing a bit of detecting if the weather permits.   51 varieties to the 1862 silver Victoria rupee   Good grief! No I didn't... Is it ""drastic"" variety changes or like VAM's?"

After years of it getting vandalized during spring break we sold out to some condo developers. Then sold some rural property in Gainesville and got the Cocoa property. It beats PC, Jax, St. Aug and everywhere else we lived in Florida.  Usually very peaceful and the beachfront is well patrolled and clean. No big eye sores and blight just beautiful beach and ocean.

As you can see, even a few coins are buried randomly in this list, the good stuff just isn't at one end of the chart, so it's better to dig everything until you get a better idea of how your detector works.   I have the Garret Ace 350 (Double D coil) and when I find a coin, it doesn't just ""beep"", it ""pings"" like a bell, and has a reliable signal. Other strong persistent ""beeps"" are probably steel."

After doing more research about the location I decided against taking it with. The neighborhood was sketchy, putting in the boat was sketchy, the ride was sketchy and so was the island. Fortunately we had a lot of success just by scouring the shore line.   All of the bottles and relics were found within 5 feet of shore. The age of all of the stuff ranges from 1880s-1930s. Some of the bottles including the gallon sized bear springs bottle were floating on the surface. It was really amazing the shear volume of old glass bottles on this island. I would have to say thousands and thousands.   If anyone has any questions about any of the relics let me know, and I'll try and share some history I found on them."

Two of the guys who came are naval officers(Chilean/US) who are shipping out in a week. We probably won't be able to do another adventure like this for 4-6 years.

In a wet soil like a beach or river bank a gold coin will keep sinking through the mud/sand till it hits clay or rock. Some of these could easily be deeper than hobby metal detector range by the time they started hunting."

metaldetecting,2ev3ds,mamlambo,2,Fri Aug 29 00:35:34 2014 UTC,Nice finds! What detector were you using? Your junk pile isn't very big compared to your finds.
metaldetecting,2ev3ds,yyy,3,Sun Aug 31 09:41:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks! My detector is a White's MXT E-series with the standard Eclipse 950 coil.  The size of my junk pile really comes down to two things.  #1 and most importantly it comes down to people respecting the beaches along Lake Michigan, especially at the park I was at. I usually bring a milk jug that I've cut the top off to use as a trash collector and I rarely even cover the bottom with trash. #2 comes down to knowing what certain trash sounds like when the detector hits it.  Pull tabs have a very distinctive signal (They almost always hit at +18 on the VDI scale) and have a distinctive ""double hit""  in that you will have a strong hit followed immediately by a weak hit,  which to me is very distinctive to pull tabs due to their double loop.  Hope that answers your question!"
