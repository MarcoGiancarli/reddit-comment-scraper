vita,3e24zx,halokilla77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:00 2015 UTC,"Because Polyphony Digital is owned by Sony.   Edit: I didn't see the word like after Gran Turismo.

vita,3e2pln,ThisUsernameIsMyName,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"Sony makes great products - there is absolutely no denying that.  The problem is their marketing and support teams.  They seem to be willing to coast on name recognition alone and that doesn't work with something like a gaming console because, unlike their other hardware (tvs, stereos, laptops, etc) it takes additional input (games) to be successful.  When you're not solely responsible for the development of games on the platform, you need to give those other companies some reassurance that their investment is well placed.  THAT is where Sony failed with the Vita.    Devs haven't had the reassurance they need to put significant assets into the Vita.  They need to see advertisements, printed and visual, to know that their own investments will have every chance to be successful.  Sony doesn't do that.    They could have advertised it better, bundled it with PS4's or even PS3's, or other things to try and promote the Vita, but they didn't.  They didn't even show it at the past 2 E3 conventions.    It isn't that Sony's abandoned it or that the Vita has ""failed"" - it's that Sony refuses to give the Vita a further push to get it over the hump, so to speak.  It's indeed a niche system, but it is absolutely dominant and excels above any other console platform in that niche.  Of course, I'm referring to the RPG/indie genres of games.    The fact that it's not region locked and that the major JRPG companies - Atlus, IF, XSeed, NIS, others - have shown full faith in the console show that it's a very solid platform for what it does.  That, and having indies released on a pretty regular schedule means that the Vita isn't going anywhere any time soon, but you also have to be very realistic in what the Vita is, and will be.  And that's a very powerful console that has a huge library of RPGs and indie games.     Is it worth it to try and contact them with an overly passionate message?     Yes.  Just because Sony isn't willing to do anything to push support on their console now doesn't mean they won't if they hear a large enough cry for it.  Never think your voice and opinion isn't valuable."
vita,3e2pln,ishkabibbel2000,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"I love Sony. They invest is some excellent studios and allow people to create amazing games like Journey, Last of Us, and so on. They make great consoles and have some excellent people like Shu, Adam Boyes, etc working there.   I think the Vita got hit with a few things. It came out in a market where everyone has smartphones. The 3DS was able to combat this with its easily portable clamshell design, and having major franchises that appeal to mainstream audiences. Games like Animal Crossing and Pokemon. I mean people I know who don't play console games will buy a 3DS just to play AC. The vita has an amazing catalogue of games, one of my favorite. However, it lacks any games like those that massively appeal to those broad audiences.   Another issue I think hurt Vita was its marketing. Sony has finally gotten their shit right with the PS4. They've learned how to speak to the market in a way to sell their products. Before however, they weren't very good at all. So we saw, or didn't see, a lot of blunder with advertising the Vita.   The way I see it now the Vita is a great platform to own and buy now. It has an amazing library of native Vita games, a decent amount of PSP and PS1 games, Remote Play, indies galore, and pretty awesome Japanese support.  I also think for all the hate Sony get's they do try hard to support a handheld that has little hope of creating a return on games they put out. They are the reason we get so many indies thanks to their excellent 3Rd party staff and support. They helped get games like Grim Fandango on Vita. Hell they even pay for new IP's like HELLDIVERS to come to Vita. VIta will continue to see support like this. Sony may not have AAA games in the works, but they sure do have smaller Helldivers size games that will be cross-buy with PS4/Vita. We just won't see them at E3 because these types of events are to get the media talking about their big hitter; PS4.  Expect to see Vita love at PS experience. A place where they know the majority of the audience wants vita games.   Viva La Vita!"

No firm price yet, I've been operating under the assumption that it'll roughly maintain the cost difference between the original and WotL, no real reason for that other than it's the only speculation point we really have. If it does, full price for the original was 4.99, WotL is 2.99, so if it maintains that ~3/5 price ratio, Rebirth is 14.99, so Afterbirth could reasonably be ~9. it could of course be any other price as well, but you know, convenient speculation"

Disgaea's mechanic has pretty much been static since the first game and 3 is fantastic even though it's the older of the two.  The main difference is going to be the story, and they are well written and entertaining that it's worth reading either way.  Besides, it's cheaper :P  PS: the devs does a very good job localizing the game for US, don't worry about it being crappy."

vita,3e1119,ghos7bear,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:41 2015 UTC,I'll argue price. 3 can usually be gotten much cheaper than 4.  On the upside the DLC on 4 alone is worth the price.

vita,3e1119,nomtank,4,Tue Jul 21 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Have you gotten through the tutorial? If not I really recommend doing so, even if you just go back to refresh your memory, it would help.  The hub world has everything you need, stores, healer that heals everyone for a price (you don't recover on coming back, you have to go through the healer), item world, the portal that leads you through the story, and the council, in this class, the class council, where you can use points to make extra players, make the game harder or easier, or upgrade the stores, and other random things.  The combat is like most strategy RPG, you move your unit, and you can select attack or use specials, or just lift something around you up, do note that friendly fire happens.  Once you made the choice, the character will have an ""A"" above his head, to actually make them do the attack you need to press triangle and ""execute""  And after all that... There's a lot more to go from here... Classes, weapons, skills and upgrading them, class seats, mentors, blocks and color tiles... Etc.   I suggest going slow at it, this is a long game, I can tell you that but rushing through it didn't help me when I was in disgaea 2 so I assume the same for 3"

Don't really like that game personally).  Any roguelike game would probably fit your fancy as well. I would personally recommend The Binding of Isaac with Rogue Legacy behind.  Not sure what good rhythm games there are for the Vita that are 'readable'. I'd go with Luminies at the moment.  Geometry Wars 3 is out for the vita and that game is pretty damn fun. I haven't tried it, but I have played the first and second game.  I'd also suggest the Metal Gear collection on the Vita."

vita,3dyet1,Nlopez108,5,Mon Jul 20 19:59:03 2015 UTC,Well. Everyone should look up Greg's article in the magazine. Although I still prefer triple a games as vita exclusive.
vita,3dyet1,hhhhojeihsu,0,Mon Jul 20 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"I came here to say the same thing! Except that I'm totally with him regarding preferring indie/original games rather than AAA titles that will always look and play better where they were originally conceived to be played (on the couch in a big screen).   That's not saying that one way is better than another -  it really depends on the type of game. 3DS is much more successful (critically and commercially) than the Wii U, and it's a ""weaker"" machine. I believe every game has a homeplace, a machine where it will be better suited. For instance:   Uncharted - best on home console Shovel Knight - best on handheld console Diablo - best on PC Plants vs Zombies - best on tablet Candy Crush - best on smartphone   I always say this: there's a reason Nintendo does Pokémon only on portables. I think the Vita is becoming more aware of this perspective and it will pay off in the long run."
vita,3dyet1,oldmess,3,Tue Jul 21 00:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Indie fits vita well. But that draw all the attention, which make Sony keep ignoring it. I admit vita has many great games, but we shouldn't keep telling ourselves. "" vita has a lot of games, none of them understand that."" One of the biggest reason is the lack of aaa titles. People who doesn't own a vita will be like "" I can play those games on multi platform, why should I get a vita."" Vita does a good job, but it deserve more."
vita,3dyet1,hhhhojeihsu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:05 2015 UTC,"I actually can't stand the click-to-move controls of Diablo on the PC and if it wasn't for the PS4 version I would never have played it, I also prefered PvZ on the DS as the stylus adds better control for dropping plants etc.  Oh and Uncharted Vita was just like playing on the home console versions to me, but I get your point."

Even ignoring the missing epilogue campaign, the lack of 3D city exploration alone is a deal breaker for me. And that's just one of the many compromises P3P makes on presentation.   Hell, even the devs have said they weren't happy with the compromises they had to make to get the game running on the PSP's shitty hardware. A Vita port of FES with all the improvements and extras from P3P would pretty much be the definitive version of the game. Until that happens, I'll just stick with the PS2 version of FES."

vita,3e1b1r,Celda,6,Tue Jul 21 04:50:00 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of visual novels--from any company--have not been officially localized. For otome titles, the PSP (and by extension, the Vita via PSN digital store), there is Sweet Fuse and Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom. I have not played Hakuoki myself yet, but it is romance and adventure in the samurai era, from what I understand. (Note that there is also an action spinoff game called Hakuoki: Warriors of the Shinsengumi.)  The Vita will be getting three otome games in English in the next few months:   Amnesia: Memories (some time in August, digital-only, also on Steam) -- about a girl with amnesia and the unusual boys she works with at a cafe Norn9: Var Commons (November 10, physical and digital) -- about 3 girls and 6 boys who are espers on a giant aircraft, mystery involved Code: Realize Guardian of Rebirth (November 24, physical and digital) -- steampunk era story with five reimagined European literary figures   If you need something now and are okay with it being... different... there's Hatoful Boyfriend which just released. It is the visual novel where the boys are pidgeons.  If you're ever up for horror stories, I will strongly recommend Corpse Party (PSP download). It has a visual novel sequel, and will be getting a third game (for Vita specifically) October 13th. (I'm a fan of horror, so I really like this franchise.)  You mentioned liking Dangan Ronpa. Be aware that there is a sequel that you will both definitely want to play (if you haven't already), as well as an action spin-off that will release September 1st. You may also be interested in the Zero Escape series. The first game is 999: Nine Hours, Nine People, Nine Doors (for the Nintendo DS), and the second game is Virtue's Last Reward (for the Vita and 3DS). A third title has recently been announced for Vita and 3DS, and will probably release next year I imagine.  I will lastly recommend looking into Steins;Gate. It is out for Europe right now, and will have an American release August 31st. It's a very well-regarded time travel-themed visual novel."
vita,3e1b1r,Reset_Tears,2,Tue Jul 21 06:23:11 2015 UTC,"I did played Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom and it was very long reading. Compared to Sweet Fuse, Hakuoki is longer and has more interesting group of men. I feel that the reason you liked Sweet Fuse  is due to its theme and gameplay which Hakuoki does not possess. Sweet Fuse is set in an amusement park created by the Megaman creator while Hakuoki is set in the Kyoto towards the end of the Edo period, so there's lots of battles, katanas and samurai principles in Hakuoki. Also, Hakuoki, unlike Sweet Fuse, has good endings and bad endings with CGs. Yes, there's much more pictures to see in Hakuoki than there is for Sweet Fuse which made me a bit sad back when I first finished it, since once you finished it, there's really nothing to go back. Though on the bright side, each of them have amazing soundtracks. Amazing voice actors too, I heard the lead character in Hakuoki, Hijikata-sama, is voiced by the one who provided Sasuke's.  Hakuoki is available for the PSP, 3DS, PS3, Android and iOS. Has Anime series and movie, and stage play!  I would also recommend what Reset Tears said, the one game amongst the three I'm definitely playing first would be Norn9: Var Commons!"

Haven't had a chance to pick it up because it can be a little expensive and rare for some versions of the game (Physical 3ds version can be around $50+, Limited edition 3ds can be $80+, but the PS3, 3DS Eshop, and PSP versions can be seen at a MUCH cheaper price than $50). PSP, PS3 and the 3DS versions are the same game but they have different bonus content and unlockables. For example, the 3ds one has a photobooth bonus content where you can snap pictures and add frames with the characters in the game on the photo.  Just to let you know: There is 2 games on the PSP, one is a spin-off (Hakuoki: Warriors of the Shinsengumi) and one is the psp port (Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom)"

The heroine isn't as assertive as the one in Sweet Fuse, but I enjoyed it anyway.  I really liked the historical information and the odd (sometimes predictable) turns in the story. If she liked Sweet Fuse, she should definitely try this.   Also, she may want to check out Hatoful Boyfriend. It's a bizarre but fun take on dating sims and visual novels."
vita,3e1b1r,Saibanchou,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:27:40 2015 UTC,"Otome-wise she should definitely look into the three upcoming Vita releases which Reset Tears already mentioned.   If she's patient, you could also wait for the Hakuoki remake on Vita (even more content than the previous versions). It's out for September in Japan and hasn't been confirmed for localization yet, but the chances for that are definitely good."
vita,3e1e9r,terrydragon2,7,Tue Jul 21 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"Because it was glitchy as hell. I probably bitched about it more than anyone else on this sub. Here is a review I did when it first came out.  But take it with a grain of salt. I'm not like a game developer or anything like that. From what I can recall...   I wound up having to beat the game multiple times because of a glitch that wiped out the game save or something.  The battle mechanics were really awkward and sometimes outright horrible. When it worked right it was pretty cool though.    I'd like to say that they fixed a lot of the issues by now, but hell.. I tried playing a game of LBP and it's still laggy as hell so I doubt they fixed the game with the exception of the glitch that made you have to restart the game.   But consider this... if we didn't have a good reason to bitch about it why did they end up selling it for a $1 later on with AC3 for PS3? I wound up selling my original copy and just paying a $1 more to get the PS vita version cause I hoped that they might fix it, cause it really did have potential."
vita,3e1e9r,l0stinthought,2,Tue Jul 21 06:20:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. Yours was actually in depth and explained the problem. Looks like I'll only be getting it if it's on sale.
vita,3e1e9r,l0stinthought,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"checkout ebay or even a gameswapping subreddit on here. i'm sure there has to be more a few people trying to get rid of theirs.   It really is a shame because the game was fun, just extremely disappointing at times. The fact that I (and others) beat the game over and over again is sort of a testament to that."
vita,3e1e9r,JrpgGamer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"I had to start over a couple of times because I would get stuck on the loading screen. Is that the glitch that you are referring to?  I haven't played any of the AC games, but I thought the game was decent."
vita,3e1e9r,l0stinthought,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:25:51 2015 UTC,Yea I think so. The most frustrating thing about the game was how close it was to being a great game. Like I said before I even bought it again when they were offering it for $1 with the purchase of AC3 for PS3 in hopes that they would eventually fix it.
vita,3e1e9r,osvico,5,Tue Jul 21 12:06:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not especially familiar with other Assassin's Creed games, but I got the bundle when it first came out. I think the gameplay is decent, the graphics are good (bad animation though), but the story is bland and the gameplay doesn't hold up for long.   As far as the gameplay, you get into a rhythm of killing, sneaking, stealing, and syncing. The outfit switching is too obtuse and only rarely ever serves a purpose. The combat isn't especially good. One major pain point are the near broken mini games that make use of the Vita's camera, accelerometers, and touchscreens. I read about people having issues with them, but I didn't have any until I got to this marble game that required tilting the vita to get it into a whole. It was next to impossible to control the marble and I stopped playing the game for a few months as a result. There are occasional framerate issues, but nothing that inhibits gameplay.   Overall, if you're not paying more than $15 and aren't strapped for cash, I think it's worth your money. If you are low on money, I would say look at other games first."

The game is an in universe release, rather than being the person diving in to the unedited memories it's one the in universe company has already sanitized to a degree, hence the things like the hacking and ""showing you the truth"" parts. While it may well have been completely unintentional and actually just bland story writing I kind of like it for that"
vita,3e1e9r,osvico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:50:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose the story isn't all that bad, and maybe it's the overall presentation that is bland to me. I remember the music setting a somber tone throughout the game, but overall it wasn't very memorable. Compare this to something like Gravity Rush, which has such a good presentation that I overlooked its technical issues and repetitive gameplay."
vita,3e1e9r,ambassador_of_porn,3,Tue Jul 21 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"Terrible performance, bad graphics (upscaled resolution is quite visible) and tons of glitches can ruin even a game that is very good otherwise. And Liberation is not ""very good"". If you are that interested in Aveline's story, you can get it on PC or consoles and have a better experience."
vita,3e1e9r,C4L_R3VOLUTION,2,Tue Jul 21 08:21:06 2015 UTC,"Ah, see, it's not that I give a damn about the story. I don't think I really cared about any AC story except the first one.   This is more because I'd like a good open world, free roaming experience such as AC or GTA on my Vita, which is frustrating, when there are quite a few out there for Android and iOS."
vita,3e1e9r,exsinner,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"I was actually fairly impressed by what they were able to achieve on the platform.  Just imagine AC3, but worse in every way.  Poor frame rate hurts a game like AC because it ruins that feeling of being sneaky and nimble.  It got a 70 on Metacritic which I think is a pretty fair score if you can pick it up for cheap.  I think a fan of the series could enjoy it but there are definitely better games on the vita.  I always hoped for a sequel that would iron out some of the performance issues.  I think many fans are frustrated because this game could have been great instead of just passable."

I personally see it as a better title than AC3 due to actually dwelling towards slavery during the colonization of America. Besides the point the game plays amazing on the PS3, I've yet to have played it on the Vita, but I've heard of online & additional content on that version. Besides the point, the cosplay gimmick that is introduced here is very situational & you'll likely stick with the assassin uniform & the slave costume, meanwhile the Lady dress limits your movements & is purely situational.   The story is adequate at best, but it has some interesting character development & curveballs thrown all around.   Get this game on the Vita, if you're interested for more western games on the system. There's the PS3 version available, but cuts down some gameplay gimmicks & the online aspect."
vita,3e1e9r,devensega,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:59:55 2015 UTC,"There is online, but it isn't any kind of traditional online you might see in the series, it's basically a boardgame where you try to control a certain number of points on the map, once enough are captured or a week passes real time a session ends. When you exit the game you provide a bit of extra defence to whatever node you decided to quit at making it harder for the opposing team to take over. Apparently you can get powerups for it sometimes from pickpocketing"

vita,3dz5zo,Halfmetal,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:32 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume that the resolution of the games make it look horrible on console?
vita,3dz5zo,Openworldgamer47,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, all the Vita games I have look gorgeous. I was pleasantly surprised with how good they looked."
vita,3dz5zo,Halfmetal,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. Interesting, I'll see about getting one soon."
vita,3dz5zo,Openworldgamer47,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:16 2015 UTC,For me it was just a cheap alternative to enjoy some Vita games. If you already have a Vita the only real reason to get one would be to play games on the big screen!  Still 40 dollars isn't a bad price for something like that.
vita,3dz5zo,Halfmetal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Just bought one for 40€. I finally wanted to play TxK on a bigscreen. Unfortunately some games I like to play don't work (e.g. Wipeout 2048). I was pleasantly surprised how good the games look. The upscaling routine the PS TV makes it look very clean and sharp.
vita,3dz5zo,Chris23235,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love it! Some of the games almost feel comparable to early PS3 titles. I don't actually own a Vita and it was a cheap way for me to enjoy some of the games.   I also like to enjoy playing games with someone else (Trading off) so the PSTV really fit what I needed."
vita,3dz5zo,Halfmetal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:15 2015 UTC,"I got the bundle at walmart that comes with 8 gb memory card, ds3 controller, and two games for $50.

vita,3e0x3i,tgodfather,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"Both of the Vitas you linked are the new 2000 models according to the product description, however they're each sold by a different store so that's probably the cause of the price difference."
vita,3e0x3i,feladirr,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"Buy the bundle you get more bang for your buck, you get a 8gb memory card, and the game with all dlc, if you buy the standalone ver you have to get an overpriced mmc and games."
vita,3e0x3i,shadowharold,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:39 2015 UTC,"Well if you go physical only you probably wouldn't have to buy a memory card since the slim has a little built in storage, but yeah if you're going to have any digital downloads at all (including patches or DLC) you'll probably want a card"

vita,3dya21,LoSouLibra,7,Mon Jul 20 20:55:52 2015 UTC,It will happen eventually. Every other of their games is on all three modern PS systems. The only one missing is Journey on Vita
vita,3dya21,Xephon7,3,Mon Jul 20 15:22:55 2015 UTC,It would be such a relaxing game to play in or before bed.
vita,3dya21,SpaghettiBounce,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"Hell Yeah! The last thing I heard about this was that somebody thought that the Journey needed a big screen and that they therefore hadn't ported it. But that sounds like a bad argument to me, I would love to replay it on vita."
vita,3dya21,jamesjoyce1882,9,Mon Jul 20 15:59:22 2015 UTC,"honestly you should play it on a big screen, the games more of an experience than a game, experience it the way it's meant to be taken in. Plus you need internet for the full experience"

vita,3dya21,jnmaniac,3,Mon Jul 20 14:59:35 2015 UTC,I asked That Game Company on the Facebook page the other day and they basically said - its Sony that's in charge of the IP - so they didn't know anything about a Vita port. Though some news outlets had believed it was happening and mentioned it when on about the PS4 version - but could've been a guess. No real evidence.   I'd rather play it on Vita.

vita,3dya21,LemonLimeAlltheTime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:45 2015 UTC,Well TGC is independent now and working on a new IP so I wouldn't expect a Journey port unless SSM does it themselves.

Sony does know that a lot of people want a PS Vita port. We can’t make any comments other than those.     TGC wants it to happen, but as the project would take more resources than two unpaid interns, Sony probably isn't interested."

In my mind, Journey is such a grand spectacle of a game that it needs to be played on a large, beautiful screen with good audio (damn that soundtrack) rather than something like the Vita where it wouldn't feel as immersive."

They are only making enough LEs for the people that preordered for one. I think this has to do with a few of the items in the LE are very limited: like the Vita pouch, the NA exclusive teddie keychain, and P4D skin. Most of the items in the localize LE are not even available in japan so Atlus USA has to make orders for them. Glad i preordered mine early.  Edit: if you preorder one, then you have nothing to worry about just make sure you pick it up day one on release. Atlus said they are making extras just in case but not many"

vita,3dzte5,Billybobbean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:11:42 2015 UTC,"Amazon US won't send a lot of things to the UK, that's what I meant by IF you can get them to deliver. It's a shame because they have really good prices on many of the U.S. exclusive physical releases.  Also for a cheap item like this you won't get hit with any charges."

The last number for Sony products only marks the region. Look up Vita slim or Vita 2000 and I'm sure your results will widen.    A quick search brings up these, but they're pricey: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/3D-Button-Analog-Sticks-Controller-Thumbstick-Replacement-Parts-for-PS-VITA-PSV-2000-Pulled/32354435935.html http://www.amazon.com/Right-Analog-Joystick-Control-PCH-2000/dp/B00VEHZQKM/ref=pd_sim_sbs_23_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0NF5Q3BRVSKKB8C6EEJN    Based on those two images, it looks like Vita 2K sticks use a blue ribbon cable versus the orange on the 1Ks."

vita,3e1830,CapnTeddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"Between the two I would probably suggest Ys.  Now, this is from anecdotal experience because I have not had the time to sit down and play either of them I have noticed that Ys seems to get more praise here in the vita reddit than SSD. Thats not to say that SSD is bad, it just seems that there are more positive discussions going on with Ys compared to SSD.   Again, that is pretty anecdotal though so take it with a grain of salt im sure people who have played both will be better able to give you a solid rundown of whats good or bad about both."
vita,3e1830,Luminous083,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"SSD story is grim and well crafted. With dark lore and a unique different concept from your ""average hero save the world story""  It also comes pack with 3 expansion stories. Grim, Sanctuary, and Avalon. Which all contains different characters that you play along with and read through their adventures with you. Combat is fun with a fully customizable char. Ranging from cool spells to, customizable char, unique outfits and passive abilities you can equips to add boost. It is a fantastic game i would recommend over ys.  Ys on the other hand is also pretty good. The story IS your average ""HERO SAVE THE WORLD"". Which isnt the best but is okay. Combat is a fun hack n slash puzzle action adventure rpg with a unique dodge,block, and skill system that can level up and evolve into more powerful skills. You have controls over X amont of party members each wielding their own unique weapons and skills, but is divided into 3 classes  Slash,Piercing, and Blunt which enemies have weaknesses and resistances to each category. Its a fun 25 hour rpg"
vita,3e1830,Elijah2798,0,Tue Jul 21 16:51:22 2015 UTC,"Considering that you can get both games digitally for like 37 total, I think you should do that instead (assuming you have a big enough memory card). So buy a $50 Playstation Store card.  Also, SSD for story, Ys for gameplay. Ys has pretty good gameplay, too. The gameplay in SSD is basically big open arenas full of monsters that attack you. It has cool spells and stuff, but it gets somewhat repetitive, while in Ys you'll be exploring new areas and meeting new characters."

Upon thinking of a few titles to add... it's tough to say, but I'll list some possibilities:   Corpse Party (PSP) -> Book of Shadows I didn't finish because I was disappointed, however 'Blood Drive' is coming to Vita-NA/EU 'soon'. Gravity Rush - short lived game, but it held my attention and is worth it if you find it on sale one of these days.  Freedom Wars/Soul Sacrifice Delta* - not a 'gripping' story, but does a gripping setting count? Solid gameplay.

vita,3dwyrl,bcRIPster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:41:39 2015 UTC,I've used Play-Asia for years for buying JP PSN pre-paid cards and never had an issue.
vita,3dwyrl,Scarmasu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:16:19 2015 UTC,I went used vita for my option. new vita for AUS and used vita for USA. It works ok well most of the time just need to make sure I bring the correct one whenever I take it out of the house and decide which one to play which games on since I can't move my saves to the other or PS tv.
vita,3dwcfx,jamesjoyce1882,9,Mon Jul 20 02:05:12 2015 UTC,They have separation issues.
vita,3dwcfx,GeneralChaz9,16,Mon Jul 20 04:43:15 2015 UTC,One thing to note is that Sony spent a lot of time on developing security measures for the vita especially since the PSP was riddled with piracy. It might be due to numerous checks on the file and calls from other functions that make it so slow.
vita,3dwcfx,Yoshikoo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:39:23 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that this is especially slow when deleting or copying games from ps+ so it makes sense that the vita does a bunch of extra steps in name of ""security"""
vita,3dwcfx,Karurosu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"Most likely the database needs to be re- organised, re-indexed or whatever. It's not as simple as deleting something on a computer due to proprietary file formats and management system etc"
vita,3dwcfx,AnimaxIRL,9,Mon Jul 20 03:33:27 2015 UTC,It takes forever on PS3 as well. I don't think Sony is the best at deletion

vita,3dwcfx,easterreddit,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:37:03 2015 UTC,"On PS3, I think it's because it deletes every last file of a game.  If there's a ton of them (SF4 for instance), it'll take a while."
vita,3dwcfx,Tjoeb123,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:25:58 2015 UTC,Everything deletes almost immediately on PS4 so that's nice.

vita,3dwcfx,hhhhojeihsu,3,Mon Jul 20 07:31:03 2015 UTC,"A filesystem doesn't actually delete files on a computer when you press delete, merely it deletes the indicator telling the operating system ""This file is here"". On the vita/PS3 (PS4 just deleted the allocation, same as a computer, but doesn't register until after a reboot) it actually deleted the entire file, a lengthy process, as to be truly deleted, it must be overwritten.  For more information Google ""RAW data deletion"""
vita,3dwcfx,KilledByVen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:23:22 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source to back this up, i.e. that files get completely overwritten on Vita/PS3?"
vita,3dwcfx,KilledByVen,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"Not for vita, but given that the reason ""you can't install from a ps4 only PS3"" and that this is how the PS3 OS operates, it's pretty obvious."
vita,3dwcfx,Teath123,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"Well it takes ages for simple things like deleting icons, so it's definitely not the size, and like someone said, it's probably security checks."
vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,-2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:22 2015 UTC,"'simple' operation... right... Anyway, I believe the culprit is read/write opspeed from the memcard. Needs further evidence."
vita,3dwcfx,milkmanjack,2,Mon Jul 20 03:33:59 2015 UTC,'simple' operation... right...   Are you implying deletion isn't simple or something? I'm so confused.
vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:42:27 2015 UTC,Depends on your definition of 'simple'. The way the person wrote it made it sound as if it is as simple as:  Game.delete();   -> done.
vita,3dwcfx,milkmanjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Doesn't depend on your definition. Depends on the relative difficulty of operations. Sure there's complex machines and microprocessors involved, but that's irrelevant to the question since at the software level all it takes is removing a reference to a file. Which I'm willing to bet is the simplest operation that can be done in a file system, if not close to it.  Deleting a file on a modern hard disk is probably as fast as deleting a file on a hard disk from 1999."
vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:58 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but I disagree with you. I don't quite understand why it would take 5 minutes, but if you wish to remove the fault of the memory card out of the equation, then what would you say is the cause?  Nvm. I read your other post. For now I'll just leave this sub-conversation be."

vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:16 2015 UTC,"Right. The more I think on it, the less sense it probably makes, but there's not a whole lot to go on here.  I disagree with your assumption, but then again I haven't had to diagnose any of the issues within the vita so I'm probably not the most reliable source here at all. Though, even if this is a seemingly bothersome issue for the OP if there are no other 'symptoms', then he/she would be happy to know that you don't have to delete too many games."
vita,3dwcfx,PSPHAXXOR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's possible, for the simple reason that in a delete operation, the file does not get completely overwritten. All that happens is that the file entries get removed from the file table in the file system. Even on an ancient memory card, that operation would therefore take only seconds."
vita,3dwcfx,milkmanjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:25 2015 UTC,"I cannot say for absolute certain, but it might be that the Vita is erasing the content by writing 0's in the sectors that it intends to erase. That would take a while if you have a shitty disk controller performing the write."
vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"If this was actually the case, it'd be a pretty god awful idea. There's a limited number of these operations you can do in memory, and the reason deleting is usually so fast is because they are ""quick"" deletes. The file system is just made unaware of the file.  Probably the answer is what was said in other threads. Database reoganizing / indexing and security bullshit."
vita,3dwcfx,illegaljokes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"If what you say is correct, then how exactly would 'that' take 5 minutes? Sounds quite preposterous in my opinion, unless of course they have a security routine that takes nearly the entire 5 minutes. I just can't see database 'reorganizing' taking up such a large amount of time."
vita,3dwcfx,mibuwolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:22 2015 UTC,May be the security bullshit includes overwriting with random 1s and 0s.
vita,3dvgf0,william12312,11,Sun Jul 19 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"Both would be sufficient given A. multiplayer doesn't die -> it will and B. the offline mode features intelligent AI teammates. Playing solo would be quite a bore.  Bonus points for making it a standalone game and having no part of the Call of Duty franchise other than maybe a storyline based around it in some fashion?  Activision needs to learn there is profit gained from short standalone games and don't necessarily have to have tons of fleshed out features. Besides, I'm also assuming that their playerbase is tired of the saturation of fps games on the market already.  People will come to stop playing CoD eventually, especially if their friends have 'other' games that interest them. There isn't much reason to keep moving on from one CoD installation to the next.  This is the primary reason why I quite playing since 'Black Ops'."

vita,3dvgf0,renadi,3,Mon Jul 20 00:44:55 2015 UTC,It's probably worth a buy as a mini downloadable spinoff at a reduced cost on any and probably every platform. I do hope they do it.

I like to set the 3DS down on a pillow or something and pluck at it with the stylus so it isn't too uncomfortable. Looking at the games you've listed above, you won't be disappointed with either game. Avoid the novel like the plague though, you get a much better experience by playing through and figuring things out slowly."
vita,3duvim,APhanpy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:00:39 2015 UTC,I played VLR without playing 999 (I don't have DS and I don't want to play on emulator). You can read a bit about story in 999 (and characters) and I would say you can give VLR a try. Some things clear up in late game and story of previous game is explained.

For crap TV, my son is 5 so except for a very few select shows that he is into, nothing he watches is going to grip my interest. For my wife its down to the fact that she doesn't like anything with a complex or heavy plot line so most of what we watch together tends to be quite superficial, or involve me explaining what's going on.

Replayability is awesome as long as you don't mind grinding. Like any other loot game you gotta grind to get some gears but the stages have different routes and things you can do differently so it doesn't get too boring.  Online plays can keep things fresh as well.    The characters are unique in play styles so even if you don't like certain characters you should be able to find one that fits you. My favorite is the Amazon, pure dps character w/ low armor."

vita,3duvim,gdk130,3,Sun Jul 19 21:01:20 2015 UTC,I would recommend Freedom Wars. It has a great story and I recommend looking into it. I would watch the first episode of a walkthrough to see what the story is about.
vita,3duvim,Reset_Tears,4,Sun Jul 19 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"The story is much more setting-driven than it is plot-driven. The series of events your character goes through is nothing special at all, but the world-building is pretty fantastic. Works great for a video game.   I think a lot of people miss out on fully immersing in the atmosphere of the game by not talking to any of the NPCs as they advance from level to level. I found it rather fun to go around talking to everyone, as they provided some interesting viewpoints on the world they lived in."
vita,3duvim,Elijah2798,3,Sun Jul 19 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"I talked to ALL the NPCs. As I said the world they set up was very nice, it was just a shame that the actual meat of the story was botched. It feels like it was a rushed game."
vita,3duvim,Elijah2798,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:22 2015 UTC,Agreed on the world building. I found that a lot of the things people get hung up on in the lower codes actually increased immersion. It's unfortunate that the plot doesn't hold up.
vita,3duvim,greg225,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"How grindy/repetitive is the fighting? Does it take much thought to play, or mostly button mashing?"
vita,3duvim,Elijah2798,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:04 2015 UTC,"Gameplay-wise Freedom Wars has good variety IMO. There are lots of different weapons to obtain and learn, and you can bring more than one with you when you go on missions. (So, for example, you can bring a sword and a gun, and switch back and forth between them on the fly.)   Enemies include people and Abductors (the giant robots), which come in a few varieties. You can approach fighting these in a number of ways. You have a grappling hook (called a Thorn) which allows you to scale buildings, as well as the Abductors themselves (which you can then sever off their limbs or weaponry, depending on what weapon or item you have on hand). You can use the Thorn to also drag an Abductor down, making it fall and giving you some time to safely attack it. (Note: Severing and dragging both involve button mashing to speed up the process.) There are also items such as grenades and mines you can utilize, and you can use commands for your robot partner to approach missions more strategically. Missions vary from simple ""defeat all the enemies"" to rescue missions that require retrieving civilians and safely returning them to escape pods.  Grinding takes the form of purchasing a wide assortment of upgrades. The level of customization for the game is pretty intense, and can take some time to really delve into (e.g. crafting the high-level weapons you want). The story mode isn't terribly long, though it gets quite challenging toward the end. What will take you much longer is whittling down your million-year sentence, which can be considered a long-term goal for those who are really into the game."

vita,3due1k,esveegee,22,Sun Jul 19 15:56:24 2015 UTC,That is remote play. You can't get full remote play with a ps3 unless you mod it. The PS4 has full remote play built in so you can navigate all the menus and play almost any game available.

vita,3dwvac,Battlesperger,3,Mon Jul 20 06:48:46 2015 UTC,"Some PS1 games can only be played if you first download them onto a PS3, then transfer the file to PS Vita. MGS1 is one of those games. If you know a friend with a PS3 you could sign into your account on their console, download the game(don't install it, just download), then transfer the file to the Vita.  For any future PS1 games you plan to purchase, if you can't purchase it from the PS Vita store then it typically can't be played on a Vita without being transferred. Just to save you time/money in the future.  On top of all this, some PS1 games cannot be played at all on a Vita. Spyro/Crash Bandicoot games for instance apparently can't be played on a NA account(though for some reason you can in EU)."

vita,3du8wo,GunplaDan,9,Sun Jul 19 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"When you remote play you are using the same screen as the ps4. You will be registered as basically the primary controller to the ps4.  Someone else can use your actual controller as a 2cd playable controller(but has to be logged into a different account or guest account). So you can play local games together.  If you ment, that can you use it to play a game and someone else uses the controller to play another, the answer is no,because remote play shares the screen as the ps4 making it just another controller but with a screen."

vita,3dwjh3,rekloki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:43:09 2015 UTC,I would recommend turning direct connection off and ethernet connecting your PS4 so the signal will be better from your router to the Vita
vita,3dwjh3,BlessingOfChaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:56:09 2015 UTC,"I’m guessing you’re using Direct Connection because your upload speeds are less than 4Mbps. If that’s not the case, I would strongly suggest you try to get your PS4 on a wired connection (buy some powerline adapters if you just can’t get your PS4 close enough) and connect through your network. Ive used both Direct Connect and Network and the latter is hands down better if your internet is fast enough. If you don’t have fast enough internet, there’s one thing you can try. This is just from my experience. Direct Connect is easily affected by competing signals. I used to live in an apartment and noticed when trying to DC near the wall where my neighbor had his router, it would very noticeably ruin my connection. After downloading a Wifi Analyzer app, I realized that my router and PS4 were on a VERY crowded frequency channel. I changed my routers channel to a much less crowded one which made the PS4 change the channel it uses for DC (you can’t change it manually as it just defaults to your routers channel) and it helped a lot. I also moved it to a spot at my place as far away as possible from other signals. Hopefully you don’t live in an apartment where everyone has their own router running because that would make finding a clear one that much harder. Also, having my Bluetooth headphones connected to my phone also weakened DC. Hope any of this helps"

It also adds new mechanics to old weapons, all for the better."
vita,3du4ii,JProllz,2,Sun Jul 19 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"I have both kiwami and sao but i have to say i enjoy kiwami more. It has more than double the content than the original aod, better balance and monster ai and enhanced graphics. I transferred my character from aod to kiwami and clocked in about additional 60+ hours and still not done. The new weapons feel nice and adds a new variety in team comps. Best thing is u can change each individual npc's behavior (attack only, support, follow, and free) in real time so that u can change strategies on the fly. The additional characters and the increased plot actually feels like a completed game if u felt dissatisfied by freedom wars and aod like i was.  That being said, sao has a shit ton of content. It feels really grindy but if u like mmorpgs and doing mini quests on the side it really does its job well. The boss fights are interesting but it gets a little repetitive (which is also tru for kiwami). I've only played 20 somewhat hours so i have still shit ton more to do which makes me think ill clock in another 100 in order to finish. Im not sure how much the gameplay improves later on and hopefully someon else can shed some light on it"

It wouldn't surprise me if Freedom wars also releases a sequel/update. In fact they should. So many unanswered questions...  Hmm I like how SAO offers so much to keep you busy. I've heard more people mentioning spending 100+ hours in game.   edit: Oh and thanks for the quick review on the new stuff in Kiwami this just might have convinced me.

If you are not a huge fanboy i doubt you will like it.  If you are looking for a good time sinker i can recommend you: Disgaea 4 (almost endless grindfest), Rogue Legacy (addictive rogue-lite), Trails in the Sky (charming rpg with superb writing and character development), Growlanser Wayfarer of Time (hidden gem from the psp era with mature story, tons of endings and waifufest included)."

vita,3du4ii,BrainKatana,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:23:31 2015 UTC,"Kiwami roughly doubled the number of missions, IIRC. They also added 3 new weapon types and some new demons to slay. It's also cross-play with the PS4 release, so finding a party is a bit more likely for MP. You can directly import your AoD save. If you've completed AoD, it might feel like ""half a game"" to you.  Sword Art Online is the closest you'll get to exploring Aincrad, and it's pretty well executed if you're a fan of the anime. There's tons of content, though it can be a bit of a grind if you want to master different weapons. I was pleasantly surprised by the combat system, although it is a bit ""MMO-esque"" with an auto attack and activated abilities. The combat is designed that way so you can trade aggro back and forth with your adventuring partner using the ""switch"" command. This is also generally the best time to recover your skill points that you use to execute big attacks. SAO is very well executed, but it's not the same active, combo-based combat of Kiwami at all. There's also relationship management (far more complex than trying to peek at the ladies in the hot springs in Toukiden).   Better relationships and giving your adventuring partners feedback in combat results in them doing better in tough situations like bosses. You can also participate in some inane conversation mini game where you try to guess what people are thinking because what they're saying doesn't make any sense. If you do it right, they like you more, so it's not wholly inaccurate compared to real life.  SAO was well worth 40 bucks for me, as was Kiwami. However, I didn't not play much of Age of Demons."
vita,3du4ii,BrainKatana,3,Sun Jul 19 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! You're making it very difficult for me. SAO really does seem interesting. I'm not sure how popular the relationship thing in games is in the west but I actually enjoy it. To me it adds more depth to a game by adding something completely different from combat. I liked this in Persona too.   I'm usually not a fan of ""MMO-esque"" combat systems but I ended up really enjoying Guild Wars. That's about the same thing right? Also how many hours did you spend in SAO If I may ask?  I really like the online cross-play for Kiwami I didn't know that yet. And just to be clear if I import my save from AoD do I simply continue from where I started?"
vita,3du4ii,bananakingkong,0,Sun Jul 19 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with the 'complexity' of the relationship system in SAO. If you're playing it in English, most of the 'complexity' of the relationship system comes out of not being able to understand what they're talking about.   The girls will ask you dumb stuff that don't make any sense in English, like in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLypxcl2To4 . Of course, they'll end up asking the same 15 or so questions over and over again, and the complexity comes from remembering which one of two responses you give that will make her happy. The same holds half true for battle feedback. You have to guess what they mean when they ask for battle feedback.  All in all, anything outside of the main quest dialogue in SAO is pretty horribly translated. I would look at gameplay videos, especially of the non-combat parts, to see if you're really able to stand the terrible translation, which even encompasses the game tutorial."
vita,3du4ii,bananakingkong,0,Sun Jul 19 19:31:43 2015 UTC,I already knew about the terrible translation. But that completely caught me off guard. Dear god did they even have the right script?
vita,3du4ii,d1rkSMATHERS,2,Sun Jul 19 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"Not really. It was a second-thought translation done in Hong Kong--it was never meant to be released in NA. Bandai ""reassured"" users there was going to be be a through edit of the script, but it never happened.  Hell, even if the game was in perfect English, the game was still pretty bad, most notably the ""town"" you could explore is the only town out of the remaining 25 floors. The other 25 FL are just a ""screenshot"" with vendor functions.   The worst of this is Bandai is refusing to patch the game with a updated translation---they made it a PS4 only."

vita,3du4ii,Jorumvar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"I suppose you could compare the moment-to-moment combat in SAO with the original Guild Wars. You wind up slotting abilities that you unlock over the course of the game, so you have to pick stuff that complements your weapons and play style. The method of unlocking is pure grind (true to form of the fictional game's design in the show).  In SAO, you don't start off at level 1, either. IIRC you start off close to level 100, because the game picks up on an alternate timeline after a certain point in the anime. The main character Kirito has already gained the ability to wield 2 swords in combat, and his compatriots are also highly skilled as well. That doesn't stop you from learning the other weapons in the game, though. You can drop dual swords and switch to a katana, or a mace and shield, or a pole arm, etc...you just have to unlock the skills from a much lower level, while with dual swords you already have a pretty full kit.  I should also say that if you haven't seen the anime, you might want to check it out, at least up to episode 14, because that will give you background on the world, the characters in it, and to an extent what they have been through to bring them to this point.  As for how much time I've put into it, I'm a terrible measure of it. I tend to ""nibble"" at games instead of focusing on one. I've seen others consistently value it at over 50 hours just for the main story, and then over 100 if you want to trophy chase or try out all the weapons, etc. As for me, I've gone through the first couple of floors so far, and I've really enjoyed it. There is a boatload of content, it seems.  Another thing worth noting is that the game starts you in a place called the ""Hollow Area."" This is the area that was added for this release of the game. A lot of the content comes from a PSP game called ""SAO: Infinity Moment,"" which takes place in Aincrad, the world featured in the first season of the anime. At the starting area of the game, you have the option to go back to Aincrad, which I recommend when you're starting out, as enemies are a bit easier there than in the Hollow Area.  With regards to your Toukiden save, yes, you can pick up where you left off in AoD.  As for your decision, the advice I usually give is to pick the different thing. Whether you like it or not, you've learned something about your tastes, which makes you better at these decisions in the future."
vita,3du4ii,Jack_Hat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"Ah the original Guild Wars huh. I can't remember how the combat system was compared to Guild Wars 2. Since that was really well done for an MMO. But that aside I think I'll be able to enjoy it. I'm not that dead set on a certain combat system. I just have my preferences.  Yea I noticed you start a 100. Thought that was interesting but I suspected as much since I was already kind of up to speed on the story.  Yep, done! About to start the second season as we speak.  Ah same here so I understand. But glad to hear it's not a game I'll beat in a day or 2.  I'll keep that in mind when I get it, thanks!  That's excellent advice actually. Something I'll definitely remember for future decision making. Thank you."
vita,3du4ii,ar4757,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"To clarify my comment about the original Guild Wars:  In GW, you had an auto attack that was based on your equipped weapon, and then you slotted a ""build"" of abilities into a finite number of ability slots (in GWs case, the limit was 8). Activating a skill in GW triggered the ability (cast time, etc) and consumed energy (the analogue in SAO is your Skill Points/SP).   So they're actually really similar mechanically. That probably explains why I liked it..."

From within your house, you only need a decent router. You can have no internet connection if you want, only good WiFi signal on your Vita and PS4 (if you can, connect your PS4 wired to the router). If you are close enough to the PS4 the Vita can connect directly so this will work even without any router."

Direct connect does not require any sort of internet connection, so your internet speed does not matter.  However if you're attempting to connect over wifi, then your internet connection does matter."
vita,3dtw4b,Der-Kleine,12,Sun Jul 19 12:38:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have a PS4, so I'm not really an expert on remoteplay (I'm more of an Nvidia GameStream person if you know what I mean), but I'm pretty sure you're forgetting an option.   If you don't connect directly to your PS4 and instead do so via your home's wifi network (via your router) you of course won't be using your internet connection, since you're still just moving data within your home. Your internet speed is completely irrelevant in that case, what's more important is that your router has decent wifi. (and it's probably a good idea to use a wired connection for your PS4 in that case).  What will use your internet is if you're streaming from outside of your home from a completely different network. Say you're at a friends house and want to stream your PS4 over the internet, that of course will require a good internet connection.  Basically: If you're streaming within your home your internet's speed shouldn't matter at all."

P3 is quite a bit darker - it's no Lucifer's Call, but has a generally solemn tone and some dark themes and moments.  Danganronpa is also quite dark and mature, despite its styling and humour. It's very darkly humorous and the contrast of brutal murders with humour and a fairly bright art style can be a little unsettling. Definitely check it out, it's two fantastic games.  In a similar vein to Danganronpa is Virtues last reward, which is also amazing, but I'd recommend you play 999 first.  Those come to mind most, but there are many others, especially considering the back catalogue"

It's different, not dated.  And Persona 4 is not a serious/mature game, yes it has murders but it's an extremely light hearted game and gets called a scooby-doo simulator for that very reason."

Trails in the Sky was the first JRPG I beat (Because I wasn't into them much as a kid), and it just blew me away, and was pretty much my gateway into my favorite genre now.   The world building is just mindblowing, and every character has a personality, and a story. The story is quite long, and very engaging, and the cliffhanger ending is a complete tearjerker as well. I had a LOT of fun playing it. Falcom makes great games, so I highly recommend the Ys series as well (You can get Memories of Celceta, Oath in Felghana, I+II Chronicles, and Seven on Vita, actually).

vita,3dtdoe,Clessiah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:49:27 2015 UTC,There are English fan translations for the psp. You can run them on a cfw psp or in an emulator.
vita,3dtdoe,larshove1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:27 2015 UTC,"As far as I checked, the translation patch isn't 100% complete - checked that on the PPSSPP emulator on my iPad.  Besides, I'd rather pay the developer to encourage such localizations."

That improved performance for some sections of the game but , it still seriously chugs in other sections.  I think it is the best they could do for the budget they had on the vuta version and the exclusivety with gamestop."
vita,3dtvbh,LoSouLibra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit further into it now, the lag isn't too bad in toybox mode but it's horrendous in Spider-mans levels. I've heard off a few friends that the console versions tend to lag a bit at times and it just seems massively amplified in the Vita version.   It's a shame really, the graphics aren't exactly pushing, and when it doesn't lag it's still a nice stylish game. I'd say it's worth getting if you're aware of it."

The best thing I've found is that I can download all the previous games I bought/got from the PS+ store. Also it seems that any games from PS+ that I downloaded for my PS4 that have a Vita version are also in my downloads list too!  Are there any other things that people might not know that I can do with this great piece of kit? I really bought it mainly for the PS4 remote play but I'm interested in unlocking more secrets.

vita,3dtgnw,shikitohno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"Most games will have separate save slots, but often with content tied together.  Obviously you can't have two different sets of trophies, but say on games the have a new game plus feature or certain bonus unlockables, you can only unlock it once.  If you beat Persona 4 Golden and your spouse starts after you beat it, I'm pretty sure they can't play a non-NG+ game without wiping your save.  So, for the most part it'll be cool, but sometimes things will work weird."
vita,3dtgnw,ishkabibbel2000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:20:57 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but what about having 2 separate mem cards and swapping them out?

vita,3dtgnw,shikitohno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"Given that OP asked specifically about save slots for games and mentions knowing that switching accounts isn't as easy as a PS4, I assumed they're aware of that option.

vita,3dtgnw,i_wasnt_prepared,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:23 2015 UTC,Hello everyone! Just made an impulse buy and bought vita! It was only 89€ brand new with 8gb and 5 games to download (crazy right? Bought it at Staples). The thing is those games can only be downloaded on European psn. I know memory cards are attached to a psn account. If I buy another memory card how is the process of switching accounts? Is it easy? Or I have to format vita all the time?
vita,3dtgnw,theCactiKing,2,Sun Jul 19 15:53:28 2015 UTC,"You do have to reformat every time you switch :(  Your game and save data is all on the memory card, so you don't have to reinstall everything. But you do have to sit through the reformatting process, including the startup video.   You'll also wipe your wallpaper/theme settings. They're still saved to your card and can be reapplied, but if you've made an art project of your application pages, it can be annoying to set it all up again.  TL;DR: Can be done with no content loss, but can be annoying depending on your patience and level of screen organization OCD"

vita,3dtgnw,Some_Random_Asian,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:43 2015 UTC,Hi guys :) I've just recently purchased a Vita and would like to ask you guys if it's worth getting a PS+ subscription in the R3 region. (I do have an R1 account but resetting the device just to change accounts is annoying). Thanks in advance.
vita,3dtgnw,clee290,2,Sun Jul 19 10:16:25 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much up to you. One thing I would recommend is to wait until you absolutely need it. So, if you like July's free games, get it. If not, wait for August, and keep waiting until there are free games you want to play. Or if there is a sale that you want to take advantage of."
vita,3dtgnw,Some_Random_Asian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I might be doing that. One question though, for example I bought one month of PS+ in August for a certain free game. Could I still play it in September?"
vita,3dtgnw,clee290,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"You can only play it as long as you have PS+. So let's say you get a month of PS+ on August 5th, you'll be able to play your free games until September 5th (or 6th?). Once your PS+ expire, you can't play them until you resubscribe to PS+ again."

vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,2,Sun Jul 19 10:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a screen protector, and maybe a decal over the front face just because it attracts so many fingerprints.

vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"I personally bought my OLED from eBay for around $4. It's a good decal except for the fact that it doesn't wrap around the entire Vita, which I initially thought it would. As for a screen protector, anything will do, honestly. Even the cheapest ones are good, but if you're looking for something robust, I recall someone suggesting a tempered glass screen protector that they found on Amazon.   Give it a look, if you need any more help, just let me know!"
vita,3dtgnw,Stuifiee,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:06 2015 UTC,Is there a way to turn that camera shutter sound off? I can't find the option in the settings. That sound is bloody loud.
vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:58:35 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the shutter noise is always on due to laws in Japan pertaining to the use of cameras and shutter sounds.  The Vita camera isn't all that great anyway hahaha  Edited for word*"
vita,3dtgnw,Stuifiee,3,Sun Jul 19 10:45:02 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, that sucks. In the meantime, I discovered that firmly pressing your thumbs on the speakers pretty much mutes the sound, so that's something."

vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:32:17 2015 UTC,"Have you tried to contact Sony about it? If not, I'm pretty sure some threads exist on this topic, just give the searchbar a search!"

I recently am harboring the idea of buying a Vita and was excited to do so, but was disheartened by the lack of titles both available and upcoming. What is the community's view on this? I love Sony, I love PlayStation, it's a really sad observation by me. Maybe if I was more interested in indie/japanese games? I do have a PS4 and maybe my expectations were a bit too high for a handheld."
vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,4,Sun Jul 19 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"I love Sony, I love PlayStation and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with my Vita! Take a look around at the library of games, and what interests you. Yes, take peoples suggestions, but also look into it on your own. I was in the same place as you before I got a Vita, I thought there was nothing for me and that indie/Japanese games weren't for me, but I found them insanely satisfying - not all of course, but some. My library is extremely small, but I enjoy Freedom Wars, and Killzone; I've enjoyed Minecraft on the go and adored every minute of Gravity Rush. If I had expendable money at the moment, I'd rush and get Persona 4, and Final Fantasy X, along with Hyperdimension, and all the other obscure games the Vita has to offer. I've actually just started the first Danganronpa( translated on PSP) and am seriously thinking of purchasing the second one and Ultra Despair Girls when the time comes!   Go on open minded and you'll find a very fitting system that just gets a lot more flack than it deserves. Cheers, and do let me know how it goes! :)"
vita,3dtgnw,DrTitanium,5,Sun Jul 19 10:42:41 2015 UTC,"I've been looking into this too and pricing is the only thing putting me off. I'm really interested in Vita for its exclusives like P4G, Final Fantasy, Gravity Rush and some JRPGs. Do you think it's a bad time to buy and I might be better off waiting for a price drop, considering releases are so scant at the moment?"

vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,2,Mon Jul 20 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know about a price drop anytime soon. An E3 price drop was rumored but never happened. Memory Cards are still ridiculously at MSRP, but you can find them at some retailers at clearance prices. The only problem with that is that scalpers quickly buy them up and sell them on eBay. You could wait for Gamescon for a price drop, or even Black Friday(if you want to wait), but aside from that, there's no knowing if it will drop. Games are fairly cheap, P4G is usually $20, Gravity Rush was once on the PS Store for $0.81, so game prices aren't a problem, per se."
vita,3dtgnw,DrTitanium,3,Mon Jul 20 01:17:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, especially the E3 rumour mill, I hadn't heard of that. I tend to keep up to date with Microsoft and Sony moreso than Sony's developments. I had heard they announced a winding down of the Vita at E3? Either way, thanks for clarifying that, especially the memory cards. Looking at some of the bundles (e.g. Adventure Bundle) that come with an 8GB card as a factor in buying it. I think I'll take the plunge in a week or so."
vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:38 2015 UTC,"They didn't really wind down at E3, more than they totally ignored its existence and only mentioned it for less than 15 seconds. They had a game reel put on online after the conference that showed upcoming games like Jurassic World and Tales of the Borderlands, but any news of AAA development was shut down by Yoshida.  Regardless, give the Adventure Bundle a shot, I think it's a great value. If you do, PSN multiplayer is where it's at - add the Vita community :)"
vita,3dtgnw,caramelraisins,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"Hi! It's been a few hours since I posted that and I've actually come to know there's a lot more games than my research initially let on, yay! Really excited to actually delve into this. Still looking into it and everything, and weighing between the original and the slim, although I think I can only avail the Slim here in our area. Major points: the screen (LCD vs OLED) and USB cord (unique vs common microUSB).    I was able to borrow a Vita in the past and the dude had Persona 4. Quite interesting, but those kind of games really are not for me.. Remote play is a strong point, though. I wish they'd port more, the PS4 seriously has good titles.  Edit: I've never played Minecraft before, and it's quite interesting to think I'll be getting my start on the Vita :)"
vita,3dtgnw,Rotato_chips,2,Sun Jul 19 10:57:34 2015 UTC,"The slim is better imo. If you never saw the OLED in real life alongside the slim screen you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The extended battery life and microusb outweighs a 'better' screen  If you have a ps4 and want remote play get the slim as the L2 trigger grip, which many people recommend for remote play,are only available for the slim model.( Look at reviews for the trigger grips before you buy them )"
vita,3dtgnw,gdk130,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"are trigger grips really that useful? I've never really used any controller mods on any consoles I've owned, so new to that whole thing"
vita,3dtgnw,Rotato_chips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"Well the vita doesn't have physical R2 buttons, only the back touchpad..and most people prefer physical buttons to press, so they made trigger grips to compensate what people are accustomed too."
vita,3dtgnw,caramelraisins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"That's what they keep saying (you won't notice it if you haven't used the OLED one) but I have a Note 4 (Super AMOLED) and my eyes are quite used to the luxury so I'm quite nervous XD Aside from that I do think the slim is better in every way, and yeah the extended battery life and microusb is a no brainer.  Thanks for the tip! Hope that's available in my area."
vita,3dtgnw,Rotato_chips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:20:35 2015 UTC,No problem 😅 if you're using your vita home for the most part like me the longer battery life is less of an issue since you could just plug it in whenever
vita,3dtgnw,ConfusedAndDazzed,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"See! The gems in the library are hidden! All it takes is a little extra work.   I personally have the OLED only because it's the only one that was available at the time of my purchase. I really like the Slim, too, but I'd import one for the cool color schemes.

I'd love to keep both, but I'd probably pass one onto my sister just 'cause :)  In my area, the Vita is tremendously undervalued. Wal-Mart had the Borderlands 2 Bundle for $99 for a couple of days and the values on Craigslist and other sites just dropped. I'd be lucky if I could get $100 for mine with the case, and games. Selling would be very difficult haha"

I don't know if both are valid or not - or one might be an update - but if you cancel the one without the exclamations - and download the Mutant Blobs Attack!!! - I think that's the main game, if there's an update you can check once it's installed.   The double file thing has happened a few times where it seems to be downloading a game twice, I'm baffled by it to be honest."

Worst case scenario: you have a faulty memory card..  In both cases, the solution is to redownload the installer and retry.. If that doesn't work, rebuild the database or use a different card and repeat..  Good luck!"
vita,3dv707,That1McGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:24 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Keep in mind you'll need a relatively substantial memory card if you intend on downloading games. That will add to that price.

They are very expensive, more valuable than games generally. For reference, I got a near mint used Vita 2 weeks ago on eBay that came with a case, screen protector, 16GB card, 8GB card, 2 4GB cards, and Y's for $120. The deal you're getting is decent, but if you aren't wanting those games you can find a better deal to suit your needs."

vita,3dv707,Rotato_chips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"No it was a 1000. A lot on eBay are going for about the same, but I did luck out some with mine in that it had memory cards and a game I would have bought anyway. The hard thing is finding them with memory cards. You just have to filter out the Buy It Now ones, stick to auctions, and be patient. I lost 3 other Vita auctions before winning that one."
vita,3dv707,wh1036,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:40 2015 UTC,Are they games you'd play? How about condition? How old is it? I'm assuming that the battery can still hold a nearly full charge.  For reference: I paid $200 for a new JP import vita and for me it was worthwhile and this was maybe 6 months ago? So... your deal is still sufficiently good enough to say you didn't 'waste' any money given my questions above are within an acceptable tolerance.  I also suggest you give a reason why you want a vita? What are your foreseeable purchases game-wise?

vita,3dv707,pben95,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"Color choice. Also, when I was buying it was honestly the best deal available. The other choices for $200 were combo deals that gave you Borderlands 2 or some shit for relatively the same price and there might have been shipping or taxes involved. I'm not sure.  If there was a substantial cost difference I wouldn't have bothered. A color is a color, but I already have a black PSP1000 and white&blue is a nice change."
vita,3dv707,mibuwolf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Unless the Vita is heavily scratched and damaged in some way, which I assume is not, then yeah. $100 is probably a good deal."

FIFA 14 and lower have online multiplayer (not FUT or Online Seasons, just head to head matches, but at least it has that). If you want to play online on vita, FIFA 14 is the one to get, not FIFA 15.

Generally speaking, this isn't entirely shocking that large developers are switching resources from portable consoles to mobile.  There's a much larger user base on mobile and much more money to be made on mobile, and the trend is clear.  Any non-Nintendo portable gaming console is going to struggle mightily from here on out.  Even Nintendo is largely saved because of Nintendo games - take those completely away and the 3DS would probably be suffering from the same struggles as the Vita."

If you're smart about your movements (which you learn through endless deaths), you can finish a stage in complete stealth and get all the bonuses. Play it through like Metal Gear Solid; just walk down the corridor past a patrol, slip into the next room, shoot out the camera and then backstab the next guard before alarm is sound.

Everyone should play that game. It's probably the best Killzone game - at least for fans, as it does something different.  I'd play it regular but I have a backlog, I made sure to buy the Bot pack so if it does go offline / people stop playing, I can still play the game. Such an amazing little gem, best handheld shooter ever made, probably will be for a long time.  As you can see, I'm a fan."

The game looks perfect, probably even better on the Vita's OLED / small screen. If you'd have said when I was 14/15 - ""You're going to be playing these games on a handheld device one day"" I'd have slapped you silly, because I couldn't even fathom that being a thing that would happen. As someone who played MGS 2 a dozen times and the third one a good few times - it amazing to see it portable. One of the reasons the Vita is such an important piece of equipment.  Bonus tid bit for Vita/MGS fans - during the announcement era of Vita - Hideo Kojima declared the Vita was so powerful it could play a section of MGS4 with practically no changes - as he'd done. However, though I was hopeful - the fact Xbox360 would have needed 7 discs to fit the game on, it probably wouldn't have worked out well on Vita."

Definitely worth a look if you have any interest in the franchise."
vita,3drh0a,LoSouLibra,2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:46 2015 UTC,"Not even a port. It's an original game in the series with it's own story mode, characters, tools, assets etc. Definitely one of the best LBP games and beats out the PS3/PS4 big brothers in some ways."
vita,3drh0a,Sulinder711,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"While it is an enjoyable game, I don't think it's nearly as good or even comparable to the console games. The lack of decent community levels kind of ruined it for me."
vita,3drh0a,LoSouLibra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:11:47 2015 UTC,"It dried up with new content due to Vita's failure as a platform and due to the creator community not having much of a player base to keep them interested in entertaining people with hundreds of hours of work, but the Team Pick list for the 2 years the community management curated it, provided plenty of amazing community levels. For the time span, it was definitely a better quality to content ratio considering the 10 million ish levels for LBP1, 2 and 3 combined (through backwards compatibility) are 99% trash, minus the 1,000 or so Team Picks/MM Picks, Community Forum spotlights, and the new Level of the Day feature added to LBP3 a few months back.  The story mode is emulating LBP 1 & 2's style, but does more conceptually and mechanically than either of those games did, even though I'd say 1 & 2 have more charm. The create mode is objectively better than 1 & 2 since it has the full suite of tools, plus more, is more efficient in terms of interface and load times, consistent framerate performance and logic latency (even things as simple as 0.0 timers, or notes that didn't come to even LBP3 until a recent patch). It's also the most stable to create in and most bug free as an overall game, out of the whole series of games, with LBP3 being the worst (but getting better)."
vita,3drh0a,Sulinder711,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"I agree that it does have a very solid create mode, and it's fun to create levels on the go. However, I still don't think you can really compare the community levels on Vita to those on consoles. Yes I realize that it is a result of the smaller player base but that doesn't change the fact that it makes the game significantly less entertaining and less replayable than the console games.   On Vita, only the top Team Pick levels are playable, and they're nowhere near as well built as the top levels on console. Yes the ratio of good to bad levels may be higher than in the console games, but that's completely irrelevant. Who cares if there are a ton of crappy levels published for the console if there's still plenty of high-quality levels to keep you busy for hours on end.  Also, LBP3 does have its issues, but I would still consider it the best LBP game available right now. It has many bugs (although significantly fewer than at launch) and it is easily the least innovative LBP game ever released (other than maybe LBP on PSP). However, it has the most advanced create mode and it has the best community levels, considering it has every community level from LBP 1 & 2 as well). Personally, I enjoyed the story modes of 1 & 2 more but 3 was still pretty good. The superior create mode and community levels make it the best LBP game to date."
vita,3drh0a,LoSouLibra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"On Vita, only the top Team Pick levels are playable, and they're nowhere near as well built as the top levels on console.    Not true. The community creator base that produces and produced levels and games in LBPV was mostly comprised of the same, most dedicated creators that created in LBP1 & 2 and play LBP3 now. At the time of LBPV's release, these creators were plying 4 years of experience and expertise from LBP1 & 2, and anything they made at the time was utilizing everything they knew and all their skill/talent for optimization and realizing interesting ideas in general, to do something with an even more improved toolset, better than whatever they'd last made in the previous entry. I can personally attest that this: http://vita.lbp.me/v/9254d is farrrr more efficiently engineered, and technically advanced behind the scenes, more visually appealing, and delivered a better end result of gameplay for the player than this: https://lbp.me/v/9dx5yw   Who cares if there are a ton of crappy levels published for the console if there's still plenty of high-quality levels to keep you busy for hours on end.   Less spam to sift through means quality is easier to find, and easier to deliver using the community management systems that are in place now. Quality content being easier to find means that dedicated creators are actually rewarded with incentive to create, because people can actually find, play and enjoy their levels, which only results in more quality from creators, and more good creators coming into their own as they find reasons to create.   Also, LBP3 does have its issues, but I would still consider it the best LBP game available right now. It has many bugs (although significantly fewer than at launch) and it is easily the least innovative LBP game ever released (other than maybe LBP on PSP).   It's got some seriously great features, and it is better now than at launch, but all the technical frustration, bugs and hurdles drove away a lot of creators and splintered the core community that really push the create mode to it's limits. Most have either slowed down, stopped altogether, been hired out to work on DLC (or the story modes for both LBPV and LBP3). The current creator base that's risen to fill the void is pretty conservative when it comes to trying new things that aren't just nicely made, straight forward platformer levels or eye candy, and have a less developed skillset/ambitious vision than the player base that departed - because that old player base had already moved on from stuff like that.   However, it has the most advanced create mode   There's nothing really more advanced about it. It allows for quite a few new things that weren't possible before, but all the new stuff requires the same skillsets as before and really pushing the game to be something it's not, requires the same kind of rule breaking and finesse that things like the old layer glitch, and level emitting used to.  That initial drop in creator community means expansive additions like analog piston output, 16 layers, broadcast chips, animation tweaker, custom power ups and dynamic thermo, has been wasted potential for almost a year, stunting the game's growth. It's in recovery now, thanks to a patch, but it's only really getting started again, compared to LBPV which was on a roll from day 1.   and it has the best community levels, considering it has every community level from LBP 1 & 2 as well)   Like LBP2's backwards compatibility, almost every great LBP1 & 2 level is broken in LBP3's engine, to the point that they don't work, can't be completed, perform worse, can't be altered without crashing or breaking, or simply look completely wrong. It's a problem because, unlike LBP2, creators aren't allowed to set their levels that were made in the previous game to be playable only in the previous game. LBPV not even having this issue, and being completely self-contained, was a fresh start, clean slate, and less cumbersome experience for the little time it was relevant. Many think LBP3 would have been better off if it ditched compatibility with the old engine and levels completely, and only tried to incorporate previous materials, costumes, etc that players own from previous LBP games/DLC.  I enjoy all of them, including 3 (which really is starting to turn around and bring people back), but any dedicated creator that's been deep in every game from the get go can tell you that LBPV is a fine tuned machine that iterated on LBP2's toolset and engine without flaw, and even corrected a lot of problems that 2 still had. No beef, though. More power to ya, 'cause LBP community and LBP3 needs all the love and players who enjoy it that it can get."

Amazing game, loved it and cherish the fact it was on Vita (and PS3) first, as its gone everywhere now. Looking forward to Severed."

I think I got to some crazy platforming bit where falling a long way didn't result in death, but it resulted in a total slog to get back to where I'd fallen so I just parked it. Might go back to it now I've been reminded. :)  The stand out Vita launch era game for me has to be Unit 13. Zipper's last hurrah and it made up for how disappointed I was with SOCOM 4. Unit 13 just kept on giving, even after Platinum, and I believe I'll still go back to it during my winter commute (most of the darker levels aren't great when there's a lot of glare on the screen). The very final scene of the single player campaign always makes me sad, though - it clearly telegraphs that they thought they'd be making a sequel.  Another forgotten Vita title for me was Mutant Blobs Attack. Clever and considered use of the Vita's touch and tilt functionality at certain points felt like smart, nuanced gameplay mechanics rather than just being shoehorned in there to exploit the capability."

No matter what I did, the screen thing always said that there is no memory card inserted. Just tried it again and saving worked. The first time the game did NOT ask me to save directly after choosing a character. So if that's missing, restart the game before playing the adventure to not lose your progress.

vita,3dry06,IAmZingy,7,Sat Jul 18 22:09:56 2015 UTC,Did you format the whole system?  Edit: Including the memory stick?
vita,3dry06,apothicca,3,Sat Jul 18 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"Format the memory card either in ""Settings"" - > ""Format"" or go into safe mode and do it and you should be able too. Otherwise if that doesn't work you could go into safe mode and then select ""Rebuild Database"" to see if that works. Formatting the memory card should work though."
vita,3dry06,chenta383,3,Sat Jul 18 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"Best, and IMO easiest is through safe mode. and do both the system and the memory card while in safe mode, or you'll have to do it twice. I did cause i forgot to do both."

vita,3dq9k6,somehokie,3,Sat Jul 18 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, new to vita, long time PS3/4 player though, and I'm finding this really bizarre... Never used the store on my PSP only had physical copies, but we rarely have stuff missing from it opposed to NA (consider that the ""stock"" comparison if you will). However, since getting a vita, I've noticed more and more that the vita seems to have nothing available. It's really strange!"
vita,3dq9k6,vox165,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I got a free copy on the PSP when it came out as a perk for working at a game retailer. I thought nothing of it, but gave it a shot and was blown away. Only when I played it did I realize it was made by the phenomenal game studio Level-5 (makers of Dark Cloud, the Layton series, Ni-No-Kuni, Fantasy Life and many more).  I can't recommend this game enough to fans of S-RPGs."

vita,3dq9k6,adarkfable,0,Sat Jul 18 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"Recommended 100%. I was a huge fan of FFT advanced and I found Gungnir much more fun than FFT:WoTL.  I would advice against Disgaea. The game is alright, but it's not really in the same vein as FFT. It's more of a grind than strategy."
vita,3dq9k6,TheUnholyBBQ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"now, I'm gonna try to make this not sound like an angry nerd rant and forgive me if I fail but Disgaea is not a grindy game really at all until after you beat the 30-90 hour main story despite what everyone hears about it online. Even then there's a lot to do before the grind fest kicks in, and that only kicks in if you decide you absolutely have to beat Baal and get everyone to level 9999, but the game is perfectly fine if you don't decide to do that and everything before that is generally strategy based. also if you get to level 9999 there are still enemies that can be a challenge if you're not smart"
vita,3dq9k6,MrPringles23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"I get you. I agree, the game is fantastic and I may have worded my ideas wrong. What I meant is, the game seems to put an emphasis on the character's crazy abilities instead of positioning and having a well balanced team.  Maybe the mechanics flew over my head, but when I played the games, the dynamic was completely different from something like FFT or TO. Then you throw in the classroom, detention and all these other mechanics and it kind of feels like the essence is lost.  Don't misinterpret me, Disgaea is fantastic! I love leveling up weapons on the weapon world, for example, but it does differ considerably from the games I previously mentioned. Whether that's good or bad is entirely subjective, but any TBS fan would agree that Disgaea is a staple in the genre and a VERY good game."
vita,3dq9k6,gizayabasu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:07 2015 UTC,"heh, sounds like your problem was you only played Disgaea 3 (widely considered the worst in the series) but that's fine; and yes, it is a VERY different game with a very different feel to it but I didn't want it being passed off as just ""grindy""  but I enjoy all these games and for the most part everyone I know who's played any of them have enjoyed the others as well despite the differences, so it's always worth checking all the games before just dismissing them"
vita,3dq9k6,TheUnholyBBQ,0,Sun Jul 19 03:28:40 2015 UTC,there is no game more fun then FFT WOTL   maby you didnt have the book i played thru that game FULLY 4 times before i got tired of that game  i think around 370 hours its the only game besides dark souls and borderlands 2 that iv ever re-played
vita,3dq9k6,SupaWalrus,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"the genre is SRPG  or tactical rpg. like some other people said, Disgaea, Hyper Noire, honestly not many choices for the vita. PSP had some decent ones...but since you mentioned Tactics Ogre, you've probably played them."
vita,3dq9k6,FringePhilosophy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:39:05 2015 UTC,Yea I've been looking into disgaea but wasn't aware Noire was in the same genre! I'll have to look into that. How different is it compared to the standard Nep stream?
vita,3dq9k6,socialjusticeorc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:10:41 2015 UTC,"Never really played any of the neps. bought two for the backlog. gameplay wise, Noire is decent. less customization than disgaea, tactics or tactics ogre. you have set characters with set moves. hokey story. decent tactical gameplay though.   If you liked FFA, I'd go for Disgaea. FFA and FFA2 are two of my favorites... gameplay wise, I like them more than FFT. (the stories however...)   Disgaea 4 is fucking massive. HUGE. almost an overwhelmingly large amount of things to do and things to improve on. does a good job of walking you through its features. the game is a beast.   Noire is a lot more streamlined. I like disgaea for the randomness and almost roguelike action in the Item world and Chara world. and I'm obsessed with creating/tailoring my own fighting force."

vita,3dntfc,RickyFromVegas,14,Sat Jul 18 05:50:21 2015 UTC,Is Battlefront 2 any good on the Vita? I played it a long time ago when it originally came out but sometimes games don't hold up well.
vita,3dntfc,bmsmcr,11,Fri Jul 17 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"I had fun with it on Vita. It lacks the campaign, but has Galactic Conquest. Controls are better on the Vita with the second stick (I think)!"
vita,3dntfc,clarkision,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"I've been playing for a little bit and have found the controls to be pretty bad. There is no setting that allows me to use a stick to move and stick to look around freely.   The closest I found was retro mode and that forces me to play it with the camera controls on the left and movement on the right.  I remember loving the hell out of this game, but my god the controls are tough to master"
vita,3dntfc,kinuman93,2,Sat Jul 18 06:19:20 2015 UTC,This will change everything. Controls aren't perfect but this pretty much solves your problem.
vita,3dntfc,NordicDong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:49:20 2015 UTC,"Huh? You can move with the left stick and look around with the right stick. Just not in space since vehicles use the action buttons for different things, and you map the stick to those buttons."

vita,3dntfc,gingerswithasoul,4,Sun Jul 19 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yes! Just make sure you set the game to use dual analogs in the Vita menu. Game on the PSP had a bit of lag, but the Vita runs it at a solid/locked 30-60 fps. Although the graphics are not PS2 quality, they are damn fine and look great for a handheld Battlefront title. I highly recommend, especially at this price."

The controls are technically not broken, but this game plays ""like"" a broken game because the controls are terrible. If you've ever played the original dragon's lair, it's similar to that. Some people may find the trial and error of perfecting the timing fun, but I found it annoying because it's not based around any intuitive visual hints or clues. You just have to keep trying until you master it."
vita,3dntfc,mightystewbacca,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:08 2015 UTC,Another World is one of the most influential adventure games every made. To not recommend it at this price is a ridiculous. It's a masterpiece of it's time.
vita,3dntfc,wyze511,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:00:21 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but I personally think paying anything this game as a game is too much. If you want to honor the game developers and designers for the legacy they left, fine. If you want to feel nostalgic, that's great. But I think outside of those two realms this game has no value. I think there is a reason it's as cheap as it is, so there aren't as many complaints when people realize they spent money on it."
vita,3dntfc,mightystewbacca,2,Sun Jul 19 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"yeah I have the same doubts about noire :C, maybe someone can tell us if it worth or not"
vita,3dntfc,Anotherhito,2,Fri Jul 17 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"I know i'm late to the game here but here's my take.  Personally, I got bored of Noire pretty quick. The battles are more like puzzles. you have to navigate the map in a specific way to reach your enemies. This would be fine on its own, except you are encouraged to replay levels a lot in order to get items and resources.  So it's kinda like solving a puzzle, then having to redo it a bunch more times, the exact same way. without the fun of figuring out the puzzle, since you know it already."
vita,3dntfc,thebamfs01,3,Sat Jul 18 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this comment, I was on the fence about getting it but now ill just get RB2 instead. I'll play FE for my SRPG needs until I get disgaea."
vita,3dntfc,pben95,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:10:43 2015 UTC,"yeah I was bummed when i didn't enjoy it. I love SRPGs and Nep Nep, but the two just didn't mix well."
vita,3dntfc,thebamfs01,2,Sat Jul 18 04:14:35 2015 UTC,Thanks I just bought rebirt2
vita,3dntfc,Anotherhito,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I have yet to get further in Noire because at the time I had got it, I also got Disgaea 3, 4 and HDN R2. (Currently doing R2 and then will get around to Noire)  The game itself is filled with a lot of fan service, the player character is not Noire but supposed to repersent the player, a male who has wondered into Lastation to find work and bumps into Noire after some stuff happens and she hires him as her Secretary. So, if you get it expect a lot of fan service in a more direct manner.  The UI and such are over all well done for the game itself and I never had many complaints. I did find as another person said the maps are puzzles in a sense and so to get everything you need to think on the best route. As well as the characters you have, especially early on and in comparison to SRPGs such as Disgaea are very very over powered. I was able to steam roll basically though the first two chapters no trouble.  The characters themselves are wide and varied, most are rather entertaining that I have met so far in the game. And like other Nep Nep titles the characters for their quotes, personality and humor is enough for me to want to replay though all the battles and such as I find it adorable. But I know that doesn't apply to everyone.   Sooo, for a TL;DR summery I recommend this game over all especially if you are a fan already of the nepnep games and are A,) New to SRPGs or looking for something simpler and not much of a challenge. and/or B.) You don't mind a lot of fan service sent in the players direction.  It's not the greatest SRPG out there (Disgaea has it beat in that category) but it is a rather decent and solid game over all and well... for a first attempt into the SPRG genre with the series they did a fairly decent job with it.  Edit: Forgot some enters"

vita,3dntfc,Histirea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"I'll use my very seductive argument from last month.  Take it from someone who's been enjoying regular doses of Nep Nep since it was first on the PS3.  It's an 8/10. Easily a 9/10 if you consider it more like a visual novel with a bit of dungeon crawling thrown in.  On that note, dungeon crawling is kind of mediocre, but that's the only bad thing I can say about the series in its entirety. (Except the first game on the PS3. That thing was a fucking train wreck outside of the script.)  Characters are fun and likable, dialogue is great, storyline is enjoyable, and it's not a particularly heavy grind like many JRPGs thanks to the use of Plans (which can make things easier or more challenging, as well as create items and costumes).  Plenty of video game and anime culture references, along with others that you may pick up on as you play through the game.  Do not expect there to be a fourth wall in Gamindustri. It never existed, and it never will.  The battle system is a well-balanced mix of turn-based and action RPG, with multiple relevant attack combinations. Each type of attack (Rush, Power and Break) is genuinely useful. You won't really find yourself button mashing, which is always welcome.  It's just that you have to get past the fact that the dungeon crawling itself, which you shouldn't be spending much time doing, isn't very good. One of the problems everyone complains about is that assets are reused in excess. It's true. However, like I said, you shouldn't be spending much time in dungeons in the first place.  tl;dr it'll be the best six bucks you've ever spent."

vita,3dntfc,rindindin,3,Sat Jul 18 03:12:21 2015 UTC,Hyper Dimension Neptunia Rebirth1 is practically a STEAL at that price. Do it.
vita,3dntfc,Satioelf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you like JRPGs go for Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1. For 6 bucks it is a steal. (On my PC copy which was basically a direct port I have put about 105 hours into it and I am still not 100% done of it... but that is mostly because i like messing around)   The combat in it is fairly standard, nothing too big or different from some other games, I personally love listening to the quotes the characters have and watching the attacks but I know a lot of people have them turned off so the game goes by faster.   As for plot, it is actually pretty light hearted over all and personally the characters really grew on me. Plot is rather straight forward, Nep-nep loses memory, wants to get memory back, needs to gather things to save the world and get said memory.   And also of course the main attraction to the game for me is the comedy in it and references. They make gaming and anime jokes quite often though out the game as well as different enemies being direct references to gaming or anime.  That being said, in comparison to Rebirth 2 wheres the plot was a lot more serious, it still had its funny moments... but just over all the plot just felt... wrong on a nepnep game. Still a fun game over all with lots of humor and such but.... there is a lot less insanity when Nepgear is the main character then when Nep-Nep was. Still another relatively solid JRPG with a lot of the same mechanics as Rebirth 1 as the rebirth games are remakes of the orginal games but using the better combat system from the 3rd game.  Most of the other games on the list I can not really speak about except the Hyperdeviotion Noire game, but... well, I made another post about that one and can point it out later if you wanna know more about it."

vita,3dntfc,KurumiAkai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"its pretty 50/50 with those choices. Re birth2 is known to be a bit lackluster compared to the first and even gets made fun of in the latest game because of the protagonist of it. Where as if you go for Noire, do so because you just want a bit different game play in the Neptunia world, and not because you really like SRPGs because its not that great as one. Its a fun game still"
vita,3dntfc,Luminous083,2,Fri Jul 17 23:21:17 2015 UTC,"Re;Birth 2 is honestly not a bad game at all. Even in the Neptunia world they make fun of Nepgear (The main character of RB2) all the time. She sees herself as dull and average compared to everyone around her despite what others say. She also isnt very sure of herself as a CPU candidate which is developed in the RB2 story.  So its not that the game is so bad their other games make fun of it, think of it more as a play on the characters self made stereotype in game."

Like in rebirth I'm doing 4000 by bloke the third chapter but in noire you stuck doing 50 or 60 damage pr whatever.   It's a small nitpick but I like large damage numbers.

vita,3dntfc,KidReynolds,2,Sat Jul 18 02:55:32 2015 UTC,Is Hyper Dimension Neptunia good? I always liked RPGs and have been wanting to play a good game on my vita for a while.

PLEASE SEND HELP!!!  You have been warned.. but anyway, yes, it worth every penny.."
vita,3dntfc,Xero293,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:36:41 2015 UTC,If I get Neptunia for 6$ it will use up the last of my space for my tiny 8 GB memory card which would prevent me from playing any other potential games that would go on sale. My life is terrible

vita,3dntfc,SwiftCase,8,Fri Jul 17 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have something to say about Proteus? It looks interesting, but even $3.50 seems like a bit much for what it appears to be."
vita,3dntfc,Satanicapplesauce,2,Fri Jul 17 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"I am someone with rather severe depression and I play Proteus when I need to relax. It's incredibly calming to explore, and listen to the music. If you have a lot of stress, or just need to unwind occasionally, I recommend it wholeheartedly. If you want objectives, its probably not for you."

vita,3dntfc,Jack_Hat,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a game. you just walk around and look at shapes. there's nothing to the game. Just walk around. If you want to buy into the relaxing thing, go for it. But personally, I find going to sleep more fun."
vita,3dntfc,Corrivatus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"I have it for pc, so I can't speak on performance issues or anything. But the game is an atmospheric adventure game. It's more art than game.   For 3.50 it's not bad, but it's not something you'll dump hours into, unless you like aimlessly wandering around looking at scenery and listening to music.   As art, I'd give it an 8/10, as a game, well there isn't much there."

From the people behind guacamelee.  You start of as a small blob who is escaping form a science lab.  You need to eat stuff to grow, so you slide around rolling into things, growing bit by bit so that you can escape the lab.  Eventually you become large enough that you become a threat, so the humans start attacking you, which is where it becomes really fun."

vita,3dntfc,bluEfya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:06:21 2015 UTC,Amazing if you like challenging games. Loads of levels and things to unlock. I play it pretty much daily even if its for one level. Look up a video for a feel of the gameplay but I'd say buy at this price.

You have so much control over each of your character movements that you feel extremely accomplished when you plan out a perfect turn.  That said, online play is deserted, so I wouldn't get it if multiplayer is important to you."

vita,3dntfc,TheGermishGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 22:01:59 2015 UTC,What's the character class system like in Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1? Do characters just have a set skill progression or is there any way to customize character progression?
vita,3dntfc,Inferis84,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:16 2015 UTC,It's just set progression. No customization other than equipment.
vita,3dntfc,TheGermishGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 20:54:44 2015 UTC,Thanks. Guess I won't pick it up then. Set progression never appealed to me.
vita,3dntfc,lilbear10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"I really think you should try nep1. For the price its a good way to test it. The game is great. It's funny, tons of game references and content."

vita,3dntfc,TheGermishGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:30 2015 UTC,Sounds promising. Are the individual characters' progressions different or does it feel like there's a few character tropes dressed up in different skins?
vita,3dntfc,BroDuck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:09:13 2015 UTC,Thank god I'm super broke or else I'd own both HDN Re;Birth 2 and Hyperdevotion Noire too. No need for my backlog to increase so much ;-;

I was a little overly optimistic expecting Lumines to go as low as 2.50, but I also wasn't planning to see Txk go on sale (after all the licensing issues).  Am I SOL? Anyone care to help a brotha out?    EDIT: TxK is fantastic by the way, 100% worth it at the 10 dollar price tag, a steal at 2 bucks. You can feel the love put into the game, really just beautifully made"

vita,3dqfkp,PerfectlyHonest,0,Sat Jul 18 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"While I'm happy to finally see an idolm@ster on Vita, this is not what I was expecting. This is super lazy — just looks like a big DLC for Taiko V while they could've made a proper Shiny Festa 2. Taiko isn't good for a franchise that relies heavily on characters & visuals, as customization only goes as far as a reskin. I know they said they wanted to focus on the PS4's title so making this choice is understandable, I just hope it won't prevent an actual imas game to exist on the Vita. (Although I'm certainly eager to be able to remote play the next game!)"

They may be issuing vouchers that will let you re-acquire the game once it’s sorted out. I can follow up with you as soon as we know more! Sorry for the inconvenience.

Now I'm waiting for a refund which should be in next 3-5 days.  I hope many of you will get it to made Sony pay attention to such issues.

Alas, no overworld (unique to EO4) but has advanced and basic party configurations you see in untold. Spiritually, I would say Demon Gaze.

Danganronpa's characters aren't particularly shallow unlike most large-cast murder mysteries are, but they're basically well-fleshed tropes.  The plot of persona is not as airtight and engaging as steins gate, but the latter is basically a novel so it makes sense the plot is the major driving force of the game."

vita,3dp5fd,shizknight,4,Sat Jul 18 03:59:48 2015 UTC,Steins;gate is a bit of a slow burn on character development.  Probably because the story is actually fairly involved.  But after chapter 5 ends you probably won't be able to put it down.

vita,3dtdti,BlamelessVestalsLot,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"The genre has to do with stat-based character progression not roleplaying.   the time, they lack the entire ""role-playing"" aspect of it? You aren't really making any choices....it's just a fairly linear storyline or quests, that you cannot really influence much if at all     Just like the early (western) RPGs that influenced that influenced the Japanese developed RPGs. Where Western developers branched out Eastern developers for the most part stuck to the formula that made them fall in love with the genre, that's why your typical Japanese developed/Console styled turn-based RPGs as a whole have barely evolved since their inception.   Most things that would be a feature of an RPG aren't really there in these games, stuff like improving stats    They do though, unless you mean manually in that case not every Western developed RPG has that either.     even learning new skills is mostly automated and pre-determined.

So technically can't any game be a Role Playing game? For you play the role of someone else in a different realty. For example, i won't ever join the army, but i can play the role of a navy officer in Cod or something to experience life in war. But that is a more narrow way of looking at it. What about a more abstract broad rpg, where i create my character, lets say a cold hearted mercenary female, who is strong willed but is stubborn. Ill create that char. In Mmo's or in RPG titles like Skyrim and play out their roles.  Edit: Well the point is ""What is an RPG?"" how do you define it in your opinion?  I study psychology and we learned that every vocab word has a literal definition and a personal definition, what means something to me may mean something else to someone else. The phychological and literal definition of ""RP"" ""Is the acting out or performance of a particular role, either consciously (as a technique in psychotherapy or training) or unconsciously, in accordance with the perceived expectations of society with regard to a person's behavior in a particular context."" -Sources being Google  So lets take a further look at  "" unconsciously, in accordance with the perceived expectations of society with regard to a person's behavior in a particular context.""  In JRP's that you mentioned aren't you basically roleplaying the lives of the characters under your control living out the lives in context of what the creater/developer written for your enjoyment?"
vita,3dtdti,LoSouLibra,0,Sun Jul 19 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"This has been an age old contention that's been around since the first console rpgs existed. Dragon Quest was attempting to streamline the computer rpg experience for a two button console in the early 80's with limited memory and no rewriteability, created it's own archetype and other console rpgs from Japan followed in it's footsteps. It's been an enjoyable concept for nearly 3 decades and nobody that's familiar with many types of rpgs or set in their ways has ever cared. It's just like how nobody really cares that Super Smash Bros isn't as complicated or layered with traditional command/combo/move inputs as Street Fighter etc is."
vita,3dtdti,KilledByVen,-5,Sun Jul 19 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"The general problem is a lot of people are confused with what a genre actually is, and to be honest, it's hard to not blame them given that there are thousands of ""sub genres"" because people who review games feel if something is slightly different to the norm, it doesn't fit in the category altogether.  In short; the majority of ""RPG"" games are actually classified as action games, an example of this would be Tales of Hearts R (to anyone hoping to jump me regarding this, sure it has RPG elements, however they have no contrast to the linear story. At best you could classify it as an Action-RPG) opposed to an actual RPG such as nearly anything made by BioWare (and again, no jumping, aware that Mass Effect is debatable as a standalone RPG, due to the third person shooter aspect)  A true RPG is any game where the story is in the hands of the gamer, with clearly contrasting choices.

vita,3dl8ws,rutherne,24,Fri Jul 17 04:29:31 2015 UTC,Usually consoles at shows/conventions/etc are pretty heavily attached to whatever display they're at. I'm surprised someone could just make off with it.

vita,3dl8ws,Neuchacho,5,Fri Jul 17 14:03:37 2015 UTC,Exactly sometimes the best way to steal stuff is in plain sight because its unexpected. At a convention people assume since theres so many people that no ones going too take something they let their guard down. No loss for atlus only thing is they will watch their gear closer from now on.
vita,3dl8ws,peterkozmd,0,Fri Jul 17 14:16:07 2015 UTC,I've personally heard from several shop owners that conventions are literally the biggest money loss for them because of how much merch disappears.

vita,3dl8ws,Rainingmadness,-12,Fri Jul 17 11:07:30 2015 UTC,? Not really uncommon not every company locks down their stuff even at conventions. They probably have quite a few and its just taken out of their budget as cost of business they dont look at it as a 200 buck system vs more like something they get for free from work.   That said they dont treat these systems like high security items. They are showing games remember. Its not unheard of to have the mentality its just games we are showing. Also its a vita not some brand new prototype ps4 or x1 prior to release.   Stop acting like they are constantly watching their stuff like a hawk. Same thing with airports alot of hustle and activity going on easy to get distracted

vita,3dnjyu,razisgosu,4,Fri Jul 17 23:51:49 2015 UTC,"i'm blaming Atlus (and NISA, and every other complicit eastern developer whose games I love) for not standing up to this bullshit and saying, ""We move the console, you move out of the way.""     Why would Atlus do that? It's a vocal minority that keeps bringing this subject up. If someone were to start a petition it'd have to be the consumers, not the publishers."
vita,3dnjyu,BlamelessVestalsLot,2,Fri Jul 17 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about the Vita dying because they don't allow AO; I'm talking about when they stop classifying Japanese games on the Vita because the localizers stop censoring them, the Vita stops having any releases outside of indie titles to begin with.  i'm blaming Atlus (and NISA, and every other complicit eastern developer whose games I love) for not standing up to this bullshit and saying, ""We move the console, you move out of the way.""   I don't even know what you are trying to say with that first paragraph.   Atlus and NISA doin't have the power to overthrow Sony's rules. Without Sony's authorization, Atlus and NISA can't release on their platform at all. Sony has made it very clear they do not want pornographic content or AO in general on their platform. Atlus and NISA do not have any room to say ""well, we're going to get an AO rating and release anyway"" it wouldn't be allowed."

Both of those were originally PSP releases. Then Dungeon Travelers 2 got a Vita port in Japan. That came out and sold well, so the publisher announced a direct sequel and a port of the first game. Presumably if DT2 sells well on Vita in the west Atlus will pick up the first game's port."

My first thought was that its the charger fault, so I went to my friend and borrowed his charger and battery just in case. I plugged in his charger to my PSP but it still didnt want to charge. I decided to swap batteries. Suprisingly my PSP didnt want to turn on with his battery but my friend said it was charged. At this point I realized that it might not be just battery/charger issue. I also plugged in charger while I had his battery but still no orange light. With sad face I put my PSP away. I still tried to charge it every now and then for few months but it never worked. After about a year I decided to give it another shot. I plug charger to PSP and woooosh! Orange Light! My heart started beating faster. After few minutes of charging I started PSP and it booted. It came from the dead. It worked. It still works to this day. Such awesome piece of hardware."

It's a good game, but they don't really give you tutorials and you'll need to read through the help section to learn some of the mechanics.  I'd agree that Demon Gaze is a really good intro to DRPGs for Vita; but, if you happen to have a 3ds, the Etrian Odyssey games would be even better."

Any chance for some of the others (like Stranger of Sword City) getting localized?"
vita,3dl0ez,julioangelortiz,3,Fri Jul 17 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"As much as I like this genre. I haven't purchased any on the Vita because I'm not really into the fanservice these games provide. Operation Abyss seems like it could be closest to my tastes, but I'm kind of turned away by that it has less of a focus on grinding and more of a focus on crafting which I'm not really a big fan of in video games. Give me a game with as much grinding as Dragon Quest in a DRPG style and I'll be set for a very long time.    Stranger of Sword City looks really cool, but is there going to be a localization of that in the West?"
vita,3dl0ez,Shentok,4,Fri Jul 17 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"Demon Gaze has some fanservice but it's fairly light. It definitely has what you want in an RPG with moderate grinding though.  Operation Abyss focuses more on equipment than leveling for feeling powerful, but the crafting is pretty trivial and doesn't require you to particularly hunt down ingredients. It's still RNG based in what weapons you can craft, but you'll have the materials for them.  We have no news of localizations of the other games yet, but I'm sure SoSC is coming, given the success of Demon Gaze and depending on how well OA does (they're all Experience games)"

vita,3dl0ez,Touka,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"I just started playing Demon Gaze. I really like Etrian Odyssey series, so that's maybe why there are some things I don't particularly like about Demon Gaze:   The UIs for the game. I don't know, they're just...not that good? Some of them are good, but I particularly don't like the item/weapon description (not clear enough which weapons are stronger). The quests system. I'm still at the beginning, but not only they don't give you the slightest hints, but there are huge amount of quests that I cannot finish right away. It's a bit frustrating getting so many quests that you can't finish, let alone have any idea how to finish. Compare to EO series which constantly give you quests that you can take and finish straight away, giving you better sense of accomplishment. Dungeons are okay I guess, but is there no way to map the hazardous floors without walking onto them? Sometimes I look at the map and I go ""Oh, I haven't explored those areas"" only to find out that those are hazardous floors. Character customizations (or the lack of them). Battles are okay. It's pretty similar to EO series, except for one thing. Enemies can just change positions or call reinforcements etc for no reasons at all which makes the battles sometimes annoying instead of challenging.   I'm interested in Operation Abyss though. Do my complaints about Demon Gaze also apply to Operation Abyss?"
vita,3dl0ez,benhanks040888,2,Sat Jul 18 06:20:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten around to OA yet, but I would like to respond to your points about DG.   I can agree with this. The game doesn't indicate when something is stronger than what you have on (e.g. via arrows/color coding), so you end up just scrolling through the list looking for a bigger number. A particular gripe of mine is that sorting your inventory sorts everything by grade instead of by effect, which results in total waste of space items like those ""heal 15-30 hp"" foods (which you still get well into endgame) being scattered apart instead of all close together for easy disposal. 100 inventory slots is way too small when you're getting 3 nonstacking items from every demon circle in addition to whatever other trash you happen to acquire. There are two long-running collection quests that will take you until postgame to fully complete (mushrooms and skulls; don't bother until postgame with a guide handy). Just about every other quest is straightforward, the majority of which are simply ""talk to this NPC"" once you accept them. The amount of quests you get quickly trickles down to a few related directly to game progression after that initial rush of introductory quests. The third demon (second dungeon) gives immunity to hazardous floors when you have her equipped. You'll get another slot at level 10, so having her at all times in dungeons with hazards isn't a huge sacrifice. There is an artifact system to grant abilities from other classes, but you're right in that there isn't much customization beyond that. Every class has fairly obvious optimal stats to pump level bonuses into, so customization there is basically ""do you want benefit from this stat point or just waste it?"" Random battles for the most part are just mindless autobattle fodder. This is especially true with a samurai or slash artifacts, which can clear out multiple rows of enemies in just a couple turns at no cost. There are a few random enemies that will shake things up but you learn to manage them, even if it means using your fog staff to bail out instead of holding triangle. I do appreciate that autobattle remembers commands instead of just making everyone do basic attacks."
vita,3dl0ez,No_Post_History,2,Sat Jul 18 08:50:59 2015 UTC,I'm somewhat interested in Moe Chronicles but I'm wondering what kind of 2lewd4u bits are there.  The way Monpiece implemented the touch game irritated the hell out of me by having to run through the motions every time you had a card to upgrade to the next rank.
vita,3dl0ez,Taedirk,6,Fri Jul 17 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"the touch mini game is pretty annoying, its a fun game with tons of cool classes and dungeons but you have to go through that part everytime you beat a boss/capture a new member.

vita,3dl0ez,TheRedCometX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"Some are, but a lot of newer DRPGs aren't quite as focused on that, and tend to either directly cap your leveling (Operation Abyss) or limit how much power you actually obtain from levels (Demon Gaze).  DRPGs tend to be designed around resource management, as your ability to regain HP/MP is usually limited, so grinding can occasionally (but not always) allow you to avoid struggling with resources."

vita,3dne0z,MasterInterface,2,Fri Jul 17 18:18:13 2015 UTC,I agree. Everyday the PS3 version isn't out in English is another day its sales potential lessens. They have a very obscure game that they're releasing on last gen hardware as a digital-only title. It needed to be out six months ago.

Sony isn't as big as a company it use to be, so your thought of ""they want to make a profit everywhere, not just in Japan"" doesn't work right now.  I believe they had a $2 Billion loss last year?  They're in no position to release a Vita successor, they've focused all their resources on the PS4, they don't have the resources to think about a Vita successor.

But i see where it can affect online stores such as amazon, as far as best buy i have seen very few vita games on shelves but they sell alot of accessories and Vita's itself, but that's only from the bestbuys in my area.  Edit: I also find it alittle more likely for them to just pull the plug if they wanted to on the vita given they   how Psp Go was a failure and they dropped that fairly quickly, but i don't know very much on PsPgo so i could be wrong."

I agree with the L2/R2 being needed if they create another handheld, but I don't want L3/R3 on any handheld, ever.  Now, you may think I'm crazy but let me explain. What is the first part of a controller that typically fails/breaks? The thumbsticks. The more moving parts you have on a handheld device, the more likely it is to have something break.   While it's entirely possible they could create a way to make the thumbsticks hold up longer, replacing an entire system because your thumbstick broke is a lot more expensive than replacing your controller."

vita,3dqjm5,Sasuke082594,0,Sun Jul 19 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"Tablets and smartphones have taken a huge chunk out of the handheld market all over the world. The 3DS and Vita have each sold a fraction of what their predecessors sold in the same amount of time.  There's a simple reason for it: handhelds are a diversion device for most of their target audience. They're taken on trips, played while the TV is being used, played while waiting for restaurant seating, etc. that function, for the most part, has been overtaken by parents who just hand their kid their smartphone while they wait.  What's left of the market is comprised primarily of a few people beholden by nostalgia and the true handheld gamers who appreciate the experiences that generally only appear on handhelds. It's a comparatively small number of potential buyers.  Because of this, Nintendo seems to be shifting gears and going ""full mobile,"" whatever that might entail. With few exceptions (Pokemon comes to mind), their main IPs have been fully featured on both the console and handheld side. Sony attempted this early in the Vita's life cycle (Uncharted, Killzone, etc), but then quickly ceased support, likely because they saw that AAA IPs didn't do much to move units...especially when those units had an adoption cost of over 400 USD (unit - 250 minimum, memory card - 40 minimum, game - 30 minimum). To add insult to injury, Nintendo had just instituted its ambassador program in addition to dropping the price on the 3DS, a device that uses a standard memory format, was giving (multiple) games away for free with purchase, and cost 50 USD less than the bare wifi Vita.  Given the option, more of the tech- and price-savvy remains of their former total market (handheld gamers) opted for the better value with the knowledge that it wouldn't be long before a price drop based on Sony's idiotic (albeit not unexpected) pricing and memory format decisions.  Honestly, there likely isn't anything that Sony can do to be a success on handhelds in the west. If the rumors about the NX are true, all of that great Nintendo IP will only be available on a tablet-like gaming device, and Sony's business practices with regards to pricing and proprietary formats simply won't allow them to compete in the same area.  Basically, they're incapable of not shooting themselves in the foot (again), and I think they know that.  Also, Sony has traditionally supported their devices with at least firmware updates for 7+ years...so we have a few years yet."

vita,3dqjm5,Typhlops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"Visually yes, but PSP had vastly superior functionality. Hardware wise the USB port and TV out are huge advantages (especially since the new 3ds has the SD card slot locked behind a panel which requires a screwdriver) multimedia functionality, psn (cross buy in particular, especially for ps1 games) connectivity with ps3 (remote play, the ps3 can act as a big harddrive for PSP) and that's ignoring psp go which could use ps3 controllers  (Granted vita doesn't have TV out or dualshock support unless you get the VitaTV which has its own set of problems)"
vita,3dqjm5,Neo_Techni,2,Sat Jul 18 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right on all of those fronts, and I will stand by the fact that PSP was way ahead of it's time. I never personally owned it, but I bought Chinatown Wars recently on my Vita and apart from the resolution it could have easily passed as a Vita-native PSN game. Problem is that in the smartphone-age, no handheld is gonna compete with my HTC One, and honestly beyond gaming I can do everything faster/easier on my phone, so I just aim for being able to play my games and can settle for that. From what I've heard the NX might just tackle a fair few issues you've named, but honestly a Nintendo device with Vita graphics would already satisfy me big time."
vita,3dqjm5,Typhlops,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I recently got a Galaxy S5, and sadly now my PSP is now almost redundant past UMD games. Even then, I could easily emulate those games now.   The Vita and 3DS are still viable as their games stand on their own and are not capable, or at least are not as good as on their own respective system's hardware. But most of the multimedia functions on each are not useful, except maybe the Vita's ability to play music during games and it's PSN capabilities."

I bought it for $5 on close out from local store, but about $9 is a pretty good price too.  Only super lame thing about it is that it does not come with it's own cable, and you have to use the one that came with the Vita.  At the lower price point, this is tolerable!"

If you're not in a hurry to buy games, I'd suggest this weekly trial of patience to save some money on games.  The best one is the flash sale. I got some seriously good prices, like ps1 titles at .49 cents and katamary damacy for something like 3 dollars."

vita,3dowf1,Alex_The_Redditor,2,Sat Jul 18 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"The graphics are not as good as the PS2 version but the game runs at a really solid high frame rate. It is missing a few maps, Death Star and a few others, and features. The biggest missing features are no campaign, which is replaced by some trivial hunting missions across a couple of characters, and no ship interiors which means no boarding enemy ships and destroying them from the inside though there is some limited access to the interior. Don't get me wrong it's still awesome though and one of my favorite quick match of first person/third person shooting on vita. At only $2 it's a steal so go for it if you can, I bought it at $20 and don't regret it. Also check out the other battlefronts on vita if you like 2, elite squadron and renegade squadron, they're packed with a lot more features.   Sorry if I got ranty I'm a huge nerd about these games at $2 just go for it."

Unlike crunchy roll, they don't censor everything to high hell and give you the option of watching something dubbed.  They also stream shows that are currently airing and all that jazz.  As a side note, anime studios don't care about western viewership of their shows. Only japanese blueay sales, so you aren't really doing the shows any kind of diservice because the japanese just don't care what their western audience thinks (hence shows like Watamote that did extremely well in the west will never get more seasons because the Japanese viewers didn't like it)."

vita,3dkwn1,Regrehtful,0,Fri Jul 17 07:15:58 2015 UTC,"Anime studios not caring about western audiences isn't true. Anime have been made because of western audiences being vocal. Its unlikely but has happened before. Also, you are doing the show a disservice by streaming it with no gain to the anime industry in anyway. To add on to my earlier point about the anime studios, the Watamote manga would have ended by now if not for the western audience, the only reason its getting an anime as well is because of the west and I don't understand how a show can do ""extremely well"" without any western sales numbers backing the claim at all. In my opinion Watamote was a bad show with shitty humor and plot, though the OP was great."

I remember getting excited after Sony countered Nintendo's Theme Update for the 3DS with and update of their own, but it seems it was nothing more than an excuse to for them to say ""we can do it too!"".  They've made like, 5 official ones and have no quality control for what devs with put on the store. Totally blows.  EPIC DEATH DEALER/GREEN STREAM THEME"
vita,3do71y,wyze511,2,Sat Jul 18 07:22:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty simple.   They apply to be a PS developer, and if they are approved they get dev kits and the SDK and make themes."

vita,3do71y,smthomasmit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:29:32 2015 UTC,"The issue is that I don't want to buy a theme. I just wanted to see if I could make a theme of my own that match my own interests.

vita,3do32f,unlimitedends,4,Fri Jul 17 21:12:37 2015 UTC,If you are new to the series I would recommend starting with RB1.   Hyperdevotion Noire is a game meant for those who are into SRPG's as well as those who love the character Noire from the Neptunia series.   Rebirth 1 is a remake/reboot of the original Neptunia that came out on PS3. It assumes you know nothing about the game and will allow you to get a feel for the game and its story. If you are unsure of picking it up I wrote a review awhile back for the game that you can take a look at as well.  Its worth noting that you can play Noire without having played any of the Re;Birth series since they are not connected at all. Its also worth noting that the story of RB1 is set in its own timeline as well. RB2 and RB3 however have a connected storyline. Hope that helps give you an idea of the differences between the two. If you end up having questions about either title you choose to pick up feel free to check out /r/gamindustri. Plenty of people over there are willing to help out those with questions.
vita,3do32f,Luminous083,2,Fri Jul 17 21:25:02 2015 UTC,I just read your review and the remake system sounds pretty awesome =)  Is it carried over into the subsequent games in the series?
vita,3do32f,ishkabibbel2000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"The system itself is present in all of the Re;Birth games but changes made through the system are tied to their respective games. RB3 actually added more ideas onto the system as well. Someone was curious about some of the changes that were present in RB3 over the other Nep games. Ill link my response here if you are curious about that as well.  ""Ive finished 2/3 of the endings for RB3 and this is what Ive noticed.   Stellas Dungeon (Added originally in RB2) has been tweaked and adjusted and now gives you more reason to actually do it. It rewards special plans that you can use in the remake system. They also added companion characters to Stellas Dungeon and they offer additional benefits to make clearing floors easier as well as finding items. SP/EXE gauge have been consolidated into one bar. This allows you to play very differently than you would before and allows you to use many more team compositions than you could before without gimping the team. Awakened. Basically this is a mode that is similar to HDD for non-CPU characters. The goal in mind with this change was to allow you to use non-CPUs and not feel as gimped as you were previously. So again, more options as far as party compositions. Dungeons. While alot of the dungeons are similar or copies of other dungeons from the Nep series they are notably bigger than previous games. Some have more to run around in while some have added a level of verticality to them. Item Searching. The game has finally added a feature that has been a real pain for alot of the other Nep games and that is the ability to look up in game where a certain material drops from. For a long time you needed the help of a master list compiled by others but with this addition that is no longer needed.   These are most of the changes I can remember off the top of my head. If you are looking for more answers or possibly more in depth answers you should probably check out the nep reddit. People are always willing to help out those who are interested."""

vita,3do32f,Blazephantom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:11 2015 UTC,"Eh stay far from Devotion if you are new to the series. The combat gets stale quick and the chibi models are sort of offputting too (IMO). It's also a spin off unlike RB1, which is a remake of the 1st PS3 game.   I've played EVERY HDN on Vita and PP & Devotion are definitely the worse, with RB2 close behind due to its poor story. Anyway, only buy RB1, not Devotion."

vita,3di07i,mibuwolf,-4,Thu Jul 16 21:55:23 2015 UTC,"No? Just like any other language you have grammar, vocab. , and writing/listening is sort of optional. In every language as far as I can tell you should be able to learn a language well enough to communication through reading just by learning grammar and vocab.  The listening and writing is difficult no matter what language you try to learn, however the Chinese writing system is quite a hurdle. However, keep in mind these two things are only necessary if you plan to do quick day-to-day communication using the language or conduct business in some fashion.  In most cases you are able to just whip out a dictionary and just pronounce the word you want with some grammar thrown in and 'Voila!' you have a sentence. Reading shouldn't be much different.

Who are these hordes of people buying games and then throwing out the packaging before reselling it?  Why do you do this if you like to resell your games?

vita,3di07i,Banana_Kama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the store.  The Gamestop in Herald Square doesn't even have a full wall section for vita, it's just on side of a small column.  The one in the Manhattan mall hasn't had any Vita games the last few times I've been.  The one off Union Square and the one at 86th and Lexington consistently have a full wall display for Vita, at the least.  The best selection I've seen has been at the Bronx Terminal Mall store, but that one also had the highest concentration of crazy, shouting customers.  Even within a major city like NYC you see a huge variance.  The big thing that kills it for me and makes me want to just order from Amazon instead is that the majority of Vita games they sell are used, in those ugly white dust-jackets.  It wouldn't be so bad if they game you a discount for not including the original packaging, but it pisses me off that you can usually find the same game listed for the same price or cheaper with all the actual packaging.    Also, once you've picked up the Vita heavy hitters, P4G, FFX/X-2, Freedom Wars, etc, they tend not to have anything new for you."

vita,3dmviq,ChaosZeroX,4,Fri Jul 17 15:44:27 2015 UTC,Walking Dead 1 is the easiest - just play the game and beat it.  Wolf Among Us is pretty easy. One playthrough plus cleanup that could take an hour or so.  Resistance: Burning Skies. I think the multiplayer is still active but I got the plat after one play through and a little online.
vita,3dmviq,julioangelortiz,3,Fri Jul 17 16:10:32 2015 UTC,Gravity Rush isn't the easiest.  I'd say Jak and Daxter Precurser Legacy or Resistance Burning Skies are easiest.

vita,3dmviq,Neo_Techni,3,Sat Jul 18 15:07:08 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Senran Kagura:SV is one of the easiest on the system. You get almost all of them by just playing through the game.
vita,3dmviq,Luminous083,3,Fri Jul 17 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Stay away from time consuming ones, you'll likely lose interest.

Sound Shapes isn't that bad - though your mileage may vary with the death mode trophies. (Plus, you can auto-pop all trophies for the PS3 and PS4 versions if you own those consoles.)  The LEGO games are extremely easy - particularly Batman 3 and Jurassic World."

vita,3dmviq,Malgas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:03:41 2015 UTC,Gravity Rush is reasonably simple. Some tricky ones but nothing too tough. It's mostly the challenges that you might have trouble with.  Tearaway wasn't too hard either but some of the platforming ones were annoying.

vita,3dnb10,jnmaniac,0,Fri Jul 17 17:47:06 2015 UTC,Id say sonic racing on Wii u is ahead of Mario kart 8 because it treats the gamepad as it's own screen instead of mirroring the main one on it
vita,3dnb10,Neo_Techni,5,Sat Jul 18 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"For me it is Need for Speed Most Wanted for the Vita. It's the only racing game that I could play for ages and not get bored like the others. Therefore, it's my go-to racing game if I have awhile to kill. With multi-player, lots of challenges, unlocks (cars and kits) and free-roam it keeps me entertained!  My arcade racer is Sonic All Stars, quickly hope into a race, good graphics and it's the closest thing I'll get to Mario Kart on the Vita personally. Great tracks, consistent frame rate and a lot of variety.   These are my personal opinions and recommendations. Others may or may not agree with me. Hope this helps!"

It's light on content but it plays really well and is gorgeous, still one of the prettiest vita games. The HD FURY dlc is also brilliant - not as good as the PS3 version, but I would say that the original game is one of the best racing games ever made in my book.  I just really want Sony to put 2097 and Wip3out on the store, those games are easily better than 2048 and still play, sound and look good."

I'm not sure about Silent Hill, but Metal Gear Solid 1 cannot be downloaded directly onto a PS Vita.

vita,3dma6t,MonthOLDpickle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"Terraria is more about combat, exploring and creating. Now yea gonna say but Minecraft is too! Minecraft is really about building and being immersed in the world. In all sense Terraria is more structured. Terraria takes Minecraft's open & free form creativity and throws in more game like elements. Item progression is apparent in both (as is tiered ore, etc), but Terraria's item progression is far more pronounced when it comes to importance. Armour for example, it is helpful in Minecraft while in Terraria it is actually important for your survival. Look at combat, In Minecraft you don't need it. You can play the game without hitting one (or turn them off). IN Terraria, you need drops. Without you actually can not progress. The strive to progress, to get better and fight tougher enemies is what makes Terraria a great game.  So if you like exploring, character growth and combat, Terraria. Minecraft is a great tool for imagination though.  There is a demo, it is hard to explain. I have Terraria for the PC with over 200 hours and waiting to go to the states to get the physical copy for vita."

It takes a long time to translate a game like Dragon Quest VII. Here's the entire script for the original Japanese PSX version of the game. That's around 60 volumes of game text in Japanese.

vita,3dgps6,InYourHands,58,Thu Jul 16 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm the one that said this via our Twitter. So maybe I should clarify myself a little?  UE3 doesn't natively support Vita. From my understanding EPIC put in some of the code to support the system but never finished it. So it's up to a lot of developers to build the code base to make the engine run on platform at all. Once that is done we'll have to port GS into it, now GS is a very physics every game, in order to work on the Vita we'd have to downgrade it massively in order to work. This will include all new 3D models (Character, Vehicles, Environments, LOTS of Props) and textures.  This would be a massive undertaking for any studio to do, let alone a Indie developer/publisher such as ourselves. However, we love the Vita, we created a number of games for the Vita since our Foundering starting with LittleBigPlanet Vita and would love to eventually bring Goat Simulator to the Vita if the demand is there.  So if you want it on the Vita, I recommend asking Sony, Coffee Stain and ourselves via Twitter for Goat Simulator on the Vita.  D.Arquette - Community Manager and QA Tester @ Double Eleven.    As a side note and backer of IGA's new game, Bloodstained, I can't wait for that game and I think it's amazing once they've done the Vita port they're going to share the finished code. This can only mean that eventually more games will be coming to the Vita."
vita,3dgps6,D11_Darquette,8,Thu Jul 16 07:24:51 2015 UTC,Perhaps you should start a crowd fund for the Vita version? I'd be happy to buy the game a third time :D (already got PC and Android)

I believe, and I may be wrong I've only heard it via this Reddit chat, that they used a completely different Engine (Unity) for the mobile version. If that is true, we'd probably be able to port that one quite easily, as Unity does support Vita among many things. Which, if that's the case, you'll need to get onto Sony, ourselves and Coffeestain asking for a Vita version.  D.Arquette - Community Manager and QA Tester @ Double Eleven."

It is now July, almost August, they need to let this game die known as an April Fool's joke and stop adding dumb dlc and porting it over to different systems."

vita,3dgps6,Martin15Sleith,-4,Thu Jul 16 09:01:55 2015 UTC,I really can't wait for Bloodstained to come out and see what excuses developers will then give.
vita,3dgps6,Neo_Techni,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:37 2015 UTC,It's not officially supported. The Bloodstained developers will have to do all the tweaking themselves without any customer support.
vita,3dgps6,SalomonG18,5,Thu Jul 16 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Armature is the one doing the job, and they've done a pretty great job of porting games like Metal Gear Solid to Vita. Chances that they'll make Bloodstained run at Unreal Engine 4 smoothly in the vita is fairly high, and they will share their method publicly after releasing it."
vita,3dgps6,diay1987,0,Thu Jul 16 04:54:00 2015 UTC,I just wish mgs hds controls didn't suck...
vita,3dl1lg,thadarkdefender,4,Fri Jul 17 03:19:41 2015 UTC,Nope.  You can only remote play to your primary PS4.  So you can remote play to your PS4 or you can share your purchases with your brother.  Not both.
vita,3dl1lg,somehokie,2,Fri Jul 17 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"I use remote play on my sister ps4 just fine, didnt set it as my primary ps4."
vita,3dl1lg,exsinner,2,Fri Jul 17 06:26:46 2015 UTC,"Was it the first PS4 you logged into with you PSN account?  It so, it (usually) automatically sets it as primary.  Also, to set up remote play, unless they changed it in the last few months, requires you to go into the settings for remote play and copy a code, and before it gives you a code, it'll give you the option to set that PS4 as your primary, otherwise it will not let you connect except when you are local to it or on the same network.  If you connect to a non-primary PS4, you also do not get the option to start it up from standby, and apparently a few other limitations.  All-in-all, it seems from simple searches it seems like OP could connect his Vita to his PS4 at home, but only while at home."
vita,3dl1lg,somehokie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but something must have changed then. I've been using my vita on a non primary ps4 almost since I've gotten my vita. I clearly know it's not primary because I can see it in settings, also my second system is the primary one which it does not connect to. Also, there is no problem waking the console from standby or using from a different network. I'm not sure if it was always like this, but this is my setup for about a year now."
vita,3dl1lg,Jspectro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"I only have the official Sony guides for setting up Remote Play to go off on for a non-primary PS4.  Googling around seems to confirm what the guide says about only being able to wake up primary PS4s while on different networks, which to common sense makes sense, otherwise how would it decide which (primary or non-primary) to wake up and use.   I clearly know it's not primary because I can see it in settings, also my second system is the primary one which it does not connect to.   Which settings?  Do you mean Settings>PSN/Account Management>Activate as Your Primary PS4?  Have you ever remote played to your own PS4?  If you haven't, and your sister's PS4 is the only one you have connected to, that may be why this works."
vita,3dl1lg,somehokie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:49:48 2015 UTC,"Yep those are the settings I'm talking about. The option to activate is there but I haven't clicked it as the other one is already primary on my account. To my understanding only one ps4 and vita can be linked together. You can't have 2 ps4's setup to remote play, I believe that's why there is the option to change the ps4 console on the vita. This isn't the first time Sony guides have been wrong, or maybe they just haven't updated them yet."
vita,3dl1lg,Jspectro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:07:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I have to wonder if it's a loophole or if it's working as intended, and if it's the second if the guides are outdated or if they are trying to hide this to prevent game-sharing/unwanted behavior."
vita,3dl1lg,somehokie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe that yeah. I honestly think they confused primary ps4 with ""remote play ps4"" as I can't find any way to link 2 consoles."

vita,3dmhhq,nad45,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:51 2015 UTC,true. they should even remake grand turismo for psp for vita
vita,3dmhhq,GeneralChaz9,3,Fri Jul 17 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Hey man, go for it. I doubt it will go far though. Also...I am not a huge fan of TPS in all honesty. If it came to the Vita, I would get it because that would just be an awesome portable game instead of a console release."
vita,3dmhhq,wielku,3,Fri Jul 17 15:20:29 2015 UTC,I would rather want them to fix B2 than create another one that would be unplayable

vita,3dmhhq,LemonLimeAlltheTime,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:09:18 2015 UTC,it probably will if it is optimized properly
vita,3dmhhq,zetaspawn,4,Fri Jul 17 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"That's an easy statement to say, but practical application is not spoken word.    Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see a fully optimized Borderlands experience on Vita.  However, the amount of money a developer would need to spend to port a game over would be much better spent on new games, in my opinion."
vita,3dmhhq,NoFaQ,0,Fri Jul 17 15:09:05 2015 UTC,Haha ok you act like that is easy or even possible.   There are tons of reasons why another BL game will never ever come to vita.    Vita does t have the specs to run that type of game well as seen in BL2.  Vita market is small and BL2 didn't sell well.  The pre sequel didn't sell well on other platforms anyways.
vita,3dmhhq,Neo_Techni,-4,Sat Jul 18 01:40:06 2015 UTC,Did you play Borderlands 2 on vita? why in the hell would you want MORE of that?   Edit: you guys are all completely insane... or haven't played a well running version like the originals or handsome collection. Not to even mention that the best expansion they've ever made is STILL not included for no good reason.
vita,3dmhhq,Lost_the_weight,3,Fri Jul 17 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"No, it's not the same as the console, because it's not the same console.  Some of us thought it was OK to play."

vita,3dmhhq,Harry050502,2,Fri Jul 17 14:08:37 2015 UTC,yes i did but the problem with that was that it wasn't optimized right by iron galaxy studios. they need to take their time and get all the bugs out before launch

vita,3dks1n,ilove60sstuff,3,Fri Jul 17 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"C/P of my response from the last thread on this:    It is incredibly uncommon for games to be released in Japan in English. It's even more uncommon for those games to not be available in the west in some form. The only exceptions to that would be Moe Chronicle and Chaos Rings Prequel Trilogy*, which have an English release in Hong Kong and other parts of SEA (not Japan) but not North America or Europe. The only slightly common thing is Asian-exclusive physical releases in English. Games like Oreshika, Soul Sacrifice Delta, Sword Art Online: HF and others have English cartridges in South East Asia (note: not the Japanese copies).  *Don't import this unless you're willing to swap accounts. Only Chaos Rings III is on the cart and it doesn't have an English translation on Vita yet. The other three games (which have English scripts) are PSN downloads."

vita,3dia0t,timborobot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's best to find specific people to play against online -- i.e. one of you sets up a game and tells the other to find that game on the server.  Go to internet (bottom middle button on main menu) -> Yes (right button; confirm internet connection)  The top left button is for automatic ranked matches. I've generally found the players I'm pitted up against are much better than I am. T_T So I prefer to set up a game with a friend. This is done with the top middle button (""Club"") -> Select gameplay mode (Vs, Mix, Swap, Party, Big Bang) -> Press triangle to create a room -> Various options (the first tab lets you change things like number of matches to win for a victory, the option to ""hold"" a tetrimino/puyo, etc; the second tab lets you change number of players [2-player, 3-player, or 4-player]; the third tab changes your room icon [just a character art]; the fourth tab changes your room slogan [things like ""Tetris Love,"" i.e. you want everyone to choose Tetris, etc]) -> Anyways once you've messed with all that if you just select the button at the bottom to create your room (with O button, since O is yes and X is cancel in Japanese games)  Your friend meanwhile can press square button to refresh the server to see your room once it's made. Just tell your friend that you're making a Swap game, or a Mix game, or whatever mode it is.  The waiting for opponents screen is all that's left. Select the middle button (that says ""OK"" in it) to say you're ready. Once everyone is ready, the game will start. The room creator can also force the game to start with the third button. This is useful if you accidentally made a four-player game and there's only two of you playing.  I think that's the gist of it! I have no idea what any of the trophies in the game entail though; I never really pay those any attention. I'd be up for some matches however -- my PSN is Reset_Tears."
vita,3dia0t,leysa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks. I had figured out the first half of getting set up but you clarified it for me. I'll friend request you later. I've mainly been working through the story mode, I'm still learning how to better puyo. My only experience with a puyo puzzle game is Dr.Robotniks Mean Bean Machine as a kid. setting up chain combos is pretty inconsistent for me but I'm already seeing some improvement. I think the online trophies are like: 1 ranked win, 10 ranked wins, 1 club win, 10 club wins or something like that."

Japanese Vita games have a few paper inserts which are always in these games and they ship them in special size plastic bags to protect from light scuffs/marks which none have had. If it wasn't for the fact they are telling you it's used you would think it was brand new, I'm always blown away with how Japanese people look after their games."

vita,3didiy,AverageTheJam,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Ive finished 2/3 of the endings for RB3 and this is what Ive noticed.   Stellas Dungeon (Added originally in RB2) has been tweaked and adjusted and now gives you more reason to actually do it. It rewards special plans that you can use in the remake system. They also added companion characters to Stellas Dungeon and they offer additional benefits to make clearing floors easier as well as finding items. SP/EXE gauge have been consolidated into one bar. This allows you to play very differently than you would before and allows you to use many more team compositions than you could before without gimping the team.  Awakened. Basically this is a mode that is similar to HDD for non-CPU characters. The goal in mind with this change was to allow you to use non-CPUs and not feel as gimped as you were previously. So again, more options as far as party compositions. Dungeons. While alot of the dungeons are similar or copies of other dungeons from the Nep series they are notably bigger than previous games. Some have more to run around in while some have added a level of verticality to them.  Item Searching. The game has finally added a feature that has been a real pain for alot of the other Nep games and that is the ability to look up in game where a certain material drops from. For a long time you needed the help of a master list compiled by others but with this addition that is no longer needed.   These are most of the changes I can remember off the top of my head. If you are looking for more answers or possibly more in depth answers you should probably check out the nep reddit. People are always willing to help out those who are interested."
vita,3didiy,Luminous083,2,Thu Jul 16 19:49:46 2015 UTC,Ive finished 2/3 of the endings for RB3 and this is what Ive noticed.   2/9 you mean?   One for each nation Maker ending Normal ending True ending Conquest ending Holy Sword ending   EDIT: I'm an idiot.  Today has been long and I should go to sleep.

vita,3dk7jo,awxvn,3,Thu Jul 16 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"16 GB and 64 GB are the only cards worth getting. 32 GB is too expensive and you might as well just splurge for the 64 GB.  I'll also add that the 64 GB is really just a convenience factor. 16 GB can hold plenty of games, enough for you to play at once, but you just have to spend time transferring content off your PC or redownloading, which is annoying."
vita,3dk7jo,Banana_Kama,2,Fri Jul 17 00:47:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you like to manage your library, 16gb is enough for me - I have quite a range of games on it - but I delete ones I'm done with and replace them with new games. I prefer to manage with a smaller space so I focus on fewer games - I still have a lot though...  Games I have installed - Senran Kagura Bon Appetite 2.5gb, Oreshika Tainted Bloodlines 2.8gb, Final Fantasy Tactics: War of Lions 195mb, Soul Sacrifice Delta 3.1gb, Final Fantasy VI 133mb, Tearaway 1.4gb, Frozen Synapse Prime 282mb, Minecraft 400mb - also about 1gb+ of game updates.  Then: Rogue Legacy, Dokuro, Don't Starve, Luftrausers, Race The Sun, Futuridium EP Delux, FEZ, Spelunky, Table Top Racing, - and 5 minis/PSM games.  I'm currently playing Freedom Wars via the cartridge. I bought MGS collection on card for £12 as its over 3gb. There aren't many games over 3gb to be honest, but even so, you can have plenty of games with a 16gb card."
vita,3dk7jo,Saibanchou,2,Thu Jul 16 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly my approach as well. If you keep your Vita clean by deleting games you're done with, 16 GB is more than enough and offers great value for its price."

vita,3df7ed,gamerman9800,4,Wed Jul 15 23:16:02 2015 UTC,RB2 adds alot more than Nep1 did so if you enjoyed that you will get more of the same and then some.  RB1 had 3 endings while RB2 has 9.  RB2 also added Stellas Dungeon which is a mini game that you can micro manage while you play.  RB2 also added 4 man parties rather than 3 man.   Plenty of good changes for those who enjoyed the first game. Re;Birth 3 adds even more quality of life changes if you ever get there as well!
vita,3df7ed,Luminous083,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:00 2015 UTC,Have you played RB2 on Vita? I own both on Steam and RB1 on Vita. Does the framerate improve in RB1 (after the first area) and in RB 2 on Vita? I would get annoyed whenever there were dips since they were really noticeable.
vita,3df7ed,whypickaname1,2,Thu Jul 16 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"RB1 - RB3 do have dips in framerate on the Vita. For example, in RB3 with MAGES. when you attack quite a few mobs (4+ with an AoE spell the game actually almost semi freezes for about half a second). In reference to RB2 its basically the same issues. When you load into a dungeon you will get a spike of lag while the map loads but thats about it. You will also get some decent lag when attacking multiple mobs or using certain specials.   In every case I personally would not consider the situations serious enough to warrant not buying the game, but, if framerate is something that really bothers you I would be lying if I told you that any of the RB games dont have framerate drops under specific conditions."
vita,3df7ed,Luminous083,2,Thu Jul 16 03:09:34 2015 UTC,I will most likely get there. I couldn't put down my vita for a second when I got Re;Birth 1. It would most likely be the same for Re;Birth 2.

vita,3df7ed,Qlooki,6,Wed Jul 15 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"They both play pretty much the exact same way. The only real difference is that parties consist of three characters in RB1 and four in RB2. Outside of that there were no major changes to how combat works.   I would suggest playing one before two because it explains who characters are and how all the systems work. Two will explain some of the basics but it assumes you know how most of it works from RB1. That being said they ARE in different dimensions so you could technically play two without ever plaything the first one, but I wouldnt advise it."

Luckily, if you are interested in buying it you can 100% get the game without having played any of the other NepNep games. The normal Nep games are RPG's while Noire is an SRPG. Im not sure how well the game acclimates you to the cast but thats probably the only issue you would have getting it before playing the others.  Outside of that alot of the people who love Nep have gave the game a pretty solid review. The only issue alot of people had with it is alot of the trophies are apparently pretty grindy. So if you are a trophy hunter that might be a downside but outside of that most people talk favorably of it."

My parents asked me that year what I wanted for christmas, the DS or a GBA SP since I only had the regular GBA, and my thinking was ""Oh, well the DS is just a portable gamecube, and I already have a gamecube, why would I need that?"" so I chose an SP over a DS and felt dumb."

vita,3delvs,burritosandblunts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:38:10 2015 UTC,You'd be absolutely blown away at what people sell their stuff for. I routinely grab psp for $5 at garage sales. I have friends who've found ps3s already for $40 with a stack of games. I bought a n64 collection worth well over $400 for $15 in may. It takes a lot of patience and a little skill with a pinch of luck. Legit deals are out there.
vita,3delvs,Granpire,7,Wed Jul 15 23:29:48 2015 UTC,My father used to be one of those people. He'd buy something and a month or two later he'd sell it for half of what it's worth.    We didn't trust him with money.
vita,3delvs,burritosandblunts,3,Wed Jul 15 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"That may be true with garage sales, but there's no way of knowing whether you purchased from a thief on classified ads.  The red flag for me is the person not knowing what it is they're selling, or the true value of it. That reeks of theft, in my opinion.   No way of knowing, I guess, and it's maybe not the buyer's problem one way or the other."

You can take it back if you want, but you'll see no difference between a new copy in shrinkwrap and a new display copy at GS. Not for P4G, anyway; if you bought a brand new, just-released title they have been known to throw extras out so you'll end up missing launch day DLC codes and the like, but that's not going to be the case here."

vita,3dkm8d,Fatzmanz,3,Fri Jul 17 01:31:57 2015 UTC,Considering that its not a disc based game there is LITTERALLY 0 difference between a new and used copy outside of the saves which if thats that big of a deal (and if there are any which I doubt) you can just delete them and BAM new game.

vita,3dkm8d,anaharae,-7,Fri Jul 17 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"Xephon, get off his back. New to him (and lots of others) means sealed. It doesn't mean unused. It means untouched, undisturbed, and factory sealed.  If you don't appreciate this distinction, cool, no harm no foul. But there's a reason why literally every consumer product loses value when it is opened.

SO LISTEN UP BUDDY:    For starters this isn't a JRPG, so that's one thing.  Second of all, Danganronpa hews closer to LucasArts adventures more than any visual novel as the ""useless point-and-click on the environment"" is kind of the bread and butter of the genre.  Third, you haven't even gotten to the first class trial and while there's something to be said about immediate impressions, you've merely touched the very surface of the game. Last of all, I don't know which Persona games you played, but those had lengthy introductory sequences where you'd be shepherded through tutorials without much direct input. DR by comparison is actually pretty brisk and to the point.   Your complaint about the control scheme being awkward is valid though; I'm not a fan of using the analog stick to move around but everything else is okay."
vita,3dilsh,easterreddit,4,Thu Jul 16 17:18:24 2015 UTC,"The game spends about an hour or two setting up each and every character so it's less predictable, then it really kicks into gear. Give it until the end of the first case at least, which takes about 4 hours.  I personally think the crime sections of the game are fantastically paced whilst also being quite lengthy, the class trials in particular. Be sure to give them a shot."
vita,3dilsh,MalusandValus,4,Thu Jul 16 16:19:29 2015 UTC,"Don't approach it like a game, because it isn't one. It's a visual novel, so approach it like a book. Ask yourself, ""Do I feel like reading a book right now?"" If the answer is no, play something else."
vita,3dilsh,LastTrophy,3,Fri Jul 17 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"I actually started this game a week ago and finished in 3 days. Knew absolutely nothing about it since I wanted to avoid spoilers.   To answer your question, I felt the game picked up in pace after the first case. Now every other case after may be longer, but it didn't bother me because of how hooked I got into the story. Yes there's a lot of pointless things to look at but once you learn what things you don't need to look at then less time is wasted. I honestly think this wasn't as slow paced as P4G's beginning."
vita,3dilsh,TheLJWay,3,Thu Jul 16 16:12:39 2015 UTC,It speeds up as more people die lol there's sorta character bloat at the beginning to facilitate being able to kill a ton of them. It does indeed pick up.

My guess is all vitas work the same with it but I put it out there just in case it is relevant.   Yes, both should work the same. However, there is an accessory which is exclusive to the Slim Vita that makes remote play a lot better.  This accessory, which is currently only available for the Slim model allows you to have actual L2/R2 buttons. This helps a lot for remote play, as one of the biggest annoyances for me is not having L2/R2 buttons when playing PS4 games."

The accessory I linked to gives you L2/R2 buttons(it presses on the back touchpad) so when you're using remote play on PS4 you will have L1/R1 and L2/R2 buttons instead of having to press on the back touchpad to use L2/R2.  I don't believe there's an accessory yet for the 1000 that does this."

The original, or 1000, or OLED version (it's referred to as all of those) of the Vita has a arguably better screen.  It's a bit bulkier and more durable also.  It's no longer manufactured so you will be hard pressed to find a new one.  The slim, or 2000 version is slightly lighter, thinner, and has a longer battery life.  It's the current version and what you'll see on the shelves in stores.    In all honesty, it doesn't much matter.  I have a slight preference toward the 1000 because I like the screen a bit better, but by no means would I be unhappy with owning a 2000 if I had one."

And two, the focus of game design shouldn't be on its graphics and its ability to replicate another console's capabilities. You'll also have people who just port games for money without any kind of passion for the game itself and you get half-hearted lazy unenjoyable ports.   With that, what you get is a ""console game"" stripped of its smooth frame rate, graphics, and basically overall enjoyment. Because they don't care about how good it is as a game itself but rather on how close is it to its original.  If I wanted to play a ""console game"", I'll play it on the console. I don't expect it to have the same experience on a handheld (yet). But I can have as much if not more fun with exclusives that can only be played on a handheld. Think pokemon, 3ds only zelda games, gravity rush, monster hunter and so on."

I'm a fan of RPGs and some indies, so the Vita has really found its way into my heart.    Having said that, I do agree with you.  It's not the ""console-on-the-go"" that they were hoping for.  Lack of AAA games and dev support have left the Vita to serve a niche area in consoles.  For what it does, it's untouchable and nothing can compete.

I knew what I was getting myself into when I bought the vita, Japanese games. And I'm quite pleased to say I'm satisfied with my purchase. I know that people who bought it for console on the go experience are disappointed, but honestly, it's been years already. Complaining is useless now. Might I suggest that you try out PS Plus if you have nothing else to buy?"
vita,3deo6x,Martin15Sleith,2,Wed Jul 15 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"I bought it just for the japanese games too. I tried to play some console-like games like Uncharted and Soul Sacrifice and didn't like it because I feel the screen is too small for these kind of games, but it's amazing for visual novels and JRPGs, especially the ones that require a lot of reading"
vita,3deo6x,newdoctah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:31 2015 UTC,I remember that Metal Gear Solid 4 Demo that was running on Vita.   All I wanted is an all new portable MGS Portable Ops or Peace Walker style...
vita,3deo6x,SolidGamerSnake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:31:33 2015 UTC,"Valve announced Portable Steam Machines?   Well I don't feel like it. I bought my Vita for Digimon, being a huge Digimon fan, and so far the future for the Vita looks bright for me personally. I also like how many Indie titles get ported to Vita as I feel that these titles work better on a a smaller, more portable console. I also like a few of the Japanese games and big publishers like Square Enix finally show some interest in publishing games on the Vita, even if they are multi platform.  I think the big day and age of Vita exclusives has ended and those who buy a vita do so because it's cheap nowadays and/or simply want those multi platform games on the go.  It's not the greatest future for vita but it's good enough for me. Although I completely understand how you feel and why you do so."
vita,3deo6x,TheGamer821,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every game on the Vita blows its competition out of the water graphics wise. There are maybe a small handful of 3DS games that look anywhere near as good as a Vita game. As far as I'm concerned I'm getting my console on the go experience.   I couldn't care less about big budgeted ""AAA"" games, just give me fun to play and entertaining games and I'm set."
vita,3deo6x,razisgosu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly the same. And eventually now I dislike anime and jrpgs a whole lot more than my 'who cares' stand before I bought Vita in 2012. BL2 is one of my favorite games, but I decided to ignore Vita underdeveloped port existence. I've put ton of time into KZ and NFS. And indies kinda grew up on me - Rogue Legacy, Binding of Isaac and Spelunky are amazing games and awesome on the go. Looking forward to RE Rev2 as it's great game with great Raid mode (I own it on PC, played a lot in split screen). Still, why do Sony created handheld platform that has dual analogs but there isn't many fps/tps shooters? They definitely designed device for western audience. And they promised exactly that. FPS market is huge - Vita could destroy mobile FPS market as ultimate FPS device with it's big screen and physical controls. Yet most of Vita's games are games that could be easily imagined playable on psp. What's that second stick for? And then Sony blamed everyone for failure. Nvidia Shield is a lot better device after all, GTA:SA and HL2 and Portal and all those Android FPS/TPS/Racing games. Vita was first, better designed, better looking, and yet Sony failed miserably when all roads were free - they hadn't found where to drive it. Now there is no redemption for Vita now, japanese companies just exploiting people who bought Vita as companion for PS4 (where not much new games yet too). And Nvidia actually support it's device and port and tune those games by themselves. Or maybe they are western company that knows what western market wants. .. Who knows. What I know - I feel betrayed, being forced to play awful CoD and Resistance (both are insults to their series) on Vita because there isn't much else to play..."
vita,3deo6x,friendlyoffensive,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"I wish we could get more console like titles on the go, but I've been having a blast with Vita either way. Out of Japan we get some excellent visual novels and jrpgs. Hell some of those jrpgs feel like console titles. We even have Digimon coming!   Then there are all the excellent indies that get ported which I feel better suit a handheld. I prefer to play all of these in vita instead of Ps4 or PC. There is a plethora of them coming too.   Then there are the adventure games (Fandango and Day of The Tentacle). As well as the games that Sony funds like Heldivers and the like.   In addition to the PsP and PS1 classics and native retail vita games I would say the library is excellent.   Side Note; while I do think the console size games are cool on vita I find them more difficult to play while on the go. Most of them aren't something I would pick up and play while between classes or waiting for the train. Instead I find them good for playing at home."

Turns out I was more just interested to see console games running on mobile for the novelty factor. Once I saw it, it sort of stopped being important to me. I own my Vita as a Japanese gaming machine now. I do expect big things of it, though--Sony's treatment of the Vita as an indie machine in the west is almost insulting, and I have nothing against indie games."

My grad program gave me an ipad and I've honestly just transitioned largely to gaming on it when I'm on the go since it unfortunately has a larger selection of games, including some killers like FTL and Xcom."

The vita is not dead otherwise there would be absolutely no games coming out in 2015 Vita memory cards are what I believe solely ruined the Vitas reputation, $120 for a 32 GB memory card? You can go fuck yourself Sony. Vita owners have constantly praised the 3DS because it is a great system. Most 3DS owners scoff/dismiss the Vita simply because they don't sell as well and that means there are no good games. Same goes for the Dreamcast right? It didn't sell well so that must mean it had no games and the ones it did have are shit. Right?"

vita,3dhtz2,Martin15Sleith,2,Thu Jul 16 13:11:57 2015 UTC,"I got it for free. And it's best for beginners to the shooter genre, according to me. If you're expecting something of the console COD quality, forget it. Killzone's your best bet for that."
vita,3dhtz2,Zeldoon,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:46 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that it's best for beginners to the shooter genre, at least when it comes to single player.  Declassified is considered to have one of the hardest single player campaign in the Call of Duty franchise.  Can't speak much for the multiplayer as I did not enjoy it, so didn't play more than 20 minutes of it."
vita,3dhtz2,Martin15Sleith,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"Hardest? I'm a complete noob when it comes to shooters, and I managed to platinum the game. While I haven't played many shooters, Declassified, in my opinion wasn't really that hard. It's only challenging at the hardest difficulty, and it's got some annoying trophies, but that's all there's to it."
vita,3dhtz2,Zeldoon,3,Thu Jul 16 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"Well as far as the Call of Duty franchise is concern, Declassified is typically considered the 2nd hardest, the first being World at War.  Trophy difficult rating for Declassified is 8/10, so it's pretty difficult.  You might just be really good at first person shooters :P."
vita,3dhtz2,Martin15Sleith,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:59 2015 UTC,".......That's the best compliment I've ever gotten online.  That aside, I say I'm a noob because I suck at multiplayer. Compared to the monstrous hardcore COD players out there, my skills aren't really anything special. And I platinummed declassified, only because I was persistent. I even retried some levels around a few hundred times in Declassified for the sake of getting the platinum. So yeah, it's mainly because I was stubborn. I got the platinum through hard work, not skills."

Ten By Eight is a thoroughly legit puzzle game from Action Button, who you might know from Ziggurat or Videoball.

Add to that you account can be hacked/stolen or Sony could just ban you from using it for any reason they want as it's written just like that in the PSN ToS."

It feels like a step back as there is no incentive to level multiple classes per character as there is no carryover, multiple classes are pretty much mandatory for exploring and parts of the story the game would be better off without. The exploring is fine and it's not too grindy given there are level caps for the first two chapters of the game but after a certain point you'll just be mashing x through a majority of battles till more difficult fights.

vita,3dctce,PlasticRhombus,10,Thu Jul 16 14:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Criminal Girls isn't hentai, dude. If you're gonna hate on most of the following of a console that you own, you should probably actually know what you're talking about. Those games are 'ecchi', not hentai. Hentai is explicitly sexual. 'Ecchi' means pervy, and honestly the games are pretty underwhelming in that category if you actually played them. They're not that bad."
vita,3dctce,StilRH,4,Thu Jul 16 14:36:45 2015 UTC,"jesus christ dude you don't know anything about this game. the western release literally has no voiceover in those scenes.  the argument is the animated characters vs. real people one which is worth discussing, but you're just throwing flat insults and incendiary buzzwords around so no reason to even patronize you ₍₍⁽⁽(ી(@‿ゝ@)ʃ)₎₎⁾⁾"

vita,3dgcso,ItalianoMobzter7,3,Thu Jul 16 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. I enjoy it more on my Vita than my PS3 due to the D-Pad on the Vita being much better. It's so much easier to roll from 41236 (left, down, right; look at number pad :)) on the Vita than the DS3 or even DS4 from my small experience.   The only thing that would be difficult is if you are strictly a fight stick guy. Otherwise, the Vita is a great home for the BlazBlue series."
vita,3dgcso,GeneralChaz9,2,Thu Jul 16 04:20:27 2015 UTC,"Good point, I exclusively use the D-Pad for this series but I only have a PS3 game. You made a strong case for the vita."
vita,3dgcso,foboat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:43 2015 UTC,D-pads are perfectly fine for fighting games. It's 99% personal preference when it comes to the Stick vs Pad debate. The vita also happens to have one of the better pads compared to other consoles.
vita,3dgcso,SerbianShitStain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"All a matter of personal preference,  I love my vita but when playing fighting games particularly, i prefer using a dualshock controller in my hands when playing competitive.

vita,3dfjtt,buddhijay88,2,Thu Jul 16 11:39:01 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of some of the most recommended games, and here is a list of over 350 upcoming games for the system.   Hopefully this helps.   Also, I'm a little bit worried about the durability of the vita, it seems a lot more breakable than a 3DS, so does anyone have suggestions for a case?   I'm not sure about the Vita 2000/Slim, but my Vita 1000/OLED has been dropped many times, and it still works fine. I'd recommend a good screen protector at least though. Sadly, the case I own for my Vita(I barely use it though) apparently isn't being made anymore. Hopefully someone else can recommend another one.  EDIT: Saw your edit, so figured I would answer that too.   Edit: I forgot to add that I bought the Borderlands 2 bundle so it comes with an 8gb memory card. Will that be enough?   If you're planning to go fully digital, or buy a lot of games then no, that won't be enough. I think Borderlands 2 alone, once fully installed/updated takes 5-6GB, though it is one of the rare games that is that big(most are under 3GB in my experience). I'd recommend a 16GB card at least, but the 8GB will work if you purchase mostly physical games or are fine with deleting games constantly. Sadly, deleting PS Vita games also deletes the save file. So be sure to either upload the save to the cloud before deletion(requires PS+ subscription), or use the PS Vita CMA(Content Manager Assistant) to upload the game/save file to your PC."
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Wed Jul 15 21:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see that both Disgaea and Katamari are on the list :)  About the case, I was really more concerned about scratches on the screen than it dropping. My 3ds has gotten really beat up on the outside just from my keys and whatever else swims around my purse when I toss it in there. Do you think the screen protector would be enough to protect from those scratches? I don't care as much about superficial scratches, I just don't want it to effect gameplay."
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Wed Jul 15 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see that both Disgaea and Katamari are on the list :)   Yeah, you can also download the PSP games for those series, but obviously that will take up space on your card(Sadly, a lot of the Vitas best games are download only). I think Disgaea 1/2 are on PSP, and 3/4 are natively on the Vita.  Well, I'm a guy so I don't carry a purse(though they do seem useful!) so I can't comment on that. The keys might be an issue, so a cheap case to just prevent physical contact with the screen might be worth investing in.  If you have any questions in the future(once you get your Vita) feel free to message me on Reddit(or you can add me on PSN once you create one, more Vita friends are always welcome!). I've had my Vita since 2012 and it's easily my most used system currently."

vita,3dfjtt,IAmZingy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"The FF Tactics is the updated version of the PS1 game.  So it's not the same as the one on GBA (I love that one). However, that's not to say FFT WotL is bad."
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Fri Jul 17 21:31:31 2015 UTC,"I have the Borderlands bundle as well but I get physical copies of games so the memory card has been fine so far. That being said, the B2 download and all the DLC it comes with does take up a good portion of the memory. You'd probably only be able to fit another 3 GB game on it until it was full. If you go physical it shouldn't be a problem, at least not for a good while.   EDIT: Also, the games I've played most since getting it a week ago have been Project Diva F 2nd and Senran Kagura. They are both addictive and fun!"
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"I am new to the Vita myself (Kind-of), I've had mine for about a year in total, but only really started playing it a few weeks ago. I'm selling my black one as I bought a Lime Green/White one.  Anyway enough rambling. Welcome! I'd seriously recommend Persona 4 Golden; I've not been able to put it down, I've fallen in love with the Vita and the game so much. I found there is an Anime of the game and I was so so happy. It's a really good game, one of the best games I have ever played. Entwined is also very good, as well as, Geometry Wars (Both are FREE on PS Plus as of right now). The Vita has A LOT of RPG's of all varieties, as well as indie games so if that's up your alley then you've got a lot of choice. Furthermore the Vita has games in different genres too. Like NFS Most Wanted and Terraway which are so both reay good games.   Regarding storage, it all depends, if you plan on buying physical games then it COULD be enough. But if you're planning on digital too, I would invest in a 16GB - 32GB minimum. I've just ordered a 64GB; they're expensive I know but a worthwhile investment in the long run.   Cases it depends, in the UK I can't find the ""vault case"" that other people can find, which I've heard really good things about. Additionally, sites like playasia.com stock L2 and R2 button grips if Remote Play is your thing too. You can also get ""grips"" which make the Vita more comfortable to hold for long sessions. I'm going to order the Nyko one for mine. Not only does it help with grip, it comes with a battery pack too! Claims upto 2x additional power!   I'm rambling here, but this is my 2 cents. Hope you find it useful!"
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:47 2015 UTC,"Uggh, I didn't even realize that the vita came in colors. I just looked it up and I'm already jealous. The lime green and the light blue look so nice with the white front.   I've played Persona Q and I really liked the characters and the style of it, but found the dungeons a little boring after a while. I'll definitely take a look at Persona 4 and all those free games :)  After looking around on Amazon, I'll definitely get the 64GB. I can't believe the prices though... its a little crazy for sd cards, but i'd rather just buy the 64GB now for $20 more instead of having to upgrade from a 32Gb in a few months.   The vault case looks a little on the bulky side for me and I'd prefer a case that I didnt have to take the vita out of the play, but I'll keep looking around. (No PS4, so remote pay is, unfortunately, not an option) I definitely considered buying a grip for my 3DS, but I've heard that the Vita is like better designed and cramps your hands less? Do you know anything about this? haha  This is so much useful information... thank you so so much!"
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"I've played Persona Q and I really liked the characters and the style of it, but found the dungeons a little boring after a while. I'll definitely take a look at Persona 4   Persona Q has characters from Persona 3/4, so you'll be familiar with some of the characters at least. I haven't played Persona Q, but I believe it's gameplay is supposed to be like Etrian Odyssey, whereas Persona 4 is more of a turn-based RPG(though a fast-paced one). It's one of my favorite JRPG's of all time, so if you're a fan of that genre you will almost definitely love Persona 4 Golden.  I don't own one yet, but this grip supposedly doubles the Vita battery life."
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,2,Wed Jul 15 23:27:21 2015 UTC,I just ordered the grip and Persona 4 :)
vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,2,Fri Jul 17 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"Persona 4 Golden is amazing JRPG, I'm sure you'll love it! :)"
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"Don't feel too bad. Those color vita are import only.  Personally, the 3DS made my hand cramp. The Vita fits comfortably in my hand. The most I've played on that thing non-stop is about 10 hours. (I had to leave it plugged in). My hand felt fine after that marathon.  I love Persona 4 Golden, but really didn't like Persona Q (PQ gameplay is very similar to Etrian Odyssey). So don't use Persona Q as a reference to whether you will like P4G or not.  I want to recommend Gravity Rush, but this game is a hit or miss with most people. You're either going to really love it or it simply won't click with you at all.  Soul Sacrifice Delta, a dark and grim story but very fun. It's a hunter style game.  Steins; Gate, it's a pure visual novel but the story is fantastic.   Dangan Ronpa 1+2, it's an adventure visual novel. So there are some exploration and interactive gameplay but the meat of the game lies in the text.  Virtue's Last Reward - You may have already play this on the 3DS. If not, I recommend the PSVita version over the 3DS. The graphic is far more crisp, and the sound is way better (3DS version is highly compressed). Also, you don't have to worry about the save deleting bug.  If you want to kick back, Lumines or Hot Shot Golf.  If you don't mind some of the fan service, Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a pretty decent game.  Akiba's Trip is also quite fun. The premise sounds weird but the game has a lot of charm."
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"Steins; Gate, it's a pure visual novel but the story is fantastic.   Would you still recommend Steins;Gate if I've already seen the anime? I'm not sure how different the game is."
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,2,Thu Jul 16 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"I would. But if you've seen the anime just recently, then give it a little longer.  I seen the anime first, and then played the game about 10 months later. Still loved it.  The VN is told through Okabe's point of view. It's rather amusing to see how a shift in perspective can really change how you view the story. Also, there are multiple endings, so it's enjoyable to see those."
vita,3dfjtt,MasterInterface,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"I want to say it was around two years ago I saw the anime(I didn't even know it was based on a VN at the time), so it's been awhile. I still remember some of the larger plot points, but a lot of it I don't remember.  I think I'll preorder it. I've read a few reviews of the EU version, so it seems like it's a good port. Do you know if the Vita version has English voice actors? I watched the anime in Japanese, so seeing the story in English might make it feel more different to me."

vita,3dfjtt,ZebraMuffin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"P4G is generally around $20. Maybe once in a while, it will be $15. But it's not going to vary much in price.  Gravity Rush, I suggest finding a physical copy, it's usually cheap. And if your local Target has a few PSVita games, there is a chance you'll find this title for $5-$7 in the clearance section.  Soul Sacrifice Delta is digital only. It's normally around $18. I've only seen it on sale once for ~$7.  Steins;Gate for PSVita is not out yet in NA. It's $40, and exclusive to Amazon (retail copy). Alternatively, you can import the EU version. There will not be any DLC to worry about.  Dangan Ronpa 1+2 is on sale on Amazon for $30 each. That's around the best deal you can get.   Virtue's Last Reward generally floats around $20 (retail). I think it was on sale on PSN a few times.  Lumines is currently on sale for $8 on PSN. Hot Shot Golf is usually around $20. Again, check your local target, a few of mine has it in the clearance section all the time for around $7.  Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus retail only comes in the LE. But it has fallen to $40 quite a few times.  Akiba's Trip is a bit stubborn. Lowest I think is $30."

It offers the best Nep experience yet and the story is decently long. They also offer the previously paid DLC for free with the game as well (The level increasing DLC) So now you can go all the way up to 999 without even paying for that extra content.

There is an option in the game called elective mode that allows you to map abilities to whichever button you want.

vita,3d9p27,jashsu,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:05 2015 UTC,"I like to point to 2013 as possibly his worst year. PS4 launched then, Vita was reeling after a poor 2012. So which platform gets the best lineup from Sony? The aging PS3. God of War: Ascension, The Last of Us, Beyond, Puppeteer, Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus and Gran Turismo 6. Meanwhile, Vita got Soul Sacrifice, Killzone Mercenary and Tearaway. PS4 got the trash known as Knack and a mediocre Killzone Shadowfall (that only served to pull attention away from one of SCE's few Vita releases). That shows incredibly poor planning on his part. Did PS3 really need such a strong software library that late into its life? Wouldn't Vita and PS4 benefited more from those games? To top it off, all of those PS3 games bar TLoU underperformed.    Beyond that, he seems to have really poor judgment and quality control. SCE games are probably the least consistent of the three hardware manufacturers. He okays plenty of games for release when they're in no state for that and greenlights projects that stand no chance at commercial success or growing a userbase. In addition to that, his SCE really sucks at building franchises. The Last of Us is really the only new big IP Sony has made since he's taken charge. Under his guidance, Sony has however lost a significant amount of its IPs. LBP is now on its deathbed thanks to really poor product planning (no, iterating on the same concept 5 times is not a good idea). Jak, Sly, Wild Arms, LocoRoco, Patapon, WipEout, The Getaway, etc. are dead. Infamous and Killzone are no bigger than they were before him. Gran Turismo and God of War have seen huge contractions under his watch and as far as Japan is concerned, SCE is basically irrelevant.    Oh, and his branch of Sony has abandoned one of its platforms three years into its life. He's routinely said things that can be summed up as ""Fuck off, Vita owners. Buy a PS4."" That's a big part of why their games are irrelevant in Japan."
vita,3d9p27,InYourHands,2,Wed Jul 15 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not outright defending Yoshida, I think he's just alright, but here's a couple things I disagree with or that I think are unfair:   Did PS3 really need such a strong software library that late into its life?    What do you expect them to do? Cancel the games that have been in development on PS3 for years? Not every game can ""Last Guardian"" in to the next generation. Very few of those games would have been profitable in that case.   Wouldn't Vita and PS4 benefited more from those games?   Vita? Absolutely. But, like I said, the games were already in development, changing to a portable platform is easier said than done. PS4? Every console generation starts like that. The PS3 launched with Resistance, Genji, and Ridge Racer 7, while the PS2 was getting God of War 2, Final Fantasy 12, and Persona 4. That's just the nature of console cycles.     Infamous and Killzone are no bigger than they were before him   Disagree completely on InFamous, the franchise is bigger than ever after Second Son. Killzone is debatable, not quite as epic as 2 or 3, but it's on a much more hyped platform.    greenlights projects that stand no chance at commercial success   You complain about this, but then you think they should make another Wild Arms game, are you freaking kidding me? Those are just two completely opposite views. The reason so many IPs are dead, is because they don't think there's much chance of profitability.    ""Fuck off, Vita owners. Buy a PS4.""   No argument there. I'm extremely disappointed they took this viewpoint.   2013 seems like such a poor year because it was a launch year. Give it another year, when Horizon, Dreams, and other new IPs are out and most of your complaints (Edit: PS4 complaints anyway) will have disappeared."
vita,3d9p27,Qwarkster,-1,Wed Jul 15 05:03:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what I'm complaining about. I'm not saying he should have cancelled those PS3 games. I'm saying the majority should have never been PS3 games in the first place. The decision to greenlight games is made years before they're released, so Yoshida must have believed that Vita lineup was okay in face of what PS3 was getting. Even if Vita didn't sell like garbage and had notable western third party support, that would've been a poor lineup (it's an even worse lineup given how poor Vita sold). That shows tremendously bad judgment on his part. PS3 shouldn't have been taking the spotlight away from the brand new and struggling handheld and the upcoming home console, but that's exactly what Yoshida's 2013 lineup did.    Games like Gran Turismo 6 and God of War: Ascension probably would have sold worse on Vita than they did on PS3 (though, probably not by a tonne given how significantly both underperformed), but they would've contributed a tonne more to Vita's health than they did to PS3's. As a platform holder, those are decisions Sony should have been making. Instead, Yoshida decided PS3 was the best bet and got burned on 95% of those projects anyway.    The PS2 example you gave isn't the same. For starters, two of them are third party games. Third parties only have to look after their project profitability and 120+ million PS2s is a much better investment than <10 million PS3s. I've already said that first parties have more to look after than just individual project profitability. Launch era PS3s could play all of those PS2 games anyway. But more important than all of that, PS3 was already in decline when those games came out. Pretty much no franchise was setting records in 2013. People were already tired of that gen's hardware and audiences weren't responding to yet another sequel on those machines (which is why TLoU succeeded where everything else flopped). Again, that's something Yoshida should have anticipated, but he didn't.    I just want to point out how poorly Killzone was handled in 2013 as well. It's never been as big as Sony has wanted it, and that's okay. But knowing it's not a gigantic franchise, what does Sony do? Launch a significantly less marketed spinoff as a Vita marquee title weeks before they launch a significantly more expensive, more advertised PS4 sequel. Genius work, Yoshida. Shadowfall totally wasn't going to overshadow Mercenary at all ...    Oh, and Wild Arms could totally be a successful series for Sony. On Vita. Especially since both potential devs have Vita experience on projects that can be profitable with <200k sales. A $40 million PS4 game makes no sense, so I fully expect Yoshida greenlight one."
vita,3d9p27,InYourHands,2,Wed Jul 15 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what I'm complaining about.   I do, but to be fair, you're complaining about a lot of stuff, a lot of points to cover. You say that they should've not been PS3 games at all, but they would've been several years in development before the PS4 was even available to developers. I agree they fumbled horribly with the Vita, I'm not arguing that at all. I'm disagreeing that Yoshida is bad at his job.    so Yoshida must have believed that Vita lineup was okay   To be fair, the launch lineup was okay, it was the support after that they failed on. I would've loved if all of those games were on Vita instead, but they evidently had little faith in the platform. As you said, most of them performed fairly on PS3, they would've cost more to develop and would've underperformed more on Vita. It's not a bad idea to keep that risk on PS3 with 80 million users.    I've already said that first parties have more to look after than just individual project profitability.   And they did, it's just most of them were either not that great, Knack, or suffered heavy delays, Driveclub, The Order. And the Vita had a large number of first party launch titles. Again, it makes no sense to move already started projects to new consoles with little hope of making any of that back.    Oh, and Wild Arms could totally be a successful series for Sony.   Ehhhh, that's a bit of a stretch. Wild Arms XF definitely did not set the PSP on fire and sales have consistently declined throughout the series. There's a lot of lesser known Sony series that I want revived. Legaia, Tomba, Medievil, Ape Escape, but I'm not going to hold my breath because there just isn't much interest in those series."
vita,3d9p27,Qwarkster,0,Wed Jul 15 15:02:19 2015 UTC,"As you said, most of them performed fairly on PS3, they would've cost more to develop and would've underperformed more on Vita.     What. I said most of them flopped on PS3 and that's the truth. I doubt any Vita game, even Killzone, cost as much as something like GoW: A did. It's weaker hardware, and most of Sony's franchise Vita games are built out of using assets from the PS3 games. Killzone Mercenary runs on the Killzone 3 engine. LBP Vita takes a tonne of its assets from LBP2. Same with Uncharted: Golden Abyss. Modnation Racers: Road Trip might as well be a hack of the PS3 game. It wouldn't have cost a tonne to make a Gran Turismo game on Vita primarily using assets from GT5. The difference between things like GoW:A and GT flopping on Vita and flopping on PS3 would be that those games would've at least pushed Vita hardware sales and created a healthier ecosystem. On PS3, they did nothing because it was already past its prime. As a first party, Sony's #1 concern is ensuring their platforms are healthy places to make games on. It's not to act like a third party and only release games on the highest userbase. And again, even there Yoshida failed because almost all of those games were commercial failures on PS3.      SCE was there at Vita's launch, sure. But I've never argued that they weren't. I specifically called out 2013 as a banner example of why Yoshida is bad at his job. He's said that they plan their first party release lineup 2 years in advance. That means he felt that Soul Sacrifice, Killzone and Tearaway were all Vita deserved in 2013 before it even went on sale. I don't see how anyone would think that's a good lineup, especially in comparison to what PS3 was getting from SCE. It's even worse when you consider the dearth of releases from third parties and that Vita really needed the support.    Ignore PS4. Given SCE only supports one platform, it'll get its first party support eventually. I only mentioned it because in hindsight it makes his decision for 2013 to be PS3 heavy even more foolish than it was during then.    At this point I feel like I'm talking in circles. You agree that he's done a horrible job with Vita post-launch (outside of Vita, there are also a tonne of poorly supported abandoned initiatives like PS Eye, Move, 3D, Wonderbook, PSMobile - and should it not sell 20 million units on day-1, most likely Morpheus too). You agree that under his watch SCE has killed a variety of its franchises and has struggled to replace them. You agree that SCE has quality control issues (""Let's spend 10s of millions The Order!""). After all of that, how is he not bad at his job?     Ehhhh, that's a bit of a stretch. Wild Arms XF definitely did not set the PSP on fire and sales have consistently declined throughout the series. There's a lot of lesser known Sony series that I want revived. Legaia, Tomba, Medievil, Ape Escape, but I'm not going to hold my breath because there just isn't much interest in those series.      XF was a spinoff and was at a time where the IP was probably too active for its own good (it was pretty much an annual series at that point). If they were to develop a Wild Arms 6 for Vita, I do believe it would do at least 150k in Japan. Which if budgeted right, should be good profit for Sony. I mean, they've successfully revived Oreshika (though, I wouldn't expect a third game due to Yoshida's QC pretty much destroying its rep in Japan) and that's far more obscure. Wild Arms is also really unique in its genre due to its setting.    Ape Escape is something I actually believe should be revived. Right now Vita is seemingly making headway with Japanese kids, so an engaging eastern mascot platformer with capture mechanics designed around Vita's many inputs could be a really cool game. As for the rest of your wishlist, Legaia is far more obscure than Wild Arms, Sony never owned Tomba (Gungho currently does) and they've tried relaunching Medievil multiple times (Cambridge were working on new PSP and PS3 games that got cancelled)."

If you wanna watch anime you can use animehaven its really high quality and really well updated and ofc works with the vita you just gotta watch the mirror links

vita,3dcwui,The_True_Black_Jesus,3,Wed Jul 15 07:50:37 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd recommend:   Persona 4 Golden Tales of Hearts R(Japanese only voices, if that's an issue) Don't Starve(I've put over a hundred hours into this game across PS4/Vita, and the Vita version is a very good port)   The other games I either haven't played due to lack of interest or them not having released yet(Steins;Gate isn't out yet in NA).  I've heard Helldivers is a lot of fun and while I have played Velocity 2X and Dead Nation, neither really caught my attention(not a huge fan of their genres).  Sword Art Online isn't bad(though it is VERY grind-heavy from my experience) and if you decide to pick up Soul Sacrifice get the upgraded version Soul Sacrifice Delta(digital only game on PSN).  Honestly, if you love RPG's and have never played Persona 4 you're really missing out if you don't pick it up(it often sells for $20 in most places), and is easily the best JRPG on the Vita. I'm currently playing Tales of Hearts R(about 15 hours in) and I'm really enjoying it. It starts off a bit slow and there's no English voice acting, but it's a fun game.  I ultimately decided against purchasing Octodad since it's supposedly only 2-3 hours long, and I know it will probably go on sale soon, or end up as a free PS+ title."
vita,3dcwui,ZebraMuffin,2,Wed Jul 15 08:17:32 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention I have Shin Megami Tensei 4 (spelling?) for the 3DS, how does Persona 4 Golden compare to that?"
vita,3dcwui,ZebraMuffin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:32:07 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Shin Megami Tensei 4 yet, though based on previous experience with the series I can say they're similar, but different at the same time. The Shin Megami Tensei main series is usually darker, while Persona is a bit more light-hearted(though it does deal with dark subject matter). Persona also has a social element, where by spending time with others you can increase your social rank with that person/group, which allows you to create more powerful Persona(would be the equivalent to the demons you can fuse/convince to join you in the SMT main series)."

vita,3dcwui,qchto,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"According to this website, just completing the main story would take around 70 hours. Going for 100% completion would take about 140 hours.  It can be a very long game if you want it to be."

vita,3dcwui,buzzair1001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well, apart from the demons/personas names and the basic skill names, I'd say they don' really compare at all, here are some key differences:   P4 is a very story-driven game, all endings are easily obtainable if you save before a certain point, while SMTIV is more of a character and environment exploration centered story. Also, is worth mentioning that here is where P4 VN styled story telling shines. Dungeons in P4 are tower-styled randomly generated with a pretty straight-forward approach: go in, advance to the next checkpoint, go out, return, repeat until you find and battle the dungeon boss (which you can tell is a big difference with SMTIV approach). About P4 battle system, while retaining a 4 member party, weakness exploiting and buffing strategies, I'd consider it not as deep as SMTIV's as here every member has an independent turn with pretty much the same options as the MC (it's difficult to explain, but in P4 I found myself rushing into battles without much worry, while in IV I gave a lot of though before confronting a strong enemy - and even some weak ones). Also, worth mentioning, MC dying equals to game over in this game (being the only ruthless thing that P4 does in contrast with SMTIV). And finally, the pretty much redundant statement: P4 is a much more light-hearted game than any other SMT game (the covers alone gives this hint).   TL;DR: Your enjoyment of SMTIV is quite unlikely to define your enjoyment of P4, and viceversa. As a pure JRPG, I found SMTIV much more appealing than P4, but this in no way means it is a lesser game and is definitely worth a try. Just be clear that P4 strength comes from its story-heavy VN scenes and its seamless integration to its main RPG mechanics."
vita,3dcwui,aqeeliz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:37:29 2015 UTC,"Japanese voices only makes it better! Well, as long as they are done well and fit the character cause often times they don't.  All the Tales games start off slow so I'm not too worried about that.  What other Tales of games are there for the Vita?  Or is it just Hearts?   And what, in your opinion, makes Persona 4 Golden the best JRPG on the Vita over others like Tales of Hearts? What about RPGs in general? I'm also playing through (and loving) the Suikodens at the moment. If you've played them, which game would you say is closest to them from the ones I'm looking at?"
vita,3dcwui,MarcheM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"I think that's it. There's another one that was released in Japan(it released before Tales of Hearts R did over there), but apparently it wasn't as good and had technical issues so they decided not to localize it.   And what, in your opinion, makes Persona 4 Golden the best JRPG on the Vita over others like Tales of Hearts?   Persona 4 on PS2, and the remake/updated version Persona 4 Golden are easily the best JRPG game I've played in the past 10 years. There's a reason why if you search for other recommendation threads in this subreddit it's always at the top of every list. It's also the highest rated game on the Vita according to Metacritic.  Here's some descriptions I've given to people in the past that might help give you an idea about the game:  I honestly don't think I've ever met anyone who was open-minded, and enjoys JRPGs that disliked P4G, male or female. Even many non-JRPG fans I've spoken to loved that game.  It has a typical dungeon grind type gameplay, with a miniboss, and boss at the halfway/end point of each dungeon. When not grinding in the dungeons(which are randomly generated each time you enter, or re-enter them), it also has a modern country Japanese town to explore/buy items in.  When not grinding, or advancing the plot the game has a social aspect where you spend time with characters in the game to increase your relationship with them. By doing this, it allows you to fuse more powerful Persona. The game is kind of a mix between a typical dungeon RPG, a social simulator, and Pokemon.  The game does follow a teenage male student, who can choose to date females in the game once your reach a specific relationship level with each one. You can also choose to just be their friends, the relationship status is never explicitly forced on the player. If the player wishes, they can choose to date all of the females, but this can lead to issues farther down the line.  Based on what you've seen of the game, you might assume it's your typical JRPG game, but it does a lot to break new ground in the genre, especially story. The game has some sexual jokes, there's even a Persona that is shaped like a green penis(search ""Persona 4 Mara"" if you wish to see how tame/offensive it may be) and has a couple of main characters who deal with coming to terms with their own sexuality, and gender identity.   The first few hours are a little slow, as there's little game-play while the storyline/characters are introduced, but it quickly picks up speed as you, and a diverse cast of teenagers, in a small country town attempt to solve a murder mystery.  As I said, it has a diverse cast that will likely grow on you fast. It also is one of the few games I've found that deals with some tough subjects, in a somewhat light-hearted, but respectful manner."

vita,3dcwui,Jack_Hat,2,Wed Jul 15 08:32:53 2015 UTC,"Not completely sure as I've not played SMT4, but Persona 4 combines dungeon crawling with social side of things. You create social links between yourself and the people you meet in the world and these help you in fusing personas and making your party members have more actions during combat.  The game happens over a single year and you get to choose what you want to do and who you spend time with on most days (some days are storydriven so you can't choose activities on those). Around once a month you get a new dungeon and you have a few weeks to beat it (you can do them in a single day if you want to/are strong enough).  I've played other SMT games in the past, but Persona 3 and 4 are the top ones in my opinion."

It's more of an action RPG but there's no visual novel aspect to the game as far as I know.  There are also tons of classics in the store if that's your thing.  Everything from Final Fantasys to Suikodens.

You have a pretty limited party sized, set weapons (you just upgrade them), limited spell slots, and like two or three side quests total. Even the maps are smaller. That may sound bad, but it is PERFECT for the Vita's on the move functionality. You can even save mid battle. The characters are cute, the animation still holds up, and the story is fantastic.

In first-person RPGs you're playing from the eyes of the main character -- such as Skyrim and Fallout, although they also let you view from third-person. Google ""first-person RPG"" and you'll see a good list of examples on the top of the results page.  Similarly to Earthbound on SNES, Citizens of Earth has a top-down view, like a lot of JRPGs on older systems. Nothing about that game is first-person, unless the language defining genres has changed drastically over the years, which doesn't appear to be the case after some quick Googling."

In Mother games up till 3 you don't really see your characters in combat, but you do in the overworld (but it makes sense to). The same can be said for DQ games up to 7 or 8 I believe, and games like Etrian Odyssy or Persona 1 and 2.

So instead the item is £2 and buy one get one free.  I imagine Amazon are using the RRP to make their sale look better, rather than their regular price which might actually be cheaper than the sale price."
vita,3dcp2z,Banana_Kama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:43:55 2015 UTC,"Happens all the time when Amazon has one of these super-deal-days. They claim massive discounts - but those are usually against prices that the product did never actually cost or at least not since a long time. I guess often those are the ""manufacturer recommended prices"" at release..."
vita,3dcp2z,og1L,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:00:42 2015 UTC,I noticed that too. I was in the market for a 32 Gb card and saw the list price jumped like $8 a few days prior to the sale.

That way, they could include lots of discounts in Amazon Pantry and old-stock cheap jewelry and they didn't have to lie to anyone.   I won't be paying attention to Prime Day next year, unless they field enough bad press for this one to make them want to be more honest in their portrayals."

Was hoping for some better game deals.  Last Black Friday I remember buying PSP games I didn't have for 9.99.    Prime isn't a waste though.

I'm assuming the mindset is that the ps4 user base is so much higher than Vita that they're hedging bets and going ps4. I know it's not promised but I'm buying it in hopes of both a vita purchase and the cross download is free in the future. Until then I'll remote play it.

They then released n+ in 2008 which was released on xbla Nintendo DS and PSP.  They also updated the pc/web version to n 2.0 in 2013, which is the latest version you can play or download here  finally n++ is going to be the newest version released on PS4.

vita,3d93yh,matrixagent,-10,Tue Jul 14 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"It's a very very basic game with very very basic graphics, it's got no complex game mechanics it's the most basic form of platformer there is.

vita,3d93yh,Thulsa790,7,Tue Jul 14 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"It's not a very basic game at all. Sigh. Why do people always equate simple with basic? Different screen estate alone could mean the assets (and more importantly the levels) would have to be recreated. Read some of their blog posts to learn about how hard it was to get it to 60fps on PS4. The Vita is less powerful. Sure, it might be fairly easy to ""get it running"" on the Vita, but that's jack shit. It most certainly is not at all easy to make a Vita version that's equally perfect, and we shouldn't want any less. The developers certainly don't want any less, judging by the development and outcome on the PS4."

As of now I seem to get around 3.5 hours of play with brightness cranked pretty high, wi-fi on, and a little bit of volume.  Not bad, but it still lasts on standby forever (which is something I can't say for the 3DS)"
vita,3ddega,Xephon7,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"My OLED's battery went to absolute shit after about 2 years. It couldn't even tell how much juice it had and would regularly jump between full, half and empty (to the point of shutting down, then being at half or full when switched back on) within minutes.  I replaced it with a slim and could not be happier! I didn't realise how uncomfortable the OLED was to hold until I used a slim for a while, and that extra battery means I've not used it more than it can handle in a day since i got it over a year ago.  Folks worry about the screen ""downgrade"" but honestly, after you've got rid of the old one (and can no longer look at them side by side) it's completely negligable."

vita,3dbuya,Sogeman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:51 2015 UTC,it's a shame the vita uses vita specific cards and they are so price gouged. it took me forever to get another card. I bought an 8gb card on sale for like 2 dollars in sears one day and recently bought a 64gb. I'd say look around locally a lot for the cards on sale first. you can find them online a lot if you're willing to take a bit to look around also.

vita,3da640,mkvaladez,10,Tue Jul 14 18:26:35 2015 UTC,Escalated the support ticket. Pushed that their flimsy ass sticker shouldn't stop you from getting it fixed. I have not known a single electronic device like this in many years that don't have the serial number in the firmware somewhere. I do not believe for a second the serial is only on that sticker.  I'd get ahold of them again and really push the issue. You paid money for their product they need to stand behind it instead of making excuses. If the serial sticker wore off that's their fault for relying on a crap sticker in a bad spot.

After an hour of over the phone trying to get them to accept it, I gave up, went to the place where I bought it and they accepted it no questions asked. A month later I had a brand new 1000 Vita (was expecting a 2000 model, since this took place a few months ago).  Sony can go to hell, they truly do hate Vita owners."

vita,3da640,Harry050502,3,Tue Jul 14 18:29:12 2015 UTC,It's almost like they designed that sticker to fall off after a few months so they can deny warranty. Mine fell off after 3-4 months and I looked after my Vita

vita,3d99e8,BroDuck,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:29:17 2015 UTC,Understandable but still disappointing. What about if you played the Jap version of the game? Does that still mean it can't be talked about till US release?  I'm just itching for an awesome new game with elements different then what we currently have for the vita.
vita,3d99e8,mcsluethburg,0,Tue Jul 14 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"If the japanese version of the game is out already I don't see why people would be embargoed for that.

vita,3d99e8,Reset_Tears,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"I've heard the game is repetitive,   Hmmm, this could be a killer or it can be looked past depending on the game. Bravery Default was repetitive but I was able to look past it but I know what you mean. I'm still excited but want to hear/see more before I commit."
vita,3d99e8,C1V,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:29 2015 UTC,There was a bunch of discussion on this board when the game was announced.. mostly to say that the Japanese thought the game sucked ass.. Check any Japanese website and you won't see a single positive review.. I'm sad the vita doesn't have a lot of solid game right now but there's no way I'm wasting money on this game..
vita,3d99e8,C1V,2,Tue Jul 14 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Browsing through some Japanese reviews, here's some general impressions I've gotten:   The balance of combat is good, and it's fun to level up your characters.  Great variety of skills for the various characters. Some really like the music. Some don't care for the character designs. (I personally like them, but opinions.) The game seems on the short side. (But also, you might need to play through the story at least twice?) Some find the gameplay repetitive and too easy. Some are greatly disappointed if it's their favorite character who turns out to be the traitor.   Basically, I think it's as I've guessed; it'll be a game enjoyable enough for fans of the genre, but won't be turning a lot of heads otherwise. Of course, it'll be much easier to find out more once it's actually released in English -- localization can have a big effect on a game's quality, and it's possible the Western market (among the niche fanbase of anime-style RPG fans at least) could attach to the title more than the Japanese. The game does take place in New York I believe? And the art style is much less ""moe"" than many other titles of the genre."

vita,3d99e8,alleycw,2,Thu Jul 16 12:52:05 2015 UTC,Hey C1V. A quick google search showed that that Jap version was a little over 1GB but there hasn't been a definite size for the US release yet. I'd say that it would be in that general area.

vita,3d99e8,ZebraMuffin,0,Tue Jul 14 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"I was excited when I first heard about it, but it looked boring from some gameplay videos so I decided to drop interest. There's plenty of other games out there."
vita,3d99e8,mateusrayje,0,Wed Jul 15 01:27:00 2015 UTC,"I played the Japanese demo and the game seemed good. Very reminiscent of Valkyria Chronicles, though perhaps a bit simpler in some ways. I like the art style, music, and general premise of the game. (I'm especially intrigued by the traitor-finding system.) I think it will be enjoyable for fans of the genre.  No idea how the story will fare -- it does seem to be a pretty average plot."

It's pretty all or nothing on the combat front (there are a few balance issues), and I'm not sure I like the characters as much as, say, Virtue's Last Reward, but overall pretty enjoyable.

Aesthetically, you're asking us if we believe that you'll enjoy seeing a cool graphic on your system instead of having an extra Benjamin in your pocket.  There is no way that anyone here can answer that for you.    If you think seeing the cool looking system is worth $100 more, buy it.  If not, don't.  We can't tell you your opinion though."

vita,3dafr6,rutherne,3,Tue Jul 14 21:19:36 2015 UTC,Theres no P4G edition of the vita. Its simply the P4DAN edition. I wouldnt spend that much money on a vita unless youre a diehard fan of the series. I have it but i cant recommend it to anyone else unless youre a huge persona fan like myself.
vita,3dafr6,NateDizzle312,3,Tue Jul 14 20:45:23 2015 UTC,"Hell I would consider myself a diehard fan and I still wouldn't buy it. I can just a decal or the ""Disco Fever"" edition that comes with a skin."
vita,3dafr6,rutherne,2,Tue Jul 14 21:12:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I think I'll take your advice and get a regular vita or a colored vita that's close in price. I love the series but not enough to merit buying persona-themed extras.
vita,3dafr6,ow_meer,3,Tue Jul 14 21:15:25 2015 UTC,Just buy some persona theme decals and not only will it make your vita look cool but it will protect it from scratches too.

vita,3dafr6,minimur12,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who spent $315 on the Premium Crazy Box, I don't regret it at all. Hell I already had a Vita 1000 and I still feel it's worth it, but I'm the type of guy where if I see something and really fall in love with it, it becomes like a new child that I baby the crap out of. For me the aesthetics were worth the extra ≈$235 it cost me (I sold the crazy box inside after getting about a dozen or so hours out of the game since I wanted to wait for the US release).  But this is just me, I can't speak for how you feel about it, though I liked it enough to buy a whole other vita. (If your worried about how the colors turn out they look just like the pictures, very nice, and as an added bonus, even if you use a NA psn account on it, you can keep the persona theme as it's preloaded instead of a download code unlike many of the other special editions)"

Edit: No need to PM.  This grip feels pretty good to me.  Definitely feels more natural than the L2/R2 grip I had previously.  Like the reviews said, the plastic is cheap, but it still feels pretty nice.  The one I got is broken, or the locking clip does absolutely nothing because I can move the slider up and down no matter what position the lock is in.  Thankfully, it stays in whatever position you move it to so my Vita won't be falling out.  I feel like I got my money's worth with this thing."

vita,3d97ac,feladirr,4,Tue Jul 14 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"given the high cost of storage space on the Vita, and it's limited compatibility with different video formats, I have not found it worthwhile to put videos on the Vita. I put them on my phone or a tablet instead.   Back in the day I put tons of movies on my PSP, and, and I used all sorts of different software. Handbrake was a good free option. I would imagine it is also a good option for the Vita."

I'd do the same but my girlfriend has the tablet and my phone's screen is cracked so all that's left is my Vita with 32GB storage with around 6GB of it free. I've managed to get two movies and few tv episodes onto the card. The quality could be better, but it's to be expected when the size is only a fraction of what it used to be.  Thanks for the link, I'll try it out as well."

A 20-30GB BluRay rip is just a waste of space on the Vita. If you use Handbrake to rip at the Standard quality it should look great on the Vita. You can also save space by only including the stereo audio track."

vita,3d97ac,tylerwallacebrooks,2,Tue Jul 14 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"Go into the vita, look at the videos app.  There will be an option for PC.  It then tells you to pug your vita into the computer.  At this point, the vita will install the needed program onto the computer.  Once that program is installed, any video files will be under the PC name in the video app.  Again, you must be on the same network as the PC, and if the PC is somehow hidden, you may not find it.  This was a pretty simple process, but I did look at youtube to figure this out."

vita,3d8e7u,crazyguzz1,7,Tue Jul 14 08:45:27 2015 UTC,"Trails in the Sky was a great one for me. It was the first JRPG I ever beat (I actually used to hate them as a kid), and the one that sucked me into the vast world of JRPGs.  Amazing story, and the only grinding I did really was just getting a few extra levels to make sure I was prepared for the final boss. Other than that though, I didn't really need to grind for anything.   I would also highly recommend the Ys series as well. While not a traditional turn based game, it's more of a hack and slash game. The newer games have Time Attack modes, and multiple levels of difficulty, up to the soul crushing Nightmare mode.    I actually just played through Ys I+II Chronicles this week, and the games are VERY short, and very fun and enjoyable, though your enjoyment of the ""Bump"" combat may depend. Some people hate it, but some people like myself love it (The newer titles don't have this system anymore)."
vita,3d8e7u,Ebonlocke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:59:55 2015 UTC,-- Trails is the answer.
vita,3d8e7u,ArchmageXin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"Trails in the Sky was a great one for me.    I've been meaning to try this game, but I missed out on it the last time it went on sale and I've been holding out hoping for another sale(I'm in no rush, I have a ton of Vita games in my backlog).   I'm hoping we see a sale this week, since the Asia PSN store is currently having a sale(source ) which includes both the first, and second game in the series at 50% off.  Hopefully it goes on sale before Trails of Cold Steel releases, as that game looks really good to me. I know the stories aren't directly tied together, but I'd prefer to play them in order(excluding the third game in the series, which hasn't had localization announced)."
vita,3d8e7u,ZebraMuffin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:32:43 2015 UTC,"Trails has some quality of life features that are great for anyone who wants an easy game too. Everytime you wipe you get thrown back into the same fight with no progress lost, with the option to make the fight slightly easier each time. And exp gains scale based on the level difference between you and an enemy, so it's hard to get underleveled."
vita,3d8e7u,Cake__Attack,10,Tue Jul 14 17:01:39 2015 UTC,"Child of Light, absolutely.  It's relatively short for an RPG (~10 hours or so) and there's little you can do wrong at normal difficulty. I think I didn't die a single time when I was playing through it, but still had a lot of fun. Only the final boss battle was a bit of a challenge but I still managed to beat the boss on my first attempt."
vita,3d8e7u,otaku-asia,6,Tue Jul 14 09:25:13 2015 UTC,Child of light?

Everyone enjoys games for different reasons.  For some, it's just the story that captivates them.  Others, it's that sense of accomplishment when they win after getting their asses handed to them over and over.    Do what you enjoy, and to hell with anyone that tells you otherwise.  If you like playing on easy because you prefer the story and gameplay over the difficulty, then by golly you go whollop them imps into puddles of goo!"
vita,3d8e7u,ishkabibbel2000,3,Tue Jul 14 16:08:42 2015 UTC,I thought Hyperdimension Neptunia was super easy and very satisfying. I dont remember needing to grind or getting killed by any main story boss or creature.
vita,3d8e7u,PhilXY,2,Tue Jul 14 14:16:04 2015 UTC,"Just platinum'd Rebirth;1, it definitely requires some grinding as it has a difficulty spike around late ch.2 or 3 (I can't recall which, or at least until you hit lvl.25) but is fine from there on out."
vita,3d8e7u,ultra7k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, once you get past the first few chapters, it's not too bad. Additionlly, using the weaken enemies plan will let you beat enemies 5-10 levels below what you should regularly need."

However if you do ever feel in the mood to grind and get more from your game, some of the optional non-story bosses do reward you for it."
vita,3d8e7u,Shinjiro_Aragaki,6,Tue Jul 14 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"Different system, but here's my opportunity to confess my love for...  FINAL FANTASY MYSTIC QUEST.  There, I said it, it's out there. Yes, I love FFMQ with fond nostalgia glasses as my entry Final Fantasy. Deal with it."

But I think the random encounters were more than enough practice for a grind. Oh yeah, Ys Memories of Celceta is pretty easy. Never grinded on that one, and I played on Normal difficulty. You can just keep using potions to heal yourself if you were ever in a bind."
vita,3d8e7u,Martin15Sleith,2,Tue Jul 14 09:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, for easier jrpg, i would recommend brave story for the psp, wich is an otherwise clasicc jrpg storyline with a few twists here an there, that makes it a pretty memorable game, another recommendation would be, dragon quest 1, wich is the shortest and otherwise ""easiest"" of the saga (short, not a lot of grindibg needed, easy enemies, well most of them aniways...(insert omnius música here))"
vita,3d8e7u,Vebrendos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Um... Dragon Quest 1 is basically all grinding, if I remember correctly."

My first playthrough, I missed over half of the skills and weapons in the game, but had no problems beating it."

vita,3d8e7u,MDL5667,0,Fri Jul 17 21:00:02 2015 UTC,I would say any final fantasy game.  I have never gotten mad or stuck in a ff game. I know some of the hidden summons and bosses in the newer ones can be challenging but they were never so hard were I had to take a break due to frustration

vita,3d8e7u,KasGiD,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"(Not Vita related but)I'd have to say The World Ends With You. It was a rather easy and fun game to play. Sure I had to grind but grinding in that game was actually pretty fun. They made the fighting and Encounter mechanic really interesting. For fighting it used the DS's Dual screen to the best of its ability and it was amazing with how they did. You controlled the bottom screen with your stylus and the top screen with the D Pad. You aren't good at it the character on the top screen can goto auto if remained idle for too long. And the way they did encounters was great too. Like you never saw the enemies unless you touched the ""Player Pin"". It gave you control over encounter rate. And instead of just fighting one enemy at a time you can click on them on that are on the screen and you can have a combo encounter which shortens grinding time in a way. But what made grinding fun for me was not just the fighting mechanic but it was the art style and the Music. The music was a key point for me. The music changed frequently which made grinding less boring and less repetitive. It was a game I could play even after I beat the game or 100% it (Which I'll never do and I'm still trying to). You can also change the difficulty whenever you feel like it and also adjust your level. It's a game I recommend to anyone with a DS."

In the first place, I'm unsure whether or not there will be a successor. There's a slim model for the vita, so buy that if that's what you're looking for.  Remote play's a great feature from what I've heard. While you're at it, try out some of the games vita has to offer. Some people bought it purely for remote play and then got addicted to their vita.

I'm really excited for what's coming to PlayStation with the Morpheus project and the Move trending back a little. I just don't want to buy one and have something new come out.  Either way I think that if they haven't announced anything there shouldn't be anything coming out for another 5 months right? Maybe a christmas announcement."
vita,3dcs2a,NeoJ4K3,2,Wed Jul 15 06:59:40 2015 UTC,There is actually a slim version of the vita.
vita,3dcs2a,NeoJ4K3,2,Wed Jul 15 08:03:36 2015 UTC,"The vita has reached it's 3rd birthday (lol) so i don't think that a true console successor is in the cards yet.  At worst, the game library is going nowhere, and the library is FANTASTIC, so even if a successor is anounced for some crazy reason, the vita has a huge slew of new games coming and plenty of old catalouge games to keep you busy for sure.    Just my two cents on the 1000 vs the 2000, As much as I love the OLED screen and the thicker form factor, i feel that the Slim model is superior.  The LCD isn't worse than the OLED, it is just different and the extra battery life really makes it worth it.  The slim design is very nice, and generally you can't go wrong with it.  I think that the longer battery life alone is worth getting a slim over the fat."
vita,3dcs2a,Sasuke082594,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:00:08 2015 UTC,How improved is the battery life? And how would you rate the slim version's screen compared to the other one? I can't decide /:
vita,3dcs2a,Sasuke082594,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I dont think the oled screen is better than the lcd, just differnt. On a rating they would both earn an 8 out of twn in my eyea. Both have plusses and minuses. If you have never owned a vita, you wouldnt even see difference at all in lcd if you opted for that one.   GEneral word is the battery life is about 1-2 houra better. That can be stetched even further depending on your settings (brihtness, speaker vokume, airplan mode etc)"

vita,3dcufr,otaku-asia,2,Wed Jul 15 07:45:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's a shame that you cannot change your country but I assume it's mostly due to technical restrictions. Sony has subsidiaries and the PlayStation regions are split into SCEA, SCEE, SCEJA, among others.  Let's say you wanted to change your region from UK to the US, what would happen to content that you previously purchased from the UK regional store? It would no longer be available for re-download because it's not necessarily available on the US store.  It's just an assumption but it's probably a lot more complicated than it appears first. Personally I'd be happy if they allowed multiple accounts on the Vita, just like they do on the PS3/PS4. :)"

vita,3d7lvn,InYourHands,8,Tue Jul 14 03:34:20 2015 UTC,"Can't say I'm a fan of the recent trend in indie development to announce a project for 5 platforms, only develop for 2 and then act shocked when it doesn't work on the other 3. If early on in your project you intend to hit multiple platforms, one would think designing your game to accommodate that would be key.    For those keeping score at home, here's the axed indie list for Vita (off the top of my head): - Road Not Taken - Gun's Up (hilariously, this one is published by Sony) - Nom Nom Galaxy - Hand of Fate - Galak-Z"
vita,3d7lvn,2BFLiam,12,Tue Jul 14 03:36:47 2015 UTC,Road not Taken was super duper not their fault. Autodesk decided to stop supporting Vita with Scaleform during the development of the game.
vita,3d7lvn,ZCAvian,3,Tue Jul 14 04:55:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It doesn't look good for anyone, and just pisses off people who were looking forward to it when you announce ""Whoops, lol, can't do it"".

vita,3d7lvn,LoSouLibra,3,Tue Jul 14 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think all these devs are just not doing the Vita version anymore because they don't see any profit in it, or just a way to break even, and are using technical problems as a cover. Sony pulling out on what middleware and software the system supports probably doesn't help either. I'll be surprised if they ever finish making the tools needed for Axiom Verge to ever happen.  I can already see people (me included) getting so mad when Bloodstained finally releases, if they backed for the physical Vita version, and the Vita port gets cancelled."
vita,3d7lvn,zaikman,4,Tue Jul 14 11:43:03 2015 UTC,"Galak-Z dev here. You're welcome to think what you want, but the honest truth is that we sincerely want to put it on Vita but have been unable to par the game down to fit on the device without losing most of what makes the game good. People see a '2D game' and expect that 'of course it should run on the Vita', but there's a lot going on under the hood. Complex physics, intelligent squad-based AI, dynamic music, etc.  Believe me, our goal is to make high-quality games that are enjoyable to play on whatever platform they're on. If profit was our motivation, we would have shoveled Galak-Z out a year ago rather than taking the time to make it good."
vita,3d7lvn,LoSouLibra,4,Tue Jul 14 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"I understood that in what I read in the twitter comments, and I don't think like that about perspective and tech, but I'm sure a much healthier system would have incentivised an alternative version or spin off, if nothing else. I ain't mad atcha, though. A couple years of work like that for something only on Vita, at this point, would not only land a small team in the poor house, but also reach so few people by 2017+ that the idea of it even being enjoyed and appreciated by players is barely there for motivation anymore. Especially if you think any compromise won't be fun at all. Plus, by the time Galax-Z is finished, you'll probably want to work on something else. If any further iteration and brainstorming were to happen with more Galax-Z development, ""Galax-Z 2/Ultra"" would probably be a better candidate for creativity than ""Galax-Z Pocket"" anyway."
vita,3d7lvn,Silidus,2,Tue Jul 14 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"I really hope the best for you guys, but I think I speak for a lot of users when I say that the Vita is my Indi-gaming platform.  Don't get me wrong, I think its great that the PS4 is supporting the smaller/interesting games, but when it comes right down to it and I have an hour to sit on my couch and play something, it's going to be  ESO/Batman/TLoU  That said, I put WAAAAAY more hours on my vita than I ever do on my PS4, and the bulk of my gaming time is spent in Helldivers/Spelunkey/Rogue Legacy......"
vita,3d7lvn,zaikman,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well wishes. It sucks, because I wish we could deliver something for you guys that didn't feel like a terrible, stripped down port, but that's what it would end up being.  It's not 100% out of the question, it's just on hold indefinitely while we finish up the PS4 version and prepare for the PC launch."

Plus, if anything ever doesn't deliver it's Vita goal, the current ""your system's dead, deal with it and stop asking for stuff"" brigade would come out to squelch any outrage online, instead of supporting it like they would with any other broken promise on kickstarter.  I'll believe it when I see it, because we still haven't even seen stuff as far back as Hyper Light Drifter and Shantae yet, to even see a kickstarter Vita tier materialize and I've still got to keep my fingers crossed that Mighty No 9 port actually happens. Anything that's still cropping up and slated for 2017 or later with a Vita stretch goal in NA/EU? I'd love to believe it, but I can't."

vita,3d7lvn,LoSouLibra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"Vita's always had an amazing attach rate for it's user base, but a small user base nonetheless. I remember all those stupid comments too, but I think even a lot of those people are getting used to indie games now, and it's probably starting to become a good space to sell on PS4. I couldn't tell you, though. I'm sure crossbuy titles make the numbers hard to read, too. Either way, I'm 100% certain that the early ""Playstation <3's Indies"" marketing for PS4 launch stemmed from Vita owners supporting and clamoring for indies so much with stuff like #BestOnVita and initiatives to get indie games and devs on board with the system."

I find remote play to be fantastic even with R2/L2 on the back touchpad for most games - some games have good custom control remaps for remote play. If you really want more physical R2/L2, check out the cool grip for the Vita slim. I've used remote play extremely well within the same home and even from 400 miles away with minimal issues. I have not used the Vita to play any PS Now games, but I have used PS Now on the PS4 and it was pretty good with my connection (played the first Uncharted over a 50 mbps connection with no problems). I cannot comment further than what I stated in #1 about the R2/L2. No plans announced and I would not hold my breath for it - the PS4 doesn't even have PS2 games available yet digitally, just the PS3. Probably will never happen."

It is implemented in PSTV and both that and Vita seem to share the same operating system. The dualshock is recognized as a controller, using bluetooth, so I would assume that all it needs is some sort of button mapping lookup - but I'm no expert. I was really pleased to find 19k other people who also want it already so hopefully if enough people vote it will happen. It is in number 3 place so it isn't as if it isn't on their radar - we just need to show that interest isn't fading!"

I had heard about data coruption on vita memory cards and thought these people were just some unlucky few.  Well i can tell you first hand it can happen to even the most careful. I have been collecting vita titles and accessories since launch, i currently have over 140 physical games and am still going, i have upgraded multiple times memory card wise, because the next size up just didnt cut it.    I currently have 2 (64gb) memory cards one for psp/minis and one for ps mobile/digital only/videos.    I also am an avid supporter of PS TV and play my vita stuff mostly on that and on the vita slim when im on the go.  Well this evening i began noticing that some of my games i planed to play were crashing upon bootup with the typical (error notice saying the vita had problems opening that game and to send an error report to sony.) Both 64gb cards are less than 3 minths old and purchased from a reputable importer.    So i went through the (try to rebuild / repair the databse system on the memory card, ....... fail, half the games would work the other half would crash at bootup.  And it changed with every reboot of the vita. One would be fixed and a different one was now corrupted).    Long story short, i tried everything sony and chat forums suggested with no stable success, Hell i couldnt even backup my dam saves on any of these games.  Lost it all!  Had to format the card and begin redownloading everything.    You can backup to your pc most everything on the vita memory cards but it had been about 1 month since i had updated that backup.  Soooooo i get the enjoyable task of redownloading over 20GB of digital only games, 2GB worth of updates for those games and about 500MB worth of DLC and that is after i have already restored what i did have backed up on my PC to the memory card.  What was originally a minor inconvenience turned into about 15hrs worth of redownloading CRAP!  Here is the final kicker for this story.   If i had a physical copy of the game i would be saving myself tons of time NOT needing to redownload the game, just any small updates and DLC.   Thats GIGS worth of content i wouldnt have to redownload. All the backing up processes Sony has in place for you and your Vita REQUIRE that you have an internet connection while doing a backup or restore to validate your purchase licenses with thier servers.............. what happens 5 to 7 years from now when those servers are shut down or tasked for something else?  Even if you have all your digital content backed up on a PC you cant transfer it back and forth CURRENTLY without thier servers!  Unless they change that before they shut them down, all your digital purchases are worthless if your memory card dies and you need to replace it, or you unit dies and you replace that.  Cant assign your PSN account to a Vita without the Servers can you.   Basicly take back control of your consumer rites when they stop supporting this thing or else you will be left with a gaming console that can do vertually nothing."

The box itself I feel is just as much part of the game as the game itself. It shows the care put by the artist and company.  But really, I just like sitting back and seeing my collection grow. It's a nice thing.  Call me a non-gamer, but if a physical copy isn't available in my preferred region, I'll chase it down in another region. I may even buy a game multiple times.

I love collecting games just as much as playing them. Why does it matter to you? Or perhaps some people aren't able to consistently pay $40 everytime a game come out? You do understand the concept that physical items retain some value after their initial release and can be sold, yes?   The reasons why are basic and abundent, regardless people shouldn't need to justify their decisions to buy something to anyone. I'm not just directing this to just you, mind you. This topic comes up alot. But sorry, I don't believe for a second that you don't understand why people would only go physical.

All contained in 8""x7""x2"" - which is about the size of a hardback book, or a small lunchbox or purse."
vita,3d8huj,timborobot,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:02 2015 UTC,You know that actually looks like a pretty good bag  If I had any physical copies this would definitely be up on my to buy list :P  But yeah the convenience of just picking up my Vita and play whatever I want instantly is the reason I love it sooo damn much!
vita,3d8huj,haXona,2,Tue Jul 14 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"Haha exactly, my Vita will probably die befote I cant access my games so digotal all the way for me."
vita,3d8huj,haXona,3,Tue Jul 14 13:51:58 2015 UTC,"I actually go the opposite direction. I won't buy a game if there is no digital release. PC, PS3, PS4 or VITA - it doesn't matter. No way I would trade the ability to download the game right away and then redownload it from anywhere for a worthless physical copy that will just collect dust and take space on my shelf.  Also for PS3 it's the matter of the drive noise, which I can't stand. And no - I'm not afraid of not being able to download the game in 30 years later, because PSN will be down. I'm pretty sure I'll not care about these games in 30 years.   Now if only PSN would be as good in terms of usability as Steam. But hey, it's good enough."

vita,3d8huj,Martin15Sleith,2,Tue Jul 14 10:29:08 2015 UTC,"Price is a main reason for me. Australian pricing is really expensive. Digital sales are great, but at launch I can get most games for a third of their price if I import a physical copy."
vita,3d8huj,AverageTheJam,2,Tue Jul 14 10:34:55 2015 UTC,"Just got my pink Vita (OT: Import was 210 € w/ shipping and taxes to Germany while you can get a black one for ~160-170 € or 210 € with 8GB card and 10 DLC games, but the color <3). Originally I wanted to go full physical and already ordered 4 UK (UK because I hate the rating logos on German boxes), 2 US and 1 JP game before the console even arrived. But now I'm thinking to go mostly digital, because I like to switch between the games all the time and switching vita cartridges is not that convenient. Probably I'll only buy JP/US import games, so I can play them without switching PSN accounts, and buy the rest from the PSN store except games that are super expensive there. (e.g. I paid 21,39 € for Most Wanted (US Ver) including overseas shipping, on the PSN store they ask 49,99 € for that game.) Too bad I already ordered Terraria (UK). That's a game that I want to play in between, so a digital edition is much more pleasant. And it's only 7,50€ (Sale) on PSN, I paid 22,49 € for the retail edition. It hasn't arrived yet, so I'm thinking about keeping it shrink-wrapped and sell it again later. Another reason is, that full-retail is not possible. Many games are digital-only."

It's an archival issue for me. I have all my video games going back to the NES and I can still play all of them. Some day I will want to do that with my then-old Vita games and if PSN isn't available to re-download, a memory card fails, a Vita console fails and needs replaced, or any other scenario you can think of happens, digital games are gone."
vita,3d8huj,anh86,2,Tue Jul 14 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"Your question feels loaded.  There are many reason why I favor physical copies, as mentioned over and over. I place more value in my consumer right, and as a collector over the convenience I'll never take advantage of. I only play one game at a time, so I don't need to carry my collection wherever I go.  Also, I will do everything I can as a consumer to discourage the whole digital-only future because it's not a friendly one. I do not wish to pay anywhere near full price for digital because I don't think it's worth it.  I have multiple system (pretty much everything but any Xbox Systems). So, I honestly don't have time nor money for every single game. If a publishers doesn't see me as a consumer worth pursuing, then I can't see them as someone worth doing business with when there are so many publishers out there who are pumping out physical.  Finally, I'm not 100% against digital only. I do have a price, and it's floats around $5. So when a digital only game drops down to that price, and I'm still interested, I'll buy. Otherwise, I'll keep playing other games."
vita,3d8huj,MasterInterface,2,Tue Jul 14 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"Some people just do not have the time to go to their local GameStop... And perhaps they do not want to wait for the physical copy to arrive in the mail.    I, for one, used to think the way of some of these people here - physical copies only!!!    Now I realize the pure convenience of buying a game in a web browser, setting it to download, and walking into my home with a new game ready to play.  There is value there for me."
vita,3d8huj,tylerwallacebrooks,3,Tue Jul 14 14:07:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP. THe games should be more important then the delivery method.  Nothing wrong with buying all available physical copies over digital. But losing out on experiences you would enjoy because it doesn't merit a print run does not mean vita has no games. it means you aren't just in it for the pixels after all.   that said, no reason to pay full digital price on most games either. wait for a sale."
vita,3d8huj,Evilmeevilyou,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:13 2015 UTC,Digital. The convenience of throwing just my vita in a travel bag and not a bunch of games is great.  I have as many DS games as Vita and currently don't know where most my DS games are.  Vita games are safe on the system
vita,3d8huj,Vagabond_Sam,3,Tue Jul 14 14:17:56 2015 UTC,Because I rather have physical media than be dependent on PSN working or not if I want to download it and I don't have money for 64 GB memory card   is your collection more important than being a gamer?   oh and fuck you
vita,3d8huj,wielku,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty mixed with this. On all my consoles, I've got digital and physical games. On homeconsoles it doesn't really make any difference to me as changing the disc isn't that annoying to do, but on handhelds it's a bit different.   I started going more digital on the 3DS since it felt annoying to carry around loads of games just so I have the freedom of choice when I want to change games. Digital just seemed better and more convenient for that. Now that I also have a Vita, I have more digital games on it than physical games.  I've only got a 8gb memory card which means I don't have THAT much freedom of choice, but I've got a few good ones on it all the time. The games I've already played though are usually deleted to make room for games I haven't beaten yet."

Digital is more confortable way to store games, I've got 64 gb card full of games, but I also buy physical copies once they go really cheap."

vita,3d8huj,UNIXunderWear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:41:20 2015 UTC,"I have a few reasons for preferring physical, even if I'm not 100% digital or physical:   Like reading a book over reading it on an e-reader, part of the experience of a game for me is to purchase the case, crack it open, pop the cart/disc/whatever into the machine, and fire it up. So, I prefer picking up a physical release over digital. I like to build up a little collection and display it on my shelf. A bit superficial, but it's something I enjoy doing. I would rather fully, 100% own whatever game I purchase, rather than deal with all of the bullcrap associated with Digital Consumer Law. I would rather save the cash on a monstrous 64GB memory card and spend the money on used physical Vita games instead.   Those are the reasons off the top of my head. I won't avoid something if it is digital only (read: many indie games like Shovel Knight, Guacamalee, Binding of Isaac Rebirth etc.), but I strongly prefer picking up physical games rather than digital games."

vita,3d8huj,vHernandez31,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:50 2015 UTC,I like physical games for a lot of reasons  Digital games are always charged the same price on console. I can just go online and get a physical copy for cheaper anyways.  I like having a collection and games on the shelf. It's nice to be able to let a friend borrow a game whenever they want to play it.  I refuse to pay for those large memory cards. Sorry but no. I can't afford that.  I used to have Sega channel as a kid. Which was getting a different set of games every month on the Sega genesis. Some of the games on it no longer exist. Not even ROMs. Having the only way to play a game digital leaves a sour taste in my mouth because of this possibility.

vita,3d8huj,GunplaDan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"I can list a few.   Memory cards are overpriced, and backing up or redownloading a game when wanted, takes way longer than it should. Physical release to some might mean that people that a company has enough confidence in a game to put more money into it. A sense of security. If PSN ever decided to go away, having a physical copy for a game guarantees you can still play it.    Personally im not one of the ones that buys only physical games in general, and I can see the appeal of both sides, but I will always buy physical for a game to save some space on my 16GB memory card (physical PSO2 takes up over 8GB of that), and I will always buy the physical limited edition copies for games I love like Hyperdimension Neptunia.  /u/shadowdorothy has a good point too."

I will NOT buy a digital game that has had a physical release in another region, I will not be buying digimon for example as that should be a physical release.

It does not matter if you have all your games backed up because all your backups have DRM, the only way to play backup games is but putting them on a Vita that has been tied to your account, if there is no PSN which is something that can easily happen then you will not be able to log into your account to tie it to the Vita, you will not be able to use your backup games because of DRM.   Why is this so hard for people to except? Look at Atari which was HUGE and owned all of gaming and they are gone, look at Sega who were neck and neck with Nintendo not too long ago. If Sony get into big trouble which they were in only a few years ago then they could go the same way, do you think the debit collectors would keep the PSN servers running? Image if the PS4 was doing as bad as the Xbone, then Sony and the Playstation brand would be in massive trouble.  If you have your games on cart none of this is a worry because you just put a cart into ANY Vita and it will work.  Backups are uselesss with DRM and all the downvotes in the world will not change this fact, deal with it."

I buy my games digitally (unless physical is cheaper and easier) and have never had a problem or had to worry about a problem happening, that's not to say it doesn't happen because it does, but I think it's a LOT more common for someone to lose or break a game than for something to happen to it digitally and then be unable to redownload it  of course there are dangers to both sides, but for the most part any problem that happens digitally might cause you to have to re-download the game but if the physical copy is hurt or lost, game over."

Check out PSP games and PSOne Classics in terms of portable shooters, too!  Avoid Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified and Resistance: Burning Skies. Awful games.  Borderlands 2 is a rather poor port of a great game, but there's cross-save if you enjoy the game on PS3/PS4, and it's a nice compliment to the console counterpart.

vita,3daepj,easterreddit,2,Tue Jul 14 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"Because it's portable. That's the point of a handheld. When I'm bored on a long trip, having access to Borderlands is great.  Also, other good Vita games to check out are:  Gravity Rush  Uncharted Golden Abyss  DJMax Technika TUNE  Little Big Planet Vita  Hyperdimension Neptunia re; birth 1/2/3 (not ports. Remakes which are much better)  Freedom Wars  Soul Sacrifice"
vita,3daepj,Martin15Sleith,2,Tue Jul 14 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"Vita has a lot of games that aren't half ass ports, you just need to keep looking around more if that how you currently feel."
vita,3dad20,TheSuburbanHero,3,Tue Jul 14 19:06:22 2015 UTC,As far as I know all physical releases get a digital release on PSN.
vita,3dad20,pancakesandhyrup,3,Tue Jul 14 19:16:41 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain Sony requires that all Vita and PS4 physical releases also get digital releases on PSN.

vita,3d859f,Kinsey93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:34:52 2015 UTC,"I would say to keep playing over and over again and you'll definitely get better, also bombs don't give any points only geoms, so onlyy use bombs when you're in a pinch and about to die. All of the enemies have unique patterns and if you learn them it becomes much easier to  survive."

vita,3d7uo1,razisgosu,2,Tue Jul 14 05:49:14 2015 UTC,Definitely. Its just a matter of when. NISA doesn't exactly have a bunch of the IPs they had to localize anymore thanks to Gust becoming part of TK. They also said they were pleased with Criminal Girls localized sales on their forums.
vita,3d7uo1,Martin15Sleith,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:07 2015 UTC,Good! They just had a brand new sale from me yesterday lol
vita,3d7uo1,Teath123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:02 2015 UTC,Depends. NA might localize this if they found the sales of the first game good.Though the chances of them localizing it is fairly high.
vita,3d7uo1,gene_parmesan258,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will. NISA generally localize everything when they've decided to start on a series."
vita,3d7uo1,razisgosu,0,Tue Jul 14 12:18:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt it actually.  I don't think the original sold very well.  With that said, it seems the skimped on localization costs compared to what they usually do, so maybe it was a cheaper job and they didn't need to sell as much.  And as such, they might do the same with the sequel."
vita,3d7uo1,gene_parmesan258,3,Tue Jul 14 08:29:38 2015 UTC,"The original sold well enough for NISA to be pleased with. A NISA employee quote to follow ""Sorry to burst your confirmation bias bubble, but we're actually very happy with Criminal Girls' sales performance. If our decision to censor certain elements of Criminal Girls incensed the majority of our fanbase to such a degree that it had a negative impact on the game's sales, we're not seeing it.""  http://nisamerica.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=103&t=15014&start=1290"

vita,3d83d8,deathbladeishere,2,Tue Jul 14 06:33:18 2015 UTC,so it's a no for ad-hoc play huh ... okay thanks mate!
vita,3d83d8,SoggyDonuts,4,Tue Jul 14 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"It's a yes for adhoc, but a no for online. If two go online then it kicks the first off as soon as the other goes online after asking you to sign in.   Games can actually be on 3 at a time so you can adhoc between three vitas/pstvs at the same time on the same account if you wanted."

vita,3d7xrl,Grekon,2,Tue Jul 14 05:24:40 2015 UTC,pull out the memory card and see if it still does it if that fixes it its a problem with the card...could also just be a temp problem resolved by removing the card and then putting it back in
vita,3d7xrl,deathbladeishere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:46:17 2015 UTC,I agree. Best thing you can do is remove the card first.  Can you open the restore menu BTW?
vita,3d5gvc,Rotato_chips,8,Mon Jul 13 17:57:25 2015 UTC,"It is not as unplayable as some people make it out to be, it has gotten much better. With that said, the game does still crash and the framerate is less than ideal. Sometimes I can go for long stretches of time without any crashes and then sometimes it will crash a few times in a row. When it comes to the framerate I only want it to be at a steady 30fps, but it rarely matches that; it can get pretty choppy in combat, but not as bad as before the latest patch.   TL;DR If you are someone that can look past the technical problems, then I suggest picking it up."
vita,3d5gvc,SwiftCase,5,Mon Jul 13 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 2 on the Vita looks and plays decent, but it's not as well supported as the PC, PS3/4 and Xbox 360/One versions (eg no hot-fixes, can only do two-player co-op, not all skins are available, etc.). The only reason to play it on Vita is for portability, or if you don't have a PC, Xbox 360/One, or PS3/4.   The game is definitely not perfect on the Vita, but it is playable."
vita,3d5gvc,ps_vita,3,Mon Jul 13 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you're affected by framerate stutters, as someone who played perfect dark on the n64 and had a crappy pc back in the 90's i can honestly say it's not that bad. If you absolutely need games to perform silky smooth you may have a bad time though."
vita,3d5gvc,Oliibald,3,Mon Jul 13 20:51:38 2015 UTC,to be honest it's a vita and it's a full console game I don't think you sold expect it to run smoothly at 30 fps anyways it does have frame rate drops when a lot of enemies are on screen. textures are okay nothing special but not horrible. honestly if you enjoyed it on 360 or pc or whatever you might have played it on you'll love it if you've never played it before and it's your first time you might not appreciate the port and might think of it negatively rather then a huge console game on the go. give it a shot if your interested gameplay for me is acceptable and decent the story and great first person shooter action makes up for the frame rate. pick it up.
vita,3d5gvc,zeroalexzero,3,Mon Jul 13 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"No.   It's not perfect, it has frame rate drops, you might even get a crash, but it's def playable, and still fun."
vita,3d5gvc,Brother_Clovis,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"As I tell everyone who asked, you even more so as you havent played any of them.  The vita version of borderlands 2 is fantastic. Not unplayable at all, quite the opposite. Sure there is occasional hiccups, but it is my favorite and most played version of the game, I literally STOPPED playing my 360 version because of the vita version.  a nutshell, its awesome"
vita,3d5gvc,NeoJ4K3,0,Tue Jul 14 04:46:17 2015 UTC,I stopped playing the ps3 PS+ one when I got it for vita
vita,3d5gvc,Neo_Techni,5,Sat Jul 18 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"The framerate drops for the most part aren't that frequent. In general, the framerate is definitely playable and isn't a deal-breaker, at least in my opinion. The worst you'll see is probably in Sanctuary, but everywhere else isn't that bad.  It's the stutters that are the most annoying part of it, taking your aim far away from where you intended to shoot when they happen, which can get rather frustrating in hectic battles. Stutters aren't too frequent, but you will encounter them a few times in an area most likely. If you couple this with the fact that Borderlands doesn't use hitscanning for weapons (i.e. Your bullets take time to reach your enemy), then you might have a bad time with shooting. It's still playable though, just mildly frustrating at times.  The visuals are OK. Textures are relatively low-res, but the cel-shaded nature of Borderlands makes it less messy-looking with its charm. You can see enemies fairly easily so long as you aren't in a dark area, but their bullets aren't easy to see at all unfortunately. The gun models, considering the magnitude of them available, are actually quite good and are easily distinguishable, and the enemies' models aren't too bad either (although they don't ragdoll upon dying, rather just explode into a pile of blood). So long as you are in a well-lit room, you shouldn't have too much trouble with how things look.  And the controls work fine in my opinion. The analogs are more-or-less like the console ones, the L and R ""aim and shoot"" mechanic works well, and switching weapons with the D-Pad is easy enough. But, if you despise the rear touchpad then you might not be so happy; it's used to melee and sprint by default (you can customise basically every input though besides the D-Pad, so you could map them elsewhere). If you can avoid touching it by accident then you should be fine, but it is definitely less desirable than clicking in analog sticks.  I would definitely overall say that it is playable -- quite fun actually when you get into it -- and it is not a skimped version at all in terms of base-game content; it is Borderlands 2 on-the-go which for some is like a dream come true. Compared to every other version of the game however, it is definitely the least favourable version of the game in terms of technical performance and support. But if you love Borderlands and would love to play it on the bus or while waiting for something, then I'd say go ahead."
vita,3d5gvc,LMW-YBC,0,Mon Jul 13 19:49:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help :) think I'm gonna get it since it's 20$ on Amazon right now
vita,3d5gvc,KingStoph,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:21 2015 UTC,"Love it, would be made better is having the grip that adds R2 and L2"
vita,3d5gvc,Xephon7,4,Tue Jul 14 11:19:57 2015 UTC,"It's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. I've had a few drops here and there, but not once did it get to an unplayable level. If you're interested in getting it on your Vita for the portability, I'd say go for it. It's definitely graphically the weakest of the versions (but by no means bad in the visual department. Game still looks good), but it has all the fun of the other versions. Plus, if you buy it new, you get most of the DLC (some DLC was released after the Vita version launched. At the time of launch, it was all the DLC.)"
vita,3d5gvc,Stuifiee,2,Mon Jul 13 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"How often does it crash? I can deal with low framerates, crashing not so much."
vita,3d5gvc,SlantedPictureFrame,5,Mon Jul 13 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"I've put in around 10-15 hours into the game so far, and it hasn't crashed once. There are low framerates everywhere, but the game is more than playable."
vita,3d5gvc,Xephon7,3,Mon Jul 13 18:12:26 2015 UTC,I've put in between 35-40 hours into the Vita version and haven't had a single crash. So I'd say you'll be fine.
vita,3d5gvc,Beetey,2,Mon Jul 13 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"How recently did you play it? I remember buying it at launch and by the time I had put 40 hours in it I'm sure I had already experienced 60+ crashes. I haven't played it any since it lasted updated, so the crashing problem may have been eliminated (or at least reduced) since then."
vita,3d5gvc,Xephon7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:56 2015 UTC,From about a week or so after launch. Have yet to have any significant issues with it.  Last time I played was around 5 days or so ago.
vita,3d5gvc,Beetey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"Strange. When I played at launch the crashes were just infuriatingly frequent. Don't get me wrong, I still had a blast with it; I just hated losing my progress all the time. From what I have seen, it seems to have been split around 50/50 regarding whether or not people had crashing issues. Regardless, I'm definitely gonna pick it up again sometimes soon. I'm really curious to see how much it has improved."
vita,3d5gvc,Xephon7,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Did you get it on the Slim model? Digital or physical? Not sure. Plenty of variables.  For me, I had physical copy on my launch day Vita. Only had minor frame hiccups.  Regardless, as you said, and we can agree on, its still a blast in the end."
vita,3d5gvc,Beetey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"I bought a physical copy as well, and I played it on the Fat model. I also did a lot of multiplayer which, if I recall correctly, was when a significant portion of the crashes I experienced took place."

I was completely disappointed by the lack of performance / stuttering / controls.  More to the point, it didn't include the best DLC (Tiny Tina!)  So... maybe if you only play on the Vita, you won't notice it's a smoking pile of pee poops compared to the PS3."

vita,3d5gvc,deathbladeishere,3,Mon Jul 13 18:40:57 2015 UTC,I'm not one to demand 60 fps myself. But this port seems to run around 15 fps in combat.
