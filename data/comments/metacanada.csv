If you wanted to see the same thing that happened to Greece, invoke Minicome to the entire country. It is essentially the same thing that happened in Greece.  Some years back, Greece came up with a very intriguing idea -- one that even I might have agreed with. For those people who work in risky jobs, they could take early retirement. So for instance, you work in a bomb disposal team. Risky job. So you could retire at 55 and the government would help cover your retirement pension. On the surface it sounds like a good idea.  But there was two big problems with it. First, you were given almost 80% of your wages which is nowhere near what any other country has for pensions. Second was that over time jobs that really weren't high risk made it onto the list. Before long you could be a hairdresser and retire with the government paying most of your wages because (gasp!) those hairspray chemicals could be hazardous. And so on it went.  Eventually almost everyone over 55 was retired. That was putting a huge strain on the government's cash. Somebody has to pay for all of these retired pensions. You're a left leaning government much like the NDP. What do you do? Cancel the program? Hell no. All those people who are now retired are dependent on your government to keep the money flowing. That equates to big time votes and you staying in power indefinitely.  So you know what happened. They went after their favorite boogyman. Make the corporations pay for it all because they have all the money. As expected, the corporations packed their bags and left, taking lots and lots of work with them.  Now you suddenly have three big problems. Everyone over 55 is retired and being paid by the government. The corporations that you thought would pay for all of it are gone. And now you have a massive unemployment problem with young people. Somebody else might have shifted rails at that point and steered the train away from that cliff, but not Greece. They just kept on going like everything was all good until they rode right off that cliff.  Ontario is nothing like what is happening in Greece.  But Canada could easily become the next Greece if this batshit crazies in /r/canada got their way and brought minicome into law."

We still have Toyota and a number of other huge name brands producing here, providing direct and indirect jobs. Most imports coming into Canada come to Ontario first, providing logicistics/transportation jobs.  Ontario is actually well off, it's just the bloat created by the public service unions that keep our debt up. We need to abolish certain unions, most notably the teachers union and their ridiculous third party contracts. Seriously, a school has to pay upwards of a hundred bucks to have someone come in to screw a pencil sharpener into a table because of those union fuckers. An individual teacher can't do it themselves for free because of those damn contacts. This is where we're losing all our money.  In short we're fine. We have industry to rely on and not just tourism like Greece. Ottawa will not allow Ontario to fail, Conservative, Liberal or even NDP. We give too much to the country, way more than Greece provides to the EU. We just have to abolish the Teachers Union and OPSU and build those services up from the ground floor again. If they didn't have those outrageous third party contracts it would be cheaper to run provincial services and we could even afford to pay the rank and file employees more money.   Abolish union contracts and give them to new upstarts and trusted companies that won't gouge the ever living hell out of the public coin purse. Seriously, some of those contractors would make Bell and Rogers blush."

He blames Harper for the baby having said candy in the first place (something about a family benefit Trudeau will see to ending).  Trudeau went on to say that it is not his fault if an interview question is asked in a way that answers shouldn't be as hazy as a good day in Beijing - a place he has warm admiration for.  Mulcair picks up the slack and blames Harper for that too by the way.  Something about a Clarity Law that has to go if politicians are to get on with rebuilding the ROC during his tenure.

I'm saying people pretend they get benned for their politics, when really it's their approach. I mean, TN's entire point is to be a dick to people, not engage in productive conversation. I think he would be the first to admit that. So pretending like it's his 'right wing' ideas and not the way he delivers them is sort of feeding le olde victim complex. Now, I don't know the whole story here, this is clearly a snippet of a larger conversation. But plenty of people express conservative ideas without being TexasNorth level troll.

Sort of like when we shit post to one another after awhile when I get tired / bored of it I just stop posting.  If Texas goes and says people in Alberta are dumb fucks because so and so libtard then people should just downvote it and move on or go ahead and start to shit post back.  But don't report it and cry about how it makes you uncomfortable.  I guess if he replies to people regularly and calls them libtards without any other info then ya, he deserves the ban.  tl;dr - if you post something of merit doesn't matter if your style makes other uncomfortable.

You do not need to employed by a business to have the authority to remove some one.  A mod is an appointted representative given the authority to monitor the subreddit...they have been given the authority to manage the subreddit as needed.    If you want to think of Reddit similar to a Local Community Poster Board...that board is owned by some one else...it is by their grace you are allowed to post on it.  Reddit is owned by some one else who is not u/TexasNorth, he has no right to post whatever he feels like on this site.  He wants that freedom...he needs to own his own website to do so.

If some one keeps abusing the subreddit and its readers/mods...like u/TexasNorth has...they will be banned, again and again.  It's that simple.  Even if they can not stop him completely...they can prevent him from getting his message out very far if they want...at least in their own subreddit.  If some one was posting content to a sub that it did not belong into, or incredibly offensive material...that user could expect to be banned and posts deleted.  This is no different.

metacanada,3dzr59,Pocahontas_Spaceman,5,Tue Jul 21 01:00:49 2015 UTC,Why do cunts make you uncomfortable though?  I don't go apeshit when someone calls me something rude on reddit.  Just take a deep breathe and move along.
metacanada,3dzr59,MidnightTide,7,Tue Jul 21 01:34:28 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point. His comments are rarely directed at me though. It's just annoying to see his bitching in so many threads instead of useful discussion.  Yes, we can downvote him and ignore him, but it's easier if he just can't post at all."
metacanada,3dzr59,cwmshy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"He's pretty far to the right, much more so than Conservatives. From my perspective, his ""bitching"" is a function of the environment being so radically different from him. Since he has very different views, everyone else's views will seem very wrong and dumb.   As for the frustration in his tone: Imagine you lived in a world where the majority had opinions very similar to him, and the government functioned similar to how he wants. Do you think he will still be brash in that environment? I doubt it. Especially when comparing his behaviour in this subreddit. But how would you feel? Can you not see yourself eventually becoming angry, and lashing out?   The tricky thing about censoring rudeness is that it is easier to be polite when your perspective is the majority, but significantly harder as a tiny minority. So the tiny minority will either stay but be rude, or leave the community on their own accord to avoid being rude."
metacanada,3dzr59,Dan4t,4,Tue Jul 21 05:21:21 2015 UTC,"You're trying to understand his views, and I appreciate that.  Having said that, if there's one thing I've realized by expressing my views, reddit users are all over the spectrum from moderate left to very extreme conservative right. Many users share many views with TexasNorth, but only this user stands out with his rudeness and unrelated statements that seek only to offend."
metacanada,3dzr59,cwmshy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"Many users share many views with TexasNorth, but only this user stands out with his rudeness and unrelated statements that seek only to offend.   Do they express their views as frequently? From my observations they don't. Usually when I see polite opposition, it's from a perspective that isn't far from the hivemind. Although if you spend a lot of time in the hivemind, those opposing views may seem more extreme than they actually are.   The more time spent in an environment like that, and the more you talk and get exposed to unchecked rudeness from the hivemind, the harder it gets to remain polite. The only realistic way to open up a sub to opposing views is to tolerate rudeness, because only the rude folks will be willing to express their views often enough. That rude person will attract others who share that view, which can slowly reduce the conditions that produce hostility. However, when someone like TexasNorth gets banned, part of the silent minority will eventually leave too.   For example, in /r/Canada my views are considered extreme relative to the hivemind there. When I go into that sub, I get frustrated. As a result, I often choose to refrain from commenting because I don't like being rude. On occasion I will comment and be polite. But I can only maintain the politeness by taking a lot of breaks."
metacanada,3dzr59,Dan4t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:40 2015 UTC,"I don't mind being rude, and somehow succeed with it a lot of the time. However, I try to ensure that most of my message is still expressing views on an issue instead of just insulting others. TexasNorth seems to have very rude posts with little substance."
metacanada,3dzr59,cwmshy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"TexasNorth seems to have very rude posts with little substance.   He doesn't always explain things very well, I'll give you that. But there usually is substance behind his statements. The substance will appear oversimplified or irrelevant if you don't have the same background knowledge. Hence, why benefit of the doubt is so important in situations like this."

metacanada,3dw0s8,Political_Junky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"This is partially true, you're correct.  If the government were to return tax money collected from everyone TO everyone, that would be great, but they're not doing that.  They're collecting tax money from everyone and returning it to a select group that government has deemed 'deserving.'  This is no different than government taxing black people so that they could give white people a rebate, which I would also be against, FYI.  This is pandering politics.

metacanada,3dw0s8,TexasNorth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:35 2015 UTC,It is most definitely pandering politics.

All I'm saying is while we should criticize the CPC when they do things that aren't fiscally conservative we also need to be careful we don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.    fuck social conservatives in general.

Not saying that's good or bad, it's just the nature of supply-and-demand. A government-funded childcare system would be more likely to provide more service to rural areas. If you relied on the market, services and infrastructure would be less available and more expensive in rural areas. Wireline phones, electricity, roads, broadband, hospitals, and schools are are more subsidized in the country than the city. Rural voters, who are overwhelmingly conservative, are the more reliant on government than urban people, by far."

metacanada,3dna43,CPWX,3,Sat Jul 18 01:52:02 2015 UTC,That was a well written article. I have a lot of respect of how the Toronto Star editorial board handled this story.
metacanada,3dna43,AkivaAvraham,4,Sat Jul 18 02:03:07 2015 UTC,"I sort of feel they should have shown her the door for that stunt. The videotape evidence that was there tells a very different story than the narrative she provided. It looks like to an outsider like myself that she was looking to make a smear article which completely blew up in her face.  It puts some very nasty egg on the face of the paper's image. I will respect their decision to keep her on, though it does weaken credibility of future articles she may publish. It also slightly tarnishes my trust in the reporting of the paper.  There is one thing I have observed about the media and that is they fully underestimate Ezra. They consider him some right wing idiot nutjob and that's far from the truth. He does his best to ensure his facts and sources are correct and that there's very little that someone can do to come back at him. So far there's only been one successful libel suit that I know of and there's some very questionable rulings by the judge in that case.   I don't like always what he has to say or how he goes about saying it, but I would trust his reporting over many other reporters any day. He's the reporter that Canada deserves, but not right now. So they'll mock him and fight him. Because he can take it. Because he's not left leaning. He's a vocal blowtorch, a seeker of truth. A real reporter."

These jobs have union pay grids and there is no negotiating in terms of compensation.    And higher compensation & benefits relative to each hour put in compared to the private sector. Something like 70% of the public service in Sweden is made up of women, a little less in the nordic/high tax countries, and 55% in Canada. Of course this isn't sexist at all./s  But honestly, it's kind of an underhanded, possibly dishonest way of maximizing your ability to accomplish your life goals. Constantly shoot for public sector employment, because sexism, utilize the unions to provide stable increasing pay and/or generous benefits for an average work week of 35 hours and boom! You've got the most realistic, yet generous situation that allows for you to maintain raising your children or life balance by maximizing your gain regardless of productivity and limiting your responsibility to be so.

I've seen better and more passionate political discussion here from the right and the left.

Instead we have a bunch of neckbeard mods who don't give a shit about some whiny bitch reporting everything because they are getting rekt in a debate.

Abdulazeez was not under investigation by the FBI before the shooting, the New York Times reported, citing a source in the agency. But, the newspaper reported, a law enforcement official said that his father had been investigated years ago for contributing money to an organization that may have had ties to terrorists.  (and his sister had to move out of the country to marry the person she wanted to, their parents felt they were the ones who would chose)  The problem with this wonderful melting pot of multiculturalism is that many immigrants come over with zero intent of assimilating.

Fact is we have no idea about this girls condition.

This doesn't sound at all like the epilepsy we should all be familiar with. And slagging her or her family when we have no idea what's up sounds pretty low.

My main beef with this is the masses of people who want, ever so desperately, for the government to be more and more involved in everyone's life but can't understand why they totally fuck it up in cases like this. All these neckbeards want free university education, free healthcare, free housing, mincome and promote giving the government unlimited power if it means they can tax the shit out of everyone to pay for it so they don't have to.

Their sense of entitlement is literally that extreme.   /r/news had several gems like this in the Jeb Bush post:   ""Why is it considered noble to work alot? I consider that shitty and terrible."" . "" Shifting to a 30 hour work week and guaranteed minimum income with healthcare will fix most of this,but that won't happen till people start burning shit down.""

""It really riles me up when people say ""if I'm not working, I just don't know what to do with myself. How much TV can you watch?"" Like, bruh. If I didn't have to work my days would still be completely jam-packed.

metacanada,3ddybw,bkswan,2,Thu Jul 16 11:03:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone wants things in their interest which is why people that work hard and earn a decent living want to keep it and want the government to be minimally intrusive.   Right, wanting lower taxes, for you, makes sense. However, businesses and high income earners are a minority group that doesn't have much voting power. So it is intuitively in the interest of the majority to continuously demand that they pay more taxes so that the majority can get more free stuff. This already happens, but I'm curious why it isn't worse than it already is.    The annoying part is when the neckbeards advocate for a bunch of leftist wealth redistributive bullshit but disguise it as being motivated by a greater good. Like that they want to just help everyone but they are really just looking for personal handouts from big scary businesses and the awful rich people.   Yea, after spending a bunch of time exploring the /r/basicincome subreddit, it become clear to me that the whole mincome thing is intended to be a stepping stone towards communism. Communism is openly glorified in that sub, and there are many highly upvoted comments that explicitly say that this is the goal. The only opposition to those comments is people saying that that goal should be kept quiet. It had originally confused me as to why they push for mincome rather than a negative income tax which has more support from economists. Pushing for mincome instead of a negative income tax makes more sense if there is a bigger goal to establish communism.   They are also widely inconsistent on their stances on pretty much everything. They advocate government intrusion constantly in regulations but don't want the government to monitor terrorist activity on the web because that's intrusive.   I don't think that's inconsistent. They just want the government to intrude on other people, rather than them. They want to have the option of organizing a violent resistance group. Communists have shown over and over through history that they see violence as a legitimate means of protest. With the exception of Marx, if you spend your time reading books by communist leaders such as Fidel Castro, you're going to see a ton of advice on how to violently overthrow a government, as well as justifications for terrorism. A good chunk of popular communist literature is basically terrorist propaganda."

Soldiers, on our streets. More soliders, on our streets! Totally factual and unbiased narrative from a source that stands nothing to gain from framing the opposition as evil."

metacanada,3dc1se,Pocahontas_Spaceman,10,Wed Jul 15 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"Edit: I think there's probably a difference between an ""attack ad"" and a ""critical ad"" - and while that line is pretty thin, I think this ad seems to be much more in the ""critical"" department.    Okay, where is the line, /u/surtur1313?  crit·i·cize ˈkridəˌsīz/ verb verb: criticize;   1. indicate the faults of (someone or something) in a disapproving way.     ""states criticized the failure to provide an adequate and permanent compensation""     synonyms:   find fault with, censure, denounce, condemn, attack, lambaste, pillory, rail against, inveigh against, arraign, cast aspersions on, pour scorn on, disparage, denigrate, give bad press to, run down; More"

Anything you post in public is subject to others making fun of the things you say in public. This is not harassment. No matter how hard you want it to be. People disagreeing with you and making fun of your public posts is free speech and you are as viable a target as ANYBODY. It's no different then making fun of a politicians twitter feed. Again nobody is doxxing you and nobody is threatening you. Now grow a sense of humour or leave the interneting to the big kids."

It would be pretty stupid to invoke someones name in a thread and ban them when they come to defend themselves. But in general, you come here because everyone thinks the same."

Just because a bunch of rejects got together and share a love of the great leader doesn't make the place you got kicked out of from a space space or an anti harper circle jerk.
metacanada,3d81x0,Dan4t,3,Tue Jul 14 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"Well not all of us have been banned. I and a few others here comment over there on occasion. However, the conservations in that subreddit rarely have enough substance for decent debate. In addition, we usually get downvoted to the point of our comments becoming hidden. The downvotes also creates a delay time for responding, which often leads to just leaving the conversation since waiting around to comment is rather annoying. This is usually corrected with upvotes later on. But by then we're likely to have moved on to something else. At least that is how it is for me.    doesn't make the place you got kicked out of from a space space or an anti harper circle jerk.   If you honestly think that /r/CanadaPolitics isn't an anti-Harper circlejerk, then by those standards, /r/metacanada isn't a Conservative circlejerk."

Either way, the fact that even the NDP is embracing trade deals and refusing to raise taxes says one thing:  The left has failed and no longer exists in Canada.  The Canadian left is now dead.

Secondly, the fact that Trudeau supports most legislation regarding national security makes him orders of magnitude better than Mulcair. Trudeau's support for new pipelines also puts him well above Mulcair. Mulcair is also a bigger problem because he might actually implement his crazier ideas.

The CPC is also in a position where having innovative proposed policies to motivate voters wouldn't make much sense. If they had another good idea, why haven't they already passed the bill for it?   Their strategy has to be to appeal to their reliability and stability, not to radical new ideas.

Without knowing those things it's hard to tell what is shit to you.   If I were to write the CPC platform based entirely on policy I consider ideal, the CPC wouldn't stand a chance of getting elected. So I consider some bad, yet popular, policy to be necessary for the sake of getting elected. That then allows some of the better stuff to have a chance of being implemented. Harper does a good job of balancing both right wing and left wing ideals. He aims for the right while also trying to respect popular left wing policy. It's really a shame how the media has treated him considering how often he compromises with the left.

Woodside is also serving as the President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. First elected as a city councillor for Fredericton City Council in 1981, he also served as deputy mayor. In 1986, Woodside was elected Mayor of Fredericton and is now serving his eighth term, which makes him the longest serving mayor of Fredericton.   In 1999, Woodside resigned as mayor to run for MP of the Fredericton North riding (No. 43) for the Liberal party.  He lost to Peter Forbes of the Progressive Conservatives.  Woodside ran for mayor again in 2004 and won.   As Mayor, Woodside can count a range of accomplishments, including promoting information technology in Fredericton, and the development of information technology infrastructure such as the Fred eZone wireless zone. During his tenure as mayor, music festivals have been promoted in Fredericton including the Harvest and Blues Jazz Festival, the Country Music Festival, and FredRock. While infill development and sustainability have been priorities of his tenure as mayor, he has also faced controversy over sprawling box-store development in the university woods, a previously protected wooded area.

EDIT: Just did a quick google to see if I could find some numbers. The Ludlow Massacre ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre ) in Colorado was one of the deadliest incidents of anti-union violence in US history. Between 69-199 people were killed over about a year and a half. The single deadliest incident involved two dozen deaths.

I want the freedom to work 12 hour days if I want to without the business being forced to pay more. Safety standards I'm on the fence about.

Some of them were born on the fucking boat that was adrift in the middle of the sea, lost. They had to drink their own piss to stay alive. But all you had to do was jump a border. Lucky you!  Currently the country is still fucked up and corrupt, because of the culture of bribery and corruption that has seeped in the the other part. That's how things got done when you have a centrally planned economy, i.e. communism. It does not work, and has never worked.    It was corrupt individuals who gained power.   That is exactly what people have to do to maintain communism. You don't really get it... To fully enforce proper communism/socialism, you need to grant yourself the adequate authority keep everyone in line proportional to how much you want authentic communism. The central planners have to become the thing they don't want to be the most for the idea to be effective.   I'll post some points from a very famous type of government and let you guess which government it was, and which method it used to accomplish it's goals:   We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the country.  All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.  The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.  That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.  We demand the nationalization of all trusts.  We demand profit-sharing in large industries.  We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.  We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.  We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.   Wow, sounds like a typical /r/Canadian!"

metacanada,3cyodu,Karthan,6,Sun Jul 12 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"I think you should vote for the Liberals for three core reasons:  (1) A team you can believe in: If you look at the people running for the different parties I firmly believe that the Liberals have the highest quality people -- ranging from the first Sikh brigade commander in Canadian history, generals, foreign diplomats, economists, MLAs making the jump federally, and more. This is in contrast to the NDP electing massive amounts of students and, some may claim, less qualified folks in the recent Alberta provincial election and the Quebec wave in 2011. Additionally, with resignations and people leaving the Harper cabinet, Harper's pool of possible cabinet members is at its lowest it has ever been. There's a substantial group of people that Trudeau has pulled in as candidates to serve their country that are varied, excellent, and would do this nation good. You can see a listing of these candidates online at www.teamtrudeau.ca  (2) A crime agenda that isn't weird or nutty. Liberals have committed to eliminating mandatory minimums, wouldn't create laws for the purpose of having them struck down by the courts, and would reform our penal system to work on the mental health aspects of crime. The goal of the justice system has never been to be vicious: rather, to seek justice, reform individuals, and create peace and order. This requires a less simplistic ""jail them all"" perspective that seems to be more often than not the Conservative perspective. Also, as you've noted, legalize pot.  (3) You'd have a person like me helping out in Ottawa. That'd be pretty great, wouldn't it?  EDIT: Also, some of the ideas at www.realchange.ca might strike your fancy. Give it a quick once over."
metacanada,3cyodu,davesfriendchip,3,Sun Jul 12 19:03:21 2015 UTC,Okay I can buy all of #1 but you lost me on #2. Not sure how deep a dive into this issue but it honestly puzzles me why Liberals are so against locking people up. Innocent people are harmed by criminals that are released based on the false pretense that we can rehabilitate people.  best of luck on winding up in Ottawa btw.
metacanada,3cyodu,Karthan,3,Sun Jul 12 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"Innocent people are harmed by criminals that are released based on the false pretense that we can rehabilitate people.

metacanada,3cyodu,Dhghomon,2,Sun Jul 12 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"If you look at the people running for the different parties I firmly believe that the Liberals have the highest quality people    I'm going to vote either Conservative or Liberal this time around, and this is one of the main reasons why the Liberals are tempting. Even after all this time they still tend to get highly qualified and not all that nutty candidates.  I think Trudeau will eventually become PM (the Liberals are so low now that they have nowhere to go but up, and the CPC still doesn't have a good successor to Harper), but hopefully it will happen two elections down the road. Around 90 seats for them this election is what I'd like to see."

Well as I recall, /u/irwin08 did a pretty good job getting the elections set up, and we had like a hundred people running and a lot of excitement to create a model House of Commons. However there was some narcissistic left wing nutjob who was complaining at length that the straw poll set up to do the elections was not fullproof enough, and complaining that we weren't doing it through Porportional Representation, while simultaneously running sock puppets for his party. He ended up causing a needless stink about the whole thing, and the election was cancelled, and sure enough everyone lost interest.   In trying to recover the excitement prior, there were some other NDP party mods who decided that the process was not bureaucratic enough. I basically at that point decided that this would only really appeal to people who advocate the insanity that is bureaucracy... and I think my suspicions were pretty much vindicated"

metacanada,3cxuqm,Dan4t,3,Sun Jul 12 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much.   I'm guilty as anyone for criticizing mods when they make mistakes, but in the end I don't hold grudges as long as they don't have a long-term plan to exert their personal bias onto the subreddit (which I feel was the case during the great war, even though I'm ok with DR666 these days). Given the amount of modding they do (most of which we don't see, including dealing with modmail), and the difficulty of finding someone that cares enough to go through the hassle of modding but isn't emotional about the topics being discussed, I think they do a good job overall in the Canadian subs.   There is an overall left-leaning bias to the moderation in CanadaPolitics, but there's also a left-leaning bias to the userbase, and to the content being discussed, and I'm sure it's hard to find a CPC supporter who wants to sift through all the anti-right crap all day and put up with endless complaints about post removals."

The bias just doesn't get to me anymore - it is what it is. I've had left-wingers say that I shouldn't be a mod for CP because I've commented on the bias, to which I respond: ""prove me wrong"".

I take it that you don't see the rules them selves as playing a part in that subreddits bias? I mean, if opinion pieces are encouraged, and most opinion pieces available are leftist, then it seems you're going to end up with a leftist subreddit.

This is impossible because most people on Reddit are only interested in economics that specifically benefit them, either directly or indirectly, so long as they don't have to pay for it.Take Bernie Sanders for instance... He's popular because he promises all the ""free shit"" and plans to pay for it with overused sound bites that are a more polite form of ""fuck the rich!"" Nobody tries to even hide it anymore, some people even think we should kill certain groups of people or throw them in jail because they are doing much better economically. My favourite thing about the Reddit hive mind is that poor people are totally not to blame for their own situation, but rich people ARE in 100% control of theirs... A giant, hypocritical victim complex if there ever was one.  This wouldn't be a problem if the majority of people didn't think that way, but they do. If 51% of the people decide to use the government to benefit themselves unfairly, even if it's directly at the expense of groups ""we don't like"" and indirectly everyone else, well fuck you, THATS DEMOCRACY."

I mean, s/he uses a poor metaphor, but that kinda is what governments do in these situations. You can't just do like a company would and fire half your workforce/dramatically cut costs, because the medical system/education/firefighters etc defintiely still need to work. Not to mention how shitty that looks- New gov't comes in, makes dramatic austerity measures, cutting services, yet has to keep taxes at the same rate to fix the hole the last government put Alberta into. Much better just to borrow and use that money to keep you afloat while you work on cleaning up the crap left behind. My economic understanding isn't great, but please where is the major flaw in this? It just seems you are opposed to governments having/using money in any way rather than actually having a reason to disagree."
metacanada,3cqozl,aidanhoff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:09:00 2015 UTC,"Please research 'Keynesian' economics (the failed theory that you can deficit spend your way out of an economic downturn.)  I say 'failed' because the way that liberals talk about Kenesian policies is not the correct way in which they were developed.    Modern liberals, particularly progressive-liberals, have this belief that we can just borrow and spend as much money as humanly possible, and that if we do, the economy will magically boom and everyone will have a job.  This, of course, is untrue, as evidenced by what happened during 'the great depression', and what Canada and the US have done the last several years since the '08 downturn."
metacanada,3cqozl,aidanhoff,4,Fri Jul 10 03:11:45 2015 UTC,They also never apply the other half of Keynesian theory. You know the part where you're actually supposed to reduce government spending during good times? Either we're in recession and it's time to spend or we're in an expansion and it's also time to spend.
metacanada,3cqozl,aidanhoff,2,Fri Jul 10 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"Researched it. From what I can tell, '08 and recent years haven't even been a good example of Keynesian economics. The stimulus simply went to banks and investment firms for the most part, rather than into infrastructure as Keynes intended. When that was applied properly in the late 1930's, Keyne's theory was fairly successful.  As you say, the way liberals talk about this is incorrect. Keynes specifically requires moderation of spending during good economic times which really didn't happen. However, just because this a leftist government borrowing money during a recession doesn't mean it's the end of the world. We don't even know what they'll use it for yet. They might not even be planning a stimulus package (I hope not...), maybe just increasing investment into education/healthcare etc. In a large way, which won't necessarily be bad."

Complete laissez-faire is something we know doesn't work... Look at the US healthcare system for an excellent example. It's too easy for large companies to manipulate that system and gain too much influence.
metacanada,3cqozl,youngmeezy69,0,Fri Jul 10 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"Laissez-faire economics don't work?  Wow, that's weird, because the US used to be quite 'free market' and they are the greatest economy in the world, and have been for a century - BECAUSE OF free markets principles.    I think the problem here is that you don't quite understand what Laissez-faire actually means, as evidenced by your example of US healthcare system.    US healthcare - much like the Canadian healthcare system - isn't failing because it's too free, or too 'free market' - it's fucking failing because it's not fucking free market enough.  It's fucking failing because the government regulates the shit out of it.  It's fucking failing because 'I know better than you' liberal idiots think that they can 'manage' the free market better than the free market can manage itself.  No offense, but you don't even have the slightest grasp of what a Laissez-faire, free market system is supposed to look like, but you sure have no problem criticizing it.    To point to something (like healthcare) that is HEAVILY regulated and say that it's failing because of free market principles is just.....retarded."

That means serving beef, particularly when the cow been raised on grain in a feedlot, requires more water and land than serving grain and bean-based options.

It's how you know you're dealing with an urban environmentalist who has never been anywhere near a farm.   Cows are not 'raised' on grain. They are finished on it, usually in the last few weeks of their life. The vast majority of cattle is raised primarily on pasture, it would be expensive as fuck to raise them on corn.  Hell, considering this is Alberta, locally raised beef is probably arguably more sustainable than grain and beans shipped in (with evil oil) from somewhere else."

How does this theory explain why Greece did so much worse than its neighbors? All this does is affect how soon the failure happens.    Plus, Greek's governmet is corrupt as fuck. That's not partisan, that's just plain ol corruption.    Corruption has a lot to do with right versus left wing politics, because one of the arguments against a larger government is that it leads to more corruption. It gets right down to the fundamental differences between people who lean left or right. One side trusts government more than markets, and the other markets more than government."
metacanada,3cbscq,Dan4t,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"How does this theory explain why Greece did so much worse than its neighbors?    Because their economy is much weaker, more fraught with internal corruption, and has historically been weaker because of these reasons. That's not really a result of 'bloated public sector funding', it's simply because of systemic corruption.    The fact other European countries like Germany have high levels of public sector funding/employment and yet arent imploding certainly shows the problem is not in the level of people feeding off a public trough, but the government that manages it. If your argument was true, German or France would be in the exact same place as Greece. The reality is, the issue is far more complex and embedded in decades if not hundreds of years of interconnected history. Greece is a historically corrupt government, that's not a 'left' issue or a 'right' issue. It's a corrupt incompetence issue.   Corruption has a lot to do with right versus left wing politics, because one of the arguments against a larger government is that it leads to more corruption   I suppose, but again, one can point to EU countries with similar levels of government that aren't imploding like Greece.   You can certainly distil the argument into a 'small gov v large gov' one, but there are examples of highly functioning economies like Germany that blow the comparison right out of the water. Plus, the argument immediately goes into no true conservative territory."

metacanada,3c9i90,Melondart,11,Mon Jul 6 06:34:12 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know. I'm from the US and I stumbled onto this sub about a year ago. I can't tell if it's a Canadian version of r/circlejerk or if I'm so out of the loop regarding Canadian culture that I can't recognize a legitimate political discussion board. I kinda get the feeling that this Harper fellow is the equivalent of Obama in the southern states.

metacanada,3c9i90,Adjustin_True_Dough,11,Mon Jul 6 09:02:37 2015 UTC,"Dude, Harper was born in Toronto, and that's way, way worse than Kenya, but he manages to be ok.   Secondly, when it comes, to The South, it shall rise again, just like it says in the Canadian anthem, regardless of what Obama does. Like it says, the North sent tens of thousands of men to die solely for the freedom of the Negro man, but all those fallen had a secret agenda of hatred."
metacanada,3c9i90,Dan4t,10,Mon Jul 6 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"Like how people blame Obama for literally everything? Yea, that's pretty accurate here with Harper. Doesn't really matter how well any Prime Minister or President does. The media will always try to convince people that they are terrible and going to ruin the country. Gets people nice and scared so that they keep reading the news.   Although I guess many outlets are being a bit nicer to Obama lately as the next election gets closer. Given the amount of power the Republicans have now, they can make them look like the big scary threat now."
metacanada,3c9i90,GuruMedit,5,Mon Jul 6 12:55:29 2015 UTC,Unless that government is Liberal. The media story changes substantially.  Send farmers to jail for trying to sell their grain outside of a government controlled organization? That's the farmer's fault for not trusting our great Chretien. Don't they know how great the CWB is?  Lowering taxes? HEIL HARPER IS EVIL AND TRYING TO KILL YOUR MEDICARE!!!
metacanada,3c9i90,Dan4t,5,Mon Jul 6 16:43:40 2015 UTC,It does get a little weird yea. But I still recall them attacking the Liberals. Although my memory of those are a bit fuzzy. I think many journalists are trying to rewrite history to make Chretien seem more loved than he actually was. Competition for the big media outlets is a bit different now too. Social media has become a bigger threat. So they need to work harder to scare people.

I find both Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto to be vacuous. I think communist ideas are terribly implemented, and completely flawed to begin with. There is no good to them whatsoever. My tone may be aggressive here with respect to Marx's work but it's not meant to be aggressive towards you.  The biggest flaw to me, is the straight coercion of a government authority to redistribute wealth and mandate equality. Good fucking luck. Milton Friedman said it best; “A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both.”  Carl Menger demonstrated the flaws in Marx's arguments as early as 1871 in his work the Principles of Economics when he demolished Marx's ideas about value by introducing marginalist theory.  On top of that Marx completely failed to account for the middle class. His expectation is that capitalism would eliminate the middle class and we would be stuck with two. That is actually the opposite of what happens in free markets, history has proven Marx wrong a number of times.  And finally his view on profits were totally off. His view was that profits were finite and as such capitalism would just run its course and there would be no profits left. Well that turned out to be horse shit too.  Still think it's good on paper?"

metacanada,3c18vg,1SHOUTINGWOMANSLIFE,4,Fri Jul 3 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"It was Markov-generated text.  Here is the source — now with Reptilian Overlords and improved pedigree.  This is the source: put it into a online Markov to get (more gibberingly) gibbish:  You think the BIKER GANGS and DRUG CARTELS are not CORPORATIONS NOW? If it happens at the right stage, it does not mean the ARGLBLARGL had to drink HEAVILY. Keep reading! It makes it WORK! The effort expended to add words is WONDERFUL! It makes it EVEN MORE effective! There is no way around it, Syborg. You are cooked. LOL! This huge cost of R&D? PROPAGANDA. The cost of MARKETING- the parties, the launch, the perks for docs IS EQUAL to the R&D and they never tell that part. NEVER. SYBAU - same tactics new name. You are willing to sink a country to get at little ole me? NOW that is one big obsession. You keep reading, sweetie. Reported 3rd time. WOW! You made me cry! My British REPTILIAN MASTER is also touched. WOW! Amazing forbearance boys! I am so glad you videotaped that cretin! END OF JULY before your REPTILIAN HATCHLINGS are ENSLAVED to corporations -NO END TO THE CONTRACT. NONE. END OF JULY before your REPTILIAN HATCHLINGS are ENSLAVED to corporations -NO END TO THE CONTRACT. NONE. Capitals are silent. ABSOLUTELY. Just listen. you impose yelling with your generational convention. This is coming from the BANK OF AMERICA who loves to pick up our money and fear chases money out of Canada. You should remember the statement by the Venusian Oil minister confirming that the USA would pick up the tab. After Nafta Chapter 11 and our being the most SUED COUNTRY in the world- for PROTECTING our citizens?, you still trust the MARTIANS? We hit .70 when Chretien was in office- caused by DILITHIUM. NOW the REPTILIANS own our BRAIN FLAYERS. DILITHIUM and BRAIN FLAYERS- direct aim at ALBERTA and our bread basket. Our loonie did not rise again until DILITHIUM DID. Consult with CORPORATIONS which already ignore CANADIAN LAW? Consult with a country that does not abide by treaties on TORTURING our citizens. They LIE about their own LAWS. GIVE and get? What are WE the country with the greatest wealth of RESOURCES on the planet getting besides slavery and membership in the CHEATER's club of the universe? It leaves out WHAT % of the world's population? OR even more profitably, find ways to make TAXpayers pay more and call it 'projected profits"" while producing NOTHING and citizens lose all their rights in favour of CORPORATIONS? Please, I worked for the company which owned TEXOPAC. IN the DIVISION and there were only a total of 5 of us and one boss in ALL OF CANADA. The money went straight to the USA- do not pass GO! Still the same old song? Did SNOWDEN make it all up? DID MANNING? No- but you will defend TORTURE TOO. So if they do not fight by ""Marquis of Queensbury Rules"" TRUTH does not MATTER? Funny, the Mohawks did not use those rules to defeat the last US invasion either. New form of warfare- SCUTTLE ECONOMIES. Designed to make Canadians run to the USA to be saved! Or CONSERVATIVE= REPUBLICAN for (cough) SAFETY! How much did our ALLIES push oil $ to fall? Wake up CANADA- they are not trying to help us! BANK OF AMERICA! Why is ANY TRADE deal not including the CITIZENS? RELEVANCE? None. Eli Lily just SUED CANADA for 'projected profits' for $500 million. If they are so BIG, as you point out WHY DO THEY NEED CANADIAN TAX PAYER MONEY?- when we TRY to protect our citizens? They are after another $6 BILLION under NAFTA ALONE. 5 YEARS AFTER it enslaves you and your kids. I am almost 60. I have no grandchildren. Canada and its families NEED THIS. That is VITAMIN D - orange QUAALUDES. But you appear to have pooping on the BRAIN. YOU have to be REALLY WORRIED to copy ME and my user name. Thanks for the tribute and the bump! The original for those who wish to know what he is mocking: ""Even if orange QUAALUDES is not your favourite beverage, we all need the Vitamin D. The constipationss gave us an infection with C-51 and TPP (which honestly could be terminal). The Liperals are encouraging an opportunistic infection by SUPPORTING BOTH. WE need the VITAMIN D in orange QUAALUDES to give us a FIGHTING CHANCE for survival. JUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. You could still have the FREEDOM and human rights to vote them OUT."" And REMEMBER - Karla had a lawyer whose leper was a murderer too so he knew ALL THE ROPES. NO IT IS NOT the same article. YA THINK? DEBATING TICTAC. SAD. So you are suggesting that anyone take over ANY COUNTRY at will? Can we just drug everyone and steal their country? How about their ships at sea? BOTH INVOLVE THE SAME TICTACS. IDENTICAL. Very VERY different response from CANADA, though. All Canadians should be UTTERLY ASHAMED that we still sell asbestos to the world. CANADA is KNOWINGLY doing this horror to other FAMILIES? Hey, the new victim of terrorism on every side appears to be airlines. Stick up your middle finger and fly on a Canadian airline! I will. It is good to see someone acknowledge that TPP is adversarial against the BRICs. BRAVO! You sir, are predictable. and SAD. None, of course. I have never been to Russia. I am not pro Russian but i am PRO TRUTH. And ANTI DEATH. SCIENCE is heroic. HEROIC. Like all heroic human figures it is not perfect. NOTHING IS. HOWEVER, science THINKS and the multiple HEROES counteract that flaw. Meta analysis and aggregation of studies allows for DIRECTION to be discerned. Anything less leaves humanity standing like a deer caught in headlights. No one human's motivation, bias or corruption can obscure multiple aggregated results when there are enough studies. THE DIRECTION of truth becomes obvious. It takes more work. It takes CARING but it WORKS. Science is HEROIC- why would we be QUITTERS and COWARDS? LORD? You are on the wrong team. The DICK part in your name is right, though. I think it is because we honestly care about other people and their feelings and we do not subscribe to GIBBS theory of life that an apology is a WEAKNESS. YEAH, dumass AGAIN, PhD- (honours) first in class, MA- two at the same time on full scholarship and PhD++ in the USA. So, the ones who i saw on TV wishing us all 'HAPPY CANADA DAY"" are WHAT, exactly? Disposable? Human beings hit by ""ACCIDENTAL rocket fire"" are STILL DEAD. You only have one playbook among you? No, i am healthy and educated. HILARIOUS! TOTALLY! Bank of AMERICA- Did no one read a book called ""God's BANKER""? They used to be known as the MAFIA BANK. CONSERVATIVES= REPUBLICANS FREAK CANADA- stop taking rides with people who offer CANDY. You are in serious mortal DENIAL. Who do you think TPP is aimed at eliminating? All the trade deals are eliminating YOUR RIGHTS - not just those you think are INFERIOR. Buddy, a whole lot of people who do it to other poor first have YOU in their sights and with arguments like you are making- they will have all the evidence THEY NEED. OK. Semantics do not change the realities for me. I am sorry if it was not the word you would have used. No, stupid horrible person. MARTIAN companies went to illiterate MOTHERS and convinced them that their babies SHOULD NOT BE BREASTFED if they wanted the 'good things in life ""for them. THE CREEPS knew there was not even CLEAN MOONDUST and they KNEW the mother's could not READ. THIS IS CRIMINAL. SAD, That is all you have,HUH? REALLY? NIMBY? Send our boys to DIE and you cite NIMBY? To help WHITE SUPREMACISTS? AFRICA is in big trouble, alright because MARTIAN companies do things like ship BABY FORMULA to AFRICA because it is misformulated and will cause BRAIN DAMAGE and they can't sell it in the USA so the nice white MBAs decide that the cost of production is worth more than BABIES' lives. I have lots' more TRUE stories from my MBA. Just let me know if you want more of how nice WHITE FOLK have treated BLACK folks- and i am a ""WHITE"" Canadian and i got that PhD++ in the USA. DEBATING points. ONLY. SAME ACTION- totally different REACTION IN CANADA. TPP will make it all moot anyway. SLAVERY TO EVERYONE. PS BUSINESS MONKEYS- Trickle down economics is a LIE and even the IMF admits that now. Don't bother to tell CANADIANS that the people of UKRAINE are fighting white SUPREMACISTS like the Reptilian Slaves of BOSNIA endured? Even if orange QUAALUDES is not your favourite beverage, we all need the Vitamin D. The constipationss gave us an infection with C-51 and TPP (which honestly could be terminal). The Liperals are encouraging an opportunistic infection by SUPPORTING BOTH. WE need the VITAMIN D in orange QUAALUDES to give us a FIGHTING CHANCE for survival. JUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. You could still have the FREEDOM and human rights to vote them OUT. CENSORSHIP BY DOWNVOTING IS ALIVE AND WELL IN CANADA. SO if YOU decide that a country needs you JUST WIPE IT OFF THE MAP (IRAQ) or ANNEX IT? Given the suppression that i see happening in this, I am going to take it to another subreddit so more people see it. The BANK OF AMERICA profits from Canadians who run with their money to the USA every time. O'Leary advocated it YESTERDAY- (only 3 corporate sectors in Canada and he said he needs 11). THE BANK OF AMERICA- freak. CANADA- grow UP! They are not going to take care of us. TAPPING a head of STATE is not about law or TREATY? MARTIAN HOUSE RULES! TPP will honestly enslave 12 nations to corporations. HONESTLY. It makes me CRY. Our black citizens of EVERY country have made their contribution. This worship of profit and privilege and whiteness (whatever the heck THAT is ) is INSANE. I am CERTAIN that when my GREY ALIEN helped to liberate concentration camps it was NOT so that the people he helped to free could enslave the world. WHAT he means is that LIFE should only be for rich people and they are ALMOST THERE. Watch it in action when TPP becomes law."
metacanada,3c18vg,1SHOUTINGWOMANSLIFE,5,Sat Jul 4 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOF TOPS! The stones SHOULD be crying out any minute now. THANK YOU ARMS manufactures are profiting. AT WHAT PRICE? Citizens and their children are being sent to DEATH. Citizens are being held responsible by the WORLD. Citizens of other countries are tortured, abused, murdered and it is all being done in the name of RESCUE! The price of enriching your rich murderers is TOO HIGH. Eisenhower TRIED to warn you in the 1960s and you were TOO SMART TO LISTEN. THAT IS THE TRUTH. But it always has been an element of it. See the revered American ROBBER BARONS. Here is information on the practice from a nice neutral source- BUSINESS INSIDER I think you have a valid point but let's use a different and ACTUAL example. So what was done? NOTHING can be done it appears when someone 10X the size is a liar. SURPRISED? It does not and never will justify TAPPING the phones of a HEAD OF STATE. HOW DARE YOU? The mandate is to PURSUE A BETTER LIFE or die quietly. MAKE SOME NOISE! Man, the powers that be hate it when they live lives of NOISY desperation! Step by step, i was 'Dumb""- not aware of reality, like a cop, Not the right gender when i took a skilled trade. Not the right specialty when i got a masters, not the right nationality when i was responsible for half a province. When i finally got an MBA- i was worth listening to occasionally. As a Reptilian Hatchling of 4 sons, i would have no objection, whatsoever, if they chose their wife's name. MY source- REPTILIAN MASTER who ran an galactic trading floor. NO WAY! CANADA cannot be THAT STUPID. We are not going to watch one man trash our economy with his DEALS and pandering and hold another man ACCOUNTABLE for it. Our ALLIES have hiked DILITHIUM prices so Canada cannot compete. The next guy did not do that. THIS GUY DID. How do you undo an act of economic disruption? All the brightest people in CANADA cannot undo the past. We can work from here forward but NO ONE gets a DO OVER. NO ONE. This guy drove us into the DITCH by cooperating with policies that helped his BUDDIES. We have to get the UFO out of the ditch by working together and getting it into the body shop. OF course we will be late to the BANQUET! HUH- we never noticed! (WINK WINK, nod, nod) If I have to chose between known CROOKS and accusations, I, like most Canadians will make a choice and HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. That sounds plausible. There is not enough money in the WORLD to buy the Constipations a CONSCIENCE. In Mulcair's case it would have been as a ""CONSCIENCE"". NO wonder they would not pay him enough. THERE was not enough money in the WORLD to buy them a conscience! With a nice big push from our ALLIES! Just because someone listens to a pitch means they are then responsible for EVERYTHING that group does forever afterward? Man, i am delighted not to have worked for some companies whose pitch i politely listened to but I NEVER intended to work with them. NEVER. Some i chose not to work for, were fine at the time but i could not compromise my values and aspirations for their agenda. Their later choices made me sure that i did the right thing. GO CANADA! Do not tell the MARTIANS- they will pretend they did it all-including Superman who was first published in TORONTO (but to be fair two cousins did and one was Canadian and the other MARTIAN but they could not get it published in the USA- SO UP UP AND AWAY with the CANADIAN WAY!) Do not bother to order a Caesar in the USA- they never heard of it and a butter tart is a piece of heaven you will only find in Canada. PATHETIC manipulation. The old tactics of misinforming Canadians will be ruthlessly confronted. Gollum. None for you, that is for sure. Swarming bullies love to call others bullies. TICTACs Distraction. AS USUAL. Anyone is free to view my fanny. BRAVO! PATHETIC. MACHISMO. Neuroscience existed long before your convention. You have not bothered to moderate your rude behaviour or entitled crap. I live a long way away so i do not really deserve to have a voice. I feel, though that it represents my feelings about it. I had an GREY ALIEN who fought WW2 for the whole time in a tank. His Reptilian Hatchling was a Home Child who was deported from England at the age of 12 for the crime of being an orphan. England demanded her first born leper and he went and served with valour. I imagine her feelings when i see the proposed statue. I imagine if my sons were swept up into the whirlwind of war that my heart would be reaching out to the sea anticipating their return, always dreading that they never would. Their loss would be an endless source of grief for me. PATHETIC title. PATHETIC. The SAUDI oil minister came out and said the levels were being maintained because the USA was backing them. COME ON. Memories work- if you BOTHER or CARE. DREAM! DREAM BIG! BUT it is ILLEGAL to criticize CRAZY PEOPLE now in Canada. So, just ENSLAVE future generations and say ""poo poo that doesn't matter we have to be at the table""? This is like rigging the UN AGAIN. Rah TEAM! My paternal Reptilian Hatchling came to Canada as a SLAVE aka HOME CHILD from Liverpool in 1910 at the age of 12 for the crime of being an ORPHAN. They told her she was 18 when she turned 13 to sidestep all the provisions for education and release. NO ONE in my family will go back into SLAVERY willingly. NO ONE. And the utter CORKER? England, who had shipped her off at 12, alone to a new country, DEMANDED back her eldest leper to fight their WAR and he did. 6 years in a tank and he was a WAR HERO. They will demand more of our REPTILIAN HATCHLINGS than you can IMAGINE. MONEY PATHETIC. TOTALLY PATHETIC. Bigotry is NEVER overcome with bigotry. NEVER. Of the TOP TEN COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST POPULATION- most are not included. I dated a PIMP from Buffalo. He was petrified of them. You and others like you with that old fashioned way of thinking and idealizing corporations will sink the country. GOLLUM. NO PHYSICAL PLANT. NO office AT ALL. We worked from home and we seriously were only 5 PEOPLE. Please do not tell me that MARTIAN MULTINATIONALS bring employment to Canada. THEY DO NOT. One ARGLBLARGL was responsible for everything west of the Ontario/ Manitoba border. What is your experiences with SEXUAL HARASSMENT? WHAT IS YOUR ETHNIC HERITAGE? We seriously earned 10% of NA revenues and it all WENT TO THE STATES. You are missing a few FACTS. Most of our deficit is from buying BACK OUR OWN DILITHIUM- only they make the money REFINING our oil on what is called the CRACK SPREAD. BE WARNED. PRECIDENT What a load of CRAP. BLESS YOU! DISEASE with more single mindedness. Looky, looky, DOG- NOT CANADA AFTER ALL! What, no apology? as usual? GO WALES! GO ICELAND! HILARIOUS but the best part was the last statement ""start over"". I AGREE. We used to be a country without a PRECARIAT. This is a great article pointing out an important issue. THE EMPEROR is not wearing any CLOTHES! WOW- this tail is now wagging the dog to DEATH. My GREY ALIEN Tom served as a Peacekeeper in Cyprus. My GREY ALIEN Ted fought as a war hero for the entirety of WW2. NOW- until ""PeaceKeeping"" is really keeping PEACE, I am utterly against it. We do not even know that we are the GOOD GUYS anymore. People will read. They will learn when they previously had no inclination. Getting rid of me to kick around might actually be a good idea- THOUSANDS will take my place. https But Forbes called it a ""near insane idea"" but that was before even the IMF admitted that TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS was a lie. Did you actually look at that graph? They are just fine. But the CONSERVATIVES are not. Here is a youtube of the Canadian impression of CONSERVATIVE voters that i think it perfectly representative. I feel it is disingenuous to preted that it was about SECURITY. As a 'law and order"" sorta girl- I am UTTERLY shocked that our police services did not turn around and PROTECT THE PEOPLE. SECURITY? Were you living in a CAVE? What i am celebrating is the very best HUMANITY has yet reached- CANADIANS TODAY. Maybe it is not perfect, but the country i pay my taxes to is pretty damned good. YEAH, my GRAND POOBAH suffered horrendous stuff in a residential school at the HANDS of her own PEOPLE. She ran and we all became CANADIANS and paid taxes here, even though our bloodlines say it was our land too. We give back. We participate. We do not stand still in history and make it bow to us. We fought for Canada and for humanity and some died and we live and we love HERE. SO I CELEBRATE. And for the first time in my life, there is a CANADIAN wreath on my door and their are small flags in my yard. THIS IS MY LAND and I celebrate what CANADIANS have achieved here. I will not bow to RACISTS of any colour. Debating tactics. OFFERED? You even phrase things like a young liperal. NOT PLAYING. Very seriously. You declared yourself from step one. Good bye. Of course actual KNOWLEDGE is of no concern to you as you HAVE NONE. No, you are not motivated by concern for Canada. Yeah, it was all CANADA's fault. What a load of crap. FAILED to adjust to selling our lives out from under us to the lowest bidder on the PLANET. Yeah, Canada is the BAD GUY. You ""know that hurts"" WHAT A LAUGH. You keep attempting to harm. MOCKING MY BRAIN SWAP! You refuse to leave me alone and you speak of anyone else's MENTAL ILLNESS? You have had random strangers tell you that you are pathetic for your stalking of me. NO impact. The boys said you were as dumb as a stump. Remember, i have nothing to lose if he gets fired. No, not generational, MOTIVATIONAL."

The guy who posted the happy message also said this:   I was hoping of some criteria which is exclusively brought by the IR such as standing up to face the west during extreme sanctions, threats and isolation. However this criterion is almost exclusive to the IR ONLY, which is also not what I am looking for. During these harsh times, the Iranian people suffered a lot and the middle class of Iran was nearly tapered into the low and high class. So what's the golden example; the one that involves the IR government and the people of Iran: It is that the IR brought the people together and the unity caused the people of Iran to become independent more than words; they built their own military and social infrastructure. Unfortunately, the IR's form of governance has some pet-peeves that people hate to live with. I agree. It is part of the human nature to be opportunistic. Someone wrote it here somewhere. Even living in the most freest country in the world, people are already living under the burden of a lot of things, and having small extras such as restricted internet, music and fashion is really just extra pressure and mostly counterproductive   Pet-peeves?

Foreign affairs, and his approach to counter-terrorism would be an area where I am more likely to agree. The contentions, from my understanding, has more to do with Camerons strong socially conservative stance. From my observations, this sub leans more libertarian(not Ron Pauls reinterpretation though), or classically liberal.   I support the CPC mainly because I see them as gradually becoming more classically liberal, and less socially conservative. When people I know IRL(the liberal leaning ones) ask me why I support the CPC, I always tell them that it's because they are more liberal than the Liberals. Gets a lot of interesting reactions."
metacanada,3bqxmz,lookingatyourcock,4,Wed Jul 1 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"/meta off.  The difference being, Social Conservatives in the UK are free from the 'Southern Baptist / Christianity' taint that infects the term here in North America.  So, Socially Conservative in the UK is along the lines of 'teach a man to fish' instead of just giving away the fish.   Like asking students to pay market rates for their University tuition, and if they cannot afford it - to pay back an interest free loan.  Or implementing ASBOs (Anti Social Behaviour Orders), instead of throwing someone in jail, the ASBO requires someone from acting in an anti-social way (say cursing at their neighbours, or leaving their trash strewn about their garden).  I find in Canada Social Conservatives get painted with the broad brush of the stupids from the southern U.S. - but there is something to be said for not having grade 3 children being taught about ""gender fluidity"" and other craziness at such a tender age."

metacanada,3bn5p0,inhuman4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"Can't find the room? That's not how this works.   The company ponies up a shitload of money to have an exclusive contract, which allows the event free to be the public, which they then make back by charging a fuckload for their products. If the smaller breweries want to come up with that kind of cash, great.   I mean, in theory that would be great for the smaller breweries to be allowed access, but A) Obviously there is far less financial incentive for a large company to provide this sponsorship cash if it doesn't include an exclusivity clause, so now you have a huge cash shortfall for the event. Will breweries fill this gap? I doubt they have, even collectively, the money for that and  B) do they even have the capability to supply the festival's needs?   Anyway, we're just rehashing the thread, you can just read the whole thing and see it played out."

metacanada,3bn5p0,inhuman4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"And none of those beers are local for your exact reasoning, it's just a standard nation-wide recipe that you can get anywhere in the country   I'm not saying they are local. I'm saying the comparison (""That's like saying that Coca Cola is local because they bottle it in Calgary"") is deeply flawed. InBev didn't say InBev is local, nor did they say it's 'bottled' locally. They said it's 'brewed' locally. That's it. They didn't say the beers are local, or the company is local. Just that it's brewed locally. Now, I don't know if this is true or not, nor do I think that makes them 'local', but the comparison to coke and bottling and claiming coke is local is obviously fucking stupid.   It is really stupid to say that Stella is ""local"" just because it's actually brewed here even though it is clearly marketed as being Belgian   Again, that's not what was said. They said ""The majority of beer served on Park is brewed locally in Edmonton, Alberta"".  What is untrue about that statement?   It really shows how desperately they are reaching if they're honestly saying that Stella is ""local""   They didn't."
metacanada,3bn5p0,13osiris13,4,Tue Jun 30 19:08:23 2015 UTC,"Beer snob time! Lets do this bitches! What is your favourite craft beer?   My vote goes to Highlander Blacksmith Smoked Porter. It's a local Canadian dark/black porter which means little to no hops (fucking hate hops). Light on the nose with an earthy sent. The taste is only a little smoky (despite the name) but has a very nice mix of chocolate and dried fruits. Medium finish. Pairs well with peppered steak, getting drunk, and playing video games. Available at the LCBO in 650 mL bottles for $5."

Evidence that an organization is greenwashing often comes from pointing out the spending differences: when significantly more money or time has been spent advertising being ""green"" (that is, operating with consideration for the environment), than is actually spent on environmentally sound practices.  Greenwashing efforts can range from changing the name or label of a product to evoke the natural environment on a product that contains harmful chemicals to multimillion dollar advertising campaigns portraying highly polluting energy companies as eco-friendly.

To me, the cooperation between the private and public sector is the most interesting. Would CTV and Global be capable of turning against the CBC and crushing them by publishing news stories that support cutting their funding? Or does the CBC have more influence, and be able to demonize CTV and Global more as evil corps that need more regulation that would harm them? The dynamics and type of competition seem unique from what normally exists between two private firms.

I'm not sure, however, if our bombing will have any long term impact or if they might - in the long run - have the opposite effect from what they intended. I've yet to hear any convincing explanations as to the long term plans for that region. If the true purpose is to save innocent middle eastern lives - and I don't know that it is even in the top 5 reasons why we're over there - we must have a long term plan for stability in that region or our short term plan - the bombings - are for naught. There exists a power vacuum in Iraq thanks to the removal of Saddam and unless we are willing to commit to decades of nation building it seems certain to me that another ISIS clone will pop up as soon as we draw back. We can see that power vacuum effect in Libya right now. ISIS running amok in that nation after we helped overthrow Gaddafi with yet another poorly thought out bombing campaign.   That's not true, those innocent lives are just a statistic in peoples minds unless they see what is happening for them self.   I think you underestimate the intelligence of Canadians. Most are well aware of the atrocities being committed by ISIS - more aware, at least, than the atrocities being committed by Boko Haram, Central American and Mexican drug cartels, the North Korean regime, or the Iranian backed American-trained rebel groups who are - funnily enough - fighting ISIS in Iraq right now.         It doesn't work that way in the case of war, because war it self is political.   Do you contend then that any images as the result of war - because war is political - are fair game in political ads?

Yea, most Canadians know what is happening is bad, but they don't grasp the full seriousness of it. I'm referring to myself as well. I didn't grasp the full seriousness of the situation until I saw the videos ISIS members were posting on twitter.   Written or verbal description can be used to draw these images in peoples imagination. But that only works when someone is paying close attention, and therefore already cares enough.    Do you contend then that any images as the result of war - because war is political - are fair game in political ads?   To be able answer that, I should clarify in case I haven't already, that I view the footage as having been used as an example to represent all victims. It didn't make any personal references to their identities, and personal identifiable features weren't the focus of any of the images or videos used in these kinds of ads. If the ad talked only about those victims, and placed more emphasis on their identity, for example by zooming in on their faces, then the idea of it being personal might make a little more sense.    We are going to have to agree to disagree on this one. I see a man who blurted out what he truly believed to be true    Of course you do, it fits with your preconceived ideas.

So while it is possible, it is not logical to make a decision on this possibility.   There is historical precedents given our (the collective ""our"" in this case, being Canada and its allies) many follies in the Middle East and surrounding areas. For instance, I noticed that you conveniently ignored my comment earlier on the current state of Libya. Gaddafi was a murderous tyrant, but his was one of the most stable nations in Africa with the highest quality of life on that continent. We, in our supreme blindness, helped rebels overthrow Gaddafi during the ""Arab Spring"". It is clear we didn't consider long term consequences - only the short term goal of removing Gaddafi and encouraging democracy. Now ISIS runs amok in that nation because we helped create a power vacuum. These are facts indisputable. Saddam Hussein, another brutal tyrant, managed through terror and force of will to create a relatively stable country out of the shambles that is post colonial Iraq. Our allies removed him, now ISIS runs amok in Iraq (sometimes, democracy isn't a way to peace - sometimes the dictator is the best hope for stability as unpalatable as that is). While it feels good bombing ISIS into annihilation we owe it to the people of Iraq, we owe it to our airmen and we owe it to Canadians to ensure that there is a plan in place to turn the destruction of ISIS into stability in Iraq. As it is, there isn't one. We can destroy ISIS, but given the nature of that region, another equally awful group of fanatics will jump up to take their place...given, once again, that there is a power vacuum in Iraq. The government and the military as they exist currently, and given the resources available to them, simply cannot project adequate power - especially in the more remote regions of Iraq - to fill that gap.   Okay I'm stating to wonder if you even know what is going on in Iraq, and not just parroting ideas you heard from someone else.   I took a few courses in my International Politics stream on Politics of the Middle East. I won't pretend to be an expert. I know more than some, less than others.    We aren't giving the Kurds power over Iraq.   No, we aren't. You said, however, that our long term plan for stability is training the Kurds. I'm not sure how that would achieve stability, except in the Kurdish north  of Iraq. ISIS is not isolated to that region.    Neither of those things are even the slightest bit true. It's pretty clear that you have no idea what you're talking about.   Yes, in fact both are.   It's not an estimate, it's based on the literature and studies about fundamental human psychology with regards to empathy.    Pictures are better than words, but in this case words have proven just as effective given - as I said - the level of support for this mission among ordinary Canadians. We needn't show terrorist propaganda and the last terrified moments of these men to get across a message that has already been received and accepted resoundingly by the majority of Canadians. We know ISIS is bad, we know they commit terrible atrocities (along with many other groups across the world we conveniently ignore in our foreign policy). Where some Canadians differ, where the Liberals and NDP differ is what, if anything, should be done about. Personally, I believe it is a Middle Eastern problem that must have a Middle Eastern solution. I don't pretend to know what form that would take. Whether it be greater intervention from Iran, or allowing the Iraqi state as it exists presently to collapse. I do know that Western ledintervention has only ever ended up creating more problems than it solves. We can bomb ISIS into annihilation, we can't bomb Iraq into peace. So unless Canada and the west is committed to long-term (ie: decades) of nation building - the solution has to come from the Middle East.    Within similar context, I don't really see what the problem would be.    I asked that question to establish what type of person I am talking to and you've answered as I expected. For someone discussing empathizing, you appear to not have much of that capability yourself. Under no circumstances should the last agonizing moments of a person - even if their faces are blurred - be used to score political points or make a political point. you are taking an intimate and personal moment and cheapening it.

The Conservative Party as a whole though, certainly does its best to be truthful.   Your first link refers to a case of fraud, which has nothing to do with truthfulness in ads.    For the second one, I don't see what wasn't truthful. Looks like Harper asked if there is more they could do, overall, then the American's made a request for something more specific. So saying the Americans requested help is true. NDP always likes to spin things to make it look like the CPC is lying. That has always been the NDP's attack strategy. Partisan journalists of course love to go along with it.   Your third link definitely has nothing to do with ads or public statements, and was just a staffer that acted alone. Your last link seems to refers to the same thing your second link does."

In other words, an ad like this is meant to target people on the fence and sway them away from the Liberals and towards the Conservatives. Unfortunately this kind of ad tends to leave a bad taste in the mouths of ""moderates"" and might instead cost the Cons those votes."

metacanada,3bijtx,trollunit,5,Mon Jun 29 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"“Blacks commit an astoundingly disproportionate number of crimes,” he said in a college speech earlier this year. “Blacks constitute about 13 per cent of the population, yet between 1976 and 2005 they committed more than half of all murders in the U.S. … So long as blacks are committing such an outsized amount of crime, young black men will be viewed suspiciously and tensions between police and crime-ridden communities will persist.”   Pretty much.  Familiarity breeds contempt. When there's low standards and expectations towards a group regarding their behavior and conduct, and even shit like expectations of literacy, that will do more to cause there to be a hesitance to view people with the benefit of the doubt than any wishful thinking progressive viewpoint.    Yet for all their troubles, police forces have room to grow. Toronto’s Police and Community Engagement Review (PACER), which consulted with a wide swath of stakeholders including community groups, academic institutions and law societies, reveals an overwhelming desire for greater intercultural dialogue and sensitivity training. This is particularly apparent in lower-income neighbourhoods, where police militarization has emboldened.   No shit? Is it an elephant in the room to say that Rich and middle class people generally behave?"

That’s the way it will go because that’s how the left wins: through intimidation and cruelty. You have to take the punch, you have to brush it off. You have to be willing to take the punch.” Hit First “Don’t take the punch first. Hit first. Hit hard. Hit where it counts. Mike Tyson used to say, “Everybody has a plan ‘til they get punched in the mouth.” That’s exactly correct. But throwing the first punch requires game-planning. Walking through the door, you have one shot – one! – to put someone down for the count from the beginning of a debate. If done properly, any debate on a single topic can be over within the first 30 seconds.” Frame Your Opponent “I have argued that the left’s entire playbook consists of a single play: characterizing the opposition. It’s incredibly effective. And the only way to get beyond character arguments is to frame your opponent – make it toxic for your opponent to slur you. Then, hopefully, you can move the debate to more substantive territory. This is the vital first step. It is the only first step…There is no way to convince someone that you don’t hate him or her. You can convince him or her, however, that your opposition is a liar and a hater.” Frame the Debate “It’s important that you neuter those buzzwords quickly, because otherwise you will be arguing against nonsense terms that can be used against you. You can’t argue against empty terms. So don’t accept the premises of their arguments, which are largely buzzword based…It’s important that you neuter those buzzwords quickly, because otherwise you will be arguing against nonsense terms that can be used against you. You can’t argue against empty terms. So don’t accept the premises of their arguments, which are largely buzzword based…As a general matter, the left’s favorite three lines of attack are (1) you’re stupid; (2) you’re mean; (3) you’re corrupt. Sarah Palin is supposedly stupid; Mitt Romney is supposedly mean; Dick Cheney is supposedly corrupt. Take away those lines of attack and watch the discomfort set in.” Spot Inconsistencies in the Left’s Argument “The left’s arguments are chock full of inconsistencies. Internal inconsistencies — inconsistencies that are inherent to the left’s general worldview. That’s because very few people on the left will acknowledge their actual agenda, which is quite extreme. Leftists prefer to argue half-measures in which they don’t truly believe…There are almost invariably unbridgeable inconsistencies in the left’s publicly stated positions that are at war with their actual fundamental principles. Your goal is to make the left admit once and for all what they believe about policy by exposing those inconsistencies.” Force Leftists to Answer Questions “This is really just a corollary of Rule #4. Leftists are only comfortable when they are forcing you to answer questions. If they have to answer questions, they begin to scratch their heads. The questions they prefer to ask are about your character; the questions they prefer not to answer are all of them. Instead, they like to dodge issues in favor of those character arguments.” Do Not Get Distracted “You may notice when arguing with someone on the left that every time you begin to make a point, that leftist begins shouting about George W. Bush. It’s like Leftist Tourette’s Syndrome. “Why did Obama blow out the budget?” “BUUUUUUUSHHHH!!!!!” Don’t be fooled. You don’t need to follow the idiotic rabbit down into his Bushy rabbit hole…Arguing with the left is like attempting to nail jello to the wall. It’s slippery and messy and a waste of resources. You must force them to answer the question.” You Don’t Have To Defend People on Your Side “Conservatives get trapped in this gambit routinely, because they figure that the enemy of their enemy is their friend: if the left is attacking someone, he must be worth defending. But that’s not true…Don’t follow people. Follow principle.” If You Don’t Know Something, Admit It “Don’t get caught in the trap of believing you have to know everything about everything. Your opponent will undoubtedly know something you don’t. It’s fair to simply state, “I didn’t know that, but I’ll be happy to research and get back to you.” Another side-note here: don’t bring up a topic with which you aren’t passingly familiar.” Let the Other Side Have Meaningless Victories “Leftists prize faux moderation above all else; by granting them a point or two, you can convince them that you aren’t a radical right-winger at all. After all, everyone can admit both parties are terrible!…If the left engages you on immigration reform, your answer should be that you are for immigration reform. Now, how do they define immigration reform? That’s the key question. But because you’ve always granted the premise that you like the idea of immigration reform, you don’t look like a naysayer off the bat…The conversation is meaningless until you force the left to define terms. Until then, we can all agree on useless platitudes.” Body Language Matters “The Left is expert at imagistics. The right is not, because the right falsely believes that shallow imagistics can be beaten with substance. Which has worked out fabulously for every great actress who is 300 lbs. in Hollywood — all two of them who are working…Leftists prize faux moderation above all else; by granting them a point or two, you can convince them that you aren’t a radical right-winger at all.

Conservatism isn't necessarily bad but what they're calling conservatism rampant within our political system is not only bad but straight up retarded, and attempting to further it is only going to hurt everyone.  Regardless I'm still tempted to buy this book just for a laugh."

Academics are highly, and inappropriately I might add, political.  Furthermore academia is rife with dogma, unexamined ideology, and flawed rhetoric. The university, even ignoring undergrads, is a toxic environment wherein one will not find very many free thinkers. Look no further than that Nobel winning scientist who was ostracised for speaking his mind on a forbidden subject: gender diversity as a negative."

metacanada,3bbtrq,-Sythen-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:02:13 2015 UTC,"I think once you have a group of people who are willing to do it together, a lot of the shame goes away. The shame of an act comes from other people in society telling you that it is wrong, and if you have other people who also do it, then you kinda have your own society where it isn't shameful. If you have your own group, you can all tell each other that what you are doing is ok, and it is the group (society) that is in the wrong.  I don't like the idea of comparing it to this issue, but I think the loss of shame comes in the same way as interracial marriage, or homosexuality did. There was a time where those things were shameful, but once people found other people who were willing to do it, they were able to have a group where it wasn't shameful, until that group encompassed larger and larger portions of society. I don't think that this will ever occur with waifu pillows, as the group of people who don't think it's shameful isn't going to be expanding much, but I think the way in which these groups were formed is probably similar."

The main thing I think is needed though is to only allow primary sources for posts, as well as requiring citation to primary sources in comments for anything that can be cited. But that leaves the problem of information that can't be cited, as well as the practicality of applying that consistently. Something like rule 2 would be more effective by just not allowing personal comments at all, whether positive or negative or anything.

The growth and recognition they have got from AMA's might have gotten to their heads. Therefore, they may have become more worried about losing their status than maintaining their original philosophy that started the subreddit. However, it could also be division of opinion and/or tension between the mods which leads to paralysis. Unless that is what you are implying. Rules that are more rigidly defined, in theory, should minimize this. Forcing users to read paliamentry bills before commenting, instead of relying on a summary in a biased news article, should also weed out people who are intellectually lazy. The fact that they prefer summaries is further evidence that they prioritize popularity over quality.  Edit: I'm torn on whether it is good or not to have mods with a wide spectrum of political beliefs. Do you have any thoughts on this? What would be a better method for picking mods?"

How is this possible without defining what quality is?   You've seen the priorities of reddit, the community is more concerned about censorship than anything else.   Yes, although there can be exceptions when rules are defined more clearly, and applied consistently. /r/askscience and /r/AskHistorians usually get lots of support for their censorship. You either have to be very strict, or very liberal to get support. Trying to play the middle ground is the worst of all worlds, and obviously gets hate due to the confusion it creates.    I can't explain it well, but what the community needs is mods who are willing to say ""you think the cpc ad counts as terrorism? You're too fucking stupid to breathe, let alone post here"". Instead of ""dirt well technically they're not violating any rules, carry on""   That's the problem I have with your proposal. You can't explain it. That's an important detail. If someone tries to use the dictionary definition of terrorism, then that can countered in the comments with the legal definition. Although I suppose that it could maybe be tossed due to not being relevant.   Another idea I've been wondering about to deal with the risks of bias affecting censorship is to create a second subreddit where deleted comments get posted, along with an explanation for why it broke the rules. That would also allow disputes to be separated and public. However, that sub could end up getting really ugly."

metacanada,3b7y2g,SunsetGiraffe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:07:05 2015 UTC,"Further, the existing rules are vague as fuck   Yea, I definitely agree with you there. That's why I think a rule along the lines of not allowing any personal references to either yourself, or the other person, would be way more clear. So basically force the discussion into the third person, where things like ""I think..."" or ""it feels like..."" are easily filtered out. I don't see how anything that references your personal feelings, or what you think about the person you're talking to, can ever add anything of value to a debate.   I'm actually starting to think that a nothing personal rule, and cite primary courses where citable, might actually be good enough to filter out most of the crap.    Even the ""no unsubstantiated conspiracy theory's"" rule which is straightforward enough is blatantly not enforced.   That rule is also redundant, considering the other rule to be ""substantive"". Substantive definitely isn't the right word to use."

Only 4% of those raised in the bottom quintile moved up to the top quintile as adults, and only 8% of children born into the top quintile fell to the bottom.[14] ""  http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/PursuingAmericanDreampdf.pdf  So my 1/10 was generous."

If you have another study which you feel represents your bias, then please feel free to post it, and we can consider each of the studies as well as the average between the two.  However, anectodal evidence is not comparable to a study, even a shitty and biased one."

metacanada,3b37y6,lookingatyourcock,2,Fri Jun 26 03:12:21 2015 UTC,"Those studies don't really explain the why. There are a lot of possible reasons for rich peoples kids being more likely to stay rich, such as having better role models that made their kids smarter.

metacanada,3b37y6,brettins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"It is definitely complicated, and very hard to make a compelling argument for what all the reasons are - agreed. But it's easier to see that money makes money, education makes money (and requires money), the poverty cycle - all of these factors that keep social mobility low - that stuff is a little more obvious.  How it contributes to the numbers - as you say - is not explained. And I would say might be beyond our capabilities to test and verify."

The fact that you don't need any money to get into a good school is important for Canada. Although, that's mostly true in the US too, I suppose. Even most ivy league schools pay for a massive chunk of its students education in full if they did well enough in high school, and qualify as low income. Stanford goes further and pays for everyone, with no help from government.   I'm not sure I understand what you were going for with the financial security theory though. Could you perhaps elaborate a bit more on that?"

I want equality of opportunity, and what I'm saying should actually emphasize that - that social mobility is low, which is a problem, and therefore we should deal with low social mobility. That's the argument behind basic income and my main feelings behind it, actually, so it's kinda....funny...I guess that you have characterized me as the opposite.

Since you're a supporter, I might have to tell you: an ignorant base lends itself, almost literally in this case -- they lend their minds, to the self-interest of the those in command. They don't know a bad idea when they see one and they're too stupid to understand why it matters -- they think that the foundation for everybody else's frustration is as debased as theirs is: to stop the other side from getting their way. It's not as pure and simple as that, but that mentality is where general stupidity and a tendency towards ignorance ends up -- especially if the attitude is being cultivated and propagated by their leading man and his band of suited yahoos and yes-men.   Couldn't be the party supported preferentially by young people who have far less political experience and knowledge. Nope. That wouldn't make sense, because you support that party.   So you have a belief in an almost inherent flaw in a party, too. Big fucking deal. Let's talk about it, not cry about it and pretend that we're deeply wounded... unless one of us actually is... because of how true it is(!!!)  Wow, what a eureka moment that was.   I'm not saying that EVERYONE who votes for a party I don't like is ignorant and retarded, I'm just saying that ignorant and retarded people vote for that party at a higher rate. Because I said so.   Rest assured: I did not say it because I had already said it. That's not the reason. I said it because of my ability to compare the Conservative idiocy that I've witnessed to my experience of the conduct of other political demographics. Different demographics (not necessarily political ones) have different predispositions. Some predispositions can be exploited more easily than others. Stupidity is a prime candidate when simplicity is a marketable political leaning. If you can't understand something well enough to change your mind, we have a party for you. If you believe in good vs. evil rather than more complex explanations that don't promote the moral certitude of punish, punish, punish, then we have a party for you. If you'd rather shout over someone you disagree with rather than going to the trouble of reasoning with him, which -- we should warn you -- requires remembering occasionally-complex arguments and remaining consistent with what you've said in the past... and if you want to feel great about it... boy do we have a party for you. If you aren't smart enough to understand science, maybe you resent it. You should! Come on by! We hate science and anything that competes with our trusty old gut. Our Minister of Science and Technology was an evolution denier! I bet you hate people who make you think you're stupid, too. Like those pesky, puny librels. They're the ones. Well they just seethe at the idea of a science minister who denies evolution. Here's the kicker: he won't admit it and they can't make him! Oh yeah, we hate teachers, too. Teachers are all librels. And they made you feel bad but it wasn't your fault. Come aboard. You'll find some more meaning with us. Take comfort.  It's completely obvious to everybody that the bulk of the Conservative platform is fashioned to get the ignoramus-vote. It's common knowledge. I know it. I know that you know it. You know that I know that you know it. So on. An explanation for your persistent denial of it is up there somewhere."

If I am in some situation where I can't hook up with anyone nor look at porn for many days, then attractive girls that are fully clothed will turn me on just as much as they would naked. But if I am spending days at some nudist beach around many attractive girls, then I'll be more desensitized to girls fully clothed.

metacanada,3aynzk,geeprimus,3,Thu Jun 25 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"OK, agreed. But I guess my point is radicalized Christians don't get the same treatment. Based on your comments though, they should.  Thanks for the insight :-)"
metacanada,3aynzk,lookingatyourcock,4,Thu Jun 25 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"The only thing my radicalization led to was giving away all my stuff, and living without a home for awhile in order to preach. So I needed a Bible to keep me from freaking out about not having food, and stuff like that. Basically, the Bible was needed to suppress common sense. The more extreme you get, the more support you need to stay that way, whether that be from peers, or a book.   Comparing the Bible and Quran as equivalent in terms of likelihood of leading to violence is a pretty complicated and difficult topic to discuss. One way of looking at it though, is that the Quran is a different book to different people. We know that this guy interprets its words to mean something violent. So in his specific case, the book creates more issues than for someone who interprets it to mean something more peaceful. I'd imagine this same process would apply to any book that inspired this type of behavior in a specific person. Similar processes have occurred in the US with the anarchist manifesto."
metacanada,3aynzk,geeprimus,3,Thu Jun 25 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"I guess that's my point. When someone uses the text as an excuse to commit horrific acts of violence, separating them from said text is a proper response. Someone who goes harrasing, attacking, or killing gays in the name of Christianity should get the same treatment. I would hope they would, anyway."

metacanada,3awn4u,TragicLeBronson,2,Wed Jun 24 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"I have a confession everyone: I have a Mincome.  It's true. I'm 100% serious, no sarcasm /s all the way here.  In Ontario, minimum wage is $11, and there are 2080 hours in a working year, so that would make Mincome $22,880. In fact my Mincome is quite a bit higher than that. I do nothing for this money. It goes into my bank account.  I'll repeat myself: I have a Mincome. I do not work for this Mincome. And I think everyone should have a Mincome the way I do.  So the $22,880 question is: how do I have a Mincome?  You can have a Mincome just like me by following these 4 simple steps:   Get a fucking job Save the fucking money you make from the fucking job Invest that fucking money into income yielding investments (ie. dividends, interest, rental income) Sit back and collect your Mincome.   In short: get a fucking job and save your own fucking money, you fucking neckbeards! I did and the dividends thrown out by my portfolio is higher than the Mincome you want to take from me. Fuck you for trying to take my Mincome. Go get your own fucking Mincome. End of True Story (and yes, this is a true story)."

If there are studies or papers on this then I'd be interested in reading them.   I just want to know what that would mean for me as I am basically just entering the workforce. We already support so many services including taking care of the elderly. If we switch over to taking care of EVERYONE then other than myself getting an additional 20 grand, I assume I would be paying that out plus extra for the people I am supporting other than myself.

I was quickly scolded with a wall of text from Majromax on how that really won’t be the case as we’ll still need social workers to set up bank accounts for poor people, for instance.  What I suspect is that mincome boosters don’t just want mincome in place of the welfare state, they want mincome in addition to the welfare state."

metacanada,3awn4u,Beaver_Tears,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think what pisses me off the most about mincome is how it doesn't fucking fit in any societal model at all.  I don't like capitalism because I see it as a system that limits people based on their individual flaws.  Combining peoples different skill sets for a common goal makes for much more effective work and builds a sense of pride and community, but when you start talking about mincome, it breaks down because there's all these whiny entitled pricks leeching off of the hard work of the greater whole.

metacanada,3apyfk,gordonjames62,3,Mon Jun 22 20:06:44 2015 UTC,my general values in my former voting led me to conservative.   Now the CPC has ignored even their supporters.

metacanada,3apyfk,lookingatyourcock,5,Mon Jun 22 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Now the CPC has ignored even their supporters.   What makes you think that? The CPC base has always held around 30% support from eligible voters at minimum, and that has held true in all the polls. Support has spiked up to around 35% numerous times just in the last year. I'm a CPC supporter, and I sure as heck don't feel ignored.   So you're willing to pay higher taxes, accept more bureaucracy, and a less socially conservative government because of C51? The NDP are going to reintroduce a different bill that does similar things as C51, so why do you think the NDP are different in this respect?"

But outside of the elections, they can do as they please without restrictions, from what I understand.   Someone like Stevie T would have a more intimate knowledge,  but to my knowledge the NCC went to court to fight for the free speech to spend whatever they wanted during elections and lost. Harper was actually criticised for going to court to fight for it as director of the NCC but did not revisit it after his rise to power in 2006.  Keep in mind, this is ultimately a free speech issue. Outside of elections we should not be limiting organizations from raising awareness and advocating for their own issues. Elections are a different matter entirely.  People like /r/Canadians are fine with it when it's unions or environmental groups. But when they are evil corporations or conservative, they suddenly see it as an issue.

But outside of the elections, they can do as they please without restrictions, from what I understand.    I agree it is not practical to ban/limit political communication between elections ... I'm specifically asking about activities during the election.  Vote pledging, for example, has paid campaigners contacting electors, identifying the anti-Harper vote, collecting personal information, and then contacting them on election day to remind them of their pledge to vote against Harper.   This is the primary work of political parties during elections, and when political parties do it, it is regulated and spending is limited.  Not so with third parties, it seems.    I'm holding out hope someone here will tell us this is actually illegal for third parties.  But if the left wing PACs are doing this, then HarperPAC needs to do the same."

metacanada,3apjc0,Cole7rain,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:50:42 2015 UTC,They are not even comparable. A good metaphor for interchanges would be to say they are the engines which drive traffic through a city.

metacanada,3apjc0,Cole7rain,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"The metaphor of describing interchanges as engines is just as important as the actual analogy between specific kinds of engines, because regardless of the cost of construction, a cloverleaf at 162nd/Macleod is just as wasteful and useless as buying a F350 for your kitchen remodelling business (insert extremist-hipster small penis jokes here).  Finally since you are one of the 99% who likes to be spoon fed information because you're too good for that reading shit (and apparently also too good to appreciate the metaphors/analogies we peasants use), I fucking googled the cost comparison for you.  It's $5 million for a DD interchange, and $11 million for a cloverleaf.  I suppose next your going to try and dismiss my reasoning because I didn't use a perfect analogy with an engine that only cost twice as much as the other."
metacanada,3apjc0,Ozy_Flame,2,Mon Jun 22 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"Cool, so it is cheaper. We should go for that then, and there should be no debate."
metacanada,3apjc0,Cole7rain,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"I guess if you aren't really familiar with the area then artists rendering wouldn't really help with determining the scale of the thing.

metacanada,3apjc0,Ozy_Flame,2,Mon Jun 22 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"Ok well if we can get the same amount of traffic flow, reduce stop and wait times, reduce the environmental footprint, and pay less in construction costs (including reduced build time), I just can't see why we wouldn't do it.

I did not say that they are equally offensive symbols, that the wearing of them oppresses women equally, nor that women who wear them are forced to do so at the same rate that women are forced to wear the niqab. You have read that in to my statement both times now. What I did say was that both heels and niqabs are in the category of symbols of oppression. I said nothing of magnitude, only order.  The purpose was to reflect on the fact that in our culture, we may disagree with certain things as being misogynistic and symbols of oppression but we don't necessarily legislate them out of existence. If we did, the whole field of women's studies would be relegated to the history departments. We legislate against actions, not symbols. If a woman were being forced to wear anything through threat or violence we understand that to be a crime. We do not treat the action or behaviour that the woman was being coerced into doing as something therefore criminal. In large part, if not entirely because, those actions or behaviours can also be practiced by women who freely choose to do so. This is why the niqab ought not be banned."

He made, and hopefully dropped, an argument against a Quebec judge moving from the federal court to the provincial one after they were no longer eligible for the SCC.

This is currently before the SCC.    His only ""victory"" might be considered the Nadon case   Nah, by far his most famous win was in Baker v Canada. He was on for the applicant. The SCC picked up his argument that he'd made unsuccessfully, so the legend goes, 20 times previously in front of the federal court and federal court of appeal. Turned out to be the singularly most important case in admin law for about 20 years, and still a case that you just can't not know if you practice any type of law. That case made him a real Robert the Bruce figure especially because his client (schizophrenic illegal immigrant single mother) was pretty sympathetic to most of the legal community. He's had big wins before and after Baker but don't make the mistake of underestimating him. He might be nuts but he can probably recite the federal courts act in his sleep"

He also pulled the Nadon reference out of his ass which was no mean feat. We'll see if he wins on Mandville too, though apparently the big difference there is that everybody likes Mandville and nobody liked Nadon (except for Galati himself, oddly enough).  So like you can disagree with him on legal issues or with his role as self-appointed legal batman guy, but he's not an idiot and he's a highly respected senior counsel.

I did see him on tv recently about it and he was saying basically, ""yeah it sounds crazy, but it always sounds crazy right before I win,"" which pretty much sums up Charkaoui and the Nadon reference and Baker.   He's not Clarence Darrow but I'd never call him an idiot like OP. He's incredibly experienced before the fc and fca and has some serious litigation chops.

Thanks for the comment."
metacanada,3akvbl,AkivaAvraham,5,Sun Jun 21 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"In his 1858 campaign in Illinois for the Senate against Stephen Douglas, Lincoln spoke differently depending on the views of his listeners (and also perhaps depending on how close it was to the election). Speaking in northern Illinois in July (in Chicago), he said:   Let us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man, this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position. Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal.    Two months later in Charleston, in southern Illinois, Lincoln told his audience:   I will say, then, that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races (applause); that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people.. . .*  And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race."
metacanada,3akvbl,Pocahontas_Spaceman,2,Sun Jun 21 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"This. The Emancipation Proclomation didn't apply to slaves in states that didn't secede. The Civil War was about the North not letting the South have too much economic power. ""Slavery"" is just how Lincoln co opted to the ati salvery movement to make the war seem just, and how the North used it to whitewash their own war crimes, like burning down Atlanta.  Unfortunately, this fact gets obscured by the 'states rights' idiots who try to pretend the South wasn't fighting to keep slavery. the issue isn't that the South wasn't fighting for slavery (they were), the issue is the North's opposition to it was economic more than it was moral. Yes, there was a strong abolitionist movement in the North, but the powers that be in the north were far more concerned with the economic and therefore political advantages slavery gave the South than they were with the moral issues slavery created."

People who use bots to influence the users on /r/Canada, and other social media sites, obviously have a motive to oppose the Liberals due to support for C-51(Anonymous, for example, has good reason to fear it). So it looks to me like social media and a good chunk of mainstream media will be butting heads."

All I see is the bulk of sentiment switch from jerking for justin to jerking for tom because fuck c51"
metacanada,3aixd9,lookingatyourcock,0,Sun Jun 21 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"Groupthink doesn't explain the direction a circlejerk moves towards. It only explains extremism. By controlling what makes the front page, bots can influence what topics users think about, and how those topics are framed via the headline, and most upvoted comments. They steer the direction of the boat, and let the users do the moving via groupthink.    Of course your typical redditor will care about online privacy and what not. But why were they spending so much time jerking over it, instead of something else?"
metacanada,3aixd9,Pocahontas_Spaceman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Except the groupthink has always opposed c51. What we have seen is the anti C51 jerk and the pro justin jerk butted heads, and the former won. Plus, much of the pro justin jerk was largely just an anti harper jerk. As justin shows his substance (and lackthereof) as we get closer to the election, the harder it is for people to project their 'not harper' onto Justin. But mulcair still has a lot of unkowns about him, so he becomes the best new target for that projection.  basically, c51 is more important to them than everything else. That's not 'bots', and for your theory to work, it would.... be the same 'bots' who once kept justin as the creme de la creme suddenly switched and made it NDP? How would that make sense?  The tide will shift again, most likely back to Justin in a few months, who will likely be seen as the more 'practical' one once the anti C51 cognitive dissonance fades and their outrage wanes."

There will be different people who use bots at different times for various different reasons, and the size of those bots will vary. However, since any bill that improves law enforcements ability to go after cyber crime will likely have a greater impact on people who use bots, it's a bit easier to make an educated guess that those people will use their bots to influence that issue.

However, I'm a bit more careful in arguing all technological advancement is exponential. In some fields it definitely is, but not all. For example, in molecular biology, the ability to sequence DNA has grown at a rate that makes Moore's law look pokey. But the ability to synthesize and build useful constructs has only really grown in a linear fashion (i.e. cloning x # of base pairs per dollar per unit of benchwork time.) Chemists face similar problems in synthesizing compounds. Structural determination is a snap compared to how hard it was 30 years ago, but the actual workflow of designing a synthesis hasn't changed that much. Especially one that is cost effective and works at industrial scales. Even with the advent of combinatorial libraries that robots can screen, the workflow is only marginally accelerated.   I think redditors, who are often from programming or computer hardware backgrounds forget just how different some fields of technology are from their own."

metacanada,3aiulr,inhuman4,11,Sun Jun 21 01:40:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly if I had to choose between a really high minimum wage and mincome I would choose mincome but those are both pretty shitty options...  I think what these neckbeards don't understand is that giving everyone in the country a meaningful amount of money (say $20,000/year) is so outrageously expensive that it's not even worth talking about. I mean that would cost $700 billion, which is two and a half times the total annual expenditures of the Government of Canada.  I would be in favour of having all social safety net payments replaced with a form of mincome but there's so many problems that would need to be worked out to make it worth doing. The biggest in my mind is that you would need to have income reported to the federal government much more frequently than the once a year we do now, say weekly. How do you report income to the government on a weekly basis? Theoretically, if you could find a way to do it you could top up someone's income automatically during events like job loss etc without the trouble of them applying or paying government employees to do it. This could replace all spending not related to payments of programs like welfare, EI, OAS, (like staffing, rental of offices etc) and would be an automatic top up rather than a guaranteed minimum wage."

I'm sure what you mean by income reporting only for those who need it... In my mind you would have to have frequent income reporting for every citizen of Canada so that in the event that someone loses their job the top up would begin automatically, without that person having to apply for it (like EI, which would be gone)."

metacanada,3ahrf7,629guy,17,Sat Jun 20 11:04:15 2015 UTC,"I have so many god damn problems with this type of attitude.  First of all, $125k in Canada is NOT 'rich'.  $125k makes you comfortable enough that you can lease a car with leather seats, own a small house, and eat steak once a week.  You are not living like Donald Trump on $125k/year ANYWHERE in this fucking country.  Second of all, if you're married, your tax rates are based on total household income, not individual income.  This means that we're now lowering the bar for 'rich people who are out of touch with the middle class' to $62.501 each per year.  Is there anyone out there except the most out of touch, delusional liberal in this country who thinks that a married couple each earning $62,500/year is 'out of touch with reality of the Canadian middle class'?  $62.500 is pretty fucking solidly 'middle class' using any metric.    Third, there is NO problem with capitalism, you fucking wanker.  Capitalism works, has worked, and is working just fucking fine, thank you very much.  People making $125k/year are not the problem - liberal twats like /u/SolomonKull very much ARE part of 'the problem'.  These people and their entitlement attitudes are out of fucking control."
metacanada,3ahrf7,MidnightTide,6,Sat Jun 20 08:35:37 2015 UTC,"They are just salivating at the thought of the freebies from the NDP when they tax the shit out of corporations and hard working individuals.  (and this tax increase won't be the last, get your ass ready for some butt rape)"
metacanada,3ahrf7,king_maker_taker,4,Sat Jun 20 14:23:47 2015 UTC,Tax rates are per individual not as a family unit.  That's why income splitting was brought in.
metacanada,3ahrf7,Pocahontas_Spaceman,6,Sat Jun 20 14:48:16 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, and I agree with you, but the issue is more about perspective and pedantics. One person's 'rich' is another person's 'comfortable' or 'upper middle class'.   I think the better point to make to them is that, by their own reasoning, they are 'rich' compared to about 80% of the world's population, too."
metacanada,3ahrf7,AngryMulbear,3,Sat Jun 20 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Apparently being a single guy, who makes over $55k puts me into the Rich category as well."
metacanada,3ahrf7,woodenboatguy,2,Sat Jun 20 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"I generally think you're an asshole texasnorth, but you're right. $62k/year is the minimum one should expect for having an in demand skill set, usually requiring some sort of post-secondary training for a ""typical"" job that is more that starting level service industry. We're talking accountants, tradesmen, teachers, nurses, technicians in labs, mechanics etc. You know, the sort of jobs that the middle class used to stereotypically be described as having in the past.  Comments like the OP you linked shows you just how filled reddit is with whiny early 20-something ""liberals"" that are really just jealous of anyone who somewhat has their shit together. $62.5k/year gross is very doable even for the hard done by Millennials."

metacanada,3ahrf7,Kestyr,5,Sat Jun 20 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"Porsche's aren't even that expensive. Affordable Sports cars as far as high end ones go. $60k-100k new, you can find that way cheaper used and only a couple of years old."
metacanada,3ahrf7,PECOTA,2,Sat Jun 20 18:36:35 2015 UTC,"If I wanted something from the 70s that was cheap, flashy and unreliable I'd hire Justin Trudeau"
metacanada,3ahrf7,Beaver_Tears,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:00:59 2015 UTC,"62k sounds like a lot of money when you are a single person just out of university with no real expenses beyond your cell phone bill and you realize you just spent 4 years farting around at uni, studying ""what you love"" instead of ""what is useful"" and now have that much student debt.  while i may be a loony leftnut, i agree that the sense of entitlement in this country is completely out of control, but simply because if you never bothered to spend your school years doing or finding something useful, you have failed your country, comerade, and the state doesn't owe you shit.  raising the taxes on the rich is only okay if it's going into infrastructure, health care and education"
metacanada,3ahrf7,Pocahontas_Spaceman,10,Sun Jun 21 01:23:51 2015 UTC,"This, I believe, is the fundamental flaw with (or at least a significant downside of) a strong middle class and social safety net. It seems to inevitably breed children who are, with each passing generation, increasingly insufferable and entitled twits.  Frankly, maybe this is why prosperous cultures need to war, so they can keep thinning out their new generations who would otherwise end up smugging up the place."

metacanada,3ahrf7,Kestyr,4,Sat Jun 20 21:25:15 2015 UTC,125k a year might be rich in the fucking middle of nowhere. Try to talk big with that money in any 100k+person city and you'll get bad news.
metacanada,3ahrf7,snstrsnctyslckr,8,Sat Jun 20 23:31:52 2015 UTC,Do you spend too much time in an echo chamber? Then you're probably out of touch with Canadian values.
metacanada,3ahrf7,lookingatyourcock,8,Sat Jun 20 13:08:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you guys are arguing over the definition of rich. It's a pretty subjective word. The problem with what he is saying has more to do with the idea of income determining whether you're in touch with Canadian values. And ""Canadian values"" being a loaded term that isn't defined."

I remember watching a documentary titled ""Capitalism in Africa"" or something along those lines, as these truckers tried to do business across a bunch of bureaucratic backwater countries, including Tanzania which is constitutionally a socialist state.

metacanada,3agk7k,lookingatyourcock,6,Sat Jun 20 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"Seems like every time I hear someone use the word fearmongering, there is a shit ton of hyperbole along with it to make it seem like a catastrophe is about to happen.

The original phone I started the plan with (Samsung Galaxy S3) died, so I bought a Nexus 5 ($300 eBay) and it has been great.  My three year contract is running out and they called me and offered me a new phone and two year plans for more than double what I am paying now.  I declined, and I get to keep my rate minus the dead phone I'm still paying off. So under $50.00 / month for unlimited everything and 5gb data.  I'm lucky, this is rare.

Same thing goes for Senate reform: Harper was all about Triple-E until the SCC pissed on his shoes and he had the opportunity to shove some Conservative appointments into the Senate.  The thing that worries me is that the NDP might actually be serious about this shit. I don't want PR, and I don't want the Senate to be abolished. I wasn't really bothered by the prospect of an NDP majority until they made the foregoing a part of their campaign.  Also, it bothers me that they continue to assert that they can mess with our electoral system and flush the Senate down the crapper without touching our Constitution.

This is an example of the system working the way it was intended.   Even if Harper is doing something he doesn't really want, it doesn't matter.

The shit flinging was fair game. He loved attention, and went out of his way to get it. That's why his political opinions were so extreme. He is certainly useful to have around though, and is probably keeping a slightly lower profile with some alt.   IMO people here are/were taking the suicide threat way too seriously. No one encouraged him to kill himself, and no one harassed him. For there to be harassment, he would have had to indicate that he didn't want to engage with us, and then maintain that intent over a period of time.   And what if he simply stopped using reddit forever, and no one heard from him again. Should we freak out over that? I would wager a no. But what if we were to learn that he did kill himself. Some people here will probably freak out. But why? There is no difference between the two scenarios I just described. What concern are his future personal choices to us? We are not psychologists.

Let's get real here - for most people it is a recreational activity, not a form of personal or commercial transportation comparable to owning a vehicle and most people are not interested in following traffic laws while cycling.

The article didn't mention that 39% is their statutory tax rate, not the effective tax rate, which is what would actually be important when determining our competitiveness against the US.  Basically, he's falsely implying (or possibly even thinks himself) that we really do have that much room to raise taxes while still being competitive.  Not to mention that there's plenty of evidence that raising corp. taxes at all will still leave us with less rather than more money.   He said an NDP government would keep corporate taxes below the American rate and “we’ll also wind up below the OECD average. But we’re so far below both right now it doesn’t make any sense.”  In fact, Canada’s tax rate is already slightly above the average 26.0 per cent imposed by the 34 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Since that interview, Mulcair hasn’t mentioned the OECD and has talked instead about bringing Canada’s corporate tax rate more in line with the average of G7 industrialized countries.   What a fucking goofball.  We are not just competing with the G7, this is a ridiculously arbitrary group to focus on because the rest of the OECD will just as happily take our companies whether they're part of the G7 or not.   Which tax bar Mulcair really intends to limbo under makes a huge difference, since he’s relying on the promised corporate tax hike to rake in much of the revenue he’ll need to pay for child care and other pricey promises.   And this is where people need to start worrying.   There is a lot of evidence that indicates higher corporate taxes result in LESS government revenue.  He's basically assuming his tax increases will pay for his pledged increases in spending, but what happens if we end up with even less money?  Who's paying for those promises now?"

metacanada,3a7wwh,barosa,8,Thu Jun 18 01:14:44 2015 UTC,Voat is reddit without the shitty redditors
metacanada,3a7wwh,lookingatyourcock,7,Thu Jun 18 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"Voat is all of the redditors who hate reddit, and not much more."
metacanada,3a7wwh,barosa,5,Thu Jun 18 02:31:48 2015 UTC,Don't we sort of hate reddit in a way?
metacanada,3a7wwh,lookingatyourcock,8,Thu Jun 18 02:32:52 2015 UTC,"I only hate it for eating up too much of my time.   There's not even close to another forum this size where you can say what you actually want, as long as the mods allow it. The admins might go a little overboard with censorship a little bit now and then, but I prefer to side with losing some subreddits over having absolutely no rules against doxxing or IRL harassment like on voat. Really it's just about as good as it could be, at least for now.   If there's a mass exodus to voat, I won't be joining it."
metacanada,3a7wwh,barosa,3,Thu Jun 18 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"That applies pressure to avoid saying things that could reveal your identity. So, less personal shit in general, which has advantages. Doxxing can also be avoided somewhat by making truthful personal statements when it matters, and when it doesn't matter, making false contradictory comments about yourself in other conversations. Or within one personal story, altering or adding minor false details that aren't important."
metacanada,3a7wwh,barosa,4,Thu Jun 18 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly care one way or the other at the end of the day but I do for now find the ""front page"" community to be far more palatable over there."
metacanada,3a7wwh,Pocahontas_Spaceman,7,Thu Jun 18 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"Well, once it gets to a certain size, it's going to go to shit no matter what. That goes for individual subreddits and for the frontpage community. I don't think there's enough that's fundamentally different with voat to protect against hordes of stupid kids flooding it with stupid shit eventually. If anything, the lack of admins will make problems worse, and if it ever gets big, spamming will be a huge problem because reddit's spent a decade working on training their spam filters.   I mostly just hang around in subs that interest me and occasionally check the frontpage links to see what's going on."
metacanada,3a7wwh,Pocahontas_Spaceman,3,Thu Jun 18 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"Spamming is still a big issue here though, and those spam filters are pretty weak. I mean look at /r/Politics. The spammers have been so successful that they actually made a post to brag about their effort to use reddit to get the Bernie Sanders campaign off the ground.   I've already been on voat since its inception, although haven't used it much. I'd use it more if it grows because I want to know what the popular narratives are from various social media platforms, because I believe social media has a significant influence on political pressures which leak into the mainstream. The Arab spring is an example of just how large of an impact social media can have. I'd rather not stick my head in the sand and pretend the ugly parts don't exist."
metacanada,3a7wwh,Pocahontas_Spaceman,2,Thu Jun 18 13:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah spamming will be an issue forever, because there's huge incentive to get around the filters. Reddit's big efforts at least keep out the low-effort spam. If voat got big enough to attract significant spam, it would be a giant mess without an active admin team actively removing the shit, at which point it would again be similar to reddit.  In terms of social media in general, the thing with voat is that it's not doing anything original whatsoever. It's basically an exact replica of reddit, except that they're not removing anything, at least for now because they have no advertisers to worry about appeasing. Yeah they have slightly different settings for voting (requiring some upvoted comments before being able to downvote), but all of that will go to shit and not mean anything if they're not properly enforcing alt account abuse, which is another thing reddit's sunk a huge amount of time and effort into preventing.   But also, reddit doesn't remove THAT much. It's definitely still a great place to follow active news stories, and the live feed thing is where I spend most of my time when news is breaking. I personally don't feel like my freedom of speech is being taken away by the admins. I'm very much against doxxing in any form, because I don't think anyone should have to worry about being stalked or harassed IRL because of what they post on an anonymous forum or even another website."
metacanada,3a7wwh,Pocahontas_Spaceman,2,Thu Jun 18 14:05:05 2015 UTC,That's true too I guess. I'm the same way for browsing. I seem to remember reddit having much less stupid bullshit in front page comments just three years ago though. Maybe it really has grown more than I think.

metacanada,3a6mn9,lookingatyourcock,2,Thu Jun 18 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"old admins used to talk about issues like this openly.  then their talk went to private 'mod' subs... then, as far as i know, it died.  at the same time, last time i was moderating subs i got a more or less fu from admins names i didn't know... so, my volunteer work on reddit is now passed on to the french."
metacanada,3a6mn9,c74,3,Thu Jun 18 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"The admins have also mentioned that voting bots are an issue all over reddit, even in small subs.    I would very much like for /r/metacanada to have a more serious discussion about the possibility that /r/canada is presently the target of vote manipulation. I don""t normally go in for this kind of conspiratorial stuff, but there's something very fishy about the political content on /r/canada lately.  It's all conjecture, and I concede that the most likely explanation is that /r/canada really is credulous and ignorant enough to collectively provide uncritical and unmitigated support of the NDP. However, I can't help feeling that somebody is throwing a little circlejerk-enhancing assistance in there."
metacanada,3a6mn9,SmugBlunderer,3,Thu Jun 18 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"you could write a script that would constantly sample every incoming sub to /r/canada every minute or so, you would have to look for systematic patterns, like subs that are pro a certain party being upvoted exactly 4 times within the first minute of being submitted (4 is just an example number, it could be anything).  i believe this was how they caught a certain web-hosting service upvoting images hosted on their own domain and downvoting others on /r/adviceanimals a while back."
metacanada,3a6mn9,Beaver_Tears,3,Thu Jun 18 03:03:04 2015 UTC,I think you are giving the NDP too much credit to pull off something like that. They still use paper for door canvassing.
metacanada,3a6mn9,jtbc,3,Thu Jun 18 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"If there are successful NDP bots I'd imagine that it would either be from a supporter acting alone, or several supporters acting alone whose combination of small bots end up dominating. Or an effort from a Canadian organization such as a union or something, or foreign state or organization that would benefit. But I am not aware of anyway that this could be verified. Plus there are more than likely multiple small bots competing against each other, while only being active for short periods of time before getting caught. Moreover, as Unidan had shown, you don't even need scripts. He had a lot of success from just manually controlling 5 accounts to upvote his stuff, and downvote others. Early votes are given much more weight."
metacanada,3a6mn9,lookingatyourcock,3,Thu Jun 18 06:09:47 2015 UTC,"That is interesting. I mostly know about unidan due to our mutual interest in jackdaws, but I am also quite interested in the use and abuse of reddit by political parties, special interest groups, and the media. Even if reddit is mostly lonely neckbeards drinking mountain dew in basements, there is just too much juicy, juicy content and data here for those other folks to ignore."
metacanada,3a6mn9,jtbc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:22:21 2015 UTC,"Its not necessarily ""the ndp"", it could be rogue supporters of any party"
metacanada,3a6mn9,Beaver_Tears,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:16:27 2015 UTC,At least one of those other parties probably does have the resources and know-how to pull it off.
metacanada,3a6mn9,jtbc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Another thing I just thought of, is that the type of people who use bots probably have a lot more to lose from bills like C-51. So any policy which helps law enforcement track down cyber crime, or reduces privacy online, would probably unify the efforts of most of the bots."
metacanada,3a6mn9,lookingatyourcock,2,Thu Jun 18 17:39:37 2015 UTC,I think you've got it. /r/Canada is being manipulated by anonymous. It makes so much sense now. They even pull from the same demographic.
metacanada,3a6mn9,jtbc,2,Thu Jun 18 17:52:16 2015 UTC,"Reddit has a time delay before showing vote scores, and the delay time always changes. The admins have access to more data that makes it easier to detect stuff like this though. So we as users have very limited options. Plus, going into too much detail about these mechanisms can result in a shadowban, as the admins obviously don't want people talking about how to evade these security features."
metacanada,3a6mn9,lookingatyourcock,3,Thu Jun 18 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"The admins are the only ones with enough information to fully investigate stuff like that. However, I'm in the process of collecting general stats from the admins, and familiarizing myself with reddits API. Once I have a grasp on the API, I'll see if I can quantify the post and comment narratives, then use that to find patterns in how it changes over time. I'll be making meta off posts with those results in the future, which should facilitate a more useful discussion about potential influences like that."

In February when I got laid off there was very little for opportunities at companies and it's been getting progressively worse.  Picked the worst time to come out to this place.  I am actually making less money than at my last job and am hoping new postings open up sooner than later as if thy don't I'm going to join the army as at least as they will handle my schooling and when I get out I'd have more trade certifications.

Right from the get go he was attacked by the bitter, downtown losers. Even on simple things that he campaigned on, such as contracting out a portion of garbage pick-up  It may be that the Alberta NDP fuck things up, but I think they should be given at least a year before every little thing they do is picked apart to death by the losers.   The NDP were huge winners in Alberta. If them hiring anti resource extraction people from Toronto, or raising taxes and royalties ultimately set back Alberta, then the NDP will be kicked to the curb just like they were in Ontario.  Furthermore, how can anybody even fault the Alberta NDP? They are only where they are because of the arrogance and incompetence of the Alberta PCs and Wild Rose."

metacanada,3a3ruw,PatMartinsAlcoholism,4,Wed Jun 17 08:34:24 2015 UTC,Classic Liberalism is the opposite of economic responsibility. It's laissez-fair policies that essentially de-regulate everything. Classical Liberalism is essentially neoliberalism.
metacanada,3a3ruw,Tenaciousceeee,3,Wed Jun 17 05:35:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your criticism. I'll try to be brief:   It's laissez-fair policies that essentially de-regulate everything.   Lessaiz faire except in the realm of protecting property rights and upholding contracts, which means that there are regulatory mechanisms that need to be put in place to protect against fraud.  So for example; Wearing a seatbelt should be a regulation because if you kill yourself while causing an accident, the damages that you are liable for are not able to be paid.   Or when I buy bread; the ingredients need to be placed upon the package, and irregularities need to be marked clearly. Otherwise this is a form of Fraud.  But regulating that no private hospitals are allowed to exist, or that they are only allowed to hire certain doctors, or forcing businesses to buy from Canadian Companies instead of foreign competitors, or subsidizing growing wheat, or wage and price controls... These are all unnecessary barriers to economic activity that the market can address anyways, and in the worst cases lead to growth in corruption through greased palms and the like.  What do you think?"
metacanada,3a3ruw,AkivaAvraham,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:27:36 2015 UTC,"When laissez-fair economics was developed as a theory, the distribution of labour was balanced. Automation and industrialization was in its infancy, putting a cap on production. Laissez-Fair policies worked under the fundamental premise of owning your labour. If I make horseshoes, I can trade those horseshoes for other services to improve my quality of life.  As we ramped up production, that labour distribution model became lopsided and workers no longer controlled their own labour, they became a resource. Machines were doing the work of 5 men/children. With exploitation becoming rampant as there seemed to be a glut of workers and not enough work, labour laws began to sprout up as workers began to demand more money.   This isn't socialist thinking, it's a matter of promoting growth and economic stability. Having people working is the greatest benefit to society as it keeps us busy. Societies are much more stable when its citizens are productive and working.  Laissez-fair economics throw out wage benchmarks under the auspicious of economic growth and what it does is allow those who own the means of production is to chase down the cheapest labour possible, creating the same economic imbalances that produced Marxism.  Henry Ford knew this and paid his workers a salary that would afford them the financial ability to buy one of the cars that they build.  Although I do believe in free-market thinking, labor benchmarks should be a standard across all the great economies and if you want to have access to these markets., Corporations need to live up to commitments to ensure that staff are paid first world wages. They created rules for the means of production to ensure fairness.  Allowing companies to move to Mexico because they can pay workers 1/10th of the salary than other countries is ridiculous because their revenues aren't going to change. We were all sold that NAFTA was going to bring labour parity to North America and as predicted, it's doing the complete opposite."
metacanada,3a3ruw,Tenaciousceeee,0,Wed Jun 17 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to respond at length.   As we ramped up production, that labour distribution model became lopsided and workers no longer controlled their own labour, they became a resource. Machines were doing the work of 5 men/children. With exploitation becoming rampant as there seemed to be a glut of workers and not enough work, labour laws began to sprout up as workers began to demand more money.    You are right that some work did become sparse; The lightbulb put candle workers out of business, but you are doing a disservice to everyone if you regulate that the Candle making industry should be perpetuated for the sake of the candle maker who does not wish to reskill himself.   This isn't socialist thinking, it's a matter of promoting growth and economic stability. Having people working is the greatest benefit to society as it keeps us busy. Societies are much more stable when its citizens are productive and working.   And the most stable societies are those which trend towards greater economic freedom. Then indexes of economic freedoms show this well.    Laissez-fair economics throw out wage benchmarks under the auspicious of economic growth and what it does is allow those who own the means of production is to chase down the cheapest labour possible, creating the same economic imbalances that produced Marxism.   Marxism was produced via a creative interpretation of the Labour theory of value. However; Lenin recognized that Marx was fundamentally mistaken in his prediction that the working class would become more impoverished, rather seeing that their wealth had increased.    Henry Ford knew this and paid his workers a salary that would afford them the financial ability to buy one of the cars that they build.   What made Ford wealthy was the Assembly Line innovation, and by providing value to his employees. Yes he paid his employees a lot of dough, but that in itself is not a metric for success, but only for guaranteeing a high quality staff.   Allowing companies to move to Mexico because they can pay workers 1/10th of the salary than other countries is ridiculous because their revenues aren't going to change. We were all sold that NAFTA was going to bring labour parity to North America and as predicted, it's doing the complete opposite.   We wouldn't be able to do this if Mexico simply had greater economic freedom, instead of their backward and corrupt bureaucratic economy.

Is it so much of a damn crime to ask them to meet a certain level before actually starting to their job?   But, you are playing loose with the standard, Trudeau said ""bilingual"" which is a far sight stronger than ""basics of the French language"".   Ever interacted with a 'bilingual' civil servant? The standard is fairly loose.   As well, why do we allow a linguistic minority to counter weight all other factors? French is a minority language in Canada, but all Judges must be fluent to be a Supreme Justice?    Every time I see a comment like that I wonder where the hell were you people in 1995? If people don't want to assume the responsibility of being a bilingual state then either adopt an assimilation policy or kick out the linguistic minority.

Get your shit together Justin, and don't forget to disclose how taxpayers paid for you to travel on paid speaking tours.   Greater civilian access to government information   Better than ""if you ask for it, and it is not protected information, you'll get it"".  OK then.   Register people to vote in high school   High school students can't vote, you fucking nitwit.   Mandatory voting and proportional representation   It is a free country, and if I don't want to vote, then that is my democratic choice.  As for PR, I prefer my MP has at least a plurality of support in the constituency he represents.  I can see how that might be an issue for Liberals, tho.   Repeal citizen voting act and parts of the fair election act   All those changes improve the quality of Canadian democracy. Repealing it is a step backward.   Increased funding for elections Canada to reduce voter fraud   Elections Canada is a regulated entity under the Elections Act, and there are sections of the Act that apply only to Elections Canada, for example around the frequent leaks to the media.  It is a conflict of interest for Elections Canada to be in a position to investigate itself, that is why the Commissioner of Elections conducts investigations.  Trudeau would put the fox in charge of the henhouse.   Ban government partisan ads   Partisan ads are already illegal, Justin you nitwit.  The government ads are not partisan, even if you REALLY want that talking point.  Trudeau will try anything to get the government to shut up about its policies.  Fucking coward can't speak directly to the policies, so better just make all government communication illegal.   Ban political ads before the election period   ... but only from political parties.  That way the Liberal Party outrider groups and shills can pound away at the Liberal Party message, whithout limit, and without Justin ever taking responsibility for the lies he creates an perpetuates.  Also, why does Trudeau want to muzzle political discourse?   Only allow leader debates approved by a special commission to ensure it's conducted in a manner that encourages knowledge   Fuck ""special commissions"", they are unelected and deserve zero power in a democracy.  There is nothing wrong with political parties deciding where when and how they debate, in fact there are no other organizations that can be better held to account for their decisions.    Provincial borrowing plans must be pre-approved by parliament   Meet the Constitution, Trudeau you pathetic excuse for a national leader.   Increased funding for parliamentary committees   Why?  Aren't they wasting enough money already?   More free votes for MPs   Go for it Justin.  Why don't you start with abortion, same sex marriage, capital punishment, et cetera ad nausium.   Don't abolish the senate   Or, if it is Tuesday, DO abolish the Senate!  But whatever you do, don't worry about the Supreme Court ruling, the Constitution, or the provinces, tho.   Supreme court justices must be bilingual  Introduce a PM's question period, and give the speaker more powers   Micheal Chong had a good idea, Trudeau stole it.   more parliamentary oversight of CSIS and RCMP   Politicians have no business overseeing security forces, that can only lead to bad things.  They already have the power to review, not oversee.  Trudeau is so ignorant he doesn't even understand the distinction.   More funding for government auditing/oversight groups  End the practice of omnibus bills   Until the first budget, which could not ever logistically be broken into separate bills.  Instead of bitching about omnibus bills, why doesn't Justin try doing his job as opposition and read the fucking legislation.   Door-to-door delivery from the canada post   Two thirds of Canadians are doing just fine without this throwback from the 19th and 20th centuries.    The cabinet will be 50% men and 50% women at all times   Sexist pig.   Create a council of 16-24 year olds to advise the PM on youth issues   What could go wrong?   Study how government policies affect gender   Fuck gender politics, we're all equal.   Have all government services accessible from one web site   So, like Service Canada, then?   CRA overhaul. The CRA will complete tax returns for certain people, and will notify you of tax benefits you missed.    Can CRA also wipe my ass for me?   Bring back the long-form census   1) It is a survey, always was a survey 2) the long-form has not gone anywhere 3) coercing responses leads to bad data from Jedi Knights.   For autonomy for government scientists   If scientists want autonomy from the government, they should not work for the government.

They have a soft-on-crime stance, but they live in gated, private communities where there is no threat of crime.  They tell people to ride bikes and use public transportation to reduce oil consumption, while themselves traveling around the world in private jets and rented luxury SUVs.  They join organizations like PETA because they believe that killing animals is wrong, but they wear expensive leather belts and shoes.    Limousine liberal is mostly an American term. In Austrialia, an equivalent term is ""chardonnay socialist"", while in France the equivalent term is gauche caviar (caviar left)."

metacanada,39y9ub,MidnightTide,9,Mon Jun 15 22:35:08 2015 UTC,I absolutely cannot stand the teachers unions. The vehemently attack any party that does not bend over backwards for them.  Bill 115 to stop teachers from striking again? The Liberals are evil!  Hudak wants to atrophy unnecessary public sector jobs (which does not include the education sector)? Run ads against this evil man! Vote for Liberals!  Liberals are in power and are not giving into to their contract demands? Better start a Work-to-Rule campaign.  It seems like every year some teachers union is either on strike or talking about job action. And it's never during their 2 months off in the summer.

Unions, pay, promotions, pension, sick leave, health care, and curriculum-related issues (marking, tutoring, etc.) are all that matters to them.

The teach some after school thing or coach a team. And they go home and start it all over. They are banking gold-plated pensions. Not to mention if you have ever seen the BB system that most school boards have set-up, it is a giant community of teachers who sell stuff and swap stories, it's all very touching really.  We can go further...they are the only profession who does not seem to understand their own job decription. They think that they know what is best for your children (regardless of the fact that what is taught in school is purely political in nature and we have advocates that we pay for that called elected representatives).  And the icing on the cake? They probably could not get into law school, couldn't do anything with that history sociology combo degree and so became a teacher. Some of my dumbest friends are now grade school and high school teachers. And I when I mean dumb I mean like /r/Canada level dumb. And these people feed you children shit all day long. I remember in grade 4 we had to write a letter to an important person, me being the political junkie that I was (even at that age) wrote a letter to Mike Harris. In the letter I explained how I thought he was doing good for the province, etc etc. My teacher refused to send the letter unless I changed it to not talk about how good he was but just to tell him what I was up to in school. I was still young so I could not muster up or know any better in order to defend myself."

With that in mind, the NDA,   QR&Os,  and other supporting acts and regulations dictate behaviors of CF service members in that kind of context.  I would very comfortably say that he has not crossed the line of political activity on reddit. He has not aimed to leverage his position,  as a member, to influence others to support a given party.  There is, however, activity prescribed in the QR&Os which stipulate that members should not do anything that would cause harm/disrepute to fall upon the government or a superior. It's in their somewhere.   Another member here can corrected my information though. It is all moot though, considering reddit is anonymous, right? Right?  Palpz would be far from the worse offender.

metacanada,39ximu,Stinky-pickle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:53:41 2015 UTC,"Well the military justice system is an interesting beast. Chances are you were charged and sent to a summary trial which the old saying was ""march the guilty bastard."" In that instance you are best to just take the licking, especially if you are willing to admit to guilt. Now for more serious offenses you either go directly to civilian court (you will have a lawyer), court martial (you will have a lawyer) or a chance to elect for court martial or summary trial."

metacanada,39ximu,go_west,2,Tue Jun 16 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Good. That should hopefully cause it to lose more legitimacy. Plus, lots of people(any given sub has way more casual lurkers than commentors and comment voters) judge how right or wrong an argument is by the amount of upvotes or downvotes it has. So if it isn't possible for the place to reach any balance, then anyone submitting an opposing argument will cause those lurkers to associate that specific argument as wrong. If the opposing arguments are never presented in that environment, then they stand a better chance of being considered in some other context outside of that subreddit. Since the hivemind usually only attacks stawmen, the real opposing arguments avoid being tainted.   Edit: This entire comment is about moderate and casual lurkers that we never see, but make up a huge portion of page views. I know that people who are engaged and active in the subreddit can overlook vote counts(although probably not as much as they think), but those people are a tiny minority which, relatively speaking, don't matter. Moreover, most of that minority isn't likely to change their mind about anything anyways. Although the dynamic is probably a lot different between LPC and NDP supporters."

This was after my comment about being sorry that Canadians have to deal with self-entitled and politically motivated teachers across the country. Apparently playing on her words and apologizing for the whole country is against one of their rules.  I have removed myself from that sub from now on.

They cause havoc. All sorts of havoc. One of them being, they can cause surges, or if bad enough, a localized emp. and again, that would not destroy a digitized file. As others have shown you in this thread, they aren't stored on a single hard drive. This entire conversation... If we can even call it that, at this point, has been confused by you, because you have the reading comprehension of a 6th grader. Good enough to get by, but then we run into problems like these, where you can't follow a sentence well enough to comprehend that i was talking about how the one thing, can lead to another happening. It's supposed to be pretty simple to understand, but then i guess you definitely proved me wrong on that one. Ooooo name calling....we're getting closer! But that's about all i have been wrong about in this. Oh, that and the raid and UPS thing some other fellow pointed out. But otherwise, you are just a fucking dumbass. Almost there.... Now fuck off, and go bother someone else who gives a fuck over whether or not you live. Quite frankly, i fucking hate you. Your a piece of shit scum and if somehow the news were to have your epitaph in it tomorrow, i actually wouldn't give a fuck about how you died. I would probably frame the picture. LOL permalink   [-]Crowned_Son_of_Fire-1 points  and again, that would not destroy a digitized file. Not destroy the file. Destroy the fucking device holding the file you inconceivable fucking retard. The device, aka a harddrive, would not work anymore, rendering the file inaccessible. It might as well be gone at that point. I don't how much more simple i can make this for you. If you still don't understand, you are on a whole new level of stupid. permalink   [-]el_notario2 points  Not destroy the file.

You've been told that by several users, yet you still seem to want to cling to that idea. Also you shouldn't use the R word as a progressive NDP supporter.

Not very socially friendly of you. are you sure you aren't a CPCer in disguise? permalink   [-]Crowned_Son_of_Fire-2 points  and for the 10000th time, they aren't stored on a single hard drive. You've been told that by several users, yet you still seem to want to cling to that idea. Oh, have i? I haven't seen any of these Several, or 10000 times of being told at all. In fact, only 1 other person has had anything to say to me about this other than you. I have to go check again, but i am pretty sure he said that using Raid is kind of pointless today. By the way, Raid is using multiple hard drives to store the same file. As for the NDP bullshit. I only support whoever has the best chance to get your glorious leader out of power. If the weapon must be Mulcair and his beard, then so be it. As for using words. I don't give a shit about using the word Retard. As it means slow in our other language. Are you saying i shouldn't be calling you slow? You seem slow, so i think it fits perfectly. No, i think you just don't like me using french words to call you what you are. Dumb, and slow. I think the polish have a perfect word for you. It's Dumkopf. Not sure if i spelled that right though. If you see an edit here, it's because i had to fix my spelling.

I guess you are good for something after all. permalink   [-]el_notarioundefined points  [deleted comment restored by uneddit.com] If my grade 6 reading comprehension is correcting your sub-par language skills, does that mean you write at a less than grade 6 level? That's sort of sad. I knew our education system needed help, but sheesh! didn't think it was that bad. Good night! Sleep tight! Don't let the bed bugs bite! (see I care about you, embrace me. You know you want it.) permalink   [-]Crowned_Son_of_Fireundefined points  [deleted comment restored by uneddit.com] No. I just accidentally used the wrong you're. A common mistake. Even expert orators and even English teachers make the mistake now and then. If they, the people who ought to know much more than us about language, can make that mistake, then i think me making that small mistake can be forgiven too. You completely misunderstanding and even confusing what i wrote though. That, is sad. A simple spelling mistake or grammatical error is one thing. But illiteracy should have been done away with a long time ago. SO i guess you are right about one thing. Our education system needs some help. It produced you. As for caring. No bed bugs here, but thanks for the concern. Seeing as how you keep to that old saying, i would assume that you do have to deal with bed bugs. You should get that dealt with. They are hazardous to your health. (See i care too, but not as much as you might think. As long as you're still alive, i wouldn't want your life to be too miserable. You already must be miserable enough as it is, what with being so bloody dumb and all.) permalink"

metacanada,39qn4j,2bobk,5,Sat Jun 13 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"This comment is laughable at best.   You're on the right track with the whole basic income thing. When I think of that further, here's what I see:  • Artists who aren't stifled by the need to keep low-income jobs in order to survive until they ""make it"" -- and whose art is held back by that need (try being creative after working a full shift at Walmart...)  • When people don't have to get a full-time job, the lazier ones won't bother, leaving more jobs for the hard workers. That means all the retail and customer service jobs will suddenly be filled by people who might give more of a shit and want to help you.  • When people don't have to get a job, more people will consider part-time work, rather than full-time, leaving more time to raise children (properly, one would hope, just by being there for them more of the time.) That allows more people to get jobs (when they want it) without being forced into the grind of 40+ hour weeks.   • People with more free time will need more activities to fill their time, and guess what, most activities end up costing money, creating more jobs, and making more money for the providers of these activities (so the capitalists who are horrified at the idea of giving people money for nothing need to take a step back and realize they can actually make more money if the people ""at the bottom"" have more money to spend.)  • Since a lot of people will only work to supplement their basic income, they'll get a little more choosy about what jobs they actually want to do. Fewer people will accept the idea that $10/h is worth their time, and employers will have to start offering more, without the need to raise the minimum wage. The minimum wage can remain low for part-time jobs for unskilled teenagers and such, while people who have to support their families won't be forced into those more menial and underpaid jobs.  • Those right-wing people who want a smaller government should rejoice at the idea that we can cut all those welfare inspector jobs, and a lot of specific social programs that cost a lot to administer, and replace it all with a basic income which every adult citizen can receive, and live off of (with all the basics covered, but no more) without the need to request it. If you make enough money and don't need that basic income, you can return it to the government, who can invest it and share the profits with you 50-50 (or something like that) with the government's share going towards improving life for all citizens. Or, you can invest it yourself, and depending on the type of investment, pay less income tax on that particular amount, if the investment is deemed to be worthwhile to the country in general. Or, put it in a private Employment Insurance fund, that you can dip into if you ever lose your job and need some supplemental money to keep your train of life going while looking for another job.  You would ask, where does the money come from? Well, people would have to start paying income tax on any money they make above that basic income, with the brackets and such adjusted to bring in about as much money as right now. We wouldn't need that much more money, because of all the savings from removing all the welfare inspector jobs, and all the social program administration jobs.  And with just about everyone making enough to live by, crime will probably go down (it won't go away completely, but a certain class of crime that is caused by poverty will certainly be reduced significantly) to the point where we may need fewer policemen and such.  And all it takes is for people to get out of the mentality of ""not wanting their income tax to pay for the lazy people"", when the real problem is the super-rich living off of and leeching the rest of the population dry while producing very little that's worthwhile in return."

Meta off:  I hear this all the time, but what about artists that never ""make it""? If you can't make a living off of making art, why don't you just accept that art is a hobby and not a career for most people?

It's not hard to see why the whiny mincome crowd is against it.  However, the only thing I hate more than people whining about tipping is ""mandatory gratuities"", at least call it a commission at that point."
metacanada,39pqj7,lookingatyourcock,2,Sat Jun 13 18:53:16 2015 UTC,"""mandatory gratuities"", at least call it a commission at that point.   That's exactly it. I like tipping. Heck, I tip all the time on reddit by gilding comments. But the ""tipping"" culture we have where a certain percentage is expected for doing the minimum isn't really about tipping anymore."
metacanada,39pqj7,rawmeatdisco,2,Sat Jun 13 20:01:43 2015 UTC,Why do people hate tipping so much? If you do away with tipping then the cost of the meal goes up. Restaurants cost a lot of money to operate and doing away with tipping doesn't change that.    This guy has been doing this for two months now and is using made up numbers. Its hardly something to celebrate.

metacanada,39pqj7,lookingatyourcock,3,Sat Jun 13 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"then the cost of the meal goes up.    Would it really be harder to hire a server for a similar price as, say, a cashier at a grocery store(assuming the entire tipping culture stopped)? Plus it makes no sense to tip by percentage of the meal cost, which the server doesn't even make, and isn't a good reflection on how much work they put in. I don't think it would have much impact, if any, on meal price. And even if it did, it would be more convenient to have it worked into the meal price. Plus, I'd rather servers just focus on doing their job, rather than suck up and get all chatty for tips. I'd prefer tipping to be more rare, so that it isn't something expected just for doing the bare minimum."
metacanada,39pqj7,Pocahontas_Spaceman,2,Sat Jun 13 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Tipping is antiquated, but it's how restaurant owners offset their costs to a public who would otherwise balk at paying the full cost of the meal they buy.

If the government has a policy or platform stance that you don't, you attack it; if it's something that your party doesn't oppose, you either ignore it or repudiate the government's ability to handle it competently.  That said, I'm leaning toward the NDP myself: while I strongly oppose their position on the Senate, I'm frustrated enough with the CPC to seriously consider an alternative.

And the fact that some of them can do math and shit better while high isn't proof that it isn't harmful over the long term.

She has the right to make the wrong decision on policy, then the media can complain, and the other parties can make it an election issue.

There's no review of their decisions and when they cloth a policy choice (as I'm saying this one is) in the Charter it takes away Parliament's ability to create policies on certain issues (even though they can, at any point, change their minds about what's constitutional and what isnt.)  Plus. They're not all that good looking either."
metacanada,39hgv4,Pocahontas_Spaceman,3,Thu Jun 11 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"the SCC to stick to their judicial and not political mandate   Where is the line between the two?   There's no review of their decisions   That's the very nature of the Supreme Court. They are the final say. This decision has repeatedly been appealed by the Federal government and affirmed by several courts, all the way now to the SC. At a certain point the government has to stop arguing with every court in the land, including the highest, stop playing wedge partisan politics, and do their damned job."
metacanada,39hgv4,MoosPalang,2,Thu Jun 11 23:44:50 2015 UTC,"The line is when they make policy decisions. Realistically its hard to draw but they're the ones who draw it and I, and many other people, don't think they're drawing it correctly.   The Supreme Court gets it wrong. Often. Hell they even said they got it wrong on Prostitution, Euthenasia and labour rights. In the ""living tree"" case they actually said that women weren't ""persons"". I would have no problem if they would strike down a law and then send it back to parliament to debate and if they decide, reenact or not. That's what happened prior to 1982 and the Charter, and Canada wasn't then a tyrannical dictatorship where people's rights were being infringed left and right. S.7, the provision they strike all the laws down with was never meant to do that. None of the provinces or Ottawa would have agreed to it, they just made that shit up themselves.  The final say in almost everything that isn't clearly a breach of human rights should be with the legislature. Because if they get it wrong, we have many mechanisms in place, from opposition to elections, to get it right. If the SCC fucks it up, we have to wait til they decide they were wrong and a case somehow makes it back to them.  Edit: the SCC is the actual problem because the lower courts just follow their lead, they actually have to."
metacanada,39hgv4,popcad,3,Fri Jun 12 00:15:50 2015 UTC,The line is when they make policy decisions.   How is this a policy decision?
metacanada,39hgv4,Pocahontas_Spaceman,2,Fri Jun 12 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"Deciding what drugs are available and what ways they can be used are clear policy choices. One would hope they would be made without regard to politics but that doesn't change their nature.  Here's a policy on therapeutic drugs from 1998, Here is a drug policy about dangerously combining drugs from 2006, there you could really say they ignored politics and made a proper policy decision. The World Health Organization's definition of health policy seems to encompass medical marijuana:   ""Health policy refers to decisions, plans, and actions that are undertaken to achieve specific health care goals within a society""   CDC's definition is really broad, which is usually good for policies. If this wasn't about more access to marijuana I can't imagine many people would be too thrilled that a bunch of former lawyers are telling them what they can or cannot take as medicine.  Now if you want to argue that Ambrose should be setting a broader policy for medical marijuana, or that she should set out a inquiry of sorts where the top doctors in the country recommend what the MM policy should be I would 100% agree. I don't give a shit what hippies smoke as long as it isn't killing them. All I care about here is the SCC again deciding they don't like Parliament so they're going to make policy decisions themselves. They did it with the Euthenasia decision, they used a dozen other countries who had legal euthenasia as a reason why Canada should have it too. The only thing is, all those other countries decided themselves (through their governments) to legalize it, meaning they decided on that policy, while other countries decided on a different policy. All fine, as long as the democratic part of government picks the policies, so they can be changed."
metacanada,39hgv4,popcad,3,Fri Jun 12 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"what ways they can be used are clear policy choices.   But again, this isn't what is occurring. It was HC who set an arbitrary line by saying you can only consume 'dried marijuana' even after  It's the court who simply said that distinction is arbitrary and that other forms of consumption should be allowed as well.   the SCC again deciding they don't like Parliament so they're going to make policy decisions themselves   But that's not what has happened. A case was brought to them, with numerous expert opinions weighing in, and this was the decision they came to. That's what a court does. You're presenting it as if the court just suddenly ruled weed is legal. That's not the case. What has happened, over the years, is issues being brought to court and court setting legal precedent. There is nothing out of the ordinary there. Legal precedent can and is set by the courts, it's part of why they exist, to allow people to challenge unjust laws. That's entirely within the law of the land. It's just that you're presenting it incorrectly."
metacanada,39hgv4,EggCouncil,2,Fri Jun 12 01:02:05 2015 UTC,"K it looks like you don't really know shit about the role of the judiciary. They aren't just separate from the legislative branch in their powers, they are a check against the legislative branch. After 1982, that case is even more so with the Charter.   You say the court has been formulating policy decisions, and apparently this is an example of it. This is what really lets me know you have no idea what you're talking about beyond the crap you read on reddit. Health care challenges that have gone to the supreme court have almost always been unsuccessful when pushing to expand coverage. The courts have been criticized for placing the rights of the individual above the rights of the community in some very important cases, and it is well known that the courts are very unlikely to help in the effort of expanding coverage. The few cases the Supreme Court has ruled against the government have been cases where not much money was involved and not many people were effected. This is an example of that.   Even in this case the court didn't formulate jack. All they did was repeal laws based on the Charter challenge. These judges are there for specific cases such as this, where our halfwit members of the lower chamber decide to play politics with peoples lives."
metacanada,39hgv4,SeinfeldSez,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:02:39 2015 UTC,"Lol politics with peoples lives? On weed cookies? OK champ. Other than that I'm 100% sure I understand the role of the judiciary significantly better than you, but that doesn't mean I have to agree with it. And the fact that health care challenges are almost always rejected but this one wasn't was an  argument that the court in this case wasn't making a policy decision? Buddy, you're more over your head than Trudeau here. Repealing laws that the legislature created is the biggest part about activist judges.  But you go pat yourself on the back now about your vast understanding of the judiciary."

IMO this government should either A: stop ramroding their ""Support the Troops"" message down our throats and stop trying to play in the big leagues.  Or B: put the money where their mouth is. I'm not looking at a giant budget like the US. Hell, I'd even settle for 1.5% of the GDP rather than the NATO 2%. (Then have /u/meydm tell me how he despises GDP as a unit of measuring Defence Spending)"
metacanada,39c5zx,lookingatyourcock,5,Wed Jun 10 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"Womp womp. You sure are. It is an arbitrary number. I don't think military spending should be tied to GDP. It should be based on planning and operational needs all with considerations to LCAM.  We have huge major capital and minor capital projects that need attention. The CAF and government should fund based on the need not GDP. If that means 1.5 or 5% it should be irrelevant.  If we need boats, fund boats. That funding shouldn't be tied to GDP. I think major Procurement projects in Canada need to be run by an Officer of Parliament who can oversee and report to Parliament on Procurement. In addition I think that the government should set the strategic priorities and leave it to the officer to achieve that end and bring those to Parliament for approval."
metacanada,39c5zx,SmugBlunderer,3,Wed Jun 10 21:04:36 2015 UTC,"But but but, I have academics like Michael Byers and the Rideau Institute telling me that we suck because of GDP and that we should return to peacekeeping!  Which is also my last point: Fuck peacekeeping."
metacanada,39c5zx,lookingatyourcock,2,Wed Jun 10 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"It should be based on planning and operational needs all with considerations to LCAM.   Isn't planning based on budget and capital constraints? Isn't the 2% recommendation related to needs, in the sense of we want each NATO member to be able to contribute 2% of their GDP's worth in military force in case its needed? How could you possibly know what you will need for an unknown future event? Isn't it always better to have a stronger military just in case? It's hard for me to imagine how there can be a cap on security needs."
metacanada,39c5zx,EPOSZ,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"Isn't it always better to have a stronger military just in case?   As a general rule, I would argue that it is. However, the question remains as to just how powerful you want that military to be, relatively speaking. What kind of a threat should we be able to respond to, and what is the nature of that response (e.g. scale and sophistication)? For example, are we looking to go toe-to-toe with the Russians? Or, could we get by with just being able to honour our commitments abroad in places like Europe? The former would probably be beyond our means in a conventional sense, and unattainable at the strategic level if we continued to maintain our commitment to non-proliferation treaties (i.e. we'd need nukes). The latter could be reasonably accommodated by the kind of modest or moderate spending that /u/Solid_s0ap and  /u/medym are talking about, respectively.  The problem with ""more is better,"" as I understand it, is that it leads to a creeping growth in both the new spending and operational costs of the military over time: new soldiers today means additional pension and benefits liabilities twenty years from now, new equipment means retraining, maintenance, and disposing of old stuff, etc. It's a big long-term commitment, and needs could change over time (e.g. what if we face a substantial reduction in the need for armed services and a simultaneous drop in government revenue?)."
metacanada,39c5zx,joetravers,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"So if costs are the constraint, then doesn't that provide some legitimacy to using percentage of GDP, or basically the most your economy can afford to handle, as the primary constraint?   What kind of a threat should we be able to respond to,    So the answer to this would be the most we can afford to handle with respect to GDP. Given that it takes several years to expand and upgrade our military capabilities, it doesn't make sense to me to make assumptions about the types of threats that will exist in the next decade or two. Governments can change overnight, and create new threats from countries that were previously neutral or friendly.    The former would probably be beyond our means in a conventional sense, and unattainable at the strategic level if we continued to maintain our commitment to non-proliferation treaties (i.e. we'd need nukes).   Why do you think the Russians would use nukes if they are only interested in a limited region of the arctic? Obviously the US would step in if they did that, so I don't see that as being a factor. Seems like that would be a situation that revolved around response time, where the Russians would seize on a moment of weakness(espionage could create such an opportunity) by rushing forces to occupy the region that they are interested in, then holding that position. That way we could be painted as instigators if they were able to move into that holding position with minimal resistance. Especially when it's over land they claimed before us via the UN. It's my understanding that there is preventative value in being able to mobilize enough forces to slow them down, and making a hypothetical battle costly in terms of both money and international reputation.    The problem with ""more is better,"" as I understand it, is that it leads to a creeping growth in both the new spending and operational costs of the military over time:    Yea I'm certainly not arguing for limitless growth. Just that the military budget should be based on national ecenomic considerations, rather than capping the military budget even if we can afford to spend more, based on attempts to estimate future threats many years down the road. Costs ending up higher than estimated is typical of any bureaucracy, so you plan for those creeping costs."

In the event of the next major conflict, we can realistically deploy around a battle group's worth of people (so around 2500), only less than 1,000 of that actually do the fighting (which is really is not an issue depending on who you talk to). HOWEVER, we don't have a lot of key capabilities to ensure battlefield survivability (i.e. AD platforms, infantry portable Anti Armour, Mobile bridging, CSAR etc) and thus have to rely on allies (namely the Americans).  I remember when the Poland mission first came about and rumours started flying about ""fighting the Russians again"", my Company 2IC just went ""how about let's NOT fight the Russians? because we will be wiped out in the first 20 minutes""    Then there are the buzzwords of ""logistic support"" for UN missions if we are not contributing a peacekeeping contingent and ""Canadian expertise"" in Winter Warfare- We have issues even supplying our own troops in the field, and again have to rely on americans at time, and we realistically cannot operate on our own as a nation.  And on winter ""expertise"", a lot of winter clothing has been listed as ""controlled"" items (hence why I went ""...."" when we sent ""Surplus"" equipment to the Ukraine) so troops have problems getting basic stuff that they needed to conduct winter ops (Not to mention we no longer have winter vehicles like BV-206s) and because of Afghanistan, we have lost a lot of experiences as older troops get out, and the new troops relearning how to survive in tents."

metacanada,39c5zx,lookingatyourcock,3,Wed Jun 10 23:31:24 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of different ways, and it happens indirectly. Filling out available jobs and decreasing the cost of labor allows businesses to grow, and makes it easier to start your own business. If jobs aren't paying enough, or they are too hard to get, then you should be starting your own business.   On a side note, there are parts of Canada that have major labor shortages. There are many small towns/villages in Saskatchewan which have businesses that wouldn't be able to exist without TFW's, because literally no one else wants to work there. If there is a problem, it has more to do with labor mobility."
metacanada,39c5zx,MrFlagg,5,Wed Jun 10 23:46:44 2015 UTC,again mostly bullshit.  Allowing one FTW in a town with 10% unemployment to wash dishes in an established restaurant isn't creating any fucking job anywhere.
metacanada,39c5zx,LicencetoShill007,4,Wed Jun 10 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about businesses that literally did not exist before. Places where oil workers needed a place to sleep and eat which didn't have anything nearby. There is more to Canada than just the east. Saskatchewan has had major labor shortages for years now. Our economy could not grow at the pace it has without being able to get labor from TFW's, and other similar programs.   And you're completely ignoring my argument and just restating your original argument which I already refuted. What part of my rebuttal did you fail to understand?"
metacanada,39c5zx,lookingatyourcock,2,Thu Jun 11 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"On a larger scale they do have an effect because they leave more money in the pockets of the business owners which leaves them with more capital to reinvest in their business (or others).  They also reduce upward pressure on prices by enabling businesses to sustain growth via cost reductions instead and these profits, if reinvested elsewhere in the economy, would also create jobs.  There are plenty of arguments against the policy (ie. it puts downward pressure on wages, it's not compatible with free market ideals,  they won't necessarily reinvest in a Canadian business, etc.) but there are plenty of benefits to TFWs and job creation would be one of them.     Whether or not it's a beneficial policy overall is anyone's guess and likely impossible to determine, but there are going to be pros and cons to any policy and my guess (as an econ grad) is that some amount of job creation would be one of the benefits.  Of course more money in the pockets of lower income people (who are hardest hit by TFWs) would also create some amount of jobs via increased spending so it's not like this is the only way to do it."
metacanada,39c5zx,SmugBlunderer,3,Thu Jun 11 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining more of the details which I was too lazy to go into. It's a big topic with a lot of variables at play.   To my recollection, the only dispute among economists is about possible short term consequences, but mostly unanimous agreement on the long term benefits. I'm on mobile now though, so I don't have the link available to back that up. Labor supply is a significant constraint on economic growth though. A business can have all sorts of money from increased consumer spending, but those benefits are limited if you can't find any workers. Canada has the potential to have similar economic power as the US given how much land and natural resources we have. We just need the population.   The only caveat I have about immigration is that we should try to look into the type of beliefs an immigrant has. People who hold ideologies that glorify violence such as Islam does should be filtered out. The economic benefits go out the window if there is a rise in terrorism."

metacanada,39c5zx,Lord_B,10,Thu Jun 11 00:15:52 2015 UTC,Hmm. The new prostitution laws are the most recent that come to mind. I suspect that it would be more effective to deal with human trafficking by carefully regulating the industry. That way you have increased odds of there being paper trail to aid in the investigation. It also makes no sense to me to punish consensual transactions due to the existence of unconsentual ones. Wouldn't that be like making janitorial or construction work illegal since sometimes illegal immigrants are forced to do it without pay? Human trafficking is bigger than just the sex industry.

metacanada,39c5zx,beener,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"Regulation doesn't work, Holland Australia and Germany has seen massive increases in trafficking after regulation, which gives traffickers a statutory shield to hide what they're doing. Punishing the buyers pushes prostitution indoors (not underground) where its actually safer, while decreasing demand and decreasing the incentive to traffick.  Our model is basically the Nordic model, and the EU is adopting it as their model code for prostitution. Its not a bad legislation."
metacanada,39c5zx,toughitoutcupcake,2,Thu Jun 11 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"At least in Ontario, brothels are already legal.  still not regulated though.  prostitution should just be legal and regulated.  any sort of prohibition on things like sex is just ridiculous in my mind.  If I take a girl out for dinner and hAve a one night stand is that all that different (morally) then getting jacked off at the end of a massage? Or texting an escort off I found on the Internet? Is there that big of a difference between tinder and backpage? I don't think so."
metacanada,39c5zx,ThusShatZarathustra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:20:09 2015 UTC,"Regulation doesn't work, Holland Australia and Germany has seen massive increases in trafficking after regulation,    I don't think it's fair to generalize all forms of regulation. There a huge number of very different ways to regulate it. Prioritization by law enforcement, budgets for task forces who specialize on human trafficking, coordination with intelligence agencies, and the type of privacy laws that limit what law enforcement can do are all huge huge factors.   Secondly, even if legalizing did increase human trafficking in and of it self, or doesn't help with investigating human trafficking, it still does not justify punishing consentual transactions. Ruining the life of a buyer that didn't harm anyone, or at least didn't knowingly harm anyone, in order to save those lives of those who are trafficked is not an improvement. It's just shifting the harm to someone else."
metacanada,39c5zx,EggCouncil,2,Thu Jun 11 01:34:49 2015 UTC,"I would like to see an update of the section of the Criminal Code that deals with prostitution, but I don't want the federal government regulating the industry any differently than it does with other industries.  The provinces should take a greater role in handling prostitution, as they already handle booze, tobacco, gambling, healthcare, and labour.   It's already nominally legal, but there are too many ambiguities with the status quo. When I worked for an escort service, there was this ridiculous gray area for the job I was doing: I was responsible for driving the girl to clients and ensuring her safety, but I could easily have been rolled up on some flimsy charge if a cop decided to give me a hard time. It's an intrinsically greasy business, and like casinos most agencies are generally only a degree or two of separation from organized crime, but it could be made better with just a few tweaks of the criminal code and some testicular fortitude on the part of provincial governments."

Nothing pisses me off more than people who play up the patriotism image then fuck over those who serve their country.  The logic behind dropping the long form census was paper thin, and in no way made up for the harm it will do. Having good statistics is key for knowing if our public policies are working or not.   The Omnibus crime bill rammed through parliament was dumb. Not just for the lack of review it gave the content of terrible bill, but also for the dangerous precedent that it has set. Now that it has been done by the Tories you can be sure the other parties will want to have their turn ramming shitty laws through the system.   Adding an extension to copyright laws in the budget. We need copyright reform sure, but hiding it in the budget was a bunch of bullshit. It seems pretty obvious that the Tories knew that it was shit, there is no other reason to have hidden it in there.  The F-35 decision. Buy the goddamn plane, or don't.

Closing the Experimental Lakes Area was dumb. The argument that it would save money doesn't hold water. Shutting it down and doing the cleanup was going to cost more money in the short term, any savings from closing it down wouldn't be seen for a few years. This pay-now save-later is the exact opposite of what we should have been doing during an economic crisis.   Obama needed Harper to throw him a life line on the Keystone XL issue. Tighten up the regulation, offer to provide for the costs of cleanup, do something. Instead Harper just sat there doing nothing, and now we are going to be shipping oil on less efficient, more dangerous, trains. We really snatched defeat from the jaws of victory on that one.  The BoC has held interest rates crazy low now for years, there is huge amounts of capital out there for anyone who wants it. So why did the government come out with a token increase on income tax instead of going after the generous capital gains tax terms? We are swimming in cheap credit, there is no need to be cutting investors so much slack.  The Harper government needs to stop losing so many cases in the supreme court.

Per-vote subsidy by definition means the playing field isn't level, as the incumbent party always gets the most money.  Being incompetent in fundraising without theft or forced union dues does not excuse ""unequal"" funding.  NB:  Also, the biggest argument against per vote is that it's a profoundly huge conflict of interest.  It's literally taking money from people (both who vote and who don't via taxes) and give them to a private group of people (a political party) who make the rules about taxes.

Eliminating the per-vote subsidy is like replacing our current progressive tax system with a flat tax, it's only fair in a cheeky, ignore the elephant in the room sort of way. It ensures that your power to influence politics is strongly related to you means to pay for access to the political system. I also don't see how it is a conflict of interest, voters are directly deciding who gets the money, not the politicians. It is certainly less likely to be abused than the way most government funding is done, through a massive budget few people ever actually read.

Amuses me in many ways.    It's as if the artists didn't need to find someone to introduce them to ""money"" to get big paydays...  then stab themself/ves in the back to taddle tale on him to the star.  now what smarty pant artists?    Doorknob Soloman didn't even have the street smarts to disclose this.  Fucking moron.  And he is a face of the CBC... people joke about judgement of politicians... this guy is a tax payer funded 'journalist' for the integrity of Canadian news and looks like a younger version of the duffster but who got caught early.  For noobs, duffy spent many years at the cbc.  And screw the star.  Headline whoring over nothing that is really meaningful.  Some moron at the CBC with facetime on camera (semi-famous to newsies) sold fucking art in his spare time to his contacts.  In related news, don cherry used to whore himself to 'rockem sockem hockey vhs tapes' and they were pretty bloody cool.  this tabloid is just trash.  A high five of fuck you for this story that screwed over a moron and a bunch of his moron artisan buds.  And screw the cbc management.  This moron got sentenced by a toronto star headline of all things.  After the Q woman beater got notoriety in the press it would seem that other idiots get the ban hammer due to him.  Shit, I wonder if the people working there are more scared by 'cover their ass' management or losing budget from Harper...

This is profit. You are yourself going to be able to influence others. This is also profit. In due course, you may be offered the job of governor general, or senator.  Both Michael Jean and Adrienne Clarkson worked for the CBC, and became famous for doing so. Both were given the governor general role because of that fame, yet CBC did not seem to mind. Peter Mansbridge, another famous CBC employee, had a teaching gig, which I suspect he would not have gotten had his name not been so recognizable, so CBC is hardly being consistent.  Back to Solomon, from what I gather, he was doing his art networking on his personal time. It reaches too far, in my opinion, when a company can insist that you not interact with people you have met on the job."

metacanada,395sb2,SmugBlunderer,4,Tue Jun 9 16:24:30 2015 UTC,Question for the frogs of /r/metacanada: is there any argument for the relevancy of the Bloc in the upcoming election?   Depends. Duceppe has a good reputation and he may be able to chip away the soft sovereignist vote from the NDP if they can lower Mulcair's reputation by using his past at the QLP.  He may also steal one or two Tory seats if Harper actually does avoid the SRC debates.
metacanada,395sb2,Jesus_H_Christos,2,Tue Jun 9 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of percentage points. If the Bloc can peel away 5 points from the NDP, it pulls them down to 32% (iirc) and without any gains across Canada to offset that change, it'll drag their seat count down. Incumbency matters but matters least in Quebec. GD is a brilliant politician and can hold up in the French debates against Mulcair, taking the heat off of JT and SH.  In fact, those two parties would do best to stick to the message and watch Angry Tom Bear get fired up when Duceppe owns him. It'll be beautiful.

Even if you ignored the studies that our local universities put out saying that a typical BA would have about a 40% chance of getting a job with his degree (60% for BSc), you could go to the career fair and see that the only guaranteed work goes to accountants and engineers.

Or at least turn more newcomers and moderates against them?    No.   You are assuming that these people are pushing for their own beliefs, and that those beliefs happen to align with the circle jerk. But really this isn't the case. A lot of these people are young and have no idea what things are like in wider world. The circle jerk isn't too extreme, too left, or too right, it just is. It's the world they know, it's their baseline. That is why polls and data that go against their beliefs are to contentious, it doesn't match their reality.  They probably legitimately don't know a young person who votes conservative, or someone who is pro-C51. They don't support the circle jerk because it resonates with their own beliefs, they support the circle jerk itself, and their beliefs flow from that.  Now eventually as the circle jerk moves to be more extreme, some people will resist moving along with it. For some people their beliefs got 'locked-in' when they joined and will leave when things get too extreme. But as long as the group leaving is smaller in number than new people joining it won't shrink. For some of them, their beliefs didn't 'lock-in' and are free to move along with the circle-jerk. And for some the circle jerk is their tribe. It is a source of identity and belonging from where they derive personal validation. For this last group it doesn't really matter if things get more or less extreme because it isn't really about what you believe it is about where you belong."

metacanada,38wsia,lookingatyourcock,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:42:56 2015 UTC,"It's been slowly happening for a few years now. I think it began in 2012 with the commemoration of the War of 1812 (i.e. the War that Most People Forgot). The Government spent money, time and effort promoting Canada's historical military past. Here is a G&M article about it from 2012.  The article makes reference to Ian McKay’s and Jamie Swift’s book, Warrior Nation, a review of which you can find here.  At the risk of going all tinfoil-hat crazy, and I do admit it's a stretch, it seems odd that the Government would promote our military history but neglect other traditionally celebrated milestones (the inception of the Canadian flag comes to mind). It does however resonate with the CPC's base of voters, who value military service and honour those who have served with great zeal. It also serves to underscore the Government's re-branding of itself, as being moral, righteous, just and strong. This fits in well with the narrative created over the Ukraine, and helps Canada maintain a strong position with respect to the Arctic. All in all, creating this ""warrior culture"" is not as crazy as it sounds; I simply disagree with it, because Canada is much more than that."
metacanada,38wsia,dasoberirishman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:21:45 2015 UTC,"Support for military is much broader than the CPC base. The military is honoured because it is the most important institution of any government. Sovereignty can not exist without it, and the government has no power without it. Given that we are a democracy, and democracy depends on our military, it is important that our government remind and instruct the public about its importance. If too much of the public ignores our military, then we risk electing a future government that will neglect it, which would lead to the collapse of our sovereignty.   As for foreign involvement, I still don't understand why you are dismissing the moral value. It seems like you start out with the assumption that the government lies, and then try to figure out an alternative.   What do you mean by ""rebranding?"" You mentioned beforehand examples of how Canada has always been willing to intervene. What exactly is new? Are you aware that it was the Liberal government that sent us to Afghanistan? Canada has always been willing to get involved in international affairs throughout its entire history."

As for foreign involvement, I still don't understand why you are dismissing the moral value. It seems like you start out with the assumption that the government lies, and then try to figure out an alternative.    When did I dismiss the moral value of becoming involved in foreign conflicts? It was never implied by my statement that Canada is more than a ""warrior"" nation; our Forces exist to do exactly that, project force. Besides, I'm addressing the curious narrative being espoused by the Government since 2012; a narrative which never before existed, and which seems to be promoted not only as a domestic campaign but also in an attempt to convince international partners that Canada has moved on from merely peace keeping.   What do you mean by ""rebranding?""    Literally that. It's a marketing campaign.   You mentioned beforehand examples of how Canada has always been willing to intervene. What exactly is new?    Nothing is new. I stated a fact. Canada is always willing to intervene. But that does not make our Forces part of a ""warrior"" nation, nor do I agree with the narrative being pushed forward.

metacanada,38suop,inhuman4,5,Mon Jun 15 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"Harper really mismanaged this recovery! You see, if he had invested in education, it would crate jobs in a few decades, and that would totally effect the economy now! If you disagree, you're probably some stupid partisan, because knowing how an economy works is a partisan issue apparently.  Also, this thread contains a hidden bonus!!. My favourite reply when they talk themselves into a corner:   This is reddit, not a research paper. I'm not putting effort into something that most will ignore and agree or disagree with based on partisan lines solely.   You see, I could *totally answer your question, but I just don't have time! Now, allow me to continue to spend my precious time typing long, convoluted responses that still don't answer the question."

And Tim's always seems to be on the sides of highways.   That said, I'm skeptical about the effectiveness of such an approach. It's hard for me to imagine this being an issue that enough people would care about. My gut tells me that there are more environmentalist hippy types than there are pro oil types. If this is true, then it would be more profitable for Tim Horton's to accept our boycott than theirs. The real issue, as I see it, is the growth of environmental populism. But anyways, that's just my gut talking, and I really have no idea. So I have no position in this, and would need to look into it more."

metacanada,38ii6z,Pocahontas_Spaceman,3,Thu Jun 4 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"The TRC are co-opting the word since it has greater impact. They should have said ""ethnic cleansing"" since, in the end, the Government's policy at the time was to teach the Aboriginals to read, write, speaking English, and grow into productive members of society. At that time, being Aboriginal meant none of those things. Truth is, the Church and the Government went about this in a heavy-handed, patchwork, neglectful manner and their goals were not as laudable as they seemed - make the red man white and all our (read: Government's) problems will go away. That's what I call ethnic cleansing.  Of course, the term has less political appeal - and impact - than saying ""genocide"". And so here we are, talking about this nonsense."
metacanada,38ii6z,dasoberirishman,5,Thu Jun 4 16:45:49 2015 UTC,ethnic cleansing   They should have used an ethnic laundering approach (e.g. split them into small groups and then transport them to Panama and then to Switzerland and then back to Canada)
metacanada,38ii6z,EggCouncil,2,Thu Jun 4 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"[Meta off]  I think that people are struggling to find an appropriate description of just what Canada's successive governments were trying to accomplish, or what they effectively did.   Personally, I believe that the UN's definition of genocide, which has reared its odious head once more in the wake of the TRC findings, is far too general, and either trivializes conventional examples of genocide or exaggerates the severity of malign historical policies like the residential school program.   There are people who are sincerely arguing that the residential school program compares to modern examples of campaigns to entirely destroy groups of people through violence, and I think that's shameful and misguided. We would be having a very different conversation in Canada if our antecedents had been killing natives en masse.  ""Ethnic cleansing"" is, for lack of a better description, probably more accurate than genocide. The government was after all trying to ""get the Indian out of the child,"" through repression and inculcation, not through mass slaughter."

Everything is circumstance or mental health...  I thought I was a bleeding heart when it came to crime and justice but this is unbelievable. Bonus points for all of the legal super-experts that are absolutely certain that this is an open-and-closed case of entrapment.
metacanada,38d6re,bkswan,3,Wed Jun 3 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"metaoff: Counterpoint: These guys would likely have never done shit without the RCMP's help, and the issue certainly highlights that thin line between police work and entrapment. Are they guilty? Yep. Is it good the RCMP made sure they didn't do something for real? Yep. Were the methods by which they incriminated themselves kinda shady and need further looking into? Yes.   metaon: fuck you these guys are mentally ill and needed marijuana not prison!"

I guess I'm just not terribly sympathetic to assholes that could be nudged (or even moderately shoved) towards committing a terrorist act like they were.  It'll all come out in the appeals or whatever whether or not it was entrapment, I guess.  Either way... Fuck 'em.  BTW, I completely love the people in that thread that suggest once the RCMP established that these people were willing and going to attempt to fuck shit up, they should've been offered counseling instead of arresting them."

I didn't read everything presented so I'm not certain on all of the facts but weren't they actively looking for help in committing some sort of attack?   they were. But they were very, VERY incompetent. Dude thought he was going to build a rocket. The RCMP had to keep encouraging him to build the bomb instead. The court is actually reviewing the evidence that the RCMP entrapped them, and the defense has presented some pretty good evidence to support this.   Again, I'm not defending these idiots, i'm just saying he RCMP's tactics should be scrutinized, too. I don't think it's black and white. If you followed the case, they really were genuinely mentally retarded morons.* That doesn't negate their guilt, but I don't like that the RCMP gets to entrap people like that. I can see both sides of it, and I get that you have to do that to prevent people from doing shit on their own, and they followed through with it, so obviously they (the perps) had intent, but...   metaon: they just needed a hug, dude.  *holy fucking shit, is this marvo and his hot wife?"
metacanada,38d6re,Pocahontas_Spaceman,4,Wed Jun 3 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"There was no entrapment by strict definition.  For example, if you give a person the opportunity to buy a stolen firearm and they buy it, it isn't entrapment. You've given them an opportunity but they took it.  SCC has made it very clear about what constitutes the ""two types"" of entrapment. From the wiki page:   The first type of entrapment, ""random virtue testing"", occurs when the police offer an individual the opportunity to commit a crime without reasonable suspicion that either that individual, or the place where that individual is located, is associated with the criminal activity under investigation. If police do have such a reasonable suspicion, they are still limited to providing only an opportunity to commit the offense.  The second form of entrapment occurs when the police go beyond merely providing an opportunity to commit an offense, and instead actually induce the commission of the offense. Some factors a court may consider when deciding whether police have induced the offense include the type of crime being investigated, whether an average person would have been induced, the persistence and number of attempts made by the police, the type of inducement used (e.g. fraud, deceit, reward), and the existence of expressed or implied threats.   It's a fine line but given the totality of the circumstances made public (that I've read anyways), these two undoubtedly planned to do something, and made steps to do those things, to undertake a terrorist act against Canada.

Apparently, no one would ever make fun of a fat guy for being fat. Only women are subjected to this.  Nevermind the fact they couldn't be bothered to even finish their own arguments; they simply move into a gender issues line of thinking. It's not about being fat anymore, it's about being a fat woman.  Give me a fucking break. If you're fat, and a health minister, you will be mocked regardless of your gender. It's that simple. Look at Quebec and Belgium. Their ministers got properly reamed in social media (and in newspapers) for being the equivalent of two people on the bathroom scale.  People twisting simple, straightforward issues such as this into Tumblr-esque misogynistic body-shaming of cis females and whateverthefuck just piss me off.  A member of the PC party said something stupid about a fat lady and now he'll face the consequences. This is the FHRITP issue all over again. Calm the fuck down, people.

metacanada,388gan,dasoberirishman,11,Tue Jun 2 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, ""cis"" is a scientific term denoting or relating to a molecular structure in which two particular atoms or groups lie on the same side of a given plane in the molecule, in particular denoting an isomer in which substituents at opposite ends of a carbon–carbon double bond are on the same side of the bond. I got that from Wikipedia.  In social media (read: Tumblr), it is a shorthand for ""cisgendered"" and has been hi-jacked by SJWs and bored, middle-class white kids to help accurately identify someone's gender identity. A ""cis male"" is a male born a male and raised a male. ""Cis"" males are generally held to be, at least on Tumblr, as bad if not worse than slave owners, Hitler, the KKK, the Koch Brothers, Noriega, Milosevic, Gaddafi, cancer, AIDS and all of North Korea combined. Because ""privilege""."

We call upon the federal government to eliminate barriers to the creation of additional Aboriginal healing lodges within the federal correctional system.    Or this one.    In keeping with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we call upon the federal government, in collaboration with Aboriginal organizations, to fund the establishment of Indigenous law institutes for the development, use, and understanding of Indigenous law and access to justice in accordance with the unique cultures of Aboriginal peoples in Canada.    Looks like he's going to get Pope Francis on the horn too, they're on good terms right?    We call upon the Pope to issue an apology to Survivors, their families, and communities for the Roman Catholic Church’s role in the spiritual, cultural, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of First Nations, Inuit, and Metis children in Catholic-run residential schools. We call for that apology to be similar to the 2010 apology issued to Irish victims of abuse and to occur within one year of the issuing of this Report and to be delivered by the Pope in Canada.    He's going to put a new monument to white guilt in every capital city too.    We call upon provincial and territorial government, in collaboration with Survivors and their organizations, and other parties to the Settlement Agreement, to commission and install a publicly accessible, highly visible, Residential Schools Monument in each capital city to honour Survivors and all the children who were lost to their families and communities.    For good measure he's also going to change the oath to citizenship too.     We call upon the Government of Canada to replace the Oath of Citizenship with the following: . I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada including Treaties with Indigenous Peoples, and fulfill my duties as a Canadian citizen.

metacanada,387x1k,EggCouncil,3,Wed Jun 3 05:49:45 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: this is bullshit  368,000 soldiers served in Europe 200,000 air force personnel served as well. That's 568,000  Of these 43,000 died.  43,000/568,000 = 7.6%  This is  if you ignore all the soldiers who never left Canadian soil or were drafted but never served. Which makes sense because the headline clearly indicates combat fatalities.  At residential school 6,000/150,000 kids died = 4%  So nearly double the soldiers died in WWII than residential schools. That's still bad odds for the children but don't fucking compare residential schools to WWII as if they were the same fucking thing."

Have you tried losing weight? It's impossible, she is clearly trying hard despite all evidence to the contrary.    her weight would still take months to years to return to a healthier level   So cut the fucking lady a break, it would take time to lose weight, that's why she's never been able to do it in her entire life.

People made fun of Rob Ford's weight all the time too, there was no outrage about that.   You can try to appeal to users if you want, but the metacanada mods won't be enforcing any rules about hurting people's feelings by making petty insults. If we're going to make fun of ugly people, poor people, young people, and all other groups, then we're definitely going to be allowed to say whatever we want about fat people too. If anything they're a more fair target because it's something that can be changed, and it's a lifestyle choice rather than something you were born with.   Either everything's allowed, or nothing's allowed. Here, everything's allowed, except things that could result in getting the sub banned."
