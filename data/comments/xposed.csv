xposed,3ck09r,OisinOskar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"Xposed modules that affect the visuals of my Note 4 are my favourite, here are a couple more in addition to the great suggestions already shared.    Keyboard Tinter: this is my FAVOURITE module. This tints the keys on the keyboard when you tap them, so as you are typing, each key press can have a different colour. It is so simple, but so fun to type with different colours.  Flat Style Bar Indicators: this allows you to modify the network, wifi, battery and clock icons in the navigation bar. Lovely, and free (you can pay for more icons).  Flat Style Colored Bars: this module tints the navigation bar, so that whatever app you are in tints the nav bar to that colour.  Hide Notification Panel Handle: As it says, this makes the Blurred System UI much more visually appealing.  Smooth System Progress Bars: This makes the progress bar much more smooth, and beautiful.  Statusbar Volume: This is amazing, as it gets rid of the obtrusive volume panel and instead moves your volume control to overlay on the system nav bar. Beautiful, and worth the $1 after the free 14 day trial.  XGPM: If you use Google Music, this colour codes all of the buttons, increases the size of the artwork, looks amazing!!    Hope you enjoy trying all of these modules out :)"

To disable Xposed, you'll have to repeatedly tap one of the hardware buttons (Power, Volume, or Home) on your device during startup.  During boot, your device will vibrate twice when it detects the first key press. You'll then have five seconds to press that same button four more times, with each keystroke producing a short single vibration. After ending with a long vibration, your device will disable and prevent most of Xposed's actions, allowing you to easily troubleshoot problematic modules.""  http://android.wonderhowto.com/inspiration/everything-you-need-know-about-new-xposed-installer-version-2-5-0152740"

And final reason, why not."
xposed,3by1f2,phreshjive,-13,Fri Jul 3 03:35:59 2015 UTC,Because at least there is the covert aspect to TabletMetrics. You're just giving the big ol' middle finger to Spotify. Not a smart move.

xposed,3by1f2,iWizardB,2,Fri Jul 3 09:03:09 2015 UTC,Look at what Majinferno wrote is why. Replace getting with paying. Positive this loophole that was used by those with enough wherewithal will soon enough be closed.

But, one thing you cannot change is the hardware switch that powers off your phone when you hold the button in for 5 seconds, resulting in a reboot/shutdown.

I have attempted to skip the ads and enable offline mode with little luck(I can differentiate a song from an ad but still can't skip it, probably because the method changes per update), but even still if I got it to work, I probably can't release it, as spotify will be over me faster than a speeding bullet.

xposed,3bgjbs,abqnm666,10,Mon Jun 29 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"Note about this release: see update below  As of now, many users, including myself, are finding that the new release (framework v65 and installer v3-alpha3) doesn't work properly, so you may want to wait a little while for an updated release before upgrading from framework v64 and installer v3-alpha2.  The exact issue is that once installed, there is a red error in the front page of the installer saying the framework isn't active, but inside the framework section, it shows as active. Most people are finding that no modules will work. I had a slightly different experience, in that after install, everything worked great, aside from the red error saying it wasn't activated. I updated a module and rebooted and that was that. Now, even though it still said it was not active (but still showing active inside the framework page of the installer), none of my modules worked. So I removed the module I updated, rebooted, and no luck. Then I tried reverting just the installer apk, and that had no effect either. In the end, I had to go back to the previous v64 (20150430) and installer v3-alpha2.  So not everything is working as designed yet with the new version. It may work on some devices under some circumstances, but it's not fully functional.  (Note: I'm referring to the official build as I'm on 5.0.1 with this device.)  Update: rovo89 released a new installer version that fixes the error message and the modules list being wiped out after installing or updating a module. I have tested everything I can think of and it works normally after every function I've tired. So I'd say it seems fixed now.   The new installer is v3.0-alpha4. The framework is still version 65 as it was yesterday."

It's a bug.   Have you installed or updated any modules since updating the framework? That's where mine went wrong.

I simply uninstalled the xposed installer, rebooted to recovery, flashed the older version and rebooted. Then I had to re-enable my modules since uninstalling the installer to revert deleted the app data. The modules don't need to be installed again as they are apps separate from the framework.

Just make sure to download the right version of it (there is one for arm and one for arm64 processors) and the apk.   Install the apk.   You can then boot into recovery. MAKE A BACKUP FIRST  Then install the framework via recovery.   It will take a long time to boot the first time. If it does not boot for say 15 minutes,  it's probably bootlooping / stuck.   If it boots and performs fine,  you are good to go. You may need a soft reboot then,  but it really depends on the device.

In standby mode, it uses only enough power to maintain a connection with cell towers and receive information. In active mode, the radio consumes significantly more power and is in a state to transmit data as well as receiving it. The radio switches into active mode anytime a connection is made by an app or the OS.  In KitKat, the radio would go back to standby mode once the connection was closed. In Lollipop, there is a bug either in closing connections or in the mobile radio returning to stanby once all connections are closed. This leads to significant battery drain as the mobile radio is in active state WAY longer than necessary.

xposed,3ahwc0,Minnesota_Winter,10,Sat Jun 20 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"It's worse than that. Flash doesn't work like a spinning hard disk. There's two issues.  1) You can write to blank flash pages, but you can't overwrite flash pages that have already been written to. They need to be erased and turned into blank pages first.  2) You can't erase a single 4 kilobyte page. You can only erase 128 page blocks.  So if you add a line of text to a log file or something, it gets a bit complicated. The first generation of solid state disks for PCs had shockingly bad performance at times, because to write one 4K page they'd read 127 pages into RAM, erase the block then write 128 pages back to flash. This is called write amplification and it destroys performance. For a year or two, only Intel SSDs really worked properly.  Modern systems have a command they issue called TRIM, which lets the operating system explicitly tell an SSD or flash controller that data doesn't need to be kept anymore, so the SSD can go ahead and erase those flash pages.  If the recovery issues TRIM commands when it wipes and formats /data, which it should for performance reasons, that data was destroyed by the format. Reading the partition with data recovery tools would show that everything was just zeroes except for the new filesystem you just wrote.  You might get somewhere by sending the device away for professional data recovery, but I doubt it.  tl;dr data is actually destroyed when you wipe flash, it doesn't just write a new file allocation table and leave the data sitting around like a hard disk."
xposed,3ahwc0,zurohki,2,Sat Jun 20 12:35:01 2015 UTC,"Trim (computing):       A Trim command (commonly typeset as TRIM) allows an operating system to inform a solid-state drive (SSD) which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally.   Trim was introduced soon after SSDs started to become an affordable alternative to traditional hard disks. Because low-level operation of SSDs differs significantly from hard drives, the typical way in which operating systems handle operations like deletes and formats resulted in unanticipated progressive performance degradation of write operations on SSDs.  Trimming enables the SSD to handle garbage collection overhead, which would otherwise significantly slow down future write operations to the involved blocks, in advance.   Although tools to ""reset"" some drives to a fresh state were already available before the introduction of trimming, they also delete all data on the drive, which makes them impractical to use for ongoing optimization.  By 2014 many SSDs had internal idle/background garbage collection mechanisms that work independently of trimming; although this successfully maintains their performance even under operating systems that do not support Trim, it has the associated drawbacks of increased write amplification and wear of the flash cells.

xposed,3ahwc0,_Aile,43,Sat Jun 20 16:00:13 2015 UTC,"Two years worth of everything from pictures to contacts to messages, literally EVERYTHING.   Why the fuck did you not even backup anything?  This is your own fault. A cellphone is unreliable to begin with (it can randomly break, you might lose it and so on), and you're using custom software...  I can't believe you never even logged into google (http://contacts.google.com)... or used any photo backup. My mother has more backup than you, and she didn't even do a single thing except log in to gmail and started the google+ app once and said ""yes"" to the ""auto backup images"" question.  Hopefully, this extreme ignorance of yours will be handled now that you've lost it all."

xposed,3ahwc0,Slabbo,7,Sun Jun 21 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, so you accidentally formatted your /data partition.  I rambled elsewhere about flash storage, so I'll summarise here:  If the recovery you were using, I assume TWRP or CWM, issues TRIM commands when it formats, your data was actually destroyed by the format. You could try sending the phone away to a professional data recovery service who could unsolder the flash chip from the phone's mainboard and try to extract data from it, but even that probably won't work.  If the recovery didn't TRIM when it formatted, which it probably did, then you can use a data recovery app to try and recover deleted files from your /data partition and see if it finds anything. Even if this works, a lot of files will have been overwritten and will be unrecoverable."

I never even boot my phone without a nandroid backup on my SD, and I can't count how many times it's saved me. You're running unofficial software that regular people like you and I created for free. Shit is going to go wrong sometimes. You HAVE to make and keep a backup, on more than one device if possible.   And I don't want to sound harsh, but by the sound of your post, you need to do more reading and research before you go screwing around with this stuff. As was just demonstrated to you, it can and will fuck up your device if you don't follow directions perfectly. Sometimes even when you DO follow them perfectly."

xposed,3ahwc0,jld2k6,2,Mon Jun 22 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"Are you on a custom ROM or are you on stock Touchwiz? If you are on a custom ROM like CM usually you can just reinstall the ROM. It will remove xposed and keep your data. If you're on stock Touchwiz reinstalling won't be an option. I know this is an I told you so moment but you really ignored all of the warnings about backing up when installing xposed or any modules!? This is very common when installing xposed and xposed IS a technical app that makes big changes.  Xposed also usually has a bunch of warnings about it being VERY likely to make your phone boot loop when installing on Touchwiz so I'm hoping you didn't just ignore all of that and are on a custom ROM :o  Edit: Oops. I thought OP said the phone recommend he wipe his data, not that he actually DID wipe it. As everyone already figured out up above. Yep, OP is fucked :( My god I am so upset that you chose to wipe your data when you purposely never backed up your stuff. This was bound to happen. It's almost statistically impossible that anyone this day and age will make it through life without ever needing a backup. The good news is that this is the kind of mistake a person usually only makes once in their life."
xposed,3ahwc0,GrayBoltWolf,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:01:53 2015 UTC,Xposed has a very easy disable method that can be done in most recoveries and without a computer. If you didn't wipe anything it would have been a 30 second fix.

xposed,3ahwc0,GrayBoltWolf,4,Sat Jun 20 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"No, it didn't.  Look at what is actually inside of Xposed-Disabler-Recovery.zip.  The update-binary script is very simple and simply simply restores the original app_process file that the Xposed installer replaced in the first place.  It is not capable of wiping or doing anything else.  My guess is you flashed something else entirely, or accidentially chose the wipe option in your recovery."
xposed,3ahwc0,Bossballoon,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"I can't answer for that but all you have to do is stick an empty text file named ""disable"" in the closed directory. It's super easy. You can do that in TWRP."

Nothing. Apparently I lost 2 years worth of phone data, which no amount of money can bring back.

xposed,3a5yzw,lightslightup,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Use Titanium Backup, backup data for latest snapchat release while logged in (data only).   When the backup's complete, delete snapchat and install 9.3.1 from a downloaded apk.  Don't try to login. Go to titanium backup, find snapchat, press 'restore'. Be sure to select 'data only'.  Once that's done, you should be logged in when you open 9.3.1.  Oh, and make sure to disable auto update on the play store.  Should be golden after that. None of the other methods I've seen worked for me. After fooling around for a couple of hours last night, I came up with this and it's been working like a charm on all my devices (Kitkat + Lollipop).

I'm on OpenVPN Connect with CyanogenMod 11s (4.4.4 based), and the notification I get can be blocked with NotifyClean on the process ""Android System"" -> ""VPN is activated by OpenVPN Connect"".  Edit: Or are you using the built-in VPN functionality? In that case I strongly recommend switching to a client-based VPN, since the standards supported (L2TP/IPSec and PPTP) are considered to be flawed - check https://www.ivpn.net/pptp-vs-l2tp-vs-openvpn.  The best clients for OpenVPN are either OpenVPN Connect (no root) or OpenVPN (root) - both are based on the same open source tool and work with all third-party VPN servers supporting the standard. Check /r/VPN for recommendations and /r/vpncoupons for deals!"

xposed,39tco4,mistermojorizin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:10:43 2015 UTC,GravityBox just removes notification icons but NotifyClean removes the messages shown by those apps too.
xposed,39tco4,forthewin0,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:51:05 2015 UTC,"In gravity box too, I don't see the msg in notification shade anymore. For example, I hid the Tasker notification. I now have neither the notification in shade nor the icon in statusbar. Tasker service is still running."
xposed,39tco4,mistermojorizin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"I have NC and GBox. I like controlling my notifications in very meticulous ways. For example, my weather app, I want it to show me a notification when the wind is in double digits, but no other notifications. With GB I kept having other ones slip through, and it was a constant battle of seeing which ones were tracked by GB and blocking them. In NC it's very easy, there's tons more options, and you can use regx to create rules for notification header and content. EDIT: also easy to control what you see - the icon in status bar vs the notification message in the drop down - either one or both.  I can't comment re the lollipop UI"
xposed,39tco4,Hydrox6,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Actually all of them just updated yesterday to 3.5. Defim seems to push updates to the Xposed Repository for all of his modules at the same time, which is probably why they appear on the play store first."

xposed,39vwtw,dirtpuddle,2,Mon Jun 15 20:25:52 2015 UTC,I am.  In fact this is a Sony Rom thing ever since the Jellybean or even before. The problem is that the notification originated from the phone app and blocking its notification for this will block all other phone related notification such as missed calls.
xposed,39vwtw,forthewin0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:17:49 2015 UTC,"You mean the popup?  Enhanced Toast, then you can selectively block which notifications can pop up or not."

It doesn't help that the web client and app for it is now full of adds and useless content (in my opinion)"
xposed,39yt9v,ArtyBen,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:22:30 2015 UTC,New to reddit so didn't we redditors hate 9GaG but yeah it is like you said most of the posts in 9GaG are stolen from reddit.  Btw Adaway is the perfect solution for pesky ads
xposed,39yt9v,ArtyBen,2,Tue Jun 16 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, it wasn't like ads as such that I meant I just couldn't think of the right word (I use a combo of a few ad blockers on my phone, and it works wonders) I meant like them advertising their own content (?) like ""Check this out"" and stuff like that. I haven't used the app in a while now though, but mainly because it has become so bloated for basically an image browser."
xposed,39yt9v,ArtyBen,2,Tue Jun 16 12:40:43 2015 UTC,I use amplify + xPrivacy to remove wakelocks and revoke permissions for all such apps. Facebook app was the biggest bitch (Batter and performance wise) but now its as tame as a kitten Google play services the biggest curse on android has been tamed to quite an extent by revoking most permissions and wake locks (one use it because alot of apps I use dont work without it)  And yeah you're right it super annoying them advertising their own content wish adblock worked for that too ;)
xposed,39yt9v,ArtyBen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"I've just started using xPrivacy for this kind of stuff, but thank you,I was literally just going through blocking wake locks and I just remembered I need to do all of Facebooks also."

I can't wipe the data obviously, as then I would be unable to login anymore, so I have no other solution than waiting for the module to be updated.

xposed,395o3c,Endda,3,Tue Jun 9 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"I can't write it, but I think that there would be benefits to having more control over the navigation bar when Expanded Desktop is enabled. Such as:  1) always show with keyboard / require swipe to show with keyboard 2) show on right side (exists on small screen devices, not large) / show on left side (exists on small screen devices, not large) / show on bottom (exists and only option on large screen devices, not small) 3) show with swipe / show with quick toggle  I also put in a feature request for this to CyanogenMod. Vote! https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/browse/CYAN-6636  Some of this could be implemented in other ways, such as separating settings for the navigation bar from settings for the notification bar. Quick toggles for each, More robust settings. Etc.  Now my selfish reasons for wanting this use case.  I use a root pie control that replaces all of the functions of the navigation bar. This is my preferred method of navigating 99%+ of the time. Rarely, but sometimes, this pie crashes and I need to be able bring up the native navigation bar. Also, the cursor control for text fields in the CM navigation bar is very useful at times.  CM10 was great. Expanded desktop mode, accessible through a notification drawer toggle, could be used quickly and from any screen turn the expanded mode on or off. AOSP KitKat brought a native way to hide the navigation bar that involved swiping from the bottom or side, based on device and current orientation, to bring up the navigation bar and CM11 adopted this. This is a solid implementation for those who primarily use the native navigation bar and want to hide it at times.  For folks who primarily use a pie control for navigation, or other alternative, this implementation stole a side from which swiping could activate the pie. So I disabled the navigation bar entirely through build.prop. This is hacky, the native navigation bar could never be accessed, and if the pie control were to crash the device would need to be restarted.  So far with CM12, there are no changes to this feature and the quick toggle has been removed or not yet implemented, although the feature can still be toggled through the power button menu."

xposed,38mgls,SabashChandraBose,2,Fri Jun 5 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"This is definitely overkill for your needs, but I just saw a new module called TextInject.  You can use Tasker to create custom variables (like the time in another timezone) and then use the xposed module to insert it into the statusbar.  Have you checked gravitybox to see if it includes this option?  I can't really install it to check.  Another thing you can try (but isn't exactly what you want) is this: http://android.wonderhowto.com/how-to/add-custom-widgets-lock-screen-android-lollipop-0162069/  Basically, there's an app that lets you put widgets as a notification.  So you could add your clocks there and check them with a quick swipe to your notification panel.  I couldn't find a better solution."

xposed,38k4dw,SnowGabe,6,Thu Jun 4 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"It's very bare bones out of the box, it only limits a couple services, when most of the high wake lock services aren't selected by default.   In short, don't install it and think you will experience an improvement without tweaking it."
xposed,38k4dw,geoff5093,3,Thu Jun 4 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"In short, don't install it and think you will experience an improvement without tweaking it.   Well now I'm confused because they claim the exact opposite."
xposed,38k4dw,wrekone,4,Thu Jun 4 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to understand, they start with only 2-4 services amplified, when I end up amplifying around 20-25, and even then it's a modest improvement at best."
xposed,38k4dw,geoff5093,2,Fri Jun 5 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"But it is hard to understand. Are you wrong or are they lying? Obviously you're not going to think you're wrong, but you can't both be right. Services and wakelocks are not exactly user friendly territory, even with the descriptions provided in Amplify. Am I to assume that you know what you're talking about and the developers don't, because I sure as heck don't know enough to fact check either of you."
xposed,38k4dw,wrekone,2,Fri Jun 5 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"You sure can by using Betterbatterystats, which is very popular. Without Amplify, all wakelocks are up. With Amplify default, nlp wakelocks are reduced and they are the major one on most devices. BBS shows you which wakelocks that keep your device from sleeping and how your deepsleep period increases over time as you start amplifying more.  Reducing NLP wakelocks will help a lot if you use Google apps a lot. As on my phone, NLP is not among the major wakelocks. It really comes down to which apps you have on your device as the effect of Amplify can vary from marginal to substantial.  P/S: about using Amplify, it's dead easy. Just avoid Android core wakelocks and you can go wild amplifying without worrying you will brick your device."
xposed,38k4dw,lucasho23121,2,Fri Jun 5 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"Since a couple are selected by default, technically there is a slight improvement. It seems more difficult than it is, amplify shows you the number of wake lock and how long it kept your device awake. When looking through this list, a siple Google search of that service will tell you if it's needed or not.   I good rule of thumb is that most play services and location services are okay to amplify. Don't disable the service, just alarms and wake locks."
xposed,38k4dw,geoff5093,3,Fri Jun 5 09:45:16 2015 UTC,what is amplify and what are you amplifying
xposed,38k4dw,creed10,2,Fri Jun 5 03:40:12 2015 UTC,http://www.amplifyandroid.com/
xposed,38k4dw,wrekone,2,Fri Jun 5 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"Afaik, by default it limits google's nlp service which is related to location gathering related wakelocks; which is one of the worst culprit of battery drain. Any further modification requires you to make a donation. After that, you can limit other services."
xposed,38k4dw,iWizardB,2,Fri Jun 5 05:18:16 2015 UTC,That's not true. Try to disable / limit ANY service / wakelock which Amplify hasn't done by default and you'll get this popup.
xposed,38k4dw,iWizardB,2,Sat Jun 6 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"Again wrong. The above screenshot shows the popup I got when trying to limit a ""safe to limit"" wakelock. Launch Amplify and scroll to the bottom of main screen where the donation details are given. It tells you what's free and what's not."
xposed,38k4dw,iWizardB,-1,Sat Jun 6 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my mistake, I forgot I had donated a while back"
xposed,38k4dw,geoff5093,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it limits 2 wakelocks and 2 alarms in the free version, I believe. Use a 3rd party app like Wakelock Detector to see what wakelocks are eating up your battery then decide if it's worth it to donate.  If you're not sure what to amplify, visit the xda thread and the spreadsheet in the OP."
xposed,38k4dw,CRASHINO_HUNK,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:52:49 2015 UTC,Yeah its automatic unless you want to edit more with the donation package or have issues with the standard settings.

As far as conflicting modules go.  I have all of the same except Apm+ (functionality is in GB), FSK, and lollistat. None of those should cause an issue though.   This is what I did to troubleshoot my XGEL issue:   Disable all modules except XGEL don't reboot yet.  Back up settings and layout (i think this might be a paid feature)  Reset all XGEL settings and layout to default.  Rebooting  See if issue is still there (it shouldn't be). Restore all settings and layout. Most likely reboot is required depending on your settings.  If issue isn't there, enable other modules in groups or 1 by 1 till you see the conflict.  If issue is there see step 8. Remove all widgets and reboot. If still doesn't work. Reset all settings and enable again in groups until the issue is there.    My bet is that it is a setting or widget. Not a conflict. Let us know what the issue was when you fig it out"

However, there is an easier way of doing so. Because you have a Nexus 5, you can use the Nexus Root Toolkit to flash the 5.1.1 factory image in ""No Wipe"" mode. So it will replace all of your system files, but all of your apps and data will be maintained!  After doing this, just reroot and install a custom recovery. Then flash the 5.1.1 Xposed zip."
xposed,3881ek,forthewin0,2,Tue Jun 2 16:53:11 2015 UTC,I'd say your best bet would be flashing a 5.1.1 image from google and reinstalling xposed.

xposed,3881ek,geoff5093,0,Tue Jun 2 15:15:19 2015 UTC,I knew it wouldn't work I kinda just hoped. I wasn't sure if there was an easier way to do it than flashing it and reinstalling it so I was checking. No harm in that.
xposed,3881ek,strader45,2,Tue Jun 2 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"Replace the recovery with stock recovery, then do a permanent unroot, and then the OTA link should work"
xposed,3881ek,lahirutarz,2,Tue Jun 2 16:25:47 2015 UTC,No it won't. You can't uninstall xposed. The easiest method is downloading the factory image and flashing  without wipe.

xposed,37iti9,forthewin0,2,Thu May 28 12:02:53 2015 UTC,"This would be a better question for r/androidquestions, but we can help too!  First, make sure you understand the steps you need to root. One of the first steps will be to ""Unlock the bootloader"". Basically, this allows you to modify system, radio, recovery, and boot partitions on your phone. Read up on this by doing a quick google search.  Now for the recovery part: All android phones come with a recovery option. When your S5 is powered off, hold the volume up, home, and power buttons. However, the stock recovery that comes with most phones is pretty crappy, so there are custom recoveries. To install these, you need an unlocked bootloader (which is why you should read up on that). I would recommend installing TWRP.  This leads to my main point: Using TWRP, you can create a ""Nandroid Backup"". This is basically a full system image, and if something goes wrong, you can just restore this.  All of that being said, usually nothing will go wrong just from rooting your phone. There is no option to launch in a root-disabled mode, but you can easily disable root by booting into TWRP and deleting a few files."

Download the 5.1.1 factory image to your computer and extract the .tgz. Edit the flash-all.bat file and remove the -w from it, if you don't want to wipe all data from your phone. Save the file.

Rather than needing to call in to check your voicemail it will pop up in your hangouts app and will transcribe the message for you (it gets it about 50% accurate but its enough to get an idea of what the message is about lol) and then you have visual voicemail you can check from any of your devices.

xposed,37f42k,effingsteam,1 point,Wed May 27 15:22:58 2015 UTC,You will need to go to the webpage as well and then set up call forwarding. Www.google.com/voice and go through the setup then open the google voice app to change it over to using google voice for voicemail on your phone and you are set. It takes maybe 5 minutes to get all set up.

xposed,37astf,IamTheAsian,3,Tue May 26 06:38:14 2015 UTC,"I posted a comment the other day saying the same thing, and /u/GossipGoot provided a great tip for making it work:  Basically, install the newest version from the Play Store and sign into it. Use Titanium Backup to backup your data for it, then uninstall Snapchat and reinstall the 9.3.1.0 Beta version. It won't let you sign in, but if you restore just your data from Titanium Backup, you'll be signed back in and SnapPrefs will be working again. It's been working for me, and I'm on a CyanogenMod-based 5.1 ROM.  I also take the extra step and detach Snapchat from the Play Store using Titanium to avoid automatic updates; however, I've noticed this doesn't stick after a reboot, so I have to always go back in and detach it from the Play Store each time I restart my phone.  I hope that works for you!"

Let's say you're outdoor, taking a picture of the garden and there's a small shelter in the background for example. It isn't much lightened but you would like it to be also part of the picture, HDR will produce a clear picture from both your flowers and the interior of the shelter. Instead of adjusting luminosity to get or an over exposed picture with a view in the shelter, or an under exposed picture from your flowers and can't clearly see what's in the shelter. It also helps as a ""night mode"" as to reduce the noise from lack of luminosity without needing the flash."

Just install busybox restart, and it will work."

xposed,34ymqa,effingsteam,1 point,Tue May 5 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly concerned about the overlapping areas. If I run into an issue with one of those overlapping areas, my troubleshooting efforts have doubled having to check both modules.   But that is a minor concern. I'm sure the two generally play together just fine or there would have been user posts if they didn't. I just find it odd there is no other Xposed module that performs this function."
xposed,34ymqa,effingsteam,2,Tue May 5 21:52:31 2015 UTC,They really work perfect together. I would be shocked if you ever had an issue because of overlapping especially if you just used xgels to remove the search bar and nothing else.

I use Hangouts messaging all the time and the merged convos are nice but it's just so slow. Behind the scenes there is a lot of code to sort through and it's a decently complicated app. That may explain the sluggishness to some degree.  I should add that porting XHangouts isn't technically possible since I imagine the two are just different enough behind the scenes that I'd have to essentially reanalyze the entire codebase. In this case a ""port"" would be more like a ""complete rewrite but with the same features."" MMS APN Splicing, for instance, took literal and complete days to implement.

XDA is a very large community and as it has grown it seems like the user to developer ratio has become increasingly unbalanced. And ""users"" in their entirety aren't the issue but rather community members who would barely qualify as technically literate, attempting to do things far over their head. There are a number of ways to clean things up (like letting OPs meeting certain requirements moderate their own threads) but I'm far too new and inactive in the community to have an opinion with sufficient merit.  Edit: Perhaps a better ratio (instead of developer to ""user"") is developer/power user to technically illiterate. I hesitate to say newbie since they can still be technically minded."

xposed,347bri,dashrandom,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"Custom kernel and trickster mod. I do not think an xposed mod will be able to do this as this is a kernel wide setting, not something that can be configured on a per app basis."
xposed,347bri,ttonyp,2,Wed Apr 29 01:50:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The phone can definitely request different vibration patterns and durations in user space which the kernel will just deliver. Actually limiting it in kernel space is a hack, albeit quite useful."

xposed,347bri,dashrandom,1 point,Mon May 4 15:48:30 2015 UTC,Not at the moment as I'm spending the spare time I got for other development projects. But it might be something interesting to explore at some point.
xposed,347bri,dashrandom,1 point,Mon May 4 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"Can you tell me exactly where the setting would be in TricksterMOD?  I tried it with my current SlimKat ROM(which does have the setting), and I couldn't find an option for it.  If the setting can be built into the SlimKat ROM without changes to the kernel, an Xposed module should be able to do it too.  Someone just needs to go examine SlimKat's source and see how they did it."
xposed,347bri,DarkFlasher,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"You can tweak the ""vibrator strength"" with trickster if the kernel allows for it. As for the duration... I customized mine with swiftkey and lightflow."

xposed,346jqq,forthewin0,3,Tue Apr 28 22:20:52 2015 UTC,Having the NotifyClean module active blocks Pushbullet from sending notifications to a PC. You can see more about it and read logs here and here.
xposed,348xar,hanotw,2,Wed Apr 29 06:03:31 2015 UTC,You certainly didn't brick it if it still shows signs of life...

xposed,342dxd,ttonyp,8,Tue Apr 28 02:36:50 2015 UTC,Wow an immediate response from the developer himself! To be honest I was freeloading to get the icon cause I only use the module on my tablet and barely at that so I didn't think 3$ was worth it.. Going to donate right now! Thanks!
xposed,342dxd,ttonyp,8,Tue Apr 28 03:00:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's truly appreciated :)  Yes, I do see the pro version as a donate option, as you can get all features without paying.   I made this on purpose and I don't have a problem with people not paying - it's better you use my officially supported version than a cracked file from shady websites which potentially harms your device or steals privacy information. Additionally there are people who simply can't afford it or due to regional restrictions can't purchase it.   Reactions like yours show that I can still generate some revenue by this approach, which is nice to see."
xposed,342dxd,ttonyp,2,Tue Apr 28 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"I would maybe suggest changing the initial amount to $1. Had it been just a dollar I would have donated immediately without hesitating. Not sure if it makes more in the long run though, just my thoughts."
xposed,342dxd,Goliath27,3,Tue Apr 28 03:23:50 2015 UTC,"I considered that, but it doesn't really work the way Google takes it's cuts. Apart from their normal 30% cut Google Wallet charges currency conversion fees which quite often (depending on the currency) include a fixed amount. This makes too low prices less useful.   Additionally I think if someone really appreciates the functionality of the app 3 bucks seem fair, at least that's a price I'm fine with when I buy other people's apps."

xposed,342dxd,_kissmyaxe_,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:43:15 2015 UTC,Thought the modules had to be updated for 5.1. Thanks for the explanation :-)
xposed,342dxd,_kissmyaxe_,2,Tue Apr 28 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, that as well of course. This depends a lot on the individual modules, if you're hooking a system function that changed from Android 5.0 to 5.1 you need to update your modules.   My module indeed needed quite some updates for 5.1. In version 2.1 (in the beta channel) I added theoretical support for Android 5.1. Unfortunately I don't know yet if it does fully work, as the module now bootloops - same thing as apps like Gravitybox.   But these bootloops aren't the modules fault, they're using basic API functions provided by Xposed which suddenly (in 5.1) leads to a bootloop."

If XposedBridge.jar has version 64 after a reboot, the new version is active. Changes: - Fixed issues with replacing drawables - Fixed NoSuchMethodError in handleInitPackageResources - Possibly fixed some errors on ROMs that start in permissive SELinux mode and switch to enforcing mode later  As the question probably comes up: - No, this version doesn't support Android 5.1 yet. - No, this ZIP doesn't support arm64/x86 processors yet. I will eventually support them as well, but as there are unofficial versions for these, I try to work on a few known issues for Android 5.0 before (when I find time for it).

xposed,33nisi,npjohnson1,3,Fri Apr 24 00:45:10 2015 UTC,"A nice feature might be to download the package that corresponds to your API version. As of now, XPOSED just says ""must be installed through recovery"", when in reality, it could realize your API version, download the correct file, detect if you have a custom recovery, and if you do, push the downloaded .zip to /tmp and echo the command to flash the zip to the recovery log, then reboot to recovery.  EDIT: PM me if you are interested and need help/don't know how to interact with recovery, etc.  Double EDIT: Note to all, this app cannot be installed as an update to the current XPOSED app, you will have to uninstall the current XPOSED app, then install this one, then (likely) re-enable all your modules. The reason? The old app is signed with Rovo89's Signature/Certificate, and, as per Android's restrictions, no app that is signed with a different identity than the original app will install over (as an update to) the original app. This is why modified apk's don't get along with Google Play updates, this commonly comes through to users as ""Invalid Package File"" error messages."

xposed,32vf3v,gamer765,2,Wed Apr 22 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Using my patcher, you get more options such as the ability to theme the Pandora launcher widget or theming the now playing screen in the Pandora app itself. Also you have the ability to download the song that is playing, although i've added that ability fairly recently in the patched Pandora apk as well, except you can't select the default save location, which is possible with the patcher. You can also get music in MP3 format in either 128 or 192kbps bitrate depending on your Pandora subscription status. I have not been able to do this in the apk since it causes Pandora to mysteriously crash, although the same mod via Xposed works just fine (some users report an error 3002 which I need to investigate into)."

xposed,32njkt,Hotspot3,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:12:53 2015 UTC,This is correct. IOS has one default SMS application that developers can hook into. The code of it is basically the same on any iPhone you use. Android on the other hand has dozens of different SMS applications that people use to replace the stock one. And even the stock one isnt the same stock one if you're running a skinned version of Android like touchwiz or sense. The code is different in each app and has to be hooked in very differently
xposed,32njkt,jax3rir,2,Sat Apr 18 02:21:13 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it's because multitasking works so well on most Android devices.

xposed,32lqc9,MixedWithFruit,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried OxygenOS, but if it is anything like CM12 or 12.1, you should do the following for it to work:  1-Change your SELinux from the default 'Enforced' to 'Permissive'. This can be done through an app called SELinux Mode Changer, or through a command in the terminal app. 2-Flash the zip in recovery. (there is an unofficial zip for 5.1 which runs well for me so far) 3- Install the alpha framework apk  Hope this helps."
xposed,32lygh,Sevenanths,3,Tue Apr 14 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"Don't know if this works, but if you're on kitkat try this http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.mods.appsettings once installed, open it and find viber, enable, set DPI to maybe 320 and you can also try using xlarge and see if that helps.  this would allow you to change vibers layout/DPI without messing with the phones."

xposed,32j75k,notentirelynormal,4,Tue Apr 14 05:36:22 2015 UTC,"When I upgraded from CM11 to CM12 (not CM12S, mind), I'm pretty sure I didn't uninstall Xposed beforehand.  The flash to lollipop made old Xposed stop working; from that point, I installed the newest Xposed installer apk from the XDA thread and flashed Xposed in recovery.  If you're really worried, you should be able to deactivate Xposed on KitKat through the installer through the one-click deactivate, but you shouldn't need to remove any installed modules.  Well, if you use App Settings, you have to uninstall the old version before reinstalling it because apparently rovo lost the key used to sign it.  But that's the exception."
xposed,32j75k,bluezero4,2,Tue Apr 14 06:24:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.   So, you didn't deactivate KitKat xposed before going to CM12? Also, do my currently installed modules show up on Lollipop xposed even if they don't work?"
xposed,32j75k,bluezero4,3,Tue Apr 14 06:28:40 2015 UTC,"It's been a while; didn't make a point to remember.  My assumption is that whatever part of /system that Xposed lives in just gets overwritten without any hassle.  Greenify, for example, stayed installed, and the module stayed checked.  However, when I opened the Greenify app, it said Xposed want installed.  Nothing was greyed out because of incompatibility.  If you have a module that might break your system like KitKat GravityBox, I would definitely disable it before trying to flash Xposed to /system.  Although for GravityBox specifically, you'd want to uninstall the KitKat version and reinstall the lollipop version.  Not to assume you use it, of course.  Basically, I would make a point to make a nandroid backup in recovery before upgrading to lollipop and before flashing Xposed.  If something goes wrong, you're going to need that backup.  For me, I got stuck in a bootloop when flashing Xposed because /system got full after flashing lollipop.  I uninstalled a few of the apps from Gapps (like YouTube) using SD Maid and reinstalled from the play store, and that was enough to fix it.  I really had to have backups during that process."

With Power Nap, you don't really need to disable auto-sync either, unless you want to make sure absolutely no extra battery is being used while the screen is on (which will be dealt with once low battery mode is implemented).

Since the app is no longer active, it cannot wake the phone.  The keypoint here is that the apps are still active but blocked in Stamina Mode; but for Greenify the apps are killed.

xposed,31wz0l,funeralcrow,4,Wed Apr 8 21:04:41 2015 UTC,Xposed will eventually be ported to work with TW ROMs. But what worries me most is how Rovo and the other devs are having a hard time updating Xposed for 5.1+ ROMs. There are a lot of changes to ART in 5.1. One can only imagine how bad it will be when Sammy starts pushing out their 5.1 ROMs...

xposed,31wz0l,gus2155,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:12:17 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. It worked great from the first alpha build, and then just stopped working after an update flash. It's odd too, inside the exposed app it says 60 of 61 app_processes are working, which led me to believe that one of the hooks got tampered with, kind of  similar to the reason Touchwiz ROMs are not working... I'll have to look into it further. Thanks."

xposed,31qdpc,bleblub,2,Tue Apr 7 13:25:07 2015 UTC,I believe it has something to do with the improved security of Lollipop with SELinux. The flash files might overwrite some settingfiles for SELinux.

And it hasn't stopped working yet, and I still don't have the module installed.   It seems like the app just checks once and that's it. Once it detects it's on a tablet, it stays that way.

Users who only use Xposed are far less likely to damage their phone by downloading something that say, wasn't made for their device."
xposed,2zxihv,hitarth1605,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:58:08 2015 UTC,"Good thinking, we definitely don't want to be accountable for that sort of stuff. Well, one less thing to code I guess :)"
xposed,2zxihv,StillPersonal,5,Mon Mar 23 01:06:22 2015 UTC,I think it would be better to keep the fundamental parts of the ROM and the surface level things like xposed separate. Thank you for opening up the dialogue about this.
xposed,2zxihv,maxido,2,Mon Mar 23 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I think just having separate sections of the app, maybe swappable via the material drawer on the left with different coloration and a warning asking not to use any files without the knowledge that 1. It may not be functional without boot unlocking or other products and 2. There must be a warning. Either way it's a wonderful idea!"
xposed,2zxihv,GermainZ,3,Tue Mar 24 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a good idea, maybe we'll just do that."
xposed,2zxihv,maxido,2,Tue Mar 24 19:26:15 2015 UTC,"Cool :) also a question, would you consider contacting the devs of xposed on automatic integration or module installation thru the store app?"
xposed,2zxihv,GermainZ,5,Tue Mar 24 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"Since Xposed is open source, we may not even need Rovo's permission."
xposed,2zxihv,balla21,2,Tue Mar 24 20:42:51 2015 UTC,Your thoughts and thinking is great go on bro
xposed,2zxihv,maxido,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:55:38 2015 UTC,So are you also wanting to implement some sort of ROM Manager as well?
xposed,2zxihv,pohui,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:59:09 2015 UTC,But cydia is decentralised so quite the opposit in that regard.
xposed,2zxihv,pohui,2,Sun Mar 22 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"Same with Xposed in theory, it's just not exposed to the user (yet?). Using a custom repo is relatively easy, you just setup a server to return the requested data (the format is simple enough) and change a URL in the source code."
xposed,2zxihv,Luckzzz,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't know that, but that's still centralised. No one is gonna recompile Xposed(user) also multiple sources would be nice."
xposed,2zxihv,GermainZ,2,Mon Mar 23 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yup, just pointing out that it's made to be easily decentralized. You won't have to remake it all from scratch, and it's pretty easy if there's demand."
xposed,2zxihv,LazyCouchPotato,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:53:19 2015 UTC,How so? Care to explain?
xposed,2zxihv,enlightened-giraffe,2,Mon Mar 23 00:56:18 2015 UTC,"Cydia is a package manager, like the linux apt system. There are sources, which can be added to cydia and that's where the tweaks are. Sure there are 3 or so default sources but you can remove them anytime or add your own."
xposed,2zxihv,parineum,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:07:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I was thinking we could make this decentralized as well. A few official/default repos and the ability to create your own. Some dedicated to themes, some to root stuff, some to modules, etc."
xposed,2zxihv,PiggehPerson,2,Sun Mar 22 20:54:37 2015 UTC,You can add repositories in Aptoide and F-Droid.
xposed,2zxihv,justfarmingdownvotes,0,Sun Mar 22 22:07:35 2015 UTC,"I thought about that, but I think in order to get this right we need to either make our own, or modify either apk (we'd most likely need permission)"
xposed,2zxihv,Oirammario12345,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:09:01 2015 UTC,Both are open source.
xposed,2zxihv,sm2016,0,Sun Mar 22 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, then it's possible. But still, I think it would be better if we made our own. I would only be satisfied if we heavily modified either one. It could work though."
xposed,2zxihv,teddman123,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:29:45 2015 UTC,I never use Aptoide as it has a lot of ads. I download apk from google....  Xposed is completely free =)
xposed,2zxihv,Minnesota_Winter,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"The Xposed installer app is made in such a way changing the repo or adding custom user repos is simple enough. It's literally just a URL you have to change in the source, and the format of the file is simple enough.  (Have you tried looking at the source code? I'd advise you to start there instead of making your own app from scratch, as you seem to have indicated elsewhere.)"
xposed,2zxihv,StillPersonal,2,Mon Mar 23 12:30:56 2015 UTC,There is a Material Design Xposed 3.0 Alpha 1 mod. Couldn't find an Alpha 2 mod though.
xposed,2zxihv,WonderedFidelity,10,Tue Mar 24 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"Really ? You wouldn't want some basic store functionality like :   Filter by compatibility (Android version) Filter by OEM-exclusive (tons of stuff only for HTC or Samsung or Sony phones) Rating and comments Proper goddamn search Categories   Right now it's a basic repository, which is understandable given that it's niche and has no backing as a platform, but it's absurd to say there aren't things that would greatly improve the experience"
xposed,2zxihv,balla21,4,Mon Mar 23 11:59:33 2015 UTC,"The first two, IMO, are a major issue. There are a lot of possible 'nice to haves' but those two things are necessities."
xposed,2zxihv,starscream92,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think the simplest thing to do would be to add those features to the Download section of the Xposed Installer, or maybe a new tool that accesses the existing Xposed repo."
xposed,2zxihv,gandador,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"I'd say we'll most likely implement every single one if those features, including a beautiful design, if you count that as a feature (I do)."
xposed,2zxihv,licguzman,59,Mon Mar 23 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"App discovery, top charts, categories, maybe even more than just modules - like themes. The sky is the limit. I'll be making some mockups, I think actually seeing how it would work would help."
xposed,2zxihv,chickmagnet3,20,Sun Mar 22 19:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yeaas please.   The lack of this is the reason that deters me from finding new modules.   Its just one big long list, you don't know which ones support what phones or android versions, you don't know what you're looking for because you're discovering so search is useless.   Please make"
xposed,2zxihv,robochicken11,4,Sun Mar 22 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's just a huge list of modules, with no way to find something you're interested in unless you already know what it is."
xposed,2zxihv,MKGirl,3,Mon Mar 23 10:57:55 2015 UTC,The thing that keeps me interested in jailbreaking is finding new things to do. I rarely look for something I already know I want.
xposed,2zxihv,lolportal2,3,Tue Mar 24 16:42:33 2015 UTC,Yes! Most popular etc would be good.
xposed,2zxihv,CamKeys45,2,Mon Mar 23 16:42:30 2015 UTC,It would be very similar to Cydia with all customization options and addons in one place.
xposed,2zxihv,gobig89,2,Mon Mar 23 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"You are right that it works, but for example, I don't like having to go to each app's page to update it. I would rather have some sort of auto-update or cumulative update feature."
xposed,2zxihv,tackleberry61,1 point,Mon Mar 23 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"If this was like Cydia then you could charge for modules more easily, a definite advantage over current download methods."
xposed,2zxihv,itgn,0,Sun Mar 22 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"You're right, it would be more incentive for devs to make great modules."
xposed,2zxihv,ExaPaw,1 point,Mon Mar 23 10:45:52 2015 UTC,"Something like flex, just another forum or whatever to get tweaks"
xposed,2zxihv,robochicken11,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"There's a whole list, apparently. I agree with that list. It'll also attract more attention to the whole community.   Good no?"

xposed,2zxihv,chudapati09,2,Mon Mar 23 16:05:27 2015 UTC,Or we could find a way to integrate the Xposed installer into our app.
xposed,2zxihv,ThePixelHunter,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:11:19 2015 UTC,"I can see how that would work but I don't know if the devs would like it - at that point, their app is completely irrelevant?"

xposed,2zy7ip,Eagle1337,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:27:10 2015 UTC,"Greenify has not been updated, so it will not work and this is normal. As for Wakelock Terminator, I'm not sure if that has been updated either.  If you installed the latest version of Xposed, you should see the numbers 61 and 62 in the framework section. If keepchat is working, then you probably installed it right, but just make sure."

xposed,2zpz4l,Holl0wHeart,-7,Thu Mar 26 16:51:08 2015 UTC,I guess Yahoo!'s ads are too intrusive for them to be paid for building an app that people use.  Okay.
xposed,2zpz4l,ard0,3,Fri Apr 24 16:40:05 2015 UTC,Then don't use it. How is this any worse than adfree or ad block plus on PCs?
xposed,2zpz4l,Smb158,-6,Fri Mar 20 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the downvote.  I have 2 points:  1) I also generally disagree with users who use AdBlock or Adfree with it's default settings, every ad blocked.  That's most people.  This is different, because the author is saying ""Yahoo!'s ads are intrusive. I don't want to see them, but not so much that I'm willing to use a different app."" Which brings me to point number two.  2) Cant the same thing be said for users who don't like ads?  If you don't want them, don't use apps that have ads in them.  Since no one seems to like it when apps or websites support themselves with ads, what's a good alternative?  Would you like paywalls?  Would you like modular content the requires a subscription?  Would you like your ISP to decide which content you can see?  If you want things on the internet to be free, but don't want ads, then you let's hear a viable alternative.  And please don't say ""Well, if no one wants to pay for them, they'll just die off, so what."""
xposed,2zpz4l,ard0,8,Fri Mar 20 21:01:34 2015 UTC,I didn't down vote you. I just really don't care. Almost no one is going to end up using this module and I don't think it will have any effect on yahoo at all.

xposed,2ziap7,KillerBeeSting,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:37:39 2015 UTC,Lolistat has some glaring obvious issues. One being Gmail. It paints the nav bar white with white icons...uh. On Reddit Sync it paints it as they with white icons. It should be red on Gmail and blue on Reddit Sync. After blacklisting them and a reboot it doesn't respect the blacklist and still paints wrongly. I have literally only opened those two apps since I installed it.  I'll try a few more but I'm sure bugs are abound.  Not to mention that it doesn't paint the nav bar the same color as the keyboard OR maintain the color of the status bar. It reverts to lack until the keyboard is dismissed. Cool concept. But too many inconsistencies.  Furthermore in New stand its blue. The status bar is black...seems wherever it pulls its values from to match are not reliable enough to have a consistent look and feel.

Some of my apps generate an unseemly number of toasts, and I'd prefer not to have them all show up as notifications. Yet the notifications that they generate are actually useful, so I don't want to block them and not receive anything."
xposed,2ze5yz,matkv,2,Tue Mar 17 21:43:28 2015 UTC,If the toasts you don't like are superuser toasts you could individually block them in the superuser app
xposed,2ze5yz,GoogleIsYourFrenemy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"I have no root issues. I have issues with other apps. I've actually used enhanced toast in the past to block specific toasts from apps like Idle Miner, but there's other apps that generate toasts, and I would really prefer to be able to just check which specific apps I want toasts from on the computer. Like, say, an app that scans my sdcard and pops up a toast when it's done instead of a notification."
xposed,2ze5yz,GoogleIsYourFrenemy,3,Wed Mar 18 03:15:42 2015 UTC,EnhancedToast can filter toasts and pass them on to tasker.  AutoNotification can also capture toasts.  With tasker there is a pushbullet plugin.

xposed,2zcy0f,jcurtiswood,2,Wed Mar 18 00:08:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't help if the actual image URL is unique. Doesn't even need to be a physical image file as the web server can easily intercept any request for processing elsewise even if it looks like an image request. It'd be trivial to intercept something like my website.com/someGUID.jpg and track it.  It's somewhat helpful if they are stripping the referrer request header and/or faking user agent but doesn't prevent tracking the read.

Android has different services that run for different applications, if you go into your built in task manager you will be able to see that an app (e.g. Facebook) will be running its core application and then a few services. Will a new service be started when I cast content? Or is it something run by the system all the time? You may not even know which is fine. I tried Llama quickly and I could only choose user installed applications when trying to do what you said, is there a way to use system applications as variables?"

If you want something radically different for the notification bar, grab this:  http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.serajr.blurred.system.ui  And also get S5 UI and run it with that (if you're not on the S5). The result is this. This was my Note 3 on KitKat with S5 UI (hence the S5-like round toggles) and that blurring module. I removed a lot of stuff (toggle labels, handle bar on the bottom) with WanamXposed and then enabled the blurring module.

xposed,2ypad9,lalalude,2,Thu Mar 12 02:07:13 2015 UTC,Most options require a restart of Hangouts with the notable exception of MMS quality settings. The easiest way to do this is close it via swiping away on the app switcher. Make certain you've enabled the desired settings in the XHangouts settings app beforehand.
xposed,2ypad9,jeffAA,9,Thu Mar 12 03:11:26 2015 UTC,I'll definitely give this a shot when he updates the module for Hangouts 3.0.

xposed,2ypad9,Xianyong667,5,Wed Mar 11 18:52:32 2015 UTC,Make the whole app a black theme and you would have a winner! Currently using Team Blackout's modded hangouts for this.

xposed,2ypqsc,sfcpfc,3,Fri Mar 13 05:15:38 2015 UTC,Anyone running 5.1: do you think it's worth updating or do you recommend waiting for Xposed?
xposed,2ypqsc,mstrmanager,3,Thu Mar 12 15:42:08 2015 UTC,I upgraded about an hour after the images were posted. Battery life is a bit better on my Nexus 5 and everything is smooth. I think it's worth it. All I really miss is quick pull down on the top right and per app DPI from Cataclysm. The dev will likely update his ROM with 5.1 quite soon though.
xposed,2ypqsc,amanitus,2,Thu Mar 12 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"My battery life is so much better.  I was one of those people who could get about 1.5 hours of screen on time during a charge, so this is huge for me.  I'm willing to go without xposed until someone gets it working."

xposed,2ypqsc,dontbeweakvato,-2,Wed Mar 11 23:51:59 2015 UTC,Ah I meant guess I'll wait for xposed to be supported on 5.1 before I make the jump to lollipop. Been waiting due to the memory leak bug. Was hoping xposed would not need a lot of work with 5.1.
xposed,2ypqsc,geekRD1,3,Thu Mar 12 00:08:38 2015 UTC,I had 5.0/5.01 with kernel and xposed. It worked fine.  I switched to 5.1 as soon as Google released the images. 5.1 is pretty badass smooth. (I mean it's real smooth). It's worth the update when without xposed.
xposed,2ypqsc,mstrmanager,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:17:22 2015 UTC,I'm just not willing to give up gravitybox. Once I can upgrade without the potential of the memory leak and keep gravitybox I will upgrade.
xposed,2ypqsc,geekRD1,2,Thu Mar 12 11:50:33 2015 UTC,Just wait until Cataclysm is updated. It has nearly everything you need in it.  Edit: there is already a beta available.
xposed,2ypqsc,mstrmanager,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:49:23 2015 UTC,I've not played around with cataclysm. does it feel/look like stock?
xposed,2ypqsc,geekRD1,2,Thu Mar 12 18:07:31 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much stock with tweaks built in. Plus you have the option to not install the Google bloat. I like this because I used to simply delete the folders in /system/app/ with solid explorer to remove the bloat.   Check out the 5.1 beta thread on xda. He explains essentially what it is. IMO, it's a better solution than gravity box."

Now that I'm on Lollipop, I haven't found an app that relays my GV messages to third party SMS apps, and hangouts does not have a feature like this built in. There is sort of a quick reply feature for hangouts in iOS, but it's terrible and more annoying than functional.  I rely on GV for multiple reasons and don't plan on porting my number because sometimes I switch carriers monthly. It depends on my needs.  When I used iMessage on my iPhone 5 for a week or so using my actual T-Mobile number I really liked the quick reply feature."

xposed,2yp2rt,admjwt,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:12:04 2015 UTC,Install Xposed with no enabled mods. Reboot (of course). If your phone runs correctly with just Xposed then Greenify is the problem. Also wipe your cache + dalvik after installing just for good measure.
xposed,2yp2rt,kmark937,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:31:27 2015 UTC,So install xposed before greenify then?
xposed,2yp2rt,kmark937,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:05:01 2015 UTC,Does Greenify have a listing in the Xposed Installer module settings? If so at least make certain this is disabled and then reboot. If Greenify does not then it is not interfacing with Xposed. And it would appear they're just incompatible together on Lollipop.
xposed,2yp2rt,kmark937,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"Okay I just went ahead and reinstalled it, I removed greenify and made sure there were no other modules installed at all. And it just doesn't work. Literally everything just crashes and makes it impossible to use. Could it be because of the rom? Does it work on just standard cm12?"
xposed,2yp2rt,whatjusthappened12,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"It could be a ROM issue. If you reflash the ROM, wipe dalvik and cache, but not wipe data (same process as upgrading) you should be left with a no-Xposed install. If things are back to normal then Xposed is definitely interfering in some way. Xposed replaces critical system files and it may be incompatible with that ROM. Upgrading/reinstalling the ROM will put them back.  Edit: It can confirm Xposed works pretty well on standard-ish CM12."
xposed,2yp2rt,dragonb2,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've reinstalled the ROM at least 7 times now because of the problems I'm having with xposed. I guess its just the ROM. I either need to use just standard cm12 or just stick with cm11s until closed works better. Thanks for the help though, at least now I know the problem."

Didn't wipe nothing didn't uninstall xposed, I just flashed 5.1 over 5.0.1 rom. Worked fine. Xposed installs as a sys file. So the 5.1 just flashed over it, negating xposed. Then I rerooted with supersu and flashed twrp. Everything is working like heaven."
xposed,2yq5x1,dontbeweakvato,0,Thu Mar 12 00:21:07 2015 UTC,Ok. Would the same happen if I installed 5.1 via OTA?
xposed,2yq5x1,nielsmannn,0,Thu Mar 12 00:26:49 2015 UTC,Should be the same. If any changes were made to sys or /sys I think the ota won't work. Xposed i think installs on sys. So It'll either work fine or do nothing.  But Just try it. Oh and always make a backup.

xposed,2ylbbx,kindall,5,Tue Mar 10 19:31:26 2015 UTC,Have you tried messaging the dev? He might be willing to upload a KitKat-only release to the repo as a separate module so any updates to the main release won't show up to you.

xposed,2ym4m0,emd2013,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:09:49 2015 UTC,Sounds like you want Titanium Backup
xposed,2ynfzi,Calvinized,3,Wed Mar 11 05:51:21 2015 UTC,Doesn't sound like a job for an Xposed module. Rather an app for converting gif to say mp4? Definitely a little more cumbersome than something that would do this automatically but making Xposed modules that interface directly with any closed-source app is an incredibly time consuming process. That is a large reason that even some seemingly simple requests are unlikely to ever be filled.
xposed,2ynfzi,kmark937,3,Wed Mar 11 10:25:55 2015 UTC,"I see. Well I am still pretty new to Android so I don't know much about the programming environment, but it makes sense. Too bad then :/"
xposed,2ynfzi,kmark937,3,Wed Mar 11 10:34:14 2015 UTC,Unfortunately modules that work inside closed-source apps need to be updated after every release of the app since most apps use a program that scrambles around the code every time. So in order to get an Xposed mod working and keep it working it requires constant attention. Not something you can make and then release and forget about.  On a positive note there are a bunch of gif to video apps for Android. I haven't used any of them so I can't speak for their effectiveness. Here's one.  I should add that developing Xposed modules is considerably different (and more volatile) than standard Android apps. So this isn't really a problem per-se with Android development but rather an unfortunate reality when doing cool things with Xposed you were never supposed to be able to do in the first place. ;)
xposed,2ynfzi,GoogleIsYourFrenemy,2,Wed Mar 11 10:41:10 2015 UTC,"I see. Never thought of that before. I have always thought that xposed module development is similar to those of android apps. Turns out it's not the case.  Yeah I have tried using that one, but the problem with that app is that it shows all gif files in the phone's memory in one continuous page without regards to the respective folders. Makes it difficult to find the intended gif when you have like hundreds of gif in your phone categorized neatly into various folders.  Thanks for the amazing reply btw! TIL :)"

xposed,2ykb12,dashrandom,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:57:18 2015 UTC,Gravitybox has its ultimate notification control which allows you to set a per-app vibration pattern. I found it doesn't quite work the way I want it to and have switched back to using the Play Store app Light Flow.
xposed,2ykb12,nielsmannn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:19:52 2015 UTC,I use App Ops. It allows you to kill vibration for an app if you want. You may have to wait until the app uses the vibration trigger before it shows up in the list of items you can turn off but it has saved me a lot of frustration. I specifically used it on Viber since there is no way I have found to kill the vibration within the app itself.

There was just a new release of SP (1.42). Try installing that and the latest SC(9.3.1.0). I know they work because I have them on my phone. You might also make sure you aren't running another module that might cause issues. I think some have said Amplify has caused issues.

It managed to boot up properly, but it had reset to Factory settings so no Apps, etc. I then flashed the backup because I hadn't updated my TitaniumBackup for my apps in a week, and fancied updating them before getting Xposed installed.  I am able to get into Fastboot and TWRP recovery mode.  Since I flashed the backup, I'm unable to boot up, regardless of whether I wipe data/cache/dalvik, etc, I've restored 2 backups I've made using Nandroid, and flashed the stock ROM that the OPO comes with(XNPH05Q) and nothing has let me boot up properly.  When I flash the backups, it restores more data than the size of the backup(right now, it says the backup size is 3900MB more or less, but it flashes over 8000MB of data).  Any suggestions for help would be great, as the only thing I can think of doing now is flashing the latest CM12 nightly and waiting for the Xposed uninstaller to come out...

xposed,2yapwz,SubNoize,25,Sun Mar 8 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"I thought you were over-reacting, but then I scrolled through the top posts for this subreddit and realized how big of a problem it is. Something probably should be done, to keep it from strangling the subreddit. They can be interesting topics, but a lot of them have the same problems: they already exist; there's already a way to do this with an app / Tasker; they're too superficial / trivial / specific to deserve a lot of attention; there are ROMs that do this and is therefore not a high priority.  A lot of these can be solved with a simple comment and don't need their own thread. Some of them can be interesting ideas and not easily solvable, but still require someone with the technical skill, free-time, and interest who happen to see them when they are trending on the subreddit. If nobody who meets those criteria sees it when it's hot, then it's not likely to get made. A thread or something which permanently collects these ideas would probably be more suitable.  I disagree with the new subreddit as OP mentions, since fracturing the community is rarely a good idea. I think the weekly megathread as /u/TTDTK mentions is a good one, and how a lot of subreddits handle this sort of overpopulation of a specific post type so the main subreddit can just be the flow of information rather than a brainstorming session.  Granted, there's two issues:   You don't want to over-moderate. That can cause problems with the people who have to actively moderate, or discontent from people who feel like they can't freely discuss. News posts, releases, and help posts are relatively few and far between. But when they do come, you want to be able to see them and not have them buried behind the newest ""suggestion"" post.   STill, I think the problems right now outweigh the issue with a Request Megathread. It wouldn't prevent people from their ideas (1) and the ""important"" information would be easier to see (2)."

My Greenify did that as well because the newest stable version wasn't quite compatible with Xposed. The newest version which works great with Xposed is 2.6 beta 1. You have to join the Google+ testing community to get further betas but you can grab 2.6 beta 1 online if you search for it as I did until that beta becomes stable and the Google Play version gets updated.   Just remember to download from Xposed, enable in Modules tab and then reboot from within Xposed.

xposed,2xtdta,shakuyi,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:54:22 2015 UTC,It works fine for me now; it seems you need to install the apk first and then flash the framework for it to work properly. No idea why though.
xposed,2xtdta,Firr84,2,Sun Mar 8 13:42:40 2015 UTC,Bit of a weird one this. I own a NEXUS 7 (2012 Wifi) running Android 5.0.2.  I had xposed framework installed and operational. Was running Gravitybox LP and a few other modules with no issue.  Then tried to install another mod and resulted in bootloop.  Did a complete fresh 5.0.2 flash and factory reset followed by reinstall of xposed framework which then resulted in a bootloop.  So I can confirm the N7 2012 does run Xposed and is stable but now I'm also trying to work out how to get it running properly again.  The only thing I noticed I did differently second time around is that after downloading the xposed .apk and .zip is that I installed the zip before aactually opening the apk.  Previously I opened apk which told me to flash the zip and then installed zip.  Maybe you have to open the apk first to 'control' zip or the zip corrupts boot?  The framework is running stable On my Nexus 5 (android 5.0.1).  Ill mess around with it some more today and report my results.  (Typing on my nexus 5 so apologies for any spelling errors etc).

xposed,2xpco7,cola5000,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:33:07 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I'm fairly new to Android and I discovered this module a few days ago and I'm in the same boat as you
xposed,2xpco7,joaopms,2,Mon Mar 2 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. Either try the second-to-latest version, or look on the XDA thread where the author posted a beta APK. Works great on my Nexus 6."

xposed,2xpco7,graesen,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:48:31 2015 UTC,I can't get it to work for me :/ I'm running a liquid smooth nightly with Franco kernal set to permissive. Every time I soft reboot to enable the tweak I just get system ui crashes repeatedly
xposed,2xpco7,cola5000,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:54:13 2015 UTC,Then 2.38 only works with a few devices after all... I'm using it on Nexus 6 stock rom.
xposed,2xpco7,graesen,4,Tue Mar 3 04:27:19 2015 UTC,This will be actually possible with an upcoming tablet made by 2 Ex-Googlers. The tablet should look pretty smililar to an Microsoft Surface and sports Android Lollipop with some nifty features like this added. I look forward to the release.

xposed,2xsbea,Domini384,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:51:17 2015 UTC,i rarely use google play to save data not because of low usage   most of the time i will use either apk downloader or apk-dl.com
xposed,2xsbea,Domini384,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:56:24 2015 UTC,Why would you need a module for this when its just something you can avoid opening?
xposed,2xt1gp,SirNelsonOfWales,2,Tue Mar 3 17:33:59 2015 UTC,XDA thread regarding xposed below. Go back a couple pages and there is a zip to flash in recovery that someone posted that makes our kernel boot SELinux  permissive then flash the xposed in recovery. You can enable modules without having to reboot. Xposed works awesome now on my g3.  http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/official-xposed-lollipop-t3030118/page328

xposed,2xsy2k,GazaIan,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:35:20 2015 UTC,Does that one work any better than v 2.38? I was using it but it's pretty unstable.
xposed,2xsy2k,GazaIan,1 point,Thu Mar 5 02:05:06 2015 UTC,"Its pretty good so far, having some issues running two apps at once, but I couldn't even get 2.38 to run without repeated system ui crashes.

xposed,2xqbq1,KnifeFed,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:08:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't know about this. Switched to this, unfortunately it doesn't have what I'm looking for. It'd be great if the module supported both."
xposed,2xqbq1,nofunallowed98765,1 point,Wed Mar 4 12:54:50 2015 UTC,I think the GPU driver in cf.lumen shouldn't have the red hue in screenshots.

xposed,2xqaju,bleblub,2,Tue Mar 3 00:20:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't done any research or anything but I can maybe give you a little insight.   I have 1 other user on my Nexus 7. It's my 4 year old son, who has a restricted profile. I installed Xposed and Gravitybox, and the tweaks are applied to his profile too.   Xposed doesn't show up on his profile though, because I haven't enabled it through the user settings since he's a restricted profile.   I've just checked and it doesn't appear in the apps on the guest mode either, but the tweaks are still there."

xposed,2xmysu,NalNalas,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yap, meant it that way. Topics about modules that have to be fixed for lollipop, only work for lollipop or generally lollipop related xposed issues."

xposed,2xnm9a,aashukmehta,3,Tue Mar 3 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"They stated that programs such as VLC or mxplayer that use their own popup/standalone player will not be compatible. Besides that, it's working great for me but it's also offering popups for html5 videos which is a little frustrating. I'm using it for Reddit and it's nice on the videos but you can't make it discriminate so I get a notification on the top of my screen every time a gif style html5 video plays and it's just not necessary for that. You can disable it for certain apps but then I won't be able to use it at all on Reddit. Maybe in the future they can add more detailed filters."
xposed,2xnm9a,jld2k6,1 point,Tue Mar 3 05:34:38 2015 UTC,"It's Android system that causes those pop up notifications, so far it's working fine in reddit."
xposed,2xnm9a,Eagle1337,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yea it's the lollipop notification system, which is what makes the module so easy to use. If I were to disable it it would defeat the usefulness of the module :(  Heads-up notifications is the term I believe."
xposed,2xnm9a,jld2k6,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:20:51 2015 UTC,I meant to disable the pop ups with gifvs

I like it for videos in bacon reader, but gifs are usually pointless since they're so short.   I have the golden ticket if it's a premium feature that I'm missing.  Great module though man. One of my favorites and looks great on a nexus 6."
xposed,2xnm9a,Caliguy310,0,Mon May 25 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"2 Concerns:   This app constantly draws over all screens (as near as I can tell). This means you need to uninstall or otherwise disable it before you can install another xposed module. This doesn't work with Netflix. That's understandable, and happened on the iOS equivalent as well, so I'm not gonna harp too much on that little bit.   Edit: But seriously, this is awesome!"
xposed,2xnm9a,ThePenultimateOne,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:53:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Haven't got issues with overdrawing, what are your device specs?"
xposed,2xnm9a,ThePenultimateOne,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:44:29 2015 UTC,"S5, AT&T. Exynos version I think. It stopped after a reinstall, which is even more confusing, but I had to use the Xposed version on reinstall, and the play store version on install. Maybe there was a discrepancy?"
xposed,2xop1z,maxthebrax,3,Mon Mar 2 17:15:24 2015 UTC,Install a kernel that is se linux permissive by default.

xposed,2xop1z,wittyusernametaken,2,Tue Mar 3 00:21:46 2015 UTC,Leankernel for the Nexus 6 wasn't permissive by default. Not sure about the G3.
xposed,2xop1z,TheGreatDave,2,Tue Mar 3 16:33:00 2015 UTC,Flash a ROM where it works flawlessly like Candy5? Probably a last resort thing but still.
xposed,2xop1z,Pinsel-Wascher,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:34:05 2015 UTC,Is Candy5 as stable as cm12? Im loving cm12 because its so incredibly stable.
xposed,2xop1z,Phoexyael15,2,Mon Mar 2 19:06:58 2015 UTC,Have the same issue. A minor annoyance but irritating none the less.
xposed,2xo56h,beltoft,4,Mon Mar 2 14:31:18 2015 UTC,I don't know if that is possible. Xposed works in the software level while what you want is the kernel level. Modules and such.
xposed,2xo56h,Cabagekiller,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:18:36 2015 UTC,Maybe you're right. I was hoping that xposed could intercept the data generated from the usb reader when a card was near it and tell the rest of the system that it comes from the NFC

I'm not sure of the exact steps, but I usually start pressing up on volume / home button as much as I can quickly (5-6 times) as soon as the bootanimation starts, the phone will vibrate a bit, and as you continue, it'll do a long vibrate, xposed will be disabled and you'll have to click ""update"" in the xposed app to reactivate."

xposed,2xoh9s,ForeverJamon,3,Mon Mar 2 16:16:15 2015 UTC,This isn't a phone level thing. Its a deal cut between you service provider and those apps.
xposed,2xoh9s,bilged,2,Mon Mar 2 16:45:09 2015 UTC,But how does the data know where it came from?
xposed,2xoh9s,bilged,2,Mon Mar 2 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"Because its going through your provider's servers. If you wanted to disguise data as WhatsApp for example, both you and the server you're ultimately communicating with would have to work together to do so."
xposed,2xoh9s,2012DOOM,0,Mon Mar 2 17:16:31 2015 UTC,So it's really impossible?
xposed,2xoh9s,simulations,6,Mon Mar 2 17:18:16 2015 UTC,Unless you have access to their servers you cannot do it.

xposed,2xavo3,Georgelogan,2,Fri Feb 27 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"There's an Xposed module actually called ""Screen Filter."" It has a toggle in the status bar with bar to adjust the filter level. Long press on the icon to the left of the bar and it brings you to the settings where you can put on a filter to cool or warm the screen and the intensity level of the filter. Don't know if that's all what you're looking for or the right package, but I think it works great. If not then there's also the app Lux which does all of the same and then some."
xposed,2xavo3,CoolJumper,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just want something basic, seems with that module you would have to be constantly readjusting. There are tons of apps with the same functionality, I'm currently using Easyeyez. But really I just want to be able to set the settings I like and have an easy on/off through the quick toggles. Opening an app is so much work."
xposed,2xavo3,CoolJumper,2,Fri Feb 27 02:46:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, I totally get where you're coming from. It's mainly the temperature filter that's the work there. The rest is easy but I'm also lazy as fuck and never deal with that, just the basic screen filter. I think Lux has just the little ongoing notification were you turn it on or off and can toggle night mode from it. It takes some setup but afterwards I think it'll do it all from the notification. But if not then good luck finding something that works for you!"

You can find many complaints of people being banned for this. The ban is temp so as to show you didn't do anything wrong, they're just concerned for you. If you haven't been banned yet, you'll get it soon."

xposed,2x1gdx,jageun,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:17:47 2015 UTC,I mostly do it for my kids. We have a tablet that they use and it works out nice that I can purchase an app on my phone that they can then use on the tablet. This allows me to remove any billing information off the tablet (think free-mium games).  This also allows me to keep all my personal emails and calendar info off that tablet as well (think prying eyes or lost tablet).  I have a 3rd account set up specifically for all the stupid apps that constantly remind me to connect with Google+. I don't care about sharing high scores with my friends (mostly because I don't have any) and I just wanted to get rid of that stupid reminder.
xposed,2x1gdx,shakeador,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:47:59 2015 UTC,"i see! I haven't thought of that.  maybe setting an account as predetermined instead of removing the other ones would be easier, i think. although i have no experience with developing so maybe not lol"

This means you can reduce battery usage without completely deactivating app processes."

xposed,2ws13v,doublejrecords,8,Sun Feb 22 22:10:35 2015 UTC,Usually it's just recommended to not use it because CM has lots of its features built in. As long as features you use don't conflict GB should work fine.

xposed,2ws13v,Jimbojib,3,Sun Feb 22 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"Did you even read the description on XDA?   ""Some words about GB's main concept. One thing I didn't like about xposed modules was that it was always necessary to reboot a device after making a change to some option. Since GB's main concept was to turn MTK devices running stock ROM into something that's close enough to a feature-packed custom ROM, I had to take a decision - for it to be as much comfortable as possible and to really behave like a custom ROM, I had to design it to support most of the preference changes to be done on the fly without needing to reboot a device. While this sounds nice, it also brings couple of ""drawbacks"". For changes to be made on the fly, it is necessary to make some preparations when device starts. This means, even if you don't use the particular feature, the necessary preparation/modification is already there and is waiting for the user to come and change that option.  This means it is not possible to ""completely deactivate"" particular feature if it causes trouble on your device or if you installed GB because you want to use only one particular feature you can't find elsewhere. This results in issues on ROMs/devices that have parts that are diverting from default Android implementation too much, or are running heavily modified custom ROMs.""  Also: ""DO NOT USE WITH CUSTOM ROMS LIKE CM,AOSPA,ROOTBOX,AOKP,SLIM,CATACLYSM,OMNI AND THEIR OTHER CLONES... IT MAKES NO SENSE AND CAN CAUSE CONFLICTS AND UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR"""

xposed,2ws13v,BilingualBloodFest,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"That's the official disclaimer, but it definitely works perfectly fine. It's only when you try to use it with heavily modified (MIUI) or OEM ROMs that it actually breaks.   That said, it goes without saying that if your ROM comes with the same features as GB, don't enable them on both.."
xposed,2ws13v,OmegaVesko,1 point,Tue Feb 24 12:39:46 2015 UTC,"As I understood it, the way gravity box works is almost every mod is implemented when you install it, the app settings just toggle their visibility. This means even the options you don't use have a chance to cause conflicts with other mods. I'm glad it's worked for you so far, but there might be issues later when features are added/altered."

xposed,2wpxge,blacksheep420,1 point,Sun Feb 22 06:25:14 2015 UTC,Same here. If you do a full reboot you can flash it again and wipe caches and it will boot up again.

xposed,2wocq6,Rogue_3,2,Sat Feb 21 18:20:29 2015 UTC,To install xposed only requires that you be rooted. As it's an app you install and it requires root access to put it into system.  No custom recovery required.
xposed,2wocq6,Aeowon,3,Sat Feb 21 20:13:46 2015 UTC,For lollipop you have to flash in the recovery for now
xposed,2wocq6,Domini384,2,Sat Feb 21 21:30:32 2015 UTC,But you don't have to flash the recovery image...you can simply boot a recovery image (which doesn't write to flash) and you'll be back to stock after a reboot into standard Android.
xposed,2wocq6,_invader_,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"I think you can create a nandroid backup using adb (which you'll have to use to flash your custom recovery). You'll have to Google instructions for it.  However, if you have all your data backed up (texts, pictures, etc), it's not necessary. Once you have a custom recovery, making a full backup is just one swipe from within the recovery tool. Then if you need to recover your OS, a quick restore will put your old OS and data exactly as they were at the time of the backup."
xposed,2wocq6,onlyzul,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:53:33 2015 UTC,I've got the same setup.  I am not using a custom recovery. I'm waiting for Lollipop support to stabilize before I take the OTA.  You will want either Wanam or XSecureStorage
xposed,2wocq6,GoogleIsYourFrenemy,0,Sat Feb 21 20:32:29 2015 UTC,In order to install xposed you have to flash a zip file. This usually only works with custom recoveries.

xposed,2w8yw1,bleblub,17,Wed Feb 18 00:02:44 2015 UTC,It was also the fact that he was republishing their app and code. With xposed it's hooking in to their existing app and doesn't require publishing their code.

xposed,2w8yw1,KuduIO,7,Wed Feb 18 13:45:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. Once it becomes as simple as installing an APK the potential user base expands drastically. And with it comes motivation for Snapchat to do something.

Now if you want to tilt your phone to the right, move it left first, confirm the rotation (screen will be rotated right), turn your phone around and don't confirm the rotation this time, so it will just stay the way it is."

xposed,2w5rhp,subduedLion,34,Tue Feb 17 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"SELinux stands for ""Security Enhanced Linux"", and with good reason. It means that every app in Android runs in it's own sandbox, which means each application is isolated from one another. From Android Lollipop and forward, everything is set to ""enforcing"" which basically means shits locked down for your security. In Kitkat only some of the most crucial parts (called 'domains'), of Android was locked.  If everything is set to permissive all apps can, without hindrance, find and browse everything on your phone, including other apps data. That means userdata, passwords, etc.  So that is why it is generally a bad idea to set everything to permissive, we don't want apps to browse content it's not supposed to.  I hope that was ELI5 enough for you, else just ask away."
xposed,2w5rhp,chrismastere,4,Tue Feb 17 07:29:17 2015 UTC,Apps can't see other apps' data (unless you're talking about the data on the SD card?) unless the developers explicitly make their data world readable.
xposed,2w5rhp,GermainZ,6,Tue Feb 17 10:39:25 2015 UTC,That was a phenomenal answer. Absolutely nailed it. Thank you for being intricate; it really helped.
xposed,2w5rhp,lazycoder9000,3,Tue Feb 17 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"Hey you might want to read my response, check the comments once more.  In short, Android has always used other methods to sandbox apps, SELinux was only recently implemented and it can be seen as an additional layer of security, but even it is not fool proof (a kernel vuln can always beat SELinux, but those are kind of rare)"
xposed,2w5rhp,lazycoder9000,3,Tue Feb 17 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"That's what I extrapolated from the other guys' response. I'd rather have an extra layer of privacy and protection than a few Xposed modules that may or may not need permissive access later on. Thank you for the further clarification and added input, it's greatly appreciated, man!"
xposed,2w5rhp,easybread,4,Tue Feb 17 21:15:22 2015 UTC,"This is quite false. SELinux was implemented only in recent versions of Android, which has always used POSIX permissions to enforce the sandbox (each app is a user and group, and multiple apps signed by the same key will be under the same user and group). Without SELinux, apps still can't willy nilly do whatever they want,l. SELinux is a great addition though because it can secure more privileged processes like one owned by the System that takes a lot of input from potentially malicious apps, because it can be limited to only what it's allowed to do, despite it's state of high permission to do bad things, in case it were ever ""hacked"" by something."

xposed,2w5rhp,Heliumx,2,Tue Feb 17 19:06:40 2015 UTC,Selinux Mode Changer is how you'd change it. TBH I don't know  what the negative effects of changing are other than apps can dig deeper into android. Kind of like removing the barriers to a sandbox. In kitkat  the default mode was permissive if I recall correctly.
xposed,2w5rhp,Doomfield,2,Tue Feb 17 07:18:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer and the link to the application. From the sound of it, changing it isn't worth the privacy intrusiveness."

Previously you would have to find a ROM dev who would have done that for you in his ROM. But you'd have to take everything else that came with it.  With  Xposed you can stick to your TouchWiz and mod your ROM just to display the clock in the middle and nothing else.  Now imagine the possibilities of configuration which is what Android all about. There are some xposed modules that make you a power user, and cannot be replicated with apps."

Some guys are expecting a miraclous fix that will solve all their multitasking issues with ram on the Moro G.  We still dont know how deep that fix will improve things or if it barely make things better.  Yeah, there are memory leaks, but as bad a memory leaks is, it isn't that significative on this device to totally change the experience with a software patch.   If the leakage was that bad, the software wouldn't be released at first. Do you guys think motorola haven't tested their software before releasing it? The memory leak exists but if it passed the testing stages without being noticed, it is because it is not that significative or severe.   Also, if you check other ROMS, even tweaked for performance, they don't make a real/huge difference compared to the stock rom that comes with the MOTO G.   Just don't expect a ""miracle"" to happen because it won't happen. And down vote me the day that the fix gets released and it solves all the ""redraws"" and multitasking issues that the Moto G has.

xposed,2w2afn,Blunt_Wizard,2,Mon Feb 16 23:37:45 2015 UTC,"• What do you mean? It can do a few things here.   • We can make both of your bars change depending on the color next to them so theyre dynamic, you looking at a blue photo? Your bars are now blue.   • We can make both bars chose their color based on the action bar (the bar of color on apps below the stat bar). This is unfortunately inconsistent because not everyone uses the ""real"" action bar and some don't use it.  • So you may want to chose color by hand on a per app basis, with an option for a transparent shade to be put over the stat bar so that its a little darker like what apps normally do now with colored status bar.  • Now the last thing we could do is match the nav bar to the stat bar of a material app, which wouldnt be very useful for 95% of apps that haven't gone through a material redesign, or that have but don't use a colored stat bar.   • If every one is wondering why devs for big name apps are apprehensive to change the color of the nav bar to match the stat bar? Because in googles design guidelines, it says not to change its color, but these are just guidelines, and if you can pull it off in a slick way on your app that's not jarring, you're good, take Pandora's new material redesign for example (they may have just made them both transparent though... Which does comply with the guidelines)  • As far as transitions go, I haven't tried it my self but they only last one second max default so that color has to change within one second, and from a design standpoint that may not look good in practice (but I haven't tried)  Edit: stuff"
xposed,2w2afn,Blunt_Wizard,2,Mon Feb 16 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"I think dynamic color selection is not fast and accurate. It could be used on apps without material status bar color but it seems like waste of power on already materialized apps. Like just get the color of status bar on material apps. And let people use dynamic or per app on rest of the apps.  I don't think design guidelines are really that important when google doesn't care about it. I just think a colored nav bar would look cool.   About transitions, I have no idea but stock lollipop is doing stat bar transitions really smooth and they look good."
xposed,2w2afn,robochicken11,2,Mon Feb 16 17:19:44 2015 UTC,"Alright so we just need to make a module that detects apps with api access above level 21, so this would mean apps for lollipop ONLY meaning MOST (not all) will have colored stat bars, and you'd take that value and apply it to the nav bar, and then for apps with a lower api access we would allow per app theming, possibly again an option to mimic the stat bar just in case,.

xposed,2vz637,Eagle1337,8,Sun Feb 15 18:34:49 2015 UTC,The trouble with a public spreadsheet is... The public is full of morons. Perhaps you should make it invite only or something. What a pain!
xposed,2vz637,taintedviper,2,Sun Feb 15 20:35:06 2015 UTC,I don't think invite only will help. Anyone can ask for an invite and then mess it up.

xposed,2vz637,thejumbles,2,Mon Feb 16 09:38:03 2015 UTC,"Xposed allows Greenify more access to the system such as utilizing Google Cloud Messenger and Greenifying system apps.

xposed,2vz637,TopHatTogepi,2,Mon Feb 16 08:03:15 2015 UTC,"Given the API hasn't changed not all modules will need updating.  From the XDA short interview   Do we need to rewrite all the modules?  No, the Xposed API is pretty much unchanged. Xposed abstracts all the details, so modules don’t need to care whether they’re running on Dalvik or ART. Many modules will actually work without any changes, especially those which modify the behavior of user apps. Modules targeting the system behavior might need to be adjusted to the new Android framework code, which isn’t caused by ART, but simply by architecture and code changes that happen between any two Android releases. The most significant one is that the code for system services has been moved to a separate file. For most of the affected modules, this can be solved by a little refactoring (moving code to a different place)."

I'm not very familiar with it, so I can't offer a lot of advice. Did you try reflashing the framework and reinstalling the APK? Also, make sure SuperSU is granting Xposed root access.   If it's any consolation, there are so few working modules so early that it's not a huge loss if it doesn't work flawlessly.

xposed,2w0tod,a_p3rson,5,Mon Feb 16 00:07:58 2015 UTC,Considering that the Dev of Gravity Box made separate branches for KitKat and jellybean. Its doubtful that KitKat will be forgotten as Lollipop development pushes forward.  Right now we are at the edge of something wonderful with the release of Xposed for Lollipop. That said I doubt we will see the end of KitKat development for quite some time now.
xposed,2w0tod,Rassilon_Lord_of_Tim,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"GravityBox is one of the mods I use, so I'm glad to hear that it's unlikely they'll abandon KK.  Considering the differences in coding for KK versus LP, though (don't know the ins-and-outs, not a developer), would developing a mod for LP make it not work on KK? Is there a way for a mod to be compatible for both, or would that be overly complicated?"
xposed,2w0tod,Rassilon_Lord_of_Tim,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:15:40 2015 UTC,From my understanding it may be easier to port something to KK than it would be for LP. LP requires more tweaking to get a module to work while KK requires a method that is more commonplace for those familiar with developing modules. At the end of the day it really is more about demand of users.   Another thing to note is that right now KK/JB is the largest base of users currently. LP is still new as official OEM updates are starting to come out. We have custom ROM's but the beauty of Xposed is getting custom ROM features for stock ROM's.   KK isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I would say it has at least a good year left of support. When the majority numbers for LP outweigh KK then it would be time to assume support cutoff. That isn't going to happen for quite some time.
xposed,2w0tod,BrassRhino,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:28:01 2015 UTC,If you read the FAQ on XDA he states that the latest version works on version 4.x as well. For the most part mods well be backwards compatible as the API is mostly unchanged. If the mod changes system resources there may be a different version for K vs L but the difference will be small.
xposed,2w0tod,Rassilon_Lord_of_Tim,0,Mon Feb 16 00:45:45 2015 UTC,In addition. The only thing that can be certain is that we will likely NOT see Xposed support KK running ART. Since ART is different from KK to LP it is safe to assume that Xposed for KK will remain using the Dalvik Runtime to not split hairs in development between KK/LP development.

xposed,2vxwnc,Kautiontape,1 point,Sun Feb 15 14:49:38 2015 UTC,I've heard greenify won't work and they have to remake gravity box. Yeah

xposed,2vxwnc,freshairr,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:16:56 2015 UTC,Did you try installing modules already!
xposed,2vxwnc,sirleechalot,1 point,Sun Feb 15 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"Several times, even after a few attempts of uninstalling / reinstalling Xposed. I basically ran through all the common suggestions people had and it didn't work. I figure either I somehow screwed something really trivial up, I'm a weird edge-case that will be fixed in a future bug, or I need to reflash my firmware."
xposed,2vxwnc,freshairr,2,Sun Feb 15 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"The weird thing for me is that it did work the first time I did it but then after a few reboots it stopped.   Don't know what to do, so I'm just waiting now for further updates."
xposed,2vxwnc,sirleechalot,1 point,Sun Feb 15 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Same thing happened to me. Worked the first time, but after a reboot it isn't. I tried re installing but that doesn't work"
xposed,2vxwnc,06jeepguy,1 point,Sun Feb 15 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"So apparently if you soft reboot from inside the Xposed app, the modules start working again. But for me, it does something wonky with my adaptive brightness (doesn't adjust to different lighting conditions).   So anytime you reboot from the power menu, xposed doesn't work. You'll have to reboot, then soft reboot from the app."

xposed,2vxwnc,akshay7394,1 point,Mon Feb 16 01:15:34 2015 UTC,Depending on what kind of phone you are using using an SELinux permissive kernel will solve the issue of only being able to soft reboot.
xposed,2vxwnc,PlusJack,2,Mon Feb 16 07:55:04 2015 UTC,"This is how it's supposed to be. What do you think is wrong here? It shows your current version number in green and gives you options to reboot. You can't install using the app anymore, but it even says that you can't."
xposed,2vxwnc,akshay7394,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:37:20 2015 UTC,"I think his question is because it still doesn't indicate itself as being active, either."
xposed,2vxwnc,Eagle1337,1 point,Sun Feb 15 09:35:29 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the green indicates it's active. If you aren't sure you can still check the logs from within the app.
xposed,2vxwnc,Goliath27,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:44:38 2015 UTC,"Not green on XposedBridge. If the same number appeared in green under app_process then it's active. (Pre-lollipop, that is. Now the UI just doesn't work correctly for the time being.)"

The dev himself was on a Nexus 5.  The Rovo did mention that Samsung devices wouldn't work quite yet, but I think that was specifically about Touchwiz, so CM 12 might not be included in that blanket statement."

xposed,2vv4iv,severide_,3,Sun Jun 28 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Snapchat 9.0.2.0 definitely works, it's anything higher than that, that I caution using and experienced reports with (9.1.0.0, 9.1.2.0).  Snapprefs has been around for a few months and pretty sure only recently did it add the same features as Keepchat/Snapshare. I completely forgot about it or I would have mentioned.

xposed,2vv4iv,severide_,1 point,Sat Feb 14 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Yup. Snapchat somehow added a way to find it.

xposed,2vv4iv,severide_,2,Sat Feb 14 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"I hope the same too, since the dev had the XDA thread closed/deleted, hard to warn people and get the word out.  For the 3rd party warning, if it hadn't happened to me on a new account, and only ever logging into the official Snapchat app and only using Keepchat and Snapshare, I probably wouldn't have been too worried but since that was the scenario..  If you sent it to yourself, then yes it should indicate you took a screenshot when you open it."

xposed,2vevzx,m0c4z1n,6,Thu Feb 12 01:57:39 2015 UTC,I'm surprised this hasn't got the attention it deserves.   I'm still stuck with KitKat! I've been waiting for this news!
xposed,2vevzx,brendanvista,5,Tue Feb 10 17:53:17 2015 UTC,Thank you based xposed

xposed,2vevzx,Leraeniesh,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:33:21 2015 UTC,Hope old modules still work.
xposed,2vevzx,ThinkBritish,2,Fri Feb 13 16:07:03 2015 UTC,Yes. He said the API still works pretty much the same way.. I'm gonna wait and let him kill some bugs before I update personally. Look at the newest post about it.

xposed,2vb23b,lecander,6,Mon Feb 9 15:31:53 2015 UTC,There's no guarantee that xposed will ever work again. Eventually you just gotta move on
xposed,2vb23b,PeshMG,4,Mon Feb 9 16:39:58 2015 UTC,Not yet. Unfortunately :(
xposed,2vb23b,SeeMeCare,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:36:30 2015 UTC,Then I wait.

xposed,2vb23b,Syborg49,1 point,Mon Feb 9 17:11:06 2015 UTC,Might be a long wait....
xposed,2vb23b,_Mayhem_,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:50:32 2015 UTC,This is exactly why my Galaxy S5 won't be upgraded to Lollipop. No Xposed? I stay on Kitkat.
