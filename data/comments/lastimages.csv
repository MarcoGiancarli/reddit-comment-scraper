I was having a terrible time because my dream was to move away to New York City but at the time I felt it could never happen. Plus I got into a huge fight with my friend and was the weirdest kid at my school, so a fight with that one friend was pretty devastating. Anyway, we all went into a tourist shop, one of the ones that has all the I Love NY t-shirts and mugs and crap, and the shop keep was SO NICE to me. I think he noticed I was by myself in the crowd and made sure to chit chat with me. Also maybe he noticed I was cool because in reality I WAS the coolest kid in band. I asked him what he was listening to and it was Nick Cave, then I bought a stupid picture of the skyline and remembered that dude for the rest of my life. So thanks dude for playing Nick Cave in your crappy tourist shop and for being super nice to the weird kid."

lastimages,3clrxa,FalloutLoneWanderer,61,Tue Jul 14 15:22:41 2015 UTC,"Jeez. I know many people describe suicide as a selfish act but most goodbye posts or suicide notes i've read are so focused on how big a favor the person thinks they're doing for everyone else and I know research points to that ""feeling like a burden"" being one of the biggest predictors of whether someone will complete the act eventually. I am so sorry for your loss."
lastimages,3clrxa,newfaceinhell,3,Wed Jul 8 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"you're right, it's tone is different to 'most'."
lastimages,3clrxa,domaa,-26,Thu Jul 9 10:48:06 2015 UTC,"The act is considered selfish because they don't think about all the people that their passing affects. The burden of their death is far harder on their loved ones than what they think they've caused in life. That doesn't necessarily mean they're selfish individuals, but the act is undeniably selfish."
lastimages,3clrxa,Zephs,34,Wed Jul 8 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"The act is considered selfish because they don't think about all the people that their passing affects.   Considering most suicide notes do seem to have an apology for the pain the suicide will cause, this is just outright false. Clearly they do take that into account.   The burden of their death is far harder on their loved ones than what they think they've caused in life.   Yeah, I don't think most suicides are meant to ease the burden they're causing on others. It's that they hate their own life. Feeling like they are a burden is a contributing factor to them not liking their life, but it's not necessarily the only reason they're killing themselves. Why should they have to live their life unhappily for what they feel is forever so that a handful of people aren't sad for a relatively small part of their lives?   That doesn't necessarily mean they're selfish individuals, but the act is undeniably selfish.   And I could say it's equally as selfish to expect another person to continue a life of unhappiness so that others don't need to be unhappy for a little while. If a person truly finds living to be worse than not living, I'd say it's pretty selfish to obligate them to stick around because you like it just fine."
lastimages,3clrxa,FalloutLoneWanderer,15,Thu Jul 9 00:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah working in mental health, most of the reasoning I hear after attempts is that when I (the client) die, I will be grieved for and then forgotten over time whereas if I continue my life the way it is now,  I will continue to hurt and frustrate other people around me because my existence is so pointless and hopeless and every time people try to help me I just end up draining their energy and I never get better. I don't think I can recall anyone who was in a dark enough place to make a serious attempt who realized the long lasting and life changing effect their suicide would have on those close to them. Even with loving parents who have children, it's been ""he'll be better off with my sister in the long run"" or some other caretaker rather than ""this will break him but I'm at the point where I don't care."" With loving husbands and wives in which someone makes a serious attempt it's ""they'll move on and find someone else"". And the ""I don't care what happens to them"" factor is so not-a-thing that I've seen that you can usually steer someone with no other supports to safety in an intervention for no other reason than they are not sure that their cat or dog will find a good home after they die. So, no, I don't think viewing suicide as a selfish act is helpful at all from a mental health care perspective."

lastimages,3aar1e,DranerFox,3,Thu Jun 18 22:54:03 2015 UTC,"Probably for a couple of reasons.  First, when a patient is in a life threatening condition, you don't want to infect them with any germs that you maybe carrying.  I don't know this, but I'd guess the OP may also be  wearing a surgical mask.  A second reason could be that heroin is usually used intravenously and, as is the case with intravenous drug use generally, there is a risk the drug user may have an illness such as hepatitis, which could be transmitted to a person touching them near an intravenous feed, as in the photo. No clue if any of this is applicable to this situation, but it is a reasonable precaution to wear gloves in such circumstances. And, in case it's not clear, I mean no disrespect to the OP or friend in the photo in offering my conjectures.  Really sad to lose someone you care about."

lastimages,3aar1e,nikizzard,2,Fri Jul 10 03:46:17 2015 UTC,I am petrified of EMT using narcan during or after one of my seizures.  I am pretty sure they wouldn't but it still freaks me out.
lastimages,3aar1e,worthlessfucksunited,3,Fri Jun 19 06:33:00 2015 UTC,"That's not likely, but even if they did it wouldn't do anything. FYI the movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is not a realistic portrayal of how to treat an OD. Narcan is administered through the nose or through an IV, and only stops the actions of opioids. No one is going to stab you in the heart with a needle ;)"
lastimages,3aar1e,nikizzard,2,Fri Jun 19 15:49:13 2015 UTC,Ha! Well thanks for the clarification :P
lastimages,3aar1e,Canis_lupus,2,Fri Jun 19 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"What used to amaze me is how cheap Narcan was - something like 50 cents USD a dose.   Unfortunately, this has radically changed recently and that alone may have something to do with why OP's friend didn't get a dose until too late. Some places are buying a lot less and it appears some places aren't buying it at all.  I personally think the stuff should be passed out on street corners on every major city and rural clinic. It's miraculous stuff."

When my dad died (of cancer) we did not take photos.  But this past March 29 an old friends mom went into sudden heart failure. Within hours organs were shutting down.   She had called me to come be with her because she was an only child and all alone.   After they ""pulled the plug"" so to speak,  they left us alone with her mom.  She asked me if it would be weird to have me take pics of them. I said I'd do anything she wanted and needed. So I took some pictures of her kissing her moms cheek and hands. Her mom literally died in those few moments.   But it wasn't weird or creepy and she's actually glad because she has a ""picture of her mom's soul leaving"" (her words)."

I mean, people planning on starting a diet on Monday may binge eat all their favorite foods the weekend before. Heroin users may go overboard in anticipation of quitting forever."

In fact I went to the hospital with him and stayed with him the whole day, and I told him: ""A steak pun is a rare medium, well done."" He about died. He also liked to give me wet willies, and we'd do the whole ""Guess what?"" ""Chicken butt!!"" thing.

The Tsar and his family were executed by Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky under the orders of the Ural Soviet. Some historians attribute the order to the government in Moscow, specifically Vladimir Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov, who wished to prevent the rescue of the Imperial Family by approaching White forces during the ongoing Russian Civil War.   This is supported by a passage in Leon Trotsky's diary.  However, a recent investigation led by V. N. Solovyov concluded that there is no document that indicates that either Lenin or Sverdlov were responsible.
