If you listened to Ghostface Killah or Wu-Tang Clan's music or knew ANYTHING about them AT ALL you would know this isn't Ghostface trying to ""stay relevant"" or ""acting"" in any way. He's about this life. The FBI had whole files on the Wu-Tang Clan in the 90's. The man had to perform wearing a mask in his 20's because he was on the run. Yes, it's immature and dumb but it's the way it is. They're from a different time and a culture. How old are some of you fucking people?"

hiphopheads,3e2ybq,ExtraLucky13,10,Tue Jul 21 16:32:27 2015 UTC,Yea I think this is whats happening. I can't imagine Bronson and Ghost have not crossed paths these past few years. AB has Raekwon on one of his albums and they both roll in the same underground scene.

Old rappers always seem to do something that shows their age and how outta touch they are w things. Action does really respect him, ghost should know this, but like i said, old nigga syndrome.  I fux w Wu and ghost heavvy, but this maan. stop playin ya selves old niggas, stop.  make a diss record, keep it funky, keep it movin. this is dead energy straight up  ohh, another old head thing to do was for that host to bring up the ghost comparison, as if you wouldnt realize actions heard it hundreds of times. corny shit my nigga"

hiphopheads,3e2ybq,tobinsl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"Action's words were, ""He's not rapping like this no more"". To me, that sounds like he's comparing what he is making now to what Ghostface was making back then, like Supreme Clientele."

hiphopheads,3e2ybq,Omnivirus,7,Tue Jul 21 17:05:50 2015 UTC,"""Endless bullshit comparisons"" I'm going to stop you right there it's not bullshit. Whether intentionally or not Action's voice is similar. And it's a common fact that Action is also a big Ghostface fan. So you're telling me that when this guy decided to start rapping he didn't notice his voice was similar? Sometimes in some songs he even takes it a step further and even adds some of the emphasis/pause of Ghostface. He clearly was influenced by him in his flow (completely jacked from Ghostface) now the art he brings to the table may be different but to me at least part of his style is stolen from Ghost. Years ago when I even first heard blue chips for the first time the only thing that popped into my mind is Ghostface."
hiphopheads,3e2ybq,Tangelooo,4,Tue Jul 21 16:20:00 2015 UTC,"""biting"" styles is such a fickle subject with hip-hop fans. I'm completely aware Bronson's voice is similar and he has taken some elements of Ghost style to do his own thing with, but they are far different artists. If this is such a nagging issue then there should be far more uproar over many more artists. Thug seems to be escaping any real damaging criticism of ""biting"" Wayne (a legend in his own right), and creating something entirely new with elements of Wayne's stuff. For fucks sake, Migos bite the hell out of various shit back in the 90's, same with Joey Badass. It's undeniable. There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking something that already exists and doing something new with it. It's been happening for decades.  on top of all of this, even though Bronson's major debut wasn't great, he's still had a better decade than Ghost has. He's still right."
hiphopheads,3e2ybq,tobinsl,4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"People do criticize Thug of biting Wayne, but Wayne's had so many styles and it's not as close of a comparison as Bronson to Ghost.   Before they were beefing, when Ghost would give Bronson props, he actually said he heard a track by him and thought it was himself. This isn't just a similarity or influence. He sounds a lot like him."
hiphopheads,3e2ybq,MissedHerPink,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:13 2015 UTC,Better decade than ghost has? Are you out of your mind? His debut album was a flop and Ghost has still been putting out quality material this entire time. Nothing I would call whack that would justify him falling off. And it's not even like thug or Joey. Joey got criticism for using older beats and not doing his own thing but he proved the naysayers wrong on his other projects. Bronson became a poor man's Ghostface and used that for his mix tapes to gain relevance. Once he tried his own thing on his debut he fell on his face. Dude is a hack. Sour Soul is a great album through and through. Every song remains consistent and it has its bright spots as well.

hiphopheads,3e2jpn,dan0314,0,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"More recently, lean.  Not so recently, Sprite used to have rappers in their commercials performing exclusive/remixed songs promoting their product. St. Ides is most notable for this kind of advertising, but Sprite was doing it first as far as I know.  Old Sprite commercials:  Kurtis Blow (1986)  Heavy D (1990)  Kid & Play (1991)  A Tribe Called Quest (1994)  MC Shan & KRS-One (1995)  Pete Rock, CL Smooth & Grand Puba (1995)  Nas & AZ (1997)  Edit: More commercials...  Pete Rock & CL Smooth (1994)  Lost Boyz (1997)  Missy Elliott w/Kobe Bryant & Tim Duncan (1998)  Goodie Mob, Fat Joe, Common, Mack 10 & Afrika Bambaataa (Full Voltron Campaign, 1998)  Eve, Angie Martinez, Mia X, Amil, Roxanne Shante & Kool Keith (Full 5 Deadly Venoms Campaign, 1999)"
hiphopheads,3e2jpn,GaryTheJerk,0,Tue Jul 21 16:45:40 2015 UTC,Sprite heavily endorses rappers so they rap about mixin their codeine in Sprite instead of something like 7-Up or Citrus Drop
hiphopheads,3e2jpn,MT3,6,Tue Jul 21 16:14:03 2015 UTC,Sprite heavily endorses rappers so they rap about mixin their codeine in Sprite   Where are you getting this from?   I think Drake has mentioned lean a couple times but I believe he's the exception when it comes to rappers that Sprite has endorsed since lean hit the mainstream.
hiphopheads,3e2jpn,GaryTheJerk,0,Tue Jul 21 16:57:24 2015 UTC,I think thats just a joke

hiphopheads,3e2qvs,Linisopolis,6,Tue Jul 21 18:19:03 2015 UTC,Honestly a top 10 album for me (2015). I really enjoyed the album. I thought future really took the listener for a ride and allowed people into the world of drugs he's living. Something I feel a lot of trap rappers seem to miss. I don't feel future has endorsed ds but made it clear how fucked he is because of it   edit: that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. I'm not saying it's aoty but definitely a great album

hiphopheads,3e2qvs,the_zeke,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:35 2015 UTC,Cus it's not? When Asap Mob raps about Pimp C in reference to lean is that okay?

Don't get me wrong, I really liked 56 Nights (and some other Future material), but some of his creative decisions just don't gel with my expectations sometimes.  Of course, that's more on me than on him, but still."

hiphopheads,3e2qvs,hipower805,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"Fantano is trippin for this one. Future perfected his style on this album, it deserves at least an 8. I feel like he has a bias against this style of music and that muddies his opinion a bit.   Edit: Yeah, Anthony's lost it. Rotation is one of the hardest songs. He complains about the songwriting of a guy who is renowned for his song writing (he wrote one of Beyonce's biggest, most recent hits). Also, Future used some of his best flows on this album (like that Magic flow that he used on Where Ya At).   Honestly Future didn't make this album for people like Fantano to like though. The people that actually fuck with Future and this type of music know how good this album is.   I give this review a 4/10"

hiphopheads,3dyljd,basedgod94,114,Mon Jul 20 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"Let's be real though: you don't get this kind of reaction for saying something relatively mild like Bronson did unless the person hearing it catches some truth in the words and it scares the shit out of them.  Bronson called the dude a legend and established respect for what he's done. He just doesn't think his new stuff is up to par. Ghost throwing out a bunch of smack about his old material doesn't change that shit. I mean, I love me some Ghost. Growing up, Ghost was my favorite in Wu Tang. But the dude hasn't had bars like the old days in a while, even if I can dig his new shit. He's one of the members of Wu-Tang that's losing their ability to hang, and I gotta say, I enjoyed Mr. Wonderful a hell of a lot more than Sour Soul.  Maybe it's just the comparison to other Wu-Tang releases in recent memory that drag Ghost's recent stuff down. Pop in Raekwon's Fly International Luxurious Art and it's like he never left. Maybe the best rap album I've heard all year so far. Compared to that, saying Ghost doesn't rap like he used to seems pretty damn true.  Beyond that, is anyone really surprised that Bronson thinks he's better than Ghost? Of course he does. Every rapper gunning for the top has to believe in their soul, mind, and body that they're the best in the world and the greatest of all time. Lose that, and you lose a whole lot of fire. Right or wrong in your opinion, dude did what he had to do for his art and his brand.  I think Ghost probably still thinks he's the GOAT too, and that's cool. But if he thought there wasn't some truth to what Bronson was spitting, he wouldn't make a six minute video calling him out and spread it all around online himself. Ghost, man, you're one of the best there ever will be. But fronting this hard really just shows how deep in your head the young boys like Bronson coming up at you from behind to take you your spot are. Mad respect, but this is the kind of war you can't win. You smash him and it doesn't mean shit, he's just some up and comer and you're Ghostface motherfucking Killah, of course you made it happen. He smashes you, and kid just took out a legend. He's really got nothing to lose."
hiphopheads,3dyljd,BreadandSalt,20,Mon Jul 20 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, but I think this is really more of an instance of Ghost just being one of those dudes that takes no shit. Least of all from Bronson. Ghost just seems like one of those dudes that would pull up a youngin by the collar who looked at him sideways.   Either way, I like both dudes, so I would be totally fine with some stuff on wax if it goes that far. Don't want anything more than that."

hiphopheads,3e1pn6,Curry10,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:11 2015 UTC,"The fact that it's staged only adds to it, I feel. Kane was a great rapper but he also had a performer's instinct."
hiphopheads,3e1pn6,PrinceSitri,25,Tue Jul 21 16:51:01 2015 UTC,Amazed that the DJ kept up
hiphopheads,3e1pn6,mokapharr,4,Tue Jul 21 09:49:23 2015 UTC,"it was staged, why would the music just stop if he dropped a microphone"
hiphopheads,3e1pn6,Bvitamins1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:08 2015 UTC,"I think thats why he blew in the mic. Signal to be ready. Plus hood rhymes with good. Definitely staged but i dont care, its awesome"
hiphopheads,3e2z79,payjayproductions,6,Tue Jul 21 15:44:19 2015 UTC,"I'd say that most of the Wu has... GFK has always been on a steady plateau of excellence. Nothing beats his contributions in mid to late 90's: Cuban Linx, Ironman, Supreme Clientele... others really dug his later projects, but I couldn't get into them. But yes, he is a prominent figure in hip hop, the only thing I would like to see is a wider audience accept his experimental and abstract form of poetry... no other artist has made it as big as him using such random words...  Off topic, regarding Wu-Tang:  Raekwon seems to fluctuate, but always will thrive on the strength of The Purple Tape. Lately, he's been putting in WORK!  Method Man was always relevant because he stayed in the limelight with some movies and his weed smoking... in my opinion his newer stuff has lost him some momentum... plus he said he gave up on his weed habit.  RZA is along the same lines as GFK and Meth... he is the most influential artist to me... his early work is legendary... his l;ater work is so-so, but never drops the torch for creativity and keeping science and spirituality the foundation of his style.  ODB would have been one of the greatest... he is in my world.  GZA is one of the most respected lyricists in hip hop... that's all there is to say... he will remain on that plateau until he tops the first Liquid Swords.  The rest of the guys are just Wu-Tang... and are respectable for that. Their talents are Wu, and will always be acclaimed for that.  Thanks for letting me rant."
hiphopheads,3e2z79,overused_ellipsis,5,Tue Jul 21 16:28:23 2015 UTC,Inspectah Deck has never dropped a bad verse and is still dropping great projects.
hiphopheads,3e2z79,Lucathric,2,Tue Jul 21 16:37:30 2015 UTC,That's true... I like the entire Clan. Wu was my religion for half of my life.  Unfortunately most of his work rarely sees the light of day ... as of now I would rate the members in popularity as follows:  Method Man  Ghostface  RZA  Raekwon  Ol' Dirty  GZA  Inspecktah Deck  Cappadonna  U-God  Masta Killa
hiphopheads,3e2z79,overused_ellipsis,10,Tue Jul 21 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"You're definitely underselling ODB's popularity, especially posthumously I'd argue he's the most famous and certainly most recognizable."
hiphopheads,3e2z79,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,15,Tue Jul 21 18:57:58 2015 UTC,No way Method Man is the most popular Wu-Tang member. Try again.
hiphopheads,3e2y3a,ExtolFan,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"I accept this review far more than Fantano's.  All in all, I agree this album is definitely in the right direction for Wayne. It looks like I enjoyed the album more than these YouTube talking heads, which is more than fine with me..."
hiphopheads,3e2y3a,Iotatl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this album at all. Nothing memorable. This is a bunch of throwaway tracks.  I wished that they talked about his voice though. This is my biggest problem with Wayne currently.  I said it before in another thread on Wayne but his voice is fucking annoying.  I don't know anything about music production but I know what sounds good to my ears.  His voice doesn't sound good to my ears.  It's like it's been autotuned to add melody that doesn't match with the track at all. Autotunchi smdh  It's been 6 years since I liked a Lil Wayne project, but I've loved some of his recent feature verses though."

Rob is one of the most universally hated guys on hhh twitter and now he's literally getting major props from one of the most mysterious rappers in the game."

He knows Rob is a ""ay bruh who copped the new Death Grips CD"" looking face ass so him getting an exclusive track would literally eat away at the souls of each HHH Twitter user. That's all."

(unless all those 6 tracks are going to be magnificent)"
hiphopheads,3dzd38,YouNeedYeezy,7,Mon Jul 20 19:54:58 2015 UTC,Quality over quantity IMO. It sucks we have already heard some of it but they are all great so far and I LOVED most of the waters but it had a filler track here and there.

hiphopheads,3dzd38,HunterReddeh,28,Mon Jul 20 19:47:05 2015 UTC,Has he said that all his projects will be about water? So far its only 2 which I don't think is overdoing it at all.
hiphopheads,3dzd38,MrFirmHandshake,28,Mon Jul 20 21:21:20 2015 UTC,It took the Underachievers 2 projects for everyone to start rolling their eyes about their 'enlightenment' shtick. But then again Micks lyrics are a bit more thought provoking than the UA so it could be a different story
hiphopheads,3dzd38,WackUserName,21,Mon Jul 20 21:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well from the 3 tracks he's released for this tape none of them have had the same feel from The Waters or even really talked about water. He says ""Drink More Water"" in Alchemy but that's it."
hiphopheads,3dzd38,damnBcanilive,6,Mon Jul 20 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"Lets be real tho, the tape is called Wave[s] which insinuates water so i think its fair to assume that water is going to be a focal point of this project  Edit..plus not all Water[s] songs were about water either"
hiphopheads,3dzd38,WackUserName,11,Mon Jul 20 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah but my point is that on The Waters, outside of a handful of tracks, every song spoke about or was explicitly about water in one way or another. Doesn't seem to be the case with this project."
hiphopheads,3dzd38,damnBcanilive,3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"Mick isnt gonna give away the concept of the mixtape with singles tho. We will just have to see, we know nothing about it outside of the 3 tracks we've heard"
hiphopheads,3dzd38,WackUserName,6,Mon Jul 20 22:56:37 2015 UTC,He's said explicitly that waves won't follow the same theme as his previous work. He said it was too draining too make such dark music so waves is going to be just a feel good album.
hiphopheads,3dzd38,ShiftyLegs,2,Mon Jul 20 23:08:03 2015 UTC,He dropped a line about water in Ps and Qs and he drinks water at the end of the video.

It just seems silly that your making an excuse for a low quality song for the sake of artwork. Like your buddy is in the car listening with you and he says 'damn this quality is really bad' and you respond with 'well its fine cause it matches the artwork'  That just sounds corny af"

Rihanna - Bitch Better Have My Money (Gent & Jawns Remix)  Rihanna - Bitch Better Have My Money (GTA Remix)  Waka Flocka - No Hands (CRNKN Remix)  Waka Flocka - Rooster In My Rari (TNGHT Remix)  Chief Keef - Love Sosa (RL Grime Remix)  or the somewhat similar Major Lazer - Jah No Partial (Yellowclaw & Yung Felix Remix)  And since I personally think it makes a perfect mashup:  Branchez x Rae Sremmurd - Heroes Got No Type (Tentatively named) made by /u/Lafret because I couldn't get the mashup out of my head ever since I listened to the Branchez remix to Alesso - Heroes (ft. Tove Lo)

Omen is best-known for melodic yet aggressive power metal/fantasy metal along the lines of King Diamond, Queensrÿche, Savatage, Manowar, and Helloween; Omen is forceful and hard-driving, but they're always been musical and melodic."

hiphopheads,3e1be7,Old_Man_Orgy,10,Tue Jul 21 04:53:21 2015 UTC,Vince said in an interview SZA was supposed to be singing on this which I would definitely prefer
hiphopheads,3e1be7,MyNamesE,2,Tue Jul 21 11:57:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I can't really listen to this song as it is.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,redadidasjumpsuit,9,Tue Jul 21 15:24:30 2015 UTC,Really enjoyed this song. Summertime is along with 3230 are my favorites on his album.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,papatonton,6,Tue Jul 21 06:23:58 2015 UTC,Videos not available. Either way this was my favourite song of the album. I find as I've gotten older my tastes in Hip hop as evolved somewhat. I really dig these sort of ethereal feels to songs these days. This song is very good example of that type of I really love.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,Slotherz,13,Tue Jul 21 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"Is it me or is this album not receiving the recognition it deserves? It's on 87 on Meta critic damn, which is lower than GKMC, but higher than Section80  EDIT: I get confused easily"
hiphopheads,3e1be7,OllieTDP,9,Tue Jul 21 07:21:21 2015 UTC,No GKMC is at 91.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,MadIcarus,6,Tue Jul 21 07:26:51 2015 UTC,Ah shit I was thinking of Section80
hiphopheads,3e1be7,OllieTDP,11,Tue Jul 21 07:33:41 2015 UTC,I think it's purely because Vince isn't all that common in the public.    But yeah this album is easily of my favourites so far this year. Production is solid but it's a real shame that he's not that big.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,LooseHead,5,Tue Jul 21 09:15:37 2015 UTC,It's good that other artists are giving him the props he deserves though
hiphopheads,3e1be7,OllieTDP,5,Tue Jul 21 12:14:13 2015 UTC,Easily my favorite album this year so far. Production is amazing and he flows so well with the rhythm of the songs.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,SWAGGY_BURNING_PEE,4,Tue Jul 21 14:10:16 2015 UTC,There is something really cool about the juxtaposition of Senorita then this in album order. This song was definitely one of my favorites.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,MrWarMachine,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:29 2015 UTC,someone needs to make an instrumental to this shit.   So smooth.
hiphopheads,3e1be7,MarvinColle,4,Tue Jul 21 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"I really don't like this song - I'm not one of those guys who hates auto tone or vocoders by default or anything, but I really can't stand this one."
hiphopheads,3e1be7,pileofpidgins,6,Tue Jul 21 14:12:16 2015 UTC,I am one of those guys who dislikes auto tune and I love this song. Vince's voice just sounds real depressed and the two guitar strings that loop sound incredible

I prefer Rocky's LSD as far as all these singy hip hop songs go. He's the only one whose really been able to nail it. The guitar loop is uninspired and boring. The rest of this album is great though."
hiphopheads,3e1be7,redadidasjumpsuit,3,Tue Jul 21 15:26:43 2015 UTC,Im usually not a van of Vince doing hooks but I love the way his melancholy voice mixes with the guitar on this one

hiphopheads,3dyusq,romanreignsWWECHAMP,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"Even tho I'm a youngster who has grown up without Wu Tang and Ghostface in my listening library for the most part, the only similarity I really see between them is the sort of ""edge"" on their voice. Their flows are close, but exaggerated when people say you literally can't tell them apart.  Great respect to both artists, Ghostface as a legend and Bronsolino as an up-and-comer, but Bronson was tired of getting compared, and I wouldn't blame him. He literally said earlier in that same interview ""I'm just glad people compare me to one of the greats.""  Historically, hip hop has always been about fronting and saying shit like ""oh I'm better than you,"" and you could tell through the interview that Bronson gets that question a lot and was tired of it. Plus, the interviewer asked the question in a hella loaded way.  Overall, stupid beef."
hiphopheads,3dyusq,aagejaeger,20,Mon Jul 20 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I honestly doubt Ghostface is genuine about the threats. The dude had flak thrown at him, and would be allowing an up-and-comer walk all over him if he didn't respond in this manner. Shit will breeze over and they will eventually smoke a J and make a track together. So Action can give him a few pointers."
hiphopheads,3dyusq,doc7114,56,Mon Jul 20 22:21:58 2015 UTC,he wasn't even serious he was just hazing Bronson to scare him because ghostface is self aware and knows Bronson would never actually go through with a beef he's just teaching him a lesson   https://youtu.be/z93IaKPY_Wc?t=3m39s  think of Fresh prince of bel air imagine Carelton said something dumb and instantly regretted it literally calling Will up and apologizing right after   he'd fuck with him for a bit but why would you take it serious lmao  God gave them the same tone  so just relax

hiphopheads,3dzvx4,Laz_The_Kid,18,Tue Jul 21 01:20:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's definitely true. But he's been given a platform by his celebrity status to address these kinda of issues. Yeah he's obviously just a kid, but he also has people heeding his every word so it would probably behoove him to think carefully about the messages he's sending."
hiphopheads,3dzvx4,yeahahhah,9,Mon Jul 20 23:37:33 2015 UTC,What message is he sending that is potentially negative? He made the statement that Bill is being used to further an existing negative narrative about black people and postulated as to why.

hiphopheads,3dzvx4,romanreignsWWECHAMP,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"He needs to go further and make his point absolutely clear. People are taking it like he's hateful towards transwomen or defending a rapist  when he's really saying don't believe everything the media tells you point blank. That's nothing new, he just sort of wrapped it up in a controversial way.  Also how people don't get why he's suspicious of the media when murderers walk free and the news is okay with it is beyond me"

I read all his stuff and I thought he was interesting. I agree with a lot of the points he made. I absolutely don’t agree with the way he got his point across.

hiphopheads,3dze8f,Chrussell,4,Tue Jul 21 01:20:14 2015 UTC,Nah I know I just thought you didn't know what he meant
hiphopheads,3dze8f,skillmau5,8,Tue Jul 21 01:50:43 2015 UTC,Already has way more hits and trap queen is 10x bigger than all gold everything
hiphopheads,3dze8f,poonslayer941,3,Mon Jul 20 21:16:12 2015 UTC,yes because people always make jokes about his eye and hes proven he can make songs just as good if not better than trap queen all he needs to do is release on every once in a while before you know it Fetty Wap is considered G.O.A.T
hiphopheads,3dze8f,romanreignsWWECHAMP,5,Mon Jul 20 21:23:49 2015 UTC,GOAT? uh calm down
hiphopheads,3dze8f,sendphotopls,44,Tue Jul 21 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"Anyone peep that new Thundercat EP The Beyond / Where The Giants Roam? It's really damn good. I never really got too into Apocalypse, but this EP hits the spot. Haven't seen much discussion on it either."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,PotatoFam,28,Mon Jul 20 20:11:04 2015 UTC,"It's not really hip-hop, even if he is associated with Brainfeeder. He is crazy live though. Me and some friends ran into him at a pizza hut before he opened for flying lotus a couple years ago.   We offered to smoke him out, but he said he only drinks and does shrooms lol."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,11,Mon Jul 20 20:41:21 2015 UTC,Brainfeeder is mostly electronic music anyway though innit?
hiphopheads,3dze8f,Swamp85,13,Mon Jul 20 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but stuff like Flylo can be called instrumental hip-hop, given his influences. Not to mention Captain Murphy."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:56:26 2015 UTC,stuff like Samiyam is hip-hop tho.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,itwasmeornot,7,Mon Jul 20 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Hahahah man that sounds like a blast. I know Thiundercat isn't hip-hop, but I thought he would get a little discussion considering how associated with hip-hop he is. He was all over Kendrick's last album and plenty of FlyLo albums."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,PotatoFam,8,Mon Jul 20 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd wager that most people don't really listen to jazz on here. Otherwise I would expect people to be freaking out over Kamasi Washington. He was all over TPAB too.   On the topic of Thundercat, I just want him to work on his songwriting. His instrumental and vocal skill can't be denied, I just rarely revisit any of his stuff."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,4,Mon Jul 20 21:03:16 2015 UTC,The Epic was dope as hell. I'm tryna go see him live next month.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,dyurk,6,Mon Jul 20 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Them Changes became one of my favorite songs of the year, that fucking bass line and oh man I actually really like thundercats vocals on that song, sounds a lot like miguel. Idk just felt too short, even for an ep, like a lot of unfinished ideas. Also, like on apocalypse, thundercat's vocals can be very hit or miss, especially when he goes into a higher register. Them changes and lone wolf and cub are radical tho."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,zented,4,Mon Jul 20 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"It's great. Only 17 minutes people, listen to it. If you liked his work with FlyLo or Kendrick you'll like it. He's worked on Faces, Kismet, and INNANETAPE as well."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,rebrownd,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:02 2015 UTC,"I listened to 'Them Changes' having never listened to his solo work before and immediately bought the EP. I really enjoy it, I think it's short and sweet. 'Them Changes' kind of reminds me a more soulful Starfucker song, the whole EP is a pretty sweet mixture of R&B and 'indie' influences."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,Glowwerms,29,Tue Jul 21 08:09:37 2015 UTC,"Has anyone caught Earl since IDLSIDGO dropped? Just got a ticket to see him. I'm sure Run the Jewels will be crazy too.   Anyone who has a chance to see Death Grips, fucking do it. Just get up front and enjoy the best pit ever. Better than Lightning Bolt and Melt Banana.   People need to listen to the new l'Orange and Jeremiah Jae album. It's Jae's best project yet, and I'd honestly compare it to Madvillainy at least thematically. Check out Ice Obsidian, the bass fucking killed me."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,17,Mon Jul 20 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has a chance to see Death Grips, fucking do it.   I fucking wish. They're not coming anywhere bear me as far as I know though. Seeing Death Grips is on my concert bucket list though.   People need to listen to the new l'Orange and Jeremiah Jae album.   I only really liked L'Orange's production on here. Jerimiah Jae is a pretty uninteresting rapper I think."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,PotatoFam,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:59 2015 UTC,He fucking spits on tracks like The Concrete Some Call Home and All I Need. I used to feel the same way and only fucked with him because of his beat selection. His laid back flow on this album really vibes with me.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:09:25 2015 UTC,"laid back flow on this album   no doubt, ive heard a couple heads knock him over it (im lookin at you /u/tittycloud) but I think its dope bc it still allows the damn near pristine production from L'O get its proper shine."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,blovedDestroyer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"It just feels effortless, like curren$y but not consistently disappointing and with good features"
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"it really does feel effortless, and thats part of the reason I like it, because when he says something dope it hits harder. that roc marci effect"
hiphopheads,3dze8f,itwasmeornot,6,Mon Jul 20 23:33:54 2015 UTC,"I saw Earl in April, he played all of IDLS straight, then played some Doris and random songs. Ended it by doing his verse in orange juice 4 times. Hella good show, a lot better than I thought it'd be."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,HasheemThabeetGOAT,4,Mon Jul 20 20:38:31 2015 UTC,"Saw Earl & RTJ within 2 days of each other at the end of May. Earl was as great live as his music can be, it's not exactly always the most hyped up (Joey Badass was on straight after who probably isn't as talented but is just one huge ball of NYC energy). He played a great mix of his material though, old & new. Get ready to scream the hook to Molasses it's the most fun song he plays.   Was my second time seeing RTJ and they were yet again amazing. Get ready to go fucking wiiiiiillldddd."

hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:02 2015 UTC,yeah I was at that show!  Jesus fuck it felt like it was 120 in there.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,Poogie13,6,Tue Jul 21 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I ended up buying a shirt just to have something not sweat soaked to wear. Also ended up getting with this chick I know after running into her in the pit. Thanks to death grips for driving hormones wild. All in all a great fucking show."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,NicolasBroaddus,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Better than Lightning Bolt? Big words. I'm tryna catch DG at Riot Fest in August, missed them when they came to town first."

hiphopheads,3dze8f,Vwalker119,19,Tue Jul 21 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"Saw Rae Sremmurd, Meek Mill, and then Nicki on Friday for the Pinkprint tour. Shit was fucking lit. I fully recommend catching the show if they come to your city."

hiphopheads,3dze8f,CasterMojave,6,Mon Jul 20 20:38:28 2015 UTC,He's really good but he doesn't have many classic albums because he raps over a lot of boring beats. Reminds me a lot of Canibus. Soul on Ice is great though. What did you think of Nature of the Threat?
hiphopheads,3dze8f,PaddyPooHead,3,Mon Jul 20 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"Amazing, top tier lyrics (for his early career at least). Everything else is kind of garbage. Works for me though he was my favorite rapper for awhile and I still love his prime stuff. ""Interview with the Vampire"" one of my favorite tracks ever tbh.   He's one of the guys where you're probably better off reading the lyrics lmao"

I really thought it was great, had a dope feature by Future, and he did a really great job of keeping up with the change in hip hop on the mixtape. Mardi Gras 2 is leagues ahead of FWA/SFTW2  Also whatever happened to the weekly artist discussions? We should bring that back up, maybe not with dudes like Kanye/Eminem that everyone knows but some lesser known guys"
hiphopheads,3dze8f,aacarbone,6,Mon Jul 20 20:59:58 2015 UTC,beats were meh and from there its only so far up you can go.  needs more mannie/better producers in general.  juvie still got it tho dont get it twisted.  the ainchu verse plus his verse on the lemme find out lemix were on point
hiphopheads,3dze8f,murdahmamurdah,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:28 2015 UTC,Only listened to it a couple times but I really enjoyed it. I'm guessing that Future feature was a swap for Juvie's feature on Future's Beast Mode tape.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,FrenchQuaker,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:42 2015 UTC,I liked Mardi Gras 2. Got a lot of great verses on there from Juvie. He got the Cash Money kids on there too and surprisingly they didn't ruin songs but actually were able to do their thing. I agree way better than all of Weezys tapes from this year.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,Chrussell,12,Mon Jul 20 20:01:12 2015 UTC,Most disappointing release this year? For me it would be Surf or Cherry Bomb.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,whodatbae,25,Mon Jul 20 20:31:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely Cherry Bomb. Haven't listened to any joint on there again except for Smuckers.
hiphopheads,3dze8f,C34,8,Mon Jul 20 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"Fuck man - I REALLY don't get the hate here. Before this year I used to totally agree with 90% of the HHH opinions but holy shit I LOVED cherry bomb and ALLA. I mean, Fucking Young? 2Seater? those tracks are fucking BEAUTIFUL! Blow my Load was excellent, Smuckers of course as well as Brown Stains then Okaga is a fucking beautiful outro.   As for ALLA - Holy Ghost is an UNREAL intro, Canal St. is fucking hauting as well as Fine Whine. Absolutely LOVED Excuse Me and L$D as well as Wavybone and M'$.   Rocky was right, he's not a rapper anymore he's an artist and I really think Tyler is too. Neither of those works were anything like their presceding works however both albums are incredibly powerful pieces of music that I absolutely loved.   I'd really suggest giving both another listen. Don't listen to them as hip-hop albums either - just listen to them as albums."
hiphopheads,3dze8f,dickinamasonjar,3,Mon Jul 20 21:17:43 2015 UTC,"I thought general consensus was that ALLA was pretty god damned good?   Also in regards to Cherry Bomb I kind of agre; it's a good fuckin' album.  I think the whole thing with the vocal mixing being whack threw a lot of people off.  I fucked with it though, reminded me of a mix between Wolf & Bastard."

hiphopheads,3dxit7,Waymond206,55,Mon Jul 20 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah everyone is talking about whether Action went too far or not but how about the fact that the venue needs to make the artist feel safe while performing. Fans running around like this should never happen nor should he have ever made it all the way around front. Also, I have no problem with any artist interpreting a fan coming on stage as an act of aggression. Don't wanna get body slammed like Plies or worse."

hiphopheads,3dxit7,kcmjustchillin,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"There's no way paying someone like that is worth that footage. Let alone the PR disaster it would be if the person that was paid outted him. Besides, maybe I'm wrong, but I've been a fan of Bronson for years now and one thing I love most about him is his authenticity. I always believe this dude is being himself and a stunt like that just isn't in his repertoire.  Edit: Also, security would have to be in on it not to take the kid down. They would have to know to specifically not do their jobs right when this one fan runs on stage. This means the venue would have to be down with this as well, which seems pretty unlikely. Liability and what not, idk I'm not a lawyer. Even so, as I mentioned originally, one of those security guards or venue owners could come out and say Bronson staged something this and ruining Bronson's rep.  It just seems wayyyyy too unlikely. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt it."

I'm pretty tall so it rarely effects me, but I understand everyone else's frustration. I also think using your phone to record a show puts another barrier between you and the performance, and I feel like the experience is enhanced for everyone if fewer people are invested in their phones. But we do live in 2015, and it's so easy to record something so it's going to happen. Also I love finding recordings of shows I've been to or wanted to attend on YouTube.

hiphopheads,3dxit7,therain_maker,112,Tue Jul 21 06:15:35 2015 UTC,You don't see Bronson running into this dudes office while he is working and standing in front of his computer monitor like a hippo with Alzheimers. Let the dude do his thing. I don't see anything wrong with the way he handles the situation; this kid is essentially taking away from everyone else who wants to enjoy the show.

Its not a conspiracy. Teenagers cant sue because they willingly put themselves in harms way by breaking venue rules (and im sure a law) by climbing up on the stage, after that Action can just claim self defense that a random person who could be anybody rushed him on stage and got past security so he felt threatened.   Its far more likely another incident on teenagers wanting attention and a reaction which they know they will get since Action always does these types of things. Teenagers do much worse for attention so isolated idiots spread out over weeks/months doesn't surprise me in the slightest."

hiphopheads,3dxit7,kcmjustchillin,2,Tue Jul 21 01:52:33 2015 UTC,Are these things staged? I don't understand how Bronson does this and people love it but when someone like Travis Scott makes people jump back into the crowd for getting up on the stage you guys just rail on the dude.
hiphopheads,3dxit7,ClevelandNights,14,Tue Jul 21 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"Idk how you even compare the two or don't understand the difference. People run on stage, Bronson usually throws them off, that's the end of it. Usually doesn't even stop the song.  Travi$ jumps in the crowd, has his shoe removed, gets it back, then encourages people to beat the shit out of said fan and basically stops the show over it.  There's also been other times of such incidents where he seems to borderline assault people that have paid money to come watch him perform.  Every time this bullshit happens to Bronson, he rarely lets it interrupt his show. Sure he hates it and usually beats or throws the person off stage or to security, but he will never let it bring his show to halt. He's all about a good performance not beating down someone who got out of line."
hiphopheads,3dxit7,MyLastThrowaway1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, I'm not condoning either artist's actions. But how is what Travis does any worse than, say, the time Bronson body slammed that guy? Also, don't act like Travis picks out random people in the crowd who aren't doing anything to get pissed at. It's someone who is giving him a reason to be angry specifically because it's stopping him from putting on a good show. What he does isn't right, but I'm not understanding why he gets hate while Bronson gets a pass for doing the similar things."
hiphopheads,3dxit7,kcmjustchillin,9,Mon Jul 20 14:52:33 2015 UTC,Because throwing one punch and removing someone that could cause harm to you from the stage is not nearly as bad as demanding that a mob of people that you can't control beat the shit out of a guy that tried to give you your shoe back.
hiphopheads,3dxit7,MortalJazz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not condoning either actions either, but I'm just saying that Action does it quick and it's over, the situation doesn't linger. Maybe someone will get hurt someday and that'll change but I doubt it since it's never OK to run on stage at any concert ever.   Travi$ just tends to have a tendency to further the situation and perhaps even make it worse rather than just dealing with it quick and deescalating the whole situation entirely."

I still enjoy both artist's material now but if they went back to their best project's sound, I'd enjoy it even more."
hiphopheads,3e0y7x,Retro_23,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like Drake could pump 10 of these songs a day. He really doesn't say much in this song, but is it ever good."
hiphopheads,3e0y7x,TheGraded,3,Tue Jul 21 06:14:19 2015 UTC,Oh shit I didn't see this before I posted mine.
hiphopheads,3e0y7x,I_cant_feel_myface,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"I really like the hook and Drake's first verse but after that it's pretty bad really. This might be the worst Bun B verse I've ever heard, I hate to say cringey but hearing Bun trying to imitate Drake and Wayne is just bad. The iBomb line in particular stands out.  Also not Wayne's best performance. I usually didn't mind his autotune but this is tough to listen through. In theory, a 6 minute collab from the 3 of them should be great but I usually skip this song after Drake does the hook for the first time. Really is a shame, because this song could be so much better."

hiphopheads,3dymk0,RamonaParkLegend,30,Mon Jul 20 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised they picked a track without Royce to push as a single with a video but I like it. Part of what made House Rules such a great tape imo was that they didn't force all 4 members on every track and it let each member shine on tracks like Illmind Interlude, Trade it all and Keep it 100. As much as I love the tracks where all 4 of them go in, it's pretty refreshing and welcome to see a video where the 3 less popular members get to shine."

hiphopheads,3dymk0,Ray229harris,10,Mon Jul 20 22:52:02 2015 UTC,I'm so excited for Glass House. Apparently this song AND Y'all Ready Know were leftovers from the album. If Slaughterhouse stops trying to be radio friendly and just does what they do best (lyricism) I think they'll be way more successful.

hiphopheads,3dzd20,skillmau5,9,Tue Jul 21 01:41:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, I understand he's trying to ""preach positivity"" but like a good majority of his discography is about killing dudes and whatnot soo....."
hiphopheads,3dzd20,itcantbefornothing,15,Tue Jul 21 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"Which makes the turn around that much more important. If someone like chief keef preaches anti violence then it affects the audience that is violent. Like, if the pope came out and said ""gang violence is bad"" then he'd be preaching to the choir, literally. But kids in Chicago listen to chief keef which is what makes it important. You feel me?"
hiphopheads,3dzd20,skillmau5,4,Tue Jul 21 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of it has to do with environment these kids are growing up in though, these kids aren't going to put guns down because Chief Keef told them too. Infact, wasn't Durk's manager killed right after he tried doing the ""no more guns"" thing? Also I don't understand what you mean about keef preaching anti violence, if he's going to be performing his own music. I remember reading something about him wanting to step away from violent music, but even recent songs, like iCarly which came out last week has the lyrics ""I was totin' on a glocky /Ready for a opp-y/So I could poppy/Leave his ass on the concrete"". I don't know man, I understand his music is showing the sad truth about his life and the kids growing up in that area and how they perceive things, but it's still nothing I would perform if I was wanting to STOP violence. As Lupe Fiasco said,""Chief Keef scares me.Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents,"".  Forgive me for inaccuracies because i'm not a huge Keef fan, I'm just basing this off recent things I've read."
