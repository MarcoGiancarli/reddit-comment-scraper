Mustang,3e3dlr,steve-oh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:21 2015 UTC,Has he had it dynoed? (Depending on boost) I don't think with those mods he will be near 1000.  I'm thinking more around 800.  Do you know what injectors he is running?  With 70#+ and E85 he might be squeaking out 850.  Is he worried about the precious oil pressure gauge going puh yet?  Nice pic - I love when they unload between the 3-4 shift.  Was he on the rev limiter?  *edits for more questions
Mustang,3e3dlr,steve-oh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"Hasn't had it dynoed yet. But with his old set up he dynoed 777 to the rear wheels, that was with old blower, running lower boost, stock throttle body, stock manifolds, etc. Since then he's built the aluminator, added the new blower, changed pulleys around, ceramic coated long tubes, ported throttle body, port matched the intake and various other things. There's nothing stock left under the hood now"

Mustang,3e2kvb,YesThatMrNiceGuy,12,Tue Jul 21 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"I have a (non car related) similar story. I was walking through the mall one Sunday afternoon with my wife. We both have our carry permits but I wasn't carrying that day as my permit still showed an old address.  So its about 5pm, an hour before close, and the mall is deserted except for this one very large, fully bearded and afro'd black man. I'm a fairly big dude, 6'3 220, but this guy is even bigger. This man is making a b line for me. I start to walk wide and he turns and keeps coming at me.  My wife and I split to walk in a big circle around him and he turns again, still coming straight at me with one hand jammed way down in his pocket.  Now, my wife was carrying and fully capable of putting an end to this guy, but on general principle I would prefer a fistfight to a shooting- provided this man doesn't have a weapon in his pocket.  He stops a couple feet away and says ""Hey,"" and I give him a firm and angry ""WHAT?""  He says, in a very high pitched and squeaky voice, ""will you come to gamestop with me? I need someone over 18 to sign for my trade in.""  So I went and signed, and felt like a dick."

I was at the Mustangs northwest Roundup last weekend (Met Kevin Marti and Steve Saleen!) and a local Ford Dealer had a 2015 Premium 50th anniversary and a 2013 Boss 302 Laguna Seca available! I would have to drive this car to work, so the 2015 was very appealing to me, plus it was $20 grand less!"

A testament to Ford in a sense.   Can I ask if you had any major issues along your climb to 200k? Not counting accidents of course because those aren't usually the car's fault.

Overall, I've replaced the O2 sensors twice, the IAC, the EGR, the TPS, rebuilt the distributor to replace the PIP inside, and replaced all the rubber vacuum hoses due to leaks.  I'm on my second cooling fan (the last one froze up), I forget how many radiators and I've replaced the water pump once.  However, nothing major so far (crosses fingers).  The engine internals are still original.  I always use Mobil 1 5w30 Synthetic and change the oil every 3k-4k miles.  If the engine starts acting quirky, I try to fix it as soon as I can so the quirks don't cause more damage later on."

I was a little apprehensive about taking the mustang since I'd never driven it more than an hour or so at a time, but holy crap, what an awesome road trip car! I could not be happier with it. Ride, mpg, etc. It was all fantastic.  We drove the Pacific Coast Highway up through Big Sur, and although it was raining some I still got to enjoy the twisty oceanside roads. The drive back home was highways/freeways the entire way, and I was really impressed at how the mustang handled cruising. Road noise was pretty high, naturally, but I didn't feel jarred around a lot.  Also, a plug for adaptive cruise control. This was the first time I had used it, and wow, what a cool thing to have. Ford knocked their implementation out of the park. So smooth and perfect. For general highway driving I just set it and didn't have to worry about the constant give and go when passing slower traffic or getting caught behind a semi. It was so cool."

A number of people in the forums complained about the stock shifter, but I only encountered an occasional issue when I was giving it my all accelerating and sometimes 2nd just was a pain to get into but during normal driving, aside from the cupholders being in the way of the shifter, it was very simple.  I keep hill assist off on my cars, but if you are stopped at a light and are on a hill, it's much easier that way. As far as learning at the dealership, I don't know about that. I would not want to buy a car someone had been learning on (despite how little it should affect things).  Good luck!"

I'm sure they'll give you half an hour or whatever, enough to get comfortable enough to take the car out and drive it around some back roads. Hell, if you're still nervous, I'm sure they'll let you take out a smaller, used Focus or whatever, something you wont be so nervous to drive. You're buying a 2014 Performance car....they'll do whatever they need to to make the sale. Oh, and by the way, you're absolutely making the right choice by going with a manual. Don't get an automatic and regret it later, just because the first 2 hours of driving a stick is a little nerve racking. You'll thank yourself later when you're pounding gears at 5500RPM!"

Mustang,3e2hyn,zip_zap_zip,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. My girlfriend tried learning on my '05 and it was a nightmare for her. The clutch (at least on mine) is very tight, which makes it a lot harder to gradually let out. Also, it's a very loud car which can freak someone out if they aren't prepared.

I mostly learned on the 40 miles home.:)  Every car is different. My 09 fit had a feather light clutch that I didn't like. My 94 ranger had the worst transmission ever, but it was easy to shift.  The 2014 mustang gt I just sold was actually pretty easy. The clutch may be a bit on the heavy side compared to most modern cars (nothing like my 89) and it has hill assist. I found it very easy to drive, but you really need to fully depress the clutch for each shift to re-engage it, and power shifting in that car needs to more deliberate and less fast than most."

Ok when I did detailing at a car dealership for a summer I tried to drive a manual car in to the bay to wash it but I don't think I even got it in there and had a co worker help me.  But I plan on learning how to drive a manual with my Cobra with my brother or mother teaching me.
Mustang,3e2hyn,t3s3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"I actually just picked up a '13 GT as my first stick car ever (pics up on this sub coming soon!), and just this weekend learned on a 3-hour drive home in traffic. I'm not going to lie and say it's been easy so far, the clutch is pretty heavy and picky, but at the same time the Coyote has a lot of grunt, so it's not impossible for sure. So much about driving stick is different, your approach to traffic, stop-signs, parking lots, so make sure you've gotten yourself ready for that before you drive any manual car.  Something to consider too, if you care about this car, you do not want to learn on it. I guarantee that you will stall/grind a gear/ride the clutch at least once when you are learning, and it sucks to have just gotten a car and to know you are doing damage to it. I guess my suggestion is to do what you can to get proficient in driving stick before getting your Coyote, I wish I had."
Mustang,3e2hyn,uvebeenrekt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:02 2015 UTC,I learned on my '14. It went fine. When I went to the dealership I test drove an auto.
Mustang,3e2hyn,MaximusNeo701,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:13 2015 UTC,I know you said you feel putting an auto transmission on a muscle car is  a shame. But you should remember the transmissions on a car that new will be faster than even most professional drivers. Yes there will still be an elite group of awesome drivers able to do it better but I would assume that if you are learning you are like me in the 90% of not awesome manual drivers and would actually perform better in an automatic. The auto in my 13 is amazing; but the traction control is what really stops it from accelerating quickly turning that off makes a very noticeable difference.

Mustang,3e0gq2,BHORNBECK,7,Tue Jul 21 00:28:48 2015 UTC,The booty on the 2014s 😍 and that color too!!
Mustang,3e0gq2,NitroXityRealm,3,Tue Jul 21 01:53:53 2015 UTC,No one gets me when I say I got the 14 for the rear end! Glad someone does!
Mustang,3e0gq2,iTomJ,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:51 2015 UTC,Love the booty! 😍
Mustang,3e0gq2,NitroXityRealm,7,Tue Jul 21 02:12:12 2015 UTC,Best tail lights out of any car ever imo
Mustang,3e0gq2,Spydos,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:25 2015 UTC,The taillights grabbed my attention the first time I saw them!
Mustang,3e0gq2,Prison_Vape,-3,Tue Jul 21 02:36:29 2015 UTC,The LFA would like a word with you.
Mustang,3e0gq2,Prison_Vape,7,Tue Jul 21 03:54:47 2015 UTC,2014 is better in my opinion.
Mustang,3e0gq2,Prison_Vape,2,Tue Jul 21 01:38:22 2015 UTC,There's details I like from each. But the color on this one is what got me the most. Love the blue.
Mustang,3e0gq2,Prison_Vape,7,Tue Jul 21 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"It is rather beautiful. Personally, I just never jumped on the S550 train. They look great in person, sound good too.  But I never fell in live with them. Cool car, but the 2014 is one I fell in love with. The Coyote and Cyclone motors are amazing."
Mustang,3e0gq2,Z20,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:03 2015 UTC,"I fell in love with the S550 but since my car quit a little earlier than planned, I had to look elsewhere and when I saw this one, I fell in love again. Only 15,000 miles on it and drives great."
Mustang,3e0gq2,Alexithymia,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely something to be proud of. Now, all She needs is a name!"
Mustang,3e0gq2,jdhbigdog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:38:44 2015 UTC,The hardest part is the name!
Mustang,3e0gq2,jdhbigdog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:26:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.
Mustang,3e0gq2,TheDrewzy,6,Tue Jul 21 05:34:58 2015 UTC,2014s better anyways!
Mustang,3e0c9e,fisherb89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:34 2015 UTC,Fox Body owners = Chevy guys at heart.  j/k nice ride
