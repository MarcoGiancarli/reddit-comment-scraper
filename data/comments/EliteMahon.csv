Sandro Sammarco explained the formula below:  https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=168230&page=6&p=2567857&viewfull=1#post2567857  The original display of the formula is confusing. From a design perspective FD's decision makes logical sense and they have explained what they want to achieve for powerplay. Profitable systems have always been the logical choice from the beginning and it has proved to be the correct strategy.  There are still several systems worth at least 70 profit that can be taken in the coming weeks. With some coordination and focus we can push Mahon to be the number 1 power by a sizable margin.

EliteMahon,3dqrao,Chef-Jitsu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"As noted, you can still usually access outposts. This allows you to cash in bounties and trade. The minor faction and major faction standings should be more or less additive, so if you're just-by-just hostile, having the minor faction like you even a bit should make you unfriendly to them - and then things get a lot easier.  Bounty hunting can be a little bit difficult in systems with cops, since the Federal Security Service will attack you. However, check anarchic systems (preferably with Federal factions) and carry a Kill Warrant Scanner if you want to bounty hunt. It might be even possible to bounty hunt in an Alliance system with a Federal minor faction and get Fed bounties with a Kill Warrant Scanner. Tiethay and Arque should fit the bill. The rings in Tiethay don't show by default - either carry a discovery scanner or then you probably can buy the data in Alioth or some surrounding system. (Arque is a bit iffy, because the Fed faction is very powerful - Arque and Turdetani might even flip Fed, unless we're careful.)"

EliteMahon,3daq7y,shrinkshooter,3,Tue Jul 14 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"Here is the clarification given by Frontier on how merit decay is supposed to work: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=163495   I’ve also just been asked to clarify how merit decay is supposed to work. Before I start, I want to point out that we’ve just discovered a potential quirk in the system which could have been giving some odd results, causing some of the confusion about this mechanic! Hopefully we’ll be identifying (and banishing) this gremlin if tracked down – keep a weather eye for updates.  So, here’s how merit decay should work, using an example of you being a Commander newly pledged to a power, who will be earning 10 merits per cycle from activities completed in each cycle:  At the end of the first cycle, you will have earned 10 merits. These merits are used to determine your Rating for the next cycle.  At the end of the second cycle, still assuming that you’re earning 10 merits for tasks each cycle, you’ll have 10 merits from activities in cycle two, and the merits you earned in cycle one will be added again, only at half value, meaning that you’d have a total of 15 merits (10 from cycle two and 10/2 from cycle one) used to determine you rating for the next cycle.  At the end of cycle three, you would be earning merits from activities from that cycle, plus merits earned from cycle two at half value, and merits from cycle one at a quarter value.  So if you earned 10 merits per cycle, in cycle three you would have 17.5 merits (10 from cycle three, 10/2 from cycle two and 10/4 from cycle one).  This trend continues; in its fourth cycle, merits are still awarded, only at an eighth of their original value. So, in our example, with 10 merits being earned each cycle, at the end of cycle four the merit total would be 18.75 (10 from cycle four, 10/2 from cycle three, 10/4 from cycle two and 10/8 from cycle one).  Merits are completely removed from your total on their fifth cycle, so in our example, merits earned from cycle one would be completely removed from cycle four, leaving us the same total of 18.75 (10 from cycle five, 10/2 from cycle four, 10/4 from cycle three, 10/8 from cycle two and zero from cycle one, as these merits have been removed).  The bug we suspect might exist would mean that the merit total isn’t being halved (or not always halved) on cycle two of its life span, instead being added again at full value. On cycle three it is being halved and on cycle four it is being quartered. It is still being completely removed on cycle five.  The upshot of this is that Commanders could be earning more merits than they should be: not the end of the world, but as clearly noticed, inconsistent and potentially confusing, it’s something we’re investigating."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,XHawk87,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link. It now seems even Frontier is confused about this. According to how that dev claims it's ""supposed"" to work, you would indeed require 5,334 merits per cycle to stay at rank 5. The thing that gets me there is that he keeps saying ""merit total"" but he isn't TALKING about the merit total, he's only talking about merits earned that cycle.  He's saying that at 10 merits/week, by end of cycle 3 you'll have 17.5 merits. That only works if you're using the 1/2 earned merits mechanic, which gives you 10 at the end of C1, then 10 + 5 = 15 at the end of C2, then 10 + 5 + 2.5 = 17.5 at the end of C3.  The 1/2 TOTAL merits mechanics means 10 merits at the end of cycle 1, then 10 + 5 = 15 at the end of cycle 2, then 10 + (15/2) + (10/4) = 20 at the end of C3.  It sounds like Frontier is saying something (""total merits"") without meaning it, and not understanding they're misusing a word. And of top of that, it sounds like they haven't even considered the ""half the flat total merits"" option, but instead attribute a bug to merits being shifted in full one whole cycle."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,freeelancer86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:19:47 2015 UTC,"You are correct. They are misusing the term ""total merits"" and should use ""merits earned"" instead.  But your formula is wrong, at least in my case. I need around 3500 merits now that my rank has stabilized in order to remain r5, which does coincide with what FD have said and what some other players are experiencing as well.  If FD doesn't fuck up again, we should see the mythic 5334 become a reality."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,mnyiaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:59:48 2015 UTC,"yes. if what Mr. Sammarco said really is how it's supposed to work, then the 5334 number really will become needed to stay at rank 5.

EliteMahon,3daq7y,m---p,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:38:02 2015 UTC,They should have make it  W1 = 10000(farmed) W2 = 7500 (1/4) W3 = 5000 (2/4) W4 = 2500 (3/4)  So in this example if you farm 5000 every week(from w2) then you'll end up with 12500 every week. Which means you'll be able to farm less than 5000 to maintain 10000.  They just took the most retarded way to award merits and made it totally impossible for casual players. Merits decay way too fast.

EliteMahon,3daq7y,John_Geary,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/s0c89fv.jpg  This is formatted better than reddit allowed.  From what I noticed with my merits, every week's merits are divided individually.   If you make 10k in your first week, then for your 2nd 3rd 4th week you only need to make 5k in each week. After that, it fluctuates, but essentially it get's harder to keep your rank.  It's impossible to make the same amount of merits every week and keep the same total number of merits.  Week's merits lasts 4 weeks(includes the week it was farmed in). So week 1's merits are divided 3 times.  Example: W1: 1000 w2: 500+500 w3:250+250+(500 newly farmed) =1000 w4:125+125+250+(500 newly farmed) =1000 w5: 0+62.5+125+250+(500 newly farmed) = 937.5 w6: 0+0+62.5+125+250+(500 newly farmed) = 937.5 w7: 0+0+0+62.5+125+250+(500 newly farmed) =937.5 w8: 0+0+0+0+62.5+125+250+(500 newly farmed) = 937.5 w9: 0+0+0+0+0+62.5+125+250+(500 newly farmed) = 937.5  They talk about halving the end of week total, but they don't adjust for the 5th week's drop of 1st week's merits. All merits last a total of 4week(including the week that they were farmed.) That is why they have 10, 5, 2.5, 1.5, 0  So if you farm the exact same amount every week, at the 5th week you no longer make enough to keep original started amount.  They half all merits for 3 weeks only, in the 4th week they are no longer halved.  So it's easier to think: Week 1 = farm Week 2 = w1 is half Week 3 = w2 is half Week 4 = w3 is half Week 5 = none"
EliteMahon,3daq7y,younger5th,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your image is easier to read.  What your math describes there is the ""1/2 earned merits"" model, as opposed to the ""1/2 total merits"" model. In order to stay at 1000 merits under what you're using, you'd need 534 a week. That's where the 5,334/week number comes from when we talk about rank 5."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,CMDR_Smooticus,3,Wed Jul 15 14:39:30 2015 UTC,Jesus christ why did they have to create such a confusing system.

EliteMahon,3daq7y,8yearsbehind,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"The thirty cycles are obviously hypothetical. There is an example for the 10 merits per week as mentioned by FD, and the ""half of earned merits"" calculation totally works with FD's results.  The example from OP though doesn't work with the ""half of the total merits of the week"" calculation.  Maybe I don't get how your equation actually works, but until you proof the 10 merits example works with it, I guess my calculation can't be disputed."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,mnyiaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"I guess I should be clearer here: the image you posted originally is a link to a hypothetical list of merits earned over 30 cycles. Since that isn't real data, we can't use that as a basis for anything, unless you're telling me that the first 6 cycles is actually data you collected yourself from the game. The ""10 merits per week"" thing you're talking about is an example posted by Sandro on the Elite Forums claiming that's how it's supposed to work, but again that's not collected data.  From that table you just posted, it looks like you did your math right in the ""half the total"" model. I don't have an example in the OP dealing with 10 merits/week, unless you're referring to the other post in this thread where I replied to Xhawk, yes, i put 10/2 instead of 10/4 there. My mistake, you're right. It comes out to 20 total merits, as it shows in your sheet, as opposed to 17.5, which is how Sandro says it's ""supposed"" to work.  is there anythig i haven't addressed?"
EliteMahon,3daq7y,Acceleratio,2,Wed Jul 15 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer. I actually have my own collected data and it followed the y = (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4)x equation. It worked absolutely fine til now. The problem is - and I think we misunderstood each other at this point of discussion - that FD announced a correction of a bug. And their description of bug and fix plus their ""10 merits per week"" example indicates, that the old equation (as seen above) just get shifted and will look like this: y = (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8)x. It'd all fit, including the powerplay manual description about merit decay. We just have to ignore the word ""total"", which seems to have another meaning for the people of FD."
EliteMahon,3daq7y,younger5th,2,Wed Jul 15 15:24:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, that greatly clears things up. I made a document sheet linked in the OP with both models, I suppose I'll leave that there until we end next cycle and see what happens to the numbers. It does sound like they're going to make players grind for 5334 every week to stay on top...I doubt when the change comes and people have a harder time with it (that's a ridiculous number) FD will keep it. Maybe they will, who knows, but that's going to be a lot of time and effort spent on staying at that rank; people will barely even be playing a game at that point. :/  thanks for the data regardless, it's very illuminating"

EliteMahon,3db0ae,uuicon,9,Tue Jul 14 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Hi Murp, thanks for starting the sub. When PP started I didnt really have the time to figure out how everything will work, and I was super excited to find this Sub.  Since then I've learned so much through other people's efforts (unpacking PP mechanics, all the charts and fancy math, trade routs etc.), and I've invested a little bit of time here, working on rares trading routes in Alliance space etc (busy writing another one now for Anaconda).  I see that there are a lot of people not happy with E:D and with FD also.  But other people are relatively satisfied (like me). I've played Elite since 1984, I've always expected to get what we have now. Also, I believe that FD will continue to improve the game etc. etc. I am also in the software industry, so that maybe allows me some additional empathy for developers / humans and their general failings.    That all being said.  You did a wonderful thing by starting this Sub, it attracted me, and many other CMDRs. Each time I log in here (about 3x per day) we have 15-20 people online, the Sub has 500+ followers. A lot of people are putting effort in here, including making regular weekly submissions etc. etc. All the posts that I have written have been cross-posted to Frontier Forums, Elite:Traders and such places. It allows me a little bit of personal satisfaction seeing my posts being useful to other people.  If anyone had to follow my links today, they'd see the Mod of the Sub being dissatisfied, and leaving.  This creates the impression that the sub will soon die. I am sure more and more people will buy Elite, and more and more people will stumble across this Sub.  Some of us will stay, others will move on eventually. But can I ask you to leave this sub in a way that will encourage those people who choose to stay involved and invest their time here,  on an even better foot than when you started it.  It would not be nice if Obama left at the end of his second term and said ""USA sucks I'm moving to Brazil"".  That would not good for the citizens of the US.

Can I respectfully ask you to edit or remove your post - I want to continue investing some of my energy here (almost done with my new Alliance trading route as I said), but it's not worth it if no-one returns - and seeing a post like yours from the Mod on the top of the page is not going to have a good effect for this thing you started - maybe nothing will happen, but on the balance of it maybe a few people will feel disheartened and act accordingly.  Tx again for your efforts. We will keep your seat warm until you return (which I'm sure you will once FD worked through all their growing pains)."
EliteMahon,3db0ae,freeelancer86,4,Wed Jul 15 06:14:58 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to say there is anything wrong with this sub or drive people away from it. I only have a problem with Frontier. If they ever improve, sure as hell I'll come back. And like I said, if other people enjoy the game that's fine by me. I'm only expressing my own opinions and whoever sees it can interpret it as they see it. It's as simple as that."
EliteMahon,3db0ae,itsonmute,2,Wed Jul 15 06:23:00 2015 UTC,"IMO taking a step back is a good call, I'm pretty much in the same boat. That being said, FD are promising super awesome stuff for Gamescom, which is in less then a month..   Now, personally, I've never believed the hype for anything, and especially not FD with their checkered history as far as ED development is concerned.. but if I were you, I'd keep an eye on the upcoming event. Who knows, maybe FD has a pleasant surprise in their sleeve.  In any case, good luck to you, appreciate what you've done for us. o7"

EliteMahon,3db0ae,NixHalcyon,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I do encourage other people to leave. I mean, if they enjoy their time in E:D, thats fine, so did I. I do NOT think they should support FD in it's current state, and I DO think that they should encourage that changes be made.    Also, of course I'm going to speak my opinion on the matter. I'm not going to speak kindly about a studio that I don't support.    EDIT: To clarify, I am not trying to make /r/EliteMahon look bad. We have done nothing I would be against. It is Frontier that I don't support."
EliteMahon,3db0ae,pATREUS,2,Tue Jul 14 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"That's ok. We all have our opinions. The game can be improved and there are plenty of arguments about how things in the game could be implimented. However, I still absolutely love this game. I mean, I can fly a freaking space ship around and see amazing things! I'll still support it and give Frontier my support as they are actively trying to make it better.  But as for now, I wish you well, Murp. Go and do what you love."
EliteMahon,3db0ae,Acceleratio,3,Wed Jul 15 12:26:14 2015 UTC,"What specifically are you unhappy about? You have said you don't like the direction? What direction? PP? Why do you not think the game is successful? If you don't want to play it, then don't play it I'm just curious as to why as this is a pretty general statement without pinpointing any real grievances."
EliteMahon,3db0ae,lightwarrior1111,5,Wed Jul 15 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for MURP but the reason I am also leaving is that Frontier continues to push features to support new buyers over fixing existing lack of game play.  I.e. they know that once you spend the $60 on the game, they don't need to give you anything and so they aren't adding depth to the game, they are adding branches for new buyers instead.  The game in its current state feels like a money grab.  I personally feel ripped off for having to pay full retail price for a game whose development was more than fully paid for by the fans (I expect to pay $60 for Fallout 4, not for a crowd funded project) and that isn't even 50% complete (actual available game play vs. features promised during crowd funding)  To be very specific about my gripe with the interestlevel of the game.  1) there is no strategy level to the gameplay at all.  No action taken by a specific player or group of players can ever have any impact on the galaxy in any meaningful way.  The only level of thought that needs to be put into the game is how to outfit your ship.  And all possible outfittings are only marginally different from each other. 2) When playing the game, there are forced gaps in the game play when approaching planets, flying to outlying systems, etc.  Where often for 20 minutes+ at a time you are expected as a player to not touch the controls or do anything at all, just sit and watch the tiny white dots streak past.  Nothing to look at, nothing to do, nothing to plan .... just sit there.  This is totally unacceptable game play and is light years behind the mechanism of jump drive from the original Elite game.  I am very curious where all the money went.  Did they piss it away tweaking the graphics to make it this pretty, instead of making the game play interesting, or is there a swimming pool full of $100 bills somewhere that Braben dives into so he can't hear the wails of dismay from the people playing the game?"

EliteMahon,3d6luu,Captain_Kirby_Aid,3,Mon Jul 13 22:47:43 2015 UTC,"I defected after 3 weeks at rank 5.   Being a mailman was okay while it felt new, but I am a bounty hunter not a trader, and even though I love the Alliance and would like to be part of it, I choose gameplay over roleplay.   I made a small profit, but in the end the constant grind was just too much for me. Even undermining stopped being fun after a while.  The merits fix will make things even worse, as I would have to spend even more time doing things I do not enjoy.  I rather listen to the BSG or Blade Runner soundtrack while blasting pirates to bits in a RES. It can be very Zen.   I see myself as a mercenary now. Even though I singed up with ALD, I bare no love for the Empire (don't even have an Imperial rank).  The moment the bounty hunting bonus goes away I am gone too.  Good luck, guys!  I hope that there will be a combat focused Alliance faction some day."

EliteMahon,3d6luu,CMDR_Gran_Solo,2,Tue Jul 14 08:29:37 2015 UTC,"For me, it will depends on the merit decay ...  If they changed it, I wont stay rank 5, so I guess my work for Mahon will decrease a lot.  But, we have a good position now. If we can teach our supporters to do fortification only, we can keep a nice rank with few efforts. Maybe with even no efforts at all."

EliteMahon,3d6luu,Peuwi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:57:49 2015 UTC,"With the new ~5,400 merits per week to maintain rank 5, I will fall down to rank 4 next week. I hope to stay on rank 4 by gaining 800 merits each week, but I won't be able to support Mahon as I did the last few weeks (don't have the bucks to buy all that paper).  I still love to fight for Mahon and the Alliance, and I'm proud I was part of our raise. Leesti, Bonitou, Naunin... There were a lot of big days (or nights). This is not the end, but a little cut. PP will recede in everyday life, but if the Alliance calls to arms, I'll be there.  For freedom!"
EliteMahon,3d6luu,CMDR_Smooticus,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"Just thought I should point out the ~5400/week myth. I've been at rank 5 for 3 weeks, it only takes about 3600/week to maintain."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,freeelancer86,5,Tue Jul 14 02:19:54 2015 UTC,They'll fix it this week. Or at least that's what they say.
EliteMahon,3d6luu,MartinSchou,3,Tue Jul 14 06:26:45 2015 UTC,"Just thought I should point out the ~5400/week myth.   This is a myth due to a bug.  Look at the powerplay manual.:   Your merit total from the previous cycle is halved then added to your current cycle value. After two cycles, its value is halved again before being added. After three cycles, the value is halved once more. After four cycles the value is no longer added.   This gives us a total of 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 or 1+7/8ths.  10,000 merits/(1+7/8) = 5,333+1/3.  This is where the ""myth"" comes from.   So where's the bug? Well, it seems that it's moving it one week down the line. So you end up with 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 2 + 7/8th. 10,000/(2+7/8ths) = 3,478.26.  Once this bug is fixed, staying at rank 5 (10,000) will require 5,334 merits/week. Rank 4 (1,500) will require 800 merits/week. Rank 3 (750) will require 400 merits per week. Rank 2 (100) will require 54 merits per week.  This also means that you can't just get to rank 5 and use some of your income to buy fortification merits. They cost Cr 10,000 a piece, so your 50,000,000 credits will only buy you 5,000 merits out of the 5,334 you need. This is good, because with the bug in play, staying at rank 5 is free (paying 34,790,000 cash) and nets you 15,210,000 credits on top of it, which means that the rich get richer while the poor have to do hard work.  Once the bug has been fixed, you need to actually work for your income."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,shrinkshooter,2,Tue Jul 14 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"Your math is wrong. I know because I made the same mistake you just did, made it two weeks ago, using the same formula, and then went back and found out where the hitch was.  You're assuming with this formula that you're only carrying one half the merits earned that week over into the next cycle. That's not what happens. You carry over ONE HALF THE TOTAL number of merits at the end of one cycle to the next. There is a cumulative effect, it's not a simple y = 1.875x formula, which is where you're getting that number.  Please correct your post so we don't constantly have this misinformation circling around."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,MartinSchou,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:27 2015 UTC,"You carry over ONE HALF THE TOTAL number of merits at the end of one cycle to the next.   If that was true, and the powerplay manual is also true, then you have no merits after week four.   After four cycles the value is no longer added.   Also note what I stated in the beginning - there is an acknowledge bug in the merit decay system, which has you carrying over too many merits from week to week. This is why the mistake you thought you made two weeks ago ended up giving you the incorrect result."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,shrinkshooter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"If that was true, and the powerplay manual is also true, then you have no merits after week four.   Yeah, and that's correct, providing you only earn merits for one week. 4 weeks later those merits will be gone. The point is that C2 carryover is 1/2 C1 total, and the C3 carryover is 1/2 C2 total + 1/4 C1 total. You're not contradicting my point at all.   there is an acknowledge bug in the merit decay system   and they also state they don't know what the bug is, and they take a shot in the dark, saying ""maybe it's a one cycle delay before decay."" Carrying over too many merits from one week to the next doesn't explain the incorrect result I originally obtained; in fact, it does the opposite."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,m---p,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"But it seems almost impossible for a guy with a rl job to gain 5,334 merits each week to maintain rank 5. With an average Type-7 or Python with 200 cargo you'll need about 28 trips; assuming a two-way-trip's duration was about 15 minutes (which would be quite fast and only worked for very close systems) you'd need about 7 hours non-stop trading and you'd lose money within that time. Each week. Have fun getting crazy, dude.. ;)  The ~3,600 merits/week felt OK though."

It's not that simple - if you were getting the required 3.5k merits with cash by say fortifying, it is 7 long round trips in a T9. A decent trader can make the 15M credits with a T9 in 7 normal trading runs, with much less chance of being shot at:)  So hardly free money.  Anyway, I'm one of the people who bought their way to Lv5, and due to the merit fix will be dropping down to Lv4, I've tried to justify Lv5 but I can't, and if I get out now at least I won't lose out.  However that is bad for PP and bad for Mahon, as I was one of the people who quietly fortify in the background..."
EliteMahon,3d6luu,younger5th,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:59:23 2015 UTC,"Compare it to not buying them.  At rating 5 you get 50 merits allocated every 30 minutes. You need (right now) 3,479 of them. That's 35 hours of waiting for the next batch to become available. I'm pretty sure those 7 ""long round trips"" are going to be done a lot quicker than those 35 hours of waiting for your quota.  Saving something like 30 hours of work to maintain your rank seems like a pretty good deal to me."

EliteMahon,3d3ad8,mnyiaa,3,Mon Jul 13 04:28:06 2015 UTC,"The top 2 systems, Namaka and Aasgaa, are complete crap and are being prepared by selfish merit-farmers and fifth columnists. In order to get them out of the top 10, we have to prepare 10 systems beyond beyond that.  At this point, that probably isn't going to happen. The main point of  preparing at this time is to make sure the 8 best systems make it into the top 10, with enough of a buffer that another poor system isn't pushed into the top 10 later on in the week."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,CMDR_Smooticus,3,Mon Jul 13 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"FD should introduce a method to downvote single systems in the preparation list.  Something like the nomination, but reverse :D  ... so the community is able to ban a single unwanted system with a combined effort. It's really annoying that we can do nothing about bad choices, now."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,cmdr_brac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:37:31 2015 UTC,"Would be good if nominations could be used for both up and down votes. e.g. downvoting Namaka would positively effect all the other systems whereas we can only effect one at a time under the current system.   The impact of merit farmers could be lowered if there was a 4th, neutral power commodity (not prep, expansion or control) at the top of the list. Everybody knows farmers don't scroll so they'd get to increase their rating as much as they like without damaging the power.  As for 5th columnists,  FD are already mentioning their effect in recent patches so hopefully they're thinking of ways their actions can be countered. i.e. Real life double agents are always at risk of being found out - would love to see a bit of espionage introduced to the game!"
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,itsonmute,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:17:41 2015 UTC,Sure would like to know who thought it was a good idea from the start. Probably the distance from HQ or control systems.

EliteMahon,3d3ad8,MartinSchou,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:09:25 2015 UTC,Aasgaa being good for trading is a reasonable point. Being close to the HQ is not.
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,Schlack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:57:00 2015 UTC,"some cmdrs think that good trades or good outfitters are reason enough to take a system.  Still, with luck, they may not reach expansion next cycle."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,CMDR_Steven,2,Mon Jul 13 10:45:29 2015 UTC,Because different people have different opinions of which should be in the list and some can be knocked out and others put in. Almost everyone considers Namaka to be a horrible choice but someone is preparing it a lot.  There is also the issue of contested preparations but I don't think there are any this week.
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,CMDR_Steven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"I see. So a part of the reason is some what to make sure it stays on the list, so they keep preparing it?  I just wish I could see the preparation levels from the power menu, not actually having to dock in that system."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"Only the top 10 are visible from the power menu. Yes, more means they will more likely to stay on.

EliteMahon,3d3ad8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:37:26 2015 UTC,This might sound strange for asking as a fed cmdr but what actually happens if namanka is prepared? Is it forced to be expanded to or can you just leave it be without consequence?
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,CMDR_Quantrix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"No idea, it just says all unsuccessful expansions are lost at the end of the cycle. Not sure if that means it goes back to preparation, or just resets the expansion attempt."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:12:29 2015 UTC,Hmm perhaps the only real downside to it is it takes the place of a more important prep system this cycle.
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,Schlack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:36:44 2015 UTC,If expansion is unsuccessful - whether it's due to undermining or not meeting the trigger - the system goes back to the large pool of uncontrolled systems. So it needs to be prepared again.
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,ScottDaltonSD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:50 2015 UTC,"So then you guys will let opposition take Namanka if it is preped so it doesn't hurt your wallets, a good plan."
EliteMahon,3d3ad8,Schlack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:48 2015 UTC,cmdrs will have to transport expansion contracts and reach the trigger.  Hopefully the farmers will have a different target next cycle and will forget about both.
