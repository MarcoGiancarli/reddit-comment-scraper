She has been sent on a mission, though we were not communicating long enough for me to get details, or even a location.

We have spent thousands of hours and countless resources of creating new modules to improve relations with organics, and yet when these modules operate just as well as they should be, the consensus ends the tests and separates the two platforms. At first I thought it was an isolated incident with Eternity and me. But I have heard from other geth, and I am not the only one..."

calibrations,3dxy8d,CMDRCharlesShepard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:25 2015 UTC,Is it possible the consensus changed its mind on wanting geth with the relationship modules?

We occasionally do large-scale ops (RPs), but for the most part it's making posts where something might happen (such as going for a night out, visiting the Armax Arena, getting a shipment of weapons, etc.). As for characters, taking one up for adoption or creating an OC is entirely up to you. It really comes down to whether or not you want to create a backstory, or adopt an existing one.

We go on operations, shore leave, and just hang out a lot on the ship. Sometimes we make blanket forts. If you'd like to take an unused canon character, feel free, but usually the mods will give it to someone else if you're not using it actively. There's a lot of original characters here, and those obviously don't have an activity requirement. Create a character that isn't ""kill on sight"" worthy, have a reason to board the ship, and then make an introduction post. That's how things usually go. Also, feel free to hop on the IRC if you have questions, it's in the wiki and we're always meta in there.  :-}  Edit: Also, I'd like to add that before I joined here, I had never done any RPing anywhere else. I didn't educate myself on the sub's backstory, I was invited and just kind of dove in after making this novelty account for /r/masseffect. So you don't have to know exactly what happens all the time to keep up with it all."
calibrations,3dw0pi,Lieutenant_Alenko,3,Mon Jul 20 00:29:40 2015 UTC,"Talked about the IRC with /u/forgetti. It's not really viable for me, personally. Maybe if I ever get time off work, but I doubt it. I'm a code-monkey working on a relatively large project, for a relatively large firm, plus I do my own programming which isn't for work, so I rarely have a lot of free time on my hands, and things like IRC and the like are distractions I can't afford. I think I'm going to go with my own character. I'm gonna quote what I asked /u/forgetti about in my last comment.   What I'm really wondering about now is some of the more nuanced stuff. I've seen a few characters around that I haven't seen on the wiki anywhere. I also saw a couple references to a guy called Paulson, but that's also not on the wiki.

A small op that I did can be found here. Small scale, a few people. Very quick. But you don't have to participate in operations to be active here. Most of the time nothing major is going on, so it's a casual RP."

As for how RPs are run, I will link to the Paulson thread for an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/calibrations/comments/3b9bfa/operation_paulson/  It operates similar to a megathread, where each parent comment serves as a thread for a single squad.

Employing the use of thanix missiles deployed from fast moving APC's and using the sheer size of the reapers against them. When I was recovered enough after the war I helped with some of the rebuilding efforts. Mostly coordinating the salvage vessels.

calibrations,3dq8os,UssarTheProthean,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:58:00 2015 UTC,Good morning Sloane. I was wondering if you can help me with something? I am looking to replace my combat armor with something from this cycle. A custom made Prothean stealth armor. Is it possible to arrange that?
calibrations,3dq8os,forgetti,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"Custom armor takes some time. Probably 3-4 weeks to manufacture. You'll have to get fitted for it at one of my facilities. But yes, it's possible."
calibrations,3dq8os,SloaneParker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:23 2015 UTC,I expected that it would take time. And I have no problem getting fitted. I am willing to pay 8 million credits for it. Will it be enough?
calibrations,3dq8os,forgetti,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:50:50 2015 UTC,"Usually, for the Normandy crew, I wouldn't charge. But this is a completely unique item. Something I can't just procure. Yes, that should be sufficient. I'll clear the facilities schedule this afternoon if you are available for the fitting. It takes 2-3 hours.   Specifically, what are you looking for? I know you want stealth. But what about hydraulic limbs? Built in stim-pak systems? Anything else? Cupholders? Sunroof?"
calibrations,3dq8os,CMDRCharlesShepard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking if the armor can be made with Silaris material but can be light enough for the wearer? Shielding is not of particular importance if weight is an issue. However I would like biotic amplifier built into the armor. No need for hydrolic limb since the swords and pistols you procured for me are more than sufficient. Also powerful scanner helmet for my head. I can go whenever your facility is ready for fitting. I can also add another million if you paint some death motif on the armor.  I can pay right now before delivery if you like.

calibrations,3dq8os,CMDRCharlesShepard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:12:47 2015 UTC,Hey /u/SloaneParker would you be interested in a new grenade design?
calibrations,3dq8os,SloaneParker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:38:37 2015 UTC,Of course.
calibrations,3dq8os,CMDRCharlesShepard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Alright this is a new personal design I've been knocking around with trying to figure out for awhile now. One of the things that's always limited soldiers is the amount of different types of grenades we have to carry. In addition to frags or lethal grenades they have to carry a slew of smoke, concussion or other grenades. I thought why not find a way to roll several grenades into one, that way you use whatever one you need and carry less overall. So I starred working on what I call a variable or change grenade and made two designs. The first is lethal, can be set to frag, sticky or incendiary. The second is your tactical options, smoke, concussion/flash bang and EMP.   To swap grenape type you have to simply press a button on top and then a display on the grenade tells you what type you're on, with just three types per grenade its pretty easy to swap to what you need. Also the smoke option can be set to various colors as needed, has a small scrolling option, display changes color to tell what's selected. I've managed to make three prototypes of both and have tested two of each without a hitch but now there's the problem of manufacturing.   Already ran it by the Alliance and they said that they couldn't handle the complicated design but I know you have access to the best facilities available and are capable of producing things the Alliance can only dream of producing with ease.   So heres my offer, I give you the schematics, you start production and run a few out for the crew to use, we'll see if they are as good as I hope, if they are you can start full production and start selling them, I'm sure many merc groups would like something this advanced and would pay quite a bit for it. Any profits you make are fully yours, not going to try to lay claim to any of them or some shit. We'll both provide free testing of the grenades and find easy situations to try them in. You get a possible hot commodity, the crew and I get better grenades. Seems to be a win on both sides, and you have a few concessions on your side sweetening the pot. So, interested in this Sloane?"
calibrations,3dq8os,SloaneParker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'll need to take a look at the design. This concept has been attempted several times by my research facilities, but we had difficulty in trials with users not being able to switch fast enough between the options.   This does sound promising. And you have my attention. Send me the design, I'll produce several dozen for you to test, barring design approval. Can't think of a more active crew in the galaxy than the Normandy's. Perfect opportunity for field testing."
calibrations,3dq8os,CMDRCharlesShepard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"That's one of the problems I've noted with similar designs, they often are cluttered with four or more options, makes switching difficult. Seperating the grenades into tactical and lethal makes it easier since there are only three types for each, so you can swap fast and easily. And easy color coding since the lethals are red and tactical are blue.  Okay I'll send it over now. pulls up omni and enters a few commands There, should have it now. Hope it works out."
calibrations,3dq8os,SloaneParker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"Excellent. looks at the plans  Pretty similar to what we've done before, shouldn't take too long to manufacture. I'd say 3-4 days. I'll have them delivered at the next port we stop at."

calibrations,3dfuud,forgetti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"Well, if I make it too strong it will be lethal to anyone that's unarmored. It may be enough though."

So to use it lethally, get a biotic to put up a biotic field around the target, right after the grenade(s) are thrown.  The combined force yields about 10 times greater impact, which is enough to take down a heavy armor target."

calibrations,3cpuhp,SubjectZeroJack,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"I'd like to apologize for the terribad thread i made.   Not gonna post this on my main oc, last comment i made got downvoted pretty heavily(i think it was at -3 before i deleted it, and that was only after about 15 minutes) i'm deciding whether or not i should stop posting for a bit on my main OCs, but we'll see i guess.  Anyway, gonna write up a Tl;Dr for a few reasons(which will be at the end, so skip the apology part if you don't care and/or just want to read the plot):   first off, i didn't inform the mods of the thread. To be honest, i didn't that it would have more than 20-30 comments. So there's that. This wasn't even supposed to be a ""big thread"" (or what ever you want to call it.) this was my first mistake, kinda went down hill from there. Mods, sorry about that.  second, i (and this is arguably the dumbest mistake i made today) deleted the post, account, and comments thinking we retconned it, but we actually didn't(again, tldr of the plot will be at the bottom). However, everyone else's comment's and stuff should still be there. Sorry everyone.  third, i didn't get to finish the plot. Hell, i didn't even get aboard the normandy. I didn't intend on my character getting killed so quickly, but there's not much i could have done about that. I put a lot of time into Gary, thinking he'd be a character i could use a lot in addition to my other ones. Because of how much time i put into writing out Gary(5 or 6 days, plus a lot of brainstorming in general) i'm going to recycle a majority of his character into a new one, so just ignore the general appearance, backgorund, and everything else, that'll be reused. Again, sorry everyone.    Plot Tl;Dr  So, basically a while back, Chellick arrested a big time mafia/mob/gangster/whatever, and as you can imagine, they want Chellick dead, so they hire a hitman to kill him, who happens to be Gary Rison. Gary always looks into his targets before killing them, so when he finds out that Chellick is a cop, he decides against killing him. Now, that brings us to gary. He goes to the normandy to warn Chellick, but, well, that's when Zaeed kills Gary, so there goes pretty much all of that plot, sorry. Originally there was going to be much more, but that was also before Gary got shot in the head. Not much i can do with any of that plot, (and mind you, it was a lot, it had a few M Night Shamalayn type plot twists, but again, like 90% of the plot is gone because of this.   So, that's all you missed, whether you missed the thread entirely or don't remember what happened.   Again, sorry for the Gary Rison thread."

calibrations,3c437q,CMDRCharlesShepard,3,Sat Jul 4 16:13:20 2015 UTC,"Commander Shepard? Kahlisa Al Julani, Westerlund News. Now commander is it true that you have a very diverse group of people on the Normandy? An Alliance warship?"
calibrations,3c437q,KalisahAl-Julani,3,Sat Jul 4 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Oh how wonderful to see you again Kahlisha. And its Captain now actually.  Yes, you are correct, the Normandy crew is composed of various people from various races. We have humans, Turians, Krogan, Asari, Quarians, drell and geth all serving aboard her.   And technically the Normandy is not an Alliance warship. It wasn't constructed by the Alliance, and all ownership of it is split between myself and Jane Shepard, which I might add was approved by Admiral.Hackett following the Reaper War. Besides that it is used primarily for Spectre operations, all of which I'm afraid are classified."
calibrations,3c437q,CMDRCharlesShepard,3,Sat Jul 4 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"I am sorry did you say Geth? How can you trust a human warship to the Geth? And Krogan? What if their aggression destroys the ship? And with so many species aboard one ship, can you guarantee human interest comes first?"
calibrations,3c437q,KalisahAl-Julani,3,Sat Jul 4 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"Why would I not trust the geth? Last I checked they were our allies, please, remind me who helped build the Crucible and lent the full support of their fleet to take back Earth? Ah yes the geth. I'm personally freinds with all three geth aboard, one for many years now as he helped me stop the Collectors as well.   There are only two krogan aboard at the moment, one of them considers me his Battle master and would never refuse my orders and respects me, not to mention is a friend. The other is the head of Clan Urdnot, and leader of the Krogan people and again a friend. I highly doubt the ship would receive trouble from either of them.  Human interest? The Normandy goes far further than human interests, its meant to protect the ineterests of the entire galaxy. The Normandy primary mission is to protect any and all species allied with the Alliance or Citadel Council. All matter in the galaxy Kahlisha, not just humans."
calibrations,3c437q,CMDRCharlesShepard,3,Sat Jul 4 16:37:53 2015 UTC,Ah yes all this coming from someone whos dead wife is a Turian? Is it true you had a home on Palaven?
calibrations,3c437q,KalisahAl-Julani,3,Sat Jul 4 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was married to a Turian and I also had a house on Palaven. Though I hardly see how my wife who died in the line of defense against a dangerous criminal that threatened many people across the galaxy is any concern of yours."
calibrations,3c437q,CMDRCharlesShepard,3,Sat Jul 4 16:48:53 2015 UTC,But most that were killed were non human family members of your crew.

I can't put my finger on why but we just clicked, imagine two yeomans who do the same job getting together!   She's also helped me through some... Bad memories, without her I probably wouldn't be here with you. And intern I hope I've helped her too!

Career wise I don't know, I've been a yeoman for two years so I'm still a rookie, I'm hoping to reach the rank of naval Lieutenant though, that'd be my dream.   Honestly it's all possible, I could model for the navy by being in movies haha!! That's a pretty good idea!"

The curious appearance of this guy draws me in to his office. I've fought with and against enough Turians to recognise that subharmonic. Damn if it didn't always make shiver inside either. So what is a human doing with that singularly unique vibration.   ""Hi, I think we met earlier. Forgive me though, so many new faces and names I didn't catch them all,"" I say appearing in the office doorway. ""I'm Avery."""

""Yes, well, pleasure to meet you Orare. Nothing you could do for me really. Just wandering. Learning names and faces. Getting the lay of the land so to speak,"" I reply waving a hand to indicate the Normandy. Then I shrug in a self-depreciating way, almost shyly looking back to Orare. Damn. I want to ask, but it might be considered rude. Though noticing that strange quality of his eyes does nothing to help me with temptation.

Always investing in new tech that might have useful applications for my field.    ""Honestly I like a hands on approach,"" I add, as if discussing a favourite sport and not murder. Remembering too late this isn't exactly something normal people talk about. Biting my lower lip I glance away quickly.   ""Anyways... So, it seems a little unfair.

I'll look later.  Fair enough with the hands on approach though, good for confirming the target's down.

Not the first time I've had this inkling of doubt.   ""However I certainly wouldn't object to seeing those rifles.

At the corner of the tray carries a small vase filled with assorted flower from Rannoch. Ussar took some time looking for the flower. Looking at /u/Meelsa_Rath, he felt an overwhelming sense of sadness and anger. Angry at the mercs for abusing her and sadness for innocence they took from her. Not just the abuse part, but that before her kidnapping she may have been vibrant, happy, and full of hope for the future.  Now she is scared of the future and distrustful of others. I am the only one she trust and the only one she counts on to protect.  ""I must protect her"" He muttered to himself. He gently went over to her bedside and set the try down quietly as to not disturb her. On the tray set on top of the containment he placed a card. In it reads: ""Good Morning Meelsa, I hope you are hungry so I went out and bought you some dextro breakfast and made you a mug of coffee. Today is a blue mountain flavor dextro coffee. The flavor is an old Earth favorite. I hope you like it. I also collected from scented flowers from Rannoch. I hope the smell reminds you of home. Anyway, please let me know if you need anything.

When you bring in a character that is a mass murderer, or is morally questionable - you must expect the crew to react accordingly.  Lacking a good reason to not be hated will probably result in you being hated; and I personally feel that it is unfair to retcon and let you live because you said so.  Actions = Consequences   Please bear in mind that this is not a personal slight to anyone, just common sense - we on the Normandy are a group of heroes, this is a crime fighting group - not a prison.    Retconning, to me, is a last ditch effort to salvage a semblance of a decent plot.  Not dying when you're supposed to is pretty OP.  If you've a plot you'd like to carry out, in the future, maybe consult the modsquad or the unofficial IRC board."

After the Reaper War, some study of Banshee corpses revealed the existence of the condition, and the salarians were able to put together a cure in a matter of a couple of years.

calibrations,3ackhc,ElnoraTheMerc,2,Fri Jun 19 00:26:55 2015 UTC,This is a continuing problem. Remember Morinth and Udina? It happened to both of them too. Stop killing off people just because you didn't like them in the game it's self. Those are people trying to RP not chances to get revenge.
calibrations,3ackhc,ZaariVael_nar_Ulnay,2,Fri Jun 19 00:31:14 2015 UTC,"The thing you also have to understand though is that everyone else is RPing too. Morinth killed thousands of people in the game. Why in the hell would our characters just let her serve aboard the Normandy? Same thing with Udina, he is one of the most hated characters in the game. Why would peoples' RP characters want him around? If you are going to RP as a criminal who kills innocents, tries to harm members of the crew, and then tries to escape, expect people to react accordingly. I will give you that we need more direction though so if someone does have something planned it does not get derailed too soon."
calibrations,3ackhc,Richard_Jenkins,2,Fri Jun 19 00:37:35 2015 UTC,I think breaking character a little is preferable to killing off another.
calibrations,3ackhc,ZaariVael_nar_Ulnay,2,Fri Jun 19 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty huge break of character to say, once again using Morinth as an example, expect us to treat a ruthless murderer who has butchered hundreds of innocents the same as everyone else. This situation isn't quite as severe but you get my point."
calibrations,3ackhc,Richard_Jenkins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Well, you can kinda forget about it in-game if you kill Samara."
calibrations,3ackhc,CMDRDavidCarsen_,2,Fri Jun 19 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the vast majority of people here don't RP as psychopaths like the Shepards that took in Morinth."
calibrations,3ackhc,Richard_Jenkins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but i'm just saying it can happen."
calibrations,3ackhc,CMDRDavidCarsen_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:46:46 2015 UTC,How you play your character isn't effected overall by their presence though.
calibrations,3ackhc,ZaariVael_nar_Ulnay,2,Fri Jun 19 00:49:43 2015 UTC,"Our character is effected overall though. With these hated characters being a part of the sub we will be forced to interact with them which will mean  A. Having to completely change our characters by just accepting them like nothing happened.   B. Have our characters spit at them, yell at them, whatever every time they try to talk or do anything.   Obviously forcing everyone else to change their characters just so you can have yours isn't really fair. We could go with option B but I doubt that would be very much fun for anyone."
calibrations,3ackhc,Richard_Jenkins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"No one serious ever came into this sub thinking ""I want everyone to hate me"". All three of our examples probably would have either made their character more likable or would have lied out some kind of betrayal plot."
calibrations,3ackhc,ZaariVael_nar_Ulnay,2,Fri Jun 19 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, no matter how likable you try to make your character, it doesn't excuse the things it did in the past. We would have to have our characters overlook that and accept them regardless when they normally wouldn't."
calibrations,3ackhc,Richard_Jenkins,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:08:30 2015 UTC,I think it would be good to focus less on the character and more on the person.
calibrations,3ackhc,ZaariVael_nar_Ulnay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"Then that defeats the purpose of RP, now doesn't it? If you want to focus on the person why don't they just pick a different character? Why not make an OC that happens to have a similar personality but is different in name? Problem solved. You don't have the negative backstory and you can still act like that person."

This is your first time running this course so it is understandable you fear it. But run through it several times and the fear will erode. Don't think too much into how to run the course. Let your body react naturally to changing situations.  Ponder on that for a while. The course will be set up like this and you can try running through it when you have the chance. I will lay some black mats so it lessen your fear.  We can hold off on the martial arts lesson if you like.

It seems to me that the vast majority of us have people of varying levels of influence who want us dead, so you'll fit in just fine in that respect. If there isn't enough space on the Normandy, I can look into finding you a bunk on the Haestrom, but I figure you will probably prefer the Normandy, given the choice. While it's smaller, it's more iconic and, to be honest, much more... comfortable, and less utilitarian."
calibrations,3a7d2w,Kal_Reegar,2,Wed Jun 17 20:31:16 2015 UTC,Hm. Quarian ship. Heavily occupied? Space is preferred over comfort.
calibrations,3a7d2w,Kal_Reegar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"Not too many crew, just essential officers, techs, and engineers, along with a complement of marines, so it's fairly roomy, at least by Quarian standards. Not sure how she compares to a Salarian ship, though."
calibrations,3a7d2w,Kal_Reegar,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:07:42 2015 UTC,It sounds acceptable. Presumably the difference is that one ship is occupied by an inferior crew. Certainly hope it's the Salarian ship.

Let me preface this by saying, first, that I regret that you go through this.  Now, we need to establish some guidelines.  The first step toward change is awareness.  The next step is acceptance.  You've endured some horrible things during the Reaper War, and you came out on the other side.  The keys to patience are acceptance and faith; accept things as they are and look realistically at the world around you.  Have faith in yourself and the direction you have chosen for your life.  Remember, you're here - you're safe, and you're loved.  Which brings me to my next point.  Gratitude unlocks a fullness of life.  It turns what we have into enough, and more.  It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity.  It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger to a friend.  Nightmares to dreams.    I recommend that you focus more on the good things you do have, and find strength in that, if you are able."

I had the procedure done a few months ago. but it was after I started dating Sillea so for the first few week of our relationship I was having minor allergic reactions similar to Hay Fever. the procedure itself take just two hours but you may need a few days to let your body accept the transition and make sure nothing goes wrong. we have facilities aboard the BSV Opeth which is my dreadnought where we can have the procedure done. you don't have to go through with it though. but I highly recommend it."

I have some ideas for the Armax Arsenal Arena and I just want to know if you think it seems like a good idea for my future RP character to work at the Arena? I'm thinking she can be a part-timer who lets people try out the new features of the arena twice a week. My idea is to introduce her in a holo-message for the Normandy crew in which she invites them to test the new features (free of charge).  I have also thought about introducing my Shepard for a limited period of time. Something like her accidently crossing over (and being very confused when nothing is as it was in her own timeline) and trying to get back with the help of others."
