truecreepy,3dk278,Bloodcloud,22,Thu Jul 16 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, if I heard some desperate knocks coming from a room somebody told me to stay the fuck away from (and only approached with a weapon) I'd assume somebody was held captive.  I'd call the cops, I wouldn't post on reddit - that doesn't sound creepy, that sounds like human trafficking."
truecreepy,3dk278,EmoryM,8,Fri Jul 17 01:05:19 2015 UTC,"Shit now your sketching me out.. I'm not going to give away the car dealership I work for, but it isn't a shitty pre owned lot. It's a big name brand so I'm hesitant to think they would be keeping someone. Wouldn't they have cried or or something? I don't want to go back up there tomorrow. I don't even know if it's still unlocked"
truecreepy,3dk278,hairlessmilk,3,Fri Jul 17 01:12:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my first thought as well... I would think they could still make some distressed vocal sounds even if their mouth was taped shut (assuming it was someone being held captive).  What else could it be though? An animal would probably make even more noise."
truecreepy,3dk278,EmoryM,2,Fri Jul 17 01:16:47 2015 UTC,Now that the idea is out there... the room is next to the power room. If you did watch the video it does make a decent amount of noise. It could muffle sounds from far away but not from being right up against it. When I booked it out of there I heard the last couple pounds when I was already down the hallway so I could have missed some sort of verbal communication
truecreepy,3dk278,bfleming113,2,Fri Jul 17 01:20:15 2015 UTC,"Something like 8 out of 10,000 are mute - maybe your GM found the perfect prisoner! =]  ...and an abandoned room in an abandoned area of a car dealership?  Who would look for a missing person there?"
truecreepy,3dk278,xxstarryxeyedxx,10,Fri Jul 17 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"Okay so first off I believe your story as written. But my skeptic side points out that when you walked into the big room where the power room and ""locked"" door with banging sound, you turned on the lights for about a second and then turned them back off. Then after 3 seconds you turned them back on. That could have been a signal to whoever was behind the door or it could have spooked whoever was in there. I am not saying which one I think it is, but thought I would simply point this out. The knife that the GM requested could have been to pry open the breaker box as they sometimes are hard to open. And finally thank you for explaining the events, posting the video, and then sticking with the thread to defend your story. My opinion on your next course of action would be to try the room again, maybe next week, and see if the banging occurs again. Good luck and remember to film it for us."
truecreepy,3dk278,mrsj74,3,Fri Jul 17 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for not being a butthole dude. I appreciate the honesty and the for the tip. As for the lights, there were 3 switches for that room, I turn on the one, then off and hit a different one to see what would happen. I think the lights changed but I honestly can't tell. And yeah who knows what the knife is for. I remember my dad showing me when I was little how to get one of those bad boys open with a knife.  I think I'm going to check to see if that whole area is open tomorrow and go from there. If it's unlocked I don't think I could help myself at this point to see whats going on"
truecreepy,3dk278,mrsj74,3,Fri Jul 17 05:30:49 2015 UTC,I watched it twice and it does appear to be different lights. :)
truecreepy,3dk278,sparrow5,7,Fri Jul 17 08:28:37 2015 UTC,"This whole thing is so weird. I can't imagine what else could be up there besides a human being. The sounds at the end kind of sounded like someone jiggling the same kind of door knob that you checked earlier.  I'm impressed that you even ventured back there because even without the noises, that whole area seems extra creepy. I hope you get some answers & update soon."
truecreepy,3dk278,Doom_Phd,3,Fri Jul 17 10:24:23 2015 UTC,"When you have been there that long and that whole area is finally open.. I couldn't pass it up even if I was hearing sounds. After reading everyone's comments and watching the video again a couple times I'm leaving towards a human too. This is to weird for it to be something paranormal. The only thing that really bugs me, is that I didn't hear any sort of verbal communication what so ever"
truecreepy,3dk278,Cthulia,2,Fri Jul 17 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that not hearing anything verbal is weird, but in a situation this bizarre...Having said that, my next thought if there is a person in there, is why? And what about the whole loss of power & the strange behavior of your GM? I know you didn't mention it to any of the other sales people, but have any of them ever said anything about the upstairs?"
truecreepy,3dk278,raiseurT,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:42 2015 UTC,No one has said anything about up there before. It has been 'unused' so we never thought twice about it. It has always just been a creepier area of the dealership
truecreepy,3dk278,jeepdave,5,Fri Jul 17 15:07:09 2015 UTC,I'm sort of afraid to watch the video but I'm thinking you could contact your police department and ask about making an anonymous report about your workplace because you don't want to lose your job. I don't know what the protocol is but it might be worth a call just to ask. Sounds sketchy anyway.
truecreepy,3dk278,mrsj74,2,Fri Jul 17 05:24:05 2015 UTC,Don't be afraid to watch my friend. It doesn't even come close to some of the stuff thats on this page. Going to the police right now seems really drastic. There are way to many possibilities for what's behind the door and going to the to cops right now seems like a waste of time and will lead to an awkward situation if it's nothing. I'm going to ask my GM tomorrow about upstairs and just observe more of how he answers it then what he actually says. I'm going to go from there.
truecreepy,3dk278,SpookyMcPants,5,Fri Jul 17 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"If you can get back there again, you should try knocking on the door or sticking something under it if you can. Try to establish communication."
truecreepy,3dk278,Wabbithunter68,3,Fri Jul 17 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"Unfounded theory: your boss is holding someone prisoner, and they caused the power to go out as an attempt to signal for help/get someone to find them."
truecreepy,3dk278,Wabbithunter68,2,Fri Jul 17 22:12:51 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too.
truecreepy,3dk278,Wabbithunter68,2,Fri Jul 17 23:43:05 2015 UTC,First I seriously doubt it's anything illegal. Why? Because it makes no sense to traffic humans or keep people locked up against thier will on the same floor where your employees eat lunch. I have worked at a dealership before. None of is sales piss ons were allowed upstairs at all. That's was the higher ups area and it was layed out fairly similar to what is in the video. No call cubicles though. There is information that MUST be kept behind locked doors. Lots of customer info and company info in that building. The knife sounds like any other breaker box I've dealt with. Makes em easier to pop open. The arrogant GM? Swing a cat in the car business. That's as normal as rain on a summer evening.   No I believe this is a legit post and legit video. I think there could be other things at play. There could be a mechanical room for the HVAC and other building equipment in that room. Makes sense because of the electrical room right next door. And HVAC equipment can make lots of WTF noises. Banging. Thuds. Thrashing. Any of that is possible.   My belief is the building is just being a building. It can be creepy but I doubt there is more than that going on.
truecreepy,3dk278,SpookyMcPants,2,Fri Jul 17 20:50:09 2015 UTC,Your GM sounds like a narcissistic douche. Not at all creepy I guess (sigh) Well damn..guess the mystery may never be solved. Kudos OP for following up & posting something that appears 100% legit. That upstairs area is still creepy as hell though :)
truecreepy,3dk278,SpookyMcPants,3,Fri Jul 17 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'll bite and say this is true. Understand a few things.    Does your job allow you to deny someone who MAY be injured, held captive, or even being ransomed their freedom and safety? No, it doesn't. You are a salesman. You are able to find work lots of places. Going to the police IS step 1. Hell, even an anonymous tip is better than nothing in this case. The door handle doesn't jiggle. If someone is in there, they're not fully free. The hands must be bound at the wrists, and likely behind the back. Why? If you were not bound, simply held in a room with no means to escape, you'd be trying that door handle constantly. It doesn't jiggle. If a human is behind that door, they ARE in dire need of help. Fuck your job. Honestly? I'm stunned at the level of cowardice you show about this. For fucks sake, go to a pay phone, ring it in as a tip from a curious person, state the huge importance, and hang up. No worrying about the loss of your job, will prepare you for the horrid guilt you will be hit with if this comes out as someone sold into sex slavery, someone being held against their will and murdered, or any number of scenario's like this. Do the right damn thing here. Call it in, at the very least. If it's nothing? Then you sleep better at night knowing you did SOMETHING tangible, rather than hide behind excuses. Don't be that person. Do something."
truecreepy,3dk278,SpookyMcPants,6,Fri Jul 17 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Am I being cowardly about this at the moment? Of course. This is something no person should have to experience. You can read and watch videos on this page to your hearts content and get chills. That's it. Let me tell you, finally being on the other side of things is totally different. This isn't something ANYONE should have to go through. Yes there are many actions I could have taken that day but I will tell you without a doubt I was fucking scared. I still am fucking scared. I have never ever had anything even remotely close to this happen to me and I'm probably still in a state of panic. I'm not even going to waste my time replying  anymore to someone who comes off that aggressive that quick."
truecreepy,3dk278,real-again,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to think that if there is anything illegal going on, and to be honest there isn't much proof it's happening, then I'd be leaning towards it being something like drugs, fraud or money laundering. Hiding unwilling people in a building where noise can carry and the possibility of escape seems risky.  What stood out for me was how clean the place was for somewhere that hadn't been used in a number of years. So at least it's being cleaned on a regular basis."
truecreepy,3dk278,Honeychile6841,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too. As well in the conference room, there are still nice leather chairs and a giant table just... sitting there. And I'm really surprised no one has spoken up about the bathroom light being on because I don't have a god damn clue on what that is about"
truecreepy,3dk278,jvene1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:50 2015 UTC,It would seem as if it's being used on a regular basis otherwise what's the point of it being kept clean. Cleaning costs money so why fork out for something that isn't being utilised?
truecreepy,3dk278,real-again,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:58:39 2015 UTC,That's a really good question and observation. I'm surprised I didn't even notice that. I don't even know what to tell you dude. The only thing I can think of is that it is still being used.. off hours maybe?
truecreepy,3dk278,stealthymountain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:13:52 2015 UTC,It's all very strange.
truecreepy,3dk278,jvene1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:36 2015 UTC,"That is of course, the right you have here. I don't mean it as hostile. I mean it if anything, as perhaps a take on the need for folks to stop being bystanders to the shitty things people do to one another.  I get that you are both frightened, and in a state of shock. Hell, if you like man, PM me privately. You can vent, I'll listen. I'll gladly try to help you through the shock.  What I'm saying is, please, please do not become apathetic to this situation. As I said, to make an anonymous tip would still let you keep your job, wouldn't tip off ANYONE to whom made the tip, and basically, cover your rear while perhaps saving a life. Please, do consider it."
truecreepy,3dk278,raiseurT,3,Fri Jul 17 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"Alright so here are my thoughts on the current situation. At this very moment, there are to many things that are up in the air. It could simply be another generator making noise. Due to no one really knowing anything about up there is a bit concerning. And as /u/wabbithunter68 has said, it is very clean for being ""unused"". There are still chairs, a table, a bathroom with the light on and a fresh thing of paper towel in the dispenser. Now, I'm starting to think that area does in fact get used. It must be for after hours cause no one goes up there during the day. That being the case, whatever or whoever is beyond that door may possibly play into the fact that the area might be used after hours. This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to post an update on the story, describing my general manager. Maybe we can narrow down some options based on him because he is.... interesting. After I post the update, I will track him down if he isn't busy and simply ask why we don't use the upstairs area at all seeing that it's huge. I am going to observe how he answers. From there I am going to check the door again. If it is unlocked I will turn my camera back on ans post another video. This has got more attention then I thought and I can't back away from another opportunity to snoop. If its locked, I will make a second update about what my GM said, then wait for further discussion from the community to decide what to do next. More so leaning towards making an call to the cops"

If they are holding someone there are doing dodgy things then waiting a week will probably mean whoever is behind it all will move whatever they are hiding. Act now before it is too late.   It might not be human trafficking but it could easily be something f else illegal.

It seems that he  has a support network if something is going on with him.  No need to inject yourself into his situation, but also no need to make the situation worse.  Maybe even mention it to his wife."
truecreepy,3d9it6,tawnirux,3,Tue Jul 14 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"What about this in an email?........... ""I converted the video to MP3 for sound editing. I found a very faint conversation at 51:03 minutes and cut the first 50 minutes of the clip as there was no audible conversation for that time, even with the volume all the way up. I compressed and de-noised the audio as much as I could. Unfortunately, the conversation is tied up with the static. When I de-noised to 0 dB, all the sound went away. The same at 50dB. The filters just simply cannot detach the conversation from the static, and most of it is inaudible. I tried passing the clip through a plug-in that is specialized for static, and even after tweaking all the settings, I couldn’t do better than this. But here is the audio. I amplified it but of course the static is amplified too.....A networking/IT worker will definitely be able to tell you if any of your electronics are bugged. That would be a better route to go, as it seems that there is nothing concrete on this sound clip. Best wishes,"""

I wouldn't want to talk too technical to him either because you don't want to validate him too much and he won't understand most of what you're saying anyway. I also would have this conversation casually in person. Doing so will allow you to control when to exit the conversation for good, and stop him if he tries to get argumentative.   Also, the wife thing is rather worrisome and may indicate that more is going on here with his mental health. It might be worth mentioning to her."

Right after the start, Ił-62M SP-LBG ""Tadeusz Kościuszko"" airplane with 183 people inside flying above town called Warlubie got caught in emergency. Two engines we're damaged. The cause was twisted turbine shaft in one of the engines. The crew of the flight felt that pressure in the cabine was low, so after turning back to airport they lowered to 4000 meters.   Because of lackness of steer control of the airplane, pilots needed to use only trimmer device. The crew considered also landing in Modlin airport, but eventually ended up in wanting to land in Okęcie.   2 minutes before the catastrophe the crew lost control of the machine. After all airplane crashed 5 kilometers from lane 33 of Warsaw's Okęcie.  Nobody survived.  Pilots fought to the end trying to safely land the plane. Last words that are able to hear directed to steer control in Warsaw became the symbol of the tragedy:  ""Goodbye, goodnight! Bye, we're dying!""

The first set is comprised of natural numbers, all below ten. The second set is natural numbers only as well, but goes up to 449.  According to this website, 449 is the number of pretty much death, though the author put it more nicely. 449 is also a prime number.   Numbers 1, 2, and 3 appear twice in the first set. Only the number 4 is repeated in the second set. The two sets only have 1, 4, and 9 in common."

truecreepy,33nn6j,mee412,3,Fri Apr 24 04:29:58 2015 UTC,I don't understand put of skin. Care to share?
truecreepy,33nn6j,Krossfireo,3,Fri Apr 24 08:20:11 2015 UTC,"So these are all kinda out there horror, the author has deliberately made what's happening obscure (which I really like in horror), but there's a hole in this woman's yard that is full of dead girls, the woman buries them, and a tree grows from their grave, but it's made of skin and flesh and hands. The ghosts of the girls then start haunting her and she lets them in by accident. Her house looks like it's then made of all their skin and mouths and hands. A trader comes and visits her, and she thinks he killed the girls initially. When she mentions this, the guy goes pale and starts to leave, but the forest (made of skin and hands) kills him. She says that she would then always see his face in all the skin in her house. My interpretation of this is that she killed all the girls and also the trader when he tried to leave"
truecreepy,33nn6j,Tal9922,10,Fri Apr 24 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"No. It was the trader who killed the girls. The woman realizes this right at the start: At the first page she theorizes who could have done this, since no one visits these parts, then we see a  man in a flash of red, who we will later learn is the trader who passes there and has an affair with her (page six). She realizes this and covers for him. The tree and her house transforming is her guilty subconscious. When she confronts the killer, her lover, he leaves, and with him, her guilt."

truecreepy,33nn6j,xannmax,14,Sat Apr 25 00:45:26 2015 UTC,Explain this to me.  What happened here exactly?
truecreepy,33nn6j,oldmoneey,16,Fri Apr 24 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"The brothers went out to kill the beast, one who no one took seriously and one who everyone admired. Upon encountering ""the beast"" mediocre brother hides, and older brother ""slays it"". Then the younger brother kills him so that he can come back with a story that inspires respect among those townspeople. But then the brother returns, obviously not the one he killed, as his coat was in tact. And whatever it was, something wasn't right with it, as it never turned to look at his younger brother and was randomly digging homes at night. Holes like the one they found in the woods.  So young bro goes to check on the body of the brother he tried to kill, and that body turns to look at him.  Just a twist, not sure if it's supposed to make sense. May be deliberately confusing."
truecreepy,33nn6j,xannmax,4,Fri Apr 24 07:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is all that I gathered from the tale.  Perhaps it was intended to be just a spooky, creepy kinda situation someone was put through."
truecreepy,33nn6j,Eal12333,7,Fri Apr 24 07:49:48 2015 UTC,"yeah i don't know either, while i was reading it my mind jumped to a few different ideas. maybe the monster was a shape shifter, and, when his brother got lost the monster disguised himself as the brother to trick him (so he actually did kill the monster). then i thought maybe the monster took his brothers skin after he was killed and pretended to be him, but i don't think that actually makes sense... maybe the main character is just crazy."
truecreepy,33nn6j,hannaguist,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"there were claims of a beast eating livestock so the brothers went out to kill it only for the living brother to realize that the other brother was the beast, so he tried to kill it, but he came back as if nothing happened."
truecreepy,33nn6j,oldmoneey,15,Fri Apr 24 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"No, he killed his brother with the intention of killing his brother. To nab the glory, for once. That's why he was so unsettled by his return, as it seemed to be the monster who came, in disguise as his brother."
truecreepy,33nn6j,Aceofspades25,8,Fri Apr 24 06:59:00 2015 UTC,"A good theory, except at the end of the comic he climbed down the hole to find the body of the brother he killed"
truecreepy,33nn6j,hannaguist,8,Fri Apr 24 04:55:24 2015 UTC,"I thought he killed his brother out of jealousy over his good looks, beautiful wife, bravery, people trusting and liking him and general success as when they compare their two homes, his is much nicer. Most importantly though, the brother was the one who killed the wolf and the killer brother was upset at how he would receive the glory and the killer brother would be mocked for cowardice, hence the parentheses used at that time in the story. Aside from that many aspects of the story afterward are left open to interpretation like, in my opinion, much of good horror."

truecreepy,33nsj5,BerserkRonin,6,Fri Apr 24 01:03:58 2015 UTC,I second the midnight man.
truecreepy,33nsj5,katf1sh,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:21:18 2015 UTC,What's the midnight man?
truecreepy,33nsj5,BerserkRonin,6,Sat Apr 25 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"IIRC you do some ritual like blood/name on a piece of paper and hang it to your door and this invites the midnight man into your home and your goal is to not get caught until the morning.  I think it starts at 3AM (spooky!!) and ends at sunrise or when you end it with a ritual.   I'm pretty sure it's the one where you walk around your home with a candle and if it gets blown out that's the midnight man comin' to get ya and you have like 5 seconds to relight it, if you can't relight it make a circle of salt around you with the little salt pouch you're supposed to bring, and you cannot leave that salt circle for the whole night once you make it.  Now I could be wrong and that's a different game but I'm pretty sure it's that one. So essentially you're walking around the dark in your home at night with a candle avoiding a spirit you called, with a candle to make it extra spooky, and if you fuck up you're sitting in a circle of salt until morning thinking the spirit is watching you.  I'm sure if you type midnight man on google it'll come up. Too lazy tbh haha."

truecreepy,33nsj5,JennyUE,5,Sun May 24 07:31:46 2015 UTC,"You've been desensitized. It depends on what types of scares thrill you.  Could try playing some exceptionally scary video games. Amnesia, Evil Within, and there are lots of other games I'm probably not thinking of."

truecreepy,33nsj5,JennyUE,3,Fri Apr 24 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"It just depends on what you're interested in. And in your defense about Silent Hill, that game mostly gives you nothing to go on - you're just thrown into the world and have to figure it out for yourself. You could try Five Nights at Freddies (PC) but it's more of  a jumpy kind of game, and not so immersive. It's the immersive video games that will give you the good scares. You could try the original Resident Evil (it has been remade for Xbox 360 not sure about PS though, and is available on XBL), you could try Amnesia: the Dark Descent (for PC), Evil Within (all platforms, heard it's a hard game though), F.E.A.R. (360, it's a FPS trilogy), Dead Space (PS3/360, trilogy, #3 sucks unless playing Coop), Call of Cthulhu (classic, original xbox), and The Suffering (original Xbox, FPS, 3 or 4 games). There are other scary games for PC, but they are old classics and normally only be bought through GOG or pirated with emulators (Clock Tower, Alone in the Dark, Dementium, anything by Clive Barker, and some other psychological horrors like I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream (point-and-click, classic, personal favorite). This was a big list but I don't know your preferences so... meh. I put in bold the games for people who ""aren't very good at video games"", which are mostly the older games. If you want me to be more specific, feel free to ask."

I found I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream on there, and I'm thinking about downloading it. I've never played a game on my laptop before. Hopefully the old gal can handle it.  I might actually prefer to play a co-op game to a single-player one, so do you think Dead Space 3 would be a fun one to try?"
truecreepy,33nsj5,JennyUE,2,Mon Apr 27 16:00:35 2015 UTC,Your setup can easily handle I have no mouth and I must scream.  That game is so old lol I think from the 80s.   Dead space 3 would be good to try but it's not as horror esque as the first two. they deviated away from the horror a lot in that game.

truecreepy,33hb3m,Eugeniks_,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:06:29 2015 UTC,"Numbers station:       A numbers station is a type of shortwave radio station characterized by unusual broadcasts, reading out lists of numbers or incomprehensible morse code messages.  The voices are often created by speech synthesis and are transmitted in a wide variety of languages. The voices are usually female, although sometimes men's or children's voices are used. Some voices are synthesized and created by machines; however, some stations used to have live readers.   In the 1960s, Time magazine reported [citation needed] that the numbers stations first appeared shortly after World War II and were imitating a format that had been used to send weather data during that war. It is widely assumed that these broadcasts transmit covert messages to spies. The Czech Ministry of Interior and the Swedish Security Service have both acknowledged the use of numbers stations by Czechoslovakia for espionage,    with declassified documents proving the same. With a few exceptions,  no QSL responses have been received from numbers stations by shortwave listeners who sent reception reports to said stations, which is the expected behavior of a non-clandestine station.   The best known of the numbers stations was the ""Lincolnshire Poacher"", which is thought to have been run by the British Secret Intelligence Service.

These disorders are characterized by social deficits and communication difficulties, stereotyped or repetitive behaviors and interests, sensory issues, and in some cases, cognitive delays.

Couple that with being schizo and I'm convinced she accidentally killed herself in a fit of paranoia. Here's her autopsy report, showing the tox results, etc: http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview-el-autopsy-22  According to her sister, she was on: Wellbutrin an antidepressant used to treat a variety of conditions including depression and other mental/mood disorders.   Lamotrigine, used to help prevent the extreme mood swings of bipolar disorder in adults.   Quetiapine, used to treat certain mental/mood conditions (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, sudden episodes of mania or depression associated with bipolar disorder). Quetiapine is known as an anti-psychotic drug (atypical type). Note: This medication can decrease hallucinations and improve your concentration.

There are almost three thousand entries, though I personally like the first thousand the most, probably due to nostalgia and rose-tinted glasses honestly.  Pages are full of redacted information and blacked out lines to make it appear as if you're actually reading files from some sort of secretive black-ops organization. Reads very technically too, which is sometimes off-putting but really sets the atmosphere."

truecreepy,2qz7sy,dogattorney,2,Fri Mar 13 21:53:32 2015 UTC,"Dude, you have no idea.  One night, after returning from a long road trip from Central Idaho to the Coast of Oregon, I arrived home after many hours of driving. I entered my house and crashed on my bed immediately. I was in such an extreme state of tiredness that I actually couldn't fall asleep because I had been trying so hard to stay awake behind the wheel that I got stuck that way.   So I did what anyone else would do; I watched adult swim for about 2 hours until I did finally fall asleep. All was fine until I was woken abruptly at about 2:30 in the morning to very loud, somewhat creepy, and extrordenary 'trippy' electronica kind of music. I looked upon the television screen to see an even tripper and substantially creepier CGI Salamander-type monstrosity dancing to the beat of the music. I was still in that half asleep dream-like state so time felt like it wasn't passing correctly, and it felt like the hellbeast was in the room with me, trying to get me to join it in it's psychotic dance. I couldn't move, I couldn't scream, I could only stare at the abomination facing me and frantically wonder the fate I would have to endure at Beelzebub's clutches.  And with that, the screen went black. The bold, white letters ""[adult swim]"" appeared, faintly lighting up the room momentarily before an advertisement for a new Honda took it's place. I sat straight up, now more fully awake then ever, and muttered profanities directed towards Adult Swim's production team.  TL;DR: Fuck Adult Swim's awesome faux-advert things."

The circumstances surrounding his death have been disputed since they found his body, there are doubts that what the New Hampshire police decided happened actually happened.  The police maintained that the body had been where it was found for four or five days, HOWEVER, the body was in perfect condition, no animals had bothered with it nor was there any insect activity after all those days.  They said that he died of exposure, however he was stretched out when they found him and not in a fetal position under leaves as if he had been trying to keep warm like most hypothermia victims are found.  It all just seemed very unlikely and I hope that for the sake of closure for Patric's parents they are able to someday find out what REALLY happened to the poor kid.  No 10 year old should die, but especially not alone in the woods.  My heart goes out to his parents."

truecreepy,2ihc5w,AVeryStrongMug,3,Tue Oct 7 16:54:04 2014 UTC,"Are you the creator? The acting fell flat I think because the actors were trying to act, not have a conversation as you would in real life. You could hear the rehearsed cadence and little to no pausing between lines.   You did a good job with the sets on a low budget, but the filters ruined it in my opinion. There's nothing wrong with attaching a visual 'feeling' to your movie, but this was just way too intense.   Also, the stationary camera made it look like the entire film was shot in a tiny room. I'm sure it's tough to add hallways and long shots into something like this. Buy plywood is cheap and endlessly reusable. Invest in a bunch and you can build hallways and bigger sets outdoors without being constrained by the buildings you are using.   One last thing, the plot was really muddy. It wasn't really clear what happened when the bearded guy found his dead friend with the bloody knife; did he stab himself? It sure looked like he did. There were a lot of other confusing moments but I'm rambling now.   I feel like with some tuning your next project could be really good. Thanks for sharing."

This guy is a weird dude. He would always bring up odd shit at random times and by odd I mean either (in terms of subject matter) having to do with violence (""hey that can be used to kill someone like this...""), sexual (""you ever just look at some girls and think that they were just made for sex? Like that chick would make just a perfect little fuck doll if I got my hands on her!"") or both (""It's the really fucked up ones that you gotta hope you don't encounter, like the kind of guy who's trying to rape you and you punch him as hard as you can and bloody up or break his nose…only for him to love it and end up turning him on more!"") and that was all juxtaposed with this sorta happy go lucky nice guy façade.  Of course this is all alarming talk and not something that he blurts out all at once but gradually over time…a good 2 or 3 year period. Then we start learning more about him that's a little off putting like he uses an alias and is involved in a few different questionable ""occupations"" and such. Nothing TOO odd about those, as far as we knew at least.  Well, one night out of no where he just starts talking about ""hey, you remember the east area rapist? Strange how they never caught that guy, huh?"" and all this stuff.  Most of us didn't really give it much thought. To us it was just dude being his normal weirdo self and talking about the usual weirdo shit. But one of our friends was really disturbed by that and we just had to look further into it.  So we do and we're reading up on everything we can about the E.A.R. and it starts to add up and by then we were all disturbed by it. Now we are going through the details…same age as the suspect would've been, lived in the area where a majority of crimes took place, same height, weight and build- physical attributes, this guy is in rather good shape for his age and extremely agile so he could've easily out maneuvered law enforcement on his tail while fleeing the scenes. Yeah, okay that's all adding up and whatever but maybe it's just coincidence? Of course! Crazy talk, right? But then we happened to watch this video and listened to the voice and it's the EXACT SAME CREEPY VOICE that he used to make when he got pissed off and would rant about something all loudly before bring down the volume into this creepy fucking whispery voice!

Before I knew it, every direction I looked, gears were closing in on me until there was nothing but gears and the noise.  The feeling it gave me was a deep sense of impending death. I would wake up in a cold sweat, I even woke up screaming a couple times. I was about 6 when these dreams started, and I was about 20 the last time I had one. I still don't really know what to make of it."
truecreepy,2h10sr,Ysmeertheviking,1 point,Fri Oct 3 22:30:40 2014 UTC,"If you're interested, Carl Jung dedicated a significant part of his career exploring humanity's relation to symbols (I read his work, ""Man and His Symbols"", in college a couple years ago and enjoyed it).  The basic premise is that our unconscious is expressing itself most clearly during our dream states, when our consciousness quiets down and we don't have all the external stimuli.  Maybe there is something in your mind that you are running away from.  Maybe you're denying a part of your awareness and it is trying to make itself known.  I suggest, like someone else in the comments, that you try to accept whatever it is that's coming your way in the dream.  Explore the thing, I think it's your mind trying to show you something ;).  Also, www.dreammoods.com kicks ass.  You search keywords like ""white"", ""peace"", ""scream"", (whatever else you can glean from your dream), and it will give you really interesting interpretations for these symbols."

truecreepy,2h10sr,Berjj,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:23:50 2015 UTC,"Woah, i've been trying to find an answer to this for so long, but so far, still unsolved. I used to have regular night terrors when i was a kid and nowadays, i rarely get them but i'm starting to sleepwalk/talk now. These night terrors always have the same theme. It's always me facing something so IMPOSSIBLY big, too huge, too massive to even be on Earth and i get extremely overwhelmed and crushing fear and when i wake up, it takes so long for the feeling to go away. That 'something' varies, sometimes its my father, sometimes its numbers and sometimes a random giant.  I'm concerned now because images of these 'dreams' are starting to appear when i'm taking short naps or sometimes even when i rest my eyes for a while. And the debilitating fear is there again. Does this have something to do with my panic disorder lol? But right now, i'm pretty healthy mentally and physically.  Fuuuu, like why?!"

The child part sounds like complete bullshit. Is her ONE YEAR OLD really able to communicate that well? Not to mention it's a friggen kid. They do weird shit. The author adding ""or something"" garnered a huge eye roll from me. And lastly, hearing crying. Pipes? The sound of water echoing? I know my shower sometimes does a sort of high pitched moaning noise. GEE FUCKING WHIZ MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED!  I mean, she supposedly had events happening to her and these were the best three she or the writer could come up with?  Also note the fairly vague timeline and reporting of how the woman found out about the murders.   After the bizarre events reportedly continued, she said a neighbor dropped a bombshell on her: the home was previously owned by a couple named Josh and Susan Powell.   Did she tell this neighbor about her experiences? Did they neighbor just randomly tell her? How did all that go down? This is a pretty important part of judging this woman's story.  The article seemed to focus far more on the past crime than what the actual woman experienced. What the woman experienced was so glossed over I have a hard time believing any of it. Maybe she learned of the murders and just wants out because it creeps her out. Cue media attention with a bogus story."

In terms of paranormal phenomenon, her experiences are both very mild and easily explainable.  As for her one year old, I'm skeptical. My nephew just turned two and even he hasn't started forming sentences. He is able to say words just fine, but not sentences. So either her child is developing much quicker than other children, or she's full of shit.  This honestly seems really fishy to me. I would be willing to say that she is taking advantage of an old tragedy and thrusting both her and her home into the spotlight. I would even bet that she is doing this for monetary gain.  Is it crazy to say that she is creating a hoax in order to sell her house for more money? We all know hauntings bring tourists and and attraction. Who wouldn't want to live in a notoriously haunted house with a dark past?  To me, it's just another person playing the game and reaping the rewards. The Warrens were experts at this."

You can also go to the park on Greenlawn Ave, Berliner Park :-) the bike path is rumored to be haunted and also the bridge that the bike path leads to is rumored to be haunted. I myself and my sister have heard things and took some crazy pics there. There have been several drownings under and close to the bridge. Also... I want to mention... please don't go to the park alone especially the bike path. Not saying this because the rumored haunting but because of the type of people that sometimes are at the bridge. Also at one point in time there was a man kidnapping and raping girls and women. Nothing ever happened with it but my sister and I got followed for over a half an hour no matter which direction we went.

A nursing student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Maura left campus earlier that afternoon after packing her car and emailing her professors and work supervisor that she was taking a week off due to a family emergency. No family emergency existed.  Due to her preparations and a lack of evidence of foul play, police investigators initially suggested she may have wanted to disappear and treated her case as a missing persons investigation,  but her family and friends have maintained she was abducted.    As of February 2014, ten years after her disappearance, there is no suspect and her whereabouts remain unknown.

truecreepy,2d3wr2,soiledshorts79,11,Sun Aug 10 05:31:56 2014 UTC,"I think of slender man kinda the same way I think of shadow people; so in a way, yes I do. Slender man is cheesy with his suit and tie, but the core concept behind him make my skin crawl. He is an extra dimensional being who only has a vague form and can change his size and shape at will. You can't look directly at him, he is always just outside of your field of view until he is ready to strike and that is where his true creepiness resides. You know he's there, tormenting you with his presence, but you can't see him other than glances. If you do get a good glimpse of him it is hard to wrap your head around him. Shape shifting, grossly extended limbs, a blank head with no face.... that's some creepy imagery.   It is a scray concept, but being a full on internet created sensation does take a lot away from his creep factor. Memes aren't scary, and slender man has made it into the meme hall of fame. Shadow people are what I look for when I want the kind of scare slender man is going for, pretty much the same recipe without all the suits and 4chan."
truecreepy,2d3wr2,jayfatha,8,Sun Aug 10 02:34:29 2014 UTC,"I think he certainly used to be, when he wasn't so, at the risk of sounding like a hipster, overexposed. Slenderman is simply too basic of a creature to be that scary without that mysterious atmosphere that used to surround him. It started with Marble Hornets (which I used to enjoy very much, personally) then all the games came out...no, he's not creepy anymore, but I think he still could be if someone really knew how to use the character to his full potential. I've always really liked the idea of Slenderman, and it's disappointing to see him so overused without anyone really capturing the right combination of story, atmosphere, and mystery surrounding exactly what he is, where he came from, and perhaps some elaboration on what happens to you when he gets you."
truecreepy,2d3wr2,Misenfranchised,13,Sun Aug 10 07:35:32 2014 UTC,"Not in the least. I wish I could give you more of an explanation why not, but I liken it to someone drawing a shitty picture of some boring cartoon creature they made up and suddenly having the entire internet convince themselves it's scary. It honestly makes no sense to me. My best theory is that it's a bandwagon thing.   ""Have you heard of Slenderman? It's super scary!""   ""Well, if you think it's scary then I suppose I do too!""  ""Hey, I want to be a part of the group! I like Slenderman even more than you guys do!""  ""Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna murder my friends for Slenderman!""  And so on.  EDIT: Word bungles."
truecreepy,2d3wr2,atlaslugged,6,Sun Aug 10 00:16:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah I see what you mean, I never really thought the whole thing was actually creepy, however I did enjoy the storyline of marble hornets"

(I still catch myself watching Marble Hornets sometimes.) The mystery is gone and he's just a meme now, but the fact that he has no face is still the main creep-factor for me. Faceless humanoids make my skin crawl. That plus his apparent omniscience and the inevitability of him finding you no matter what you do was what made him scary for me.  Not anymore. It's been done to death and now the only thing Slenderman really does for me is provide the opportunity to get on omegle with a white morphmask and freak people out. Fun times."

I thought it was a cool premise for a monster.  But people have taken it too far. Slenderman's gotten too much attention and that ruined it.
truecreepy,2d3wr2,boxhall,2,Sun Aug 10 14:04:32 2014 UTC,"I am afraid you are asking the wrong question. It isn't whether or not Slendy is creepy, Slenderman is simply a tool. A figure that a writer can draw inspiration from. This is why that Marble hornets and the earlier pictures are often mentioned as the exception.   Slenderman alone is not creepy, because that is like asking if a ghost is creepy. You can have your horrifying games and movies on them, but you can also have Casper. Vampires can be terrifying as the original Dracula, but we also have Twilight.  Don't complain a bout Slenderman not being creepy, because you take the focus off of the true problem. The internet is like a virus when it comes to over saturation. Too many bad writers ruins something that a brilliant writer can make torment your nightmares and have you peeking out the curtain."

I thought when I first started hearing and reading about him it was definitely creepy. A lot of people did good stuff with some of the earlier photos and all. Again, it's the ones where he was in the background.  I know I ride my bicycle to work in the fall a lot, and it's before dawn. A lot of times I'd think how creepy he'd look standing in the cemetery I pass, or just on a quiet street under a street light, or (shudder) between two dark houses.  But like a bunch of others said, it got watered down, overdone, and that was that.  I could also see why some people woulldn't be phased by it at all. We're desensitized, it takes more then ""a guy in a tuxedo with no face"" to get to people. Look at Dracula or Frankenstein, they terrified people when they first came out. No one finds that scary anymore (I know someone would normally chime in now and tell me how wrong I am but since this post is so old I may be talking to myself)  Anyhow, good question/post"

For example if you play the game, it's just scary because of the shock moments, not so much because of him. At least in my opinion.   You could put anyone in there and you would be scared no matter what, because of the psychological aspects."

When it first emerged with the stories on /X/ and Marble Hornets, it gave birth to one of the first pieces of internet folklore. A campfire story read in solitude with the full knowledge it's just a story but with a niggling feeling in the back of the mind that something was off. It was known by few people and when you met someone who knew about it, you shared info about the various stories, creepypastas and ""documentaries"" you read.  Then, The Eight Pages came out and suddenly this little in joke you and your friends knew about became common knowledge and people everywhere became familiar with it, making jokes, posting prank videos, he even got a freaking Harlem Shake video!!! It was like when Freddy Kruger started rapping and went from murderous ghost of a child molester to crazy uncle in a red and green sweater.  I don't want to be all hipster and go for the ""I was into it before it was cool,"" thing but had it stayed the underground phenomenon it started out as then maybe, just maybe, it would have remained an entity to be feared."

This was maybe 20 years ago with 3 friends, at the very first question ""do you know anyone at this table"" the glass slides directly to me. I take my finger off the glass, so does my boyfriend, and proceed to ask questions for about 5-6 hours. In Swedish. I was the only one who spoke Swedish, the others were italian/polish/belgian.  I can only say it works. I got answers to all kinds of questions, such as ""what's my maternal grandfather's middle name"" and stuff like that. At one point, the answers were even translated from Swedish into French at the request of the others.  Nothing bad happened though, even though it was scary when we asked the spirit to leave and she replied ""No. Stay. Rooms."""

It was able to answer in multiple languages, because people who spoke different languages were there. It was able to answer those questions you asked because you knew the answers to it. A real test would be to ask it questions nobody at the table knew the answer to, but have a resource nearby to check the answers you receive. Then you'll see if it's blowing smoke or not."
truecreepy,2d1n6q,tendorphin,5,Mon Oct 13 18:56:56 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the video link. As for the idomotor effect - not so, I asked many questions in Swedish (that noone else spoke) that I did not know the answer to, and without my finger on the glass. We spent hours and hours asking questions, and the glass told me by Q&A that she was a relative to me on my mum's side - a cousin of my maternal grandfather. She met my mum once, when my mum was a baby. She married an American and they had a son, but the husband took the child to America when they got divorced. She said she was jealous of the relationship me and my boyfriend had, and started swearing in Swedish. When I didn't want to translate those words, my friends asked her to translate to French - which she did. I certainly did not know those kind of words in French...  Then, the next day, I called my mum who was in Sweden - I was living in Belgium at the time. I told her the whole story, and said ""but we don't have anyone that fits in our family"" to which my mum was silent for like 5 seconds. Scary silence, really. Then she said ""yes we do,"" and told me about her aunt Karin (the ""glass"" refused to tell me her name). Everything fit the bill - except my mum didn't know that she had had a son who was taken to America - she did know that she had married an American and that she had herself only met Karin as a toddler.  So, yes, verified by third party... there's tons more from that 5-6 hour session. I am convinced it works. Just perhaps not ready to say whether it is a spirit or not... could be something else like, I don't know, telepathy with the cosmic collective mind...? ;-)"

We closed off the session and tried to party on like nothing had happened. But shit still kept falling down in whatever room we weren't in at the time. We thought it one of us who was fucking around, so we all decided to sit in the livingroom and wait.   It was a tense moment and then we hear a loud crashing noise from the kitchen and we run in there, only to find that the dishes the host had cleaned were all smashed on the floor.

As this happened around June and July of 1975 before Squeaky tried to assassinate President Ford and before Sandy Good and Susan Murphy were arrested for writing all those letters threatening corporations and the heads of those corporations.  I'm inclined to think that it was Sandy and Squeaky who were behind the letter being sent even if they did not send it themselves.  While doing the newspaper search I found an article that tells about Manson threatening to send five people to kill Nixon and Reagan.  There seems to be a theme with the number five here between the two threats.  This article is from the Edwardsville (ILL) Intelligencer, September 11, 1975.

truecreepy,2ahjy3,qwapoozle,14,Sat Jul 12 04:16:58 2014 UTC,"I am asymptomatic to infections.   Last year I had a bladder infection that crept into my kidneys, where it got so severe they began shutting down. I lost the ability to drink and eat as I threw it all up. I got so desperate I would spray water in my mouth from a squirt bottle to stay hydrated. My temperature was in the low 40s (Celsius, or around 104 Fahrenheit) and I was heavily hallucinating. If I wasn't sleeping I was screaming for my mom, dad or boyfriend to save me. I was constantly surrounded in flames, dirt, worms or other bugs, or even once, a demonic party (from hallucinating). To top this all off, I was experiencing extreme light sensitivity and migraines. All lights were off in my room at all times and my window was covered with garbage bags.   On the third or fourth day, I was literally carried to emerg. They put me in the trauma room immediately to attempt to stabilize me. If I didn't go in, I would've lived for 3, 4 days tops. Its possible my squirt bottle saved me. Because my kidneys were so badly infected and were beginning to shut down, I was admitted. I was put on a heavy IV to try to hydrate me, along with a strong antibiotic. They soon discovered I couldn't breathe.   To explain this, there are different breathing percentages. I'm no nurse, but I'll try my best. The level is measured by the amount of oxygen you're taking in. 95+ is healthy, 94-89 is okay, below 88, you get put on oxygen. At 78%, your lungs go into respiratory arrest and you start to suffocate. They put me on at 85% and after a day, sometime in the evening, an alarm went off. My level dropped to 74%. I was able to stay conscious (doctors were baffled) and talk throughout. I was telling my mom how badly I missed home when it went off, actually. As the nurses rushed in, I was still observing and talking and breathing, but as they scrambled and my vitals dropped, something happened.  I was still conscious. I could see everything in reality: my mom, the nurses, the trauma doctors. I could hear and talk. However I saw something else at the same time, like a memory. I saw the few lights fade and turn softer. Everything calmed and quieted. I could hear all of it but also none. The closest thing I can use to describe is having a song stuck in your head. You can hear it even though no one else can, and also hear what's going on in the real world. Anyways. It got darker and softer, and nearly silent. There was a light hum. It wasn't annoying. Just peaceful. I felt nothing. The excruciating pain was gone. I couldn't feel the blanket or people touching me. I felt nothing. I was at such tremendous peace with the world. One thought went through my head: I'm dying. Then: This is okay.   I laid there, as everything faded and my breathing slowed. I still saw and heard everything consciously. I wasn't happy, but I was peaceful. My mom later described it as the most terrifying moment of her life. Her eldest child and only daughter suddenly stopped talking and screaming in agony and went very quiet,  the look of agony gone. Then my face looked very peaceful, something she hadn't seen in awhile.   Get ready. This part is cheesy. I knew I was dying and I was okay with it, but I knew I could make it. I decided to live. I jolted myself away from the peace and the silent hum and I took a deep breath. I would live, as I chose life.   Obviously, I made it. One of the nurses hugged me, crying. I was released a week later, albeit still weak. It would be a weeks before I could work or even go to school, and I'm still healing. Not everything the hospital did was perfect: my lungs were crushed by the excessive amount of liquid thro ugh the IV, further complicating the breathing. However, I owe them my life and I will eternally be grateful.   I soon became known as the Miracle Girl with the Shades, as I insisted on wearing them to avoid the light. I like it better than the girl who died.   Sorry for the mega post. I just thought I'd share my near death experience. I can explain the demon party if anyone would like, too."

I was also surprised with Sinister. I was expecting a typical Hollywood Horror featuring Ethan Hawke. I had to turn on the light during the scene where he watches every canister of film.

truecreepy,26zf6a,curses999,3,Sun Jun 1 19:07:26 2014 UTC,"Kill List. This film is in no way what it appears to be at first, and it is probably my current definition of creepy.    The Woman. Starts slow but trust your instincts about the characters.    The Loved Ones, an Australian movie, is immensely good. It seems to start slowly but again, give it a chance. Wonderfully over-the-top acting.    Yellowbrickroad (sic) is kind of flawed but a really, really creepy idea. Another one that has just stuck in my head forever.    And some which I always assume everybody has seen, which it would be a shame to miss:    The Wicker Man, if you haven't seen it, is very nearly a perfect film.  It's a sunshiney sort of creepy, which is unusual and a hard thing to do.  The Shining is astonishing. Has very little to do with the original book but is so shot through with deliberate tricks of Kubrick's that the brain gets kind of hypnotised by it. Watch the documentary Room 237 afterwards to have your mind blown as it explains what you've just watched.    Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity were both really good examples of found footage. It's a wildly overdone genre now and they're still the best. The original Spanish versions of REC and REC2 are good too, though, if zombies are your thing."

The earth devouring it slowly eating its uncared for body chip by chip.  Abandoned disintegrating buildings often give off uncomfortable feelings, however this building far exceeds the usual flutter of nerves.  Rumours of its previous occupants are varied and inconsistent.  Mostly believed to be local ghost stories thrown around.  It was a kind of unwritten rule before Jake to stay away from the unwelcoming place. The deep intense fear eminating from it traditionally enough to deter the most skeptical person.  Jake went one night. Desperate to win approval from his peers. Desperate to be respected instead of the community punching bag. The combination of his intense desire to win approval, and having experienced true terror that the small town native folk have never dreamed of gave him the unprecedented ability to overcome the fear.  He ventured forth toward the dark broken building, trudging through thick untouched growth, whilst many terrified wide eyes followed his slow determined progress.  He reached the base of the building.  Steps away from the doorway inside. He turned his head seeing his onlookers watching from afar. He faced his challenge, and stepped into the dark."

I knew a girl for years who a few years ago decided she wanted to 'surprise' her boyfriend who worked in the kitchen of a high rise. So, he was in the bottom 1st floor. She tried to pull a 'mission impossible' and climb through the air ducts, from the parking garage, from the 5th floor. Very sadly, she realized the bad decision she'd made when she got stuck in a narrow passage, and met her demise she was in there so long. We all knew she wasn't 'normal' but one never really imagines this could happen. So, yes, sadly this poor girl could have had something up that made her think a water tank was a good place to be."

I'm a skeptic, so I don't believe it at all, but it's a very widely known thing here.  Toyol is the Malay term if I recall, but it still refers to a child and often, strictly a baby. There is no adult version of this thing (ignoring zombies, mediums, that sort of stuff). There's some variations I've heard such as in regards to containing it, it must be kept in a glass container, no need for blood to feed it, or that it must be an aborted baby.  I scoff at it all the time so I don't really bother to dig deeper, so this is more or less what I know. A lot of people believe this and/or claim to know someone who does this.

truecreepy,1xbl1e,Degg19,12,Sat Feb 8 03:52:22 2014 UTC,"From the wiki:   The Black September Organization (BSO) was a Palestinian terrorist organization, founded in 1970. It was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes and officials, and the fatal shooting of a West German policeman, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, their most publicized event. These events lead to the creation of permanent, professional, and military-trained counter-terrorism forces of major European countries, like GSG9 or GIGN, or the reorganization and specialization of already standing units to such a group, like the Special Air Service of the UK.   The Munich Massacre:   The group's most infamous operation was the killing of 11 Israeli athletes, nine of whom were first taken hostage, and the killing of a German police officer, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Black September's official name for the operation was ""Ikrit and Biram"", after the names of two Palestinian Christian villages whose residents had been killed or expelled by the Israeli military Haganah in 1948."
truecreepy,1xbl1e,blueeyedconcrete,4,Sat Feb 8 04:46:25 2014 UTC,"Olympic organizers asked West German forensic psychologist Georg Sieber to create 26 terrorism scenarios to aid the organizers in planning security. His ""Situation 21"" accurately forecasted armed Palestinians invading the Israeli delegation's quarters, killing and taking hostages, and demanding Israel's release of prisoners and a plane to leave Germany. Organizers balked against preparing for Situation 21 and the other scenarios, since guarding the games against them would have gone against the goal of ""Carefree Games"" without heavy security."

truecreepy,1x9h8i,elviramoose,19,Fri Feb 7 10:18:01 2014 UTC,"First image was posted on /r/creepy some time ago. OP for that thread said it was a dead body that fell from the ceiling the exact moment the picture was taken, but someone else commented and said it was a staged photo. Neither claim was ever verified as far as I can remember. Second image looks a bit like a photo people used to take with family members even after they had died. There are similiar pictures of families along with dead children or elders who are posed specifically for that photo. Looks just as creepy as it sounds. Third image looks like a poster attached to the inside of the window. Fourth and fifth images are appearantly pictures of crime scenes. Can't tell if they are staged or real though. Sixth image is a simple double-exposure. The guy in the seventh image is holding a microphone. Looks staged. Picture eight is once again a double-exposure. The ceremony looks like some kind of funeral, can't tell for sure. I know nothing of the other images.   EDIT: I spell gud!"
truecreepy,1x9h8i,Berjj,9,Fri Feb 7 12:14:52 2014 UTC,"I'll try my best to expand on your points:   The first image WAS staged, as if it were a picture of the family, they wouln't have been off-center.  Especially since (minus the body) there's nothing interesting going on on the left hand side of the picture. You're right on the second, third, fourth and fifth pictures. Fourth picture is of a gun shot wound to the head, fifth is a murder suicide.  Though these are not really for this subreddit.  The sidebar specifically states ""This is not /r/gore!  If you want gore, go there."" Correct on the sixth picture. The seventh picture is purportedly from a concert by the band Vår (from /u/agiantpoo's comment). Right again on the eigth!  It looks like a staged sacrifice for satan.  Why staged?  Well, where are the pentagrams?  It might be from a movie. I'm pretty sure the ninth picture is of dolls.  Look at the legs on the far left and far right  children.  Unless their bones are liquefied, legs wouldn't bend and flatten like that. Tenth picture looks like it might be from a reenactment of something to do with the crusades.  Why else would you have Knight Templars? I'm pretty sure the eleventh picture is a painted mannequin.  Not 100% though. 12 is a lovely picture of people in a forest with some horrible white balancing. 13 and 14 are both art projects by Kon Trubkovich and Regina Parra.  Source here."

There are many more examples of Rule of 3rd, but being off center and having increased headroom are the most typical."

Luckily for me nothing has physically moved though, just things I've seen, heard or felt. So maybe it's all in my head. I usually find it comforting to imagine my grandfather or someone like that hanging around to protect me, or a guardian angel - anything to help me feel at ease.

Located at 176 Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the Winecoff Hotel was advertised as ""absolutely fireproof."" While the hotel's steel structure was indeed protected against the effects of fire, the hotel's interior finishes were combustible, and the building's exit arrangements consisted of a single stairway serving all fifteen floors. All of the hotel's occupants above the fire's origin on the third floor were trapped, and the fire's survivors either were rescued from upper-story windows or jumped into nets held by firemen. The fire was notable for the number of victims who jumped to their deaths. The fire, which followed the June 5, 1946 La Salle Hotel fire in Chicago with 61 fatalities, and the June 19, 1946 Canfield Hotel fire in Dubuque, Iowa with 19 fatalities, spurred significant changes in building codes, most significantly requiring multiple protected means of egress and self-closing fire-resistive doors for guest rooms in hotels.

Now 4 yrs. later it's no joke. For me it's intense itching and pain, what comes out feels like tiny shards of glass. Extremely painful and they only half heal and simply move a little leaving scar tissue behind. I will try to find some of the very first video's I seen about this, they were very compelling. I personally have not had ""the feeling like something is crawling under my skin"" but had an episode when the lesions were really bad where I had just laid down in bed and an electrical current like feeling went all the way thru my body for about 4 seconds. It was surreal. I just laid there thinking what the &*% was that? As of now I pretty much have the lesions under control. For now. If I have gotten this many negative votes already, I guess I shouldn't go into what I know. I have seen things with my little scope that literally made me throw up. I no longer look."

It's called seeing the real reality of how messed up things are becoming instead of ignoring or sticking your head in the sand. I think I may be able to help you understand what MAY be happening. It's affecting a lot of folks, I think people are just afraid of what they are experiencing (rightfully so!) but everyone around us who feels the same way may think it's just them so they pretend it's all good. We really do need to open up to each other, not judge, or hold these feelings inside. But people can be so cruel and untrustworthy and that's what hurts the most. I can tell you have a beautiful soul and I am so sorry for what you are going thru. I have also had many strange events, most I will chalk up to....the sun reflecting off of swamp gas due to the aurora borealis:) However 6 things have happened in which no amount of logic, rationale, or deductive reasoning explains it.

truecreepy,1ouhfr,sucka90,5,Mon Oct 21 02:15:35 2013 UTC,"Thats a whole other idea- that this was an SEO experiment. I seriously just started looking into all of this tonight after a friend posted a video of it on facebook and became super interested. Too bad it was almost a year later. I didn't even know what an SEO (search engine optimization) experiment was. But yeah, I'm not saying this is true, but the fact that things weren't looked into further has made a lot of suspicion about this being one because of the fact that during this exact time there was a TB outbreak in the exact same area but if you googled anything about it, because of the popularity in the elisa lam case, you would only find results on that. Thats a super brief explanation, but this other post on reddit goes into much more detail about it: LINK  In the convo they get into some pretty deep/outrageous theories that are a bit off topic, but the initial responses are the main point behind the theory and explains why the whole thing could have been dropped/forgotten(fabricated?). They also mention that she was said to have had a strong online presence but i haven't read any sourceable articles on that, but i went ahead and looked her up on facebook and twitter and correct me if im wrong, but she dosen't seem to have ever had either.  EDIT: These are some sourceable articles that make this theory so plausible:   Here is a LINK from 2009 talking about the LAM-ELISA diagnosing  Here is another LINK about the TB outbreak that happened in Skid Row, where Elisa Lam was found dead. The article was posted Feb 21st which was 2 days after her body was claimed to have been found. Though i'm not sure when her case was first released to the public, i assume it was sometime after.  Here is a final LINK in response to that last one that talks about the seriousness of the problem and asks some really good questions:  ""How do I stay safe? How will you stop the spread? And why did it take so long to share the news of an outbreak that's five years old?"" ... ""An Occupier hung around just long enough to accuse 'the press and the government of using the news to vilify skid row.' A woman from nearby Little Tokyo wondered why police officers were advised to don masks but residents told not to. And a former skid row resident who now lives a few blocks away said the outbreak is bound to reach beyond the homeless and the poor""  idk.

There is a facebook LINK but it only has 18 friends with the majority attending ""Summit Middle School""(?), one picture which is of the portrait you see on all the articles, and if you click ""2013"" on the right, you can sometimes catch the months drop down to January but I'm not sure if thats when it was created because it all disappears in a flash unless you refresh the page and try again. Either it's protected, or just a glitch so idk if the page is legit or not.  There is also a memorial fan page LINK, but its only full of people who are all curious about the case and yet not one person on there who claims to have known her. I mean, Canadian's use facebook... And she was 21. So wouldn't there be at least ONE person on there who knew her and would add to the discussion? Maybe clear things up a bit?  I started out being pretty skeptical about all this, but the more i look deeper into it, the more I'm seriously considering that she might not even be real... whaaaaaahhhtthaaafuuuuuqqqq"

truecreepy,1ouhfr,AlexP222,3,Tue Jan 21 03:48:59 2014 UTC,Hi Im actually an SEO exec and was wondering what you meant by SEO experiment? I tried reading the thread that you linked to but it makes no sense to me.. I know of the story but fail to see what SEO has to do with it? Besides SEO'ers are technically savvy and far too geekish to murder someone for the sake of a ranking experiement when non harmful SEO experiments would be just as fruitful if not moreso as mediaoutlets and press websites will always have strong rankings due to their high domain authority. Sorry dont mean to rude or anything but I dont understand why this could be linked to SEO.
truecreepy,1ouhfr,impossible_geometry,3,Thu Oct 31 16:21:23 2013 UTC,"What I understood from his explanation was that actually no one was killed and a woman was invented and ""killed"" for the sake for the experiment."
truecreepy,1ouhfr,AlexP222,1 point,Mon Nov 4 03:02:56 2013 UTC,"Having re-read this I think I understand what is meant. There was some secret project named 'Lam Elisa' that the US government wanted to keep secret so they killed a girl called Elisa Lam which then flooded the search results so that anyone searching for the secret project would instead be returned results linked the death of that girl. This works in essence but there are easier ways for the government to push rankings for people searching for 'Elisa Lam' or 'Lam Elisa', especialling seeing how power the NSA is, so cant believe that they killed this girl in order to hide search results."
truecreepy,1ouhfr,sucka90,2,Mon Nov 4 15:40:54 2013 UTC,"Close! There is nothing about an experiment called ""Lam Elisa"". The test to diagnose TB is called LAM-ELISA so when searching for info on this test for the LA TB outbreak, you would get articles on the girl instead. If you read the articles i posted about about the TB outbreak you can see how concerned the public actually was(is?) about it when they found out and question why it took so long for the info to be released. And yes part of the theory is that there was never a girl who died. All of it was just used as a distraction."
truecreepy,1ouhfr,sucka90,1 point,Tue Nov 5 06:43:29 2013 UTC,"No worries. I myself don't know much about them, so you're right in questioning my understanding. As i said before i had only just heard of them after reading about it in the other reddit post i have linked in my writeup. But the theory is that this story of a girl dying was made up in order to distract the public from what was really going on in Skid Row. So during that time when googling for something like ""people sick in LA from contaminated water"" or ""LAM ELISA Tests for contaminated water LA"" (or idk) You were more likely to get some story about the girl rather than the water born TB outbreak because it was more published and popular in the media at that time. So maybe claiming that the whole thing was JUST for an SEO experiment isn't correct, but insead saying that SEO played a large role in this would have been more accurate. But again, all this was just a theory that was brought up by someone else and this is just my interpretation of it and what i've built upon it since I came across the claim :)"
truecreepy,1ouhfr,ansible47,2,Tue Nov 5 06:21:19 2013 UTC,"That is a beautiful explanation, but it's also incredibly convoluted. It's convenient that the test happens to be named LAM-ELISA, but what else could they realistically do this with? It also wont work more than once or twice, since the pattern would become to clear.  I'm not disputing that it was staged, because I like the explanation so much, but the motive is a little shaky. Just an experiment, I suppose."

truecreepy,1ouhfr,evildead4075,9,Mon Oct 21 02:33:17 2013 UTC,No way to really know unless someone here goes and actually sees if all the descriptions are accurate and tests if roof really is as secure as they claim.  Also if you look at the Google Maps of the hotel you can easily tell how she probably climbed the adjourning structure to the right of the tanks to get on top of them.

truecreepy,1ouhfr,EdgHG,6,Mon Oct 21 13:00:38 2013 UTC,Probably shitty security.  Lowest common denominator you know?  Doors were locked and padlocks placed after the fact to avoid having the fire marshall crawl up their asses and shut them down.  The hotel she was staying at is known to be pretty shady.

Right now there's 2 theories: she was on a hallucinogen and that explains why she was acting weird; she kept hitting the door open button and the elevator was old, explaining the reason why the door remained open so long. She made her way to the roof by either using one of the 2 doors that had broken alarms, or she used the roof-access door that was unlocked and kept open by the employees that would go up there for a break/smoke (because it's a bad area of town). So she gets up there and feels hot because of the drugs, so she takes off her clothes and then notices the water towers...so she (somehow) winds up onto that platform that was above the water towers and she went in through the holes in the top (which, for some reason, had been left unlocked by the maintenance man) and somehow fits; once inside the tank, she can't get out and succumbs to exhaustion, causing her to drown.  OR  She was possessed. The hotel has a history of being a haunted hotel, which is just compounded by the fact that the Night Slasher serial killer stayed there on the 14th floor while he murdered 14 people (which was, oddly enough, the floor she happened to be on). She first entered the elevator noticing something was wrong and pressed any button to get away. She then sticks her head out of the elevator to try and see what was giving her such an uneasy feeling and then by the time she's fully out of the elevator, she knows what's happening. She goes back into the elevator and tries to hit every button to try and escape, but there's no way whatever's possessing her is going to allow those doors to shut. She's forced to walk about out and then, by the possessor entering her body, she begins to contort and jerks sporadically. Then, once completely possessed, she's taken to the rooftops and mercilessly drowned in an area that would both take a long time to find her and would cause horror on the tenants as they drink her decomposing body.  Those are the two theories (the second one probably changes with whomever is telling it), but the thing about it is no one really knows and we may never."
truecreepy,1ouhfr,-bolo-,14,Mon Oct 21 01:41:13 2013 UTC,"Drugs, sure, but to put possession as more likely than a murderer? No way.

Theory 3: It was all an act. She practiced the whole camera scene beforehand, pulled it off alright, and then ran up to her room, grabbed the dead body she purchased, did some leprechaun magic on it to make it seem like her, threw it in the tank, and then ran away with her Irish bodyfriend.  She's still probably alive, really. Chances are good.  Edit: I'm not really advocating this theory above any others, just telling all three!"

What I see...  -she gets in the elevator with an almost, 'you can't stop me, I'm gonna get in that elevator and go call the police' attitude. So, she presses all the buttons cuz she really doesn't care what floor she gets to as long as it's not the one she is currently on. - when the doors won't close she flashes her head out to see if anyone is there. Possibly doesn't even see the person on the right cuz she looked so fast. -Then I believe she hears some person outside the door so she hugs the right wall hoping he will think just maybe she didn't get on the elevator and will walk by and go looking for her elsewhere. - when she realizes the elevator won't go anywhere she walks out slowly. then stomps the ground almost like she is having a tantrum. -the person then begins to instruct her what to do...""take a step left, now take one step back"" which puts her in the elevator so he tells her to come out and take another step left...this puts her almost out of frame with the elevator camera but not all the way. -she can't believe this is happening and gets back on the elevator to try the buttons again. once she realizes they will not work she gets out and converses with someone again. making dramatic hand gestures almost like imitating the person she is talking to, possibly her murderer, ""oh im so and so and im gonna do this and not get caught.""  -then i believe she is listing off offenses or things this person will get arrested for or something of that nature. the person tells her to step away from the elevator so he can remove his key that has kept it ajar the whole time. once the attacker feels she is a safe distance away where she cant jump back in and have it take her to another floor he releases his key."

Some people, myself included, think it's for content, real or fabricated, that is creepy in the true sense of the word (as in ""truly creepy""). Some think it's for creepy stories/images/etc. involving true events...in which case I think /r/MorbidReality is more appropriate.   I'm not saying one side is correct and the other is incorrect. Either way, I enjoy this subreddit much more than I do /r/creepy. Whether this subreddit focuses on the former or latter is of little concern to me.

I forget where I heard this but I heard about a couple who were in the park getting freaky and they parked with their car facing toward the woods. They see these lights in the distance start to come toward them and they realize it's a bunch of people wearing robes carrying torches. So the couple is freaked out and they turn their headlights on to see what the hell is going on, and the people drop to the ground and start to CRAWL toward their car! Needless to say they got the hell out of there, and heard a while later about cult abductions that took place in that very same park. Creepy..."
truecreepy,1mwz9m,pizzatuesdays,38,Sun Sep 22 23:54:41 2013 UTC,"Now for something that actually happened.  My fiancé was chilling with her friends on a pier late at night and the pier was completely empty except for them. They heard meowing and looked over to see a guy walking oddly towards them. They started to get kinda freaked out, but then the guy got closer and they noticed he had a cat in his arms and he was carrying it like a baby. He was shrouded in a heavy jacket, but he didn't look at them when he walked past and just went to the end of the pier with the same odd meowing coming from his direction. The group was quiet and it was fairly obvious that they were focusing on the man and the meowing cat, but they shook it off and began talking in low whispers, tying to get back into the conversation while the man stood at the end of the pier a good 10-so feet away. Suddenly, they heard a meow and a great splash coming from the end of the pier; they all stopped talking and turned towards the man at the end of the pier, who was now turned fully towards the group, no longer holding a cat in his arms. The group was in complete shocked and the mans shrouded head tilted up towards them, and suddenly the same meowing noise they heard before started coming from him.  Of course, they all ran. They man stayed there at the end of the pier as they jumped into their cars and drove off, terrified."

truecreepy,1l9rh0,mapdrumsticks,55,Wed Aug 28 17:19:04 2013 UTC,"I am not sure of the veracity of this particular article, but I can confirm that going without sleep for a long period of time will mess you up very badly.  A number of years ago I went off a medication cold turkey. Long story short, as a result I had some unexpected reactions to quitting, one of the most significant that I couldn't sleep. I would try to sleep, desperately wanted sleep, but I couldn't. Time after time I would lie down and attempt to sleep, and sometimes I would be able to drift into a state where I was ALMOST asleep; but I could never fall completely below the threshold where my conscious mind shut off entirely and I fell into slumber.  This went on for 10 days, maybe two weeks. The nights were sheer torture. The hours went by so slowly. After some days of the above I thought I was a ghost flitting through the land of the living. It was painful--sheer agony,  although I'm not sure how much of that was due to lack of sleep and how much was due to withdrawal from the medication.   Eventually one day I found myself in the shower, just screaming at nothing.  The body and mind have an incredible ability to forget pain and it is difficult for me to remember much about that time now other than I remember it being the most profound experience a person could experience outside of of outright death. I learned a lot about suffering and the world of sickness, and the barrier that springs up between the healthy and unhealthy, at that time.  I was put back on the medication and slowly came back to normal, although it took a couple years before I was anything like ""healthy."" The first sign that I was recovering, to me, was that I fell asleep and had an incredible dream in which I was flying, arcing up into the sky; and flying (in my sleep) was just joyous, I had joy in my heart, I was like a wild bird or something fulfilling some basic element need through flying, probably what an eagle feels like when it flies into the sky, designed as it is to fly.   I woke up still feeling that joy, and I knew then that the drugs were kicking in again and that I was going to be all right. It was the first good thing I had felt for weeks.  There is a ton more to this story but that is the very short summary."
truecreepy,1l9rh0,stimpakk,15,Wed Aug 28 17:34:33 2013 UTC,"The body will automatically shut itself down if you remain awake for too long. However, prolonged sleep deprivation has serious effects on the psyche which would manifest typically in aberrant and sometimes psychotic behavior. My own personal record is three and a half days and on the third day, I had vivid hallucinations and a problem to distinguish if I was talking or thinking.   Worst is that once you get into that land that you mention, it's like reality becomes infinitely thin like a membrane, and you're just wondering when it'll tear.  But, the events described in this creepypasta are just fictional, if someone could have replicated this they would have done so already and published it. However, it still makes for a great story."
truecreepy,1l9rh0,MadCervantes,5,Wed Aug 28 19:32:40 2013 UTC,"I had a friend who after 3 days of no sleep, due to taking too much adderall began hallucinating and sending garbled text.

truecreepy,1l9rh0,Numb1lp,5,Sun Sep 15 00:47:53 2013 UTC,"It really was a great story, too, and kind of fictionalized what happens when a person is not allowed to sleep. However, like you pointed out, the brain will get its sleep whether you're willing or not. I forgot the name of the condition, but it's similar to narcolepsy. I just feel like the ending was a total copout. I'm not saying ambiguity was bad, there was just so much promise, and the author must've just ran out of ideas."

truecreepy,1l9rh0,szp,15,Tue Jan 7 18:02:05 2014 UTC,"It's a cool story but it's also a horrible perpetuation of misinformation from the perspective of sleep research. It's a rapidly developing field that is revealing some interesting information about the role of sleep and dreaming in animal life. It turns out that the effect of sleep deprivation isn't as simple as ""you go crazy and do crazy things!""  Fun fact: there is a drug called modafinil which manipulates the brain's sleep functions via a mechanism not yet understood. Being a pretty recent invention, what it is capable of is still being tested. Military trials have shown that constant daily dosing of modafinil has helped soldiers remain fully alert and combat-ready for 88 hours. At the end they didn't flip out -- they just lost focus and, when the chemical was run through their system, they went to sleep.  If you are into neuroscience sort of thing, sleep research is fascinating! Look into it and you will find out other, more realistic ways people can lose their shit due to sleep problems. Sleep paralysis is interesting.  EDIT: Words."

But as far as it's known, sleep debt seems to be a real thing. It's not linear though -- because you usually sleep for 7 hours and slept 4 hours the night before you will have to sleep 10 hours tonight. It's more visible with severe sleep deprivation. Two all-nighters in a row will make you sleep for far longer than usual, and so."

truecreepy,1iuinp,clocks52,1 point,Wed Nov 13 07:44:31 2013 UTC,I also like the way the build up their scenes.  I think they timed a lot of the scare scenes really well and are pretty effective the first time you watch it.  I feel a lot of movies I've seen recently kind of miss their mark on that note which kinda sucks.  That's why I liked this movie mostly.

truecreepy,1hsbqx,WoopAhhh,34,Sun Jul 7 04:10:18 2013 UTC,I have my fathers fathers pocket watch. When my dad had it it was on a fob made of the woven hair from his grandmother. That creeped my mom out so much that she threw it away.  People had a very different relationship with death back then. It was a lot more common for one thing and took place at home more than it does now. People were a lot more comfortable with death and the dead.
truecreepy,1hsbqx,ne7minder,22,Sun Jul 7 04:32:19 2013 UTC,Think about why we call them funeral parlors. Because they were designed to look like a parlor out of someone's home. In the old days that parlor was your home. You'd have the service in your own living room. It wasn't until death became something of an industry (which had a lot to do with the increased number of people dying outside of the home in hospitals) that this practice faded away.
truecreepy,1hsbqx,Jaberkaty,6,Sun Jul 7 11:50:15 2013 UTC,Yup! And because of the poor understanding of medicine at the time it was not unusual to keep the body for a few days just in case they were not really dead.  People really were a lot more comfortable with death then and really did view it as part of life. But then half the children born didn't live till their 5th birthday so I guess you got used to it.
truecreepy,1hsbqx,ne7minder,5,Sun Jul 7 11:56:17 2013 UTC,"It's crazy how quickly our perceptions have changed too (not that I particularly care for having a dead body in my house, mind you). But there are a couple good books on how our perception of death influenced superstition called Vampires, Burial and Death. And also there's a fantastic collection of essays by Thomas Lynch, who is a fantastic writer and was also an Undertaker. Highly recommend."
truecreepy,1hsbqx,Jaberkaty,30,Sun Jul 7 13:01:54 2013 UTC,"idk, my deceased great grandmother left me a purple velvet child elf doll that had her own blonde silvery hair flowing from under it's sewn on hat. I still have it and when i was younger i would stroke the locks in memory of her. I never thought that was strange and haven't given it a second thought. Turns out I'm a hairstylist now."
truecreepy,1hsbqx,tawnirux,12,Sun Jul 7 06:12:06 2013 UTC,"I agree, its not the object its our feeling about it."
truecreepy,1hsbqx,ne7minder,15,Sun Jul 7 11:35:26 2013 UTC,And that's the only reason things like these are considered creepy now. Death has become taboo.
truecreepy,1hsbqx,NickN3v3r,47,Sun Jul 7 04:36:31 2013 UTC,"""In the nineteenth century, a morbid and curious custom has spread to various parts of the world: the photos were ”Post Mortem”. ”Post Mortem” comes from Latin, meaning after death.  The photos ”Post Mortem” apparently originated in England, when Queen Victoria asked to photograph the corpse of an acquaintance or a relative, so she can keep as a souvenir. soon after, this idea spread around the world, keeping a morbid reminder of loved ones that have passed on.  Even today, as strange as it may seem, some places still have this custom.  The girl who is standing in the photo is the one who is dead.  This is a classic example of photographic art.   Notice the hands.  If you are wondering how the corpse is made to stand  The girl in this picture has her eyes open, but in some cases the photographer will paint pupils on the eye lids to make it seem like they are wide awake.  One of the reasons they were so popular was that, while protography started to become popular at that time, it was still expensive, and sometimes the families couldn’t pay for take pictures of their children or other relatives often. So, they did it when said people died so, this way, they would have at least one memento of them.  Sometimes, the photos themselves were painted, to make the corpses look a little more “alive”. A lot of manipulation techniques were used.""  Source  More examples"
truecreepy,1hsbqx,rodneykm,11,Sun Jul 7 04:15:58 2013 UTC,This both extremely fascinating and disturbing. Thank you OP.

truecreepy,1hsbqx,RdmGuy64824,12,Mon Aug 26 03:06:42 2013 UTC,"The phenomenon of using a stand to hold up a dead body for post mortem photography is a hoax (link). Post mortems can sell for lots of money, and sellers realize this.   The girl in the photo, to me, looks 100% alive. Granted, her hands do look dark. I wonder if she may have been a sufferer of Raynaud's phenomenon/disease, which constricts the blood vessels in the hands and causes discoloration."

truecreepy,1dgg48,szp,9,Wed May 1 19:14:55 2013 UTC,Would you feel sorry for someone who has had rape fantasies and acted upon them?
truecreepy,1dgg48,PotatoMastercater,12,Wed May 1 23:10:51 2013 UTC,"I wouldn't feel sorry for the rapist meeting the iron fist of justice. We live under a social contract and someone who is willing to violate someone else should be punished and rehabilitated.  But what about someone who has rape fantasies that he doesn't want? If that person does act on those fantasies, the crime is no less heinous. But it's tragic when that person knows such urges are detestable and grotesque and hates himself for having them, but can't do anything about it. There is not even a hope of rehabilitation.  Life is unfair. Some people are born with an incomplete body. Some people have mental conditions that incapacitate them. Such cases are pitiable to (I would assume) all people. But Sagawa is a cannibal who did the unthinkable. As society, we punish him with scorn and disgust, as we much enforce social norms that keep us safe. For him, there is no pity -- just fear and shame.  And that's pitiful."

truecreepy,1cauj2,main_enigma,24,Sun Apr 14 01:07:11 2013 UTC,"Not my favorite horror movie, but the one that made the biggest impact on me was the original House on Haunted Hill.  I'll set the scene.  I was about 9 or 10 years old.  It was Halloween night, and my parents were letting me stay up as late as I wanted since it was a Friday and I didn't have school the next day.  AMC was playing horror movies all night and my dad told me I should watch this one called House on Haunted Hill.    So there I sat, lights off, at midnight, alone in my living room.  This would have been a big moment for me even if I wasn't about to watch this movie.  My parents were in bed and I was still awake and could stay awake as long as I wanted.  But then this movie starts, black and white, Vincent Price's voice pounding into my ears.  I've seen the movie since and know now that, compared to a lot of other horror movies I've seen, it's not that great.  But to a ten year old alone in his living room in the dark on Halloween night, I was terrified, but couldn't look away.  The light from the TV was the only thing keeping the terrors at bay from the darkness around me, and yet, the very thing which was creating these terrors.  I was stuck, unable to move until the movie finished.  And I'll be damned if I'm going to be sleeping after that.  It's one of those moments I wish I could recreate, but know I never will."

truecreepy,1cauj2,aliceINchainz,3,Mon Apr 15 00:07:43 2013 UTC,"I thought it was terrifying as well, because the idea that many if not most people would behave like the 'zombies' if things got rough (enough) was truly upsetting.  Random mindless violence doesn't frighten me.  Violence justified and even viewed as virtuous because ""it is needed"" or ""it's for the greater good"" or ""the circumstances warrant it"" or ""it's survival of the fittest"" is terrifying.  Because that kind of crap is the stuff governments, crusades, and all sorts of horrors can be sustained on."

For the first half of the film, I thought the characters weren't in any real danger. First I thought it'd be a prank by the guy because his gf rejected him. Then, I thought the strangers wouldn't do any direct harm, only scare them and didn't care about the consequences (an interesting concept). So, throught the whole movie I didn't get any sense of danger, and by the time they do do something, I was like oh... okay.... and that was it."
truecreepy,1cauj2,Webjunky3,6,Tue Apr 23 23:20:59 2013 UTC,"I'm curious as to why you just assume it's a joke.  Maybe you didn't see the trailer before you saw the movie but it was ""based off of a true story"" and there were very violent implications.  Do you need violence to happen for it to be threatened?  Part of what makes the movie so good is that it's an unspoken threat.  The danger is evident even without being over the top."
truecreepy,1cauj2,indeedwatson,5,Tue Apr 23 23:38:24 2013 UTC,"Yes, I read about it before watching it. It wasn't based on a particular true story, it was based on true events, apparently something that happened to the director when he was a kid, mixed with one or two murder cases, or something like that.   Do you need violence to happen for it to be threatened?   Even after violence happened (when the guy shot his brother), I got the feel that the strangers were just cruelly messing with the protagonists. To explain why I go this feeling on a technical film making level, I'd have to rewatch it. Also, as I said in another comment, psychological horror is much more effective on me than physical horror, or the threat of it. I think I've been pretty much desensitized to most horror, specially when it comes to people with masks. I can only count 2 movies that I find scary to this day (REC and A Tale of Two Sisters), and I've searched and searched and found none else."
truecreepy,1cauj2,jeepdave,3,Tue Apr 23 23:48:23 2013 UTC,I guess it's just a matter of personal preference.  I thought REC was laughable and Tale of Two Sisters incredibly boring to sit through.

It's a Spanish flick about this woman who moves back to the orphanage she grew up in to reopen it with her husband and son.  The reason I love this is because the horror is subtle when it needs to be. Not many jumpscares, really. But you're increasingly unnerved as you watch the movie until you reach the end where suddenly things start to make sense in a horrible way.  It used to be on Netflix Instant w/ English subs (it's Spanish).... I'm not sure if it's still on there. I hope it is. :/  SPOILERS  I really, really love that the bad guy in the end turned out to be the mother and at that point you're not even sure if she made up all of the ghosts or something [unreliable narrator and all that].

It's absolutely impossible now to write a plausible horror story when you're dealing with social media and networking how it is.  Even the recent Evil Dead contained far too many ""what are you a fucking idiot?"" moments.  Cabin in the Woods worked within the limitations of the genre and crushed them.  Yes, it was completely a fantasy horror but it did it so well.  It's really something we haven't seen since the 80's."

But I get what you mean. It's not for everyone. It was the opposite of Scream. They deconstruct the genre and review all the little pieces. Just like Scream it took horror fans by the hand and said ""This is horror, this is why horror is stupid and inane and broken and dead as we know it. But we love it. We've always loved it, we always will. No matter how terrible horror can get, we flood the theaters every year.""  But where Scream finished with ""And you should be ashamed of yourselves because horror movies are dead. We killed them, long live horror.""  instead Cabin in the Woods said ""Even more so, this is how we change. How we surprise, reinterpret, reinvent. This is how we keep horror fresh, and why we continue to obsess over it, and how we will continue to do so by trying something new. Long live horror, for it is undying.""  The meta information of Cabin in the Woods... SPOILER ALERT? I mean, it reaches Allegory of the Cave levels.  I understand people didn't like it.

One of the few horror films I've seen that manages to transcend age, budget constraints, and genre convention. The ending still has the ability to shock all these years later. Far from being a detriment, the black and white adds a stark and somewhat beautiful aspect to the film that amplifies the surreal sense of dread."

I know people who don't think it's that scary and others who refuse to watch it after their first time. I love it because it's one of the only movies that actually scares me. The whole idea you can just get possessed and then slowly degrade into something not even human with no visible way to fight or try to avoid it is really unsettling to me.  I also love the original Texas Chainsaw. It's so gritty and raw. It's like watching a snuff film. fishnetdiver nailed it with his description. The fact that there is just absolutely no remorse in any of the antagonists is really disturbing. TBH, I even like the remake and for different reasons. The original is more of an arthouse movie. I feel like it's more of a psychological film. The remake is a straight slasher movie. Being a huge fan of slashers, it was cool to see someone use that style on TCM."

Although it's not technically horror it is the scariest fictional film I have seen because it is about something that can actually happen like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I just love the psychological aspect of the movie and the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice/the Cops is a real horrorshow especially if you are a woman with the way he worms into the minds of everyone using the dirtiest tircks he can think of.

It's a movie where you see it once and are mildly creeped out, maybe think ""what the fuck did I just see?""

truecreepy,1c10sw,scottagro,5,Thu Jun 27 23:49:38 2013 UTC,"I thought that the concepts were mostly good, but there was just so much wrong with the execution. To me, at least.  I haven't read what the directors had to say about it, but I can only assume that they stretched the set-ups out so much in order to create a very stark and sudden contrast between them and the ""punchlines"". Of course, the only effect it had on me is making me extremely bored.  Like you, I only properly sat through the first few ones. When I realized that the long set-up trend was going to continue, I let the movie play while loafing on the internet, only giving it my full attention when it gets to the good stuff.  I feel weird bagging on it since a lot of people seemed to enjoy V/H/S so much, but, I don't know, the direction and pacing just didn't work for me."

I can't remember which director it was (Ti West, maybe?) but he said that he had no idea what anyone else was doing and his film wasn't about anything supernatural. I believe it was about a serial killer and anyway, the article said that he only saw what everyone else did when he went to the opening or whatever and then he said to his wife, ""Everyone else cheated!"" when he saw that all the other stories were about flying sex monsters and other nonsense.  But it really did have potential, that is the worst part of it.  And yes, it's always weird when you seem to be the only person who doesn't find a film amazing. I have a lot of them like that.

It isn't technically a horror film, but it has some very creepy scenes, and more importantly, it creates a profoundly unsettling atmosphere that lingers with you for a while. This applies to most Lynch films, but there aren't many others on Netflix right now. Twin Peaks, but it's toned down there, since that was made for television.  Along those lines, early Cronenberg as well, although again, there's not a ton available on Netflix. eXistenZ is worth watching, even if it's not especially scary. His remake of The Fly is classic, and if you haven't seen it, I'd recommend it."

truecreepy,1c10sw,paperbee,4,Mon Aug 19 21:26:59 2013 UTC,"If you liked the ""Second Honeymoon"" segment of VHS you should check out some of Ti West's full length features, The Inkeepers, and House of the Devil are both available on Netflix instant. Ti West is very drawn out and delivers a kind of Hitchcock style suspense, so don't expect jump-scares or pure shock/gore, it's understated and slow- that being said, Second Honeymoon was my favorite segment of VHS (the only one I really enjoyed, tbh); and so far I'm rather fond of him as a director.  I'd suggest starting with House of the Devil, its phenomenally shot and it works very well as a 1990's period-set horror flick, but it does take a little while to build up steam."

I tried to keep a poker face throughout it because I'm the horror person in my family and I don't really react to most horror movies, but I had to look away after awhile. After the movie was over me and my sisters were just quietly sitting in the living room. Ugh~ Another disturbing movie kind of like Megan Is Missing is Human Centipede.

A clearer definition of what makes solid content could really serve us well here, I think. A good amount of drawings and paintings here don't really belong at all.

Then as the kids become scared you tell your friends to ""come out."" Only to find the noises become louder. Then as you peek into the woods you see remnants of your friends tattered clothes, bloody and abused by some sort of creature. As you direct to tell the kids to stay put, you venture into the dark, cramped forest, bringing your trusty flashlight. As you yell out your friends names into the beyond, you begin to hear the same moaning and wretched inhuman calls that seem to get louder and louder... You begin to smell of something dank and bloody... Then  the screeches begin to get louder your light dims slowly... You hit it with your hand... Darker... Darker... Screeches... Louder... Louder... Then it become absolute darkness and you feel heavy breathing on your neck. With one last hit of your hand to the flash light, it brightens the forest and you see a big green Loch ness monster and he is asking for tree fiddy... And you tell 'em : ""Damn you Lochness, I ain't given you no tree fiddy!"

OK, so a summary of the document as I see it:   One world gets invaded by god like entity god like entity seems to prefer to distribute parts of itself to infect the populace. Spawns religion in the process. Humans evolve or mutate into begins which absorb other humans, mutation also seems to affect areas which takes local flora and fauna and destroys/disfigures it. god like entity also bestows advanced science on countries in the process of infecting them with ""his tears"", this is most likely to promote communication and growth God like entity then sits back and watches the world science and communicate itself to death while ""purging sin"" by infecting humans with more of this ""his tears"" stuff.   Speculation:   Colour tinge in most feeds could be the result of a transdimensional barrier distorting light feed to all foreign objects. (think of it as a lens) As each location has it's own unique location, distortion is different each time.  Personnel that returned the final time displayed symptoms after a while, this could have been an intended effect in order to promote infiltration into society. This is most likely utilized as a terror weapon."

While I understand the notion of getting bored with it and giving up, dismissing them by asking ""How exactly are these creepy?"" is sorta like wondering why people liked The Usual Suspects and consider it to have a twist ending when you gave up on it completely after a half hour.  You didn't read it and the subsequent documentation of the exploration.  You have no frame of reference to determine ""Creepy"" or ""Not Creepy"", and yet you're making a determination that they are not.  I know, you aren't explicitly saying ""It's not creepy"" but the question you ask carries the connotations, intended or not, of ""This isn't creepy, someone explain to me why I'm wrong because right now, I'm thinking you're all easy to spook and/or stupid""  And that's why you're getting downvoted by others.

I've tried reading them all, even the montauk one but I guess I'm just dumb. I don't understand them and they don't scare/creep/terrify me.   And yes, you're right I was asking someone to explain it to me because there are a large number of people who find them terrifying and I, for the life of me, can not figure out, for myself, why. And that I because I don't understand them."
truecreepy,19orz7,Mashedpotatoebrain,7,Tue Mar 5 22:34:27 2013 UTC,"Fair enough.  The reason I find tem interesting is the notion of elements of horror and supernatural tales being true - all of them - and how a society might react.  The SCP Project is a capture/contain/study (but mostly contain) group that... well, captures, contains and studies objects, entities and persons who exhibit extreme supernatural powers and seeks to keep them from destroying the local/planet/universe.  The Safe/Euclid/Keter danger level is also interesting - as in, a gun that allows you to fire and destroy planets is... safe.  Because you can lock it in a box and secure the box, and the problem is essentially solved forever.  Euclid usuall represents thinking entities or objects that seem to have a will of their own and as such, are prone to escaping.  Or simply escape as part of their nature, like a ring that transfers itself to the nearest recently divorced person and causes them to immediately remarry or whatever - objects or persons who cannot simply be locked away.  And Keter, which represents objects and entities that are poorly understood and of such abilities that were they to be loosed, destruction of human society would take place.  Creatures that are nigh impossible to stop, entities that split atoms with a thought.. if you ever watched or are at least familiar with the Twilight Zone episode where there's a kid with nigh-omnipotent powers who forces the townsfolk to be happy and sends people away to the cornfield.. that's a Keter level entity - something that can unmake existence with a stray thought.  But an organization that collects, categorizes and when possible, destroys such entities is interesting.  The group-fiction aspect is also particularly interesting, as even articles that were written by one person quickly become group affairs as more and more edits take place and small things get cleaned up and streamlined."

truecreepy,19cxgt,imnotlegolas,4,Thu Feb 28 07:54:34 2013 UTC,"Horror is based on the unknown.  Not knowing what it is, why it's here, what it's motives are.  The things your mind fills in are going to be more frightening than what the creator's intentions would have been."

truecreepy,19cxgt,vandineo,10,Thu Feb 28 19:19:43 2013 UTC,"You're confusing ""A scary thing"" with ""The genre of entertainment known as horror"".  The first can be a subset of the second, but does not compose the entirety of the second.  Horror isn't inherently frightening, it's horrifying.  The horror here comes from the justaposition of the pornographic situation we expect of a nervous, giggling girl that ends up fuckin' on camera that instead plays out as an unsettling interview, a revelation of odd scarring cluing the viewer in that something is terribly wrong, and the climax of the gentleman being thrown out of the room to an unknown fate and the death of the assistant.  It is at this point that the supernatural nature of the starlet is made apparent, and from there the horror springs - the very questions you are asking are the entire reason for the thing - you are supposed to ask yourself why the starlet has the scars (Is she a dead woman seeking revenge?  Is she some demon that has to have a tell?).  You are supposed to ask what happened to the guy after he left the room (Is the starlet working with another entity?  Is the starlet a projection OF the entity that is now feeding in the hallway?  Is the starlet preying on women and had to remove the man from the room?).  You are supposed to ask what was knocking on the door (The starlet's partner?  A third party trying to save the porn producers from their fate?) You are supposed to ask if being recorded has any implications, particularly for you the viewer.  The answers to those questions are answers that, were we in the situation, we would not know.  We would have no idea what was knocking on the door.  We wouldn't know why the starlet wanted to be recorded, or even if she understood that she was being recorded (an ancient entity may not comprehend a ""Video Camera"" and what is going on, and just know that by answering the ad in the paper she can feed or kill or whatever it is she's doing).    That's horror.  Poorly done horror is one where you are given information in the story that no character would have any way of knowing.  Poorly done horror might mean we would have the answer to those questions.  Yes, there are ways that we could be given some of that information and have it make sense in context, but even in doing so that removes a lot of the unknown elements.  And the unknown is where horror lives."
truecreepy,19cxgt,heldericht,0,Thu Feb 28 20:34:07 2013 UTC,But the viewer is not a character. It is expected that the viewer is able to get SOME knowledge of what is going on even if it is something simple and short clues can still be given. The video MAMA is a good example of this. You get to know and understand the characters though their actions. This film gives nothing. Yes it is a wonderful thing to make a full story and alluding to events for the imagination to run wild with. The unknown is only good when your imagination is set to come up with more scary scenarios but this film has none of that and instead of letting the viewer being horrified they are simply confused and frustrated why the build up gave no information.

Knowing how to take advantage of these peoples morality. It's an easy trap to play the part of an innocent girl, that was uncomfortable with the idea of sex and stripping. Which brought out these people true attitude toward the subject. As I was discussing earlier with the movie V/H/S the succubus their was just as defensive and ""innocent."" I really recommend you watch at least the first short film. Also, as I said before, it's a modern interpretation of a succubus. It's rarely going to follow classic rules for the creature. Admittedly I enjoyed that it killed the women instead of the man, since the start it wasn't the male in the video the was falling from grace, but the female."

The Russian Government develops a psychoactive drug to test under extreme conditions. Just like colleges in the U.S did at the time, the Ural State Technical University used students as test subjects. But unlike in the U.S., these Russian students were not informed and were unwitting participants. Maybe a professor knew about their trip and gave one of them pills to pass out to prevent hypothermia or something.  They took the drug, it kicks in after dinner, and at some point in the night, paranoia grows into mass hysteria and the two found under the tree think the others want to kill them and rip through the tent and escape. The others give chase. In the end, they all turn on each other. The article says the physical trauma was more than a person could inflict. But what about two people? Two people jumping on someones chest could do plenty of damage. Did the autopsies contain a toxicological report? Maybe that's what the government was covering up. Not 'aliens' or secret weapons testing.   I could go into more details on my theory but I'm feeling lazy and no one will probably see this anyway."

There were scary, zany, frightening posts there, but some people did not believe that it was ""truly"" creepy. So, long ago, a group of /r/creepy subscribers seceded from the main subreddit in pursuit of content creepy enough to satisfy them. These folks didn't want to go to a place full of mindless cruelty and gore, they wanted psychological thrill along with their frights: they came to the conclusion that they must make their own subreddit! A place for creepy posts that aren't simply pictures of doodles one did in school, a place for the high-class and creepy loving people of reddit.  Thus, /r/truecreepy was born."

truecreepy,z6s3p,DrMarianus,5,Sat Sep 1 18:28:50 2012 UTC,"I am not going to post #2, 3 or 4 because they are linked directly in the beginning of the video. You should check them out. They are equally as good."

truecreepy,z6s3p,Lady1ri5,2,Sat Sep 1 18:36:54 2012 UTC,is this a sort of a Slenderman creature? This is awesome but the distortion style reminds me of Slenderman videos
